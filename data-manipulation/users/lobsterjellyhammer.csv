TheCircleTV,ffdhhxe,t3_eszy6o,1579820973.0,"All reality tv is manipulated. I don’t see why they would give help on the trivia games since they don’t really matter for anything. Maybe just to help the game along because no one knows they answer and they can’t Move on until someone gets it. 

I agree they have to be editing what ratings people are given for who. There are a few situations where it seemed like a lot of people were putting someone at the top or bottom, but that person ended up in the middle instead. 

They also have to have been selective about what conversations they show. Sometimes when the influencers were deliberating they mention attributes of characters that seem to come out of nowhere, like everyone saying Rebecca was super emotional or Adam being really authentic. I don’t remember seeing that at all, but they must have shown it in chats we never got to hear."
