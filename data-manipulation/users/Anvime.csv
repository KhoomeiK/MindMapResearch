I know that this is going to sound like a cliche, but 20 is still a very young age. A lot of my friends (both women or men) and I were still virgins at that age. It not that uncommon if you are a shy or a nerd, especially if you weren't popular in high school. We tend to be shy and to not dare to ask others out, so it makes it things difficult.

Work on your insecurities and find groups that share the same interests than you. I read that you like entomology, that's really cool. Maybe look for some hiking or nature watching groups around you. A lot of people there might share your interest in arthropods :)"

 If there's any marriage-aged females (25+) then this study doesn't mean  shit. Women at that age begin disregarding looks in potential partners  because they themselves are losing their SMV and they are looking for  stable men that will be able to provide for a family.

 Already told you how it doesn't. If the ages of the participants aren't  clearly shown then the study doesn't mean shit. It could very well all  be married women who are looking for financial stability more in a  partner than a college girl would and marriage-aged women are old crusty  dogshit, which is why they are looking to get married."

I think that you should sit with him one day and tell him about this. 

BC is very messy and has a lot of side effects (i need it because of endometriosis but i hate it). The pull out method is not only messy but veryunreliable, so if you dont want kids is not really an option.

There are thin condoms that enhance feeling. In any case most men who say that dont feel anything with condoms are exagerating to try to get condom free sex. The little increase of pleasure that he gains isnt worth the terrible side effects that spermicide or hormonal BC have on you.

Do you want kids in the future? If you dont you can ask him to do a vasectomy. Then you can have unprotected sex without a problem. If you arent sure you can freeze his sperm.

If you really want kids then the only solution seems to be condoms. I read that you are also allergic to spermicide so that minimizes the options.

If after you talk to him he is still mad. If he really cares more about feeling more pleasure than your side effect with BC... I would say to think about a divorce before you have too many things in common.
