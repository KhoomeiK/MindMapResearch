So if a fight is too easy or you just want to finish off the remaining mobs really quick, just Alt+T and your characters will go back to just attacking stuff quickly.

You can at least deposit them into an account and do the investigation later. 
If the issue is with the cashed check, Banks usually need a time frame before they cash large amounts anyways.

AskReddit,ff60xir,t3_err9f0,1579616301.0,"I've always wondered this about lawyers. How can you defend someone you know is guilty?  


I asked this to a defense lawyer once.   
He told me he started practicing law to be a prosecutor but found it boring and being a defense lawyer made more money.   
He then told me a story about how he defended a man who shot a girl in the face because she refused to pay him for the drugs she just took. Like basically ""I'm not paying you, what you gonna do? Shoot me?"" So he grabbed his sawed off shotgun and shot her.   


He defended this guy, got him a low sentence, and as soon as he got out he killed his ex wife and his daughter.   


The crazy thing is the lawyer had zero remorse about this. ""I did my job, which is to give him a proper defense. If anyone should feel remorse it's the prosecutor for not doing a better job at beating me""  


I've heard ""everyone deserves a defense"" a million times, but there's no way this type of attitude isn't evil."
