AskReddit,ffuhf2v,t3_ev5zdg,1580242009.0,"My mentally ill mother who abandoned me sends me a text wall every few years through whatever means necessary telling me how I hurt **her** by having other adult women in my life when I was a child. This year I just.. couldn't handle it again and I broke down in front of my kids and wife. 

**TL;DR - Mom abandoned me, but loves to act put upon and try to guilt me into loving her every few years. This year I found out it bothers me more than I realized and lost my shit.**

**Backstory**

She had primary custody of me from ages 1-3, but I stayed with my dad and step-mother for a couple days or a week at a time every month in the next state over. For reasons unknown to me, my dad and step-mother refused to take me for a while until my mom was begging for a break--- she said she was scared of what she would do to me if she didn't get a break. My dad/step-mother said they wanted full-custody and she agreed. 

She popped up every 3-5 years from different states and want to be in my life, throwing herself on the cross by talking about how it was such a huge sacrifice on her part to let me go, but it was what was best for me, etc. etc. 

For most of my life she has lived 1000+ miles away from me, despite having no incentive to do so beyond pretending for years at a time as though she weren't a mother. 

Every few years she pops up via facebook messenger, or e-mail , or a physical letter and writes me a passive aggressive novel about how she's **sooooo** glad that I had a **real** mother like (step-mother) who **STOLE ME** from her and how she's glad her **SACRIFICE** bought me such a privileged life. 

My dad and step-mother divorced when I was 10. I am 32. I still talk to my step-mother occasionally, but my mom has it in her head that I think of her as my real mother and she'll ruminate and let it fester until she throws a temper tantrum and starts causing chaos.

She once used a friend's facebook account to call me fat in a photo with step-mom -- I only found out it was her because she kept saying shit and started talking about how happy I looked with my **real** mother (step-mom) and she's the only person who thinks that is a thing. 

So, this year, on Christmas day when she was feeling miserable and lonely, she messaged me the typical pity-party and I just couldn't handle it anymore. I normally just ignore them.. but I started typing just to vent at first and suddenly I was in the floor sobbing and screaming and couldn't stop. My kids came to check on me and my wife had to shuffle them away and came back to see what happened. 

I have my own mental health issues, but I've never had anything like that happen. Made me realize how much of my life and emotional issues had been informed by not ever feeling like I had a mother. I was unfair to a lot of my female friends growing up because I was trying to simultaneously replace my mom and did not understand there was more than one type of love you could have for someone else. 

My fortune 100 employer has a shitty health-insurance plan and I make too much money to qualify for assistance, so I can't afford the $120+ a session for therapy, but after this I'm wondering if I don't need to figure something out."

""In countryside towns that lacked formal constabulary, local elites responded to banditry by recruiting young men into ""companies-at-arms"" to hunt down thieves and negotiate the return of stolen property, in exchange for a pardon for the thieves and a fee from the victims. These companies-at-arms were often made up of former bandits and criminals, usually the most skilled and violent of them. This saved communities the trouble of training their own policemen, but it may have made the companies-at-arms more inclined to collude with their former brethren rather than destroy them.""

todayilearned,fftftus,t1_ffta13s,1580219330.0,"Isn't that in line with the mafia, etc. origins of being a sort of militia to protect the disenfranchised? I don't have any links, etc. to support that, but I thought I read/saw somewhere that most organized crime like that was made in response to the gov't/police not doing a good job of protecting certain segments of the population. I guess it's a chicken egg, thing, though-- Did they start well-intentioned and become corrupted, or did they have nefarious intent and did good things to buy good will.
