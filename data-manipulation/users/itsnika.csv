socialanxiety,fevlpm9,t3_eqjw9x,1579398822.0,"I never count. I dont really have social anxiety back in elementary school so i usually just ask close friends since they always count. In middle school, surprisingly someone wants to actually be my friend (or they just dont have any choice to begin with) so they did the same for me. The teachers dont really pick on me btw. When i start form 6 (post-graduate if i’m not mistaken i dunno. You basically continue your studies in high school but you’re not really a high school student while your other friends go to college. It’s not really money sucking so some people choose to be a form 6 student than going to college early but you can save up to 3 years since the programme is only a year and a half and you can get diploma and when you go to university you’ll be only take up to 3 years for a degree than your other friends who went to college and spent about 5+ years there to get a degree. Sorry, got carried away.) so BTW, **clears throat** when I became a form 6 student the teachers suddenly LOVE to pick up on me. There’s no escape."

When my dad sent me to The War Of Get Out And Go Pay The Gas, he reminded me to “ask for the receipt back”. Long story short, i didnt. I walked back to the car pretending to crush something in my hand and put my hand in the bin and pull it back as if i was throwing away things. When my dad ask for the receipt i pretended to be shocked like “oh! Sorry! i threw it away” he was a little pissed but i’d rather get scold over a receipt than going back to get it from the cashier"
