My dog is 4-5 years old and she would go into garbage and try to climb on the couch then onto the dining table (they are right next to each other) all the time. So I got a dog proof garbage and moved my dining table further to prevent it. And I've moved everything she's not supposed to have out of her reach. Accidents still happen where she finds something she's not supposed to have (my Invisalign fell to the ground once and she ate it). With our other dog who's just not interested in food we can leave a cooked pork bone out for him to eat, and he wouldnt touch it where my first dog would demolish it in 30 min.

reactivedogs,fezjai7,t1_fez9s9d,1579457935.0,"I volunteered for a local rescue doing homechecks for people wanting to adopt dogs. We check their homes and talk to them for a bit to see their experience and if they'd be suitable for the dogs they want. 

All dogs live in the rescue's foster homes before these homechecks. So we know what the dogs are like after the initial shutdown periods to better assess. 

Some cases an owner can adopt a reactive dog knowingly, for example when they have no dogs and can adopt a only dog reactive one. And the rescue has its own reactive power breed dog trainer (she's one of the directors) who's very specialized in bully breeds and reactive dogs. She offers free training for anyone that adopts reactive dogs out of her rescue. They also cover cost of any existing medical conditions even after you adopt them. (some dog had cancer and all the medical expenses related to chemo were covered by this rescue even after he was adopted). 

It was only after volunteering with this rescue I realized that's the best thing any rescue could do for dogs. Assess them truely, and offer help in training and medicals after adoption. They really think the best for the dogs. And it made me realize how irresponsible it was when the other rescue I got my dog from, just dumped her at me because ""she needs a dog free house to decompress for a bit or she'd be euthanized otherwise"". There was no homechecks or asking me about my previous experience with dogs. And of course I couldn't let her to be euthanized....

The first dog I got by myself is reactive and she's also a pitbull. I imagined having a dog = taking my pup to the dog park to play with other dogs every other day. But my dog is dog reactive so I had to say good bye to dog parks.

I also experienced the same thing where she was a very different dog in the first 2 weeks. At first I thought I could tough it out and train her to get better. But it's a lot of work because I also live in a small apartment. The first month we did fine. But once she started getting more comfortable she became a lot more reactive. It's always a struggle to do the whole going out for a walk training routine. Sit, wait by the door until I open the door, only go thru the door when I say ok, wait the same for the elevator, then two more sets of apartment building doors. And when she poops two more sets of doors to the garbage room. Outside loose leash walking, check in with me every once in a while, etc. It gets very exhausting training a reactive dog especially when they are a bit freaked out by their environment. 

My parents started helping out in my 3rd month because I was getting so exhausted from walking her 4-5 times a day at very odd hours to avoid people and dogs, doing the whole going out routine just so my puppy could go potty. They have a fenced back yard and a husky mix (that my dog bit the first time they met, but later on got along). The two dogs play together in the house and in backyard. 

And my dog is minor reactive I'd say. She's only tense about other dogs and small animals, but she doesn't lunge or bark at them, she just gets too hyped and growls if they get too close. I can't imagine how difficult it would be with a more reactive dog, or if my parents didn't help me with my dog. 

As much as I love my dog and wouldn't give her away now, I have to admit I didn't understand what having a reactive dog would be like, and I was not prepared for any of this. I was having anxieties about walking my dog for months, and had to really stay calm myself so my dog wouldn't sense it."

Plays with small kids and cats you name it) the husky is a bit scared of the pit and usually let's her have her way lol. 

But somehow when my dad walks the two dogs together, the husky is always the one going coo coo, lunging and barking. While the pit is just tense, usually freezes up but doesn't react much more. My dad thinks it's because the husky thinks he got back up (the reactive pit he's a bit scared of), so he thinks he can cause troubles now lol. 

So now the dogs get walked separately, but they still play together in the back yard. :)"

But the rescue organization didn't tell me about her reactivity, not sure if they were aware at all. So I feel bad she doesn't get to run around and I send her to my parents house here and there to run in their fenced back yard and play with their dog.

polyadvice,fek7tij,t3_epkovz,1579194411.0,"I can so relate. I tried it out once because some of my friends are poly/open. And it gave me the idea that I could work on myself, my own feelings emotions insecurities while being in an open relationship where I'd be exposed to them way more, where as if it's monogamy I might never get exposed to these experiences. And I just happened to meet a guy that was poly and it was the first thing he brought up. 

For example I'm not a jealous person, and once I brought a date with me to a clubbing event and he started making out with one of the other girls there. I was like, oh so he's really into her I'll give them more space and found my own party elsewhere. But it was in an open relationship where I had to hear about the other person's feelings about someone else, their plans, intentions, and managing all that that first time made me go like ""wow what is happening to me??"". And took me a week or two to realize that was what feeling jealous was like. Then as the relationship progressed, anytime I did anything he'd be extremely upset and accusing me of breaking the rules (which I did not and I always communicated before and after). By the end of it it was just exhausting to deal. 

I definitely think I'm more in touch with my feelings and emotions now. It helped me improve as a person by connecting my consciousness to the more subconscious reactions I have, and helped me to be more independent and content with myself as one. 

I've been single for a long while now seeing different people. I don't think I'll be the poly one once I settle into an actual relationship.

I don't join challenge parties because as much as I like the 36 challenge reward, I'm too noob in the game to understand how challenge parties work etc. I can manage 24 challenges on my own playing solo and that seems ok to me since I'm having fun and it is a bit challenging but doable. I do get annoyed when I have to message bunch people before I can buy a map, but I only had to buy maps maybe 4 times this league, and i usually scroll down a lot to find someone selling for a bit more currency, as they are more likely to respond and saves me the frustration of messaging too many people. I only sell things worth 5chaos or more because I know I wouldn't want to leave a map for anything less. And when I buy items it's the same, I set min Price to be 5chaos equivalent, even if it's some super popular unique that everyone lists for 1alch, so I can get it done ASAP. 

I use trade macro to check prices to decide if something I have us worth any currency. And I look up things I want to buy on the official trade site.

He was pretty understanding. Took me out of the peer tutor class and gave me a spare block to work on physics homework in the library as long as I checked in with the librarian. (His main concern was if I left school but got into an accident elsewhere during school time it was a big problem) 

He was one of the most sensible people in my entire highschool and I'm so grateful for him. 

My chemistry teacher was also really good. There was a Chinese guy in my class who knew all the stuff we were learning in class because he's learned it all before, so he'd watch soccer on his iPad during class. At first the teacher would pick on him to answer questions, the kid knew everything and related things we weren't learning too. So the teacher gave him special permission to join the PE class to play sports during chemistry class. As long as he kept up with our progress. It was a way better use of time imo and he was still in school under teacher supervision"

We send our reactive dog to a boarding/daycare place where dogs don't get socialized with other dogs unless they are friendly and not reactive. So our reactive dog plays only with our other dog when they both go, so she wouldn't get overwhelmed. It's just about finding something that works for your pup."

reactivedogs,fdrle5g,t3_emus9s,1578686233.0,"All the local boarding places can handle reactive dogs here. Have you asked around? 

I have a 50lb fear based reactive pitbull. She gets anxious and tense about pretty much anything, doesn't like dogs (took weeks to get her and our other dog to get along and mostly due to our other dog being really patient and leaving her be when she's over threshold). We've sent her to boarding where dogs each get their own kennel with indoor portion and outdoor runs, the handlers know the situation and only let her out into the bigger yard by herself or with our other dog to play, and they do this minimum six times a day. But honestly I don't think she even likes playing or running outside. When I take her to dog park at odd hours to run around without other dogs. She just goes to the gate wanting to go home after 5 min."

AskReddit,fdmjanl,t3_em2vfz,1578551959.0,"I still think it's a good rule. In my house if we don't finish whatever food is in our bowl/plate, we wrap it up and put it in the fridge and eat it the next meal. We wouldn't get new food until we finish all our leftovers. We didn't need to eat everything on the dining table, just leave foods we didn't like in the public plates, but as soon as we pick it up to put in our own bowls it was our responsibility. 

I think it's a pretty fair rule and taught us how to make decisions and plan, and not to waste food."

I'd that supposed to happen too? Helppp. And if anyone has a great guide on fighting Sirius please link me.

On the other hand I was walking my dog in the dark back alley once (only way to get back to my apartment back door). My dog decided to take a dump in one of the bushes in the darkest spot of the alley so I stopped to wait for her. Another guy came along with his little chihuahua who started barking at us, but guy didn't see my dog and probably didn't see me clearly either cuz I had a giant coat and my hood on (it was raining and cold). He froze and tried to grab his phone for a flashlight to see what's up. Didn't move for like a good 5-10 seconds after he lit his flashlight and at this point my dog was freezing up too cuz some random dog waa barking at us and a dude blinding us with a flashlight. I asked the dude if he was gonna keep walking. He said ""yeah I'm going that way what are you doing?"". I said ""my dog is taking a poop I'm waiting for her and I think your dog is freaking my dog out a bit with all the barking"". He quickly realized the misunderstanding and apologized then kept on walking. Gave me a good laugh lol."
