He is know for spraying machine gun fire on a whim to get a villian, using grenades, and even decapitating people. Heros dont target him but despite his brutalitity he gets the job done without a single injury.

Savage is able to imbue a striker effect on times he touches or has touches within the last couple minute. When the item causes physical arm to another, as soon as the object is removed, the wound disappears a couple second after happening. A moment later it reappears, except slightly less serious. Then disappears again. This cycle of disappearing and reappearing contiues until the wound ni longer exists and the victim is left completely unharmed. To the u trained eye this can look similar to a grey boy bubble. But it does not last forever and can even have a positive effect on those hit. As recently received wounds not made by Savage also start to disappear.

Savage also experiences the same effect when wounded. Giving him a high brute rating in addition to his striker power. Because of this he's known to dive into dangerous situations and throw himself at the most deadly person around.

**Appearance:** Daniel is 17 years old and has curly black hair, dark green eyes, and a large nose. He stands at 5 foot 8 and is about 45 pounds overweight. In addition he walks with a small slouch making him look smaller. Daniel typically wears a pair of dark jeans and a plain dark t-shirt.

Rayleigh is 5 feet 9 inches and 150 pounds. She has light brown hair down to her waist, delicate facial features, and light green eyes.She typically stands with good posture and has a perpetual smile on her face. When transforming she starts off with her costume on. 

**Bio:** Daniel Ericson has always been one to just drift through life. His parents had kids more out of obligations than love and once he reached infancy they quickly lost interest in him. Instead using their wealth to travel the world and leave him to be raised by several different nannies. The nannies where never around long enough for him to gain a connection with them and by 11 they simply just left him home alone. Most days Daniel spend every waking moment outside of school watching tv, playing video game, and going online. Finding refuge in fantasy from school and his lonely life. Daniel ended up becoming an awkward and weird kid who couldn't connect with others. All that, combined with his hatred go his looks and body made him a perfect target for bullies. For years his school life was a living hell and the only thing that kept him going was the fact he could get home later and lose himself in fiction. To escape this he did everything he could to take attention away from himself. He didn't talk to anyone else, sat at the back of the class, and dressed as blandly as he could to become a face in the crowd. And for the next 4 year Daniel lived like this, just barely getting by every day.

In the march of 2015 Daniel woke from a dream in which he was flying though innumerable lights and over a vast ocean. Every possible colors danced around him in a million different ways. It felt so real and beautiful but as He tried to focus on it again tried to focus on it Daniel felt a great pressure on his chest. The feeling grew painful as it spread until his entire body felt as it was being crushed from every angle. Then, with a brilliant flash of light, every one of his atoms converted into pure energy and was reshaped. It was only after several minute of hyperventilation that he realized he was floating several feet off the ground. His body transformed into that of a 20 something woman wearing a superhero costume. Confused and disoriented Daniel did the first thing that came to mind and flew out the window with blinding speed. It was his first night as a hero and it wouldn't be his last.

#**Powers**

**Transformation**

 * With a a thought Daniels body converts into bright white energy with shifting colors at the edges. Over the course of 10 milliseconds the energy condenses into Rayleigh. In this form Daniel gains the ability to utilize a variety of powers.

**Standard Energy Projectition**

 * While tranformed Rayleigh essentially has access to an internal well of energy that they can project and transform in a variety of ways listed below. She is able to use one of these Standard Techniques at a time and switching between them takes 10 microsecond(excluding her shield.)

 * Whether in slashes, projectiles, or beams Rayleigh can expand the radius of her energy attack up to 6 feet wide. Thoigh the energy of the attack is already out as a result. They may also shrink the radius, weakening them by the difference in size.

 * Beams can be any visible color or even a swirl of multiple colors

Techniques Name|Speed|Description|Output|
---|---|---|---|---
**Shots**|Mach 1|They create an orb of energy at the end of their Stave that fires off in straight line in whatever direction Rayleigh chooses. The orb is about the size of a human fist and strikes for up to 150,000 joules. Orbs can be shrunk to the size of a penny or 6 feet wide, with the power being decreased or spread out proportionally. |8 per second. Up to 40 per second at lower powers.|
**Beams**|Mach 2|Rayleigh points her stave in the desired direction and dires out a beam of energy in a straight line. The beam is 6 inches wide, moves at mach and outputs a consistent rate of up to 1.3 megawatts. Beams can be shrunk to the size of a pencil or expanded to 8 feet wide, with the power being decreased or spread out proportionally |N/A|
**Slashes**|Mach 1|Raleigh swipes her Stave and create a line of energy 5 feet long, paper thin, and 1 foot wide. The slash fires off and cuts for 5 kJ/mm2. The slash can be expanded up to 30 feet wide, growing duller as it does so.|8 per second. Up to 40 per second at lower powers.|
**Bursts**|500 mph|They create a ball of swirling energy at the end of their Stave that fires off in straight line in whatever direction Rayleigh chooses. The orb is about the size of a pingpong ball. When it it hits a surface or reaches a predicided distance its explodes for up to 180,000 Joules . |4 per second. Up to 20 per second at lower powers.|
**Shield**|1 Millisecond summoning time| bubble of hard light energy encircles Rayleight at a distance of anywhere from 5 to 30 feet. The shield is able to take 2.5 MJ before shattering  |A new shield can be summoned 3 second after shattering.|
**Telekinesis**|N/A|Rayleigh can target a single object or area of object up to 5 tons of weight. The areas close with a visible aura of energy. By moving their Stave in the desired direction they can move the objects/area up to 10 MPH. She is unable to target a person or anything a person carrying.|One object or area at a time.|

**Special Moves**

 * Explosive Strike

  * Rayleigh collects energy around the head of her Stave over the course of X seconds. During which she must stay completely still. When this finished the enegybstays there and she can move around normally. The next time she is able to hit a a person with her Stave it hits for 400,000 Joules. Once spent this move has a 5 minute cooldown before she may use it again.

 * Cosmic Cannon

 * Supernova

 * Shooting Star Barrage 200 joules

  * Rayleigh raises her Stave above her heads. Summoning thousands upon thousands of motes of light. This process takes 3 minutes. When the process ends she points in the direction of a 30 foot radius space. The shooting stars crash down into the areas for 10 seconds. Hitting eat 2 inch squar with a 400 joules projectile of the size of a marble. This happens in slightly random instance, averaging about 10 strikes per second for the duration of the attack.

**Enhanced Physicals**

 * Rayleigh is able to process light in far greater detail than normal humans. She is able to see in both infrared and ultraviolet and see 15 times further than a normal human.

 * Daniel does not require sleep. Even in his normal human form.

Tinker/Blaster

They have a magical girl aesthetic. Their main invention is a large Stave/Gun hybrid and a Tiara that reads her brain waves. They are able to fire layers and manipulate a hard light like form of solid energy. By switching to different modes they can fire laser blasts, for orbs of energy that explode on contact when hitting this, create a flying razor sharp like of energy when swiped, form a bubble shield, rapid fire small blasts.

The gun also has a strong charge up mechanic. Allowing them to far exceed their normal energy output for short instances.

Alt-Clockblocker

Power cannot be used on themsleves. Only their cloths and such.

The power can go on indefinitely and be turned off at will. Thoigh it only stays active if they keep touching the object. Once they loose contact the object unfreezes.

So they can do stuff like freezing their cloths or weapons block attacks. Freezing things attavhed to their hands or feet to climp in mid air. Knocking one person out of the fight consistently until they are full contained, but being stuck near them.

Any creature that physically touches any of Bloodbaths blood, as long as it is in liquid form, is sent into a blind rage. Violently attacking the other creatures around them. The exception is that those under the effect of Bloodbath deliberately avoid hurting him. In addition they seem to have a bias towards harming people he sees in a negative light. 

Bloodbath has no superhuman ability to spread his blood around. Instead he has to go out of her way to have blood drawn and store it into containers. His favorite method is to have it turned into capsules her can fire from a special paint ball gun.

**Bloodpuppet**(couldnt think of anything better) -  Blaster/Master

A vigilante from the northeast united states Bloodpuppet focusses on taking don villains with a lot of henchman. Attacking a single one and they using them to capture more henchmen. Until they have an army large enough to take down the main boss.

Bloodpuppet can use a small portion of her blood and expand them into large projectiles of the liquid. He can fire the orb at high speeds. When it hits a creature or objects splatters over them, although remaining more solid than it should be. Over a couple seconds the blood quickly harder in substance more durable than stone. At first her blood is just used to trap enemies and restricts their movement.

Her true power develope when she manages to completely cover a person in blood. When this happens the blood condences into a form fitting layer of armor over them. Bloodpuppet can control these suits of armor while using her victim as a host. The suites can take multiple bullets before breaking and hit several times harder than a human being."

**Blood Constructs**

When wounded in areas Jeremy is able to manipulate his blood for a short time to create semi solid constructs of blood and weapons. When he gives up a blood construct to make something new it turns back to a liquid and splatters to the ground around him.

He has a hard limit on how much energy he can put into his blood constructs at any given moment. This is represented as Blood Points. Each of his techniques uses up a certain amount of his blood points at a time. Once a constructs is made the points it cost become unavailable, and then the contrasts is given up he regains use of those point.

Currently Sickle Cell has *20 Blood Points* to use.

**Contact Portals**

 * When X or anything they are currently holding touches a solid surface X can instantly create a portal linking to another portal on a solid surface within their range. These portals can only be placed on flat/semi flat surface but this does not need to be totally flat. Thinks such a windows, popcorn walls, asphalt, or brick walls are all fine 

 * Portals start off only large around to fit the object going through but will grow larger to accommodate an items with an irregular shape. Portals cap at a max of 8 feet wide.

 * Portals only start an instant before the object goes through them. When the object leaves the portal it stay for 1 second unless a new object enters. The except is that at any time C can leave 1 pair of portals stable. Allowing them to stay open indefinitely, until she decides to close them.

 * If the surface a portal is on is destroyed or damaged in a way that causes it to not longer be at least  a semi flat surface that the portal closes. Anything cause within the portal is shunted out whichever said had not of its mass and pushed to the nearest available space. Stopping any instance of telefragging.
