When I get home, I throw Vegan mozz on it and pop it in the hot oven for 5 minutes. I did this for my Super Bowl party. Some people didn’t even notice the difference."
golf,fgj7ms5,t1_fgipts1,1580838548.0,"Yes. I meant PGA Tour. The PGA is the association of club pros. The PGA Tour is the business of the events. And the USGA is the people that govern the rules of golf in the US and they control the US Open. 

So, when the Tour goes to a TPC, the tour pays itself?   Also, is the US Open a PGA Tour event or just a USGA event 

Lastly, the Player’s Championship, is that the PGA Tour’s Championship? Or is the FEDEX the Tour’s Championship?"

I’m not saying you’re going to be a UN translator negotiating key diplomatic agreements.  But maybe you can pick up some conversational knowledge of another language.  It can hurt."

LifeProTips,fgahm1i,t1_fgaglc7,1580651375.0,You are so right. I’m pretty fluent in another language and I use this technique to stay sharp and also to trick myself into thinking I’m not just wasting time watching “Rounders” for the 20th time.  The really good dubs try to incorporate an equivalent pun or idiom.  I found the “Morning Show” dub in Italian was actually well done.  Another think that annoys me is when they use the English name instead instead of a substitute. It makes the translation sound bad. Like “Jack” instead of “Gianni” for example. But I’m nitpicking.

vegan,ffv2081,t3_euygdv,1580253851.0,Update: went to another BK and they DID honor the 2 for $6. No up charge. Great deal. You can’t buy the Impossible meat and make it yourself for less.
vegan,ffu8ipo,t1_fftfbh9,1580236724.0,"I do. With no mayo, of course. I don’t speak for the vegan community in any way. I was off of red meat for all of 2019 and vegan since October 2019.  I think products like this are crucial to more acceptance of a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle by more people and should therefore be supported.  Purists will probably say I’m not a vegan. I still own leather, for instance.  But I am, certainly, not eating any animals or animal products. So physiologically I’m vegan, but maybe not completely philosophically a vegan yet.  I did it for health reasons anyway. I think there’s many people like me and that’s a very good thing for the whole movement away from animals. As these fake products become cheaper, real meat will have to become more expensive thereby making more people switch. The last real meat hamburger in history will be auctioned off for $150K or more (some day). 

By the way, these “fake meat” companies are testing on us, humans, too.  And maybe since these products are in the market there’s less testing on animals going on. I don’t know. No one can be sure there will be no long lasting issues with these products. 

Lastly, the fake meats, for me, are a transitionary “crutch”.  More and more, I’m losing the “taste” for these products as my body is “forgetting” about meat. I don’t crave meat anymore and I’m craving the fake stuff less and less. Another interesting and helpful development.  

Thanks for asking."
