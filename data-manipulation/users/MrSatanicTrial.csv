relationship_advice,ffbkys1,t1_ffbkvkg,1579770359.0, Why don’t you go do something nice for yourself instead of spreading your pain around on the internet.
relationship_advice,ffbkpnq,t1_ffbkfe3,1579769972.0,Imean you can say whatever you want but you can’t help a victim of abuse by bullying them
relationship_advice,ffbkkrp,t1_ffbkcb0,1579769768.0,Ego doesn’t necessarily mean narcissism- it’s that your ability to empathize is compromised when you’ve fixate so much on your own pain

relationship_advice,ffbk7pk,t3_esq8dw,1579769244.0,You aren’t a safe person for her to be around in her grief because you’re currently totally preoccupied with your own ego. You need to do some personal growth work and find ways of managing your anxiety on your own if you want healthy relationships going forward.
relationship_advice,ffbjinc,t3_esq8vw,1579768259.0,"Stop waiting for him to get help and go get some help for yourself. I’m not saying drop him instantly (although I would), but if you really want to alter this relationship and your partner is unwilling it’s time to get perspective from a professional."
relationships,ffbivsn,t3_espxxf,1579767379.0,"It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now. You’d probably benefit more from sharing these feelings with a mental health professional, and that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you- feeling overwhelmed is human. Arranging therapy can be a stressful process, especially when you aren’t feeling well, but you have to decide for yourself if it’s a priority, and maybe enlist a trusted person if it’s too complicated on your own."

relationships,ffbhpzn,t3_espt35,1579765819.0,"If you’re asking for someone’s number before establishing any kind of chemistry or personal connection- it’s not going to work. If there’s clearly flirting and reciprocated interest, yes they will probably respond positively."
relationships,ffbhacz,t3_espqhi,1579765256.0,"Your bf isn’t ready to get married. It’s understandable you’d be disappointed that your excitement isn’t mutual, but pressuring your partner to make a lifelong commitment they aren’t certain about isn’t how healthy marriages are made."

SuicideWatch,ffapest,t1_ffaopex,1579741386.0,You’re also turning people of marginalized experience off and away from seeking help and solidarity. I don’t know your parameters for determining what’s activism and what isn’t (since again- this is an activist sub) but silencing people who are in pain is no way to help them.
SuicideWatch,ffaohvr,t1_f9vz3p9,1579740773.0,"Probably just as well, these mods have no idea what they’re doing."
SuicideWatch,ffao41c,t3_d2370x,1579740511.0,"You may as well shut down this sub if that’s your intent. The very work people are doing on this site is a form of activism because suicide is a political issue. Marginalized people and communities are more susceptible to depression and have less access to treatment, and are disproportionately affected by suicide. If you’re telling suicidal people they can’t advocate for themselves or one another on this sub how do you expect it to help anyone?"

Fighting,fdplzdy,t3_ec6dj8,1578632380.0,Does she know you’re planning this retaliation on her behalf? Did you bother to ask for professional help before planning an assault? Do you even care that you’re bringing more violence into the life of someone dealing with a rape- in the most misguided and damaging attempt to support her?
AskReddit,fdge905,t1_fdf5tcf,1578392652.0,That’s precious- but doesn’t account for the enormous profit our prison industrial complex was instituted to generate.
