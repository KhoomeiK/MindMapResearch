Similar to the way in which the Star Wars series only has Rogue One, Episodes 4,5, and possibly Episode 3 if you catch me on a good day."

Riding in bad weather is also something you should not feel obliged to do. For one thing, you have to clean the crap out of your bike, especially the chain, after your ride or else it’ll rust overnight."
rugbyunion,ff1h2r0,t1_ff04kru,1579479113.0,"Thompson-sama

This would be a very polite way to address someone. Shop staff often add it on to customers' names.


Thompson-san

The usual way you would address pretty much anyone. Family name plus 'San'. Neighbours, co-workers, highschool classmates sometimes.


A bit more intimate would be Luke-san.


Then friends, family members , etc could address him as follows.
Luke-kun or a nickname like Tomo-kun, etc

Generally -kun is for males, and -chan is for females, but not exclusively. In work situations, younger members -kun is used quite often, regardless of gender."

I have one long sleeved Puro jersey in XL, and several other long sleeved Castelli jerseys and jackets in XXL. Honestly if I were in proper shape, XL would be great.

I got to know them and once saw their targeted attendance for an upcoming game at Kobe Stadium (the sweaty AF one from the World Cup). It was 3,000 people.

I had similar problems with hand and elbow pain so after a couple of years I changed from a 100mm to a 70mm stem, which helped a lot. Id already played around with saddle position, moving it as far forward as I could. 

A year or so later though I ended up buying a more relaxed geometry bike and that has solved the problem. I didn’t get a bike fit, just watched Vids and read articles about it.
I still ride and really like my first roadbike though. It is so alive. 
As for the steering difference, I didn’t feel sharper steering to be a problem, in fact it impressed me, especially on a big, twisty, local descent."

I had a wonderful time getting off at random stops in Tokyo and just seeing where I'd end up. Saw all kinds of stuff. It made me really good with the subway routes and kanji for place names in Tokyo, too (for a while).
