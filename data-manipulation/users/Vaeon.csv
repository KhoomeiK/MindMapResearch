TIFU by not monitoring my cat's internet access.

Okay, obligatory this didn't happen \*today\* but a couple weeks ago.  Little backstory, I have 2 cats that I've raised from kittens on a strict vegan diet.  I left my calico Zelly alone in the living room while I took my tabby Vrrbz to bathe him.

When I came back for her I saw she was surfing the web which she knows she's not supposed to do unsupervised, but I was a little distracted so I didn't make an issue of it.

That night I took my GF out to see a movie and when we got back we found Zelly had prepared a rack of lamb recipe she had found on Paula Deen's website.

So now I lock my screen every time I leave my cats alone.

TLDR; my vegan cat discovered the lure of animal flesh due to my negligence."
