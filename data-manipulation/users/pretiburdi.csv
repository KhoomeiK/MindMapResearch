I had fun using my own town and country and world but it definitely is a lot of work. If it's for a short campaign, why not use a setting from a favorite story of yours? Strumlots college from BomBARDed, or the Moon Base from TAZ, or something like that?

Edit: I didn't read your post carefully enough. But I still think you should go through past stories, movies, tv and think of similar storylines (can't think of one right now) and see why that setting fit ?"

AskReddit,ffjmrfy,t3_etzuh5,1580001845.0,My family and I used to hide a fake cockroach around the house and my sister hid it in the shower once. This normally wouldn't have been so bad but I shower without my glasses or contacts and I freaked out xD

college,ffib0rt,t3_etsqs5,1579969585.0,"Agreed. Colleges also like to see how well rounded you are aka outside things like work and clubs. 
Think of yourself as an asset and college is a big business (it is unfortunately). Are you doing things in a way that the college could use you to tell other people to go there?? Then you're probably good, haha.

Sidenote - and not because of your grades but in general, check out state schools. They're cheaper and not necessarily better or worse because your education is the effort you put into it. You could go to the shittiest college and come out on top because you did the work etc.

Good luck!!"

starbucksbaristas,ffhbeh2,t3_etmani,1579928772.0,"I think it's time to tell this binch that the computer wont do the thing. You can't fix the machine to 190°, you can only do the best you can, and if she doesn't like her she can get a different drink or go elsewhere. I don't like the bringing in own thermometer thing. I don't like that at all :-/"
college,ffe01eo,t3_et3vb1,1579833204.0,"I worked during college, on the weekends. It worked out fine since I lived at home and commutes as well. Starbucks is a good job since they typically have flexible hours, but see if you can ask an employee how they like it beforehand because just like most chain stores, and any place of work really, the energy of the store matters a lot. I love my bux I work at but I'd never survive at others, haha. 

You can try tutoring at your old middle school or at the library too! I tutor Spanish now and it usually pays well and is also fairly flexible. I graduated 2013 so it's been a while but if you have any more questions lemme know!"

college,ffasbqs,t3_esffqp,1579743343.0,"I graduated college some years ago and the people I still hang out with from college surprise me. I assumed my first friend I made who was in all my classes would be my forever friend, but it ended up being a girl I met in Jr year, we hung out a bit then lost track for a year or two, then randomly met up for an arcade trip and now she's one of my besties.
Don't worry too much about the future of friendships, because people will surprise you, one way or another. Be yourself, be kind, and listen as much as you speak and you will certainly find some good friends! I also made great friends at jobs, people who I've known for nearly a decade now! Good luck!"

Adulting,ffarzw1,t3_eslk9r,1579743122.0,"Bookstores have an education section (usually for children, don't be offended) but it gives you handwriting lessons and practice, usually K or Pre-K. These will better instruct you on where to start and end your letters! In my education courses we had to practice our handwriting so that we could teach children the proper way to write letters. Good luck!! 
Staples had little booklets of papers with the lines on it too. If you're embarrassed just say it's for education classes in college or say it's for your niece/nephew etc lol."
