you can just download goal tracking apps like Raise the Bar - it's basically an EXP bar that gets EXP when you make progress, it's as visual as it gets.

On another note, I am starting a MasterMind group for people who are SERIOUS about changing their lives, however it is a MUST to COMMIT to attend a weekly meeting and thus not befitting of everyone.

on the other hand, if you are willing to commit, you will gain the ENORMOUS benefits that a MasterMind group gives you such as social support, and peer support which are one of the biggest factors for goal achievement or habit creation.

IF YOU CAN'T COMMIT, DON'T PM ME,

however, if you ARE, I'll see you AT THE TOP !"

pessimism is a natural phenomenon which means it's our nature - "" nature abhors void, therefore it will always seek to fill it up"" 

and since we are often hearing bad things on the news and most people complaining about everything - the default is to think negatively.

We can tell you about tons of different ways to change your habits and it won't stick, that's why I am here to offer you a solution that works - join a MasterMind group which I am creating that will meet once a week, empowering each other to each achieve their own goals in life, as it has shown that social support is one of the major determining factors in whether someone sticks to ANY habits, or they don't.

&#x200B;

it ISN'T FOR EVERYONE, so if you don't think you can COMMIT to meeting once a week and be a supportive member of the group, DO NOT PM ME.  


Otherwise, I'll see you AT THE TOP"

I am glad to see that you have taken your life into your hands and under your responsibility and are willing to change it instead of keep on dwelling on it.

It seems your problem is that you are lacking motivation because of lack of support, you are not lazy but rather don't find it important enough or just don't feel like your actions have an impact. that's where I am as well, although after quite a few months of learning French and Programming and starting my own business.

Therefore, if you are willing to commit, I am opening a MasterMind group for success - people who want to improve their lives - however it DOESN'T FIT EVERYONE, so don't PM me if you're just going to go back to your old ways....

otherwise, I'll see you soon AT THE TOP"

motivation,ff2tlr0,t3_er4yuc,1579523631.0,"Ok you know what is wrong with this quote ?   
it is literally wrong sentence formation at it's core, and even worse - it is misleading 100%

let me explain in the basics and then dive deeper :

first of all ""I believe Social media is responsible for almost everybody's failure in life"" - so far so great, social media has an impact that ruins your life 

second ""The majority of people would ***rather*** watch other people's lives instead of live and develop their own."" - Ok so this sentence is just 99% percent correct,**but !** because you have put the word ""rather"" you have made it totally **incorrect** and **misleading** ! 

why ? because while ""social media is responsible"" is putting the responsibility on social media, ""rather"" is a word used to describe a ***Choice !*** thus creating an illogical sentence, because you can't say : social media is responisble for your failure, **and** you choose to look at other people's lives, therefore it's not your fault that you fail.

Honestly I'm sure most people lost me by now, but if you haven't you're probably the 1% who can actually think for themselves through all this BS around you, and that is who this comment is meant for anyway, the rest ... they'll stay the same blaming social media for choices that **they themselves make**."

French,fekw4bm,t3_epn4ot,1579208822.0,"OK so obviously there is no 1 solution and people go about learning differently as they have different goals, however for me who has started to learn in order to speak and read French mainly,I have started like this :

**1-2 months** \- load up on as much vocabulary as you can. I did that by watching let's play of Enslaved;odyssey to the west in French with subtitles (will add a link soon)

[Link to Enslaved by Nyo Bonus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6LgTcqGQBQ&t=1s) (Please note that he has a playlist of the game, but the playlist has just 6 videos, but actually there is another video (no.7) if you will look through his uploads, it's pretty easy to find.)

 and taking down notes of EVERY word and translating it then adding it to Anki app to review. This has got me around 600 words in a month's time and gave me quite a base to learn French from.

**Month 3** \- Figure out WHY you learn (is it for job,relationship,movies,games etc...) And focus on the skills you'll need to achieve your goal.(reading,writing,listening or talking)

For me as I said its about speaking and reading, which are output skills, so I focus on this using apps that make me write the language and speak it such as :

 NextLingua(from the start),Memrise(new to it but pretty cool),

 Le Bon Mot Francais(my newest hidden gem, has dialogue spoken by REAL people rather than google's voices) 

and Apprendre which does what everyone dreamt of - it takes real French TV shows, music clips and other media and asks you questions to see if you understand it well enough(best by far if quite time-demanding)

**Month 4** \- Present I am at quite a good level but as I've said I want to focus on speaking too, so apps are nice but aren't real conversations,and I couldn't get into the iTalki or other language exchange apps as it feels too weird for me ATM,

 so I took matters to my own hands and created a Facebook group for locals in my city who speak French in order to practice the local language and vice versa. So basically I'm creating a community in order to improve my French, now obviously you don't have to do that far, but get creative with that and you will make it.

If you'll notice,I've gone through a lot of things, and I've only given you the successes, but this is after sorting the useless stuff out, so be sure to get ready,because not every method you will find will be perfect on your first shot.

Well, if you convinced yourself, that means there's some use to you in believing that, as I believe the same way that those things are useless, and ever since I've accepted it, my loneliness is not there anymore. because loneliness or **any mental illness** for that matter is just cognitive dissonance.

what is **cognitive dissonance?** I'm no doctor but in my simple understanding it's when what you want, and what you have are not in allignment, for example - you want to be social but you don't have friends, that creates loneliness. however by not wanting that social aspect, having no friends is no longer loneliness. I hope that makes sense.

I am able to open up socially to people just enough that when we're in a setting that forces them to interact with me (ex. Job,School,Class...) then I can show  them I'm quite nice to be around with, however on a random event such as walking down a street or a bar or a party... I won't open up my mouth and would feel terrible for having gone out of the house in the first place.

I wish I could have told you what to do, but I'm in the same place you are, or even worse... as I'm not willing to become socially adept, I like this loneliness even if it's a bit harder at times than having a support system, but a good quote I've seen on the subject that might hit you hard (you have been warned !!! ) is this : **No matter where you go, you take yourself with you.**

I actually felt the same way as you before, I used to be on an online website where people would ask questions and vent and I'd usually strike up conversations with the most broken of souls, as I don't know how to make people open up to me in real life this fast(too long to explain here)

anyways, I'd end up talking to strangers online on a daily basis, taking care of them and making sure they didn't fell down this dark tunnel which very few get out of at the end. 

I have also got back to this site and had a girl hit me up again saying how I've made a huge change and helped her life that way just by listening to her on a daily basis when she needed it and no one else was there for her.

However, somewhere along the line I've changed(for the worse you could say) and realized that I needed to take care of myself First as all this taking care of others thing did was making me avoid dealing with **my own** problems.

granted, I have turned out to **only** care about myself since then and as some would say it's better, I feel I have become a ""normal"" person - which I consider to be heartless....

so yeah, that's the other side of the coin, so if you're feeling that sense of being a **good person** by helping and listening to others by the cost of neglecting **your self care** then keep doing that, especially if you're unwilling to become like me (I hate myself) and become heartless to anyone in pain.  


My only consolidation is that I am an extremist, and this has shown true throughout my life

I'll explain - I would usually go to 1 extreme, and then to the other, because only that way I am later able to find the middle between them. 

so now I understand that I need to Master taking care of **myself** before finding the balance of taking care of both **myself and others.**

&#x200B;

I hope I didn't go out of topic too much, please reply to tell me what you think/ or more importantly how you feel about that ...waiting for input ....."

it is literally wrong sentence formation at it's core, and even worse - it is misleading 100%

let me explain in the basics and then dive deeper :

first of all ""I believe Social media is responsible for almost everybody's failure in life"" - so far so great, social media has an impact that ruins your life 

second ""The majority of people would ***rather*** watch other people's lives instead of live and develop their own."" - Ok so this sentence is just 99% percent correct,**but !** because you have put the word ""rather"" you have made it totally **incorrect** and **misleading** ! 

why ? because while ""social media is responsible"" is putting the responsibility on social media, ""rather"" is a word used to describe a ***Choice !*** thus creating an illogical sentence, because you can't say : social media is responisble for your failure, **and** you choose to look at other people's lives, therefore it's not your fault that you fail.

Honestly I'm sure most people lost me by now, but if you haven't you're probably the 1% who can actually think for themselves through all this BS around you, and that is who this comment is meant for anyway, the rest ... they'll stay the same blaming social media for choices that **they themselves make**."

French,fekw4bm,t3_epn4ot,1579208822.0,"OK so obviously there is no 1 solution and people go about learning differently as they have different goals, however for me who has started to learn in order to speak and read French mainly,I have started like this :

**1-2 months** \- load up on as much vocabulary as you can. I did that by watching let's play of Enslaved;odyssey to the west in French with subtitles (will add a link soon)

[Link to Enslaved by Nyo Bonus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6LgTcqGQBQ&t=1s) (Please note that he has a playlist of the game, but the playlist has just 6 videos, but actually there is another video (no.7) if you will look through his uploads, it's pretty easy to find.)

 and taking down notes of EVERY word and translating it then adding it to Anki app to review. This has got me around 600 words in a month's time and gave me quite a base to learn French from.

**Month 3** \- Figure out WHY you learn (is it for job,relationship,movies,games etc...) And focus on the skills you'll need to achieve your goal.(reading,writing,listening or talking)

For me as I said its about speaking and reading, which are output skills, so I focus on this using apps that make me write the language and speak it such as :

 NextLingua(from the start),Memrise(new to it but pretty cool),

 Le Bon Mot Francais(my newest hidden gem, has dialogue spoken by REAL people rather than google's voices) 

and Apprendre which does what everyone dreamt of - it takes real French TV shows, music clips and other media and asks you questions to see if you understand it well enough(best by far if quite time-demanding)

**Month 4** \- Present I am at quite a good level but as I've said I want to focus on speaking too, so apps are nice but aren't real conversations,and I couldn't get into the iTalki or other language exchange apps as it feels too weird for me ATM,

 so I took matters to my own hands and created a Facebook group for locals in my city who speak French in order to practice the local language and vice versa. So basically I'm creating a community in order to improve my French, now obviously you don't have to do that far, but get creative with that and you will make it.

If you'll notice,I've gone through a lot of things, and I've only given you the successes, but this is after sorting the useless stuff out, so be sure to get ready,because not every method you will find will be perfect on your first shot.

the guy says : well I'll probably live to be 100, but what a way to live ?

>Right ! what a way to live ? safe and secure ?   
that's why I say it's better to live 30 years full of adventures than 100 years safe.... in the corner.....

Well, if you convinced yourself, that means there's some use to you in believing that, as I believe the same way that those things are useless, and ever since I've accepted it, my loneliness is not there anymore. because loneliness or **any mental illness** for that matter is just cognitive dissonance.

what is **cognitive dissonance?** I'm no doctor but in my simple understanding it's when what you want, and what you have are not in allignment, for example - you want to be social but you don't have friends, that creates loneliness. however by not wanting that social aspect, having no friends is no longer loneliness. I hope that makes sense.

that doesn't seem like you've convinced yourself, so maybe you lied to yourself, because as you can see above I feel truly good about it, but if you feel bad about it... then better check again if you **really** want to be away from all of ""this""

I am sorry to tell you this but ...it doesn't matter where you will go, things unfortunately won't change unless you change inside, I am talking about this from experience of changing tons of jobs, moving to a number of different cities and yet feeling empty in every place I've been to. 

I am able to open up socially to people just enough that when we're in a setting that forces them to interact with me (ex. Job,School,Class...) then I can show  them I'm quite nice to be around with, however on a random event such as walking down a street or a bar or a party... I won't open up my mouth and would feel terrible for having gone out of the house in the first place.

I wish I could have told you what to do, but I'm in the same place you are, or even worse... as I'm not willing to become socially adept, I like this loneliness even if it's a bit harder at times than having a support system, but a good quote I've seen on the subject that might hit you hard (you have been warned !!! ) is this : **No matter where you go, you take yourself with you.**

I actually felt the same way as you before, I used to be on an online website where people would ask questions and vent and I'd usually strike up conversations with the most broken of souls, as I don't know how to make people open up to me in real life this fast(too long to explain here)

anyways, I'd end up talking to strangers online on a daily basis, taking care of them and making sure they didn't fell down this dark tunnel which very few get out of at the end. 

I have also got back to this site and had a girl hit me up again saying how I've made a huge change and helped her life that way just by listening to her on a daily basis when she needed it and no one else was there for her.

However, somewhere along the line I've changed(for the worse you could say) and realized that I needed to take care of myself First as all this taking care of others thing did was making me avoid dealing with **my own** problems.

granted, I have turned out to **only** care about myself since then and as some would say it's better, I feel I have become a ""normal"" person - which I consider to be heartless....

so yeah, that's the other side of the coin, so if you're feeling that sense of being a **good person** by helping and listening to others by the cost of neglecting **your self care** then keep doing that, especially if you're unwilling to become like me (I hate myself) and become heartless to anyone in pain.  


My only consolidation is that I am an extremist, and this has shown true throughout my life

I'll explain - I would usually go to 1 extreme, and then to the other, because only that way I am later able to find the middle between them. 

so now I understand that I need to Master taking care of **myself** before finding the balance of taking care of both **myself and others.**

***There's a TL;DR below if you're looking for the best points in 1 minute***

I will share with you MY method, and see if you would find any additions to your already great method :

I'll start by saying I didn't know how to start so I stumbled around for about a few weeks before setting on actually learning... with that out of the way, let's start :

I have watched a let's play series of a video game I've played a few times by a French youtuber and literally translated every word in the game's movie and added it into an Excel file vocabulary(which I never actually refrenced so...) 600 words of vocabulary here.

then I've had a few apps, mostly Drops which helped increase my vocabulary by another 200 words.

then I've actually started using Anki for a few months (1-2) and that helped me increase my remembering and using of vocabulary immensely, and after quitting I just recently got back to Anki after a long break as I've stopped adding words regularly(bad move, with Anki you want to always add words on a daily basis as at some points the words you've reviewed will only come up once every 3 months, so you'll not have anything to review for that time and lose motivation)

after that I've tried(and failed) to watch TV series in french but my level was too low for that even with subtitles on so I stopped that.

after that I don't actually remember much learning, just fell into a slump for about a month doing routine apps (""Mondly,NextLingua,Memrise"") before taking a trip to France.

my trip to France showed me how low my level was while also showing me how much I already knew, which renewed my motivation.

so when I got back I signed up for a course and started learning seriously, and so we are today.

2 days ago I've created a plan looking at where my biggest shortcomings and goals are intersecting and found out I need to add at least 1,000 words to my vocabulary in order to understand most texts in french, AND to be conversationally fluent I need to actually use the language on a daily basis, so I joined a french speaking Discord channel to practice my speaking as there's not much french people I know in my town.

**TL;DR** \- basically I went through a lot of apps and trials,**what worked =**\- Apps(""Drops,NextLingua,Anki"")- regularly add new words to Anki- Evaluate your speech level to maintain motivation- Evaluate your weak spots(vocabulary,grammar, etc...)- Evaluate your goals(Speaking,Writing,Reading....)- Join a French community(I suggest Discord)

**what didn't work =**

\- Adding words to a vocabulary you never review- Never Evaluating your progress- Watch TV above your level (stick to children books..suggestion : [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmfepkcaQlMEwyIsbUs63g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmfepkcaQlMEwyIsbUs63g) \- BookBox on YT - books in french for kids[https://www.youtube.com/user/ComptinesTVfr](https://www.youtube.com/user/ComptinesTVfr) \- Les Patapons on YT - songs in french for kids)please let me know what you think, and mention me if it's possible so I know you've replied \^\_\^"

I wanted to do the same as them not too long ago, and all I ever wanted was someone to **show** me they care by getting through all the walls and nasty harsh words I threw at them, no one did so I did it for myself, but maybe this friend might not take the same road as me...you know what I mean so I guess it'd be best to go at their house, give them a hug and keep them company even if they don't ""want"" you to be there, trust me, they **NEED** you to be there."
Vent,fc1tjzj,t3_efpnos,1577329269.0,"WOW. I get you bro, I feel the same way every time I see people having fun and wonder why I can't be like them, in fact I thought about it today and about how people can have such an easy time socializing and have fun and why is it so hard for me.

&#x200B;

but I've come to realize that maybe there's nothing wrong with me, and it just means that I don't need to rely on other people to be happy,and perhaps rely on myself to create those special moments which make life feel good again.

&#x200B;

so what I suggest is you choose what kind of approach you want to take life, being controlled by others to be happy, or take things to your own hands and even though the latter is tougher...it gives you much more freedom and happiness in the long term (from experience :))"
