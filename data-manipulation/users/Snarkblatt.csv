My 8 year old dug through the pile of games and picked out WoS and we spent the rest of the weekend playing and collecting swords. This was the first game he's played where you could use just straight up cheat codes too, still had the piece of notebook paper folded up in the case from however many years since it's been last last played."

WTF,feniuc6,t1_fendfkg,1579285626.0,"Nah, they make things called beer bongs that are basically a rubber sleeve with a small hose in it. You put the sleeve over the opening of a bottle, the tube goes to the bottom, when you flip it upside down the hose allows air to enter as the liquid comes out. It basically prevents the vacuum effect of air trying to get in as the liquid goes out, so the bottle will drain in seconds. Basically let's you ""shotgun"" bottles."
