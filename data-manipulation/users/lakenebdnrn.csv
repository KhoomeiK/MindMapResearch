UniversityOfHouston,ff7v97g,t3_es1wky,1579659172.0,Ughh omg! This girl came up to me on campus and asked if I believed in God. Then she asked me to join her bible study. She seemed nice and I just wanted the whole thing to be over so I (very stupidly) gave her my number. No texts yet but I'll just block and let other people know.  Now that I know it's a cult I'm definitely gonna troll a little bit when they text me.
UniversityOfHouston,fenczxz,t3_epw7g6,1579282051.0,"Yes and i have no issues. My name is on the lease and it's technically my apartment. My boyfriend lives with me and all the employees, management etc know him. We just switch months on paying rent, it doesn't matter who's name it's under as long as it's payed to your apartment."
glossier,fdzx2ty,t1_fdzwcb5,1578797897.0,They won't. They ignored the initial situation and told us to handle it on our own. The best thing to do now is to do all trades/sales through a website (depop etc) so the buyer is protected.
physicianassistant,fduebkl,t1_fdthhkh,1578731815.0,"Thank you! I thought i had submitted there but I obviously didn't, mistake on my part."
glossier,fdau46r,t3_ekgy5j,1578250186.0,When I move to my next apartment and hopefully have some more bathroom space for my skincare/makeup I'm going to hang it on the wall!
UniversityOfHouston,fd7anb4,t3_ek6x9v,1578201636.0,"RA on call will open the door for you. However, half the time I've called them they haven't answered. If that doesn't work you can try finding a security guard walking around. 

Once I literally called the emergency line cause someone broke into my apartment and literally no one answered lol."
fatlogic,fd5an8r,t3_ek2pra,1578175772.0,"At the end they say that they eat at night (binging). So.. do the calories not count? I'm not understanding their logic. Yes, they are gaining weight because they literally admitted to binging and eating a lot. But then they deny it..?"
glossier,fd51cvy,t1_fd4ixyf,1578173241.0,Their customer service definitely keeps me coming back. If something goes wrong I always know that they will help me out. It's a great way to keep customers!
fatlogic,fcpjajf,t3_eie6d7,1577865641.0,I'm sure they would praise people for posting weight gain progress pics while shunning those who post weight loss pics.
fatlogic,fcosmnw,t1_fcoqnk1,1577840447.0,"Haha you're right. These people are either in two boats:

1) My friend eats sooo much and he's thin! That's proof that some people are just born thin- they can eat 5000 calories daily and never gain a pound!

2) You're starving yourself and depriving yourself of food. I'm sure every moment of your existence is spent thinking about the burgers you wish you could eat. Let me enlighten you!

Of course we must not speak about 3, which is: You eat enough to maintain your weight, and you probably exercise."
fatlogic,fcok9u7,t3_eiab47,1577834353.0,"""The last thing I want to hear about is your diet or exercise routine... pretending you're not dieting when you are dieting is bullshit""

So.. exercising is dieting. Eating the same amount of calories daily is dieting. Sounds like if you're fit or just not overweight this person will assume you're dieting even if you literally *never mention it*. Because your body is an indicator of everything you do, unless you're obese because they work out a ton and eat healthy and obesity is just their natural set point. Duh."
traderjoes,fcmd313,t3_ehxwle,1577771002.0,"Pretty much everything sells out early into the season. For the stuff that doesn't sell they move it near the cash registers so that people are more likely to pick it up. 

Most seasonal items can only be ordered once or twice by the store which is why a lot of things sell out immediately and never reappear that season. For the things that get ordered more than that, they are most likely fan favorite items/best sellers so they are guaranteed to sell."
fatlogic,fclry94,t3_ehv9ht,1577755009.0,So what... should we refer to it as? These people will gladly call out anyone who's underweight (or even a low healthy BMI) but god forbid we address the opposite side of the spectrum.
glossier,fcjbztw,t1_fcjb6ot,1577682570.0,"You can try your bank, but I'm gonna be honest that you most likely won't get it back :( Since it's friends and family (and not purchasing an item) you basically aren't protected by anything."
glossier,fcivg1e,t3_eh7wr3,1577670771.0,"Yep, that's immediately what I thought when I saw them offer two BDC. I think a safer way to buy/sell would be have that person make a listing for it on Depop. That way you're both protected by PayPal buyer and seller insurance. Glad you didn't get scammed! It sucks they're targeting our very trustful sub."
glossier,fc73x6r,t1_fc6vmxt,1577496874.0,The nyx one works great!
fatlogic,fc6dvub,t1_fc65ir1,1577478257.0,"Also, if your abs are ruined by the holidays then you most likely don't have a low body fat %."
fatlogic,fc37wan,t3_efyi04,1577383601.0,"If obesity was solely in inward disease, one that would impact your health but others couldn't see, it wouldn't have an 'acceptance' movement. But since it's very much physical and EVERYONE can see whether or not you're fat, people feel the need to make it a movement. In reality, most people don't care if someone is overweight. I, for one, don't even notice it at this point because it's so prevalent. If someone is mocking you for being overweight then they're probably mocking underweight people too (of course there's no movement for them though). Something that was made to pander to peoples feelings has turned into a huge movement that we literally can't escape."
fatlogic,fc10uv6,t1_fc0mmln,1577305048.0,"Regardless of whether or not anorexia is common in men, the majority of people with eating disorders will never be underweight- and much less significantly so. Most people who restrict also struggle with binging, which keeps them from actually losing weight. These people act like they care about eating disorders when in reality they don't even pay attention to the people who *actually* show symptoms of EDs, like having no restraint with no food.. but I digress lol"
