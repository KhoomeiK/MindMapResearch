Either have them upset with you or have them gone forever too damn young. Police may not work out for some, but fuck it’s worth a shot when you’re trying to save someone."

I know being a close friend you feel like theres a chance you can talk her out of it, and sometimes you absolutely can. But if she’s as serious as you say, and this is gunna hurt, her friends might not be enough. Like another comment said, enjoy the times with her that you do have if you don’t want to go to the authorities... Just keep being supportive and remind her about the good things in life. Maybe suggest she write out her feelings anonymously on reddit or tumblr or some other form of social media. Just be there as much as you can. You’re doing good by reaching out already, which is more than most people can say. 

The only thing that stopped me is the fear of pain itself, which is apparently common. There’s one site I always looked at while bawling my eyes out that almost stopped me. I can link it. If she’s in her worst moments, maybe being real and sending her it might help. Sometimes just reading something about it can slow someone down. [link](https://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods)"
SuicideWatch,fddavoy,t3_ekr9h1,1578303158.0,"It may be hard to do, but you should tell someone about it, if not your parents, then go talk to a mental health professional. If you really seriously think she’s in danger, go to the police. I grew up with a severe narcissist mother who didn’t believe I was depressed and suicidal. I ended up slicing my wrists with a broken mirror and was forced to go to my dance classes that day... family was hard, so I can relate. My boyfriend went through similar depression and he went into the psych ward for awhile in high school, it really helped him. I wish someone had done that for me, no matter how scary it was. 

The best bet as a good friend, is to get the help your friend deserves. And if her parents are treating her that horribly, you can explain it to the cops too. They might not do anything about it, but that’s all your call. Just get her some place safe where she not only has access to mental help, but somewhere away from her family. Call the hospital or the cops and explain the situation, and that you know she is a suicidal risk.

In terms of how you can help her, give her support through this. Explain she isn’t alone, and will never be. You’re always a call away, and you’d do anything to see her face the next day. Be there for her, take her out for walks or to the mall. Be present and show her what little things life has to offer, like watching clouds or people watching. it may seem boring, but it’s grounding to see things that are mundane."
