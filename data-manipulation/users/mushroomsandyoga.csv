Anxiety,fgycq8q,t3_f0txwm,1581181925.0,I’ve been dealing with a lot of nausea and diarrhea lately as I’ve been really anxious for a specific reason. My brother gets really bad nausea and vomiting from anxiety as well.

EDAnonymous,fgy88td,t3_f0pqhu,1581180530.0,This is me as well. Being a healthy weight isn’t worth the mental anguish and being underweight isn’t either. It’s crazy because I finally seem to have gotten my depression under control but nothing I try seems to touch this mess.
