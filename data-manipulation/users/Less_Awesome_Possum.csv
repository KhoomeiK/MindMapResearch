Why do you think MLM’s are so popular?

Most stay at home mom’s don’t stay at home because they don’t want to work either."

My daughter gets 2 huge debilitating colds a year, one at the beginning or winter and one at the beginning of spring so she never gets the bike.  This year she outgrew her bike and really tried to grin and bare it through her cold, and then she woke up with her eyes glued together and barely able to talk and I made her stay home because she needed to rest to get better.  

I bought her a bike for christmas."

Also check to see if there are any certifications you can get to fluff your resume a bit."

unpopularopinion,fencmsq,t3_eq1o41,1579281828.0,"A lot of shelter dogs require a lot more responsibility then getting a puppy from a breeder.  They often already have really bad habits, that require a ton of training to fix.  If you already have other animals or kids not knowing a dogs full history can be deal breaker.  

If people don’t want to deal with the hassle of going through all that they are completely within their right to do so.

Plus, when you buy a full breed dog you can already predict the temperament of the dog to decide if the dog is the right choice."

Still, depending on what career you enter, being a stay at home parent can still provide valuable job experience.  Regardless of what you want to call it."

Consider it  like an unpaid internship then, it’s the experience of a lot of jobs without the pay.  Interns still get to put their internships on a resume without complaint."

Would you also tell an elderly or disabled caretaker that what they do isn’t a real job? Just because I don’t have to leave my house everyday doesn’t mean i’m not constantly working from sun up to sun down. A job is something that teaches you valuable transferrable skills.  

I have to be the cook, the cleaner, the landscaper, the caretaker, the designated receptionist for all appointments and calendar events, I also have to do all the shopping and plan meals accordingly following a budget (that I also had to create to maintain household finances)  
I also don’t get sick days and I take my responsibilities with me on vacation.  

Also,  TV time is actually very minimal.

You also sound very bitter"

I don’t think depression is the issue here for these people. I don’t really understand the love of socialism either because people who live under socialism also have to work a 9-5 and what not to keep the civilization working.  There is no system that doesn’t require a substantial amount of work.  It’s baffling."

depression,fdl5aii,t3_elwq1m,1578517283.0,"As someone who owns a business I have a few tips and 2 routes you can take for a business of this type.  

For your own online store: 

Figure out what your overhead would be, Figure out your profit margins.  Then go from there.  
30% of your profits could put you out of business very quickly.
Businesses arent usually profitable for 3-5 years.  
Equipment isn’t cheap.  
This is the most complicated route but also has the potential to be the most profitable.  


On demand printing:
Utilizing on demand printing Sites like redbubble allow you to design and earn money for your designs and they take care of the printing and shipping.  However you only earn a fraction of the proceeds.  


I think your idea is sweet, idk if you ever heard of the sad ghost club but they have a pretty decent following so this is a concept that can work.  People are always looking for ways to support the people they love by bringing awareness.  You can also hire artists who suffer from these disabilities to create art for the clothes so it can be super authentic and really adds to beauty of the overall idea."
