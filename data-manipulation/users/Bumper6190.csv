A lot more thought goes into a god, than apparently inspires thought that initiates action in accordance with that belief. An atheist gets to say: I told you so, but does not use a god to motivate behaviour. So, it is highly likely that behaviour would change. Most religious do not act in accordance to their beliefs. look at the USA today, they embrace Trump as a religious icon, because, and only because, he allows them to promote religious influence in law. The religious would not change their human behaviour. Religious institutions would be dismantled, and the structure of thought that comes out would finally be irrelevant. Fewer people would be duped by false-prophets. 

We had a bit of a discussion of this prior to your question. Substitute “law” for religion. We discussed how some use the law as a moral compass, and do not act in a certain way because that is what the law prescribes. However, very many of us do not rely on external doctrines (of law or religion) to guide our behaviour. We are self regulating."
