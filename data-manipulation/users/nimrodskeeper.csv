relationship_advice,ff26efm,t3_er81wy,1579495107.0,"I dealt with something simliar recently. There are many avenues of thought but what I found is that it boils down to a few key things:

1. If you get involved it becomes your drama. People can feel like it is the right thing to do but in the end you become wrapped up in everything that goes into this situation.

2. Telling will most likely end the friendship in the long run. I have not heard or witnessed many relationships that stay together after cheating. In addition to that, all those involved ""pick a side"" and friendships are ruined.

3. If these friends mean a lot to you I would focus on getting them to find help from a counselor. Just telling someone lights a fire and if you really want them to be together and happy then the central theme of your conversation meeds to be showing both of them how to move forward.

I hope this helps!"
