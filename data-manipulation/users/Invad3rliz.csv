I fixed the overheating issue, was fine with the ugly.

All told, about 450 bucks total and I had it for 4 years before some guy jumped in front of me and slammed brakes (brakes literally screamed to stop) to get into a parking lot. I don't know why he felt it was so important that both of our cars were wrecked, but he really wanted it to happen. I got *SUPER* lucky a couple witnesses stayed because he did *not* have a 450 dollar car. Lol"

Everywhere I've lived, for example, people usually start around 16, and people who start earlier than that are generally people with really bad home lives and parents who are also constantly drunk so people don't let their kids hang with them. They might try it earlier but not get over the taste and get drunk til they're a bit older and ""everyone is doing it.""

I don't care how much he's beating himself up about it, he did something so incredibly stupid and is 100% at fault, if he is currently trying to sue a company, it should be throw out. Honestly, I would even ask what he was thinking trying to sue someone because of his actions. Are morons trying to make it so we never get to enjoy things in the future? They made it so you can't open windows in hotels because drunk people fell or something like that, and omg the stupid warning labels on so many things.... he did this because he has no common sense.

What do we do about this? Should we make contracts for anyone to look out the window? ""If you're going to use this window, we have terms and conditions and one is that we are not responsible if you drop a child, a baby, a friend, a spouse, an old co-worker, a nun, your highschool sweetheart, a pet, any person or personal property out of the window,"" do we put up signs and have meetings with passengers before we leave port, or do we just bar them shut? If you get motion sickness or food poisoning and need air flow, tough shit, some guy dropped his baby out a window and sued us for it so the law changed. Good luck."

I know a lot of people who have used it to ""escape depression"" and catch themselves in the vicious cycle of being depressed because of and being depressed because they can't handle being without whatever substance they thought was helping them.

I really hope that you get your life to where you aren't struggling, man. I know the struggle, as I used to have issues of my own. I'm a few years out of a substance abuse issue that started when I was really sick/in a ton of constant pain and ended when I finally got help with the root cause (Crohn's and endometriosis).
