I requested it on facebook and he gave me the address. Then I notified him when it shipped. It took paul eiding 7 months to get his signature back."
technology,ffifzbz,t1_ffiast7,1579972962.0,I've found immigrant places are usually cash only.
technology,ffifqov,t1_ffid9r0,1579972796.0,Yes overdraft is a choice if you want it or not. I've never actually known anyone to be denied an account. But I've heard that low credit score is a reason. Some banks have a minimum amount required to be in the account at all times. It's usually a very low number but for the very poor people it can be an issue. It's never because they charge a monthly fee. Every town has 10+ different bank options to pick from
technology,ffia449,t1_ffi8pgd,1579968961.0,If they cant it's usually because of a bad credit score. But mine has been bad in the past and hasn't had an issue so I'm not sure what the cut off for that it.
technology,ffi8bh1,t1_ffi5haw,1579967695.0,Throughout he country it's a mixture depending on the business. By far the majority accept both. Some are card only and some are cash only

Games,ffh8w2d,t3_etb4x8,1579926478.0,"They targeted gamers.  

Gamers.

We’re a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We’ll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture because we find it fun. 

We’ll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats on a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second. 

Many of us have made careers out of these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to later be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We’re already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren’t shy of throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We’ve been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that’s already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they’ve threatened us with. Who take it as a challenge when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can’t is so deeply ingrained from years of big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a real need; a honed reflex. 

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You’re not special, you’re not original, you’re not the first; this is just another boss fight."
