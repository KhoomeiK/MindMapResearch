nottheonion,ffchkft,t1_ffc8wym,1579799614.0,"You know what, it really bothers me that the bank made a public statement about how much money he had in his account. Is that legal? Can my bank just go publishing my balance wherever they feel like? That seems actionable too."
AskReddit,ffbeup9,t1_ffavlwk,1579762257.0,"At my ex's job, the company didn't have money to pay for tags on the work trucks that last year, and literally transferred title and had workers plate the trucks as personal vehicles and insure them. Turned out great when like 8 months later tht company folded, and they ended up with free trucks."

Watches,ffbdza2,t1_ffbc6z9,1579761257.0,"Yeah there are a lot of differences, I should take some side by side pics. I have a cheap Chinese automatic with a bunch of jewels, and it's nice from a glance but tht finishing on the band is absolute crap, you can actually see that the pieces are rolled and cut and the edges are still quite sharp.

I had a Cadisen, and yes it seemed to be better than average. Actually I'd put most AliExpress watches a bit over the $20-30 Kohl's watches, which don't even pretend not to be terrible. I have a pile of them now that I need to get rid of but they're such shit I don't even feel right about donating them."
Watches,ffb0mvq,t1_ffao1pv,1579748867.0,"Yes, I have been flipping fashion watches and the differences I've noticed:

Genuine leather vs synthetic

Solid steel case (and usually bracelet) vs ""solid steel case back"" and a bracelet and case with dissimilar metal that corrodes.

Higher end movement, even the simple 3 hand movements are metal cased and I often see Ronda, Miyota, and other respected fashion-grade movements. The cheaper base metal watches have Hattori plastic-cased movements.

Better finishing on case, and especially on bracelet links. 

Heavier buckle on strap watches.

Watch faces are made very differently, with Fossil being composed of several pieces of metal which fit together via pegs, and the $30 Kohls watches generally having foil printing on a single metal piece 

Genuine Chronograph movements, or at least pretend Chronograph with functioning date and 24h dial. The $30 watches literally have a printed on foil picture of a Chronograph.

Glass composition and thickness. Fossil uses significantly thicker mineral crystal (I see 2-4mm thick and double dome often) where the $30 watches use 1-1.5mm flat glass if you're lucky, and sometimes plastic.

Now, are FOSSIL, MK, Hilfiger, DKNY, Marc Jacobs, etc mere fashion watches? Yeah but they are still solid watches that will take a beating and last a good decade."
Ebay,ffa625d,t3_erae9q,1579728588.0,"I sold a 'lot' of items back in November, buyer filed a dispute with their CC, with the reason ""no refund given"".

This was one of those ""lot of things that would be impossible to verify as a return"" things, but being mindful of eBay's policy I selected ""30 day refund with return"". Still buyer never communicated.

Dumb thing is I was not really breaking even on this lot in the first place. But I couldn't bear to throw it away. 

So, with no communication from buyer, no return, no cancellation or complaint in ebay etc, PayPal informed me that they are taking my $39.51 (item with free shipping) AND they are taking another $20 because ""no refund or credit"" doesn't fall under Seller Protection Policy. Plus, I still paid ebay $4+ for the privilege of this ""sale"". PayPal says they ""will continue to fight on my behalf"".

I have tracking showing delivery within 3 days of sale, ""handed to individual"", but that isn't enough apparently.

I can afford to eat the $64 but it's the principle, and I'm ticked. I have 22 years on eBay and 100% feedback, occasionally a transaction goes slightly sideways but I've never had something like this happen."

It's a fact that temperament is genetically influenced and breeders can select for it. Think about it for a second, if one dog tends to have higher cortisol or adrenaline levels than another, that's obviously going to have an effect on their behavior."
