aww,fgfxxgl,t1_fgfryq8,1580750018.0,"I know someone who just took their pit in for a c section and she had 13 healthy GORGEOUS puppies. They took her in off the streets as well. I had never seen 13 of them born so healthy and it's a joy to watch them with mama in videos they post. I'm glad they have a great home and will be fixed and loved.

Edit: puppy and mama tax here: https://imgur.com/a/vp0zAnZ
All 13 of them don't appear in these photos which were screenshots I was given permission to post but I'll link a pic of all 13 soon guys ;) I was going for the cutest pics. 2 of them are being bottle fed according to my friend who has them, hence the missing two.:)"
science,fg76s3m,t1_fg70lt2,1580585326.0,You sound unhinged. Why don't you stop all consumption if you're so passionate about animals over humans. Remove yourself from damaging more? You sound like those people that want humans to stop procreation and allow ourselves to become extinct. Lol

politics,fg5f40h,t1_fg5ak93,1580525783.0,"The point is, the president is guilty, the GOP acknowledge this, and that they have no plans to vote impartially, they've stonewalled at every turn and crimes were committed left and right with impunity. This isn't about my ""displeasure"". This is about the crumbling of righteous actors. The GOP operated as bad faith actors and therefore the system has been broken. Thisan should not be the president of the United States yet he'll likely be relected based on ACTUAL fake news & if my Fox news watching father is an accurate representation then the people giving him their vote again don't care what he has done as long as they get the win. This is broken, imho. It's disgusting. I don't need to be told what happened, I saw it for myself."

BeautyGuruChatter,fg4391u,t1_ffrnyhz,1580495235.0,You've nailed it.
BeautyGuruChatter,fg435qe,t1_ffru75n,1580495180.0,"Thanks. I obviously didn't convey my point the right way, especially concerning her head injury. I admit I didn't realize the severity of it and that it could affect her behavior but what I'm seeing is more what you're saying, not much that can be attributed to her TBI. She displayed these behaviors prior to it. Thanks for saying what I meant but more effectively."
politics,fg42cau,t1_fg3w95m,1580494694.0,I lived in Blackburn's district for 3 years and am intimately familiar with the brand of cunt she is. There really isn't a better word imo.

It was totally unrealistic in size and the guy was actually super self conscious because he was always way too big and girls always tapped out immediately. So that sucked.

videos,ffel37q,t1_ffecc56,1579852590.0,They didn't mean call while you're already at the hospital lol sorry to laugh but imagining a Karen in a hospital room on her 2nd hour of waiting calling 911 to request a spunky paramedic to come and get her the care she deserves damn it. Lol but seriously he meant calling from home as you normally would just to get an ambulance and paramedics to escort you to the hospital and then fight on your behalf so you get the most care. I don't suggest it unless it's a real emergency obviously. I doubt anyone wants to go to bat for a patient abusing their services and it's illegal anyway.
todayilearned,feuvb0h,t1_feuusqp,1579390329.0,I'm sure they provide regular clothing in those cases and maybe most cases. It's pretty simple. And I've been to jail unfortunately and the uniforms certainly do affect the psyche of a person. Regular clothes would have boosted morale so much.

HumansBeingBros,felz9ps,t1_felyghs,1579234807.0,There are numerous natural burial cemeteries all over the US. Especially because it seems to be the hip thing due to the advantages to the environment I believe.

She has dementia and I was always closest to her. She's almost 80 and so frail and happily confused and this story makes me want to puke. I agree with the throat ripping. I'd kill for her, this guy is sick."
worldnews,fejzg83,t1_fejtk0x,1579189333.0,"Exactly that. You could see the wheels turning in his head and he knew he couldn't say ""shame on me"" So he poorly improvised. At least he caught it lol Trump would have yelled it from the rooftops of Twitter"
HumansBeingBros,fejyaq8,t1_fejqm1a,1579188608.0,You've been misinformed. I suggest checking out ask a mortician on YouTube to educate yourself on natural burials and how they're perfectly legal. Even with just a shroud and no box at all.

TLCsisterwives,fe6i454,t1_fe6c50k,1578891610.0,"She's acted that way since the start
Way before Kody divorced Mary and married her ""for the kids"" Which I'm sure is valid but it's clearly motivated by much more. As in, Robyn is clearly the fave wife and got the man to end a 20 year marriage. Of course she feels and acts superior. I find her to be gross."
