I would drink 2 or so (maybe each night in the first week) then started drinking 1, then eventually I wasn’t even finishing the beer because it didn’t sound good to me. 

I’ve read mixed results on replacing alcohol with NA variants though, some notice more intense cravings. I did not and it satisfied them. 

Aside from that I drink a lot of Powerade zero, zero calorie juices and occasionally diet Mountain Dew. I save these drinks for when I get home as a reward, similar system as I used to do with light beer."

My girlfriend made a really good meal, I washed my truck and played call of duty the rest of the night. It was weird but good nutrition plays a huge role in mental health as far as I’m concerned.

For sleep I started taking melatonin and occasionally Benadryl. It seems to work wonders so far. 

Just keep telling yourself that you’re stronger than the bottle. It’s probably not the best thing, but I’d tell myself “You aren’t a weak little bitch, don’t be a pussy, shut up and go to the gym... blah blah blah” 

It’s definitely a negative way of looking at yourself but it worked for me. I like to treat not drinking as a challenge in terms of my mental strength. 

And when in doubt look in the mirror, make a video of yourself on your phone, talk to yourself, talk to your spouse, talk to anyone. It’s all going to work out and you’re going to make it till tomorrow."

Find something to occupy your mind that you can get lost in. Start a project, walk your dog and listen to your favorite comedian, play some modern warfare or Zelda (worked for me), study for a test. 

Most importantly set small goals. Tell yourself you’ll make it to 3 days, then one week, then two weeks, then one month and so on. 

I’m only 48 days sober but it’s a really good feeling to come home from work and not have drinking in the back of my head. It’s also super fulfilling to know every morning when I wake up that I didn’t give in to any kinds of temptations.

healthyeating,fc806p3,t1_fc7egpz,1577523349.0,"Best thing you can do is eat a small meal with a lot of water or coffee/tea to fill you up quicker. Once your “full” eat your next meal in an hour or two. 

Just do a rough track of calories and don’t eat an entire bag of m&ms to curb your hunger. Have a MEAL ready and try to eat it slowly and enjoy it. 

IF isn’t for everyone, but it can be a good way for your body to use its fat stores for energy rather than food. 

The idea with IF is your cutting out the quantity of food. So people doing 20/4, 18/6 have the tendency to be able to eat whatever they want for dinner. Also just being consistent is the key. Don’t kill yourself when you workout, just go to the gym and *do something* and when you eat, try to eat similar foods for a week or so before you switch it up, it’s kind of bland but we are creatures of habit and I notice that if I am not on a strict schedule I will fall off the wagon quick"

offmychest,fc2pv35,t3_eftlkn,1577370450.0,"I didn’t really understand this until my girlfriend had told me about it. 

I was fat as a kid and started working out around 12-13 years old and always wanted to be those skinny lanky kids with abs growing up in middle school. Never thought being called skinny would ever bother me. I just started getting really lean, got the six pack and never went through the skinny phase to understand it but certainly went through the fat shaming stage as a kid.

Fast forward to dating my girlfriend who was frequently called skinny and many thought it was a compliment when they’d tell her that, she *hated* it, and ended up putting on 20lbs and has never felt more comfortable in her skin. 

Looking at my mom, she is about 5’8”, has larger feet but not fat and she wishes she was my girlfriend’s size (5’2”) because she’s just so “tiny and cute”.

My dad grew up being called “bag a bones” and really hated that term as well. He started lifting weights to get bigger, similar to my situation but in reverse.

I think it’s all relative to your situation, no one should be put to shame over there physical appearance though aside from maybe if you have a booger on your face or have something in your hair. 

All that being said, everyone’s genetics are different, and being too skinny is just as much a health risk as being too fat. If you don’t like how you look then change it, if you like who you are and someone is telling you different just tell them (figuratively) to go to hell."
