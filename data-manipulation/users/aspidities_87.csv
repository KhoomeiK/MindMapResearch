1) Sometimes assistance programs will make folks aware of guide dog program opportunities and/or enroll them. Many visually impaired people work and live independently and can do their own research on service animals, also. 

2) Sometimes insurance covers it, sometimes not. Many times not, actually. To insurance, a guide dog is basically a more expensive cane, and in their eyes you can just make do with a cane, you don’t ‘need’ a dog. This is patently untrue, and many blind people find canes frustratingly limited, dangerous, or even distracting. Dogs are incomparable as helpers for the profoundly blind. The level of independence is incredible compared to a cane. But you try telling most US health insurers that. As a result, guide dogs are usually prohibitively expensive out-of-pocket, as all that time spent training and working them to be an impeccable member of society costs a lot. You’re looking at $30-40,000, on average, for a Guide Dogs of the Blind dog. There are scholarship programs and financial assistance, but, as with anything, need is high and supply is slow to mature. We need way more people willing to train dogs for services and way more insurers willing to pay. 

3) You do get to meet the dogs but they’re picked for your needs. You get matched with a candidate that seems good for your lifestyle, as not every dog trains the same or acts the same, even from the same litter and exact same program. The trainers and staff involved with a guide dog program have the momentous task of assessing each dog and matching them to a person’s needs and they generally do a good job. There is a ‘trial period’, yes, and if the dog is not a good fit, they can be swapped around. However, if the guide dog association is low on available candidates, you may have to wait until the next graduating session for a new dog. Sometimes the wait is very long. It’s an arduous and imperfect process, but when it works and the pair ‘clicks’—it’s worth every step. 

Hope this helps answer your questions! I worked with a GDA (guide dog association) for several years when I lived in the Bay Area and I know the process was tedious and daunting then. Hopefully it may be improving, but basically everything in American insurance makes life harder for even mildly disabled folks, so I’m not optimistic. The dogs themselves are absolute life changers for the people who have them, and I wish more folks could afford that kind of freedom for themselves! It makes their lives so much more accessible and even opens up social worlds that they would normally be closed off from—dog parks, other dog owners, strangers who want to ask questions etc—and for many blind people I knew, that was a world of difference from being relatively ignored or treated with awkward over-kindness."

I know my local guide dogs association films a lot of training so they can zero in on where a dog missed a cue, etc. Film can be super helpful as a training tool for the humans training dogs to see errors or moments where the dog made the right choice. 


It could also be the owner wanting a friend to record his dog being awesome, or general perspective of his day.  I know a few visually impaired folks who have very active social media presences that they wouldn’t otherwise, simply because a friend takes pictures or video for them, and they enjoy hearing comments from people on their looks or how well-trained their service animal is, just like anyone else would."
