If I'm right about what I saw, and if it's like one of those moments when a player kind of finds their groove at the NHL level, it's something really positive to take away from this game.

I mean, this team is SUPPOSED to lose this game, but for almost 55 minutes, they matched the best team in the league. The best team in the league needed the best player of his generation to beat the Kings tonight, and that's not nothing."
