The African grey parrots with the tokens didn’t get any immediate benefit: only very rarely did the bird getting food give any to the bird giving them tokens.

The ending line sort of disappointed me, as yes, the headline sort of suggests they are using teamwork, when it really seems like one is like, ""I have tokens, let's share!"" Then the other trades and is like, ""Thanks for the food!""

They talk about macaws and ravens failing the test, seems more like they were just thinking, ""yeah I don't trust this guy."""

wholesomememes,fdmdyam,t1_fdm908w,1578546787.0,">...so long as you are improving yourself constantly.

This is a big point especially considering the time with everyone having their shiny new New Year's Resolutions. Improving yourself constantly is most successfully done in small consistent steps. 

For example, weight loss, a lot of people go from a poor diet and next to no exercise and make a goal of ""In 2020 I'm working out 5x a week and going on (insert diet here)!"" Then maybe a few weeks in, miss a day or two of workouts, or cheat on their diet for a meal, and go ""ah well maybe next year.""

In reality you want to make realistic small, daily goals that work toward your larger goal. In my example above, maybe cook at home once or twice a week instead of eating out. Buy almonds instead of chips for your work snack. Walk to the corner store instead of driving. If you mess up on one of your small goals, no sweat, tomorrow is a new day. Then you build off of those small daily goals that you maintain, and months later, you suddenly realize you're closer to that ""unattainable"" behemoth goal than you ever thought you'd get and your motivation becomes a perpetual motion machine.

It works in any facet of life. Improve yourself daily as the above poster wisely said, even if it seems like an insignificant improvement in the big picture, those small improvements add up to be life changing."

From Ozzy talking about it later:
>""I used to black out a lot,"" Osbourne recalled during a discussion with the [London Evening Standard](http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/starinterviews/the-day-i-tried-to-kill-sharon-6584234.html). ""And my biggest fear was waking up in a police cell and having an old lady say to a police officer, 'Yes, that's the guy who ran my husband down,' or 'That's the guy who hit my son over the head with an axe. It used to terrify me. And then it happened – that day when I woke up in this little single cell with human shit up the walls – and I thought, 'What the fuck have I done now? Has one of my practical jokes backfired?'""
>
>It was no joke, as Osbourne soon discovered. ""I asked a police officer. I said: 'What am I here for?' I hadn't got a fucking clue. It's the most horrific feeling. He read me a piece of paper, and said, 'You're charged with attempting to murder Mrs. Sharon Osbourne.' I can't tell you how I felt. I just went numb.""

Short read so recommend just reading the article, but goddamn, that's probably the best (worst) ""reason to get on the wagon"" story I've read."

Edit: I also didn't just make that up, I watched a documentary on the case and the detective basically said that they didn't want to make the kid get on the stand at his father's trial and say what happened, and he acknowledged that a jury would likely not convict if they did make him do that."
therewasanattempt,fcwjynq,t1_fcwcc1b,1578027681.0,">Also theres live footage of the shooting and its fucking righteous.

That video was posted recently and made the front page. So many people in the comments talking about him getting away with murder. The plea deal was given because the chances of 12 members of a jury convicting a father of killing his son's kidnapper/rapist are basically nil.

A biker that killed a death row inmate for running his mouth about his other death row inmate buddy is not remotely the same situation either."

GetMotivated,fcoyawa,t1_fcops1r,1577844943.0,">But what if you don’t know what the right things are? Well turns out, you **fake it till you make it.** You start doing the things you think the happy people do, and slowly you will start to adopt the right behavior and be a happy person yourself.

""Fake it till you make it,"" may sound like a cliche because we hear it all the time, but man it's great advice in so many aspects of life. 

From being a happier person as you said, to getting that job/promotion you're after: ""Dress for the job you want, not the one you have,"" is the equivalent in this context. While you can literally do that too, it's moreso referring to your mindset and habits. This varies wildly depending on the field, but some general advice is learning as much as you can from someone already in that position, then offering to take on additional responsibilities and putting in the effort to complete them as well or better than someone already in that spot. Think opposite of r/NotMyJob

To being more confident around girls/guys: Act how you think a person with the confidence you want would act, and soon you'll find you're legitimately confident and it's no longer an act, you've simply gained that self confidence from putting yourself out there and seeing that people really are interested in *you.*

To me it's one of the greatest pieces of advice you can get if you really put thought into what it means and sincerely try it."

Whatcouldgowrong,fcm0ax0,t1_fclrjvc,1577760901.0,Comment above mentions the escapee's life basically took a turn for the worse when he met his biological father and was enamored by his drug dealer lifestyle.

Killers is probably the better word as you said. A gun owner *should* only ever consider using it against another person as a last resort in defense of their own or someone else's life, which wouldn't be murder. 

However, we don't live in a perfect world and yes we've seen many times where this is not the case and they do become murderers where they likely wouldn't have been had they not had a gun on them."

UpliftingNews,fc4dsjc,t1_fc3i2t8,1577413754.0,">Possible the title is wrong or the OP of this comment thread is wrong. Whoever is in second though isn't really close to catching Cena regardless.

OP here, I'll tell you what I know. There's no ""leader board"" on this and I tried to find as much as I could. When Cena hit 500, most of the articles cited Bieber as second with 270+, but even those articles said ""with only a few close by,"" or something similar. There are some articles noting Bieber hitting 300, but I can't find any info on the other folks.

The first part of my title comes from the article I linked:
>Not only does the actor hold the privilege of most wishes granted by a single individual, but he also happens to be the most requested celebrity for the foundation, according to [Today](https://www.today.com/parents/john-cena-has-fulfilled-dreams-580-make-wish-kids-t145722). Not many others make it past 300 wishes."
funny,fc2yehw,t1_fc2kdoy,1577377308.0,He's got far and away the most wishes granted with Make-A-Wish foundation. I believe only like 3 people (including him) have broken 300 wishes granted.. he just hit 600 this year.
