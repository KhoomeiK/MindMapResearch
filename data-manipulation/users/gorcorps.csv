If you don't think you'll have a problem adapting to the pad size, you can research costs for getting another cymbal.  It might still be a decent cost savings, or it might not be that much of a difference than just getting the exs 5 in the first place.

edrums,fel0fig,t1_fekvs9v,1579211395.0,"Yes, but that's only half of the equation (the input). Once the PC receives the midi command, the software generates a sound which then has to be processed by your sound card (or interface) and converted into a signal to drive the speakers or headphones.

The audio interface is purpose built for that type of job, and can do it much better than your built in sound card.  The midi signal is the input, which is quick and doesn’t need much help, but the audio processing (the output) is where the gains can be made with better equipment.

We’re talking factions of seconds here, but when you’re playing the drums those few hundred milliseconds can be pretty noticeable."
edrums,fekl57w,t1_fekehcl,1579202321.0,"So when you're playing through a VST without an external interface, the sound is likely being processed with the built in sound card, as most people don't have dedicated sound cards anymore. This is acceptable for most things, but when it comes to playing drums, the built in drivers aren't going to be able to process the sound fast enough to give you a lag free experience. So you get a delay between when you hit the pad and when you hear it.

The free way to deal with the latency is to download AISO4all, which is a driver made to use your built in sound card and reduce the latency.  However, the sound quality still isn't going to be great.  Maybe good enough for some people, but certainly not as good as it could sound.

An audio interface is a dedicated audio processor, so you get less latency and improved sound quality vs whatever your PC likely came with.  There's a lot of options out there that vary in price.  Having that built into the module means that you'll get that high quality audio with low latency without any extra equipment, as you won't be using your computers sound card at all."
edrums,fejiju4,t3_eozpeb,1579175795.0,"The integrated audio interface sounds pretty useful.  You usually have to get a separate interface to get high quality sounds at low latency when using PC software, so in theory you should be able to get that with just the module alone.
