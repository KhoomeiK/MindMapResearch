vegan,ff275pk,t1_ff0fqb9,1579495741.0,Not at all unusual for a decent restaurant in Washington.  Seems like you can’t get a normal burger at a sit down restaurant for under $14 or $15.

facepalm,few5eci,t1_feu9buv,1579405658.0,"Well, I think it might have been a Mexican restaurant with a bar and good/cheap margaritas if that makes it any better.  Can’t recall for sure."
