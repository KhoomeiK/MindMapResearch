Connecticut,ffu7chp,t1_ffrk8yl,1580236026.0,Care to elaborate on the rumors and myths? I’m curious now.
bulletjournal,fft0twq,t1_ffrw9p6,1580201036.0,"Also, you WILL improve over time. When I look at my first bullet journal I almost want to cringe but they were necessary mistakes I needed to make in order to learn."
bulletjournal,fft0qfb,t1_ffroais,1580200895.0,I also had this problem. I’ve found success in either shaving the edges of the stamp with an exacto knife OR coloring over the edge marks with a white gel pen. Just make sure the ink is fully dry first.
nextfuckinglevel,ffszjul,t1_ffsrm40,1580199241.0,"Sucks they want a living being they care for to be treated well, huh?"
nextfuckinglevel,ffsz53v,t1_ffsqrns,1580198686.0,Steve-o talks about how much he regrets stunts like these frequently.
youseeingthisshit,ffsyzw0,t1_ffssi1d,1580198493.0,I was seriously just thinking ‘fuck.... I’m going to cry aren’t I?’
Dogfree,ffs6deb,t1_ffqpqvk,1580174252.0,"Serious question. What if you’re an Uber driver, the dog is a legit service animal but you’re deathly allergic? Is that what you tacitly or even contractually agree to when becoming a driver?"
Dogfree,ffs5uni,t1_ffqt8e4,1580173886.0,I’m sure this will change very soon. They should be required to carry around a license as proof. I need one to prove I can drive. They should have one to prove they are doing a service.
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,ffqhjsl,t1_ffpt1ix,1580134780.0,Clearly you aren’t grooming your sheets properly you idiot. She’s trying to help!
CatGrabs,ffqgoqp,t1_ffq8vj7,1580134070.0,I’m not saying they don’t have super healthy coats but I also think you’re seeing their natural stripe pattern contouring to their curves creating the illusion of SUPER shininess. Beautiful boys regardless.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffq9q5t,t1_fefebdn,1580127359.0,I live in the US and frequently will throw pennies in the trash.... if I’m sweeping up at work and there’s a penny on the ground it’s 100% getting swept up and thrown out. Idc if I’m throwing out twenty bucks a year. Pennies are gross and kinda pointless....
insanepeoplefacebook,ffq95t1,t1_fdl13q6,1580126683.0,Honest question as I’m not having kids so I’ve never needed to know.... let’s say you’re pregnant and just simply don’t want to deliver vaginally. Can you just get a c section? Or are they always due to special circumstances?
nba,ffq2ldz,t1_ffpvw33,1580116942.0,I would assume they’ll heal and grow together. I couldn’t imagine but at least she’s not alone.
pics,ffq213a,t1_ffq1riv,1580116049.0,My parents crashed basically and the balloon dragged across a field because wind conditions weren’t ideal. It was at a ‘balloon festival’ which I found weird because every other time I personally went up in the balloon conditions had to be PERFECT or he (my dad’s best friend) didn’t even consider going up. But at this festival you went up no matter what? We watched the balloon crash land and drag inches from where someone had burned a couch and mattress. My mom’s hair got caught under the basket so she couldn’t lift her head and she hasn’t had long hair since. She got a concussion and they all got several cuts and bruises. Shockingly no broken bones. Had they landed slightly harder or a foot to the right they’d have either died or gotten cut up beyond belief. My mom basically would’ve been scalped by the burned out couch frame. There was another time with just my dad and his friend where he wanted to lightly ‘skim the water’ in a pond and the basket instantly sank. All balloons are followed by a chase vehicle so his wife was PISSED at the pond thing. The first time I went up we landed in a tiny backyard because we tried to land in a field but the chase vehicle couldn’t get to us to grab the tether line. Those people woke up to quite the shock. A hot air balloon hitting their deck....
Unexpected,ffq158r,t1_ffpcufq,1580114702.0,Not enough fire.
pics,ffq0t6z,t1_ffpxvqr,1580114203.0,I’ve been in a hot air balloon several times. Can confirm. Never again. My parents almost died while I watched from the chase vehicle.
aww,ffq0n5c,t1_ffprigq,1580113955.0,"No, no he did. You just trained him well. I hate when people tell me my cat is ‘basically a dog.’ No, I just trained him properly."
OldSchoolCool,ffnj7zg,t1_ffn9l8m,1580066643.0,Huh.... TIL.
Unexpected,ffll4v9,t1_ffjx9i2,1580040910.0,I read that most cats raised in zoos that can’t be rehabilitated into the wild for whatever reason are raised with a puppy so they learn how to play gentle. Take solace in knowing they are probably best friends.
perfectlycutscreams,fflj4q1,t1_ffki70v,1580040294.0,This is the most genuine one I’ve seen in awhile on here.
geocaching,fflczxj,t3_etsr4c,1580037935.0,Not my main one but I’ve found multiple caches with religious literature in them. It’s 1. Not allowed 2. Not your place to preach and 3. Just a game. Leave the religion out of it. And I don’t live in a religious area which means one person or group is doing it.
geocaching,fflc9x2,t1_ffkcrlf,1580037753.0,"I don’t even sign if they’re gross. I hate the way old, soggy, moldy logbooks make my hands smell. No amount of hand sanitizer helps. I just take a pic and send it to the cache owner to prove I was there."
Dogfree,fflby96,t1_ffl3t6s,1580037605.0,"Before I refused to go places with dogs I would just blatantly say it. I’m NOT scared, I’m grossed out. Now I just avoid them all together."
Dogfree,fflbqkd,t3_eu4d11,1580037505.0,Take solace in knowing she’s slowly killing them and it’s no one’s fault but her own.
Dogfree,ffl927a,t1_ffjdrqy,1580036583.0,I always wonder this. I say it’s like breeding raptors. There is no real reason to do it besides morbid curiosity? Or maybe it’s an ego thing? Same with all overly aggressive breeds and deformed breeds like pugs and dachshunds.
TalesFromYourServer,ffl8fhs,t1_ffk1rco,1580036239.0,A Wisconsin style old fashioned is only welcomed in Wisconsin don’t forget. They’re popular everywhere but if you put brandy in my old fashioned I’d be a bit pissed lol.
ZeroWaste,ffl3ji4,t3_etw7gx,1580034156.0,Is the bottle still recyclable once cut? Just curious. Could negate the ‘zero waste’ aspect in the longer run.
brooklynninenine,ffl39gx,t1_ffjeau0,1580034009.0,France.
secretcompartments,ffl01b3,t3_eu1xu4,1580032281.0,But.... why? All you could do is just.... sit in it. Alone.
Catswithjobs,ffbhrpm,t1_ffb2dyg,1579765884.0,Yeah I just walk both of mine on the leash to get their fix.
CoolCollections,ff9vwxd,t1_ff96ds0,1579722670.0,Absolutely. They’re just taking up space. I have them in a chain in rainbow order. I’ll prob keep a few I’ve had since I was a kid but other wise there’s maybe fifty or so collecting dust. Pm me your address and I’ll ship them out soon. I’d rather someone who appreciates them take them rather then me throwing them out.
Collections,ff8r1k3,t1_f0yqkq8,1579692584.0,Where do you live? I see it at every liquor store. I could ship if you like :)
CoolCollections,ff8p64w,t3_en9j40,1579689953.0,"Man, I have a goddamn wad of keychains you can just have if you don’t mind bottle openers and other random things that say beer brands on them. I’ve been a bartender for over ten years and keep one of every keychain I come across for some reason. They’re all wasting space in a drawer.

Edit: omg your broadway ones... did we just become best friends?"
CoolCollections,ff8p200,t1_fepqsj4,1579689780.0,There are dozens of us....

tacobell,ff6ave3,t3_erv2s6,1579623160.0,"Don’t hate me, but Taco Bell is my favorite because it’s super vegetarian friendly. This is the one item I’ve been told they put in the fryer that contains meat so I personally really hope they don’t come back. I’m sorry reddit. I just want untainted food!"
Interestingbutcreepy,ff6a8tk,t3_eru17a,1579622758.0,Ok... how many of those are going to get caught in that filter?
Dogfree,ff69wcp,t1_ff66e69,1579622532.0,I saw one ‘service dog’ (I can’t tell the real ones from the imposters anymore!) the first day and never saw it again thankfully. I was worried that I was going to bump into it the whole vacation but thankfully I could finally relax.
Dogfree,ff5zapc,t3_erroa5,1579615000.0,We were in Miami for a day before our honeymoon cruise and I was horrified at how many people thought bringing dogs EVERYWHERE including grocery stores was ok... my husband had to give me the ‘please don’t say anything’ glare several times.
terrariums,ff5yprl,t1_ff5ec02,1579614526.0,Meaning they don’t really have to mess around with it too much for it to thrive.
greebles,ff5i042,t3_erfilb,1579593758.0,I thought the dog was a puma at first...
ThriftStoreCats,ff5gao9,t3_erqaur,1579591589.0,Bonus- they don’t look like they’ve been worn. I’m willing to be someone’s grandma bought these for them because ‘she loves cats! So she’ll love these!’ and they politely donated them without grandma even knowing....
Broadway,ff5g32r,t1_fehhi12,1579591330.0,I’m sure they’re trying to say ‘journey to the past’ but there were way better emoji combos for that.
insaneparents,ff53o6d,t1_ff4nexf,1579579348.0,One girl accused him of something and had no proof. He did apologize however indicating that he felt guilty of something. I don’t know what to believe but I’m inclined to think it’s not as bad as first suspected.
geocaching,ff30oi1,t3_er8gkp,1579530528.0,I will gladly send some out in my area if you’d like! I’m in New England!

Gary_The_Cat,fewviuw,t1_fero2xl,1579420146.0,How old is he and how did you know he needed teeth removed? I’m just curious for future edification.
TalesFromYourServer,fetn3uu,t1_feouq0i,1579377061.0,"It sucks super hard for vegetarians but I’ve just accepted my fate and don’t even think twice about it. ‘Can I have no bacon, add broccoli?’ I’m constantly getting charged for the meat I don’t eat and up charged for the much cheaper vegetable I want to add. Oh well."
Broadway,fem8x16,t1_fehy720,1579244091.0,"He probably has that ‘the show must go on!’ mentality. I hear this with broadway actors, standup comedians and athletes alike- they convince themselves they’re fine and 90% of the time it works. This may be an example of the 10% it doesn’t."

AdviceAnimals,fejzmlj,t1_fejp77p,1579189443.0,I hate them! My thumb ring chipped the edge of it on day one and now the whole thing is ruined. Where the hell can I get the plastic ones anymore?!
boymeetsworld,fejug03,t1_feimk74,1579186107.0,Apparently the reason you rarely see any one on one talk between Shawn and Eric is because they’re best friends in real life and always made each other laugh and break character.
gifs,feeovqe,t1_fco0lt1,1579038133.0,You can call the town and report it as an eyesore and claim it devalues your property. My dad did this to my old neighbor because he had like five old trucks and a literal helicopter in the backyard and he had to get rid of most of them.

Dogfree,fecyvbf,t1_fec47f6,1578990355.0,Service dogs will hopefully REQUIRE licenses soon enough. Too many people are abusing the system.

vegetarian,fe9v17z,t1_fe9ec8d,1578941721.0,I swear by that stuff! Every vegetarian Better than Bouillon they make is what I was missing for years of searching. It’s hard to make ‘chicken’ noodle soup taste like you remember from childhood without their veg chicken stock.
ThatLookedExpensive,fe1o1rr,t1_fdxo66e,1578828891.0,Yeah I didn’t see how growing carrots was a problem...
Dogfree,fduqfjp,t3_en4fyd,1578737364.0,I can’t believe people have gotten away with it this far without needing a proper license to prove their dog is an actual service dog. When I was a kid it made me happy to see the occasional service dog in action! Now I’m dodging frauds left and right... They act offended when you ask about them too. I need proper identification and so should they. I’m assuming this will change very soon. Too many people are abusing it.

AskReddit,fdlrgtl,t1_fdl6q95,1578530742.0,"Yeah, I’m not having kids but I kinda hope my siblings do so I can fuck with them. My sister and her wife are currently in the very long and expensive process of trying to get her wife pregnant and I’m assuming the kid will be confused at all the woman in their life. ‘My moms aren’t sisters but this is YOUR sister, but not HER sister?’ It’ll be amusing."
