Then what do you think the french are doing with their nuclear backed load-following grid? At the end of the day a nuclear power plant is a steam turbine plant. If you want to stop producing power just release steam somewhere other than the generator. And it you need more, then close the vents again. Firming capacity is something intermittent power plants do because they are shit. A real power plant generates electricity when it's needed, not if the conditions are right.

The french have a used capacity of 77% on their power plants due to load following. And that is out of 84% availability!

The market is building renewable because that is where the public funding's at. Not because it makes the grid work better. [Literally less than a week ago](https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/launching-just-transition-mechanism-green-transition-based-solidarity-and-fairness-2020-jan-15_en).

The cost and C02 of wind and solar look fantastic. Especially when it comes to wind. But when you must an enourmus amount of transmission linse crisscrossing the continent and massive energy storage facilities it increases the real cost. Do you really not get that?

>Other factors would also have a potentially significant effect on the results contained herein, but have not been examined in the scope of this analysis. These additional factors, among others, could include: import tariffs; capacity value vs. energy value; stranded costs related to distributed generation or otherwise; network upgrade, transmission, congestion or other integration-related costs; significant permitting or other development costs, unless otherwise noted; and costs of complying with various environmental regulations (e.g., carbon emissions offsets or emissions control systems). This analysis also does not address potential social and environmental externalities, including, for example, the social costs and rate consequences for those who cannot afford distributed generation solutions, as well as the long-term residual and societal consequences of various conventional generation technologies that are difficult to measure (e.g., nuclear waste disposal, airborne pollutants, greenhouse gases, etc.)

Yeah, Norway is powered mainly by hydro. But we also frequently buy power from Sweden who generate about half of theirs from nuclear. Finland of course is mainly nuclear and gas. Demark is the only country that actually has a majority wind, and they can only do that because they import electricity from Norway and Sweden when the winds not blowing.

Try toying with the board on the left. You can choose to see production in individual wind power plants as well if you check off ""[wind offshore](https://energy-charts.de/power.htm?source=wind-offshore&year=2019&month=1)"" And see production on other plants from other sources there as well.

Try looking under the button next to ""conv. >100 MW"" for lumping things together. But i don't think there is any option for adding a power consumption line.

Those buttons on top of the graph are interactable as well. FYI"
worldnews,fd3dkjd,t1_fczomrd,1578157241.0,"Yes, right now Germany is at 40GW (60GW capacity) from wind. About 55% of what they use. But at other times that output drops to about 0.5GW. If we're ever going to have a grid based on intermittent sources we're going to need storage solutions that don't add significantly to CO2 output, are immensly energy dense, and very low cost. Because we don't just need to save power for the night. We might need to save power for the next week, possibly even the next two weeks.

Futurology,fcvuxyv,t1_fcvqv5q,1578010677.0,"Large amounts of biofuel could work if you preproduced it and stored it. But that increases soil depletion and that might actually be the greatest danger we're facing.

Building large amounts of different power sources can be viable, but does the action fit the intent? If our purpose is to build the least co2 emmiting *stable* energy grid for the cheapest cost, is it to the point to build 160% demand  with intermittent sources, biofuel and nuclear + 100% storage?  We'd need atleast that much storage to supply 10% of demand for only 10 hours.

If Lazard have their prices right: https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2018/
I don't think it's the best.

Personally I'm thinking massive amounts of nuclear power is the best. But that'd require politicians to actually be competent for it to be viable.

So that's obviously a fantasy.

I think that the autonomus cars coming in the future might change the state of car ownerships and car's inactivity periods. But maybe it will work out as you say, that'd probably be the best result."
Futurology,fcvpp2g,t1_fcvoc0d,1578007297.0,"But societal demand goes by present demand, not average demand. So KW in this second is more relevant than cost/KWh over the year. 

You just can't have a electrical grid where you can suddenly have no electricity.

Germany for instance has a wind electricity capacity of 60GW. But occasionally it can produce less than 1GW.

There are just so many hidden factors that don't get their part said for cost/KWh to be informative. It only really matters if we have some magical seasonal energy storage.

worldnews,fc5y5bd,t1_fc5ub5m,1577468316.0,"In your opinion what does it require to be in a military alliance?

I think it requires a public treaty and open declarations of intent. I don't think covert treaties will work in democratic countries. And i don't think being members of two different, if intersecting, defence pacts make you allies."
worldnews,fc5outp,t1_fc5jeux,1577462853.0,"That is the biggest question there is about NATO. And noone really know's how it will turn out.

My take on it is that it will be a limited war fought only in Sweden and Finland. As in Poland doesn't invade Kalingrad and the Baltic countries don't attack St Petersburg and vice versa. Instead they will fight largely in Finland and possibly on the Kola peninnsula and russian Karelia.

Because in article 6 it explains in two different points that it is the territory that is protected and occupying foces stationed before the signing is also protected. I think that will mean that EU forces fighting in Finland or Sweden will not be covered by the treaty. Should the war expand to the baltic and Kalingrad then that could be considered a counterattack by Russia, and that could free non-EU NATO states from military intervention. Going by how Turkey did not recieve assurances from NATO should the Syrian military attack them.

Another posssible answer is that it depends on what United States feel like doing. Do they join immediately to show themselves to be  the defender of the western world, or do they stay neutral to show the worth of any alliance that doesn't involve them.

Norway will probably join US in whatever they chose to do. Though obviously there'd be a very porous border between Norway and Sweden and Finland where supplies and weapons cross freely."

It's not something that pulls anyone in, it's how you organize your forces when you're already involved.  Make clear the hirarchy in a hypothetical situation before the situation has appeared spares a great deal of time when shit hits the fan. 

Say if every country in the UK expeditionary force decides to intervene in... Syria. Then the Expeditionary force framework is how it will be commanded. It's UK and partner countries agreeing before hand that UK is in charge if the United states is not in charge. [Like when UK, Norway and Netherlands cooperated during the ebola outbreak they were utilizing JEF framework](https://sldinfo.com/2019/04/uk-joint-expeditionary-force-deploys-to-baltic-sea/).

worldnews,fc5gxfu,t1_fc5eux4,1577457280.0,"Do you have a source for that claim? There is to my knowledge no such agreement binding Norway and Iceland (and Denmark) to intervene.

Finland is a Partner of NATO in Partnership for Peace. So is Russia, and it does not include a collective defence clause.

Finland is also a member  of the EU's *Common Security and Defence Policy*, this does have a collective defence policy, but Norway, Iceland and Denmark are not members(I was wrong earlier when i said Denmark was allied with every nordic state).

Every nordic country is of course member of Nordic Defence Cooperation, but that does not include collective defence. 

And then Finland have bilateral ties to Sweden and USA. But not to the degree of collective defence.

There is a lot of cooperation between the nordic nations. But there is no military alliances except memberships in NATO and Common Security and Defence Policy, both of which are incomplete."
worldnews,fc5bvuj,t1_fc524od,1577452625.0,"Then our disagreement is on what a military alliance is. I don't think the extensive military partnership is on the level of an alliance.
