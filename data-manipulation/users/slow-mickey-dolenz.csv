unpopularopinion,fdqq5hh,t1_fdqej3b,1578672488.0,"Agreed. He’s great when playing off other people, and he’s wildly entertaining. I probably saw 5 of his movies before I even realized he did stand up and thought he was hilarious. When someone sent me a link to his stand up act, I was psyched and couldn’t wait to watch it. Half way through, after not having laughed once, I turned it off and went back to work."

In most cases, it’s completely fake. You were not born talking with the extreme sing song lisp, and you didn’t grow up talking this way. You’ve hijacked a speech pattern and tone that you think is cute and you want everybody to know your sexual preference. There’s a Starbucks down the street from me that I think pays their employees more for acting extra gay, and it’s so irritating that my overly accepting wife won’t even go there anymore."
