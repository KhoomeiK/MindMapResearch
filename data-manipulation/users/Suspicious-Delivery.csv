ChevyTahoe,fficmtj,t1_ffic1ch,1579970690.0,"The hours logged and the low oil pressure. It sat idling for a long time (as police do) but it was only putting out around 15 psi at idle. That paired with high oil consumption as well, I just bit the bullet and swapped it. Dealer told me that they discovered highly worn cam lobes and several smeared rod bearings. She still drove onto the flatbed under her own power, never left me stranded. The transmission is perfect and even after riding her hard or in stop and go traffic she never gets above 180F."
ChevyTahoe,ffibnzf,t1_ffiaiga,1579970031.0,"Truck brand new was ~$75k, i got it for ~$24k with ~60k miles, dealer dropped in the motor for around ~$8k with a 3 year/100,000 mile GM powertrain warranty.  

I also took it and got it street tuned with my preferred GM performance shop, removed the speed limiter, tightened up the shifts, and upped the power. She FLIES on the highway."
ChevyTahoe,ffi90og,t1_ffi7sgk,1579968192.0,"No, the GMT900 SUVs never got a diesel, unfortunately. Instead of coming with the old standard LMG 5.3L V8 and 6L80E, she has the L96 6.0L and the 6L90E. 

Along with the beefier drivetrain and internals, it sits higher than a standard Suburban 1500, it lacks the Active Fuel Management (cylinder deactivation) that becomes problematic in the future (AFM lifters are shit), but still has VVT, and it can pull 9,400 lbs in the 4x4 version,  and 9,600 lbs in the RWD. It also has the heavy duty front subframe and suspension. Mine is the 4x4 and has the tow package, its also a 9 seater (bench seat in the front!). It has the roof mounted police antenna, 12V power connection to the roof, aftermarket provisions for a solar panel battery charger, extended fuel capacity (39 GALLONS) and provisions for a secondary battery (just need to buy the battery and the tiedowns but the harness is still there).

I didnt trust the motor after i saw the engine hours and the oil pump was putting out way lower than i found acceptable. Had the dealer drop in a fully warranteed brand spanking new L96 into it. It pulls like a freight train and sounds like a Camaro SS while doing it. Plus everyone gets the hell out of my way, no one cuts me off, and every time i put my blinker on there's always room next to me.

I think the only thing that could make this truck any better would be a Duramax, but the aftermarket swap price just isnt worth dropping all that cash on."

If you do have 4x4 (and if you do, see if you have automatic mode) and its engaging the transfer case, it could cause a low speed whine as well.

The doctor looks at my hand and goes ""huh, that's weird"". It took them 6 months to find a half inch piece of glass that severed two tendons in my forearm. By that point the tendons (middle finger and index extensor tendons) had retracted and atrofied into my arm, and the remaining tendons had coiled up and scarified to the remaining tendons and the flesh on the back of my hand. Had it been found immediately when I first reported it, my tendons could have been reattached via emergency surgery. Instead I had to have the tendons grafted to other tendons in my hand (middle finger to ring finger, and inside index tendon to the outside index tendon) and I have significantly reduced function in that hand. 

My lawyer said it wouldn't even be worth it to sue the hospital and it came out of the insurance of the kid that hit me.
