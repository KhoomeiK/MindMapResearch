politics,ff6de6j,t1_ff6a405,1579624759.0,"Your right, it is.

Here's the thing - Biden isn't president right now. His corruption, if real, isn't nearly as damaging as the one from the current president. What you're doing right now is essentially trying to raise the panic about a *possible* wasp while a known, armed Nuke is about to blow up right next to you - hence why you are coming off as disingenuous.

But let's ignore that for a moment and go to your initial argument - that if Bernie lied about this, he's untrustworthy. First of all, that's a false equivalency - even if, say, we had evidence Bernie lied (because there's the possibility he just thinks Biden is influenced by political donors more than the citizenry, but not corrupt), that would not negate the truths of his core policies, nor would it be nearly enough to outdo his consistency on his core platforms.

Second, if you wanted to be an absolutist about him lying, you're also doing it in a way that creates a false parallel - that all lies are done for malicious reasons. There can be reasons where lying can be far more moral than not doing so - like lying to a Nazi that you are hiding a Jew for example. That lie doesn't make the person untrustworthy, it makes them moral.

dialysis,fdnpyjg,t1_fdnojqm,1578590652.0,"HDF isn't allowed in the USA and Canada due to lobbying from Dialysis companies, but it tends to be far superior than dialysis alone.

In HDF, you are pumped full of ultra-pure water during a Dialysis treatment. Toxins etc then transfer into this ultra pure water inside of you during the treatment - think if it as PD, but occuring in your entire body through the circulatory system.

This also removes certain elements much more effectively than dialysis alone, like phosphorus. There's a 33% decreased mortality rate after 4-5 on HDF compared to HD alone, and 80% difference at around 10 years.

You also cramp significantly less and tend to not go through low blood pressure, since water is being added to your blood circulation as it's being removed. Most importantly, you prevent ""Dialysis brain"" since there's no significant fluid shifts in the cranial region.

Since I've started HDF, I've once again been able to exercise, have had very stable phosphorus levels, and even started working once more. At one point I even no longer needed medication for anemia, as the condition has stabilized on it's own, and I'm now on a very low amount of blood pressure/beta blocker medication.

This is true even for newer games that are HD remakes.
Like the Majora's Mask remake- I'd much rather play it on the TV than a handheld, since that's how I played it in my childhood. I owned the game (had to leave it back in Texas when I moved, though I still technically own it), but never played past the first day because the controls bothered me and I didn't like the small screen play. I waited to see if Nintendo would port it over to the Switch. They never did, and so I ended up using Citra and an upscale program that only had the top 3DS screen viewed on a TV, and a USB N64 controller mapped so all button controls could be physical.

A good deal of pirating would be reduced if companies just released the old games in an easy to play format on newer hardware at a greatly reduced price.
