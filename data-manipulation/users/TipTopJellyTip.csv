Wellington,ffhkto1,t3_etizlv,1579939942.0,Beautiful.  You should post this to r/spiders too.
aww,ffg2qk5,t3_etf2re,1579897191.0,And a very tasty looking chocolate roll she is.
tipofmytongue,fffv3ql,t3_etenfq,1579892448.0,Was it a British show?  There was a TV program called 'Come Fly With Me'
aww,fffuk3a,t3_etep27,1579892110.0,He's uncovered some warm possibilities.

No lamb at all? That's a shame!  

I had a look at the local supermarket online and it costs NZ$29.99 / US$19.86 for an 8 rib rack of lamb."

CA_Kitchen,ff038kp,t1_fezzpzx,1579464742.0,Oh awesome.  That will be interesting to compare prices.
CA_Kitchen,fezzffq,t1_fezwvqf,1579463526.0,Oh interesting.  I wonder if it's as expensive there as it is here.  Hope you can find some mint sauce that's more savoury.
codeine,fezvaeg,t3_eqy1ou,1579462115.0,Take 5.  No CWE.
CA_Kitchen,fezu1yz,t1_fexis0k,1579461657.0,I come from New Zealand and we seem to copy a lot of things from the Brits.  I have to admit I love mint sauce so much I even have it on pork sometimes.
CA_Kitchen,feztmuw,t1_fexnl33,1579461507.0,We have pies with chucks of lamb in it here too and they're very nice.  I'm off to Ireland in a few months so might have to try one there.
CA_Kitchen,feztgc5,t1_feyhzpq,1579461436.0,"It was good!  And enough left overs for lunch today, dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  :)"
CA_Kitchen,feztbyd,t1_fezj9is,1579461389.0,"I live in New Zealand so got it from a Pak'n'Save supermarket.  It's the best one I've tried so far.  It's more savoury.  

I have mint jelly in the fridge but it's sooooo sweet, this one is heaps better.  

My grandparents were sheep farmers so used to be spoilt with fresh lamb, but not any more.  Most of our lamb gets exported so it's really expensive to buy here sadly."
CA_Kitchen,fewnl46,t1_fewm3uo,1579415884.0,I love a good Sunday night roast.  It leaves left overs for Monday lunchtime sammies.
CA_Kitchen,fewlezd,t1_fewkuqy,1579413553.0,Just finished.  It was totally worth it.  :)
Wellington,fewge8d,t3_eqocci,1579410143.0,There's no sign at all of any fog where I am in Lower Hutt.  Weird.
spiders,fet81ma,t3_eqhxeg,1579372605.0,Very cool! I've never heard of a Vinegaroon.  It looks a bit like a Weta.

cripplingalcoholism,fejazhz,t1_fejarzb,1579164885.0,"$6.97.... That is a deal!!  Hehe...  Yeah, it would be good to have something cheaper though."
cripplingalcoholism,feja3hd,t3_epe8eg,1579163610.0,Don't know about anything cheaper.  $7 from Pak'n'Save is about the best you're going to get probably - $6.99 if you're reaaaallly lucky.
askakiwi,fe6njgr,t1_fe3x6he,1578897103.0,I think you were watching 'Wellington Paranormal'  ;p

AmItheAsshole,fcw7tlr,t3_ej6vbg,1578019127.0,"YTA - He was nice enough to let you borrow it.  It was under your care and got damaged.  Whether it was your fault or not, it's still your responsibility to return it in the condition you borrowed it in.  Pay up and save your friendship.   Oh - And apologise for being a dick about it."
pets_of_ca,fctm78j,t1_fctl4tm,1577948578.0,They are gorgeous.  Just deliver the snow to New Zealand.  It's the middle of our summer so you may need to wrap it in a few extra layers otherwise it could get messy.  Thanks.  :)
CA_Kitchen,fct1znn,t1_fct1op2,1577930798.0,Ooooh.  Thanks for clearing that up.  I had never realised that was an offensive term.  I've learnt something today!!  :)
CA_Kitchen,fct1h75,t1_fcszqli,1577930424.0,Oh Ok.  Is it offensive to call Native Americans 'Indians'?  Please excuse my ignorance.

AveragePicsOfNZ,fcsx4xk,t3_eife5c,1577927336.0,Flew from Chch to Wellington this morning and the haze is definitely much worse in Christchurch.
CA_Kitchen,fcswv0x,t3_eilwzr,1577927142.0,Can I ask what is offensive about these?
Wellington,fcmqobz,t3_ei0kf6,1577787454.0,It's great.  It has a good atmosphere and the cafe has very nice food too.
