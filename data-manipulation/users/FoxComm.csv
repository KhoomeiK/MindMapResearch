skyrimvr,ff88zne,t3_es6785,1579669514.0,"The Rift S is the only VR headset I’ve ever had so I can’t compare it from experience to other headsets, but the inside out tracking works so well (and I pretty much use only archery) 99% of the time I swear it can see all around my head, even if I pull the arrow way back behind my ear. The display and FOV might be lower compared to other headsets but the price is so worth it for barely any noticeable trade off that I can easily recommend it."
