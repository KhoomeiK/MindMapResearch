AskReddit,ffxhtnj,t1_ffwwjyo,1580325437.0,"I disagree or have disagreed with friends about very fundamental issues. Life gets kind of boring when everyone around you just agrees.

My favorite example is that my best friend did not want my child in her house. She found that upsetting at the time. So we talked about why she felt that. I was not willing to not see him in the little time I had. So we saw each other only in public spaces for a few years, as that worked for both of us. 

Many people have told me they would have just dropped that friend, 20 years worth of history or not. But really, it was so easy to find a compromise. I don’t get all the hate and defensiveness sometimes. Especially between friends."
AskReddit,ffxh8zp,t1_ffx1j2b,1580325106.0,"I really have never met a person I would call toxic. 

Needy? Sure, but we all have periods like that. I can be needy at times too. Lonely? Sure. Asking more help than giving right now? I get that that can happen. 

What do they even mean with toxic? People disagreeing with them?"

YouShouldKnow,ffwbyne,t1_ffw6nou,1580294589.0,My Peugeot makes sure you don’t self-destruct. The whole car starts beeping like mad when the red light comes on. You don’t want to drive that fire engine.
YouShouldKnow,ffwbsty,t1_ffvxf0l,1580294369.0,"I have no clue what to do, but I’ve read up enough to understand my excellent mechanic. I work 40 hours, have 2 kids, and a household to run. I have about 30 minutes a day that I would like to relax.

By all means, if there’s an excellent Netflix series on car maintenance lemme know and I’ll watch."

AskReddit,ffu2hnl,t1_ffu0qgh,1580233078.0,"We decided valentine’s day was the day we first met (we both can’t quite remember the date, but it was in February). So we have a legit reason to be giving gifts and celebrating our partnership every 14th of February. The whole romantic setting in the shops makes it real easy too. :D"
funny,ffu26ez,t1_ffu1qji,1580232885.0,"I’m very particular about the exact fat percentage as well and I can always taste when the cows have been grass fed again after winter season with hay. 

My partner just rolls his eyes about my qualms and tells me it all basically tastes the same."
funny,ffu1hxp,t1_fftw16p,1580232465.0,For me it’s the lack of sugar in plant milks that leave a weird watery taste.

It also makes me feel that he has lost connection to you. But that’s just a feeling and I can’t give a good reason of why that feels that way.

Your perception and his perception seem very different. I hope you can find each other in therapy."
