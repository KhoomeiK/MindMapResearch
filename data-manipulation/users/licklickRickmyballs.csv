oddlysatisfying,ff9l4g8,t1_ff9iol7,1579715290.0,"When small kiddo, playing Crash Bandicoot my older brother would always go ""Thats a fault!"" upon death. Took me years to realise that he meant a fault of his own and not a bug in the game.

For some reason your comment made me think of that."
AskReddit,ff64jj5,t3_ero8mj,1579618948.0,"When I was 13 my goal was to move to a different country at a young age. Ideally to move there and meet a sweet girl.

I'm now 22 and I live in a different country, with the same girl I was in love with back then. So I guess you could say that all my dreams have come true. I'm sure my 13 year old self would shit his pants in excitement.

Only side henge is, that now I'm here, I'm starting to realise that this is not enough. I want more out of life than slinging beers for minimum wage and scrambling to pay the rent.

What really worries me is what present me will think of 50 year old me."

Resume,ff4hz9j,t3_embr9s,1579564067.0,"Hmm I guess It's hard to list it different on your resume. But what I'd do was to describe how you've actually been doing administrative work In a motivational letter and attach it. Hook em up with the phone number from your former manager if you are tight.

And most importantly, if one place dosen't work out, stick to it and just keep sending them out there!

Edit: You could also go all out and list it as ""Armed security administration manager""."

Graffiti,fezt3g1,t1_fezjq3f,1579461301.0,He was talking raw numbers I believe. Even if you count UK as 100% fluent speaking they would barely hit half the amount with their 60-something million people.
Graffiti,fezsltg,t1_fewvamh,1579461121.0,"To be fair, India's also very very populated. I'm sure that if you compare the precentage of people who speaks fluent english, it's far from second highest.

Edit: Got curious so looked it up. From what i could find, India actually only have 12,5% of their population who can speak English. I don't think It's so wierd to assume that they don't speak English. I count France as a non-english speaking country and supposedly they have 39%."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdspym5,t1_fdsl7mn,1578706433.0,So he is getting downvoted for assuming there is a context to this? That seems pretty ignorant.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdsi4me,t1_fdsh4s1,1578703184.0,Well worded. Have my upvote.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdsi117,t1_fdsb05t,1578703129.0,"Probably gonna get downvoted for this but fuck it. I'm with ya. The officer is a shitbag, but to say that he almost killed her is an exaggeration. He could have killed her, but that would have to be a freak accident. Murder was clearly not the intention.

Edit: actually I find the original comment to be beyond dogshit. How could this get so many upvotes? First he states that he *thinks* they do it because of an argument. Then he proceeds to call out the police officer for trying to kill her as revenge for what he think has happened. And then the end, *this is clear abusing authority*. Yeah? No shit Sherlock."

natureismetal,fdh6pqk,t1_fdh2lsp,1578416562.0,"My personal take: I'm far from a proffesional, but given thoose spikes are designed to work themselves inwards my first thought would be, that this would become lethal. But I'm conflicted. Certain fish become very old and in the process gather whole stacks of hooks that stick to their interior. Maybe the gator is as hardcore as the fish and just keeps at it. I read sometime back, that crocodiles blood is naturally equipped with a form of penicilin making them immune to infections. If this applies to the gator species aswell, I think it has a solid chance of survival. The long spikes will be reduced to splinters within days, and the gator could carry on like normal, more or less. Still It's a tough price for a meal, to get permanent splinters. Poor fellow must have been desperate."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fdh2sz1,t3_elb901,1578414156.0,"When i was 4 and on vacation, I was chillin' in the pool. I had my blowup shoulderpads equipped, but what really made my day, was this new awesome floatable blowup seal my parents had bought me. Fucker was tough to balance on, but I was well on my way to mastering it. That is untill a wrong move takes me out of balance. I fall of the seal and in the process bump my right toe unto the edge of the pool. As i come to my senses I make sure. No blood, no bruise, and nowhere near a broken toe. All in all I'm good except for a small stinging pain. So i do what any 4-year oldswould do. Open my mouth and let out a horrifying scream. My parents is quick to react, but even quicker is the stranger sitting next to them. Within seconds he is headiving into the pool despite being fully clothed. Hero didn't even have time to drop his phone or wallet before jumping in. He carries me to my parents where I explain what happened. Quite suprised, he responds that he figured I was having cramps given the screams. Well I wasen't, but ode to him for sacrifising his phone and whatever bills he was carrying in his wallet."

It becomes real dangerous when more common thoughts starts to make  you think of it aswell. For a period my brain linked It with trying to think of something i had forgotten; *Shit where did i put them keys? Why the hell can't I remember?* And then outta no where *BAM! I lost the game*."
