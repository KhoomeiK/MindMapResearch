I just feel that all tanks should be equally tanky. All healers should be equally “healy”, and the same for damage.

I understand that many heroes would lose their “flavor”, but what good is flavor when you force others to taste it?"
Overwatch,ffe8jru,t3_esoiy1,1579839630.0,"Okay before I ask this question, I just want to say that I’m okay with an ever changing meta from balance updates. I understand that its what the community at large wants and I respect that.

My question is why not have a stable meta and balance? I feel as though a forcefully shifted meta would only put the game at constant risk of being thrown out of balance. Sure, other heroes need a chance to shine, but can’t there just be a meta that only gives a *slight* advantage? So slight that it wouldn’t really impact a usual game of competitive to play off meta?

Again, I understand I’m in the minority. I just want someone to *politely* explain why I’m wrong."

- The same command should never be said twice in a row.

- Maybe even lower the message limit from 4 to 3 or even 2.

- a sorry command would be amazing and very useful for accidental falls, and addressing tilt

- No more “I need healing”, just have the character say “Help” because it would be much less of an accusation towards healers. 

- Thank you should not be enabled when dead (or most of the other commands for that matter) because of sarcastic assholes who abuse the system when it’s meant to help players express gratitude."

So it makes sense that I ended up criticizing the predominate religion in my country. I’m gonna go out on a limb and assume that many other Americans are the same way.

So yeah, its true that many Americans on reddit have a bias for other religions while being against Christianity, but I wouldn’t be so quick to blame them. Besides, it doesn’t make Christianity anything too special that its followers have become more peaceful. There all referred to as religions for a reason. They have a lot in common."
