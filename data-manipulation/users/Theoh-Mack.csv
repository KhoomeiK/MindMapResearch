ShouldIbuythisgame,ffrk8w2,t1_ffq2us1,1580159741.0,"Not to mention HZD is getting ported to PC. It's been proven, they are missing out on lots of revenue by making games exclusive. RDR2 is the latest example. Not to mention PC sales doubling once it was available on steam. Which shows gaming companies that there's a large portion of people willing to wait, to have their game on a desired platform.

And let's just make the assumption that it wasn't dick pills or contaminated supplements. Let's say he took some gear in the off season for whatever reason, help recovery let's say. By the time he's back in the cage, there's nothing there. I can guarantee you inject some Tren and pop some halotestin for a month then hop in the cage right away, the fighter is going to be on a different level. 

Its silly to me because most people that have an opinion on this mattter have never taken any type of anabolic in their life, but seem to have a complete understanding of its effects by reading a wiki.

And yes, this generation did very well. But you need to factor in the different technologies that have come out in recent years, Steam Link for example, is one of those approaches allowing people to play video games, at significantly better settings and frame rates. Or some people straight up build a smaller PC strictly for couch gaming. 

The discounts you get are also better on the games themselves. You can run an operating system and programs. No monthly subscriptions. The list goes on.  

I understand you're statement, but the fact is, console gaming is already obsolete. And will be more so as the years go on. MS and Sony know this and are probably already making plans for some type of transition. Exclusive games will only get you so far."

askcarsales,ff1t4la,t3_eqyhdw,1579485589.0,"It sucks that we reference reliability from manufacturers from vehicles built as far back as the 90s. Domestic makes were at one point bad, when compared to German or Japanese brands. It's so silly to me to compare the reputation of a brand from 10-20 year old technology. 

When I need to know about reliability, I go to the back and speak with my techs. They're the ones working on this equipment. They also understand the engineering better. 

This is what it comes down too. If you do regular maintenance, let your vehicle circulate a bit after turning it over, drive like a normal person, it's going to last. As some people have mentioned, knowing the history plays a large roll. Doesn't mean lemons don't exist, because they do. I learned one thing since selling cars, people have had a bad experience with all brands, regardless of domestic or import. 

In your case, the 3.6 is a solid engine. If you happen to have the 5.7, it's also been doing good in recent years. The fact you have no payments, will get you further. Open up an account, every paycheck, deposit 10-15$ in that account. Over time you'll have a nice little source of funding for any maintenance on your vehicle.
