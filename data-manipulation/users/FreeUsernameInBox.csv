It's also supposed to be Juliett, rather than Juliet, because speakers of some languages will drop the final 't' and reduce clarity."
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fgeyxff,t1_fgey6pl,1580715781.0,"I think I normally got through about three-quarters of a tank a week, so presumably a 55 litre tank."
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fgdejpl,t1_fgcl6rr,1580681662.0,"Used to be a weekly job when I drove 100 miles a day. Put in 40 litres of diesel, four of screenwash. Invariably at 6am on a Monday morning because I couldn't be bothered on Sunday night."
RoomPorn,ffxh8xc,t1_ffxgksn,1580325105.0,"In these cases, they have escape breathing aids *as well*. Due to the nature of the environment, overkill is merely adequate."
RoomPorn,ffxetdy,t1_ffx9tbn,1580323698.0,"The systems I'm familiar with use premixed compressed gas that pretty comprehensively displaces the existing atmosphere in the space, but the same basic principle. Usually about 13%-14% oxygen and some clever stuff around the nitrogen/carbon dioxide ratio tricks the respiratory system into using a higher proportion of the available oxygen."
RoomPorn,ffx6red,t1_ffx64cr,1580318929.0,"There are inert gas systems that allow you to continue breathing normally. I don't fully understand *how*, but apparently if you play with the gas mix there can be enough oxygen to keep a human functioning but not enough to burn."
todayilearned,ffnk4r0,t1_ffmeiv4,1580067031.0,"My last company was an engineering firm with a large operational site. They built a new office block at that site for about 250 engineers and the same number of support staff.

Only after they had built the building did they ask how many people would need a locker and what needed to go in it. The answers were 'most of the engineers, who need boots, jacket, hard hat, overalls, and room for it all to dry.'

We did not get that. The architects had no idea nobody could need that much locker space."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffn6ugl,t1_ffn4xet,1580062574.0,"That formula doesn't give maintenance calories. It gives basal metabolic rate, which is a totally different thing.
Even a pot plant has a (very low) basal metabolic rate - it's what's required to keep your body temperature up, heart and lungs working, and all that other good stuff."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffn5d7f,t1_ffm6r9s,1580062184.0,"I'm convinced that exercising has a positive effect on diet. I'm not sure *why*, but I feel like I eat less at meal times and am less inclined to snack when I'm physically active.

And that applies day-to-day as well as over long periods. Get a lift to work? There goes a bacon roll. Walk in? Nah, I've had breakfast already."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffn40gl,t1_ffn160q,1580061823.0,"Is your job description 'coma patient'?

If not, at some point in the day you get out of bed and do stuff. Any amount of doing stuff burns calories above your BMR, which is purely the calories required to keep your biological functions going.

I burn calories at a similar rate to you, on a rather heavier build, just by cooking dinner, taking the bins out and so forth. If I stopped eating like a fat bastard, I'd soon stop *being* a fat bastard."
modeltrains,ffhpwzp,t3_etlccb,1579947615.0,Sounds like you produced a 1:87 version of the Quintinshill Disaster!
modeltrains,ffezhvn,t3_et8gxs,1579871364.0,Are you trying to suggest that trains aren't a necessity?
modeltrains,ff79blq,t3_eqzspm,1579643744.0,"Those are biomass hoppers rather than oil tanks.

Also, I'm envious of your 12 inches:1 foot layout."
MilitaryPorn,fex4sm5,t1_fet7spf,1579424358.0,"Nah, we have that - the Security Service. For some reason they're really keen that people call them MI5...."
coolguides,fem65te,t1_felincw,1579241136.0,"I mean, not too far from how chemotherapy works. Administer the right poisons, and it kills the cancer faster than it kills the patient."
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fedzitp,t1_fedj6wt,1579023179.0,"Probably - takes up to 3 days for delays to work their way out of the system, what with knock-on effects."
modeltrains,fdvbyh5,t1_fdry5o6,1578745862.0,"In German practice, the equivalent of a UK guards van or a US caboose goes straight behind the locomotive. Looks like some BR 50 locomotives experimented with putting it in the tender instead - presumably less coal & water capacity, but allows an extra wagon."
modeltrains,fdv5ci9,t1_fdraqe3,1578743364.0,"Annoyingly, my local train shop (also UK) used to stock almost exclusively US and European N gauge stuff. Then it closed, and now I don't have one nearby at all."
todayilearned,fds7dyy,t1_fdrwpn8,1578696028.0,"Exactly this. In the UK at least, you can't legally give someone medication unless you're medically qualified. They have to ask for it themselves and take it themselves."
todayilearned,fdr9pqh,t1_fdr8yq9,1578681473.0,"I used to be a lifeguard/first aider in the UK. We were not allowed to administer any kind of drug, at all, ever.

As in, if a child was having an asthma attack, we couldn't get them their prescribed inhaler to use. The most we could do would be to get them and their bag in the same place so they could get their own drugs."
technicallythetruth,fdpwo5x,t1_fdovvv2,1578643628.0,"Apparently something like 99% of Americans have never tasted blackcurrants, not even as a flavouring. Growing them was illegal in the US until relatively recently, thanks to a plant disease that can spread from blackcurrant bushes, so they've never had the presence in the US that they do in Europe."
worldbuilding,fdosda8,t1_fdos54d,1578611807.0,Wind is a bit more difficult because it's directional. The movement cost is high in one direction (upwind) and low in another (downwind). I suspect that's quite challenging to implement.
worldbuilding,fdolr7y,t1_fdoleis,1578607718.0,"Probably a more complex job, but if you could combine it with traffic flow estimating you could develop a road system. The network that best serves towns A, B and C may not be direct routes between all three, after all."
todayilearned,fdol40p,t1_fdo59zh,1578607333.0,"A rock cake underneath his heart will knock him down, but a stale pork pie in the eye to finish him off."
worldbuilding,fdoiu82,t3_ema5pi,1578606021.0,"Probably more use for *land* routes, especially if you can weight cost of movement in each cell according to terrain type."
AdviceAnimals,fdogpvi,t1_fdo3y62,1578604799.0,"Streaky bacon is fine, and much preferable to back bacon for many things. Streaky bacon cooked to a crisp and served on its own alongside sausages, eggs and beans is an abomination. I don't even like to imagine it in a roll."
AdviceAnimals,fdnqu5c,t1_fdnaj0v,1578591071.0,"An American friend is convinced that vegan bacon is pretty good. But then, American bacon is also awful, so I have a theory that it's developed for the American market who don't know what they're missing with real, British bacon.

Imported from Denmark, obviously."
castles,fdczdos,t1_fdc9g0y,1578288903.0,"Yes, the photo is Eilean Donan.

Castle Aargh is Castle Stalker, though. In that case, no bridge, and the castle is much less complex."
