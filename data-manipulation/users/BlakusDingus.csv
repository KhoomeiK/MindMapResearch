bodyweightfitness,fcijls3,t3_eh7flg,1577663643.0,"Being fit doesnt make you rich. Being fit doesnt make you not have problems. Being fit is not magical armor for mental health issues and suicidal thoughts. 

Some of the past months have been the worst in my life and dont get me wrong. The idea of not existing has been a very, very pleasant idea at times. 

I was lucky enough to find one of my best friends after he decided to end his existence with a 12 gauge shotgun under his chin. It doesnt leave you. I'll never forgive him for what he did because I was the last one who saw him. I cant let someone find me like that. I will never leave that burden on someone.

As far as depression and whatnot sometimes I feel great after a workout, but the bad thoughts of my situation still linger and they dont go away. I lost my wife to schizophrenia and Inam in tears every time my son has to go see her without me. My business has tanked from a catastrophic equipment failure and I have no clue how to recover. But guess what, that doesnt mean I get to wallow in despair. I need to get up and keep pushing, because that is what the fuck I have to do even if it sucks and I dont want to do anything.
