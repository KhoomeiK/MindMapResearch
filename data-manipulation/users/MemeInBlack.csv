datacurator,fd5rkm1,t1_fd5ilvr,1578180695.0,"Personally I find that characters in the date or time are unnecessary. For example, instead of 2020-01-04, I use 20200104. Then my filenames all contain YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS. 20200104-183912 is pretty clear that it's January 4, 2020 at 6:39 PM (and 12 seconds).

I mostly generate photographs, so my usual format is <camera model>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.<ext>, and files are grouped into folders by date. A photo taken with a Nikon D800, for example, would be at documents/photos/2020/0104/D800-20200104-183912.NEF. Lightroom will automatically rename and sort photos upon import, so it's a pretty transparent workflow. Adding tags with Lightroom then lets me find photos quickly, although I can usually remember the date for photos I want anyway. So far I've got about 3TB of photos/videos, and it's still working well."
