askscience,fecvcm6,t3_eo8zzj,1578986093.0,"I can't talk about every material but I can talk about steel.

Steel is often touted as 'infinitely recyclable' and it can be recycled many times, but there are some limits. When we melt steel down again, we use oxygen to remove alloys such as aluminium, manganese, silicon and carbon so that we get a basic steel chemistry (about 0.1% carbon, silicon and manganese - depending on the aim alloy being made), then we add alloys back in. However, some elements cannot be removed with oxygen, because iron has a higher affinity for oxygen than these elements. These elements are usually copper, nickel, molybdenum and chromium\* and are often grouped together as 'residuals'. Because these elements can't be removed with oxygen, they will gradually build up in the steel as it is recycled again and again. This is problematic because whilst small amounts of these residual elements can be beneficial, large amounts are deleterious to the steel. Many applications requiring high cold-work and good surface finish have specifications that are low in copper, for example. The only way to balance out the increasing concentration of residuals is to dilute the recycled steel with raw iron that is naturally residual-free, usually in the form of pig iron (from a blast furnace) or direct-reduced iron.

\*Chromium in small amounts can be burnt out at high temperatures, with the liberal application of oxygen and quicklime."
aviation,fec7v6t,t1_fec0llh,1578968169.0,"The engine is similar to the turbofans hanging off the wings of just about every large commercial airliner in service today. Combustion takes place in a fairly small core section of the engine and most of that energy drives the big fan at the front. The air from the fan gets blown around the core (no combustion) but is the source of most of the thrust. The Harrier engine has a similar construction, just a smaller front fan and the cold bypass air gets blown through the front nozzles."

australia,fdulmt4,t3_emo61q,1578734881.0,"Another thing for visitors: be aware of how specific weather patterns affect fires. What happens during our really-hot-weather cycles is that a huge amount of heat builds in the interior of the country, which is then dragged across the coast by a cold front. Specifically on the east coast, the bad days are when moderate to strong north to north-westerly winds are forecast, because those winds are bringing the hot, dry air straight out of the middle of the country. These winds will tend to push 'fingers' of fire towards the coast (as I heard an RFS incident controller describe it). 

The same weather system that's causing the hot north-westerlies will then bring a cool southerly change through that's often got stronger, more gusty winds - if you're using a weather app that graphs the temperature, this can be seen as a very sudden drop in temperature coinciding with the wind direction shifting to the south. **This may cause extremely dangerous fire weather** because the winds that were blowing a thin stream of fire south and east will now be blowing across the fire, turning that thin stream of fire into a very broad, north-moving front and pushing that front into unburnt areas that may have seemed safe earlier. The behaviour of the northern end of the Currowan fire on the 4th of January is a very good example of this."

AskReddit,fdq03rw,t3_emk2ld,1578648234.0,"My parents live on the northern boundary of the New South Wales South Coast (north and east of Nowra for those who know the area). On Dec 20th, shortly after the whole country had the hottest day ever a day after the previous hottest day ever, a southerly pushed the Currowan Fire north in a real hurry, so that by Christmas, the northern fire front was level with Nowra. For the first time ever since moving to where they are (\~25 years ago), my parents got ready to evacuate their place after having ash fall on their property. On top of that, everything was really brown at their place (because of no rain) and their water tank (55,000L or 14,530 Gal) was under half-full and going down steadily.

Most of Christmas was spent looking at the weather forecast, particularly for New Year's Eve, and my brother and I each took back some irreplaceable items (wedding photos, old letters etc). My father and I attended a briefing to the community from the Rural Fire Service (which is the volunteer organisation that looks after non-urban fires - Fire & Rescue work in the cities). That meeting was packed to the rafters. The RFS said that they'd try to hold the Currowan Fire to the south bank of the Shoalhaven River bu they said that if it jumped, it would be really difficult to control. They said that this fire season was the worst in memory.

New Year's Eve passed OK for my parents, but the Currowan burned right to the south bank of the Shoalhaven. By the time the next hot north-westerly/southerly cold front passed through on the 4th Jan, the Currowan fire had jumped the river and the north-westerly winds were pushing it towards my parents. They evacuated to a friend's place on the coast on midday that day. Shortly after they left, they got a text from the RFS telling them to evacuate.

The southerly arrived earlier than expected that day and the fire raced north - it covered 20km in 8 hours or less. This spared my parent's place, so they went back the next day to find their place covered in ash, and a voicemail from the RFS left the previous afternoon telling them to evacuate.

Other than that, they've also had to cancel a trip to see a friend in Victoria (the state to the south) because they weren't sure if the route they wanted to take would've been cut off by fire."
