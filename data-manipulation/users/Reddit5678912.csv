RedDeadOnline,ffe7mg7,t1_ffdt13a,1579838880.0,At least we can sleep well at night knowing they‚Äôve made multi millions on us and the game plays like it‚Äôs made by 10 college kids living off ramen packets in a damp basement

funny,ffe4j0o,t1_ffdcap1,1579836498.0,"So they just have 85 million socks littering the floor because they can‚Äôt bend down to pick them up. Plus balancing on one foot for 3 seconds to stuff your toe in a weird contraption seems like a recipe for an elderly person to fall over. 

I‚Äôm sure sitting down is way easier to take you socks off in general and then you get the plus of not having to bend way down to pick them up."

Ghosts,ff6v856,t3_erot8n,1579635572.0,The white thing looks like a spider on a spider web dangling. Wind hits the place and the spider starts to sway and the leaf blows across the floor and the blown over shovel knocks over the other thing in a chain reaction. Wind
Ghosts,ff6pxy7,t1_ff5h2go,1579632432.0,I‚Äôm more aware of shadows then you are. If I take a flashlight point it at my hand it doesn‚Äôt shade against the ground it shades against what‚Äôs behind it like say a cloud of dust. It doesn‚Äôt need a wall and doesn‚Äôt connect along the ground. The actual footage shows that the figure is very very dim which is a wash out effect of light scattering around the room from multiple light sources. There could easily be a shadow on the floor but since the room has multiple light sources the connected floor shadow can be washed out. Don‚Äôt get so fooled by the enhanced footage. Things get even more obscure when you do that. The original footage is the best reference and to be honest it‚Äôs not a very good one. It looks exactly like a shadow of a guy in the party walking.
RedDeadOnline,ff6pccr,t1_ff5xa2s,1579632074.0,"If their server can let‚Äôs say as an example only handle 50k people and then let‚Äôs say there was 150k players logging in during the moonshiner release and because xmas noobs then that means the server was overloaded by 100k and couldn‚Äôt handle animal spawns due to the influx of people. 

The game clearly took a shit and died from all the extra players. People like me said this is unplayable and disgraceful so we left the game. Now that all these people said see later douche bag r* and don‚Äôt log on the system can handle animal spawns again. 

This has nothing to do with lobby size."
granturismo,ff6ofwf,t3_ert9z0,1579631531.0,Nice! I got some $50k car. You did great!!
Ghosts,ff5glmn,t1_ff5fep0,1579591963.0,Well I see it as the person to the left of the camera man matching the shadow perfectly. Right as he walks through the door so does the figure. Pretty big coincidence to me. And the shadow casts on all the dust and not on the floor because the dust cloud blocks the ground. It‚Äôs not a big stretch of imagination to see this as true so I‚Äôm leaning towards that.
granturismo,ff5gelw,t1_ff5g61n,1579591723.0,That‚Äôs a hard no for me. I tried a little bit of PC2 and thought it felt off. I like AC for a hardcore sim but GTS is my fav for racing. I like being creative in GTS for offline. You can make your own events btw. Gr3 or 1 on any track etc any amount of laps etc etc. Lots of options of anything really

gaming,ff5dnp0,t3_erfkuf,1579588511.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs also because there are 100x more men then women that play. Make your own games waman and stop ruining ours. FFS it‚Äôs annoying seeing a random frail, high pitched cunt in every game now a days.

MechanicAdvice,ff5dbus,t3_erdip4,1579588148.0,"Just buy some exhaust sealer. It‚Äôs at any auto store. Way cheaper then a shop. A shop charges $140 for labor an hour and then materials/parts. They‚Äôll do a big job of cutting it or welding it or telling you to buy all new piping. If you want to do a great job then be ready to spend $300-500 here I‚Äôd guess. Or drive in ask for an estimate. Show this picture. Maybe they can do it for $80 depends on city. 

If you want the cheapest route buy a couple sealers and it would almost definitely fix it for a long long time. If it cracks just add more. I think they‚Äôre around $20 or so. You might need 2-4 depending on the size they sell. Easy DIY job could save you hundreds."
gaming,ff5cx3c,t3_erlkc9,1579587705.0,It‚Äôs awesome. You can run away from that shit stain property since it‚Äôs a mobile system.
Ghosts,ff5cbpm,t3_erhq7i,1579587070.0,Oh shit I just realized it could just be your friends shadow from a second flashlight which seems to be behind you. It is almost exactly in sync with when your friend walks through the door. All the heavy dust could be what the shallow falls on. Just coincidence the shadow falls on a cloud next to an opening for air and dust to collect at. Just my best debunking effort. Anyone got a better one? And I‚Äôm not interested in sarcasm or hate. You have your opinions I have mine let‚Äôs work together.

They are the ones that keep the portal open. Their magic is beyond my grasp of understanding and power. 

I‚Äôm an earthly witch and have decided to use my mundain magic to grant new parents wishes. 

Today one parent wished to see another planet. I think I‚Äôm going to send him through the portal. He won‚Äôt last more then a day on the planet. The planet is called THKMI. It‚Äôs an alien language translated. It means nothing to us humans.

RedDeadOnline,fefrg6n,t1_feexc39,1579063039.0,"It‚Äôs common opinion by the masses. So... to the masses you look dumb. To yourself you see whatever you want. 76 is and was beyond broken and RDO is currently broken too. Hence the comparison. What a dweeby fan boy if I say so myself. I personally don‚Äôt care for people that stick up for awful games with awful development and get quick rich schemes which is a plague inside the gaming world currently. You feed the plague with self righteous views that no one can complain about online grindfests that aren‚Äôt reliable due to broken development and neglectful companies. The masses suffer and are being scammed thinking their product holds the value they advertise. A broken game has very little value to the majority of people. You are in the minority. Deal with it. Don‚Äôt act like you deserve a fake pat on the head by everyone that you interact with. If you like the game then learn to understand why other people don‚Äôt like it. Your double standard on opinions is obnoxious. If you don‚Äôt like seeing complaints don‚Äôt read it. If you don‚Äôt like interacting with people that call you out, don‚Äôt reply.

Remember also that they never fixed gta v server issues it just works well now because not many people play it anymore because it‚Äôs such an ancient game. 

It‚Äôll be the same fix for RDO. It‚Äôll self fix once tons of people drop the game like I have. I‚Äôm just here for the dumpster fire and cool pics."

RedDeadOnline,fecwu7i,t3_eog9h4,1578987805.0,"I‚Äôm sure the issue fixes it self since tons of players have stopped logging into red dead. So many people have left the game. I used to have a 28 day log-in streak but now I haven‚Äôt even played in the past 3 weeks. I‚Äôm not supporting rockstar anymore basically. Good for me I know thanks I‚Äôm a real bad ass. 

First it was endless server issues for gta v on 360. Then gtav on xbone was loaded with errors and now same issue on rdo. They clearly dont care so guess what neither do I. They wait for the player base to die off instead of upping their servers. 

It‚Äôs just a weak hunting simulator anyway. The missions online are trash and grinding out boring fetch missions feels dated af. No thanks you guys yawn. I‚Äôll play single player if I ever feel like killing a squirrel again."
