We need an easy exchange like Coinbase to get it into people's hands.

We need a tool like Purse.io as an alternative to Coinbase for those who don't want crypto directly linked to a debit card.

And we need a storefront that accepts it or cash, but with a certain discount for using DGB that will make the head ache of first time adoption worth it.

What would be an interesting idea is a classifieds ad site that only uses DGB so all users can help to promote adoption by selling their unneeded gear. And it would be interesting if it could have some layer where you could buy pre-paid shipping labels with it as well. Create a 100% dgb system as a proof of concept.
