collapse,fgfhe2k,t1_fgf4gmh,1580738791.0,"Lincoln's inaugural speech after his reelection in the midst of the Civil War is etched in the north interior wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.

That speech literally and specifically addresses slavery as the main issue that caused and drove the Civil War.

The Lincoln Memorial has been standing for over 100 years.

I don't know how you can get any more consistent with a historical message like that. How does anyone argue over the cause of the Civil War when the contemporaries of the time address the point specifically and then etch those words in stone over 100 years ago for all to see?"

Too many business owners mistakenly believe they can treat legal issues like you can treat business issues: by either winging it on their own or faking it until they make it.

They don't realize there are often boolean conditions for winning and losing legal disputes, and charisma alone isn't going to get you anywhere you want to go.

kansascity,ff66l2j,t1_ff59u0f,1579620361.0,"The charge was for possession of cannabis in excess of 100g. Client was friends of a friend, so I knew the guy personally.

Client drove a few times each year to Denver to pick up a large supply of goodies. He figured quarterly trips buying a large supply would be less risky than monthly trips buying smaller quantities.

Young guy, no previous criminal record, caught in possession of cannabis.

Prosecutor charged him with intent to distribute, which they had no evidence to support and would not have been possible to prove according to the jury instructions for the offence.

He spent 2 years on probation, did some community service, and paid a fine. Now that everything is complete, the felony isn't even on his record.

While on probation, he met a girl. They are raising a kid now, and he has a solid job.

Your comments make you sound like you're on the warpath to lump everyone into one group and punish them all aggressively for the actions of one individual."
kansascity,ff58bmf,t1_ff53303,1579583212.0,"I appreciate your post.

Am lawyer. Had a client charge with a Class B felony in Jackson County. 5 years minimum imprisonment, according to statute. Prosecutor agrees to 3 years SIS (24 months for compliance). Client accepts. Judge accepts. Client never sees bars.

Happens all the time, and for justifiable reasons.

Edit: further info. The charge was for possession of cannabis in excess of 100g. This was before Missouri modified its criminal code and reduced the seriousness of cannabis crimes.

No jail was the right call. Only an evil person would want to send someone to prison for the mere possession of a qp for personal use."

Of all the parents, teachers, administrators, and advisors who had a hand in this process, your comment places the blame on the youngest and least experienced person involved as though this whole thing was his fault.

He didn't create the academic program for zoology. He didn't employ an industry of people to push zoology as a university major.

This dude was just a kid who had a passion for a animals and rightfully pursued further knowledge in that field of study.

Propaganda leads us to believe that when there is an entire system in place before he got there, it's somehow his fault for the outcome.

That's like saying despite the existence of the entire movie industry--with writers, actors, producers, directors, and marketers--it's somehow your fault if a movie is bad and you didn't feel like you got your money's worth."

I already have my JD, and I applied to a PhD program a couple years ago.

Despite having a GPA and GRE scores higher than the median applicant, the feedback I received stated that my career experience was a detriment to my application. The program chose to select applicants with no professional career experience.

I spoke with another professor in a different department, who spent 10 years away from academia to work for Disney and a few other major industry players before returning to academia.  He said despite having more publications than his peers, he still receives condescending treatment from other professors for his practical experience. They call him ""a practitioner,"" as though the term is some sort of pejorative."

Says who? Where is this 'apparent'?

Besides, think about this from the other side. Even assuming you are required to post these notices, how would the state or federal government received notice that you don't have these notices posted?

Even if these posters were mandatory for you specifically, if you don't have employees, how do you anticipate being found out? Who's going to turn you in? You don't have any employees."
todayilearned,femu8ym,t1_femszi2,1579269747.0,"What is math all about at the PhD level?

All of my experience with math involves using it as a tool to solve a particular real life problem.

Algebra for simple-ish things like fixed and variable costs calculations.

Calculus for calculating rates of change or volume of a product's container bottle.

Linear algebra and matrices for things like measuring vehicle traffic through an area in a city.

Not to mention all of the physics and engineering applications.

But all of these things are learned as an undergrad or master's student.

asklaw,fe050es,t3_enfwir,1578803227.0,"I think you have the process backwards.

The hiring process consists entirely of an investigation that is seeking a reason to not hire you to be a police officer. All the tests, interviews, exams, background checks, etc. are all searching for something [anything] to indicate you won't be a good fit for law enforcement.

So it isn't a matter of proving you're sane. It's a matter of whether they find evidence of your mental illness.

If you're really mental ill but still are able to pass all of the tests without detection, then you'll be hired because they didn't find any evidence of a disqualifying mental illness."

Economics,fd3u3pg,t1_fd34zrf,1578161676.0,"It was Congress who created this.

26 U.S.C. § 170(h) is the federal statute that allows for conservation easement deductions.

Not all of these types of deductions are fraudulent. Certainly, there is a lot of potential for abuse when the IRS's ability to audit these transactions is so limited.

But abolishing this section of the tax code would create an additional administrative burden on the government and to the individuals who give their individual property rights to the federal government (conservation easement).

The current statute (§ 170(h)) allows for a way to compensate these individuals for the forfeiture of their property rights, compensation that is required by the US Constitution.

Without this statute, the government will need to develop a new department to handle these transactions, which will waste more resources than just supporting the currently underfunded department already tasked with overseeing these matters.

The best answer is to give the IRS more resources to audit and punish improper or fraudulent conservation easement deductions.

But eliminating the deduction statute will just create bigger problems and waste more resources for everyone involved.
