nihilism,ffu4ru6,t3_ev3wnd,1580234478.0,"Who's to say that if we found an ""answer"" to the nature of life and existence that it would bring ""meaning""? What if it doesn't bring meaning or even has the opposite effect and induces more suffering?

 A quote by Lovecraft, 

 ""The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents... some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new Dark Age."""
nihilism,fdeb8kf,t1_fdbkzpc,1578335232.0,"I would argue that optimistic nihilism doesn't make sense. Optimism, pessimism, and really any other philosophy or belief isn't consistent with nihilism. A nihilist rejects all beliefs and meaning, so how can a nihilist empower themselves through optimism to find meaning and happiness? I think that ""optimistic nihilism"" is just existentialism or something else entirely"
nihilism,fcwrh7u,t3_eiwl1a,1578034688.0,"I would describe nihilism as a state rather than a belief or philosophy. The state that one finds themselves in when they reject all beliefs and morals in the realization that life in it's entirety is meaningless and futile. By being in a nihilist state one does not believe anything, nor are they creating any subjective meaning or reason"
nihilism,fbx2j0y,t3_eev3kk,1577166796.0,Meaning is just a delusionary coping mechanism that we use to try and justify our existence. Its the product of the human mind and therefore doesn't exist objectively.
