DoesAnybodyElse,ffqhjlj,t3_eujbo6,1580134775.0,I've been like this since I was younger when my mom attempted suicide and I was like 14 my aunt really wanted me to come spend the night at her house but all I wanted to do was go home familiar and process things my way and I think that's because my mom really didn't so a lot of sympathy sometimes or interest and helping me deal with things because she had so much on her plate Nobody's Perfect so in time I just preferred my own way as opposed to feeling disappointed or hurt we're trying to get help

I might be a little bit of a control freak. Beat anxiety
AskMen,ffqgq3g,t1_ffqcte6,1580134101.0,Does this affect your relationship in your feelings towards her? Or intimacy? Because I think that's a barrier for me I honestly can't even get in the mood when all I can think about is how little effort summer and is willing to put in when I am stress and my love language is doing things and gifts so it's important that I see a true effort to go at least meet me in the middle some days above and beyond. I have to give them credit she's slowly catching on but it's just probably going to plateau and someone told me you can't raise a man if his momma couldn't do it and I'm starting to see that
AskMen,ffqgl4f,t1_ffqcrjk,1580133986.0,I don't even think he has any AB strength when he gets up it's a struggle and when he sits down he's literally just drops all his weight and she said a lot when I asked him to get up it takes minute to go from laying down two standing.

AskMen,ffqggjk,t1_ffqb974,1580133879.0,Right? I have a really hard time not taking it as a direct disrespectful and insulting the lack of care and I give so much more than I get. Like the other night I wanted to go to the ER and he didn't even want to come because he would sleepy. He just missed my legitimate fears about a prior stalker cyberstalking me that Androids and walked away but this does not registered to him as rude or callus he thinks he was trying to assure me that security updates have fixed these issues but I don't think she should get how knowledgeable Tech guys are I mean out of a friend that barely went to school and he can make his own OS phone and I've known guys with no formal training that learn how to code programs and use them maliciously but dismissing my fears as if they're unnecessary is it comforting just dismissive
AskMen,ffqg8qq,t1_ffqcrlo,1580133695.0,I find myself intervening a lot when I see things being done in an inefficient or unacceptable way and I don't mean to take away the opportunity for someone to help I would just rather they follow my wishes and pick up the pace
AskMen,ffqg62x,t1_ffqbk9n,1580133631.0,I wish all men were like that I used to be in a really bad place with mental health and addiction and I didn't take very good care of an evening I put in a lot of work to learn how to handle my life and it's very stressful to have a grown ass man that isn't raised and needs constant prompts that stole don't work. I wish you was buying that things are easier if you take care of things as you go and following a system of where you keep things and organize your stuff makes life so much less stressful.

badwomensanatomy,ffqfsci,t1_ffg5yvc,1580133306.0,I am willing to bet the majority of women who actively chose to become single mothers we're actually not contributing to these issues that Opie implies are a collection of failures. I do agree that poverty and lack of Education can certain factors are bad for children but as long as children have a loving support system I don't see why single moms are a problem and why is there no focus on deadbeat dads
badwomensanatomy,ffqfmxp,t3_etfv0c,1580133177.0,Or perhaps sexism and gender roles that imply women should be having children and playing a domestic role I'm more responsible for girls choosing 2 start a family with men who are not compatible

badwomensanatomy,ffqffxk,t3_etkl13,1580133009.0,Finally I seen post like this on Facebook where men so are extremely triggered insisting that women should be responsible for this and they're entitled for even wishing that this were available but I think if we're not going to provide Sanitary products for women's involuntary discharge of Blood and Tissue then perhaps all people should have to provide their own toilet paper in public restrooms and while we're at it we might as well not give them a sink or so soap
badwomensanatomy,ffqfc0d,t3_etl1lt,1580132913.0,It's actually more of a sociological issue but go off about the supposed gay Evolution for population control. I choose to believe that people are becoming more responsible for their impact on the planet and putting more thought into a serious Choice such as to bring another life to this Earth and that doesn't just go for the homosexual couples. More and more people are choosing not to have biological children. Perhaps there is a biological component or somehow we are aware our genes are not ideal but I also think that's more likely just self-doubt and put Downs added up
badwomensanatomy,ffqf5cj,t3_etjvqd,1580132755.0,Actually that's it's pretty Universal as long as you don't use a fast charger an older Android it used to be a problem but science fix it the part that plugs into your phone literally just carries the current that the charger says and the part that goes into wall is technically a female part so I guess if you want to compare vaginas to a phone and Chargers you're bugging a big dick and a little dick into two ports and somehow that means anything about the phone pass I guess the phone would it have a battery and that battery would be the closest thing do kegels if you want to argue that the wrong charger cord is going to weaken the vaginas

We had sort of a bonding my birth was high risk and emergency C-section I suffered from colic and my mom had PPD and openly admits to thoughts of throwing me out the window. Family members have told me that she screamed at me when I resent it and called me a b****. It took a lot of scientific explanation and personal growth to wash it all the way and accept it for what it is I've just decided not to pass on these jeans and this trauma with the new knowledge they have about how your eggs are affected when your mom is inside of your grandma and certain hormones and neurochemicals can affect how our brains work before work even fertilized or conceived. It's actually some interesting stuff how do genes get switched on and off and how some of it has nothing to do our life on Earth

A weird part of me doesn't like to admit this because I feel like I'm betraying my mom but she was very emotionally abusive as well as physical and she ignored my knee and punish me with withdrawal. She had me when she was 23 and her dad got sick so she had it rough then my uncle attempted suicide and survived with the pretty bad TBI so she was a caretaker for all of us and I think she just snapped lately though she's been a woman woman I don't know if it was menopause or Miracle but she's just not the person she was when she hurt me"

I first was diagnosed and I was in a support group. AMD a girl who knew told a girl in my group and people were 'whispering' about it before the facilitator took over. That was embarrassing but also angering. Like, why is that pertinent to anybody that isn't um...acquainted with me or aware of my full name or anything. This girl was 18 and very immature and kept laughing and looking at me while she told the others. I was surprised they shrugged her off and kinda just didn't show a neg reaction.
