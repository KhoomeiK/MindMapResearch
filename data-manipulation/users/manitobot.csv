Economics,ff6pz1y,t3_erre7p,1579632451.0,"What is incredible is the fact that even after they lost everything when Idi Amin expelled them, many people still missed Uganda and would move back when the government invited them too."
neoliberal,ff6obd4,t3_ervi07,1579631456.0,I want this decade of National Populism to end in 2020.
ABCDesis,ff5fktz,t3_ernoyj,1579590703.0,I am at a loss for words. It's unspeakable.

TheGoodPlace,ff0d5kt,t3_eqxfwb,1579467769.0,Tiya Sircar has always been a relatively small role actress; I really would love if the Good Place was her breakout role into the limelight.

ABCDesis,few1wpf,t3_eqjqwa,1579404329.0,It’s just semantics.
neoliberal,fevxsni,t3_eql69s,1579402871.0,"When I was little I used to think Indians looked different to other Asians because our dark skin came from continental drift away from Africa.

Oh to be young."
atheism,feu9lle,t1_fetrhpe,1579384489.0,"I would argue it’s a violation of the First Amendment to pass laws favoring the use of prayer. Even if the prayer is NDM, it still is many cases government funds or government oversight for a designated prayer time which involves the institution of religion."
atheism,fepuwxx,t1_feourxe,1579332179.0,But this isn’t a matter of sports or academics. We don’t pray better or worse. It seems like a mechanism that just promotes divisiveness among children.

atheism,feoigxx,t3_eq0r23,1579300626.0,"There are many arguments regarding school prayer, but it’s this quote from the West Wing that I find to be the most apt:

Toby: But I'll tell you why [School Prayer] should be front and center. It's not the first amendment, it's not religious freedom, it's not church and state, it's not... abstract...

Leo: What is it?

Toby: It's the fourth grader who gets his ass kicked at recess 'cause he sat out the voluntary prayer in homeroom. It's another way of making kids different from other kids when they're required by law to be there. That’s why you want it front and center; fourth grader; that's the prize."
FragileWhiteRedditor,feohlxt,t3_epwo0t,1579300310.0,Why is black history consigned to a month? Black history is American history.

neoliberal,femwsuz,t3_epyad4,1579271661.0,We don’t destroy cultures; we actually assimilate. Historically that has always been the case. The Volga Germans of Russia loved being Russian. The Zoroastrians of India were thankful to be Indian.
neoliberal,fem7jx0,t3_eptk7i,1579242590.0,"The democratic socialist wanted democratic socialist policies. Who would have thought.

This goes out to all people who think he is just actually socially democratic. No, I think he is sincerely democratic socialist, proposing socially democratic policies, while mischaracterizing it as Scandinavia’s welfare state."

Thanks."

HistoryMemes,feh52z5,t3_ep3qqx,1579109313.0,"To all the detractors, I have to say the meme is accurate because of the fact that there was certain apathy in Churchills War Cabinet towards the famine until 1944, when aid was finally provided."
