Yeah, I feel like standards are higher if you're bigger, too? Like there's the kind of careful ""I just rolled out of bed"" look that's very popular, but I don't think a bigger person could pull it off without scrutiny. Dressing body types is a good idea...I feel like high-waisted looks good on most people, though it can be hard to find high-waisted items that both fit well and aren't incredibly short. I'm not very happy with my upper arms either, but I really like my shoulders, which is a tough balance, aha! Writing stuff down like this is a really nice idea.

I don't wear accessories hardly at all, haha. I've been meaning too, but when I'm going to class I typically stumble into some clothes and roll out the door--even if I get home by noon, I typically just work the rest of the day. It's probably worth dressing up a bit for myself, though. I have some nice bracelets at least, though I'd have to get used to the feeling of anything around my neck.

I honestly donít think itís as bad as everyone made it out to be though. It was just kind of Cats the musical but worse. Kinda struck me as lazy reporting with everyone hopping on the bandwagon, as well as just people not liking concentrated musical theater (which is pretty much what Cats is; itís all spectacle and dancing).

EDIT: to clarify, a lot of the critique towards Cats was inherited from the original musicalóthe movie was almost too accurate in those respects, since movie critics just REALLY didnít like how musical theater it was. The rest of the complaints were about the CGI, which is valid, but honestly it looked fine sometimes and I got over it a few minutes into the movie. Some more valid complaints (keeping in mind the source material) are that they did a few of the songs dirty and didnít alter the source material enough, to make it work better as a movie.

I think massively expanding the collectibles (fish/insects/etc) and making them more nuanced as far as time of day/weather would help a lot. And crafting should probably have some kind of catalog as well, to mark what you have and haven't crafted?

I think this is one area in which cooking would actually work out REALLY nicely, since you would gather ingredients to cook and give as gifts to townspeople. And since those would be given away as frequently as possible, you'd always be searching for new food to make for your villager friends.

EDIT: to clarify, a lot of the critique towards Cats was inherited from the original musical‚Äîthe movie was almost too accurate in those respects, since movie critics just REALLY didn‚Äôt like how musical theater it was. The rest of the complaints were about the CGI, which is valid, but honestly it looked fine sometimes and I got over it a few minutes into the movie.

I think this is one area in which cooking would actually work out REALLY nicely, since you would gather ingredients to cook and give as gifts to townspeople.

badwomensanatomy,fdyu0sf,t1_fdxjohn,1578783560.0,"Swear to god, if you're not wearing literally red lipstick, people think you're not wearing makeup lmao

I never wear it (I don't get any enjoyment out of it) but that just makes me ""ugly"""
books,fdw71s4,t3_en5uar,1578755748.0,"For me, I just prefer illustrated covers. Even if it were just how the book originally was, with a photo on front, I don't like it much...it interferes with my own imagining while reading the book in a way that illustrated covers don't."
menwritingwomen,fdvvx8m,t1_fdvqldj,1578752203.0,"I think the main issue is that very, very few authors (if any) would write this scene with a man. I think there's a place for sexual scenes, but after cleaning up a gory terrible wound isn't one of them. It mostly reads like the author was horny and wanted to shove something in before the next scene.

It kind of follows the larger trend of not letting women in media react appropriately to situations because they need to be the sexy one, all the time."
DesignMyRoom,fdsckmw,t1_fds9klo,1578699523.0,"If I was feeling really funky I might try some colored window blinds, though it might be tricky to match to your room. But it'd definitely add a nice pop of color."
menwritingwomen,fdsag1q,t1_fdsa542,1578698083.0,"I understand people can have a spread of strengths/weaknesses, but so many authors ppl love show up on this sub and I have to wonder...How are they so stupid about women and yet manage to make award winning books???????

Well, I guess that‚Äôs a lot of history, now that I think about it."
cats,fds9u8o,t3_emyq33,1578697677.0,"For your last question: make them both indoor cats. Jerry will need to adjust, but it‚Äôs the best for his health to avoid cars, poison, rabies, and so on., as well as to protect the local population of vulnerable native birds, reptiles, and others. It might be worth attempting to introduce the cats (slowly!!!) according to cat introduction guides online and see how well it goes."
DesignMyRoom,fds9cdr,t3_emyrpc,1578697344.0,I think it‚Äôs fine. Curtains might make it feel unbalanced. Maybe put some little plants on the ledge?
pointlesslygendered,fds0ut9,t3_empeel,1578692514.0,"We should all make our own personal STEM acronym.  A STEMsona if you will. Eating rings true to me because I love food lets go

Aquariums,fdp9y63,t3_emkd9l,1578623436.0,"Googled around a bit and it seems like ‚ÄúTuxedo‚Äù guppies just kind of do that. Fin rot is much less uniform and ‚Äúclean‚Äù, and body rot typically doesn‚Äôt happen until the fins are like all gone"
