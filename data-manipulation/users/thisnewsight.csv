nfl,fcpor9n,t3_eic32w,1577868878.0,"Watching “The 2 Bills” on ESPN+ changed my views of how important coaching is. I mean, I’ve always thought it was important but DAYUM, listening to Belichick and Parcells... 

Parcells was a great coach, what made him fantastic in HIS opinion was that he fielded the best OC and DC (Belichick). Parcells was just the shotcaller and had the final say. Belichick totally deferred to him but they definitely had some shouting matches in the office. 

Belichick is the opposite. Belichick gives zero fucks and is severely cut-throat. He runs the entire show from top to bottom and has it to a point where it’s such a well oiled machine. For example when he left the Jets to coach the Patriots, the Patriots still had a core of “Parcell boys” that Parcells and Belichick adored (McGinest, Bruschi, etc). It gives him tremendous advantage over coaches who don’t have the chance to develop their roster and improve the team incrementally. 

We will rarely ever know the full dynamic that goes on in every NFL office. I am a believer of giving a coach 5-10 years. 7 years is when an entire roster is yours, on average. So, 7 years would be good for every new coach unless there has been catastrophic seasons (as we clearly see with Browns, for example)"
