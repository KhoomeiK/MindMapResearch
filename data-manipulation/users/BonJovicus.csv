CFB,few5btr,t1_feuvhjr,1579405628.0,">If you were writing 10 years ago, you could use Clemson as an example of a program that could never advance beyond their few ranked seasons. 

Clemson is a historical top-25 team in college football's heartland that had a fairly recent national championship even before Dabo: they were really only missing a great coach. I get that they weren't great then, but it still highlights the point that only a handful of programs have the fundamental basis to even sniff a natty. 

That is not to say that mid-level P5's can't have great seasons, but only the usual suspects are going to be able to win at the highest level. Honestly, in some ways I wonder if the playoff has made it much harder for the mid-level P5's. I don't doubt that teams like Wisconsin or Stanford, which have been good but not great, could get lucky enough to convincingly win their conferences...but I can't ever see them winning the two games, likely against bluebloods or traditional powers, to win a natty."

CFB,fdn14uc,t1_fdmudhq,1578574069.0,"I like the idea of tiers here, but there are a lot of weird choices here, especially with how highly you are rating some of the B1G teams (e.g. I don't doubt Minnesota and Iowa will be good, but their chances aren't the same as Notre Dame, Texas, and FSU). 

Straight up, I think the tier categories should be:

Tier 1: Blue Bloods or historical powers (all time T-25) that are currently very good and have made the playoff multiple times or won the natty recently 

Tier 2: Blue Bloods that are down and need a good coach, historically good programs with good coaches that are currently winning a lot

Tier 3: Historically good programs with unproven coaches"

Its probably true that while A&M probably might do a little better had they stayed in the Big 12, the on-field results stay mostly the same. In the endless pissing contest that is being a sportsfan, 8-5 probably feels better when you can brag about how much money your school is making while riding on the coattails of your conference champion, I suppose.

>from a fan stand point, Saturday’s are so much more entertaining now. Big 12 stadiums are frankly pretty dead and that is obvious even on TV and it really impacts the game atmosphere.

Not sure about this one, but maybe that's because it is subjective. As someone who has been to at least one away game @ every team, I just don't feel the stadium experience at the large public schools in the Big 12 is that different from the gameday experience at the large public schools in the SEC."

It got lost in the noise of the preseason, but Baylor was a Big 12 dark horse in the early offseason. They were on a good trend with a returning upperclassman QB. Also wasn't Rhule in communication with the Jets at one point? Minimally he knew the NFL was an option and that his stock would still rise with a solid year.

Programs like OU don't rebuild. Also I think they reload harder now that transferring is becoming more common. 

That said, people do need to appreciate that Riley has kept OU at the level they should be at for three years now. Maybe we can't say just how good Riley is because of the inherent advantages at OU, but he isn't Clay Helton, who is clearly boosted by the prestige of his program.
