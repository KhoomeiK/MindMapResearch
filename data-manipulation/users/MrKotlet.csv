aww,fg0obdg,t1_fg0my5v,1580411827.0,"They don't need to be. You're literally discriminating against a dog breed and saying they have violence coded into their DNA just because they ""look like pit bulls"", where pit bull isn't even a dog breed but like 8 different breeds... And I'm not saying it's literal racism you doofus, that's why I said it's. ***like*** racism ***for dogs*** - similar, not the same."

aww,fg0f61z,t1_fg0dzrs,1580406513.0,"Lmao well done on completely missing my entire point. Dog breeds have been bred to do some stuff, true, but that's not the only breeding that occurs in pitbulls, and we (almost entirely) stopped breeding pitbulls for fighting long ago.  And I'm not confusing dogs for people, I'm just treating animals as animals, and you should too. And you might want to practice your reading comprehension a bit too, as I not once compared PoC to dogs or any type of animal. So nice try trying to turn my words around to try to make me seem racust to further spread your movement. Very mature. All I meant is that your stupid ideology has *many* parallels to actual racism, such as discriminating against dogs due to appearance (as again - pit bull isn't a breed) and the eugenicist idea that they are born with bad behaviour coded into their genes."
