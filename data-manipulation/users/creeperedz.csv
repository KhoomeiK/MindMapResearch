WhitePeopleTwitter,ffr0dl8,t1_ffqz5i0,1580147686.0,"While you're correct about potential harm during childbirth (which only would occur if the woman delivered vaginally and had a current outbreak) it doesn't typically interfere with any kind of functioning past the initial outbreak. 

The fact that you're referring to them as ""the mouth kind"" and the ""genital kind"" is ignorant. HSV1 and HSV2 are the two strains of the virus. Both can present orally or on the genital/peri-anal area however HSV1 has a strong preference for the oral region and HSV2 has a strong preference for the genital region. A person can have either or both types and never have signs. Someone can have both types and have signs. Both types of sores and typically painful and distressing for a person to experience. 

About 2/3 of people with either virus don't get any kind of symptoms. Some only experience them once and some get persistent outbreaks that require therapeutic intervention. The virus is only potentially harmful in the immunocompromised and an otherwise healthy individual is able to manage the virus with every day life. 

>The mouth kind rarely results in cold sores

While this is not true I understand your thinking. A lot of people get OHSV1 in childhood and as time goes on your immune system gets better and better at preventing outbreaks which is why many adults no longer get ""cold sores"" but however can still pass along the virus through asymptomatic shedding. 


The most ""dangerous"" things about herpes is the ignorance around it (so many asymptomatic people pass it on without knowing) and the stigma that comes with a diagnosis. If you go to any herpes subreddit you'll find a common theme is that more damage is done to a person's mental health from the diagnosis than what the sores physically do. Plus, there is no worse kind, what's ""worse"" is subjective to the individuals personal experience."

Talk about her boundaries and express your feelings. See what she can do to put your worries to rest. Take time. Start from the very basics until you feel comfortable again. But reassure her it's not because you're less attracted to her. I think that's key too."

ShaneDawson,fejpcss,t1_fejp5w0,1579182369.0,">Once again, comparing specific words to darlin, which is in my speech here at home on a regular bases, and is affectionate to those words used, is asinine. 

>One person said, ""I hope it's not permanent"", so yes, right right, that does deserve being called a cunt, silly me for calling them an imbecile, or having an opinion that the tattoo is complete shite. Then having said person say I'm sensitive, and need thicker skin, yet said person is going to each person who also isn't a fan of a tattoo, attacking and insulting them. But I'm the sensitive one. 

>Nope, my word is not law, my opinion however, is allowed here. It's the internet, People are going to give their opinion, and if someone is going to retaliate by insulting someone with a misogynistic word, then guess what? I'm going to point it out. You think you're right, I think I'm right, so instead of this drawn out whinefest, how about we agree to disagree. I know it's difficult for Shane stans to let go, and not attack those who but I believe you can do it!

One word: whinefest"
fatlogic,fejocd7,t1_feizaxv,1579181524.0,Spot on. I'd love to hear their rebuttle to your comment.
ShaneDawson,fejo9v0,t1_fejnmik,1579181466.0,"I haven't been hypocritical at all. My stance has remained the same. Plus you definitely didn't mean it affectionately considering you already started name calling and insulting OPs tattoo in the first place. 

They aren't to you and you think your definition is the law so there was really no point in even trying to explain this to you in the first place. You're opinion is a word is misogynistic, ours is that it's not. You don't like OPs tattoo, we think it's dope. Get over it. Put your energy into something positive next time."
fatlogic,fejnwsx,t3_epekuo,1579181152.0,I think they all need a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. Honestly. They're so far up themselves they'll never find their way out and die in there.

ShaneDawson,fehotz0,t1_feho9cv,1579120894.0,"We're both women and neither of us is being misogynistic. Just because that what you think of the word doesn't mean that's what it means to us. 
Some people think it's ok to us the N word, others don't. But I'm not gonna go around and be the word police because it's something I don't say. It's not a shit insult it's a funny one. 

>not everyone on here is from another country

You're literally not making sense. That's the point I was making. Calling a man or a woman a cunt means the exact same as calling a man or a woman a dick, here, where we live. Equality. OP is using it in the context they normally use it in. 
Definitions don't revolve around your opinion get over yourself and while you're at it go get your skin thickened a wee bit you must be freezing."

fatlogic,fegtijs,t1_fegsy1x,1579102184.0,"If they can show someone who is their size at their level then they can safely instruct them. And there are people who are overweight who would feel more comfortable with an instructor that they don't find intimidating. 
They also might find it more motivating and see that exercise is a realistic activity for them of they see someone their size doing it. There's a market for it. 
Exercise is adaptable. A language isn't. So this isn't a good comparison to make."

fatlogic,feg4ojs,t1_fefvm7y,1579076768.0,See that's exactly what they should do. They can still do their job just not in the same way. There was an overweight instructor at my old gym and she just taught regular classes and was very motivational as an instructor but my problem was she couldn't demonstrate exercises properly. She could barely do a squat but assign jump squats. Couldn't do a full press up even on her knees. Like how can people learn good form if they don't see it and the instructor probably isn't even aware their form is bad.
AmItheAsshole,feg0c1a,t3_eoq0fz,1579071546.0,"YTA with a little E S H. Yes your kids should be allowed to go out and have fun at reasonable hours but they also live in the neighborhood and deserve peace and quiet. You're probably just happy they're outside making noise and not inside bothering you.

Parents will always defend their kids actions when they don't think anything a wrong. En example of this is when our neighbours kicked the wing mirror off my dad's car with a football, lied about it and then their parents defended them saying my parents shouldn't park their car IN THEIR OWN DRIVEWAY. They only suck a bit because if there's a park nearby they should expect noise from children. 

Plus I'm getting kind of sick of this whole ""boomers had it easy therefore I deserve to live here more"" vibe you've got going on. You both bought houses there fair and square. Don't be bitter because times have changed and owning a property is harder now. They faced different challenges back then that you don't have to worry about now. You really do seem like a complete A with how you're coming across."
