I know these are just technicalities, but I think they should apologize to Qing/China for invading, then apologize to Taiwan for the poor treatment of the people (though it gradually got better and Taiwan would not be nearly as prosperous today if it wasn't for the Japanese.) My point is... it's pretty complicated, not saying that they're angels but technically they never ""invaded"" Taiwan."

But on the other hand, I know conductors who have to study with a ""system"", and perhaps for OP, this system involves coloring.

For example, I was taught that you start with the form when you study and you start the formal analysis with phrases. I still mark phrases on my scores, even when the structure is crystal clear. Marking them, for me, is now just second nature and I don't really think about phrases unless they are super complicated득ut I still mark them as I study through the piece. It's just my system."

People often talk about having to show up in court after an accident듈 don't know why people often do this. I've been in accidents before and perhaps had to fight against a ticket or two before, but if we're talking about civil courts, even for more serious accidents, the insurance companies will fight it for you. Is it really that common that people have to show up in court themselves to fight insurance companies?"

For people with long commutes, good seats, good entertainment systems, good assisted/auto-driving capabilities, etc, are all important. A BMW might not be inherently better, but a car better in those functions will most probably be much more expensive than a base-Hyundai, whether it's a higher trim or from a more ""luxury"" line or manufacturer.

I used to have a 200-mile roundtrip commute I had to do twice a week. When my Corolla was in the shop a while back, I got an ~~Accura~~ Acura rental. ~~It's not even a luxury brand~~ but being a loaded model and a newer year model, it made the commute so much easier.

So my point is, it's a really good deal. If you're not happy with the performance, it's mostly WearOS and the chip's fault, not the Fossil Sport. Even if you shell out another $200, the experience won't be significantly better. Just so you know where to set your expectations :)"

classicalmusic,ff1mi4o,t1_ff16qeu,1579481635.0,"I see it both ways.

1. BSO's management dug the hole themselves. A 16 million deficit is absurdly high.
2. On the other hand, the cultural and educational contribution of an orchestra to its community is far beyond the concert-attending demography. Having a major symphony in town could have a significant impact on the community. Everywhere else (other than the USA), the governments are normally heavily involved in maintaining funding for museums, orchestras, opera houses, art galleries, etc. The public funding for arts is abysmally low here in the States. No reason not to raise that to closer to what other developed nations are doing."

verizon,fezk48a,t1_fezgmbz,1579458187.0,"Also depending on whether you need a lot of data. $40 for peace of mind would be worth it. $40 for a mere 2 GB of data (500 MB a day) is very expensive for very little allowance. When I was there last year, I used an 8 euro data-only plan on Wind/Tre that has 30 GB allowance. It's a monthly no-contract plan. Find something like this, you will have days wasted but it is still much cheaper than $40. 

So... if he needs a lot of data, I'd say go with a local sim. If he wants to save money, go with a local sim. But he's only visiting for a few days, so if data isn't too limiting to him and the cost isn't too prohibitive, the ease of getting Verizon's plan might be worth the $40."

I'm no expert but I have a friend who works in the industry. He's with Sprint, not Verizon so take it as you will... For them, if a request is put in for a rural area, after a while (might be a few months, might be years) they might decide on whether to actually put a tower there. If they actually plan on doing that, there will be another year or two to wait as they clear their queue.

I'd say find another carrier if it Verizon doesn't work for you듧ong story short, it will be very difficult to get them to build a tower.

classicalmusic,fezaakc,t3_equhcl,1579455290.0,"> If it is a symphonic work, encore will rarely be asked but always played. (It can either be a movement previously played or a piece that the conductor had prepared for the occasion) 

I replied above but felt that this question could use a discussion.

I don't know what kind of concerts you're talking about, but ""encore will rarely be asked but always played"" is something I've never experienced. I'm on staff with a major US symphony and we almost never play an orchestral encore. I also lived/studied in Europe and Asia드nd professional orchestras there are mostly the same (even though I know I'm generalizing.)

Unless you're talking about pops concerts or community orchestras, which do perform encores from time to time, I would just like to point out that what you described is not the norm."
classicalmusic,fez8xsk,t1_fez2hsr,1579454948.0,">they're somewhat less rare if an orchestra is on tour I think. Especially on tour abroad.

Not who you're replying to, but this.

When we're on tour, we are the ""guest soloist"", so to speak. We always have encores on tour because people are there to see us. When we're doing a subscription, we never do an encore.

And to answer OP r/BWV001's question:

* Regarding orchestral encores, professional orchestras almost never play orchestral encores. The incident you spoke of, it was most probably not ignored by the conductor듈'm sure he or she appreciated that. But if nothing's planned, nothing will be played.
* Soloist encore: most of the time, soloists will have a few possible options ready, but they are also very aware that orchestras have very strict schedules. As the soloist plays his or her encore, the orchestra's clock is still ticking. Orchestras will account for possible solo encores, but when they know they have a strict schedule, they will let the soloist know. They might not tell the soloist ""absolutely no encore"", but they will ask them to play a short one if needed.

Anecdote: there was one time when our ops told a soloist ""strictly one encore"". The soloist did two. She was very apologetic coming back, saying that the audience clearly wanted more and she gave in. She paid out-of-pocket for our overtime."
