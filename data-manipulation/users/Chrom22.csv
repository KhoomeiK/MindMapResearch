facepalm,ffccptb,t1_ffccfsp,1579796621.0,"Just to clarify. I'm chinese as well, just not from mainland china. I'm not trying to be racist against my own race; neither am I affected by whatever Reddit thinks of the Hong Kong situation. The problem lies with the culture and attitude that mainland Chinese grew up with, not the race in itself."
facepalm,ffc9jrw,t1_ffc8z0q,1579794631.0,"I'm not an American. I'm Asian and have been to the slightly rural parts of China before. There honestly isn't a difference in behavior between the rich and the poor. Hell, even my tour guide was complaining to us about how the majority of the locals had a lack of manners, and was talking about how he himself hated to bring chinese tour groups around.

I've never been to America before, so I don't really understand how tourists are being treated in New York. However, yes, most tourists would judge the overall hospitality of Americans based on their initial impressions of how they were being treated. Of course, this isn't a fair comparison in any sense, but this is just how the world works."
facepalm,ffc8mkb,t1_ffc6zt3,1579794042.0,"Disagree. It isn't just the wealthy that acts this way. Mainland Chinese people are known to be very rude and insensitive towards others. They don't care where they are; be it locally or when travelling abroad, their behavior stays the same regardless."

ClashRoyale,fd2nuox,t1_fd2knzb,1578149877.0,"Hmm. Let me rephrase. Perhaps they should have taken the nerf in another direction. For instance, many people are calling for a nerf to the number of bats spawned, which I agree with. The main reason why night witch is so strong now its not because of its fast initial bats spawn speed, rather its due to the death bats spawn and its insane dps. Nerfing the night witch in other areas would be a better move, rather than nerfing its initial bats spawn speed and attack, which literally no one had asked for."
