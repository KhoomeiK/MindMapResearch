coffeemeetsbagel,ffzq17v,t1_ffzijrh,1580389490.0,I wish I could express in words the pain of being born in such a time where love is both abundant and hard to come by.

UncensoredAsian,ffwr226,t3_evl43m,1580308942.0,Hey our outfits match!
condomcollections,ffwlh1c,t3_ethf6u,1580304703.0,I enjoy condom collections but it’s kinda conflicting for me because I also think there’s nothing better than creampies.
asianhomemadexxx,ffwkg4t,t3_euov4o,1580303858.0,Haha the guy is moaning too! I love it. Thought he came in her for a second.
SuicideWatch,ffvyf9h,t1_ffuoros,1580277192.0,"This is where I am now, and I hardly know what’s going on anymore. Everything feels so numb. I even have suicidal thoughts and continue to research and plan my suicide even when I’m feeling good. I just want to turn the game console off, not because I’m too weak to continue, but because I never wanted to play in the first place."
SuicideWatch,ffv6sxo,t1_fft5nuu,1580257048.0,"But everyone says someone will appear when you don’t seek them. 

Lonely folks are trapped in this advice cycle that leads nowhere."
SuicideWatch,ffv6oh3,t1_fftyxwb,1580256962.0,"That’s what I’m so afraid of. I’m afraid of being 53, single, alone, and nothing has changed despite all my efforts. That alone makes me want to kill myself even more."
insertions,ffstbgz,t3_ev0zcc,1580191691.0,Pretty cool. You should try writing your signature with your pussy. It’d be a kegal document.
SuicideWatch,ffsrzk3,t3_euywws,1580190331.0,"You’re right, it is emotional hijacking; we need more reasons to live for ourselves, not just others. Your feelings are valid. 

But you’re wrong in that it won’t affect people, or that your decisions don’t impact those around you. You’re a node, you don’t exist in a vacuum. You may not care either, which is understandable. You can be pushed to such a point to where the pain is so unbearable that you don’t care how other people are effected by it, and it’s okay to feel that way. 

But it will effect them. Like a limb lost, the host yearns for its existence once again; a phantom pain. A pain where something should exist, but doesn’t. 

I had planned to jump off a parking garage. I walked by it about an hour ago to examine how high the top is to the ground. I’m still alive right now. There must be something better here for ourselves. Let’s not quit just yet."
