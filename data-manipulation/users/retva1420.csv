dogswithjobs,feigwxv,t1_feic157,1579138264.0,"What a superb explanation! I learned so much more than I already know from working with border collies! I work for a Canada goose management company and we use highly trained border collies to flush the geese off of client properties. We have a huge problem with geese where I live -- they have adapted to winter over in our climate, which is cooler than what they used to migrate to. We now have resident goose populations, which are compounded by the migratory birds that do fly threw twice a year. 
So, thanks again for sharing your insight!"

dogswithjobs,fdbhhlx,t1_fbj53ar,1578257472.0,"Excellent suggestion about volunteering in an animal shelter. I don't think there's anything much more rewarding than working with dogs or cats that are lonely and starving for attention and affection. Shelter caretakers can only do so much -- they can't love on each animal in their care for extended periods of time each day. My municipal shelter relies on a big contingent of volunteers to help with providing the attention and love that keeps the animals sane and adoptable despite their confinement. The rewards are endless; the love these animals give is without measure and is a surefire way to enhance your  self worth. Hang in there -- despite the dark times, you have to look for the light."
