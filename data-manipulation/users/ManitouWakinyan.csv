That seems like pretty good motovation to get moving in the moment. Luke isn't put in a life or death situation. 

Rey's arc isn't about learning to rely on others - you might like that arc better, but it doesn't mean an arc aboit finding her place in the galaxy and learning to overcome trauma isn't a logical and valid plotline. As for the powerful force user thing, we've got Anakin using the force to be the only human pod racer in the universe at the age of 11, an untrained infant is able to heal with no training, and we frankly never get an indication throughout the whole franchise of how long it takes to learn a mind trick, or if thats even a technique you need to be taught. There's nothing illogical about particularly powerful users of the force being able to instinctively use it, or to get access to deeper mysteries in the force relatively quickly through the study of primordial texts.  

As for Poe, he's obviously still reckless in ROTS, but people don't pull complete 180s overnight. There's definite progression in his leadership throughout, and by the end of the film, his hubris is gone. 

Finn: I don't see him gleefully gunning down Stormtroopers at any point. And while he didn't have a ton of otuse, he and Rose pulled the thematic weight in TLJ. 

Ren: At no point was he Palpatines bitch. Rey even accuses him of this, and he directly refutes her and says he's pulling a long con. In TLJ, he was absolutely close to redemption (closer at least than Vader was when Luke showed up on his ship). That's what that whole throne room scene is about - they're both feeling the pull, and they're both stuck somewhere in the middle before they stumble back to their respective sides, dark and light.

Flags like Maryland and California don't break all the rules, but the excellence of their design in general allows them to be evocative and resonant despite being complicated.

Like I said, you can break the rules very successfully.  But that doesnt mean the rules are totally useless or invalid. And the way this flag breaks the rules isn't successful in the way other violations of the rules are. But I repeat myself."
vexillology,feoabwv,t1_feo6fnm,1579297270.0,"The New York flag is a bad flag, and that's perfectly consistent with self-identity. The point of a flag is to resonant with it's constituent population. The lack of recognizability in the New York State flag (which is, in part, a product of it's over-complicated nature and similarity to most other state flags) has contributed to it's inability to serve as a resonant state symbol with most of the population. You don't exactly see businesses and people all over the state using the flag. It's pretty restricted to government buildings. 

Compare that to the flag of DC, which is everywhere - and very simple, and very recongizable. Or compare it to California, which is not very simple, but is very recognizable, and has a good enough design that it breaks the rules well. It's a bit like writing. e.e. cummings breaks all the rules, but he knows what rules he's breaking and why. But of course there are plenty of terrible writers who are breaking the rules, and their writing suffers for it. Just because e.e. cummings is successful with his writing doesn't mean that eliminating capital letters makes your writing successful."

vexillology,feo95z8,t1_fentah1,1579296742.0,"A design is effective if it accomplishes it's objectives. For a flag, that objective generally includes recognizability at a distance and emotional resonance. The ""rules"" of flag design are helpful insofar as they help accomplish those objectives. You have very clear exceptions to the rule. As you point out, they're guidelines. The Venetian flag manages to be recognizable and evocative and aesthetically pleasing even while breaking the ""rules."" California is another good example. You haven't quite achieved that here (and I say this as an Anishnaabe person). There's a good concept here, but it could use some work - a different fire design would help the whole flag look like a more unified design, and be more recognizable at different sizes. As it is, the flag looks a little messy and doesn't focus well. 

Obviously, no one here is your supervisor. But if you don't want feedback, or you just want praise, take your flag off reddit, print it out, and stick it on your mirror. You won't have to worry about what anyone thinks that way. But if you do want to share your flag, I'm not sure why you wouldn't take feedback, or even criticism."
