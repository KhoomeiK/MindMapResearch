The trestle is about a half mile long, end to end with little 'side out' platforms every couple of hundred feet for someone who might be caught up there.

One of the town drunks on a bender decided to try and traverse the length of the track on a moonless night.  I guess he was with a group of friends who dared him to do it.  Well of course, he's about a quarter of the way out there and a train shows up on the far end of the track.  He starts high tailing it back to his starting point, loses his footing and falls.  After falling 70 feet, he lands squarely on a sleeping cow.  His friends are amazed and freaking out when he promptly gets up and walks away from the cow he just killed.

sailing,ff14nn9,t3_er31bo,1579475140.0,"Teak is amazing.  I've refinished bright work on dozens of boats.  I always grin when an owner tells me that he/she thinks that the teak needs to be replaced.  I'm like, ""Are you aware of the price of teak?""

An aside note.  I have charged wealthy owners the going rate for teak replacement (toe rails, deck), but I have this little gold mine of Indonesian teak tucked away in a storage locker.  I met a gentleman about 10 years ago when I was on a search to replace the toe rail on my '65 Rawson 30.  I was told by an old sailing salt that, ""He's the guy you want to go see.""  I rang him up and he told me to come on by.  I get to his house, he opens up his garage and he's got over 40 slabs of teak all stacked up with spacers in between them, taking up his whole garage.  They're 4"" thick slabs by 3ft  x 8ft.  Each weighed about 400+ pounds.  My jaw dropped.  The price per slab?  $600 USD.  I bought one on the spot.  I then asked him if it was all for sale.....""yep!""  I asked him where he got them.  He said that his father was a merchant marine that did multiple trips to Indonesia in the '50's.  The slabs were used as stacking slats between shipping containers on his ship.  When they unloaded his ship, the slabs were discarded in a pile to be hauled off to the dump.  This guy's father started loading up his truck everyday with these slabs and taking them home.

A few days later, I showed up at this gentleman's home with a sorely scraped together $12,000 and bought half of his stock.  My old salt buddy owns a storage facility, and lets me keep them there for free.  I was able to re-do my toe rail.  I've gone through two of the slabs through working on other people's boats.  I've made my $12,000 investment back.

A few years later, I was passing by a church that was being demolished.  I talked to the site manager and asked if I could make a bid on the mahogany church pews (each being 20ft long).  He said, ""How about $400 a piece?""  I said, ""Make it $300 and we got a deal in cash.....today.""  Another $12,000 and I had 40 mahogany church pews.  I ripped one to insulate and finish the interior of my boat in mahogany.  I've used 3 others in client projects.  The investment has paid for itself.  I'm not a religious sailor, but I feel that I have a little bit of extra protection on my boat when I'm in poor conditions off shore.

So I'm absolutely rich in fine teak and mahogany.  I'm keeping it as my nest egg while the rest of the world decimates the teak and mahogany forests. I've sold both teak and mahogany to friends at cost.  My sailing salt buddy, gets what he needs for the asking.  Funny, I've never told this story before."

widowers,fdd2s93,t3_ekp36x,1578292467.0,"I watched the video from the mark it was set and what I got out of it is, more speculation about what happens after we die.  Gautama Buddha basically said that everything is consciousness.  Before my wife died, she read a book titled Dying To Be Me by Anita Moorjani who was going through stage V cancer, had an amazing NDE, regained consciousness and soon thereafter became cancer free (this has been medically documented).  My wife believed that multiple planes of existence/reality inhabit the space we experience in 'life' and that death allows us access to other planes of reality.  My wife also believed that when we dream, we access other planes of reality.

Me?  I'm the kind of, ""I gotta see for myself"" type of person, so I don't think the question will be answered 'til I take the leap.  Being a Zen Buddhist, keeping an open beginners mind, I just don't know.  My belief though, is that there are other worlds/planes of existence beyond this empirical one and that there will come a time when my wife and I will come together again.

I did enjoy Hoffman's idea that curiosity and 'the search' is endless.  It reminds me of the Freeman Dyson book I read called Infinite In All Directions.  Meaning infinite in the macro and micro search of a 'fundamental' reality.

Thanks for the link and your thoughts.  I wish I could be less wishy washy in my response."
widowers,fdcxzmp,t1_fcy7zsi,1578287646.0,"I'm really glad to read this.  It seems to me that one of the major topics around this sub is the topic of our loss and grief being misunderstood by those who haven't experienced our 'flavor' of it.  Someone that's curious or just passing through, may learn a thing or two about people who are grieving and how to interact with us.  In essence, I see our sub as a possible educational lesson too and I'm for keeping it open just on that reason alone, but for other reasons too which have been stated above."

AskReddit,fdctzxp,t3_eklsip,1578284269.0,"This was a long long time ago.  Back before the beginning of time........

When I was 5 my mom and dad separated before divorcing.  About two days post separation, Dallas moved into the house.  He was all smiles, full of laughter and jokes.  Didn't really interact with me much.  He had a couple of months previously, come back from a tour of Vietnam where he witnessed and created hell.  He wasn't just little kid thinking adult's are big, big.  He was big.  6'2"" and ripped.  The guy moved around like a wild caged animal.  He was unemployed so he was home all the time (while my mother worked), which meant I spent a lot of time with him.  I remember turning on the TV one day to watch Land Of The Giants.  I sat down on the floor, the opening came on and I was suddenly flying through the air and landed on the couch.  Dallas had thrown me across the room.  The landing was a bit rough.   As soon as I realized what happened, Dallas's face filled my field of vision and it was a vision of anger and hate.  He told me that HE was the only one in the house who decides what can be watched on TV and that if I did that again, he'd rip my head off and stab my mom to death.  He grabbed me by my hair and asked me if I understood.  I said 'yes'.  He terrified me, but even at that age, I knew he was mentally ill.

He started making dioramas of war scenes that he had experienced.  I remember him spending days making these things.  One of them I vividly remember.  It was a tank scene with a guys legs on one side of a tank track and his torso on the other.  In the track was a red spot where he got crushed.  Dallas pointed to the scene and told me that if I didn't behave, he would drive a tank through my bedroom while I was asleep, run me over and turn me into a bloody red spot.  I believed him.

He started randomly beating me with a heavy leather belt.  I remember the concussions of each hit taking the breath out of me.  Once he turned me over on his knee, pulled my pants down and told me he was going to cut my ass off with the knife he had in his hand.  I pissed my pants and his knee.  I got hit on the side of the head and was out.  When I came to, he told me that I was going to tell my mom that I fell off my bike in the street and if I didn't, he would stab us both to death and drive a tank through the house and turn us into red spots.

He started hitting my mom, and one day while Dallas was out doing something, my mom packed our shit up and 'poof' we were in an apartment on another side of town.  Dallas tracked us down one night, broke the door down, had a gun in his hand and told my mom to say her goodbye's.  Two L.A. Sheriff's deputies showed up right about then with their guns drawn.  Dallas was taken away in cuffs.  I never saw him again.  

A few months later, I opened up to my mom about the abuse Dallas had inflicted on me for the year he lived with us.  She dismissively said, ""Maybe you were being bad.  Maybe you deserved it.""  Her saying that created a gulf between us.  I never trusted my mom again to this day, and I'm 52 years old now.  War is evil."

widowers,fdc8fgp,t1_fdc1ifg,1578269132.0,"> I think what's killing me is that I have to 'perform' my grief in a certain way for people to believe I still need support. It's so exhausting.

I do wonder how dark the 'black veil' needs to be for society in general (this culture) to realize that we are still grieving.  When do they expect us to take it off?

""Every time someone tells me how strong I am, I feel like another piece of my mental support comes crashing down.""

The unintended consequences of so called 'putting a band aide' on our grief by turning it into a positive (for them to lessen their discomfort of having to acknowledge that we are deeply wounded people).  It's blind blather.  It hurts to hear and it pisses me off when I reflect on it.

One other thing that I have done twice this last week that leaves me disappointed and going ""WTF DEAN!"", is that people have been asking about my life and back round.  When it comes to Rebecca and the narrative ends with her recent death, two people have given me the, ""I'm really sorry to hear that.""   My response?

""It's OK.""  No Dean, it's not fucking 'OK'.  I just want to punch myself in the fucking face when it has slipped.  I think it's born from the shunning I have received by some when they learn that information.  As if my loss is contagious, or they just don't want to expend some sort of self imposed energy to treat me with 'kids gloves' because of the fact.  I'm changing that fucking response.  I find it disrespectful to the love I have for my wife, and the import of losing her.

Navigating grief is not for sissies (something an old salt buddy of mine would say), but then.......what the fuck else are we to do?  Kiss the business end of a shotgun (would never even consider it, but the choice given us seems pretty black and white to me)?  Sorry for the long diatribe.  Putting it 'out there' helps me work through my conundrums."
