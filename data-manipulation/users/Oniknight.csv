They created the definition and the prestige and only extended it to others they considered inferior because they needed the appearance of numbers.

Have you attempted to find social connections outside of the ones you feel you “deserve”?  Part of failure and managing those feelings is also understanding that beating your head against the same window won’t magically get you through it without a lot of pain, suffering, and horrific reactions by the people on the other side of the glass. 

When people narrow their ideas of success down to a very specific set of variables, it means that most people can’t do anything BUT fail, and then they use this as proof that the dream they feel entitled to is being kept from them by people who are maliciously set against them. 

But perhaps, that’s not it. Maybe the thing is that you have a dream that all your problems will be fixed “if I get x  job or y relationship or z group of friends” but then, even if you do, you still feel shitty and alone. This isn’t just failure. It’s a kind of manufactured failure so that a person can then create reasons not to try again and experience failure in other ways. 

This may not apply to you. Perhaps the world truly is against you to a degree. Structural racism, sexism, classism, ableism and even degree-ism are all a big problem in our world. 

But part of being adaptable is to sit back and try to think of how you might take your dream and pull out the essential bits- satisfaction with your career path, being able to care for yourself, a support network that values you, etc, and see if there are different ways to meaningfully meet those goals.

I was also always the same weight/size. I have pcos and endocrine issues. They are genetically determined but you can do various things to mitigate the effects.  

It took me until I was in my 30’s to like salad. Sometimes it takes time and experience to learn how to eat  well. 

Also, there are plenty of people who want you. The question you need to be asking is what you want. 

That’s a much scarier question because to acknowledge what you want is to fear you will not get it and remain eternally unsatisfied. 

However, if you deny what you want, you will still feel denied without it, you just won’t have the ability to articulate it. 

So my advice is to do the hard stuff now. Search yourself. Experiment with what you like. Give yourself the permission to want without limits. 

The good news is that you get to change and grow that definition to mean whatever you want it to mean. 

The bad news is that you will fail sometimes and you will experience pain. 

But that’s life. Even the thinnest most model pretty person will also experience these things. 

The hardest lesson I learned was that usually it’s not my fat that makes people not like me or not find me attractive.  I focused so hard on this one attribute that I used to forget that most people care more about common ground and personality connections. And a lot of people are looking for relationship types that I’m not into.

PCOS,fdepmde,t1_fdel04z,1578343979.0,"You don’t need to have an eating disorder to engage in disordered thinking around food.  This especially counts if you obsess about every gram of carb in public then engage in eating a secret stash of “junk food” or have “binge/cheat days”. These have been normalized in society but they are deeply disordered behaviors, and often disproportionately affect women."

PCOS,fdeaf40,t3_ekw4r6,1578334718.0,"For me, I don’t focus on weight loss. I find joy in food that serves me. Finding delicious low glycemic index foods is part of that. Giving myself smorgasbords of smaller amounts, cleansing the palate with other bites and letting myself have as much as I want (it usually isn’t a lot but it prevents plate loading and eating until overfull). In general, my health has been way better by having healthy habits and being moderately active throughout the day by walking. 

I have found that this has served my health the best over the past decade."

There’s a lot of bad shit that can happen when you burn fat like that, largely because your fat stores are a bit like glaciers that freeze all kinds of bad shit in them. Burn too quickly, and you end up getting weird symptoms. And I literally don’t know anyone who maintained it for over a decade and kept the weight off.

I’ve found that eating at least 6 times a day with a solid protein source and a short walk after eating really helps.  Also, if you are at a job where you sit down most of the day, you may consider requesting a sit stand desk adapter. They’re not very expensive and doctors will often write you a note for work. This way, you can stand or walk in place even if you can’t go out for a walk as often. Regular daily walking a few times a day(at even a modest pace) is a great blood sugar regulator."
