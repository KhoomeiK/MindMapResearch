AskReddit,ffq7p6z,t1_ffq5a3z,1580124837.0,"It's true. I hate walking around in public because if I start to tic then I'm worried people will record me and that's so simple and easy to do. I guess most people would obviously realise that there's something wrong with me, but all you need is that one person to record you. 

I'm also worried about dash cams because if someone drives past me they could record one of my tics and then put it on the internet."
AskReddit,ffpuabb,t3_eujx69,1580105964.0,"I have tourettes. It's actually motor tic disorder which is the same thing, except you don't have vocal tics. 

A few years ago, someone in my class recorded me doing a very, very embarrassing tic. He even recorded my face. I'm terrified that he's gonna post it on the internet and it's gonna ruin my life. People will think I'm odd, I won't get hired, I'll miss opportunities etc because people will recognise me or Google my name and find that video. 

It caused me to develop social anxiety and it's basically destroyed my life for the past 2 years. I haven't been to university because of it. 

I feel like I'm gonna go insane. You know when you see movies of patients in the psych ward in rooms who are bagging on the door and talking nonsense? I feel like I'm gonna end up like that. 

I've been close to suicide, I get periods where I have Insomnia for months and it always feels like my brain is dissolving. It's a living hell. 

I didn't do anything to him and I always tried to be nice to him. I'm always quick to forgive people for whatever they did to me, but I'll never forgive him."
offmychest,ffiwo8v,t3_etvjqy,1579984526.0,"I've had forehead wrinkles since I was a child and I had a teacher that has forehead wrinkles as well. I also have tourettes just like you. It's actually motor tic disorder, but still. 

I know what tourettes does to you. In fact, I've got severe social anxiety and it started because someone recorded my tic. 

I'm sorry you have it as well. It's not pleasant at all. I've hurt my eyes because of tourettes as I had a tic where I was constantly crossing my eyes really hard until my eyes started to hurt. 

I don't really know how to help you with your wrinkles, but I'm sure you'll be fine. 

All the best."
Anxiety,ff7wjmp,t3_es5cnz,1579660050.0,"I used to have this up until I was about 21. I watched a horror movie about mirrors when I was around 9 and from then on I was terrified of mirrors. 

I know what you're going through. I can't really say how to help because I beat my fear by thinking it's irrational and by putting myself in front of a mirror and saying ""If you want me then get me"". 

I also said that if there was  monster or something in the mirror then it would have gotten me all those years ago."
Anxiety,ff6p2gc,t3_erxp35,1579631909.0,"Basically, different SSRIs (sertaline is a type of SSRI) can have different side effects. Sertaline didn't agree with me, but it could be perfect for you. You just need to try it and see. 

Good luck."
Anxiety,fefme3l,t1_fefma2j,1579059454.0,"Yep, running is great. It's hard at first, but stick with it. You'll make great friends, you'll overall fitness will be much better and most of all your anxiety levels WILL go down. 

Good luck."
Anxiety,feflnzn,t1_fefkxga,1579058981.0,"I've been in medication to treat these thoughts and basically it did help, but I'm not too sure anymore. 

I've got therapy at the end of the month so I'll see how that goes. Are you on medication? Have you gotten therapy? 

There may even be breathing exercises to calm down. I've heard that runners out their hands on their heads breathe. This allows there body to calm down. Maybe try doing that?"
Anxiety,fefl5da,t3_eowlqn,1579058654.0,Have you been diagnosed with OCD?
Anxiety,fefl3l8,t3_eowljx,1579058624.0,"Yep, I've been doing the same. It's like I've been living in hell and I've been trying to distract myself by playing video games or whatever. 

I've got therapy at the end of the month and this is something I'm definitely going to mention."
Anxiety,fefkxoz,t3_eowkja,1579058520.0,I was. I'm getting back into it. It's the first time it happened to me and it seems to be a phase.
Anxiety,fefkwd3,t3_eowkz1,1579058498.0,"Wait, so you told the teachers you're not coming in for the whole day? I'm just confused on your wording."
Anxiety,fefksmy,t1_fefki5m,1579058434.0,"Yep, I've had this before. I recommend going to the doctor to get sleeping pills or something similar. I know exactly what you're going through. I've had those kinds thoughts day and night for months at a time."
Anxiety,fefkni2,t3_eovunb,1579058344.0,"Please see your doctor. Maybe you could get some medication to help you sleep. Also, are you on any current medication? How much caffeine do you consume?"
Anxiety,fefkbxb,t3_eowhmk,1579058148.0,Try doing something that can help you call asleep such as reading a book. Don't do anything too stimulating like watching YouTube.
Anxiety,fefk8yz,t3_eowhom,1579058097.0,"Forget online apps. Go join a sports club. I joined a tennis club simply because I wanted to get really good at tennis and I wasn't interested in friends. 

Oddly enough, you bond with everyone before you know it.

N"
Anxiety,fefjtj2,t3_eovynf,1579057831.0,"Yeah, that stuff happens to me, too. I remember reading about it years ago and basically it's a trick of the mind. Even if it did happen then so what? I'm sure it's not something bad."
Anxiety,fefjo42,t3_eow54t,1579057738.0,"I get this too where I'm embarrassed about something I said. My friend once calmed me down when he said that people aren't gonna remember it soon. 

You also made good points in your meeting so you've definitely redeemed yourself. 

Can I ask, do you have social anxiety because I've been diagnosed with that and I get the same thing you do."
Anxiety,fefjgnb,t3_eow7bu,1579057608.0,"We're here for you, OP. You can do this. We've got your back. You will graduate and you will ace those exams. You got this far and you can certainly get much further. 

Deep breaths."
Anxiety,fefiom4,t1_fefi4dk,1579057135.0,You're welcome. If you have any questions at all then let us know. We're always happy to help.
Anxiety,fefflzq,t3_eovunh,1579055299.0,"Basically, your side effect vary. Some antidepressants can give you bad side effects and others will barely give you any, if at all. 

I'm on my 4th one (Fluoxitine /prozac). I've taken Zoloft before and it didn't agree with me, but Fluoxitine is great. 

The one side effect I always noticed was reduced sex drive and it was harder to orgasm. Even if I did orgasm It didn't feel as good. I'm male, btw. 

I definitely recommend taking the antidepressants. It will take some time to see the effects, but it's worth it. Many, many people take antidepressants. They're completely safe."
Anxiety,fefd28e,t3_eovext,1579053700.0,"I've been there. I've had those feelings on and off for them last 17 months. It's absolute hell. You will get through it. Even if it doesn't feel like it you will. 

Honestly, I think I can't get through it whenever it happens, but I always do.

Don't give up. We've got your back. Please get on medication and get therapy if you haven't already. 

All the best."
Anxiety,fef0yon,t3_eosvjc,1579045610.0,Absolutely yes. My therapist asked me about my caffeine consumption during my initial assessment.
Anxiety,fef0sgx,t1_fef00l0,1579045499.0,"Yep, this is true. Wars are now becoming about special forces with advanced technology backing them up. It's also about economic sanctions and cyber warfare. 

War is not the same as it used to be. It's always been changing. Before you could burn down a castle because it was made of wood. They then started making castles out of stone so you couldn't burn them down. After that they used cannons to destroy stone castles. This special forces with advanced technology is simply the new form of warfare."
offmychest,fee4aup,t3_eop14a,1579026104.0,"It's definitely possible. Just because people have mental health issues doesn't mean they can't be successful. All you need to do is Google ""Successful people with mental illness"" and there you go."
Anxiety,fecpfuk,t3_eogr2m,1578979947.0,"I would say any endurance sport that you can easily start doing. For example, you can run. You just need to put your shoes on, go outside and start running. 

You could also do sports that are more intense such as swimming. 

Personally, I play tennis that gets really intense. It's also social. 

Good luck."
Anxiety,fecmbn5,t3_eof0tl,1578977456.0,"Oh yeah, I sort of had this once. I had a computer science class years ago and I was a little behind on this one section of a coding project. My teacher wasn't happy and I could tell she was annoyed. 

Despite having a busy day and it was Friday I got back home at 6PM. I coded from 6PM until 2AM. My family were worried about me not leaving the room and even went to see my to ask if everything is okay because I normally roam around the house like a cat. That's because I'm a heavy procrastinator. 

When I got back to class on Monday, my teacher checked my work (she checked everybody's work that day) and she was shocked. She said I did a lot of work and the more she looked at the work I did, the more her jaw dropped. She was really impressed and I got the impression that she thought I was a hard worker from then on. 

My anxiety would normally be ""at the surface"" meaning that I can feel it which leads me to procrastinate and play video games all day. During this period the anxiety felt like it was internal and forced me to work that much. 

I'm telling you, if all us anxious people can find a way to change our anxiety from procrastinating (or other negative behaviours) into working hard and working constantly then people with anxiety will have an unfair advantage in academics, the workforce etc over people who don't have anxiety. 

I did speak to one other Redditors awhile ago and he does exactly what you do. I wish I could do what you do all the time because I think you basically have a superpower. 

I hope I don't sound like a horrible person saying that anxiety can be a superpower. Anxiety had destroyed me in the last 17 months, but if I can turn it into that hard working attribute then I'll welcome the anxiety with open arms.

Edit: I just read the rest of your question. I got too happy that I rushed in with my answer. 

I don't really hear many people with anxiety do what you do, but that's just my experience. I can't give you any hard evidence of that being the case. 

My only concern is for you not to burn out. Make sure you take care of yourself and do things you find fun, because burn out is not fun."
Anxiety,feckzu3,t3_eofwy2,1578976495.0,"It will, but nobody can have access to it, except medical professionals. In the UK and I think you can request to delete your records, but doctors prefer you not to do so because more information is always better."
Anxiety,feckkf2,t3_eog0y1,1578976181.0,"Same with me. I'm embarrassed about how little I've achieved so far in my life and so I don't want to speak to friends, go to family events or meet new people. 

I said to myself that once I get my life back on track then I'll go out and meet new people, but that's gonna be hard with all this anxiety."
Anxiety,feck3x8,t1_fecjxgz,1578975851.0,You're welcome. Maybe give some to your sister?
Anxiety,fecj9ae,t3_eoftb8,1578975253.0,"This may sound stupid, but what do you think about using that antibacterial hand gel thing? You basically put some in your hands, rub it in and it should kill the germs. 

It's not gonna be as effective as actually washing your hands (otherwise you would use it before performing surgery), but I'm sure it's better than nothing."
