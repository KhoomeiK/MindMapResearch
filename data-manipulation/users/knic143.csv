college,ffqlquf,t3_eugbaq,1580137989.0,"I kinda felt the same way you do now when I was a freshman. I’m in my second semester as a sophomore and just recently changed my major from marketing and management to journalism with a minor in PR. I can tell you from my experience, I joined a community service co-ed frat, and I made a lot of friends in it. I think being so busy with that and kinda being forced to socialize and see more of the city helped me with my funk, so if there’s anything like that or an org that’s around your interest, I recommend trying it out. Sometimes you need a lil something to MAKE you get out of bed. If the work around your classes and major are getting to you really bad, maybe try seeing if your school as a career interest test. That’s one of the reasons I changed my major; I wasn’t happy with my class load and it wasn’t what I thought it would be. So far in this semester I’m already happier with my workload and subjects. It’s perfectly fine to change your mind, and having a career test can help point you in the right direction if you’re feeling iffy. If I’m being honest too, you’re gonna fail more than one exam or assignment. That’s just part of the college experience. Once you get through that first exam and know how to study, it usually gets easier (unless you just don’t study period). Being away from home gets better too once you feel more comfortable in your environment. It just takes some getting used to. If you’re still feeling like you’re in a weird place with it after this semester, or you feel like your funk is getting worse, I would try to reach out to a school therapist or something. They may have a better understanding of how to help or what resources you can use. I hope this helped and I hope your semester gets better. :)"
college,ffgtr6l,t3_etfpv7,1579914841.0,"Start studying 3-4 days before your tests instead of cramming. You’ll remember more info that way. Don’t pull all nighters unless you absolutely have to. Caffeine can help enhance your memory for an extended amount of time after consumption, but don’t consume caffeine late in the day if you have trouble sleeping at night. Take advantage of any school resources offered to you like essay/writing tutorials/meet ups with profs. Use a planner and write out all the important dates like tests so you’ll have plenty of time to prepare. Depending on how you learn, take thorough notes in a journal or laptop; if writing, try color coding or using blue ink pens to distinguish really important info. Use Quizlet. 

I used a lot of these things last semester and I got a 4.0."
AmItheAsshole,fenp609,t3_eq0u3t,1579288809.0,DEF NTA. It’s something that has sentimental value to you and there’s nothing at all weird about it. I’ve got my own worn blue bear and a multicolored spotted dog that I’ve had since I was super little. I’ll be 20 in a couple months and I NEVER plan on getting rid of them. If your partner has a hang up about your Snoopy then maybe they’re the one that’s weird.
AmItheAsshole,feluhsu,t1_felsjua,1579231250.0,"There’s a misinterpretation of my comments then. I was doubling down that people who weren’t using birth control/precautions are trying for a kid, regardless if they confirm or deny they’re “trying”. I don’t, nor do I doubt OP knows, if their parents were or weren’t involved with BC or protection. I’m just saying if they weren’t, regardless of age, they knew the possibility of what would occur."
AmItheAsshole,felnunh,t1_felnjt6,1579226646.0,"It’s possible but it’s typically a very small percentage. You missed the point of my comment though. I was stating that if they WEREN’T USING contraception OR protection, they were TRYING. I wasn’t bringing up the possibility of birth control; I was stating what happens when there’s a lack of it."
AmItheAsshole,felm4ro,t1_fellwbo,1579225464.0,"It doesn’t matter. If you aren’t doing anything to prevent a pregnancy and you’re saying “whatever happens happens,” you’re trying for a baby. You can word it however you please but at the end of the day they’re old enough (and have previous experience) to know how a kid is made and how it can be prevented or not."
Exercise,feli2u8,t3_eps7b9,1579222689.0,"Idk if you’d be interested in it, but for my cardio I always prefer to use a stair master or inclined treadmill. It may be easier on the knees and changing up the speeds and times can give you a solid cardio workout."

It’s a shitty thing to make your kids—ESPECIALLY kids that have major exams coming up and have their own life they’re building—take time out of their schedule/studying for a decision you decided to follow through with and you are old enough to deal with. OP, you are NTA is any way for how you’re feeling."
AmItheAsshole,felf0rl,t1_feknqwe,1579220632.0,"I can tell you from my own parent passing away last year, a parent’s death is VERY different from a girlfriend/boyfriend’s parents’ death. People have other commitments that can be difficult to navigate; certain family members couldn’t attend the funeral for my situation, but I sure didn’t treat them like shit for not making it. In this circumstance, there is no win-win situation. Comparing the two is inappropriate for this. This is a NAH"

Aside from that, just be aware of what you choose to eat, drink plenty of hydrating fluids and GET PLENTY OF SLEEP. I always tend to eat really bad whenever I’m tired."
Exercise,fe6nwib,t3_enxuhd,1578897504.0,"I would def recommend some slides that you wouldn’t mind getting wet by the pool or in the shower (assuming you shower there). That’ll help prevent any gross infections or fungi around your feet. If you like music, bring some earbuds or headphones with you. I know some people can’t get into their cardio without the right stuff playing, but that’s just personal preference. Other than that I think you’re good"

insaneparents,fdcdv6w,t3_ekdri3,1578272492.0,"There was a quote from The Patriot that really stuck with me. It was something along the lines of, “I will not fight. And because I will not fight, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.”

And I really think that that’s something people need to consider heavily, ESPECIALLY with the events that just occurred. So many wars have ended up being unnecessary, and yet so many people have ended up dead or permanently affected. The people that help facilitate those wars don’t seem to be the ones greatly affected by them. I think whoever is in charge when shit really hits the fan needs to consider deeply how this will affect the population, economy, and overall morale of the country. I can tell you now that while I love the freedoms and privileges of being an American, I would loathe serving in the military for a war that could’ve been avoided or at the very least lessened."

Where I’m from we usually go without shoes when around the house, but if we’re just dropping something off only to leave again we keep them on. We always leave super muddy/dusty/dirty shoes outside on the porch until we can clean them though."
