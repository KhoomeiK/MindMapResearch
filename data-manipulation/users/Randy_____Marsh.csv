I kind of sat and wondered what my coworkers and friends were doing on evenings to kill the time when I was at the bar with other coworkers and friends.

The entire Sw/Sh “boycott” is an example of why this is false. People still went out and bought it, GF doesn’t care if its the since Gen1 20 year fan or the 12 year old who just decided to pick it up cause its popular. What matters is the sales numbers."

steelers,fdrqzrq,t1_fdrmhjf,1578688325.0,"Snap counts for the LBs and DL

48-B.Dupree	PIT	LB	997


90-T.Watt	PIT	LB	952


55-D.Bush	PIT	LB	905


26-M.Barron	PIT	LB	766


98-V.Williams	PIT	LB	401

Hargrave played 692 snaps this year

Heyward played 885

Alualu played 440

These do not include special teams snaps per footballoutsiders.com

Edit: something I found interesting is that Barron and Hargrave both have less than 1% special teams snaps, Watt and Dupree are both 13-14% and Heyward is 26%."
