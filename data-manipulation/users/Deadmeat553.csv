No, that isn't what I meant at all. I meant that if you have a partner who wants to be poly, your best options are to either leave them or go with it, not to try to suppress them. Trying to keep it mono with them will just make them unhappy and ultimately ruin the relationship."

That is not what I said. I said they don't need to know or care about the silly details of your life, that frankly most partners will only feign interest in anyways. A romantic partner doesn't need to care that Karen at work keeps stealing your paperclips, nor do you need to care that Kyle at their work started dating the secretary.

If you're not satisfied with that, then idk what the fuck you want. Regardless of what you think, there are real poly people out there who aren't just cheaters in disguise.
