thenetherlands,fgdfnqb,t1_fgd6fb7,1580682006.0,Ik denk niet dat het de taak van de media is om die conclusie te trekken. Dat moeten we allemaal zelf doen. Jammer dat voor veel mensen logica niet zo belangrijk is als hun gevoel..
CompetitiveTFT,fgdeawz,t3_extcn8,1580681562.0,I don't understand the infinity edge change. I was under the impression that if you multiply a number with 100% you get the same number.

todayilearned,ffzpcbr,t1_ffypnz2,1580388854.0,"There was this experiment where a woman lived with a dolphin to see if it could be taught to speak English. It turned out to be really horny all the time, the teacher gave in to it's advances, and somehow LSD became involved and the experiment was stopped.

politics,ffwwort,t1_ffwjtpg,1580312724.0,"To be honest, I think we've just been very naive. I grew up under the impression that people wouldn't have such bad intentions. At least for me this is a reality check, and I sincerely hope that we can still do something about it"
AskReddit,fft7tm3,t1_fft0ot6,1580211371.0,Haha my thoughts exactly. When I make these kind of jokes my friends never know how to deal with them :') Guess they're not sure if I'm serious or not

eu4,ffbiu4u,t1_ffavanc,1579767318.0,"So it depends. You have 2 kind of influenza events, one from a port and one from a neighboring province. If it's the port I always pay the points, since it is an isolated event. If it's a neighboring province, then the event could happen at all the provinces with a border towards the source of the influenza, then it depends more on if I can really stop the spread or not"
