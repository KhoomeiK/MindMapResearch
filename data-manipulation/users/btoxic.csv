There are galleys throughout, and first class even has a high end dining car or two. There are cars for growing food, cattle, and fish as well. 

The train also has 2 stories and is 1001 cars or 10kms long.... So there's lots not shown in the movie that will be shown in the TV series."

todayilearned,ff7vdqy,t1_ff6fngi,1579659258.0,Shannon Falls is much different than Lynn Canyon. Much higher and not jumping friendly like the canyon.  Both are still lethal... Not condoning their behaviour in the least.

todayilearned,ff7urjd,t1_ff67yjl,1579658847.0,"I lived in North Vancouver for years, I spent most summer days in Lynn Canyon through the early 90's. 

  I remeber all those time as thrilling and changed who I was as a person. I wouldn't be as extroverted as I am today without the friends I made there.  However, All it takes is one moment to screw something up, but thankfully nobody I knew in that time got hurt.

It's odd seeing people share these moments in video, as we were always quite subdued about going off those jumps.  If you weren't there, you didn't experience it, it was like fight club, years before fight club."
