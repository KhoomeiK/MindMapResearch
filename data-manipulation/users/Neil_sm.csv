You can still buy it [directly from Gibson](https://www.gibson.com/Guitar/USA1R6524/Les-Paul-Standard-60s/Iced-Tea) but not sure if they ship to wherever you are.

It's hard to say whether they are replacing it or not for the new year.  Gibson is no longer using model years on their product lines as of late 2019,  but they still will very likely be updating and replacing some models every year.  

I don't think that particular model is going to be changed at all for 2020 though, there wasn't any updates announced at NAMM regarding the standard 50s/60s models.  They also usually quietly remove products on the Gibson website when they stop selling them, but those are still available and unchanged there. 

In other words, there probably would be no reason to wait because they aren't going to differentiate between a 2019 and a 2020 LP standard 60s.  Other than the serial number and production date indicating which year it was manufactured, it's going to be the same model for that one."

Guitar,fen7v1t,t3_eq0ngh,1579278888.0,"Lol I had close to this exact same experience at a big show.   There were a few bands playing including a headliner that was a local-based band who had 2 top 40 hits a few years prior to that.   Not a huge act or anything but they were locally very well known so the show was well attended.  I was in one of the earlier-playing bands. 

This was rockabilly/surf music and our vocalist usually added some slapback delay and  reverb to his vocals, which was something we worked out in advance with the sound guys.  

So when we were up on state they kind of did it half assed and had this reverb/delay effect (that was also set with the time param way too long) on basically everything including my guitar as it was miked in the pa.   I had my own analog delay effect which would conflict and this was not exactly what we wanted but gotta roll with it sometimes.  

But as I was hearing the guitar through the pa kind of conflicting what was on stage with my amp, everything sounded horribly out of tune to me.  I spent way too long trying to fix it by ear in between songs before finally fixing  with a tuner and hoping it sounded better in the audience than it did on stage.  

Was super embarrassing and made me feel like an amateur.  But definitely learned a few things from it.  Like I immediately purchased a pedal tuner after that (that should be  common practice really but this was 20 years ago when there weren’t quite as many online resources available to learn this stuff!). Which became a godsend really, I can tune quickly and completely quietly on stage between songs.  

So just learn from it and move on!  It’s not really as huge of a deal as you’re making it out to be.   Even the foo fighters have had a few occasions where they stopped a song and started over in front of a live audience because a guitar was tuned wrong or something wasn’t working.    Sometimes it’s just the only option.  The more you play, eventually you’ll get good at being able

Some people say the tone is different (better?) with a 6-point, some people say that's possibly a placebo effect like fingerboard wood.  

Also there are debates about tuning stability.  The more modern 2-point tremelo supposedly stays in tune better, especially if you are using it a lot -- that's why the modern Fenders have switched to those mostly.  The 6-point is for period-correctness in the Vintera.

This is still covering a little less than a single 1x15” speaker (707 square inches).   But 2x10 would be larger than 1x12.


I run a 500w Ampeg portaflex through a 2x10 cabinet.  Actually my cabinet is 8 ohms so my amp runs at 350w at 8ohms. It is supposed to run 500w at 4 ohms, which means if i added a second 8 ohm cabinet it would be running at 4 ohms and would boost the available power somewhat to drive all the speakers.  

But so far I haven’t needed that for most small/medium size rooms.   Also I’m not playing with a any super-loud groups, but it holds its own just fine with a drumset and electric guitars.  This also is fine as a practice amp.  I can simply turn it down at home — pretty much any amp loud enough to gig will still work turned down to bedroom levels.  I have the option to play with headphones with my amp, but usually it’s not necessary when I'm down in the basement."

Guitar,feefpga,t1_feed99y,1579032815.0,"There may have been a few more also, at least during the Bluesbreakers era.   There may be some confusion there too, because the 1960-63 SG models were called ""Les Paul SG,"" but he definitely had a few regular 50s bursts.   In his autobiography he mentions several around that time, including one that he had to [abandon in Greece](https://www.whereseric.com/eric-clapton-tour/24/10/1965).  

Now that linked write-up claims he saved the Les Paul, but Clapton's autobiography has a different account where he said, ""I left behind a beautiful Gibson Les Paul and a Marshall amp.""   They had been playing for a crazed manager who had actually threatened to cut off Clapton's hands if he left the band, so he decided not to screw around and bolted after the gig."
Guitar,fee7ku4,t1_fedigmt,1579028040.0,"He played a [regular Les Paul on the Bluesbreakers Beano album](https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/has-eric-claptons-legendary-beano-les-paul-burst-been-found) before that too.  He had a few  circa-‘59 LPs in that era.  The woman tone was kind of honed on those, the SG, and also on ES-335.  But the SG came a little later in Cream.  

Before that, in the yardbirds he was mostly using a telecaster and the 335."

fender,fechhy6,t1_febj44m,1578974041.0,"It’s probably just strung wrong by the current owner.  Strings get changed quite often, plus that guitar has kind of a non-standard bridge and tremelo (compared to like a strat or something), so it would certainly possible for someone to get confused with it.  

Could also be strung that way on purpose for whatever reason. For example some people like to restring a Les Paul so the strings wrap around the tailpiece because it supposedly increases sustain or changes the tone somewhat.  People like to experiment and modify!

But otherwise doesn’t necessarily look fake or anything like that.  I could be wrong but most copies/fake are going to be of either brand new stock or vintage (like say 1962) — something that’s going to sell for tens of thousands of dollars or more.  

Still it’s possible to find mods or non-standard parts on a not-as-collectible 90s model, but most of the time this will be some improvement that is hopefully disclosed by the seller."
