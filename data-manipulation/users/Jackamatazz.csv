explainlikeimfive,femrb8y,t1_femolo7,1579267354.0,I remember spending hours on that game fiddling with the specifics of the cars and when your shitty memory card went oh boy that sucked.

todayilearned,fejdbkl,t1_fejd5ya,1579168406.0,"I mean we did go spear fishing (another year, a different trip) off the point on the island, and when we came back in one of the locals told us about the great white sighting earlier that day. My logic is my second cousin has already been bitten by one so I’m not too scared of getting nibbled, odds are they’re not going get two people from the same family."

todayilearned,feizic7,t3_epdbvn,1579151664.0,"Was snorkeling near a reef on Kangaroo Island and one of these little fuckers was just chilling in open water next to the reef instead of in a nice rock pool (where it was bloody supposed to be). I didn’t see it until it was about 30cm away from where I was swimming as it was floating up quite high and I was looking at the reef... 
Don’t think I’ve ever swam backwards while keeping An eye on it so quickly. Ain’t about to die nuh-uh."
