HealthAnxiety,fgihyp7,t3_eypq6l,1580822193.0,I'm not sure if this post is actually health anxiety related? Maybe [r/askdocs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) will be more helpful :)
AmItheAsshole,fghy0hu,t3_eyfyvu,1580797495.0,NTA it sounds to me that they're people who glorify depression and treat it like a cute trend. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't genuinely have clinical depression. You were well within your rights to talk about your ED - Your friends sound like people who are uneducated about mental illness and only find it acceptable to talk about when it's being used as a cute trend.

offmychest,fgetyf6,t1_fgere5b,1580709904.0,"Yeah I've been diagnosed with Panic Disorder but it wasn't triggered by any key milestones. My parents, grandparents and great grandparents have it too. It's just the way our brains are wired, I guess."
offmychest,fge88i9,t1_fge7csy,1580693588.0,"Constantly worrying that something bad will happen when there's no reason to. Irrational fears that prevent me from doing a lot of things. Intrusive thoughts that buzz around my head when I'm trying to sleep. Debilitating panic attacks that take away my ability to move, speak and breathe, then constantly worrying about when they'll occur again. My heart is always beating so fast that it makes my chest hurt and I don't think I've been able to take a proper deep breath since I was a kid. I also hold a diagnosis for health anxiety which makes me think I'm dying all the time."
HealthAnxiety,fgdbvp7,t3_exocvk,1580680869.0,"My health anxiety is the complete opposite. I take too many meds all the time and usually for no actual reason. I carry 3 different types of painkillers everywhere I go (my psychologist calls this a safety behaviour). In my head, I always think that by taking them then I'm ""preventing"" illness or ""treating an undiagnosed medical condition"" (sometimes even before I feel symptoms/pain). 

I love leaving the doctors office with anti biotics and usually feel angry whenever they don't prescribe anything (l feel like they're not taking whatever illness I have at the time seriously). 

I'm in therapy and working on it now."
Anxiety,fg4xqjo,t1_fg4r9g9,1580513464.0,I've done the ECG/EKG twice and everything showed up completely normal for me. I've been diagnosed with multiple different types of anxiety disorders so we already knew that was the cause of the chest pain. My doctor was just cautious.

Anxiety,ffhmg19,t3_etm95q,1579942304.0,I think I was 13 when I realized that I had an anxiety problem (was later diagnosed with three anxiety disorders) but I've struggled with anxiety my entire life.
Anxiety,ffhm8ih,t3_etmw4q,1579941993.0,"Yes. I have health anxiety and whenever I convince myself I have a disease, I get symptoms of that disease. Like when I thought I had a brain tumor, I was having migraines every day :/"
Anxiety,ffhm5tb,t3_etgvbs,1579941881.0,My mum takes effexor and says that she no longer gets the worry symptoms of anxiety (the excessive uncontrollable worry loop). Whenever I have the worry symptoms she tells me that she hasn't experienced it in years because of her meds.
Anxiety,ffhltfn,t3_etnotb,1579941376.0,"My earliest experience with anxiety was 4 years old (I have been diagnosed with multiple anxiety disorders since). I remember feeling very overwhelmed, anxious and panicky very easily as a child. 

My earliest memory of an anxiety attack, I was 4 years old and a birthday party and felt like the world was going to end. I had a closing in sensation and feeling as though something bad was going to happened if I didn't leave the party immediately (I ran to my parents crying and they took me home). Since then, I experienced frequent panic attacks and anxiety attacks throughout my childhood (but never knew what they were?? I just assumed I was just a fearful/nervous/cautious/dramatic kid).

I've been diagnosed with health anxiety which I believe I've always kinda had (the earliest memory of me excessively worrying about my health and dying started at age 6). 

I'm not sure how common anxiety disorders are in young kids, but I'm pretty sure 90% of my anxiety was developed in the womb (thanks to my strong family history/ genetic link with anxiety disorders). The other 10% was probably environmental factors."
Anxiety,ffhldk8,t3_etnpz8,1579940741.0,"All the time. If I convince myself I have a particular illness, I'll start having all the symptoms of that illness. For example, when I thought I had a brain tumor, I was having migraines every single day. They all went away after the doctors in the ER told me I'm fine."
Anxiety,ffhl8wr,t3_etnwzx,1579940551.0,Shaking and trembling is a very common symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks. It means your body is in anxiety mode (aka the fight or flight response). Taking deep breaths or practicing some form of relaxation can help calm your body down and stop the shaking.
Anxiety,ffhl14u,t3_etmnup,1579940240.0,"I have panic disorder too and I experience this exact same symptom/sensation. I've checked my heart rate while this was happening and it was 170 beats per minute. It's a horrible sensation. I have had my heart checked (everything was completely normal), it's just heart palpitations."
HealthAnxiety,fdv8gy5,t3_en6c21,1578744587.0,"I have multiple anxiety disorders and experience something similar. My anxiety makes me very nausous/makes me vomit sometimes and when that happens I'm very repulsed by food and don't eat very much. If I'm throwing up multiples times a day from anxiety then I'll think ""what's the point of eating if I'm going to vomit it up?"". 

I definitely recommend seeing a doctor/therapist about your anxiety so you can receive the proper diagnosis and treatment. 

Good luck!!"
Anxiety,fdv0edh,t1_fduyvun,1578741679.0,"""I don't need a pill when I have normal anxiety"" ????? Do you have an anxiety disorder or not??? I'm not sure why you're ranting on this subreddit if you have ""normal anxiety""."
Anxiety,fduyvun,t3_emr4z6,1578741083.0,"I think you might be misunderstanding your doctor? He's saying that your stomach pains are caused by anxiety. As in anxiety is making your stomach hurt. Anxiety disorders cause physical symptoms so he's offering an SSRI to relieve your anxiety and hence relieve your physical anxiety symptoms.

If you don't believe that the stomach pains are caused by anxiety then yes see a different doctor."
Anxiety,fduy4ur,t1_fds7aor,1578740891.0,"In order to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety must be interfering with your day to day life (ie unable to go to school/work because of your anxiety symptoms, unable to attend parties or go to the shops or drive etc)."

Anxiety,fduxdyt,t3_en4s4k,1578740490.0,"I'm not sure how old you are but please talk to your parents about this and see a doctor. I'm 18 and I've been diagnosed with panic disorder, Health Anxiety and Generalized anxiety. I understand everything you just wrote and I know that you're not at all crazy, however, you do need help. Do some research about Health Anxiety Disorder and talk to your parents/doctors about it. 

Try taking deep breaths in the moments that your thoughts are racing and try distraction. I'm currently going through therapy with a psychologist and I can tell you for certain that it helps. 

My PM's are always open if you have any questions or need to talk to someone who understands. 

Good luck!!"
Anxiety,fdms7a3,t1_fdmrswq,1578563165.0,"I'm glad that you're feeling better. Just remember that you're definitely not alone when it comes to anxiety, there are sooo many people going through the exact same thing. Talking about it helps heaps. My pm's are always open if you need someone to talk to :)"
Anxiety,fdms07n,t3_em4j04,1578562888.0,"If he's having a panic/anxiety attack, do not touch him without asking if its okay as it can make things worse. When I'm having an attack, people talking to me makes it worse (e.g. asking me about the trigger or asking me if I'm okay etc). 

However, I've had people who let me know that they're there to support me and ask me if there's anything they can do. I find this really helpful and calms the situation.

Try helping him with breathing exercises which can relieve anxiety and panic attacks. Perhaps do them with him?

Try this: 

Inhale for 4 seconds.
Hold your breath for 2 seconds.
Exhale for 6 seconds.
Repeat till calm.

Also, letting him know that you're always there for him if he needs to talk or needs anything helps too.

If you have any more questions, please message me and I'll be more then happy to help :)"
Anxiety,fdmrh4o,t3_em5n3b,1578562147.0,"I highly recommend using lavender essential oil or spray each night (putting a few drops on your pillow or spraying your pillow will help). Drinking tea before bed such a peppermint tea, lavender tea, chamomile tea, may also help. 

Try doing breathing exercises too. 

Inhale for 4 seconds. 
Hold for 2 seconds.
Exhale for 6 seconds. 
Repeat until calm. 

I hope this helps, good luck!!"
Anxiety,fdmrbed,t3_em6wy2,1578561925.0,"Hi, it sounds like what you're experiencing is a panic attack (source: I've been diagnosed with panic disorder and experience these frequently). 

If you haven't already, turn on the house lights (don't sit in the dark - this will make things worse). 

Do breathing exercises:

Try this: 

Inhale for 4 seconds.
Hold your breath for 2 seconds.
Exhale for 6 seconds.
Repeat until calm.

If you are able to, make yourself a hot drink that isn't caffeinated. Chamomile, peppermint, lavender tea are 3 of my go to's. If you don't have tea, hot water with lemon and/or honey will also help.

Do you live with people that can help you or can you call someone that can help you? Having supportive people around you will also help.

I've read that squeezing ice cubes may help stop a panic attack? I've never tried it but it's worth a shot. 

Good luck!!!! Message me any time that you need help or support :)"
Anxiety,fdmqwib,t3_em513c,1578561352.0,"Hi, I've been diagnosed with health anxiety. I've convinced myself that I've had every imaginable disease or condition based on little things like a sore throat or a stomach ache.

If this proceeds please talk to a doctor and receive treatment. I'm currently going through exposure therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy for my health anxiety.

Good luck!!"
Anxiety,fdmqs0f,t3_em64tp,1578561178.0,"Hi, this sounds like a panic attack to me (source: I've been diagnosed with a condition called Panic Disorder which makes me have them often). 

Doing breathing exercises while this is happening can be very helpful.

Inhale for 4 seconds.
Hold breath for 2 seconds.
Exhale for 6 seconds.

Repeat until calm.

Good luck!!"
Anxiety,fdmqjod,t3_em3lbl,1578560849.0,"Hi, I know exactly what you mean about experiencing a ""rush"" of anxiety that only lasts a few seconds. You feel a burning sensation in your whole body and your heart beats rapidly and you feel so beyond nausous. This usually happens to me if I look at something or think of something that makes me anxious but then goes away after a few seconds.

To answer your question, yes you can have an anxiety disorder without having anxiety attacks/panic attacks."
