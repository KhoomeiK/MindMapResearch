Let the enemy AI kill your friendly AI over and over again. As long as you have your bubble and stasis always up, There will be a few hundred shards in front of you in less than 10 minutes. Keep your bubble live, grab a stack, deposit for an instant win. Of you choose to continue, there is still over 100 shards to grab and instantly win again.

The only important part is to make sure and grab energy orbs around the map right after casting stasis, so you never run out of energy.

Everything is predicated on both sides of the arguments conceding your points completely, while also ignoring the points of the other side. How can you do both when one sides argument is that overpopulation is the issue? pretending like resource management doesn't exist just so that your argument is stronger does nothing but prove how weak your argument is. You try to turn everything to generic words like ""suffering"" So that you can ignore the context of the argument.

Like I said, if society felt that all fetuses were lives, then the laws would mirror that. However, That's not the case. The medical community accepts that, with current technology, a fetus is not viable before the third trimester. That is why I completely agree with laws that make it illegal for late term abortion. Trying to push for heartbeat bans laws is doing nothing but showing moderates that you are overzealous and pushing more people to the other side. your inability to understand nuance does nothing but weaken your entire side."

by the way, you should realize that it's a terrible hypothetical when it requires everyone to assume that your argument is 100% legitimate. It's a much better hypothetical if you went on the premise that abortion wasn't murder, and then still showed how horrific it was. Trying to compare it to what you think is the worst mass murder in history is nothing more than a pathetic strawman attempt.

It also isn't a good idea to have your argument completely ignore the other person's argument. If my point was that there are already overpopulation issues that are causing people to be without food and water, then your argument that you can care about both issues is illegitimate. You can't really care about overpopulated areas starving to death and be against them being able to terminate pregnancies."
pics,ffive4q,t1_ffir3nq,1579983639.0,"Sorry. This is what happens sometimes when you ask a question in the middle of a conversation between two people. Your comment gets attributed to the person.

If you look at the comment that I was replying to, then you can see that I wasn't the one that started the throwing of opinions. I apologize for you being caught in that, but most of my points still stands. I'm not making a pro-choice or a anti-abortion argument. I don't give a s*** about either. I'm just pointing out the reality that abortion is a lesser evil.

It's also really stupid to try and call me out for making nonsensical hypothetical when you came to the conversation by making a nonsensical hypothetical. You put a whole bunch of lines that I didn't say or are contextually misunderstood, so I doubt that you're coming from a good faith position either. Please show me where I said that an embryo has less worth than a living child. Worth has nothing to do with it. If it was about worth, then I'd say kill everybody. Nobody's worth anything.

You have still failed to make a single argument as to why abortion is bad. You try to use some emotional argument, but emotions have nothing to do with real world implications. Who cares if I don't strengthen the pro-choice argument? If you're stupid enough to get pregnant and be unable to take care of your child, then you're probably better off sucking it out of your uterus. That's reality. for every community that will come together and help a mother raise her child, there are a hundred kids starving.

And answer your actual question, I don't consider a fetus to be the same thing as a human life because the current law doesn't. It's not about worth. It's about letter of the law. Change the law, then my opinion changes because legally speaking, it's different. morally speaking, they're all worthless, and I could not care less if someone who had autonomy wanted to die. If someone doesn't have autonomy, but they have someone who has control over them, and that person wants them to die, so be it. Euthanasia is legal in many countries, and a few states in the United States. Being pro euthanasia is about the best piece of ammunition I could have against someone who questions being pro-choice..."

None of that changes the fact that I still agree with the idea that abortion is a lesser evil. notice how I'm willing to acknowledge the realities of the world and at least admit that there are problems with abortions.

It's about reducing his strain on the tax system. That's all that the government is about. The government doesn't give a shit about you.

Lee freeing his slaves while Abraham's wife still held her family slaves. everything that isn't disputing that point is nothing but trying to distract from my comment. I don't give a s*** about why they went to war 150 years ago when nothing about that war has any real effect on my day-to-day life. 

I'm just simply pointing out that pretending like millions of people were willing to go to war over the freedom of African slaves in 1860 America is laughable. It requires ignoring all of reality and giving the winning American side morals and behaviors that they didn't have. Doesn't it seem odd that the reasoning behind every war in the last 100 years is extremely vague and opaque, yet people have no problem saying that the civil war was 100% fought because the North wanted to free slaves from the south?"

Please show me anywhere where I tried to make claims that the Republican party was one way and the Democratic party was another way.

If we want to be honest, Robert e Lee was a racist. So was Abraham Lincoln. So was Mary Todd Lincoln. So was 99.999% of the population. Even if they thought black men shouldn't be slaves, they still thought black men were less than them. People are so in their feelings about defending the union that they ignore the realities of the world at the time. In reality, no politician would ever take the chance on freeing the slaves if it wasn't for the fact they were already in the middle of a war.

todayilearned,ff31aiw,t1_ff30l6g,1579531020.0,"I love the ignorant attempt at straw manning my argument. I never claimed that the North was able to take a free black man and turn them into a slave, but the northerners did not have to free their existing slaves. I understand that nuance is hard for all of you people, but being able to understand the words that you read is kind of important. If you were a slave in the North before the civil war, and your owner didn't voluntarily free you, you were still a slave in the North. The South was a terrible place because a free black man could still be taken and placed into slavery because there was no legitimate legal system to care about freed black men in the South.

yet again, I'm not defending the actions of anybody during the civil war because both sides were pieces of shit. I'm simply pointing out realities that people tend to ignore because they love the propaganda of history. One side had to be pure and the other side had to be evil. There's no chance that both sides were full of shitty self-serving people...

todayilearned,ff30jp4,t1_ff2zxld,1579530418.0,"Where does that dispute my comment? All that does is show a legal case about property rights. Yes, in our current world, it's disgusting to look at a court case about human beings like property, but at their time, no one would have complained about that. It was not the fact that they were slaves, but rather whether they were his property or not. It had absolutely nothing to do with emancipation rights. It also doesn't dispute my claim that Mary Todd held her family slaves long after Robert e Lee freed his.

I think you people are getting confused because we are talking about historical events. I'm not defending or championing slavery. I'm simply pointing out that it was a war at a time where neither side cared about black people, so the war was not about slavery.

I will ask you the same thing I've asked everyone that's called me a racist. Please show me anything from the United States government before the South seceded from the Union that suggested freeing ALL slaves in the United States. The problem is that you won't find it, because it wasn't about slavery. It was about money. 

The entire civil war was predicated on the fact that southern states were beginning to dominate the economy and were garnering too much political power for the merchant politicians in the north. Politicians in the north decided to impose tariffs on the south cotton so that their mercantile industries would not be negatively impacted, and this led to strife which eventually led to the secession of the southern states.

The North had the balls to label states as free states and slave states, but they did it based on whether you agreed with them on tariffs. If you agree with them on tariffs, you're a free state, if not, you're a slave state. Fun fact, free states and slave states both had slaves in them...

todayilearned,ff2z44d,t1_ff2yq2p,1579529216.0,"yet again, you aren't proving that anyone was trying to end slavery, just that these people like their slavery.

todayilearned,ff2y7hc,t1_ff2x82t,1579528406.0,"Yet again, I'm waiting to see anyone show something where the North was talking about ending slavery. It's easy for people to keep bringing up areas where a couple of states mentioned slavery in their articles of secession, yet they can never actually show me anything where the North was talking about ending slavery.

You don't get to say that the North was obviously ending slavery because a couple of states happen to mention slavery in their reasoning for leaving. It requires you to completely ignore the economic status of the country at the time, and how the North was imposing tariffs on southern States in order to lower the cost of cotton for northern states.

Most people don't even realize that the United States before the civil war was more like the modern EU than a United country. The civil war happened because it was like Finland deciding that France could no longer export any of its goods without paying ridiculous fees because France was a region where wine could be grown, so the French had a thriving wine industry, and Finland didn't like paying high wine prices.

So, again, can you please show me anything before the civil war where THE NORTH was talking about ending slavery? because, yet again, if you can't show that the North was really trying to end slavery, then you can't say that the South started a war against them to keep their slaves..."

todayilearned,ff2wxaj,t1_ff2w8ei,1579527202.0,"He actually fought a war so that the North couldn't decide to randomly tax the South in order to protect business interests of northerners. The South fought the civil war for the same reason that the colonies fought against the British. They disagreed with taxation against them when they didn't have equal representation in the federal government.

If the civil war was a war about slavery, then why did the North not bring up the concept of the emancipation proclamation until after the war was already going on for years? I'll tell you why. It's because the North needed more soldiers, and the promise of a slaves freedom if they joined the northern military was an easy way to gain free cannon fodder.

Until anyone can show me anything from the federal government, BEFORE the Southern states succeeded from the union, that pushed for the end of slavery, then you're just spouting revisionist bullshit.

I don't care if you believe that the civil war was about ending slavery, despite the fact that it wasn't, but don't be so ignorant as to pretend like the northerners weren't slave owning pieces of garbage too. The only difference is that they lived in a climate that wasn't supportive of cotton farming.
