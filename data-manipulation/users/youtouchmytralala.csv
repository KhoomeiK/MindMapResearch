There's quite a well established link between guns and suicides now. And it makes sense, it's not saying owning a gun makes you want to kill yourself more. It just says that it gives you a pretty thorough and instant way of doing it that requires less preparation and time where you otherwise might rethink things."
AskReddit,ffg0uwx,t3_etcyd6,1579896028.0,"Alright I'll take a crack at this.

Whenver you see a distinct phenonema in society, it's often the result of a myriad of factors intersecting and I think male suicide is a great example of this. I'll say up front, I'm skeptical that the solution is anything close to as simple men sharing their feelings more so here's what I see as contributing to the problem and some potential solutions:

1. When men try to kill themselves, they really go for it. Women actually do attempt suicide at higher rates, but they use methods that aren't likely to work - pills, etc. Men usually put a gun to to their heads. I suspect this has something to do with us being generally more aggressive, more risk taking and less likely to make statement about needing help before it's too late. On that note - guns, men have better access to them. They're extremely effective tools for offing yourself. The suicide rate is pushed higher in many US states because of gun access alone. So in terms of reducing suicide, reducing the amount of guns is actually a pretty good way to go, though it does nothing to address the underlying issues of people wanting to kill themselves.

2. Isolation. A lack of meaningful connections to others seems to play as big a role in overall well being and happiness as anything else. It's also true that men experience lonliness at a higher rate than women. Maybe we're just worse at establishing and maintaining social connections, maybe on average we work more, I don't know but for whatever reason it's the truth. In terms of solutions establishing and reinvigorating good community spaces where people can interact and form meaningful bonds. Encouraging recreation, social hobbies, etc. Icidently, feelings of lonliness, having less friends and a decrease in connection are on the rise which brings me to ...

3. Cultural, economic and technological changes. This one is huge to parse apart and I'm sure doctoral thesis could and have been written on the subeject, but I think it's more difficult for men to fall into a path that provides meaningful purpose than it used to be. Societal expectations aren't keeping pace with societal change. Things like owning your own home and making a good family supporting wage are trickier than they used to be - but it's still a personal and cultural expectation for men. Technology, trade and changes in resource extraction have hit some communities particularly hard, where traditional work for men is a thing of the past (think the Rust Belt or Appalachia). Also, if it's true that men are generally worse at establishing and maintaing social connections, it may follow that the weakening of traditional instiutions that bind people to one another, norms around religion, country, marriage etc, may effect them disproportionately. My opinion is that good economic policy that focuses on providing improving wages, wellbeing, agency and social support is key. Addressing cultural changes is a big topic which I'm not sure I have the warewithall to get into here."

Even if this acutally is a solution, why not just loosen your knot a bit more before your untie? Your way I'm sure makes the yosemite finish even more prone to rolling (which I've had guides tell me has actually resulted accidents, can't find any accident reports to back that up), makes your knot bulkier, instroduces another point for it to get snagged, and overall looks silly."
