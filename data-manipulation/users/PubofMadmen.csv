I lived in Nederland (Holland) for a few years during the late 80s & 90s... this video reminds me of many children raised there during that era.  There was this thought of teaching of what I summarized as a ""non-respect & non-discipline school of thought"" to children under the age of 8 ???

The crazy part is the parents were crazy adamant and seemed proud of this ""our children are free to express themselves, and f*** you if you disagree”- I believe it may have been called the ""Steiner"" version in Nederland schools philosophy ???.  In the long run, every child I knew raised under this thought grew up to be royal A-holes, including my 8 nieces and nephews. Overall, personally speaking, the majority of results in that family and in the other families we knew of has been wholesale tragic.  

Of course, there is a growing backlash to this... today, there seems to be parents that are over compensating and now seem to  ""over-discipline"" their children in rebellion to their own upbringings. Given a choice at the time I would have happily chosen the latter."

I was never spanked again, there was no bullsh!t counting, no lectures, no time-outs LOL, no sitting in corners, no threats, no yelling at me to behave... when I was messing up, all papa had to do was call my name and give me ""the look"" if I continued misbehaving.  I never did. Never.

When I had my own children, he shared this great secret, it worked as intended.  My father and his 10 brothers were raised under the same exact matter.  Each of my seven grandchildren have been raised with this secret.  

To the day papa died, there was the deepest love and respect between us.  Even though I live in Europe, we spoke everyday.  Almost a year later, I still miss and think about him everyday, the greatest gift he ever gave me was the secret to childrearing - it turned out to be the easiest hassle-free thing I have ever done.

MadeMeSmile,feouvk2,t1_fensob4,1579305932.0,"While the science will simply explain it that the bird was looking for the person(s) that most likely comes by to feed the bird(s) out of hand.  It’s a shorter training process than most people believe.  Wild birds are opportunists, they’ll grab a free meal where ever possible if they have been trained to trust us.  This European Robin in the video has definitely been trained, I've seen this behavioral characteristic thousands of times. This cutey was definitely looking into that palm for bird seed- ""hey dummy, you forgot my seed"".

You begin by scattering a few seeds on the ground, once they become used to a free meal, slowly you appear on a chair with your hand extended with much more seed in the palm of your hand than on the ground.  Hold still.  Continue this each day for a week... within a few days more they’ll land briskly on your hand until trust is cemented, thereafter each time you or someone appears with an extended hand and palm out - bird(s) will fly down looking for a free meal.

My amateur ornithologist father-in-law taught me this beautiful trait, he was wonderful with feeding, nesting and mending sick or hurt backyard and local birds.  After this lovely man passed away, as a tribute, my husband began feeding the wild birds from hand at his gravesite, it’s truly the greatest tribute to my father-in-law.  When ever people visit loved ones at that cemetery, there’s a bag of birdseed at the front office for anyone wishing to feed the local cemetery birds by hand.  It’s truly a lovely feeling to feed mother nature’s wonderful feathered jewels.  

It’s fun to believe this is some miraculous hocus-pocus - I guarantee it isn’t.  Some lovely wonderful human taught our winged friend(s) there to trust people when they extend their hand out.  There are ample videos on YouTube showing how to train and feed wild birds from hand.  Check out those on hand feeding American Blue-Jays - they’re wonderful.  Here in Europe, our lovely European Robin, like that in the video, are the easiest to train.

EDIT:
A favourite is LesleyTheBirdNerd, Lesley Earle in Newfoundland.  She probably has about 200 videos, mostly on ornithology with plenty on wild bird hand feeding.  She’s ridiculous, a true modern day Snow White, she walks out in the woods, extends out her arms and hands and every variety of bird, from tiny chickadees to Jays, squirrels and snow rabbits appear from everywhere.  Landing on her shoulders, taking warm refuge in the hood of her coat.  She and her vast knowledge are utterly a gift from the gods.

A few counter-Trump people got into an arena and onto the main floor, a young black girl.  The hysteria of a huge mob scene broke a few meters from where we stood, and what occurred was as bad if not worse than this.  First a pro-Trump group got a hold of her, some huge shirtless guys, and then the future President was instructing them to ""take her out and beat her"" .  My colleagues and I followed this mob outside into a foyer area, it was horrendously bad, when the mob was done with them, we then witnessed the security guards (not sure) have a second go at this young black girl and her ""defender"" (a white middle age man that had tried to shield her - he was left in terrible shape).

When we began reporting what we had witnessed, it was at this time that this presidential candidate turned his ugly focus on the media.  We had to literally hire security to escort us in and out of events.  Quite a few colleagues in the broadcast and print field did not escape from physical attacks, at events, restaurants or our hotels.  It remains the ugliest time in my career, many of us witnessed mob attacks within and outside Trump events.

One is a strict personal rule of mine - tell no one when you do good.  I don’t do good to get praise and adulation or to convince someone else to do good or the person receiving ""to pay it forward"".  I'm doing it with a pure motive to do good because it is needed, and I am asking for no recognition or praise in return... the deed is only between me and my husband.   No Facebook, no blog, no Instagram, no Twitter... 

BUT you are correct, learning of their secret (inadvertently through their son) prompted us to also secretly do some good out there.  After years of our secret, with the internet and social media, it’s become a struggle to remain anonymous or convincing others that we want no awards or recognition in return or that this is not ""click bait""."

I first bought some tubes squeezers at local arts supply store, I have some that are about 30 years old.  There are several versions, I must have at least 15 now and they can be dead cheap.  

Here in Europe - curry, garlic paste, tomato paste, comes in tubes... our frigos are a lot smaller, limited room to your jumbo size American containers...  these tube squeezers come in super handy."

Toby... named after the first Disney film we watched together.  (I believe it had to do with a farm boy named Toby that ran away to join a circus???)

EDIT:  Toby Tyler, Disney 1960"

Toby pup was really good times, so faithful, I was so loved, he knew all my secrets and he took all of them to the grave without telling anyone.  He was my truest friend... to this day whenever I visit the States I think of visiting his burial site before my own parents graves.

I'm now in my early 60s and still thinking of him.  This brought real tears, Shit... I really am getting old."

I intensely studied several languages, moved to Europe over 30 years ago and got my education for practically free... I could have waited.  Oh well."

BreadTube,fc8wfzt,t1_fc8c7re,1577543140.0,"You made more sense in these few paragraphs than all the debates and back and forth arguments.  Biden is just an opportunist, seems like another DNC set-up, Hillary 2.0... I like nutty Joe a lot and I like my nutty uncle a lot - but I don’t want either of them running the country.  

We all saw what the outcome of Hillary was - everyone stayed home on election day.  She should have won every state in a landslide election against Trump but instead we stayed home.  Have we learned nothing from that election?

You’re absolutely correct,  I’m going with the guy that has been 100% consistent for the last 40 years.  You convinced me to get off my ass and see what I can do to help get Bernie elected.  I’m tired of the bullshit.  It’s Bernie or bust for me in 2020."
