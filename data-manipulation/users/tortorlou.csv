I got the super fancy one with the digital display with SIX bottles and two canisters for only $30. People want to use them then let them collect dust and want to just get rid of them. Highly recommend checking for second hand before buying new!"

AustralianShepherd,fenxshy,t1_fen9mjo,1579292415.0,A dyson was the game changer for us. We vacuum at least twice a day but it only takes a few mins. Keeping their coats brushed regularly helps too.

AskReddit,fedewaq,t1_fecmwmo,1579009621.0,I am terrified of storms but absolutely LOVE Twister. I live in Houston and when Ike hit it was one of the few movies at my uncle’s house where we were staying so we watched it on repeat. Now anytime there’s a big storm I have to watch it.
AskReddit,fe4w6e9,t1_fe4v798,1578863360.0,I struggle with this. I feel like it’s been engrained into me to feel like if I’m not doing as much as I can then I’m wasting time.

Like you said, it’s supposed to help me stay organized and stop forgetting things. If I’m stuck on that a silly typo that no one but me will see, then how is it helping me? So here’s to a new year and embracing all those typos!"

miniaussie,fc8otvk,t1_fc8jeuz,1577539250.0,Hey I left my keys in the ignition with car on and doors unlocked. WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOMEONE STOLE MY CAR!? It’s the same thing. If you can’t take your dog in with you where you’re going then leave them at home!
raisedbynarcissists,fc0ayu3,t1_fc09xt2,1577285441.0,"No, she’s not doing her best. She is continually choosing to protect him instead of you. I grew up in this same bullshit, it wasn’t until I had a kid of my own that I truly realized how messed up it was my mom never once stepped in to protect me. She used me as a meat shield, as long as it was directed at me she was in the clear. The few times I stopped up for myself she would scream at me for “getting her in trouble.” So it was always my fault for doing what she was supposed to do for me. None of this is acceptable. She knows it but is using you to protect herself. I was about your age when I finally started pulling myself out of the web and getting help for myself. It’s a long road but now that your family sees them for what they are, it’s the window you need to start putting yourself first."
