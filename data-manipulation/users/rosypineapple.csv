He could do it himself, but usually if I leave it up to him, he forgets/gets too sleepy and just doesn’t do it, which lets his hands get worse. He’s a UPS driver and during the winters his hands get SO cracked and sore. So I do it and we talk, and almost always end up laughing super hard about the most random things. Its special, takes five minutes and is a nice way to end the day together."
