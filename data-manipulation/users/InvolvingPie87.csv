Even in a fair amount of time, he was still way above average. Saying he was never as good as them is disingenuous. He reached them, he just couldn’t tread their water forever, especially after the injury. 

I’m not saying he’s generational. However, you don’t need to be a generational talent to reach that level for a shorter period of time. 

You cannot say that he never reached them and then immediately take that back by putting time into the equation. Generational talents are different because time doesn’t matter to them really, and you’d be right. However, saying he never got there isn’t true."

Now, I was probably one of the worst skaters we had. I couldn’t do anything aside from pass the puck and interrupt passes, and this was when I was like 12 years old and just hit a massive growth spurt. As such, my skating was shit. 

We show up one morning and this tall dude who was really good was skating around shooting pucks before we got on, and we were told that he was going to be one of our instructors for the day. None of us knew who he was by looking at him, he was just really fucking good. Eventually I ask who he is, and he replies “do you know who Steven stamkos is”. I actually recognized the name and said so, and then he just said “I’m Steven Stamkos.”  I just laughed and was like “okay buddy” and shittily skated away. 

Not ten minutes later we started a drill, and right as I took my first stride I blew a wheel, smacked into the wall, and my stick shot out of my hands and hit him in the face. Ended up giving him a cut just below or above his eye, can’t remember which. He left after that. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that it was actually Stamkos, and I unknowingly bullied him and gooned him out of the practice. I was an awful player and quit pretty soon after. I still feel bad about it though

So I didn’t directly play against him or anything but this is the first time I can really share this story. Also for the record this happened at Chilled Ponds in Chesapeake, Virginia. Don’t remember exactly when, but somewhere around 2010-2012"
