As such I'm not all that much of a fan of urban life, I prefer the small town environment where I can walk to where I need to be. I get my dose when I visit my parents in the standard-town and once a year when I make pilgrimage to my little fishing-village. 

However, currently I'm living on the outskirts of the capital area with my partner, a couple of cats, and a young dog. It's about as rural as you can get in ""the city"", being in a fairly isolated neighborhood with the wilderness facing our back yard, but I'd probably not have chosen to live there myself if I had been living alone, the morning traffic alone gives me hives.

explainlikeimfive,fgp6n82,t1_fgp5nf0,1580998178.0,"That's slightly different, let's tackle two things.

> There is a central authority

For the actual election, most of the time there isn't, at least not one that directly controls the tally for a significant area. By the time the ""central"" office has received the tallies from all the polls each of the voting centers has already released their counts and those with stakes in the election have had their finger on the process looking for errors. The first we hear of the results is usually from the counters themselves, which makes it harder for a ""centralized"" authority to go out and say ""Despite district A, district B and district C all reporting a Yellow Party victory by 10 percentage points, we've aggregated the votes and the purple party won a 2/3 majority"". 


> The DNC

That's a different beast: there the votes where decentralized and ""uncorrected"", which are funneled in to a centralized representation at f.i a convention or the Electoral College. There you've stopped saying ""We're going to corrupt the votes"" and are moving towards ""We're going to corrupt those that were voted to serve that specific office""; or you're trying to manipulate an entirely different election.


The primaries are voting people who will go to vote for a candidate at the DNC, they are two different elections. You can try to manipulate one and leave the other untouched."

dataisbeautiful,fgp4tj9,t1_fgp3nr0,1580996860.0,"It's out of bounds because the discussion starts on the premise that at some point the United States will elect a president for the union and is turned towards the multiple issues and possibilities that go along with that inevitability. We've then gone down a path of pointing out how the State and the people in the state aren't the same entity and have different priorities. A reasonable person would assume that the ""bounds"" of that discussion then relates in some way to states, their citizens, the electoral college, the voting process, the election districts, or if we should bother with elections in the first place and just decide by coin toss. If you want to change the topic then ""Yes, I see what you mean, but I think it would be better to disband the union all together"" or what have you is perfectly acceptable, but you have to actually mildly engage with the topic at hand first and relate it to the topic you want to discuss. The discussion is on the Electoral College, so the expectation is that your side of the discussion at least attempts to engage with that institution for a little while before moving on to anarchy or libertarian possibilities.

If someone asked me ""hey, if I had to kill myself, how should I do it"" the underlying premise isn't ""I'm going to kill myself, and *you* are going to decide how"", it's ""I'm bored and want to explore a hypothetical and the pros and cons of each"". Neither of us are going to alter how the US does presidential elections, and probably neither of us should have that power. It is, however, fun to discuss what we *would* change with the system and how the current implementation is subpar in some regards and optimal in others."
dataisbeautiful,fgp280v,t1_fgp1cbf,1580994809.0,"That is not my assumption nor relevant to my argument. Don't vaguely reach for a script in response to what you think I'm saying, actually read the words. It isn't a good look for you when you answer a discussion that isn't taking place.


I'm not advocating for a nationwide popular vote or that this isn't a question about how the presidency and his power resides in DC, and my scope has never gone beyond the state-level. Heck, you're arguing for a more centralized government than I am: a state government *is* centralized government. Below it you have counties, municipalities, districts, townships, you could split each of those down : why is your assumption that some bureaucrat in Austin should have more of the personal power of a Houston resident? That, however, doesn't matter to this discussion. 


States award delegation as a block. That's perfectly fine, and understandable. If a State was a person they'd probably not award fractional votes because it dilutes their own vote. States picking presidents award votes in unified blocks.

However, that disenfranchises the people *in* those states that don't belong to the majority. Those people might not agree that the state awards their votes in blocks. 

They might f.i want each *county* to award a single delegation, decentralizing the system even further, and bringing the power closer to the people and further away from the big government, which is a point you probably might like if you wouldn't assume it meant a popular vote. 


Both the State and People have valid concerned. States want their voice to be heard undivided. People in those states don't want their voices ignored because they don't agree with the state. The answer falls in if you want the US to be a union of sovereign states, or a union of people *in* sovereign states. The more you decentralize how the delegates in the EC are chosen, the closer you get to the latter. The more centralized you make the process, the closer to the former you get.


The central government of the US and it's relations to the States is an entirely different discussion (or the same discussion on power and centralization of communities, just with the actors swapped), and doesn't at this time belong in the discussion of ""the priorities of States as sovereign entities are *not* always the same priorities as the priorities of those that inhabit that state""."
dataisbeautiful,fgp08ez,t1_fgoyrmn,1580993344.0,"I see you have completely missed my point, so lets try again:

What makes sense to a state as an entity in a federation does not always align with what makes sense to the people that populate that state: that is partly why the Senate exists in the first place. This isn't a question about if States should have more power than the centralized government or not, it is a question of differing priorities between states and people.


If you are a state, awarding all your delegation to one candidate makes perfect sense, and is what most people would do if they could cast fractional votes.

However, the fact that States do what makes sense and do block voting means that they nullify the voice of the minority completely. People tend to dislike it when you do that, even when you have sound reasoning.

It makes sense from a democracy standpoint that states award their delegation in proportion to the state-wide popular vote (or by electoral districts if you want a more local representation). It makes zero sense to do that from a ""Union of states"" perspective because doing so dilutes the voice of the State as an undivided entity. 


If you want to give the power to congress, the state, the county, the town, or to each household is then a different discussion."
dataisbeautiful,fgoygh6,t1_fgoxang,1580991832.0,"That's a pretty naive suggestion that doesn't fix the underlying concern.

This is the advice on the same quality as buying a new car because the old one ran out of gas or sweeping all the dust and dirt under the rug because then you can't see it anymore. 



Most people have a higher standard for upending their lives than disliking winner-take-all politics. Some move between states, and some due to political reasons. However, given that most states still have plenty of opposition voters your assessment of what my hypothetical person would do is pretty short-sighted. If all Republicans are moving from California then I wonder where the 22% of Republicans in the Californian legislature got their votes from, or the 43.2% of Texas votes that voted for Clinton in 2016. It's not that people want to form isolated bubbles of single types of voter to make State block voting reasonable for both people and states, but that people aren't disenfranchised for choosing to live where they choose to live.

explainlikeimfive,fgfj67w,t3_ey720m,1580740190.0,"There are two questions in your question: What is a caucus, and how are party candidates selected?


> What is a caucus?

A caucus is one of two common method states do voting in the primaries. 

A *Primary* is what you expect. You show up on voting day, tell the nice people up front who you are, get a ballot, go in to a booth, and secretly cast a vote. 

a *caucus* is a public vote. You arrive at a set location at a set time, and when the time comes someone will go around and count how many people there support each candidate. Essentially it's a ""Raise your hand if you vote for Bill Bobson, Go to that room if you vote for Penny White"" or so on. Your vote is public, and you have to be present when it is counted. Leave too early, and your vote is not counted.


> How much control do the votes have vs. the Party?

This is a bit of a touchy subject.

So, at least as far as the Democratic party goes 2/3 of the delegates that select the nominee are bound by the results of the public vote. the remaining 1/3 are *superdelegates*, and represent party interest. They can vote however they want, but are not allowed to vote in the first round of voting at the party convention unless one candidate already has a significant majority. 

While the voters have a significant influence over the chosen nominee (and it's much better than it was before 1970) the Party has enough of a say that it can easily decide the race if it needs to. 1/3 of the vote concentrated usually decides over a split 2/3 vote."

Imagine a library, a very old fashioned library before the advent of electricity. You have all these books. How do you search for something in them all?

You use a card catalog. In one end of the library is a giant shelf with labeled shelves where you can put small cards in that tell you what books relate to the given shelf and where you can find it. 

Google works on a similar priniple. Using programs known as ""web crawlers"" or ""spiders"" that browse the internet and follow every link they see, they collect information about the websites they encounter and add them to a giant card catalog. Now when you search for ""Cat video"" they don't have to search the entire internet, they just go to the self that is labelled ""cats"" and ""videos"" and give you the most relevant cards that are in those selves.

No such key exists, and Google isn't 'special' in what they do, only in how incredibly well they do it.

todayilearned,fg9q1dp,t1_fg9kh7k,1580641818.0,"A ) The nation as a whole is in the middle of the ocean far away from common traffic. Until the advent of modern transportation *nobody* was going to Iceland for the views, and there wasn't much opportunity for a lot of cross-cultural interaction aside from the occasional fisherman populations (like the french or the basque which sometimes came for camp) and the danish merchant or three.  As such it was fairly easy for Icelandic to remain free from foreign influence. 

b ) It was always quite easy to travel between communities. While the highlands are a doozy to traverse the lowlands and the coast are fairly easily traveled on horseback. Social events (mainly the yearly Alþing) were common, so people didn't really form ""isolated"" communities like in other nations where two neighboring villages have a mountain range between them or impassable swampland. 

C ) Icelanders also were quite few, social, literate, and educated given the time, so standardized (semi) language is easier to come by. There was a tongue-in-cheek phrase by my old history teacher that goes ""Icelanders lived in turf houses, but they'd still come crawling out of their dirt hole and greet you in perfect Latin"". 

D ) In ""the old days"" the dialects were a lot more pronounced, as you'd expect, but never went much further beyond weird word usage, differing views on pronouncing certain letter combinations, or which vowel-rule-exceptions to follow.  but by the mid-20th century the population was mostly urbanized and better connected than ever, and the dialects common to Reykjavík started getting pushed rather heavily in schools, media, and general communication (understandably, given the 2/3 ratio of people living near the capital area and the advent of the radio and television). This increased connectivity and bias pretty much killed any significant dialects that strayed far from the norm. 

However they do exist, however petty they are. I f.i am originally from the eastern part of Iceland, and carry a 'dialect' named for a region named Skaftafell, but more formally is ""gi einhljóðaframburður""(gi monophonic pronunciation), which essentially just means that in the words vegi, stígi, logi, hugi, lögin, e.t.c I go  /vegi/, /stigi/, /logi/, /hugi/, /lögin/, instead of the more common /veiji/, /stíji/, /loji/, /huji/ og /löjin/: I keep the single sound as written instead of splicing a j or í like sound after the vowel. 


That's just about as far as pronunciation varyitiy goes. Some regions say certain sounds harsher or softer, voiced or unvoiced, or ignore or add exceptions to otherwise established spelling and pronunciation rules. If you know the ""standard"" dialect you're not going to meet a different icelander and be completely unable to understand him."

As a compromise however I got *really* good at dodging and counter-attacking."

The bastard clipped in to a pole and spent the entire fight running in place and attracting enemy fire. It was horrible until I figured out that Rom just wasn't interested in me and just kept trying to kill him stuck in the middle of a stone pillar."

Bloodborne is linear, but has side branches a' plenty if you go searching for them. 

However it is the only Fromsoft game I can pick up, do a mad sprint to the final boss in two hours, and that's that - a good ""casual"" fromsoft game when I just need a small dose.  Getting the achievements for the different endings isn't such a chore when you can power trough them in an evening."
AskReddit,fg4ctuf,t1_fg3xjn2,1580501035.0,"It was a pretty lazy port to begin with: the game is designed with a controller in mind and the mouse essentially acted like an overblown joystick and keyboard mapping was questionable. Some of the button prompts iirc didn't even display the keyboard controls.

Beyond that the control scheme and the quite fluid actions you sometimes need are easier when you've got two joysticks and a finger on each button. Because you don't really have as fine of an analog control over your movements when using a keyboard and mouse and it can be quite awkward to perform the required sequences if you didn't sit down and remap the darned thing you're loosing valuable time fiddling with the controls instead of dodging an axe to the head."
AskReddit,fg4cevx,t1_fg3wj1y,1580500782.0,"Depends on the genre. For shooters? Absolutely, go mouse all the way. For f.i racing games or games that are designed for joystick and cram in PC support later it can be vastly harder to stick with the keyboard."

Installing mods in offline mode is fine, but because your mods can directly give you an unfair advantage over the players you interact with modded games generally aren't allowed if you're online."
