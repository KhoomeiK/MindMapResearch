AmItheAsshole,ff2febb,t3_er97bo,1579503830.0,Nta I am sorry you are going through this. What they are doing is just plain racist. You need to report this to someone. None of what they are saying or doing is okay.

toastme,fewjvk4,t3_eqrw9r,1579412163.0,You're skin is the only skin you've got. Yours is unique and tells a story of survival. Love yourself. You only get one body and that body does a lot for you. So whatever it looks like own it and love it. When you are confident in yourself you inspire others. From what I see you are a beautiful young lady. Be an inspiration to others in your position.

Seattle,fej7h8k,t3_epfx8o,1579160123.0,This happens to us all the time. It's worse when it's the actual driver doing the unsolicited shit talking. We used to try to make a counter point but now we just ignore them.

AmItheAsshole,fcnvv1p,t3_ei5z0r,1577819465.0,"Nta she moved into a house with a dog. As for the financial issues I would check what your state law says and your lease agreement with her and go by that to the letter.
