nottheonion,ff3ayfy,t1_ff31b0d,1579537645.0,"Thatâ€™s exactly the point. Itâ€™s basic economics. There will always be a pool of unskilled workers, made up of high school kids, college kids, etc., and thatâ€™s good for businesses and those employees (and, indirectly, consumers) alike. The problem is that, when that pool grows too large, market forces drive wages down. Minimum wage tries to correct for that, and enforce a certain amount, which then encourages people to remain in the unskilled workers pool. The solution isnâ€™t increasing minimum-wage, itâ€™s helping people transition from unskilled to skilled labor, reducing the size of the unskilled labor pool, driving wages back up.

Now, thatâ€™s obviously much easier said than done, since it would involve massive revamps in our education systems, but itâ€™s definitely a much better long-term solution than artificially buoying up wages."

They didnâ€™t know that the driver was drunk and couldnâ€™t have known you were in danger. They should have (and did, apparently) refunded the trip and apologized profusely, maybe even offering you some kind of compensation as an apology, but they should be just as furious at the driver as you. 

Also, if you had been injured they probably would have been liable (hence why they should be furious about it), but the driverâ€™s insurance would have had to pay for most of the damages and medical fallout. Though, admittedly I donâ€™t know how Uber handles insurance.

My point is, I donâ€™t think Uber was necessarily the villain here, so since you didnâ€™t need the money (for medical bills or whatever) I think not suing them is the most ethical call."
