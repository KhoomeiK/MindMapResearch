todayilearned,ffgs58m,t3_etgk8a,1579913669.0,I imagine the battery capacity required to hold up the supply while the plant comes online isn't cheap tho?
todayilearned,ffgrxso,t1_ffgrgup,1579913519.0,"Oh Jesus that'd be a spectacle. I ho early don't know what it's do, but if it was big enough to store a decent amount of energy then it's probably be akin to a bomb going off if it broke apart whilst spinning. I'm guessing it would be very stable assuming no damage as it's have to be precisely balanced to ensure it doesn't shake itself to pieces whilst operating. If it fell over its probably go off on a rampage."
todayilearned,ffgrkyu,t1_ffgr41h,1579913262.0,Not too bad then assuming usage doesn't outpace rate of decay by a significant factor. O have some basic understanding of nuclear reactors but I do find all power generation to be fascinating.
todayilearned,ffgrek7,t1_ffgplzd,1579913135.0,"It'd probably be impractical, some of the solar farms in the UK are quite large, would either need some big covers or lots of little automated ones, but yeah it should work."
todayilearned,ffgrbtv,t1_ffgpo2d,1579913079.0,I meant switching solar in and out when required during the day. Have you tried ringing the sun? The bill would be astronomical.
todayilearned,ffgr9g7,t1_ffgqj0i,1579913032.0,"That's a pretty shocking fact. 
That's the battery in Australia that Tesla built I'm guessing? 
Nuclear is definitely needed as the base supply with a slew of options on top to sort out peaks. Hey you never know, maybe it really is only 20 years left till fusion XD"

todayilearned,ffgr26c,t1_ffgqlbt,1579912886.0,"Nuclear is the backbone solution in my opinion, it is definitely needed, but we need other solutions aswell. Reliable and widespread use of storage is something else required."
todayilearned,ffgqzcx,t1_ffgqmcd,1579912830.0,"Can be very easy to be snarky over text. I wonder what the length of time is before it would start to become a problem though, too much or something else."

todayilearned,ffgqrsr,t1_ffgqjbe,1579912680.0,"I think hydro storage is still supposed to be pretty efficient. For solar panels unfortunately you'd have to just disconnect from grid and dissipate power through something as waste heat. 
Hmmm I'm not sure fly wheels would be practical at any scale bug enough for grid purposes. A decent sized flywheel spinning at any sort of speed is like to flatten things if it breaks XD .you wouldn't want to be close."
todayilearned,ffgqkpb,t1_ffgq5xz,1579912538.0,Do they leave any waste after out of interest?

todayilearned,ffgqaft,t1_ffgq69s,1579912328.0,"Don't give them ideas XD let's not waste energy on mining.

todayilearned,ffgq18t,t1_ffgpx00,1579912145.0,"I meant from a turning it off and on for supply and demand point of view, yeah solar and wind aren't 100% reliable but still useful."
todayilearned,ffgpy5m,t1_ffgpp6v,1579912085.0,"I was thinking from a no power produced point of view, yeah unfortunately you'd have to dump the energy through something to dissipate it. Preferably used to pump water back up to a dam. Are they those radiator looking things installed on some houses roofs?"
todayilearned,ffgptn5,t1_ffgprbs,1579911997.0,Power output and lifetime seem to be inversely correlated above safe working levels.

todayilearned,ffgpa9k,t1_ffgp6tl,1579911618.0,"I don't claim to know all the exact reasons behind it but I imagine it's partly down to the immense heat generated in the reactor, cooling it down and heating it up too fast would probably be a bad idea."

todayilearned,ffgox2e,t1_ffgosth,1579911359.0,"Exactly yeah. It works really well and is quite simple in concept. Downside is available areas where this can be used, but is already being used to great effect."
todayilearned,ffgoryw,t1_ffgoma8,1579911259.0,"Yeah they linked wiki. I don't see why it can't work for solar, I guess to an extent it can't be turned off, well wind turbines can, solar panels can't to my knowledge. Nuclear definitely can't be turned on or off to meet demand quickly."
todayilearned,ffgon9v,t1_ffgob6d,1579911167.0,"Except I'm not recommending solar and wind to deal with peak, find where I said that. I'm for hydro storage batteries as we already use them and the technology is already there."
todayilearned,ffgojgt,t1_ffgoen7,1579911093.0,Oooh not heard of the concrete bricks one. 85% is pretty damned good. Definitely an interesting developing area.
todayilearned,ffgo111,t1_ffgntyq,1579910731.0,This is what they essentially do at some hydro dams.
todayilearned,ffgnynd,t1_ffgnugj,1579910684.0,You would have a lot of energy wasted that would need to go somewhere if you ran nuclear at a point that would take peaks into account.
todayilearned,ffgnvrg,t1_ffgnt2r,1579910627.0,"I agree with the mixture of all of them, what do you mean by non dispatchable?"
todayilearned,ffgnk57,t1_ffgna5o,1579910402.0,I'll give it a watch cheers.
todayilearned,ffgnj7b,t1_ffgn1rs,1579910384.0,"Right, because you somehow know more/better than the people working on solving green energy world wide. Simply put solar and wind are pretty easy to I stall on a small scale and are ideal in some areas, near equator for solar is pretty good, naturally windy areas, looking at you Scotland are pretty good for wind. Plus they produce no Easter. Nuclear does produce waste which, whilst isn't a problem as such for now, it is a problem that will need to be addressed down the line.
Hydro power is definitely limited by suitable terrain, doesn't mean it shouldn't be used where it is viable though. 
I have no idea why people seem to think there needs to be one mega solution to solve everything rather than a lot of complementing solutions."
todayilearned,ffgn6s7,t1_ffgn2ky,1579910147.0,"Yep, you can see it in effect on this site : https://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/"
todayilearned,ffgn3sn,t1_ffgmvbt,1579910089.0,"Whilst on paper it's sounds good there are practical implications to take into account. Hydro batteries require suitable terrain such as valleys that can be flooded, nuclear seems to take forever to build at the moment. Not sure how much battery capacity would be needed at a nuclear plant to give it enough time to come online."
todayilearned,ffgmqab,t1_ffglxge,1579909832.0,"Battery technology isn't quite there imo for mass storage for most countries, they are alright on small scale ISH for now but until we get away from needing rare earth metals I don't think we'll use them as the be all end all solution to peak power response. 
Using gravity? Do you mean some sort of weight that is hoisted up out of peak times and released during peak to convert potential into kinetic energy?"
todayilearned,ffgmjfv,t1_ffgltkv,1579909704.0,"Hmmm adding batteries to nuclear, almost like what I said about nuclear not being fast enough ramp up and down to be able to respond to peak times. Hydro electric pump damns that can also pump the water back up out of peak hours are basically giant potential energy batteries that can fulfil power requirements during peak hours."
PokemonGoMystic,ffgm4d5,t1_ffghmb2,1579909421.0,You and me both. I refuse to trade for it.
todayilearned,ffglkwi,t1_ffgkvz7,1579909055.0,"Nah, nuclear take too long to ramp up and down in order to deal with peak times. It's great for a base supply though."
