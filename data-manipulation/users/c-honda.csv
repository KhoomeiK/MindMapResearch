Spokane,ffg3xzg,t1_fffyfji,1579897932.0,"Right, and half of the community is against the smelter. The concern people have with the smelter on the river is that it will pollute the river with heavy metals, like what has happened historically just north of the border on the Columbia. And increased temperatures in the river which can make it impossible for many species to survive. And looking into it a little I’ve found that this smelter would be the 6th largest CO2 emitter I’m the state, and will also produce other greenhouse gases. 

However, it will be a silicon smelter for solar panels. Aren’t we trying to utilize solar more? We need smelters somewhere. It’s not a green job or green facility by any means, but I think the impact is minimal compared to what will be gained. I agree we should try and preserve nature as much as we can, especially up there that is my forest and river that I grew up in, I work for the forest service so yes I’m a tree hugging hippie, I love that forest mote than any outsider. But I just want to see my community alive, not even thrive or grow but just be back to it’s former self somehow, and we have that opportunity."
Spokane,fffvxpi,t1_fffuoy6,1579892973.0,"They failed because of labor being outsourced and the location of our town isn’t really in the center of trucking routes. 

As for why people won’t move away, they have been moving away to find jobs. But for them, and the ones who stay, they liked it up there because of the community. Someone who grew up in Spokane or Seattle or any city can’t understand the community of a small town. My teachers taught my parents, I know almost everyone who chooses to be social, not only do I know all my neighbors but they are like family, one of my neighbors is literally my cousin. Besides that, there’s much more freedom in rural places. 

I get there might be environmental impacts, but because of these reasons they are worth it to us. We are the ones who have to live by that river and in those woods, it’s very annoying when people who aren’t from there insist they know what’s best for our area. Best for the wilderness, yes. But Ill take change if it means my community can survive."
Spokane,fffqhvq,t1_fff9vjs,1579889600.0,"Good call me and my friends are gonna band together and launch a tar sands start up! 

Just kidding, but for real we live off the land up there. Everyone I know is either a logger, miner, dam worker, or random jobs like community support or forestry. And there aren’t enough people for any retail or tourism to be supported. In our heyday around the early 80’s we had a mill, mine, dams, and cement plant, and numerous little businesses to support those workers and their families. Almost all of it has been outsourced. We went from 60+ people per graduating class to <10."

educationalgifs,fff4knm,t1_ffet9ia,1579875536.0,">Dutch scientists Rob de Meijer and Wim van Westrenen suggested in 2010 that the Moon may have formed from a nuclear explosion caused by the centrifugal force of an earlier, spinning proto-Earth. The centrifugal force would have concentrated heavy elements such as thorium and uranium on the equatorial plane and at the boundary between the Earth's outer core and mantle. If the concentrations of these radioactive elements were high enough, this could have led to a nuclear chain reaction that became supercritical, causing a nuclear explosion ejecting the Moon into orbit.
