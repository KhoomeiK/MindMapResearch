You’ve taken so much offense from things I didn’t even say because you’re clearly more interested in finding a villain and playing a hero. That might make you feel good on Reddit but you’re hurting autistic people in general by giving the illusion of progress that isn’t actually tangible."
AutisticPride,ffx3953,t1_ffwxkfn,1580316814.0,"Look I’ll give you some context because I don’t think my tone is conveying very well over Reddit comments.

As an autistic person (I assume?) you’re going to do a lot of things that make a lot of non-autistic people uncomfortable. You’ll ask for lights to be lowered, say inappropriate things in meetings, laugh at things that aren’t jokes, or any number of actions that seem rude or crazy to the people around you.

When you do those things, you are relying on the good faith and intentions of the people around you to understand that the words you’re saying or the noises you’re making aren’t an indicator of how you feel. You’re going to need people on your side if you hope to survive in any capacity working with people.

This post here frames a problem as “I don’t like when people treat me this way” when the reality is, everyone around you is going to hate the way you treat them. It’s a lot more difficult for normies to understand autistic people than the other way around. That’s been my life story.

So noting all of the above, I am simply cautioning against subscribing to a victim mentality or framing the problem as autistic people being treated poorly. Once you turn the situation into an “us vs. them” argument you’ve automatically lost because there’s a hell of a lot more people without autism than with it.

I’ve got a bunch of autistic friends who get online and complain relentlessly about how they’re treated, but they never express gratitude for the patience other people are constantly showing them. It’s a two way street we’ve got to learn to get along with each other.

Does that make my point at least understandable?"

AutisticPride,ffwabot,t1_ffw92z8,1580292226.0,"All that energy worrying about words you can’t control is never going to positively impact your life. Ever. It is out of your hands what people say.

It tells them exactly who their audience is, their gender, locations, and more importantly: their age range.

If a YouTube person has grown a large channel, and then solicit nudes from their fans, it isn’t a coincidence when kids end up submitting things.

That is what he does. If you’ve seen any of his movies this shouldn’t have been a surprise, and I’d argue they probably chose him for that reason.

The only thing out of character was the final film where they literally went back and cancelled plot points. The other two were fine."
relationship_advice,fex7kuv,t1_few8j1n,1579426128.0,"I’m more disturbed by the complete blind faith Reddit has in some random adult hanging out with a kid for “reasons”. Where are the friends his own age? And why the heck is hanging out with this kid more important than seeing his girl friend?

Woo yeah the kid is having a hard time in life. Know who else has a hard time? Literally everyone. It’s not a unique situation.

sugarlifestyleforum,feww879,t1_fewg96b,1579420452.0,This is the correct answer. Literally free money that nobody pays attention to because it isn’t exciting or can’t blow up your savings overnight.

DQBuilders,feu34es,t1_fek88lx,1579382693.0,I don’t think so. I never found a way to do it even when I tried.
assholedesign,fet9xyr,t1_fet80nw,1579373140.0,That is not what is happening here. Look at the photo and tell me you would see that on Google.
niceguys,fet5ujz,t1_ferylxv,1579372111.0,Same! I thought the girls I dated were always terrible people because they were attractive so I was like fuck maybe I should lower my standards. Nope. Ugly chicks can be just as mean as attractive ones.
Games,feszmt4,t1_fesyv13,1579370483.0,"Oh, yeah I mistook what you meant. My bad.

That being said I’m still confused about the problem. If you’re a company and you want to interact with your users are you saying you should just ignore Reddit until they decide to make a community for you?"
