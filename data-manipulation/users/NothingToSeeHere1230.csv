Even the person I hate and she hates the most told someone about her cutting. Sure I was pissed, but it was our. Long story short, she got them to believe she was not cutting. So many of my fears run back to her harming herself (again) in any way. It’s so hard for me to step away from that. School isn’t much help either, at least for me. She jokes about it (suicide and self harm) far to much, I usually play along with it. But yeah, thank you."

wholesomememes,ffgfk6s,t3_etek96,1579905109.0,"*yeah, but then you worry so much about their problems that your own mental health deteriorating goes right past you and you don’t notice that you are slowly becoming more and more obsessed with helping others to the point where you can’t help your own problems and are empty without helping someone and can’t think straight half the time and when your alone you just want to leave the world and go jump off a bridge or cut yourself; speaking of cutting, one of my best-friends cuts herself and acts like it’s fine, plus I like her and that just makes it 10x worse*
