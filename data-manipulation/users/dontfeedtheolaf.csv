Art,fgdjshc,t1_fgc7gvd,1580683240.0,"Alright, it was a joke. I was just ribbing you. 

But since you have felt the need to post this, it says nothing about ""loose"" buns and it explicitly states you can't have flyaways. And the new instruction actually only states that the width of the bun can be no larger than the width of the back of the head, as opposed to the old 3 inch guideline. 

So I stand by my initial statement that the bun is out of regs."

mildlyinteresting,fg46w05,t1_fg46mp6,1580497403.0,No. It doesn't. It implies I don't know how many seeds are *normally* in a cucumber.
