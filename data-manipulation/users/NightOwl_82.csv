Just keep your distance and don't tell them your business.

Also I don't think they are having sex, it's way more manipulative than that.  I don't think exposing them is going to do any good as these types of people will find a way to turn it around on you. Your ex will probably down play the relationship and make out that you two only went on one coffee date or something. 

If anything get a totally new person, to expose them, stage it and get a drunk or outspoken friend to expose all at your next family party then she can sail of into the wind as she isn't involved anyway (obviously plan it out with her first) this way your hands are clean. You gotta think like them."
