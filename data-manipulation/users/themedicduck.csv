A brush engine might be very heavy duty pickup truck with the equipment and pump and such placed into the back of it versus a structure fire engine which is a custom designed vehicle usually but cannot do as well on off-road without being chained so there's benefits to either.

todayilearned,fd3yqt9,t3_ejwxed,1578162833.0,"My biological father abandoned me after I turned 1 when he and my mom divorced.   Then later tried to act like I didn't exist.   Wasn't paying child support. This dude never told the ARMY that he had a kid.   My step father (see: real Dad) ended up chasing him down using some connections he had within the service (he was in the coast guard) and asked some questions as to why sperm donor wasn't paying child support.   I guess when asked if he had a son up in Washington state his reply was:

""I don't have a son up in Washington state""

Yea.   He later came back and left my life a few more times.   Abusive in ways that were not physical or immediately traumatizing but as my therapist later helped me work through in the past couple years was the reason I had so much trouble establishing my own confidence.  Also self hatred, depression, self doubt, issues trusting male authority figures or supervisors and absolutely no will to take chances on anything.   I realize I cannot simply blame all of my difficulties on an absent or toxic father but to be honest (and according to my therapist) a high percentage of my personal troubles are a direct result of it.   And the ones that aren't are the mistakes I've made but even then ""if a house is built on bad foundation, even the stuff that happens after will still be in the pile when the whole thing collapses"". 

Last year I cut off communication with him.

Told my stepfather I consider him my actual father.

And my life has improved because of it.  


I have 3 children that know beyond a doubt (well the youngest is only 3 weeks old) that their daddy will do anything and everything he can to take care of them.  They love playing with me.  And they know I love them.  

TDLR:. Abusive and absent father inspires Son to be a better father and husband in ironic turn of events.   


Morale of the story: Gentlemen, love your kids.  Pick them up.  Change their diapers.  Play with them.  Make them smile.   Celebrate them.   Yes they will need discipline sometimes.   Yes they will drive you nuts.    It does not matter.   You made them.   You raise them.   


They are joys, not burdens."

college,fcjll0l,t3_ehd52i,1577692672.0,"Pffffft kid I'm 32 and a freshman.    I'm usually the oldest student in the class.    For about the first week it bugged me.   Then I remembered why I was in COLLEGE.    Not high school.   I'm not here to make friends.   I'm here to get a damn education and move on to a career I'll enjoy.  Them calling you old man is a sign of immaturity and honestly would you really rather force yourself to be friends with immature people?   Let's be real, you're 25.  Not 45.  So what?   

If a 19 year old feels the need to remind me who the old guy in class is, I just smile and agree with them.  I am older than them.  But I ain't dead.  And quite honestly, I'm happier at 32 than I ever was in my 20s.   

My dude, be a leader, rise above it and set the tone and example for the young fawns to follow.   Let your work ethic and passion for what you do speak for you.  


Oh and about the balding thing.  Just own it.  Break out the razor.   Bald is beautiful.   Hats are fashionable.  Whatever man.  Just means you won't have a bad hair day.   Added bonus: bed head is never an issue.  Shave that thing, keep the lotion up and maybe it might change your perspective.  


Remember, you're preparing your future.   You have so much ahead of you.   Graduation, career, success, maybe a family.   Maybe even kids?   I have 3.  Joys of my life man.   There is so much more to think about than if you've impressed the local frat boys.
