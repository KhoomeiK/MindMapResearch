Showerthoughts,ffqaxhi,t1_ffq9r0o,1580128697.0,"Yeah I think schizophrenic people who are hearing voices are usually convinced it's because they're part of something.

As in if they did a test, they would conclude from the test that they do have superpowers"

Actually I have no idea"
news,ffmifcb,t1_ffmbd3v,1580055169.0,">Yeah most of those systems have people dying because they can't get to the front of queues or the required medicine/procedures are not covered publicly.

That is complete bullshit peddled by places like fox news. Show me any evidence of this. All the people I know from other countries say it's not true. Wasn't true in the other country I've lived in either."

Not only that, but that they wouldn't even tell you the price beforehand."
news,ffm9xs3,t1_ffm97oh,1580051127.0,"Yes you can say every system has tradeoffs but every other first world nation does not have people dying of preventable disease simply because they're poor. That's a uniquely american problem and to suggest we can't fix it by changing the main difference between our system and the successful systems ludicrous. It takes either massive ignorance or complete disingenuity.

No one is suggesting doctors work for free by the way"
OldSchoolCool,ffm8xqy,t1_ffm573s,1580050636.0,Yeah you could just charge the flash and smack on something. I'm sure I pisses off a lot of people when I found that out

todayilearned,ffm39ti,t1_ffm158b,1580047769.0,"China has slightly *more* ships, but the number of ships is certainly not the most important metric. And you are most definitely wrong about the usefulness of aircraft carriers."
todayilearned,ffjql8j,t1_ffjpuq1,1580004411.0,"Even though in a fairly different vein, I feel like jojo rabbit navigated this kind if thing fairly well. It was capable of making you feel sympathy to those in nazi germany without making you feel like you sympathized with the ideals of nazis.

I'm sure there was some blowback about it but I for the most part have only heard good things and the criticism that I have heard about it has mostly been that the critic simply didn't really care for it, not that they found it offensive"

todayilearned,ffithj8,t1_ffi7m6b,1579982315.0,"Yes a lot is two words but alot is used quite a bit these days and the the two words will probably merge at some point if the prescriptivists don't mess it up.

Some other words that will probably become official:


Everyday (technically two words unless you mean ordinary)


Alright (technically still all right even though other ""all"" words have merged)

Nevermind (also technically two words)

Note: these distinctions are mostly for more formal writing. Something like texting or social media these changes have more or less already happened. There's a lot more examples of two words becoming one or hyphenated words becoming a single word but somehow I'm drawing a blank."
