Same shit was happening to me, the city installed one of those rain gutter right in front of my house that basically catches all the debris blowing down the street. Also I have a high school across the street and kids would throw snack wrappers, empty soda bottles and random paper all the time. 

After I contacted them and complained, i've gotten a lot less tickets."

I just scuffed and said bro, i'm from the bronx. Not some fucking tourist just because I'm walking in time square."

todayilearned,fg5vwio,t1_fg5ojfu,1580541079.0,Yeah 250K is only after you've been there for at least 4+ years and survived the 2-year culling.
todayilearned,fg5valo,t1_fg5f36p,1580540336.0,"I would say access is another thing. I took a summer course at a city college, the library closes at 9pm. Good luck trying to find a research project for the summer and the class admin. office was like waiting at the DMV. 

At my regular non ivy but tier 1 private school, you get assigned an admin. counselor and you can set up an appointment. If you request an official grade transcript, it will be sent that same day. 

I was interested in working on a research at a particular science field so I cold called the department chair's office and schedule a 15 min meeting. He was the chair of the dental surgery department and probably makes 600K a year but still took the time to meet me and help me get into a lab.

We had a departmental library that was never meant to be 24 hrs but students would stay anyways and you would just open the door if anyone wants to get in. Well, one night, nobody was in the library after the doors locked and one student went and complained to the school. Instead of being mad that the library was being used after hours, they actually programed the key swipe to allow any student id to have access 24/7. Also keep in mind that the campus already has 2 libraries that closes at 2am and 1 huge computer lab/ study space that's open 24 hours."
todayilearned,fg5ur1u,t1_fg5cm46,1580539690.0,"It's definitely the connections. I had friends who got the converted summer associate/intern job at big finance companies just because they went to my school. While the majority of people in that same summer program had to go through grueling interviews and applications. Basically if you don't screw up, you will get offered a job after you graduate and get your foot in the door."
nba,ffs1w2c,t1_ffr4waw,1580171108.0,I read somewhere from another copter pilot that most pilots pass the instrument rating but never end up using it so that skill just erodes. Makes sense since most pilots don't fly above 2500 ft in that area due to nearby airports.
AskReddit,ffrlltp,t1_ffrhhmo,1580160562.0,I dont think I've ever seen the designer and architect eat the cost? Doesnt it usually go back to the owners?
AskReddit,ffrleej,t1_ffr90bw,1580160438.0,But now designer have a blurb on their drawing that says the drawing is to show intent of design and may not show everything or some bullshit like that. Currently have a drawing where they want us to save the drop down ceiling. Except the grid is 2ft x 2ft and we need to demo and install hvac ductwork above it. No way in hell is that ceiling grid going to be saved.
AsianParentStories,ffppywh,t1_ffc0x9y,1580101673.0,"Whatever money she gives you, you can do what you want with it. If you have kids, are you only going to spend half on them and expect your spouse to come up with the other half? Makes no sense. It's all family money at that point. 

Don't let something so dumb stop you from getting married. Same shit happened to my cousin but now that they are married and have a kid, the parents have all quiet down. All that pre-wedding fuss was for naught."

worldnews,ffhrpv3,t1_ffhm4jd,1579950424.0,"I read a post from a doctors perspective. If you dont take the bribe, and the patient dies, the family will blame you. They will think perhaps you were insulted by the low amount of money this why you didn't take it and why their relative died. That you did it on purpose. Its all sort of fucked on both sides."

Queens,fel40p5,t3_eh8uev,1579213584.0,Has anyone ever beaten a sanitation ticket before? There was one time way back in 2010 we got a ticket for not having the trash can covered. The guy that did our trash was a veteran so he replied online saying that he is a veteran and he is paid to do the garbage and there is no way the trash was uncovered since the trash can has a self closing lid. That was the only time I've seen a ticket dismissed.
nyc,fel33nz,t1_fehy11y,1579213014.0,I always see them in corona right outside the subway with a table set up. They will give out free promotional stuff and have Spanish speaking people manning the table to try and dupe people who dont speak English and dont know their way around the system.
