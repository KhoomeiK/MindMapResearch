AdviceAnimals,fdhtgn8,t1_fdhqseh,1578429859.0,The same is true for BoH. Dishwashers and line cooks all have terrible turnover and don't get any benefits aside from maybe a week off a year. Yet they keep enough staff to keep running. If anything this proves my point. If you aren't getting enough and the restaurant can't retain people they will be forced to increase your benefits and pay. If a restaurant can't do that they can close up for all I care.
AdviceAnimals,fdfsrya,t1_fdfrmzx,1578369300.0,I wasn't implying you didn't have a degree. I don't believe you have a PHD in food service...I was simply showing you that a server does not do 30 dollars an hour worth of work. A cook does arguably the same or more work and gets paid half that. Why is that fair? In an office the receptionist deals with the public but doesn't get paid 2x as much the people at the desks. 30 bucks an hour is as much as a manager makes and they have way more stress and hours worked than a server.
gaming,fdfp87k,t1_fdf2b4b,1578366921.0,I like to think there is only 1 law to the universe and that is that the universe will always attempt to be more complex than its previous state. Nothing becomes something. Something becomes 2 things 2 things become 4. We start with energy...that becomes matter...we flesh out more and more complex matter and energy. Once we explore the limits we move on to life...the most complex form of matter currently. The universe is no longer bound to pre determined paths...the matter can move independently. We explore the limits of life eventually humans emerge. Intelligent life...the most complex form of life we know. We are now fleshing out the limits of intelligent life. Evolution is no longer random as we take control of what evolves. The next step? Created lifeforms... designed rather than randomly surviving. Perfected over time the torch of complexity will be passed on to our created race...which will be the most complex form of intelligent life.
AdviceAnimals,fdfnczg,t1_fdf6kyh,1578365691.0,25-30 dollars an hour is in the realm of what people with a degree and years of experience make. If you were truly worth that you would find a high end restaurant willing to pay you that. If you don't think what your boss pays you is enough...congratulations! You are now like every other person who works for a living. Not trying to shit on you for taking advantage of the tipping scam...hell i would serve too if i could stand it. Unfortunately I would rather destroy my back than deal with customers because i hate people in general. Many servers would not want to do my job either so i don't see one as superior to the other.
gaming,fdfmk67,t1_fdfj1bi,1578365167.0,Imagine the universe a billion years in the future...I like to think the sheer amount of time of civilizations starting ...some ending. Even if 1% of them can move onto the next stage and can survive with technology just collecting matter rather than being tethered to a planet. I like to believe slowly we would populate the universe with diverse groups of intelligent beings. As long as planets keep getting made and destroyed there is a chance.
AdviceAnimals,fdet4a4,t1_fde95ll,1578346048.0,There are many jobs who require a person to deal with the public. None of them get tips. Why are servers any different?

AdviceAnimals,fdd9rsc,t1_fdd5ofz,1578301496.0,I don't...I hate companies reaping profits off of the backs of their workers. If we got rid of the tipping system employers might be forced to pay a living wage. Why are you fine with thousands of companies making money paying the least amount of money they can short of slavery and asking the customers to directly pay their wages? It's a system designed to circumvent tax laws and ensure their employees don't get any benefits. You think its great because you get a cut of the scam but it doesn't make it any less of a scam. Serving is a hard job and i respect hard workers but your employer should dictate your wage based on your performance. You shouldn't get paid less because some random customer doesn't like you or for that matter more because they do. I'm fine with a stripper getting tipped because its part of the show and is voluntary. If tipping your waiter was voluntary based on someone thinking you deserved it thats fine but I shouldn't be forced to tip..if i don't you don't get a wage and I'm an asshole. Tipping should be a bonus not your staple income...and nobody can survive on 3 bucks an hour. And dont tell me they get comped up to min wage because if you always did that you would get fired.

AdviceAnimals,fdd4wy4,t1_fdd1lfr,1578294943.0,He is afraid to say he will lose his part time panhandling gig. He doesn't want to refer himself as a freeloading hobo so he puts on an apron and acts like what he is doing isn't begging good people for spare change. He also realizes that with tips he gets paid way more than the work he is doing and doesn't want to lose the scam he has going.
AdviceAnimals,fdd4pc4,t1_fdd0k8v,1578294683.0,Good. Usually when a business can't pay their staff they go out of business why is this any of my problem? Do I get a profit share for subsidizing their business model?
AdviceAnimals,fdd4l9s,t1_fdd1nlt,1578294547.0,I like to call them hobos. They are begging for cash like a bunch of streetwalkers. Every server in this thread is tilted because they know their whole career is a sham kept afloat by panhandling. These lazy fucks make more money and work less hard for their money and they don't want the teat to dry up. Bunch of freeloaders...thats why I don't eat at places with waitstaff often.
AdviceAnimals,fdd4fcm,t1_fdd0qfn,1578294346.0,No you idiot he's pissed that he has to pay someone's wage instead of the business that they are working for. Its not about how much you pay its about a business doing its job and paying its employees. Why are you defending subsidizing a businesses profits because they are too lazy to pay the servers themselves.

trees,fd6t0xb,t1_fd6pjav,1578195348.0,"I am perfectly responsible for myself. If I'm stoned and driving recklessly how do they prove i was stoned? That's why I don't need a cop taking my blood to find out i smoked 3 days ago and get a DUI. You don't understand how harrassed you get as a stoner. My whole problem with this is they are giving out DUIs with zero ability to determine without a reasonable doubt that people are intoxicated. Laws made out of emotion end up ruining the lives of average people. If I disagree with the cops assessment I go to court and the judge takes the side of the cop 100% of the time. So even if you smoked 3 weeks ago you have a target on your back. The fact that the laws are being set is infuriating. Its not as simple as ""don't drive high"" After years of police harrassment I have zero faith in the legal system and if we give these pigs an inch they are going to take a mile."

trees,fd6l9ob,t1_fd6k9f9,1578192673.0,Don't give me that bullshit the police only want to use this as another way to make money off of peoples misery. They don't give a fuck about safety. If I'm stoned and driving recklessly then give me a ticket for reckless driving. If i forget to use my turn signal and the cop needs to meet his quota he will try to ruin my life with a felony when i was posing no danger. YOU are the problem the state has enough power over my personal life DON'T GIVE THOSE GREEDY FUCKS MORE POWER.
trees,fd6jvzf,t1_fd6fzp5,1578192157.0,It baffles me. I have driven high for 14 years and never had a traffic accident. The cops don't give a shit about safety they just want another way to profit off of ruining peoples enjoyment of their lives.
trees,fd6j2bo,t1_fd6hftl,1578191799.0,I could ask you the same question. It's idiots like you that make us normal people have to fear enjoying our lives because you give a green flag to the state to fine us and ruin our lives when we are doing nothing wrong. I have driven for 14 years on and off smoking nearly constantly and have never been in a traffic accident. Now why should the cops get involved in something that is none of their business.

videos,fcwvndk,t1_fcwk93w,1578039522.0,Hell even working in kitchens you are better off lifting weights outside of work because its the same...busy making basically 5-10 plates of food every 10 minutes if you are steady. And if you are busy you have anywhere from 25-50 orders stacked up for hours and you have to coordinate and drop all the food that takes the longest then finish the plates one by one. Usually spend 4-6 hours doing this non stop...no smoke or bathroom or even getting a drink of water. Then 15 minute break (that I had to fight for and made it a standard) followed by closing down and cleaning the mess hoping its slow enough to do before close. The worst is opening heavy drawers at your feet 5 times every 10 mins so you have to bend over and pull on the heavy lowboy drawers so often it really strains your back. I hate when people trivialize restuarant work as easy....shits hard on you.

gatesopencomeonin,fcmf8c5,t1_fcm5m5v,1577773067.0,That was why i went with subs to start and still enjoy them. I feel like because in Japan anime is a lot bigger so they spend the resources to get the best VAs. The dub studios don't have the same talent to pull from and i would rather hear the best i can find. That being said I have seen quite a few good dubs in recent years. Castlevania is one that comes to mind
worldnews,fcme6s2,t1_fcm9uua,1577772034.0,She bankrolled the DNC and you see no connection to how that is advantageous? The simple answer i can give you is she couldn't convince me to side with her simply because she is the continuation of a party that is too right leaning for me. Honestly most candidates I see are unqualified to do the actual job because before they even enter office they are only representing maybe 5% of the population. I would rather us have no president than 99% of the people who have ever ran for office. I was a hard no on her from the start and any other evidence of her character just adds a layer the steaming pile of shit.
worldnews,fcm9dv9,t1_fcm8gr5,1577767780.0,I don't have to provide evidence because I saw what she did to Bernie. If she can't even win fairly in an election what does that have to say about her character? Politics is as much about the person as their polices. She showed her true colors time and time again just look at her entire career. You couldn't possibly prove to me she isn't corrupt so I don't think either of us is in any position to judge.
worldnews,fcm8pq3,t1_fcm47et,1577767234.0,The sad thing about both of them is they have a few good points. Especially Peterson when he isn't discussing politics. I watched some of their videos when they first became popular and I liked them as they gave me a different way of looking at certain issues. Eventually I watched enough and their religious views started eeking into their speeches and I just couldn't bear to listen to it anymore...once you enter emotion and spirituality into your logic it immediately turns to dogshit.
worldnews,fcm888s,t1_fcm64yv,1577766840.0,Just because someone is an expert in their field doesn't mean they can't be corrupt. She would put in whoever is seems qualified that she can control and whoever the money decides will continue their interests. She wouldn't hire anyone who would defy the money interests in favor of the working citizen. Therefore she is just as big of a shitbag. You can't convince me otherwise.
worldnews,fcm7pnb,t1_fcls4a8,1577766425.0,Haha ben was so upset with him. I would love to see more interviews like this across country lines.

worldnews,fcm5y2u,t1_fcm3fdm,1577765081.0,We have more than 2 options whether the population chooses to accept it or not. If 1 and 2 are shit i will vote for 3 in good conscience. If the entire country decided to do this instead of not voting we could still have 2 main parties but we could make a 3rd party into a main party and force the now 3rd party to reevaluate their position.
