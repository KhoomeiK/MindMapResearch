I dont think youre bad a person. I think you just need to think more about how other people feel. But I accept your apology."
mentalhealth,fcjnt6p,t1_fcjnmpv,1577695686.0,"Yeah; that was me. Its fine, I accept your apology.

You shouldnt feel like that, no ones ever fully incompatible with society. Im autistic so I get a feeling of never fitting in properly. I dont blame you for finding it frustrating though, but you should try and think about how others might feel when they dont fit in rather than writing something mean.

A message sent to someone at a bad time could really hurt them. Even earlier... when I first saw your message I felt really awful and I nearly fell back into a panic spiral, but I was lucky enough to have calmed down to a point where I could cope with it.

You should try and find a better way of expressing your frustrations. I think maybe speak to a professional about not fitting in, since most of the behaviour Ive seen from you makes me feel like you might be autistic too."
mentalhealth,fcjnfm3,t1_fcjnbtb,1577695157.0,"Its fine. I know theres something really bad bothering you at the moment and thats why youre having to release your negative thoughts with bullying.

Im glad you're sorry for saying what you said though. You need to think about who youre being mean too though as if youd commented earlier when I was still in my panic attack I mightve handled things much worse and you couldve made me fall deeper into my anxiety. Something small can have a big impact on a vulnerable person, or anyone if theyre in a bad enough situation."
mentalhealth,fcjnays,t3_ehcgsm,1577694983.0,"I like lying down and listening to sad music. If Im feeling too depressed to be happy, then sadness is generally easier to achieve, while also being preferable to the lowness and emptiness I tend to feel while depressed. But then I end up thinking about a lot of things I dont want to have to worry about, so I havent been able to rely on it much.

Recently, Ive found myself doing more stuff with my siblings, since they are close to me and friendly. Sometimes being with someone close can make me feel happy even during a deep depressive episode."
mentalhealth,fcjn749,t1_fcjn1f2,1577694836.0,"Thats what I expected your situation would be. Im not very happy with you accusing me of faking my panic attack in another thread, but despite that I want to help you however I can, since I know how bad mental health problems can be.

What kind of negative thoughts are making you so angry and aggressive? Im sure theres a way of better expressing them rather than being mean to others."
mentalhealth,fcjn330,t3_ehfpnq,1577694686.0,"That is honestly horrible. I feel so bad for you. What kind of monster would go and do that to you?

Youre really amazing for being strong enough to post everything, and Im really sorry someone did that to you.

You can tell me in a reddit chat if you want, and Ill believe you. I know exactly how spending hours crying and spiralling can feel as I suffer with that a lot, although probably not as badly as you. You sound like youve been through a lot."
mentalhealth,fcjmtk2,t3_ehj8qe,1577694318.0,"To be honest, I can see why you hate yourself so much. Looking through your post history, youre a bully and really not a nice person. I have a similar issue, hating myself constantly, except for me its different since I have much less to hate and most of the things I dislike about myself other people do like.

Even if you really are a bully though, that doesnt mean you should have to feel depressed. There will still be people who care about you. Im just not one of them. But I know what depression feels like and I wish you luck getting through it."
mentalhealth,fcjmkz9,t1_fcjma7y,1577693997.0,"Wow... Im sorry...

I was just... its hard to explain until youve actually had a panic attack but you dont really think normally. You get stuck with these ideas infinitely looping in your head and its hard to think of anything other than them. I was just trying to put my thoughts into words.

Im sorry I offended you so much."
mentalhealth,fcjkb92,t1_fcjj4n5,1577691048.0,"Thank you for being nice and not telling me earlier. You were right, I wouldnt have been ready to hear it. Its still kind of a shock now... Im clearly pretty bad at boundaries too, but Ive never had really any relationship experience before.

Im really glad theres nothing wrong with still caring about him... it felt weird at first because I still care about him a lot, but if its normal I dont feel so unusual now. Im too scared to talk to him yet... but I might look and see if hes okay in a few days.

Ill try and keep myself safer from now on. Thank you again for all the assistance youre giving me, its really helping."
mentalhealth,fcjj3s7,t1_fcjiwzl,1577689575.0,Thank you. Its really nice of you to remind of this. Now that Im feeling calmer I can see more easily how important my own health is too.
mentalhealth,fcjj2as,t1_fcjizsj,1577689524.0,"Thank you. Its hard to explain how I felt back then now that I feel a bit better, as I dont want to go back into that state again... but it really felt like I had caused him to love me even though I clearly couldnt have."
diet,fcjijj8,t3_ehf1bc,1577688933.0,Broccoli is horrible but very good for you.
mentalhealth,fcjidxi,t1_fcji6eh,1577688759.0,"Really? It was really working on me... I was terrified, I felt like hed die if I left him. He apologised for it later and said he was more stable... but I was in such a bad panic attack by that time; I just couldnt think straight.

I still feel so bad for him now... even if he was being unreasonable... but Im too scared to even look at me and his messages because I know Ill have another panic attack if I do. Even if he was being abusive, I cant help but hope hes okay."
mentalhealth,fcji73y,t1_fcjhwjy,1577688550.0,"Thank you... its a bit easier to think that way now that Ive calmed down out of the panic attack I was having earlier.

It still kind of feels like I caused all of it... so I dont know if Ill ever truly forgive myself for it, but its easier now to feel like I mightve done the right thing."
mentalhealth,fcjhv3k,t1_fcjhlq8,1577688183.0,"Im sorry about that... it just ends up happening when I have my panic attacks. I get it sometimes with just general anxiety but its worse with the attacks.

Its fine, the anxiety is one of the few conditions Ive had for years and Im generally better at dealing with. But then again, its been seriously bad these last few months. Ill try and take care now, thank you!"
mentalhealth,fcjg7my,t1_fcjfsli,1577686439.0,"Thank you, your post has actually helped quite a lot. Especially the bit at the the top, since that is completely correct and I feel a lot less bad now. Im calmer too now so I can see things with a clearer perspective."
mentalhealth,fcjbxp9,t1_fcjbolz,1577682522.0,"Okay... at least itll be less painful for everyone else if I hide it. Two years isnt that long, Ive survived four months so far. If I can hide everything from my family for four months I can hide it from everyone for another 24.

Thanks for the love... even though I dont deserve it after everything Ive done. Ill remember that youre here for support, but Ill try not to use it."
mentalhealth,fcjbji1,t1_fcjbdwh,1577682197.0,"I cant... my family will find out and I dont want them worrying... as itll all be my fault when I inevitably end up hurting them.

Its safer just to hide it... Ive managed that so far."
mentalhealth,fcjb67b,t1_fcjayqx,1577681902.0,Thats what I used to think... but telling people has never worked either and it cant be much worse. I just have to be strong enough to hide it for 2 years... then Ill live on my own and can get help without anyone finding out. Until then... I just have to act normal so no one worries about me.
mentalhealth,fcjawyh,t1_fcjarcl,1577681697.0,I can... I did before... Im sure I can do it now... even if it hurts me more than anyone.
mentalhealth,fcjahd2,t1_fcja6wj,1577681359.0,"I know... but it doesnt matter now much it hurts me. As long as everyone else is happy... thats all that matters. I wouldnt keep a broken arm to myself... but thats only because I cant hide it... I can hide being depressed and my other mental health issues.

I cant take care of myself when it causes so much trouble for others. I just want everyone to be happy."
mentalhealth,fcj9x7h,t1_fcj9mjt,1577680933.0,"Only if I tell them... if I keep lying and dont let anyone find out then everyone can happy. If I tell anyone theyll just get hurt, thats what always happens. Ive hurt enough people. I cant do it anymore."
mentalhealth,fcj9gz8,t1_fcj8p4d,1577680599.0,"No! I cant... if I do that Ill just end up making more people care about me and worry... then Ill end up hurting everyone and making things worse for people. Ill ruin more peoples lives and cause even more trouble than I already have.

I understand now... the only way I can keep going is if I keep it all to myself. I cant let anyone else find out... thats how I stop hating myself... I just have to stop hurting everyone."
mentalhealth,fcj87vy,t1_fcj6ij8,1577679740.0,"I dont know... I never though this would happen to me... I dont know what Id say to anyone else either.

I know I havent controlled his feelings... but its my fault he loves me. And it my fault we met. We met online after he saw me posting about a depressive episode I was going through on another forum, and he helped me a lot back then. But then we became friends... and then he fell in love... and now I feel so anxious when I even think about how I dont know what to do.

Thats why I had to break friends with him. Its my fault. If I hadnt told anyone about my problems he never wouldve met me. And I never wouldve become his friend. And then he wouldnt have fallen in love. I caused this. I ruined everything because I couldnt keep holding in all my thoughts and had to tell someone. If I was stronger and didnt talk to him, I never wouldve hurt him like this.

I know theres something wrong with me and I need to talk to a professional... but I cant let my family find out how horrible my mental health is right now. If I got a therapist, theyd find out. I just have to keep going on my own and not tell anyone... thats the only way to stop myself hurting everyone with my own problems. Then I wouldnt hate myself so much. Then I wouldnt ruin everyones lives."
mentalhealth,fcj7b4p,t1_fcj5j23,1577679057.0,"How can you be so proud of me? I dont deserve it. All Ive done is hurt someone because I was too weak to keep helping them. I ruined everything for him. I was the one thing that made his life worth living and I left him.

He wasnt trying to push his emotions on me... he was just going through a lot... and I couldnt even be there for him. I feel so awful. I shouldve helped him. I shouldve done more. I shouldnt have abandoned him. I shouldnt have even let him fall in love with me.

I shouldnt even talk to people. Thats what Ive learned. Everyone who makes friends with me gets hurt, and its all my fault..."
mentalhealth,fcj6aho,t1_fcj4zi6,1577678327.0,"Yes it is... Ive ruined it all just because I was too weak and let my anxiety overpower me...

I shouldnt have let him fall in love with me. Thats when everything went wrong... I made him love me when I shouldve just not talked to him... or anyone... that way everyone can be happy.

I cant not hate myself now. I cant ever forgive myself for this. Ive never felt so heartbroken in my life, but this is entirely my fault. I dont know what to do anymore.

Ive ruined someone elses life. Ive always felt that way during my panic attacks but now Ive done it for real and it hurts so much..."
mentalhealth,fcj4qum,t1_fcj4gik,1577677243.0,"How could I not feel bad!? This is all my fault. Im a terrible person for doing it. But... I couldnt stay with them either... I dont know... I just know I ruined everything.

I dont know if I did the right thing or not. But its the thing I did and now I have to hate myself for doing it forever."
diet,fcip32g,t3_ehdw2n,1577666479.0,"I have no clue why you arent losing weight. 1000kcal is dangerously low even for a woman. (I know from experience. At 1000kcal you should be feeling ill and weak, thats now bad it for you it is.) You might want to see a doctor, as you should be losing a lot of weight with such a low input due to the amount of energy youll need just to maintain your (sorry to be rude) very overweight body.

Id try and make sure everything you eat is healthy and replace the low fat yogurt with a low-sugar alternative. Id also work on doing exercise to make yourself less sedentary since its healthier."
diet,fciinlb,t3_egzbhx,1577663184.0,"Thats... interesting. The problem is if you have the willpower to only eat one thing after hitting your limit, you probably have enough willpower to just stop eating after hitting your limit like I did."
diet,fciihi0,t3_egysay,1577663105.0,"Unlikely that you were in starvation mode unless you have almost no fat and eat under 1,200 calories a day. Its actually harder to trigger than people think, as Im eating way less than 1,200 a day but Ive got enough fat that its not activating.

Water weight could be a reason, or perhaps youre just gaining less muscle and therefore managing to lose weight."
diet,fcii3k9,t3_ehcibf,1577662910.0,"Basically you just need to not gain weight. If you want to lose it, you just need to keep a calorie deficit."
skinsTV,fcequs2,t1_fccvile,1577622934.0,I havent seen her later apparently but that totally sounds interesting.
SuicideWatch,fceq8id,t3_eh1btb,1577622821.0,"Thats brilliant. If it makes you feel good, keep it around.

Im so glad youve found something that can help you."
SuicideWatch,fcb10gg,t3_egtss4,1577580572.0,"I expect youre already gone by now... but on the off chance you see this, please give life another chance.

Ive had 4 failed attempts now, and each time Ive been saved by someone else being there for me, but I couldnt be more happy to have survived each time. If I hadnt, I wouldnt be here.

Things have got better for me and I know they could be better for you too. I dont know how to help with your problems but I know there is a solution out there for some of them, and while things may never be perfect... Im sure you can find a way to be happy."
Anxiety,fcb0mbh,t1_fcaxiiq,1577580325.0,"Yep. I definitely get that.

My anxiety effects other things too though, most importantly is the fact that Im starting to have to face my fears and accept that despite everything Im telling myself Ive developed an eating disorder, but its made so much harder that Im just panicked about it constantly until I decide to ignore the problem and just pretend nothing is wrong again. Its becoming so much of a problem now that its eclipsed all the other issues Im dealing with, but if I wasnt made constantly anxious I wouldnt have to worry about it anywhere near as much."
Anxiety,fcanw6w,t3_egtm4o,1577573001.0,"I have something similar, but not for leaving the house, its mainly about facing problems with my mental health. That irrational voice will come up with any excuse to stop me accepting my mental health problems and make me not look into treatment for them.

Its really hard to deal with, so you arent alone."
Anxiety,fcanokk,t3_eguyhl,1577572874.0,"While I do have an anxiety diagnosis, I assumed this was normal since I always suffer from this. Almost every day even. I once had a panic attack because I was so worried about waking up, thats how bad it can be sometimes."
SuicideWatch,fcancf1,t3_egv10x,1577572678.0,"If you are still alive, please go to a hospital. You can survive this if you are quick enough. At least call 999.

When you survive, reply to or message me. I might be able to help with your problem as I have the same issues with thoughts racing through my head often."

I don’t blame you for finding it frustrating though, but you should try and think about how others might feel when they don’t fit in rather than writing something mean.

A message sent to someone at a bad time could really hurt them. Even earlier... when I first saw your message I felt really awful and I nearly fell back into a panic spiral, but I was lucky enough to have calmed down to a point where I could cope with it.

You should try and find a better way of expressing your frustrations. I think maybe speak to a professional about not fitting in, since most of the behaviour I’ve seen from you makes me feel like you might be autistic too."

I’m glad you're sorry for saying what you said though. You need to think about who you’re being mean too though as if you’d commented earlier when I was still in my panic attack I might’ve handled things much worse and you could’ve made me fall deeper into my anxiety. Something small can have a big impact on a vulnerable person, or anyone if they’re in a bad enough situation."

Hopefully it will, yeah. I especially hope it goes well for you. Just try your best and keep an open mind, that’s the most anyone could ever want from you.

You’re welcome, I’m just here to help."
diet,fc4eodf,t1_fc4e309,1577414482.0,"Seems legit. I’d recommend adding more fruit then, plus maybe the occasional snack if you aren’t too full."
diet,fc4ek7o,t3_eg3yld,1577414390.0,"It won’t work very well no. As Bryan, the other commenter said you’ll be very weak and tired. Without a good source of energy, as either fat or carbs, you body will just end up with a deficit. Even eating lots of vegetables won’t cure it, although it might help somewhat.

Also, the exhaustion is awful. Trust me, I know from experience, as I’m doing a generally low-everything diet right now to lose a lot of weight fast, and it really does feel awful."

diet,fc4dyi2,t3_eg0q2c,1577413892.0,"Sorry to be annoying, but why do you want to gain weight? If it’s to be muscly, you want to work on exercising and eating healthily. If it’s just to be less skinny, then I’d try to find stuff that’s healthy but also sugary, like fruit."
SuicideWatch,fc4dops,t1_fc4cdxy,1577413664.0,"That’s good! You’ve found some happy memories at least. I have a lot of bad ones too, especially from 2019 and 2016, but as long as there’s some good it’s okay to me.

I don’t know to be honest if anyone is truly happy. I used to be a really happy person, but the last 6 years have kind of taken that away from me. Maybe it’s just part of growing up, as it was as I got older that my life started to fall apart, the foundations of everything that made me happy and forget all the bad stuff got eroded and finally collapsed this year.

I’ve definitely met some generally happy people. Everyone has ups and downs, good periods and bad ones, but there are happy people still. Some people just manage to look at the good side of everything. I find children are generally the most happy, but part of that is just because they haven’t realised how bad life can be, they have a very different perception to use and tend to only see the happy stuff.

You should look forward to 2020. It’s a big year, the start of a new decade, and maybe this decade can finally be the one where things start going right. Maybe your new year’s resolution could be to try and be happy this year? I know you can do it."
SuicideWatch,fc4bu9p,t1_fc4a5n8,1577412161.0,"Yep, that could do with a bit of work. I’m sure you did something worth while in the 2010’s though, even if it doesn’t feel that way. It was a total disaster of a decade, the latter half at least, but to me it will always be important since a lot of big things happened to me in them, like getting my GCSE results."
mentalhealth,fc497v8,t1_fc48449,1577410055.0,Really? Maybe I should read this then. I have bad enough anxiety to get a diagnosis so maybe it would do me good.
mentalhealth,fc47vu3,t1_fc47l4x,1577409003.0,"I might try and read it. My death-anxiety isn’t as bad as OPs though, I can still live a normal life mostly. I just get some bad panic attacks and it can be hard to manage some days."
SuicideWatch,fc47req,t3_eg26es,1577408905.0,"All I can suggest is explaining to your GF. At best, she can help you feel better and carry you through dark times, like some people I’m close to do with me, and at the absolute worst there’s nothing stopping you from dying still.

I know you can make the right choice and not give up on life yet. Just talk to your GF a bit before doing anything... you shouldn’t give up without trying other options."
SuicideWatch,fc47it0,t3_eg359h,1577408718.0,"Mine can be. Quite often it’s a minor thing that doesn’t matter at all in the grand scheme of things, but it triggers my mind to spiral into loads of horrible thoughts, which causes a panic attack, which then overwhelms me with everything and I end up really suicidal."
mentalhealth,fc47ea9,t1_fc3uy1i,1577408620.0,"That’s interesting, because I have the same problem as OP plus an anxiety disorder, but I lost my sister when I was really young, not even 4 years old. I went to the funeral, so one of my first memories from being a 4 year old was the funeral, which meant that I never quite forgot or moved on from losing them.

Maybe that’s where my death-related anxiety comes from."
mentalhealth,fc479i2,t3_efzv14,1577408518.0,"I have an anxiety disorder, and I can totally relate. To the point where I literally cannot think about death without it suddenly triggering my anxiety and causing panic attacks, which like with your problem often leave me crying myself to sleep. I don’t really know how to help though... but try to remember that life goes on even after losing someone and in most cases people who die have already lived full, happy lives. A death isn’t necessarily the end of the world.

What I usually end up doing to pull myself out of panic attacks related to this is just realising that just because people I love will die doesn’t mean I have to be crying myself to sleep now. I can be happy, and should make the most of whatever time I have left with them. It’s still hard to deal with, and I can rarely prevent panic attacks before they happen, and the sadness that comes from remember I could lose everyone can cause trouble with family events, but it’s more manageable when I think that way."
diet,fc3amqb,t3_efqmii,1577385513.0,"Drinking a lot of water can help. As can finding distractions. Or brushing your teeth with mint toothpaste to ruin the taste of food. I’ve also heard good things about gum since it can make you feel like you are eating something when you chew it, and also give you the same minty taste as toothpaste to make other stuff taste weird, but I’ve been unable to test that. I’ve also heard carbonated water is good since it can make you feel fuller. After enough time without eating (about 12 hours for me) nothing will work, and then you just have to endure the hunger.

It’s kinda hard to find a good method. Keep trying things, you might find something, although from my experience the best method is just to be super dedicated to losing weight and remember that losing weight is worth being hungry for."
