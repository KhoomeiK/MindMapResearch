This makes it difficult to focus on anything other than what's directly in front of you. Our votes don't even really count for anything. I don't see revolution as an actual solution until the country is completely and irrevocably bankrupt. There are surprisingly few elected officials trying to change the system, and anytime they try, they are immediately shut down by the majority who benefit from the broken system. The forefathers actually saw this coming, and left explicit instructions to revolt, but fat chance now that literally anyone on the planet can be turned into pink mist by a chair force warrior while he sips his morning coffee."
