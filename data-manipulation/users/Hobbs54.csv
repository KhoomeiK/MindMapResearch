aww,fcv5spj,t3_eiyvyy,1577995236.0,"Very much reminds me of my old dog Bru, short for Bruiser.  He was half [Bouvier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvier_des_Flandres) and half mystery date mom had when she got out one day. Bru was a solid meter high at the head, inch long canine teeth and his ""woodgrain"" coloring was for stealth attacks. When I would call him in after he had been out back for a while, he would always follow the fence line as he made his way back to the back door. I would see him clearly when I called, then once he got moving you were never sure if you could see him or not against the weathered wood fence. It reminded me of Star Trek and how a cloaking device would only be detected by distorted background stars.  If he wasn't such a sweetheart he would have been terrifying."
