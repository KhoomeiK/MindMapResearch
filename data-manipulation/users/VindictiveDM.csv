actuallesbians,fewr5i6,t3_eqt6m2,1579418261.0,I had a bit of the opposite problem actually. I had only been with women but for some reason i was craving being with a man. Its weird because im like 90% attracted to women and 10% men and id  never felt like that before. Sometimes you just want what you want even if it makes no sense to you. It might just be that the fact youve never experienced it is just making it seem more appealing or it could be a lesbian awakening. A lot of lesbians i know started out thinking they were bi then realized that they only really liked women. Either way you need to do something about this or the desire is only going to grow and ruin your relationship
