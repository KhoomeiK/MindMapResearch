wholesomememes,fg0rdus,t1_ffzs0nd,1580413524.0,Sounds like a lot of y’all just want something to be outraged about ngl
wholesomememes,ffzps9x,t1_ffzoty9,1580389261.0,"I interpreted as he’s complimenting the fact that he even wore the hat, not that it’s not ugly."
wholesomememes,ffzpnm8,t1_ffzi7v6,1580389144.0,"It’s not lying, it’s just acknowledging we all have insecurities and if someone is willing to express themselves in an outgoing but unusual way- that should be celebrated.

In the comic, he’s not even lying he’s just complimenting him on the fact he even wore it. If anything it’s just about conformity."
AskReddit,ffykn6e,t3_evnzey,1580348693.0,"As a white male, what annoys me most is when other white men feel they’re being persecuated in modern America because other groups are receiving equal representation and opportunities and norms of the past of having white men in positions of importance- whether it be on TV or in real life- are being deconstructed."
OurPresident,ffyesre,t1_f6m9jne,1580344705.0,The working people not getting the chance to vote? Sounds like a problem which benefits the Republicans. No wonder it’s still in practice...
doctorwho,ffyd1h9,t1_ffxogb8,1580343516.0,"No, it’s very clear in the episode she’s talking about the Earth. It doesn’t even make sense in terms of Gallifrey, since Gallifrey is located closer to the center of the Milky Way.

I guess what doesn’t make sense here is that she kind of makes it seem like it’s some random galaxy when it’s been established that Earth and Gallifrey are in the same galaxy. Likely that’s just negligent writing."
doctorwho,ffycswy,t1_ffx2wrq,1580343355.0,"Same, I’d rather it be a Pre-Hartnell Doctor. And personally, it isn’t shitting on the lore or legacy of the Class Doctors, since none of them even remember Ruth and probably regard Hartnell as their first incarnation.

I think there are some definite plot holes with New Who showing the Doctor steal a Tardis, and how it’s shown the Doctor as a Little Boy but either we’ll have to disregard that or it’ll all be explained in some vague way.

I think it’s certainly interesting if they went the another regeneration cycle route, and I wouldn’t lie especially if they twist it into some evil Timelord plot."
doctorwho,ffybw1v,t3_evtbq0,1580342744.0,"Well, the Doctor introduced in this episode likely isn’t a future incarnation so I don’t see how it would relate. Rumors and details from the episode itself suggest it’s actually a past Doctor, likely before Hartnell. 

However it would be cool had they introduced a new Doctor that way, but it’s kind of similar to Capaldi showing up in the 50th Anniversary, granted we already knew he was the Doctor though."
doctorwho,ffyb8lz,t1_ffxcefw,1580342310.0,It’s a gif and it was probably taken from an Instagram or Snapchat story.
trashy,ffxooo4,t1_ffx1c1u,1580329394.0,"It doesn’t matter what *is better* it matters if they consented to this or not... which he didn’t.

Just admit you’re wrong, swallow your pride and move on. Perhaps change your mellow, sadistic outlook on life while you’re at it. It’s an unhealthy way to think, fixing it might really affect your social life. ;)"
