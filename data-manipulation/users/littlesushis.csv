AskRedditAfterDark,ffnnong,t3_eubc6t,1580068237.0,"since I've only had one partner so far I can only tell my experience from him and to be fair, I expected way worse and was very pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste as bad as I thought it would, but that I actually liked it. still one of the reasons I'm insecure of my own taste/smell is because his is so great."
Minecraft,ffnjltd,t3_euac5j,1580066812.0,shaders really make a huge difference. would you recommend using them for casual playing or does it slow down the game by a lot?

sabaton,ffly6wm,t3_eu5fkw,1580045603.0,"This sabaton concert was the very first time I had ever gone to a metal concert before. I felt so overwhelmed and was absolutely shocked by how nice people were there. I saw a guy getting out of the moshpit with a bloody nose and people all over were offering him napkins, at the same time I also fell down quite a lot and people would pick me up like it was nothing. Definitely one of the greatest times of my life and would definitely go to a metal concert again. People there are like angels."

AskReddit,fcjsrja,t3_ehg5ac,1577702842.0,"I had planned to go with my sister to a festival in summer. We've been there before and it was pretty boring but we wanted to go because we liked a band that was playing (free entrance btw).
The night before we went I had an awful nighmare where my sister was chased and someome tried to kill her.
We didn't go, turns out on that day someone was stabbed at the festival."
