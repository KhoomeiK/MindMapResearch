bikewrench,ffewacy,t1_ffereqv,1579868188.0,you might just have not pushed firmly enough on the pads.  Pushing the pads back with the bleed port open might cause oil volume to gush out that you didn't want to gush out and this could leave some bubbles in the master cylinder's reservoir which would lead to the a mushy lever feeling that often shows up when you hang the bike or when you flip the bike upside down.

bikewrench,ffces3d,t1_ffcakkp,1579797905.0,"your comment reminded me that I forgot a critical step!  will edit - clean with isopropyl, then lube with mineral oil.

bikewrench,ffcbnaq,t1_ffc56a5,1579795953.0,"It's possible the lever got pulled with the wheel (or red spacer) not in place in which case, you could likely push them back in gently (as described above).  You could also just ride them and let the pads wear and over time the gap will open up a bit since the pistons won't auto adjust for a small gap so it will eventually 'fix itself' if you don't mind riding it as is until then.

but pushing them back in should fix it.

It is also possible (though unlikely for a new bike unless it was assembled from a kit) that they bled the brakes with the pistons already extended a bit.  In which case, see my *caveat in the above post."
bikewrench,ffc48wk,t1_ffby5bg,1579791150.0,You make a valid point about if you bled the system with worn pads in place.  Of course the official instructions have you bleed with the yellow spacer in place so it should never be the case.
bikewrench,ffbtdog,t3_esoie9,1579782045.0,"There are several posts that are either flatly wrong or just incomplete in this thread and some of it will result in damage to your brake.

1. You DO need to push the pistons back in because they have gradually worked themselves out to compensate for pad wear.  This is a normal feature and replacing brake pads always requires this.  There is a correct way to do it.  Read below.
2. You **do NOT\* need to open the bleed port** anywhere on your system.  For the same reason your brake was able to extend the pistons out bit by bit to compensate for pad wear, they can go back in as long as the lever is not pulled.  There is a bypass around the lever piston that allows this fluid to circumvent the face of the piston when the lever is in the released position.  This is BASIC hydraulic brake operation.  Adjusting how far the lever travels before it closes off the bypass is also known as ""free stroke adjustment"".**\*** The caveat to this is IF you have performed a bleed on your system without the yellow bleed spacer placed in the caliper.  This would mean the system has more fluid in it than it's supposed to - filling both the bypass reservoir and the extra volume behind the pistons.
3. BEFORE you push the pistons back in, remove the pads and use a q-tip with isopropyl alcohol to **clean the edges of the piston** where they are exposed.  If you push the pistons back in without cleaning, you will also push all the accumulated brake dust, road grit, dirt, etc back in.  This can damage seals over time and can ruin your caliper since the seals are NOT a user replaceable part.  Your photo shows that yours are VERY dirty.  Make them shiny white again.
4. BEFORE you push the pistons back in (but after cleaning them), **drip a bit of mineral oil around the edge of the piston seal**.  This helps lube it as it slides back in.  A single drop on each piston will do.
5. After cleaning the pistons use a **plastic tire lever to push the pistons back in**.  Push on the pistons as flatly and evenly as you can.  DO NOT touch the pistons with anything metal.  The pistons are ceramic and you will damage them with the tip of a screwdriver.  You can also put the old pads back in and then use a big flathead to push them apart, allowing the old pad to protect the piston.  You want to push them until they are flush with the caliper.  You'll see that they want to fight each other (push one in, the other comes out) so spreading them evenly at the same time helps.
6. Finally, after getting them back in, **insert the new pads**, then insert the red pad spacer and pump the brake lever a few times to set spacing, then you can mount the wheel again and you're done."

This might seem like it fits you well since it brings the levers and where your hands rest higher and closer but it has some other effects too.  Mainly, it means your brake lever is now at a very awkward angle so that fine control or even emergency stopping is compromised due to the sharp wrist angle required to grip the brake lever.   Also, it kinda makes the bar tops unnecessary.  You've effectively reduced the usable hand positions and your ultimate flexibility on the bike.  Try rotating your bars back down to a normal position and see if using the bar tops and suicide levers makes more sense as a 'comfort' or 'rest' position while the bar drops are now a usable aero/control position and the hoods somewhere in the middle."

It's becoming common to find this inner width clearly specified on a product's specs, but if not, this number is often given as an etrto spec like ""622x17"" somewhere on the rim or in the rim's spec sheet would mean it is a 17mm inner width."

bikewrench,fdqr84q,t1_fdqn36u,1578673149.0,"Funny story here...  Shimano always used steel or titanium until they released their first 10spd group, 7800.  The FH-7800 freehub (and associated WH-7800 wheelsets) had the new 10spd only aluminum freehub which was \*narrower\* than the existing 8/9spd freehub but also had much taller splines, which let the aluminum work well without gouging.

The market spoke and lack of backwards compatibility was a problem so the 7800 hubs were quickly replaced with 7850 which went back to a 8/9spd width, traditional spline height, and back to titanium to resist gouging.

But like you said, ""muh grams"" are not compatible with steel (and ""muh dollars"" are not compatible with titanium) so you see tons of aluminum freehubs shaped like the 8/9/10 freehubs.  Of course they gouge.

There aren't many titanium freehubs out there (White Industries, Shimano, Onyx I think).  Some brands combat the gouging on aluminum by putting steel plates on the leading edge of the spline (e.g. American Classic).

Should anybody care about gouging?  If you think how carefully the shift ramps, divots, etc on the cassette are aligned to help the chain shift, and then you let a couple sprockets rotate a couple degrees, that kinda sucks.  In practice, it's a very small effect, but when you're paying $texas for a drivetrain and expect it to shift perfectly, might be worth getting everything right.

SRAM actually combat this phenomenon pretty successfully with their monoblock cassettes, and of course XD Drivers and Shimano's new Microspline freehub add gouge resistance."

bikewrench,fca12nr,t1_fc9qztt,1577561297.0,"> On my most recent wheelbuild I finally just ponied up for DT Swiss Squorx nipples and their T-handle driver wrench. They're more expensive, but since nipples are so cheap anyways it works out to only a couple more bucks per wheel.

Yessir.  I've gotten to where I will only use these for my own builds.  I *love* the T-handle for initial lacing and tensioning.  I build wheels at a Trek dealer and the majority of Trek's in-house wheels come with Alpina nipples which are similar to Squorx (but hex headed instead of torx headed).  Definitely makes building nicer."
