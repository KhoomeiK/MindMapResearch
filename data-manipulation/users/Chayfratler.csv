politics,ffa9755,t1_ffa1sui,1579730334.0,"I voted Johnson, but my vote was literally a not Hillary vote. I wasn't a fan of Trump, but he was unknown as a politician. I just thought he was a dbag. I hated Hillary, and would have voted for pretty much anyone else on the ballot."
nottheonion,ff42czf,t1_ff393b7,1579554029.0,"My job is similar. I'm an engineer, but the value of my job is flying to job sites and overseeing installation of our structures. I make sure everything arrives as designed, coach the crews on how best to assemble, and generally just put out any fires that may arise. When I'm back at the office, I have little projects for process improvement pop up here and there, but it's not busy all day like the guys in the manufacturing facility. They see me and know that I don't work hard like they do, and I know it too. I try to help when I can, and I handle calling contractors or electricians and just generally aid in keeping the place running smoothly, but I have plenty of time to dick around on reddit. I don't feel guilty though, because when I'm needed on site, I'm needed. The amount of money that goes into these projects, and the amount I can save with tips or solutions is worth well over my salary."
GetMotivated,fehm3aj,t1_fehlcc3,1579119313.0,"Totally agree, and you summed it up well with winning but still feeling bad about the team. My biggest issue was the inability to beat far inferior teams by more than a few points. Sure we were technically having a decent amount of wins, but the fact that our non conference games were still like 21-17 didn't make me feel like we were a powerhouse. This year was totally different. When you play a nobody school, and you want to claim you're the best, it's expected to put up 40+ points and win by large margins. We never did that with Miles."
GetMotivated,fehkz86,t1_fef8qpm,1579118667.0,"Yeah, I was in the fire les miles boat, just because I was sick of watching us put so much talent into the NFL that we never used. The archaic and boring offense of just running up the middle, with the occasional qb option was never going to win. I thought we would hire Jimbo, or any other candidate over O, and now I'm so thankful that we didn't."
GetMotivated,feelwxg,t1_fedo84d,1579036415.0,"I was pissed when we hired him. I thought he wouldn't amount to shit. I ate crow after the texas game, and haven't looked back since. Couldn't be more proud of the guy."
sports,feekm7t,t1_feddojm,1579035657.0,"Burrow also sat out many 4th quarters, as well as just hand offs because the margin of victory was so large. He could have easily put another one on Clemson, as well as most of the other teams he played."
sports,feekgeu,t1_fecvlt8,1579035563.0,You're missing one major piece of the pie. No one gives a fuck about whatever conference Hawaii plays in. Burrow did this in the SEC with is basically the NFL farm league.
LSU,fee7wp6,t1_fee27fc,1579028233.0,"I agree, which is why I think it's a problem with the whole system, and not just LSU. Low common denominator and popular things are always where more money is spent. It's the reason more money is put into hair restoration than cancer research. Plenty of money goes into shit like reality tv, so I don't have much of an issue with spending money on football players, especially since they're the ones that earn the money and essentially play for free."
LSU,fedxmwd,t1_fedhlhj,1579022053.0,"While that's a sad fact, it's more of an issue with the system. I believe LSU get's like 10 million for winning this game. Football is the only sport that brings in money, and if you want to keep doing that, you need to have cutting edge shit to get recruits. Universities are a business, so if there's a problem it should be with the industry, not LSU."
LSU,fedhl4f,t3_eolre7,1579011716.0,"What an epic season! So proud of the guys, and to be a tiger. Joe Burrow will likely be the best LSU qb I see in my lifetime."
tifu,fdhkbe8,t1_fdh5ckf,1578424462.0,Honestly all the lube I've gotten from sex shops sucks and is 4 times the price. I'd rather ky or astro glide any day.
