I’ve found the hardest thing for me isn’t starting the book it’s finishing the book, so if i dedicate myself to reading 1 page a day, i’ll begin building the foundation for better reading habits.


Often times getting started is the hardest part, doing one little thing helps new habits less intimidating.


Some Examples. I’ll pick up this weight once. Practice this 1 scale. Read this 1 page. Focus on making the most of this 1 day. Reach out to one friend. Make 1 new plan for this week. Eat 1 vegetable.  Meditate for 1 minute etc. etc."
selfimprovement,ff0oeaw,t3_er2pnj,1579470767.0,"It sounds like you've come a long way in defining what it is that you want for yourself, and what you want out of a relationship. It also is good that you've pinpointed what you need to focus on in relationships, finding the balance between being compassionately involved with someone while also not being overbearing or smothering. Now with the Yoga teacher... Once you've established a good enough foundation for the beginning of a friendship with your yoga teacher (just casually chatting after class for example) if she really suits your fancy, casually asking her out to coffee, or a bite to eat wouldn't be extreme, and could be the first step in forming a relationship. 

now more importantly what's this 'weird' music you've been listening to?"
nosurf,fekm601,t3_epigdp,1579202933.0,"not directly a benefit, but it continues to surprise me how little i miss it. I'm still interested in finding new ways to get creative that aren't so interconnected with FB or the social media aspect of things. The app 1SE (1 second everyday) has helped scratch that itch somewhat."
socialskills,fe5nvfj,t3_entk8t,1578871980.0,"to form more meaningful relationships i’ve been doing two things recently

1)

I’ve been trying to do a better job trying understand what the people I care about are REALLY thinking and feeling, which usually entails asking clarifying or contextual questions, or asking them to repeats something or rephrase something i dont fully understand. Watching street epistemology videos as well as reading “crucial conversations” and have helped me with listening, as well as have better political discussions (I’ve been getting better at listening, still working on being interesting to listen to but that’s another story)

2) making plans with the people i want to get to know better, and following through on those plans. Lets say i’m talking to my friend and she says she wants to spend more time being creative, i can suggest we go to a local coffee shop and draw for an hour. She may say no, but it’s still nice to be asked. Making plans can make any conversation more exciting."
selfimprovement,fds4zfk,t3_emxola,1578694475.0,"I’ve also been spreading myself a little to thin, collecting too many self help books without finishing the ones i already have. Or subscribing to too many self help subreddits. I unsubbed to a lot of em and am down to 8 and my time on reddit feels far more focused and productive. I should probably make a commitment to finishing one book before i’m allowed to go out and buy another lol"

selfimprovement,fdlrrjz,t3_em0cnr,1578530942.0,“you aren’t responsible for people’s reactions to you making the best decision for yourself.” Is great and i’m keeping it
selfimprovement,fd6zp7l,t3_ek6n7s,1578197700.0,"Electric Toothbrush. Getting a weighted blanket to help sleep. Getting a library card for the Libby app is big, especially with all the self help books worth going through. No longer checking social media as a part of daily routine. Turning on flux on my phone. If i can think of anymore i’ll add ‘em~"
