And because she used the term ""fan"", the second person basically tells her ""it's not about being a fan or not, it's vaccines, not a boyband"". I hope it's a bit more clear!"

I hadn't done it before because of money issues and fear I wouldn't manage it because time was passing, and it had become such a huge wall in my life. I'm really happy I finally got it, and it was immensely satisfying paying for it myself! (in France, the driving license costs around 1100-1300€, up to almost 2K in bigger cities)"

AskWomen,ff18xt5,t3_eqxs0f,1579476420.0,"I think the main thing my parents did right with me is that they respected me as a person in and of myself. They treated me like a child when I was a child and when I was acting childish, but I quickly understood as a teenager that if I acted respectfully and maturely, they treated me like a mature person in return. This has resulted in very different things with each parent, but both are beneficial: with my dad, I can talk about culture / politics / music etc for hours, and with my mum, I know that I can confide myself in her and she will give me advice like she's talking to an adult, not just her daughter (I'm nearly 27 now, but that's been true since I was 14/15)."
acne,few1b92,t3_eqqy09,1579404052.0,"Hi! Like I said in the title, my skin has always been sensitive and pimple prone, but for several months now, I've had a surge of acne. I've gone through several sorts of routines. For a long time I used either Laroche Posay or Avene products because of my sensitivity, but they were never balanced enough between my sensitive skin problems and my pimple problems. Then I wanted to try something a lot more natural and organic, but the products I used weren't a good fit. I also tried a bunch of other things over the years, from store bought big brands crap to pure organic products, but I never get a pretty skin.
So for a couple of weeks now I've been trying the ""caveman regimen"". I saw it mentioned on Reddit and thought it was worth a shot. It's worked reasonably well in getting rid of the active pimples (the one over my lip is red because I've just fucked with it) but I'm not sure it's really sustainable on the long run for a skin like mine. I'm planning on seeing a dermatologist but it won't be for several weeks or more likely months, and I don't know what to do in the meantime. Any help would be really appreciated (especially with products I can find in France / Europe).
My current caveman routine is just micellar water, rose hydrolat in a spray and a bit of tea tree oil on pimples, morning and evening. 
As a side note, I don't smoke, I'm not often in the sun, I very rarely drink alcohol, I drink water throughout the day (although not always 1/2 liters) and I eat very little sugary / greasy food. 

Thank you to whoever will read me and hopefully direct me towards a better routine <3

wholesomememes,fem6bn6,t1_fem4xys,1579241300.0,"I'm very sorry for your loss and for the end of that relationship... although the fact that you're able to rationalise the reason it ended a mere few days ago is a good sign, it means ultimately, it was for the best, even if it's not obvious right now. I hope you can start on that path too, best of luck. Give it time, things will look up, I promise."
wholesomememes,fem188m,t1_fem0oyv,1579236468.0,"I know, it's so hard, and even when you think you're kind of there, there are still days when you'd gladly punch yourself in the face for sucking so much. But those days become rarer as you make a habit of taking time to forgive yourself, to tell yourself that it's okay to fail and to not feel enough sometimes. But you're all you have at the end of the day, so you have to be enough for yourself. To achieve that, you need patience and  maybe to work towards a version of yourself that's closer to what you'd like to see when you look at your life. And if sometimes you need to shut out the world and think ""fuck everyone"" (maybe don't say it out loud too often) and just focus on your own wellbeing for a little while, so be it! You're all you have, you have to be enough for yourself. And you have to GIVE yourself the chance to be enough."
