toastme,fec9l26,t3_eo8r4x,1578969092.0,"You do look feminine. You have full lips, pretty cheekbones, and gorgeous eyelashes. I totally get not feeling feminine because I didn't hit puberty until I was 13 and looked very boyish, giving me an identity crisis until I was 15, but you are very beautiful and definitely have feminine features."
teenagers,fec996v,t3_em3as7,1578968910.0,"I get this man. I'm a junior and dated a guy for two years. I hate that he's still on my mind sometimes but I just have to accept it... Even if everything I do in my daily life reminds me of him. Going to school, caring for my fish, coding, everything reminds me of him in good and bad ways. I listen to the music I like (and Breaking Benjamin happens to be one of my favs) and remember how he made fun of me for it and made me feel bad about it, then I start coding and think about how supportive he was of it. It's honestly soul crushing but you can do it. Teens can feel love. I have no doubt we can love. I've loved, you've loved, I will love again, and you will love again. She definitely shouldn't try and make you hate her but at least she's not trying to lead you on. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this because it's the worst feeling in the world. You pick out baby names, you plan out pets, you learn to do things for them like cook or clean. You plan out a whole future and the future is *real* to you. It's a fact. It's a hard fact and cannot be changed. That *is* your future, just like how the sun *is* a giant ball of gas. It's like someone telling you that grass isn't real. It just doesn't make sense. When it was real for so long it's so hard to convince yourself that it isn't real. You will get better and someone will appreciate you and love you for who you are."

Aquariums,fdc6xbi,t1_fdc47v0,1578268296.0,Definitely. My Goldie tank is planted and so is the shrimp and Tetra tank I set up for my sister.
Aquariums,fdc43ef,t1_fdc2xov,1578266715.0,"After we set up a rank for my sister for Christmas (tetras and shrimp and the tetras had a couple babies which we just discovered after about a week!) She became a little hooked. She didn't care too much about my goldfish but she invested her time and money to help me despite not seeing the value in it, but boy did she fall in *love* with my sister's shrimp and tetras. For her birthday (which is the day before mother's day this year) I plan on setting her up a shrimp and tetra tank. We haven't moved my sister's tank to her dorm yet and my mom will sit there for literal hours watching them. They follow her around now outside of the tank. She got so excited she also bought like 6 more tetras for my sister's tank (there were 2 then those had babies, ate all but two, and then the mommy fish got eggbound and didn't make it) and mom was absolutely heartbroken. We held a funeral service for the tiny ember tetra and my mom cried. She doesn't do her research on fish which is unfortunate because she loves fish so much. I'm planning on getting a 5 gallon for some shrimp and tetras to sit on her desk in her office at home. She's so sad we have to return the cat fish who she named Spotty. I can't afford to buy her a big tank because I'm 16 and jobless and don't have time for a normal job right now because of home and school (my mom and I live alone together) but I'm enlisting in six months on my 17th birthday and I already plan on saving up for a nice tropical tank for her. It'll take a while to save up but with the money I make from drill I should be able to save up within a few months. She definitely has fallen in love with the hobby (which my ex boyfriend got me into and we dated for two years so honestly I get kinda sad caring for my fish sometimes since it just happened) and so I haven't been super interested in talking about fish with her. I didn't realize until today how into it she is until she got so sad that we have to return Spotty. Maybe we can ask the lfs to hold on to Spotty until we set up our new goldfish tank and Spotty can have the 20 gallon until we can upgrade him because she's so sad and it breaks my heart :(

We do have a problem with her impulse shopping though. One time I needed new shoes for school because the soles of mine were duct taped on and I was begging for new shoes but instead she bought herself 6 pairs of heels that she ""needed"" for her business suits. We also got three cats we couldn't care for and one got eaten by coyotes right in front of me over the summer because she didn't want to get him fixed and put him out when he started spaying. She doesn't care for the animals she gets and so it's frustrating with her buying fish without knowing anything because I'm so careful before getting any animals"
