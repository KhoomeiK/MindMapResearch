funny,ffc1nx1,t1_ffajfv1,1579789280.0,"I remember going up skiing in high school and it was super cold. the tourists all left when the frostbite warnings went up so lift lines were short. it was a lovely day to ski. I was coming down and launched off a headwall and did an amazing back-scratcher. it was a thing of beauty until I caught my ski tips and catapulted into terrible face plant and skidded like 40 yards. broke my nose, it was a total yard sale. 

when I collected all my stuff I realized I was covered in blood all down my front, the nose, the face, lots of bleeding. amazingly it was so cold it didn't hurt... yet. it was so cold that pulling down on the jacket popped all of the blood off since it froze instantly. grossest ice ever.

I went to the medical place, while waiting I thawed out, then it hurt. they set my nose. that hurt badly. I skied the rest of the day. my parents were horrified when I got home, two black eyes, ice burn across my face, broken nose. but anyone who skis can appreciate the sound of your skis Ssssshhhhhhing on the snow and hitting a jump and then silence as you fly... I just held that back-scratcher a second too long. I paid the price of Icarus and all who aspire to flight with too much hubris.

anyway, ice burn is very painful and ice is often dirty so it tends to get infected.

funny,ffbyhpj,t1_ffb2v19,1579786793.0,"wow. I grew up in Colorado and one winter we got insane snow in a short time span (like six feet \[2 meters\] in three days \[three days\]). it shut down everything in the first few days, on day three roofs started to collapse from the weight. every building with a flat roof (think mall and school) paid people to shovel the roofs off to avoid collapsing. so while no one could go to work we found work shoveling instead.

grocery stores and liquor stores stayed open on limited schedule. but what I remember was the snow berms from people shoveling their sidewalks being too tall to see over (and yes, the USPS still delivered so everyone shoveled mostly for them). I don't remember fines but there was little reason to leave the house.
