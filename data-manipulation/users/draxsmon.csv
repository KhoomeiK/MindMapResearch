BreakUps,fg159s6,t1_fg0huek,1580421017.0,I think they are just that fucked up in the head. Also not everyone has a conscience. Mine told me he tries to  put him self in other people shoes to see how they feel but it doesn’t really work for him. That’s not scary at all
BreakUps,fg1551n,t1_fg0muct,1580420942.0,Yeah I’m pretty sure mines a lost cause

BreakUps,ffwlpq0,t3_evj1wh,1580304899.0,I wish I wasn’t destitute so I could buy some coins and give you an award thank you for posting this
SuicideWatch,ffwlhw7,t1_ffwbrib,1580304723.0,That does not sound like a good time I want it to be peaceful...I think the options are limited. I’m giving today another shot. At a living I mean. It’s all over a stupid guy that’s driving me crazy. Not all but mostly. Head games. But also I don’t want to be alone

DeadBedrooms,ffqri1d,t1_ffqlbqx,1580141962.0,50F . Thinking every other day would be the best but I’m down for every day.
SuicideWatch,ffqosum,t3_euo34a,1580140130.0,You were a five year old child who stumbled. Little kids fall all over the place. It’s what they do. It’s just bad luck. This was just a really bad one. You didn’t do it purposely. If anybody was negligent it sounds like it was your parents. In any case they are toxic to do such a terrible thing to you. There’s definitely them blaming you and not you blaming you? Forgive yourself and forgive them for being shitty parents And then figure out how to get away from them can you go away to college or something?

BreakUps,ffp6bcc,t3_euby3s,1580087329.0,My fiancé died a few days before April fools day. I swear I was at the wake before I believed it was real. I’m not even sure I believed it was real at the wake. It was so surreal. I think it was some kind of  shock  reaction
KindVoice,ffjmsuc,t3_ettto9,1580001871.0,I had a therapist that hugged me and he turned out to be less than ethical.  (Times a million) sorry it made you feel bad but be glad at least she’s ethical.

DeadBedrooms,ffjd96k,t3_ett4rl,1579995841.0,"I am out one of those people that just tell people that they should dump their partner lightly. I know so many people are just like for every trans gression they’re  just like “You don’t need that shit, dump her”.....But this is abuse. Seriously. She’s going to try and turn this around on you and say that you alienated her.  watch. Do not trust this one get a good fucking lawyer.
So toxic. She doesn’t want sex and puts it on you? Run..."

BreakUps,ffig8kw,t1_ffifaz0,1579973137.0,"I always wondered why people couldn’t see things. I thought there was always a clue, now I’m not sure. I guess there were clues. But gee jumping on every little clue Can make a person crazy.  Do we really want to spend forever analyzing everything to death? I don’t know.  Maybe we do or we wouldn’t be on here. What a mess the humans are. Typing this has made me realize I am not ready to jump into another relationship....."

lonely,ffga6rn,t3_etc8ib,1579901784.0,"I never really thought about it until I was out eating by myself (sometimes I like to just go to a restaurant and bring a book). And the hostess said just you and I was like yeah and she made a weird ass shocked face. I don’t really get what the big deal is but , yes, sometimes people have an opinion about it I guess.  but that’s their problem. I’m not going to stay home because of them. they’re  nobody to me."
DeadBedrooms,ffg27ql,t3_etcjed,1579896866.0,"Before we go off kid hating,  negging women, etc. 

I had had two kids , loved them and still had sex.  you say you wouldn’t mind another kid. You just don’t want her drive to disappear. 
So. Why does she lose her drive? Is she tired? Get her help. Is it hormonal? See the gyno. Doesn’t have to be one or the other. You can totally have sex and have children."
Prosopagnosia,ffez901,t3_essi9w,1579871134.0,I thought the tattoo it could be fake.  Weird how the face tattoo didn’t help me all that much But the beard did. I have no idea why ppl post these.
