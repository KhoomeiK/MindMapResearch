He has to make you feel comfortable and pretty and sure about yourself and how you look. To make you feel wanted.The way that he was watching this girl. His gaze has no 'work' with this girl. He should gaze at you. Dump him and be happy.
 My ex was the same, he did always find something that was off about my appearance. I dumped his ass. Now my SO finds everything about me beautiful and he constantly shows it and says it."

She learned a new word, doesn't seem to fully understand the meaning but it sounds good, so she identifies herself with it. I remember, a couple years ago when my bestfriend was feeling kind of odd and special- she went full blown on the sex spectrum. One month she was asexual, the next pansexual, bi and so on and so on.

It doesn't look like a partnership between you two, more like a parenthood - you bring the money in the house, tidy the house and you are next to him when he plays the single role he has - to be the crybaby. Sorry babe, dreams are dreams, but they don't pay your next meal."
