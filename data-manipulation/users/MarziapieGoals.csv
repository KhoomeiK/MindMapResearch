AskReddit,ffgork6,t3_etj2de,1579911251.0,Idrk if this counts as global but the fact that 40% of homeless ppl in many first world countries are lgbt teens shows that some ppl clearly think it’s ok to kick them out for something they can’t control. Instead of that the media focuses on bullshit like why not believing in 37 genders is transfobic and that kinda shit.
AskReddit,ffgct82,t3_etcyd6,1579903386.0,Encourage more female-male relationships without the hole “they must be dating” or “one of them is gay”. I’m aware there r a lot of guys w/ female friends but in many places of the world it’s less common (I hope ppl aren’t only talking about Europe and America). I think us women need to help men with their issues and stop treating every man as evil or deserving of any evil they have to go through. I know that women tend to be more understanding or nurturing and some men need that in their life. This can even help both men and women.

I disliked them after only a few days, and did I forget to mention she would make a scene anywhere anytime? Still I had no friends cuz I don’t tend to talk to ppl (I enjoy being alone quite a bit but it doesn’t mean I wouldn’t like friends), and didn’t deal with her until the next year when I made a bunch of friends that were supporting me and saying I should tell her off.

Why are people annoyed at these facts? Yeah there is really shitty pet food in many places that you shouldn’t give ur pets, but cooking gourmet meal for them isn’t good. They can get over weight really easily that way, and it also wastes money that could be used for better things.

What my mom used to do was buy raw chicken liver, cut it up, and mix it with normal dry food. 

Now she buys dry food and mixes it with those meet dog food cans.
