hondapilot,fdse10p,t1_fds4l72,1578700527.0,"It went back to the shop today, VSA, ! light, and check engine light along with the Pilot shaking madly while pressing the gas. Back to Lyft for getting around. Thanks for the help with my piece of shit car."
hondapilot,fdomvyc,t1_fdiaw2q,1578608390.0,"Got the Pilot back from yesterday's problem. The end result, the oil switch was bad and apparently 2 of the 6 coils were cracked. They replaced all 6 and all is aparently fine. 

No mention of a problem with coolant/antifreeze in my oil or head gasket etc.

One question though. A few moments after I left the lot, the VSA indicator light (! within a triangle) came on followed by the VSA lit letters. 

Is there any easy way to reset / get rid of those? One mechanic solved it on my Pilot a while back all while sitting in the drivers seat. But not quite sure what he did.

Thanks"
hondapilot,fdm0a28,t1_fdiaw2q,1578536750.0,"The Pilot errored out again today, oil and coolant very low. Had it towed to a local recommended shop for diag. Hopefully soon I'll find out what the damage is. 

I'll update with details when I know. I also joined the Facebook group, just for good info at least."
hondapilot,fdgk37j,t1_fdfwx0x,1578399938.0,"The one main question I have is where does the oil disappear to? There are no leaks, I never see puddles of anything under my car (I always look as I walk up to before I leave)."
hondapilot,fdgjpcq,t1_fdfwx0x,1578399534.0,Thanks for the information. It's a 2wd.

getdisciplined,fcoaiut,t3_ei3vwd,1577827515.0,"Great information, thank you for sharing. Personally, I've never done resolutions. Goals and habits are the way to go. Don't take on too much, pick 1 or 2 goals / habits and master those. Then rinse and repeat. :)"
smallbusiness,fciy16p,t3_ehdlzm,1577672545.0,Sounds like a great idea. My 2020 start is continuing the project of rebuilding my small IT business (in hopes to grow it a little bit more).
WholeFoodsPlantBased,fcg7t8q,t3_eh45g4,1577637315.0,"When I first started into the WFPB lifestyle, I had a lot of problems with this. But as I learned to listen to my body I figured out that too much fiber (for me) had me running to the bathroom.  And certain foods that are higher in fiber than others were always a bad experience for me.

That was a few years ago now and I've adjusted what foods I eat or how I prepare certain foods before cooking to solve the issues. 

For example, if you are eating beans or lentils on a regular basis, which I do, try sprouting them before you cook them. Simple soak them for a few hours, then drain and let sit in a collander for at least 24 hours until most are sprouting (I use a stainless steel collander). Then I cook. It really helps with the gas issue and apparently boosts the nutritional value.

Another example, I learned (through painful trial and error) that Apples were bad for me. So I no longer eat them on a regular basis. Once in a while I will."
Delaware,fcg5jdz,t1_fcf8f0t,1577636676.0,Thanks. Looks interesting. Will have to check it out.
getdisciplined,fc9zj7o,t1_fc9fkim,1577560550.0,I tried looking for that and couldn't find them on Discord.
