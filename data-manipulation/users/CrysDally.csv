WeightLossAdvice,fdsgt0r,t1_fds98b9,1578702448.0,"Start small, and think of the here and now. If you look too far ahead you will tend to become overwhelmed and then you will over eat. Make small goals and slowly increase them as you get better. Walk half an hour, cut out soda, eat 5 veggies a day, (something like that) once that becomes habit, increase those goals.
 Seriously if you are only looking at the end goal you will always be overwhelmed and give up easily. Take it one day at a time.
 Keep track of everything you eat and how much exercise you are getting. Try a food logging app, you will see how many cals you eat and then you can make adjustments."
WeightLossAdvice,fds8wse,t3_emvr1u,1578697033.0,"Walk, walk, walk. Walking will lift your spirits and build leg muscles and bones. Walk until you sweat and breath heavy. Wear a fitbit and keep increasing your goal steps every couple of weeks. Once you start walking every day, you will feel better/less lazy, then you will want to change your eating habits. Try intermittent fasting after the exercise becomes habit."
