It was only just a couple weeks ago the US assassinated a General of a country with which we shared a tactical goal in Syria, while he was inside an allied country. An action that violated treaties and contravened international law. And why? To score short-term political points at home. 

Iran might be playing games in the Middle East that are against our interests but don’t for a fucking second talk as if they’re beneath us in morality. Despite the cover up at least Iran made an apology. Bush Sr refused to make any such apology after we shot down an Iranian airliner. “I will never apologize for America.” American exceptionalism is disgusting and blinds our foreign policy from the straight and honest path."

If it’s you, don’t talk to the cops, even if you’re repentant.

If it’s a crime committed by someone in the community that you consider bad then bleed your heart out HOWEVER, do so WITH A LAWYER because the cops and prosecutors may want to envelop you the you with the crime.
