Attempting to segment every single VM to it's own network is certainly an option, but it's an overly complicated one as you're finding out. It also sounds like you are missing some fundamental understanding of how networking works, which is going to make this process way more difficult for everyone involved, and means you are likely to make mistakes.

While trying to achieve security is obviously a good thing, you are probably going to end up with a bunch of holes while expending a ton of effort with the way you are currently going.

I'd recommend having one VLAN for your DMZ machines to segment them from the rest of your network. I'd also recommend you study or review some fundamentals of how subnets, routes, and basic network communication works, because of your questions like the following:

>*Is this because the machines are on the same subnet and are trying to find the other vms using broadcast rather than routing via default gateway?*

Routing is for communication between subnets, so when devices are on the same subnet, they won't need the default gateway at all. This is where the netmask comes in, it's a way to tell machines what other IP's will be on their network.

Is this for a business or home setup? And what Hypervisor are you using?"

I passed SysOps at the beginning of December, so my experience with it is relatively recent.

If you have failed this exam 4 times, I suspect there are larger issues at play than your in depth knowledge of the material, given that you have passed SA and Dev. I took SysOps the same week I took Dev, and the only thing I used for SysOps to supplement my knowledge was the Bonso exams. The stuff I had learned from SA and Dev were largely applicable and sufficient.

I'm really not sure how you would go about this, but I think it'd be beneficial for you to work on your test taking skills in general. If you're running out of time, you're probably taking way too much time thinking about the questions. I'd work on going through some practice tests, even if it's for a different cert, and work on quickly reading the question and picking and answer before moving on. Often people's first guess is more likely to be correct than if you change it. If you sit there pondering about a question, and can't come up with a convincing reason why another answer is right, stick with your first guess. If you have a practice exam that you haven't memorized the answers for, try and complete it in \~45 minutes or less.

I don't know that I would go through the Pro courses, there is going to be a ton of information in there, and given your situation I don't think it'll help you retain the parts you're missing.

freenas,fdij1ju,t1_fdii2k3,1578444016.0,"Okay, got it. Changes things.

If you're trying to maximize available storage, for the cost, I'd probably do one large RAIDZ2 pool. Your reads should still be really high, you can tolerate 2 losses, and have pretty good write speeds.

If you need higher write speeds, I'd probably look at striping across two RAIDZ1 vdevs. Better write speed(roughly 2x), basically same read as above. **NOTE:** I'd backup any important data that you cannot reproduce somewhere else. You stand a good chance of having a bit error during a rebuild of a 10TB drive.

Also, I recommend you get an SSD for a read cache, and an SSD for a write cache. The write SSD doesn't need a lot of space, but larger SSD's perform better than the very small ones. The last device I got from TrueNAS had a 200GB SSD for the write cache, but only used a 10GB partition due to the way writes flush and all that jazz. For home I'd probably just get a 64 GB and call it a day for the write cache.

For read cache I'd probably do 512 GB or 1 TB.

If you need better redundancy, start looking at 50, 60, a large RAIDZ2 pool, etc. Make sure you look at the probability of errors with your drives, which is why things like RAID5 isn't recommended much anymore for large drive sizes.
