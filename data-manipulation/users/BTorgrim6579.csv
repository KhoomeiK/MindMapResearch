saltierthancrait,fe67m7x,t3_enu8z7,1578883589.0,"solo: am i a joke to you?

rogue one was really good, but the characters were so flat and the story was a little bit much. i didnít really like the opening scenes, but that last part is fucking godly. rogue one should have just been an hour long short on disney plus thatís just the battle of scarif in detail. 

solo was a fun action adventure movie that really feels like a star wars movie. thereís only one plot line, and if you donít like characters, which happens a lot, theyíre usually gone quickly. the only characters who stick around are Han and Chewie, who is a real character in this film. whenís the last time you saw chewie have a goddamn conversation? please see cosmonaut variety hours review of solo for more detail. only thing i didnít like was how han got his name

force awakens was fun and set up plot points that didnít go anywhere in later movies. i liked it, but it was so similar to anh that it felt boring. like oh my god they got another death star what do we do

the last jedi was ratshit. i donít think i really need to explain myself. only good part was snokes throne room scene, but the shit on canto bite makes it not worth it.

The ros is not great. it felt lazy, and like they were trying to copy endgame.

overall, i think that solo is the best disney star wars film, but if rogue one didnít have all that first and middle act shit then rogue one would be the best"
