cyberpunkgame,fgybzpr,t1_fgxkygl,1581181696.0,Yeah any game with writing as fantastic and engaging as TW3 would be amazing. Cyberpunk is so rife with potential as well. CDPR's love of twisted moral dilemmas can be explored at length in this new setting.
cyberpunkgame,fgybb4c,t1_fgwwako,1581181474.0,"The thing is, some people seem to be expecting a game even more in depth and immersive than Witcher 3. Which I don't think is really going to happen. That game while amazing does have some fairly prominent flaws. 

I'm definitely on the same level as you guys where The Witcher 3 quality would be amazing and contending for my favourite game ever (because Cyberpunk is my fave genre)."

formula1,fgwylrf,t1_fgvj159,1581167331.0,I was thinking just today how Ron Dennis seems so much like a supervillain. His obsession with image is really interesting and was what inadvertently made me fall in love with McLaren (aesthetically they've always been on-point).

Then if you test positive, you can get financial compensation for staying at home. Drop off supplies and then seal the doors, and they get the compensation at the end when the doors are proven still sealed. 

It's throwing money at the problem, but should work somewhat."
China_Flu,fgwdhar,t3_f0naj2,1581159847.0,It makes sense. Especially with all the videos of people dying in the streets.

formula1,fgvux8p,t1_fgvuf5l,1581153357.0,That's so incredibly dumb and actually kind of said. It sounds like CART was essentially becoming a competitor for F1. Such petty reasons to want to diverge.

The thing about Channel 4 not randomly selecting episodes makes no sense when even if they did that, you'd be gatekeeping and telling people off for not watching it in that order. Given the nature of the TV show, it's much more likely the episode release was determined by production needs. Especially with their penchant for hiring well known talent - that means they were likely pretty limited in terms of scheduling production."

Why? It's an anthology series. The order literally does not matter at all.

Episode 1 being skipped isn't really about what people can handle. It's that it doesn't really introduce people to what the actual theme of the episode is. Also this will probably get downvoted, but it's just not that good of an episode."
