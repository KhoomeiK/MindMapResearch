unpopularopinion,ff7n325,t3_erx2x0,1579653490.0,"Okay so there’s some definite truth to the parroting problem but it’s a little more nuanced that that. Not to dunk on any one particular group but, there are a *ton* of people from every walk of life who simply aren’t intelligent enough to fully grasp the world beyond themselves and their small world-bubble. Can we agree on that?

Those people will always latch onto whatever social normality that will gain them the most socio-economic leverage in their world-bubble. If you live in a majority Christian community, you’re highly likely to be a Christian. SLC, Utah is a perfect example of this. 

If we are using specifically Reddit as the focus group here, there are a couple points to note.  Reddit is vast, vast majority English speaking users from countries where either Catholics or Protestants thrived. 

It’s not that people are afraid to dunk on other religions, it’s the fact that - hello - you’re not the only one who experiences strife around their religious beliefs. Whether in offense or defense of. Most of our point of reference is western Christianity so, of course, it’s the thing we can dunk on the best.

In summary, it’s not that we don’t want to dunk on these dumb fuck dick licking Buddhists and Muslims and Hari Krishnas and fucking Witches and any of the other ones I might be leaving out - it’s not that we don’t want to clown your stupid ceremonial robes and whatever that stuff is you’re yelling into megaphones all the times, we just don’t know about your shit that well."

AskReddit,feijgsx,t1_fei6nzg,1579139945.0,"That’s not a valid comparison. The two choices aren’t ‘work at a cigarette factory’  or ‘make $80k/year at a charity’. Factory work is almost always unskilled labor (of which I’ve done my fair share). We aren’t talking about rare or irreplaceable jobs. 

At some level, there is a personal responsibility to mankind that has to supersede your desire to make $12.50 vs $11. 

And like any circumstance where I’m “shitting” on someone, there is a level of empathy here. I’ve been poor as John the Baptist.

We used 'horsepower' because, at the time, that was what we had used to pull things. Once engines were invented, to give people an idea of how many horses their new tractor could replace. You had 6 horses to pull your plow before? Our new tractor is 20 horsepower. Thats the basic idea."
nextfuckinglevel,fdz5yip,t3_en7222,1578787057.0,"“Oh my god...Di....Diego?” Sweetest tears, a mouse’s tear, begins to well in her aged eyes. His name is choked by a little sob because she didn’t even remember until *right now* just how much she has craved him in his absence. A hollow pit in her soul has begun to fill with some sort of holy water, for the healing it brings. Faster than even her tears can flow, her heart overflows because *it is him*! She screams with joy and ambles toward his all-too-familiar shape (*But bigger! My but he was enormous!*), her shell clunking so wonderfully against his as she rubbed her ear against his, their blood like a waterfall. 

“Maria.” Diego is laughing through his tears and they are both laughing together now, a half-twist of the neck and they’re staring into each other’s eyes. 

“Diego it’s been almost sixty years! My god!” She can barely speak but she must understand how this is happening. Is this a dream? *Fifty-eight years since he was taken from me! From our village!* “Please Diego, please tell me how is this possible? Are you okay? Are you real? Are you really back? Where have you been all this time?!” 

Diego had considered this very moment for the last fifty-eight years. *How the devil am I gonna explain to Maria that I have, literally, fucked and impregnated...Christ, I lost count. I can’t believe I lost count for fucks sake! Is this what I have become? Some...fuck machine for this weird alien culture that seemed to have some manic need for me to be fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, constantly, constantly day and night for the last five decades? I don’t like this me. I don’t know if I can ever come back from here. God help me.*

I tried to make it clear that, when I say they are out of the loop, I mean they are not aware of what facefucking is at 10 years old. They're kids.  

That being said, I think it's a tad alarmist to claim that 10 years old is some kind of threshold for technological proficiency. I remember my dad getting our first PC when he was like 45 in 1998 and he's fantastic with computers now.

AdviceAnimals,fds6cq8,t1_fds0d30,1578695359.0,"Your entire point hinges on your parenthetical ‘things are getting better’. For who? Says who? Does history not teach us to be vigilant? Our entire civilization is predicated on the rich taking advantage of the poor! Every major societal boom has flourished by crushing the lowest class (the USA and slavery being the most recent example). 

Nothing of what I’ve said is remotely far fetched. Not only that, we can literally look back at history and see the same type of predatory behavior between rich/poor play out over and over again ad nauseum.

offmychest,fds59hg,t1_fdpyyde,1578694655.0,"We homeschool our kids. Both of us went to public school and did fine. We aren’t religious. My wife was an early education major and a teacher and, financially, it’s almost broken us but we’ve chosen to continue on with this. 

Why? Because my kids are intelligent and we don’t give them iPhones to play with. Relatively speaking, they’re out of the loop. They play outside all the time even though it’s a tiny backyard in a packed-together neighborhood. They learn at their own pace in a way that works for them. We have a curriculum. We hit benchmarks. 

Are my kids sheltered? Of course. A byproduct of homeschooling. That being said, we watch R rated movies. We let the kids swear as long as it’s never done maliciously. We talk candidly to them like little adults, more or less. It’s a fun family. I REALLY LIKE my kids. I like how they are and how I’m raising them to be. I see how jaded and *savvy* kids are these days - watching porn at like 7 and 8? Happens all the time. Kid leans over and shoves a phone in your kid’s face with a video of some cartel guy getting his head chainsawed off. That’s a brand new fold on your kid’s brain. 

Or your 11 year old daughter being told by the 11 year old boy she likes that she needs to suck his little dick if she really likes him. And don’t worry, we won’t have to lose our virginity because we can just buttfuck! This is honestly how it’s going in middle schools right now. We live in a huge suburban area that’s very gun-heavy - now we have to think about school shootings too? Fuck me. Combine that with all the extra shit you need to do for public school (wake your kids up too early, etc) It just doesn’t seem worth it. 

For those who love the public school system - fantastic. Depending on where you live and the type of child you have, it can be a great experience."
