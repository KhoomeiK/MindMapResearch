Otherwise I'd recommend Grant. The rooms are a bit nicer, however if you want a suite with a living room you'll need to go Stevenson"
college,ff75m01,t3_ertqju,1579641585.0,Talk to your RA if you have one. They'll be able to direct you to your school's resources for clubs and possibly setup a program to help residents within your building meet each other
NIU,feshds3,t3_ep42df,1579365141.0,I'm a foodie so I'm gonna reccomend Jamrah and Egg Haven. You get a lot of food for about $10 and they're really good for allergies (I have a gluten allergy personally)

college,fehb1kv,t3_ep5rlo,1579112867.0,"Call the scholarship office again or go to them. Ask them who exactly you should call. They are the people that should be able to point you in the right direction and ""Call another office"" is incredibly unhelpful

Try talking to the financial office (non-fin aid) if the scholarship office is of no help

If both don't help contact your campus ombudsman (or ombudsberson). They'll get the ball rolling on finding someone to help you as both should have resources they can give you"

college,fegpvln,t3_ep1or8,1579099717.0,"See if your school has an online menu. This might help you look into your best choices for healthier foods (or at least what to avoid)

I personally ate burgers and mozzarella sticks everyday for my first 2 weeks because I was so excited to eat something like that without having to pay cash for it

Just a bit of self control and remember that some foods were not made with a 2000 calorie diet in mind"
college,fegpjjy,t3_ep2w8y,1579099488.0,I would reccomend talking to an academic advisor at your university or someone within the department. They will be able to give you the best answer as they will know what employers will think of that specific degree from that specific college
NIU,fegpag4,t3_eobmpg,1579099311.0,"Hi! I'd highly reccomend checking out the [tutoring centers](https://www.niu.edu/access/tutors/index.shtml) at Founders Memorial Library as well as New Hall. They'll be opening up on the 21st and can hopefully help you out there!

In the meantime try meeting people within the Engineering Building (or whichever building these classes are in) as you may find someone who's already taken the class!"
NIU,fegozax,t3_eou1bv,1579099094.0,"Hi! Noah the CA here

So you'll want to check out [Military and Post-Traditional Student Services](https://www.niu.edu/mptss/index.shtml). You can find them on the first floor of the Campus Life Building (kinda by NIU PD)

I'd also reccomend looking into Northern View. I am a little biased since I live here, but I've found a lot of post-traditional students enjoy the added privacy it brings, plus you get a kitchen where you can really cook

If you have any other questions feel free to reply to this comment or PM me!"
college,fafm8gv,t3_e8zmjl,1576026303.0,"I'm going to speak to the marijuana aspect of this situation and only that: Smoking on campus can get you into major trouble depending on the university. Some are lax and will give you a slap on the wrist for the first time, but almost always it'll lead to serious punishment after a certain number of write ups

I'm an RA and I've had to deal with smoking (both marijuana and cigarettes) on campus. People think they're sneaky because they blow it through a tube or out a window, yet we still catch them. It's just not worth the risk"
