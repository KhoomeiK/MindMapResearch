>Absolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing and shelter.[2] The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is always about the same, independent of the person's permanent location or era.
>
>On the other hand, relative poverty occurs when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. Therefore, the threshold at which relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.[3] For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe).

>Yes, Trans Women Can Get Period **Symptoms**
>
>There’s one thing cis and transgender people agree on—**trans women and transfeminine people don’t get periods**.
>
>Those of us who were assigned male at birth (AMAB) generally came out of the womb without ovaries or a reproductive system that can support a pregnancy, so we don’t bleed every month in preparation for one. It’s generally seen as one of the net positives about being a transgender woman as opposed to a cisgender gal; before and after I started transitioning, my cis girlfriends came to me with their tales of woe —** bloating, cramps, violent mood swings, nausea **— all sometimes too intense for them to reasonably get out of bed. “You’re so lucky,” they’d moan, and I would shrug sheepishly, implicitly agreeing that I was fortunate to never share in those experiences. That would be impossible. Right?
>
>Imagine my shock, then, when I talked with my friend Ashley last month, just before she went into the hospital for a few weeks. Nervous about the length of time she would have to stay, she told me the reason for her reticence: “I’m due for my period in a couple days, and that’s going to really suck.”
>
>Uh, what?
>
>Ashley’s a 23-year-old trans girl who’s been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for over a year. She takes a cocktail of the antiandrogen spironolactone and estradiol, a form of estrogen. About five months into her treatment, she began experiencing a predictable pattern of symptoms: **First would come the soreness and swelling in her chest along with bouts of nausea; the next day, she’d endure painful abdominal cramping lasting minutes at a time, as well as constant nausea, hot flashes, dizziness, photosensitive migraines, and bloating. This cycle, she says, lasts for about six to seven days and repeats roughly every five weeks.**

>It was a battle for Jaden Fields to even get the appointment. When he, a trans man, tried to make arrangements with a gynecologist’s office, he was met with disrespect and disbelief. So much so that his primary care provider had to make the appointment for him. When he arrived at the office, he was dismissed, misgendered by the staff and eventually had the police called on him. 
>
>Fields, who described his experiences for Hello Beautiful, is far from the only transgender person to have a problem finding respect and affirmation from the health care establishment.
>
>“Engaging with the medical system as a trans person is always a scary proposition,” Katelyn Burns, a trans woman, freelance writer and Vox contributor, told HuffPost. “The health care system’s lack of general competence with trans people absolutely is a deterrent for all trans people to go to the doctor, but when we do find good medical providers, we tend to stick with them.”
>
>Burns encountered this general lack of competence after seeking treatment for minor post-surgery complications. The gynecologist she was referred to was inexperienced in dealing with her issues and offered few solutions. After this, she decided it was time to find a new doctor. Her search ended when a trusted friend recommended one in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Here, she was treated with respect by a physician who was “worth every penny” despite being out of network.

So basically I already addressed this in my comment by mentioning why a trans person would want to see an OBGYN, but it's not like you actually read things before using them as a source. Talk about an own goal, dickhead."
