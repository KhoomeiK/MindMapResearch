ProgrammerHumor,ff34bxn,t1_ff32nce,1579533341.0,"Damn that sucks... I studied for 3 years then realized the professors in school were morons, got offered some contract work because someone liked some free coding I did for them. The guy with a masters got dropped 3 months after I started because the VP was like ... dafuq? Took me 3 months to get farther building SPA web app than this dill hole with a masters and he had been working on one for 1 year. Yeah my wage was shit for the first 2 years but since then I been getting 30-50% increases."
ProgrammerHumor,ff32goz,t1_ff2onsl,1579531940.0,"Degrees don’t mean shit. I replaced a guy with a masters degree, and I don’t have a degree. I’m self taught since I was 10. The guy sucked, wrote messy code, had no idea how to grow/learn, and was 3-4 times slower at coding than me. Degrees just give “developers” false sense of skill because they had professors hold their hands for 4-8 years. All the greatest coders I know are self-taught and studied other subjects in school like math, petrol engineering, and many even dropped out."

trashy,ff2ppr2,t3_er1w0l,1579518257.0,"This is just pathetic, at a certain point we have to realize that a lot of cops are shitty people dressed in blue, who wanted a profession where they could be extra shitty to “shitty” people and have tons of job security and benefits while doing it. At this point it’s a cultural issue within police forces around our country."
