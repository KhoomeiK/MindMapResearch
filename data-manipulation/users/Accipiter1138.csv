Games,ffinvrb,t1_ffgzsu5,1579978375.0,"We'll see how well it's actually implemented, but I think there can be a bit of a turnoff with lowered aggression since it can make the fight look less cool even if you know you aren't playing that well.

I played Fallen Order recently, and discovered that I'm terrible at it. Truly, utterly terrible for the same reasons I never played Souls games. I fought the first miniboss, Oggdo Bogdo, and eventually got frustrated and lowered the difficulty. To my surprise, though, I actually felt bad about it since he just...sat there and let me hit him.

I was hoping for a bit of a crutch, but it ended up feeling anticlimactic instead. Anyway, I suppose the challenge with difficulty levels seems like one of allowing all skill levels to feel like they just had a great experience even if they know they didn't perform all that well. If the enemies aren't swinging at them then that could break that experience. 

If aggression isn't carefully implemented then it could make for a boring game rather than an easy one. It's a fine line to walk so I'm curious to see how it works out for this game."

Back in WW1 in the UK, you had a group of men in the government recruitment office that came up with some really disgusting ways of trying to boost recruitment numbers.

Then, you had a group of women who actually carried the plan out and went around handing white feathers to military-age men and shaming them for not protecting the country. Some men couldn't handle this societal pressure so they went out and joined and died in a stupid war.

Unfortunately?

A good pair of pliers. Pull them out quickly, and at the same angle they went in. 

Though if it's, say, a serious case as often is with dogs, go to a vet. Quills frequently end up in sensitive places, and it's good to have extra people to hold the dog down."

The fuck."

A brewery close to me had a new neighborhood built around it and a few residents were going ballistic over ""smoke"" and ""toxic smells."" Of course, it was just steam from the brewhouse and the smell of boiling wort, which imo smells pretty good."

It's possible, but they're often instinctually uncomfortable with it. Those guard hairs - the very outermost hair on their body that covers the quills - are very sensitive and are a signal for the porcupine to raise it's quills in a defensive manner.

A bit like rubbing a cat the wrong way."

Porcupine quills aren't hollow, they're spongy. What causes the microscopic barbs on quills to flare is moisture, so cutting them does nothing but shorten the quill.

Making the quill shorter is dangerous - cutting the shaft off simply gives you less to grip, and in some cases causes whoever is removing them to miss what's left of the quill. Because the quills are barbed, the very action of skin and  muscle causes them to be pulled in further as the victim moves. Broken or cut quills might sometimes be missed and the head of the quill will make its way under the skin where it might puncture something important or get lodged up against bone.
