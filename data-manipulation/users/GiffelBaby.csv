LivestreamFail,ffjehm5,t1_ffjd3hc,1579996559.0,"> Faster

Sure, gas cars have higher top speed. For now...

>  better looking

This is subjective. IMO Tesla's are very nice looking. Sure, many EV's from legacy automakers are really ugly. But this isn't an issue with EV's, its the automakers that make horrible designs.

> sounding

Dude, what? Why is sound a good thing? I dont get it. 

> takes minutes to gas up

Whats your point here? When i leave my home every morning, my EV is already fully charged because i plugged it in over night.

> you can work on them to make them faster

Very few people actually does this. And sure, you can keep your horse and shovel its shit and buy new horse shoes for it if you want.

> Teslas are soccer mom cars 

TIL: Ben Affleck, Will Smith, Morgan Freeman and Leonardo DiCaprio are soccer moms."

Let's say you are on a road trip in your Model 3 Standard Range Plus (250mi range) and are driving 60 mph the whole way. You could drive 4 hours without having to charge it.

I dont know about you, but after 4 hours of driving i need a bathroom break and stretch my legs or get some snacks. This is when you charge your car. Its really not a big deal."

Please dont get scared away from playing it because of the visual styling of the game, it honestly enhances the experience and you are gonna realize that pretty quickly.

Don't get me wrong. This is not a game for everyone. You are playing as an insurance investigator and a merchant ship called Obra Dinn was declared lost at sea, but has drifted into port with damaged sails and no visible crew. It's now your job to figure out what happened on the ship only using a ""magic pocket watch"" and a book with a map and a list of names and some pictures of the crew."
