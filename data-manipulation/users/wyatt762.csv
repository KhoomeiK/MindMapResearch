LifeProTips,felp7g7,t1_felngow,1579227574.0,Because our work structure is alien to most of the planet as well. If you work 12 hours a day and sleep 7 that leave 5 hours for eating and living. Why spend that precious time making food when you cak pickup food on your commute. When I was in the army I caught myself eating McDonalds every morning for breakfast. I was following my macros but it was still like 5 dollars every day.
forza,fefo0z3,t1_fefnwoy,1579060550.0,5.7 is a 350 small block. I'm downloading horizon right now coincidentally so I'll check the swaps. There used to be a 5.7 and a 6.2 I think.

MapPorn,fdx0kr5,t1_fdwyjk1,1578764116.0,Yeah exactly. This is only thinking about sea levels. Borth pole melting is still very very bad. We've seen polar bears coming inland a lot earlier than normal and they go back to sea quite a bit later.
MapPorn,fdwy4yb,t1_fdwa74n,1578763415.0,North pole doesnt matter if it all melts because there is basically 0 land mass. So it's all ice floating on the sea. So the buoyant force is already there. Doesnt matter if it is frozen or not.

My point is that it takes very little time to become proficient at a labour skill compared to most ""tech"" jobs. Just look at the schooling to be an electrician vs being an electrical engineer. Do you think an electrical engineer could be an electrician? Of course, most of them are. But are most electricians electrical engineers? For the majority no."
unpopularopinion,fcpgw9s,t1_fcpgsbc,1577863497.0,"Yeah absolutely including wind chill. Ambient temperature doesnt matter as far as danger goes. -40 and 40mph winds is equally as dangerous if not more dangerous than -82 ambient.

The islands dont shut down at -40 but all outdoor work does stop for the oil company I sleep at. I think I'm talking to a lot of lower 48 oil guys and shits just different in the arctic. Everyone i know up here is cool, just the idea that they all think they're better than college educated people gets so fucking old, so fast, so long ago.

I don't know what oil fields you've been to but the people that I see 26 weeks a year are not exactly the cream of the crop that everyone talks about.

It was -82f the other day and I spent most of it outside cleaning off radiometers, wrenching on a capstone turbine that failed due to low temps, and cat heater generator to keep our lab above freezing temps because of water based atmospheric particle counters.

Theres fat, old, shredded, short, tall, and every other variation of person that rotates as a roustabout and the ones that arent completely braindead can get promoted to operator.

unpopularopinion,fcp0h9h,t1_fcorjao,1577846722.0,Nah I'm a nerd that works in the oil field and moderately trained monkeys could be roustabouts. Its genuinely insane the type of people that can work up here. I would take an ex-sys admin or front end developer in a cat 966 every day over some of these guys. The only part about the oil field up here is it's cold and long hours.
