wholesomememes,fex2wv6,t3_eqr2n2,1579423424.0,The library I work at had some frog spawn in the garden last year. I loved it! It was so exciting getting to see them go from spawn to tadpoles to getting legs and to crawling out of the pond! It was like watching evolution in real life! I also gave talks to children when they visited the library :)

NoStupidQuestions,fdy9dmm,t1_fdvr78h,1578777397.0,"Yup. My mum was and is scared of the dentist and she passed it on to me. I didn't go for 10 years because I was so scared. Eventually it got to a point where I decided I wasn't going to pass my fear on to my son so I started going again. I needed 12 fillings but managed to get through it over the course of a few months. My son has been to the dentist a few times now for check ups and he loves going. Although he's only 2 and a half, last time we went, he sat in the chair alone and let the dentist use the small tools (mirror and pointy thing).

One of the best things I've done is to get over my fear of the dentist. It wasn't easy but I know I've helped my son to not be afraid so it was worth it."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fduibas,t1_fduer8k,1578733460.0,A good way to deal with stuff like this is to ask the child what they think it is. Same with the inevitable where do babies come from. Find out what they know so far and then give them as much information as you deem age appropriate.

insanepeoplefacebook,fdl34ra,t1_fdks1a0,1578516248.0,£60? Where did you find it for that price? We were going to get my son vaccinated but everywhere was around £100-120 for the 2 doses needed.
