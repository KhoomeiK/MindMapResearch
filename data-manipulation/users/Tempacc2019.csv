explainlikeimfive,ff8ccgb,t1_ff8b35w,1579672741.0,">I presume we don't understand the underlying mechanism behind why these small, random things resolve into something predictable? 

We do. It is because this randomness is highly localized. That a given electron (belonging to one specific hydrogen atom we happen to be observing) can have any position in the entire observable universe is a true statement. But within the region of about a few femtometers from the nucleus of an atom, the electron's existence is 99.99999% probable whereas the probability of its existence at alpha centauri (our closest star) will be of the order of 10^-30 or something (all numbers are made up in this example but they illustrate the point). 

So because the randomness is contained tightly enough, when you combine lots and lots of them together, they generally stay within their own area of randomness and interact as one predictable blob with each other. This creates a macroscopic system which starts following simpler and simpler laws.

Now technically, we have advanced enough as a species that things we're building in electronics are starting to test these limits. We made things smaller and smaller until we started hitting levels at which these randomness blobs started exhibiting their weird behaviour. We're currently trying to master this behaviour and bend it to work for us rather than against us but we're still a ways off. 

>So you're essentially saying that what we interact with everyday is a whole bunch of randomisation coming together to make something non-random?

Yes. Succinctly put and essentially correct.

explainlikeimfive,ff89xuh,t1_ff7oh8f,1579670389.0,"For a layman there is a simpler understanding of quantum physics that you don't need a high degree of education to grasp. As you dig deeper and deeper into the smallest recesses of your world, reality stops being a defined region with boundaries. It starts becoming what you can only imagine as a cloud of nebulousness. Were you to prod this cloud with something to study it, it briefly becomes a solid point but it otherwise exists as a cloud.

As you zoom out of these small dimensions, these small clouds which individually behave in a random manner start interacting with each other and get bound together in ways that make them behave very predictably even though they're still small clouds of randomness individually. These become elements, then molecules, compounds, mixtures and finally objects as you keep zooming out further and further. At each level, you care lesser and lesser about this randomness until you can say ""I threw this ball at 50 mph, how long will it take to travel 100 miles?"" and not consider how the ball's electrons  will interact with electrons of air molecules.

Which seems absurd to us now, but it was valid debate as the physicists were trying to figure this out.

explainlikeimfive,ff6rs9s,t1_ff692z3,1579633530.0,"So the explanation for that is a little bit more involved. But if you were a highly intelligent scientist in the 1920s, several experiments you did would prove that the electron did not have any specific location. One simple fact is to take the model of an electron as a layperson would know it - a small particle revolving around a nucleus. When you do the calculations, it turns out that the electron would eventually fall into the nucleus due to dissipating energy. But, as we knew it, atoms were stable whether or not you supplied energy to them.

There are several other such anomalies that the old models had. Now pair that with the fact that if you did the famous double slit experiment with an electron, it'll suddenly behave like something prescient (it'll behave like a particle if one slit is open and as a wave if both slits are open as though it knew whether the slits were open or not).

To get around this, we came up with quantum mechanics which gave us a probabilistic view of nature (instead of a deterministic view). We came up with broad rules using math that worked so well to fit what we were observing that we started making other predictions. So far, all of those predictions have turned out to be true.

>So many explainations and not one that explains how does an electron not have a specific location until we ""observe"" them. The ISS does have a specific location, so if an electron was big enough to be visible to the human eye, would we see it spin ?

So the answer to this is, ""we know it because we've done many many experiments that prove the fact"".

The second part of your question is based on confusing jargon. ""spin"" doesn't mean an actual spin. It is simply a quantum property of a particle that tells you how it interacts with magnetic fields.

So if an electron was blown up to be visible to the human eye, we have no conception of what it'd look like. As far as we know, nothing of any appreciable macro size (in the micrometer range and upwards) shows quantum properties because it all cancels out (except for a black hole, but that's a separate topic). If an electron were to be made bigger, it'd lose its quantum properties. If we magically had it retain these properties, we'd have an absolutely insane physical thing because for the first time, we'd have a macroscopic object that cannot have a definite location and velocity."

If you don't, you haven't grown up. You may argue about the net positive or negative effects of religion, but if you don't understand why the religious person believes in his religion, you still have some growing up left to do. 

>* Atheists should not be vocal about their views.

Did not say this. 

>* They don't need a community because they have nothing to talk about.

Did not say the first part, did say the second part. For the vast majority of us, atheism was a transitory phase when it defined our identity. As you grow up, it matters less to you. You don't believe in a god, end of story. 

>* Prominent atheists like Richard Dawkins are idolized by atheists like religious figures are idolized by religious people.

Correct. Maybe the degree of idolisation is lesser, but the effect is similar. Their ideas aren't groundbreaking enough for how popular they are. It's simply a question of how lowest common denominator the idea is. In a few decades, the large majority of the world is going to be atheist if current trends hold. If you were never born into a religious household, their ideas are meaningless to you. Now if you listened to Dawkins' lecture on evolution, that's different. But no one watches that. It requires expending too much brain power."

See the idea of atheism is simple - it's the absence of a God. For a few years, you obsess about it because you suddenly see everyone around you believing this nutty thing that you start thinking something is wrong with the world. Then you grow up, kinda understand where the religious people are coming from and move on once it stops affecting your life.

But that doesn't make for a good sub, does it? How can you have content if you don't keep streaming in adolescent teenagers trying to fit into the world. Once in a while, you see these stories of people from truly horrible religiously oppressed situations such as Mormons or orthodox Muslims, and you're glad to see that they've seen the light and don't consider their fellow men inferior any more. Those breaking the chains stories are always nice.

But otherwise, how do you generate enough content to keep an idea active that you naturally grow out of? By recycling old content and posting stupid shit about some extremely minor fanatic sect and their latest atrocity and using it to generalise across religions. The teenagers coming there for content are obviously just kids, so they don't question much or act like adults and research it. They just buy everything posted and come out into the world with ""all religion bad"" and masturbate to pictures of Richard Dawkins."

The gita flows from this dilemma, and a justification for the cosmic significance of dharma.

Documentaries,fcs5mwk,t1_fcpl3v6,1577911784.0,"1) No. It doesn't mean many libertarians are voting republican. It means the libertarian vote is so small that it doesn't make any difference one way or another.

2) Trump has not provided any economic results of consequence. All he's doing in bullying the federal reserve into low rates so he can show a growing economy. It's a common tactic that any govt uses, except trump infuses it with his own nasty flavour

3) Libertarians do not care about high / low taxes. If it was used efficiently, they'd be indifferent. They do try to balance between the freedom of paying lower taxes for lesser govt managed resources vs having a compulsory tax slab. Again, this is based on the belief that private enterprises are typically more efficient, moral qualms aside. An ideal libertarian world is one where the govt is competing against private enterprise, not one where there's no govt at all.

4) Military spending is part of the govt and it's a massive part of the budget. But that doesn't mean the govt isn't spending everywhere else too. Like I said, an efficient govt wouldn't have wasted a trillion dollars on the failed F35 or created so much bureaucracy that the DoD can siphon off and hide massive amounts of money without public accountability.

5) There cannot be socialist economics professors. They can lean socialist as a human doctrine but all economic systems are based on supply and demand, not a socialist or communist concept. What socialists don't understand is that the failure of socialism isn't a thing of the past. It is happening right now. The top 0.01% get to socialize their risks much more effectively now than they could in the 1960s. The very core of capitalism - a system where risky endeavours that fail are allowed to die - has been corrupted. Neoliberal thought is simply the outcome of this failure.

6) I don't support privatization in today's world. I would've in the 70s or 80s when the capitalist system was working better. But today, if you privatized welfare, it'll create such massive distortions that the concept of a safety net will become more like a fishing net that will trap anyone who falls into it for generations.

I support private and public enterprises equally. I don't think the govt should have a monopoly on anything. The American experiment in public healthcare should be a shining example of how things get corrupted when an arbitrarily powerful central authority is allowed to dictate market terms. People were scared that the govt would arm twist free enterprise into giving them the best deals. What wonderful surprise we were met with when it turned out it was easier for the private enterprises to corrupt the govt and arm twist the tax payer and consumers into feeding their bottom lines.

People think working public healthcare systems in other countries means it can be implemented in the most powerful nation on the planet. There are differences in magnitude that the public cannot fathom. It is why Warren's plan calls for $52 trillion of funding over 10 years. That is an accurate estimate in providing full coverage in such a massive nation with such a corrupted healthcare system."
Documentaries,fcphfuq,t1_fcpf55r,1577864219.0,"1) Educate yourself about what libertarianism is. Whatever you see on the street doesn't define the doctrine. If so called libertarians support republican candidates, it doesn't mean libertarianism is moving, it means they're moving away from libertarianism.

2) Libertarians support only one true god - Ron Paul. Any random jerk off teenager supporting the orange emperor for lulz on 4chan and calling himself libertarian does not mean he is one.

3) Libertarianism is not an anarchic doctrine like it is commonly believed. Opposing taxes doesn't mean they oppose govt programs. Some of them do, no doubt. But if it was funded through other means, libertarians don't care as long as it doesn't disadvantage them. What non interested people don't understand is that this is far more centrist than the commonly confused conservative stance on social programs, which views them as a societal evil holding back natural order from asserting itself. They're fundamentally different schools of thought.

4) The govt size is massive beyond your comprehension if you think it isn't big in the first place. When accounting errors in the defense department reach $2 trillion, you don't get away with ""I don't think the govt is too big"". It is incomprehensibly massive and it will continue to get bigger as socialists like you with no understanding of economics keep voting in people like Elizabeth Warren and the more mainstream partisan voters keep voting in warlords in chief who have no comprehension of economics either.

5) In essence, if you're socialist, we have a fundamental difference in economic thought - you don't understand money and I do. I'm also a finance professional so I'm doubly qualified than the average layperson in addition to my own fiscal leanings. We will not find common ground and while I rage impotently online against people sealing our economic fate, you give them more power with your vote."

The bipartisan doctrine of the elites on the other hand, is something called neoliberalism. Don't buy into the neolib vs neocon dichotomy. They're the same people and all they care about is indirectly enriching themselves off tax payer dollars. It is why govt budgets have never stopped growing in size whichever side gets to power. Liberals don't play coy on that aspect and cleanly admit to supporting bigger govt while conservatives talk about smaller govt but steal from the table at about the same rate."
