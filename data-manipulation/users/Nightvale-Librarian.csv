I also fully expect a model to relax into a pose over time, so settling into a position is normal. Also, don't be afraid to quickly stretch or flex during a very long pose, as long as you return to the same spot. You may find it helpful to have the artist place masking tape to help you return to the pose after a break - around the toes especially."

You can look at it in a mirror, or step a few feet back every now and then while drawing. It's also good to have an honest buddy. And measure measure measure! It helps to include a smidge of background, too. This way you can measure not just between body parts, but also the angles of limbs compared to the arm of a chair, or the placement of feet to the edge of a rug."

ArtCrit,fcewhn8,t3_eh3bzj,1577624369.0,"It looks like you drew this from a photo. If that's all you have access to, fine, but drawing from life is much better. Being able to see the figure in the round as you translate it into 2-dimensions helps you learn form. Also, with a defined time limit, you become better at deciding what's important to your drawing and what to ignore. 

Don't concentrate on the tiny details at first. If you're wanting to improve your knowledge of Anatomy, ignore tiny details. No pretty eyeball drawings in life drawing - unless the rest of your drawing includes that same level of detail. That isn't what you're here for. What is the overall gesture? What are the big main angles to reference? Where are the feet and head in relation to each other?

Good anatomical drawings are about the relationships and proportions of different parts of the body compared to others. In this drawing, the legs look like they belong to someone else. In your next drawing, if you think something is off, start measuring. Maybe the torso is as long as the model's hip to knee, the foot as long as the face, etc. Compare and adjust. There are rough guides for this, but remember they are only guides since it will change based on your viewing angle and the unique body of each person.
