asl,ffdnfai,t3_esvlp1,1579824595.0,"I'm an interpreter and I partner with our school SLP often for Language therapy for the DHH kids. Though she is gaining fluency, it's so nice to work with interpreters too because it's direct instruction on how to use an interpreter and also play with the language. For example when we study multiple meaning words. One word can have 4 or 5 signs associated based on the concept.

 We also work on ASL content standards. Can a DHH student use ASL features for clear communication?  (Google ASL content standards by Gallaudet)

So yes, gain fluency, but also don't be afraid to work with your friendly neighborhood interpreters as well. :)"

There are plenty of other iconic letters instead of abstract ones in ASL that are sprinkled throughout. C, I, J, L, M, N, O, V, W, Y and then Z all look like their English counterpart."

relationships,feoedq1,t3_eq6sj1,1579299027.0,"If he cared about you in the slightest, he would not make this be situation about him. He would be there, just to be there FOR YOU while you grieve over your friend. 
  
In my group of friends, we go to funerals for each other's families. Not cause we are grieving for the deceased person. But because we support our friends who are grieving. 
  
This dude is supposed to be your boyfriend. That's a whole other level above basic friendship.   

He's not supportive and doesn't care about your emotional needs.   

The fact that he doesn't have empathy for you is a huge red flag."

Really the temperature is nice. If anything, it's refreshing. The problem is the strength of the stream it shoots. That took some trial and error to figure out what's effective. Lulz."

Also worth it: a $30 bidet from Amazon."
todayilearned,fczw4br,t1_fczuroh,1578109621.0,"Huh. Thanks for answering. It sounds similar to SimCom which is a form of signed English, commonly used 'with' ASL. The goal being to voice whatever you're signing, but then you change the ASL structure and you're left with a weird signed English which wouldn't be understandable to a monolingual ASL user.  

Is Makaton widely used in certain countries? I've never heard of it in the US and I'm an interpreter."

todayilearned,fczcq58,t1_fczb137,1578098295.0,"That's insane. And also not a CPS offence.

I work with deaf children and with the amount of feral children we meet with severe language deprivation is astounding and infuriating. By the time we get them at 3 years old, it's too late to catch them up. 

 Parents that couldn't fucking bother to learn/teach any sign language end up with kids who are severely impaired in many ways besides their hearing loss. Behavior, emotional, linguistic, social, common sense, etc... 

We've checked. Language deprivation is not a CPS offense, though now some states are starting legislation to ensure Deaf children can get resources before that critical language window closes. 

Sorry, I'll hop off my soapbox. I just think it's so funny that many hearing families believe in baby sign language and then families of deaf babies are on the opposite end of that. Sigh."
todayilearned,fczbzsf,t1_fczafqc,1578097861.0,"I've seen research that supports the opposite, but it's always worded as ""Sign language encourages and cultivates COMMUNICATION."" Doesn't have to be verbal."
ASLinterpreters,fcwe2x5,t3_ej518a,1578023291.0,"It was very similar to the BEI I, just a bit faster paced and with more serious content. The BEI I was more general and k-12 focused. Think about more quasi medical and quasi legal situations. Do you work in VRS at all? It would be similar to something you may encounter there as well."
