When students ask about it I tell them to strongly consider engineering unless they know what they want to do with a physics degree. 
Doing maths solely usually comes with computing which is very useful to lots of things. You can do allsorts with a physics degree but often requires some additional training (second degree, masters in engineering for example). Engineering just has more doors that’s all. For the best of the best I send them to physics degrees and they’ll do fine. Most of my other physics students ended up in engineering jobs after going to uni.

kendo,fddt22s,t1_fdaddqk,1578323255.0,That’s sounds about right. Cut. Move forwards and extend arms  ie don’t draw arms back.

kendo,fd5q3fr,t3_ek3se4,1578180203.0,"I do iaido (drawing a blunted katana and performing short kata) and kendo. In no expert in either just to be clear (3kyu and ikkyu respectively) but I had this conversation jut recently. 

In kendo you cut through or cut and sort of push the blade forwards as fits with the whole ‘going forwards’ spirit of kendo. (Happy to be corrected here) but this seems to come from kendo as a sport using a shinai and showing spirit and sword control etc. Therefore as you’re not actually cutting it serves more purpose to slide the blade forwards to serve the needs for kendo (does that make sense?)

In iaido you’re using a real or blunted katana and ‘actually’ cutting ‘ real’ (imaginary) opponents. Either way the cuts I’ve been taught here are similar except there is no pushing forwards and cutting through. In fact you cut while essentially stationary (can move before and after) but most cuts are a slice. 
Eg a men cut is brought over in an arc and then arced back towards you slicing through towards yourself as you might imagine having to do with a real blade. 
You see this I think in kendo kata 6, perform the suriage men, cut to the head and step back into jodan but you draw the sword back through the face as you step back. This isnt exactly what iai cuts feel like as they’re more fluid but it’s the same idea. 
Be interesting to see if anyone who actually knows what they’re talking about can say though!!

Edit
In answer to your second question it’s kind of above. Kendo is built around the sport and the sport uses a shinai. Therefore developed techniques evolved to make a shinai strike better/faster etc. The kata ARE kenjutsu that’s true but kendo is not really the kata. Basically there’s a lot more kenjutsu out there that very much like the kendo kata. In my opinion studying the kata will improve your kendo. Many disagree and think they’re archaic and obsolete. These are the sport purists. That’s fine but I like both aspects. 

We’re very lucky our sensei knows several techniques and teaches them to us for fun/ aid the kendo/ keep tradition alive / keep fluid thinking / give us ‘outside the box’ techniques we might actually use in kendo take your pick. It’s awesome! 
Iaido (I do elsewhere) is more like kenjutsu but it’s the equivalent of gunslinging. Quick draw, kill and enemy on the street, clean and sheath sword. Kenjutsu is a bit more about sword already draw and moving across a battlefield (like kendo kata)  bit I know less about this. Other than there’s loads of styles and schools. 
I’m told doing it can help your kendo. That why I’m doing iai. If there was a kenjutsu school nearby id do that too but sadly not."
