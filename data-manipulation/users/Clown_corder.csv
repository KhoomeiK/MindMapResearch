Liberal,fgmgepd,t1_fgmd5tu,1580924018.0,Ngl I don't think I'll vote if Bernie isn't on the ticket. Just isn't enough of a difference from the status quo to matter. The other candidates don't offer much in my eyes over trump. And I would rather wait another 4 years of trump and actually have another set of progressives to choose from than have 8 years of a moderate Democrat.
sleeperbattlestations,fglm1wm,t1_fgl78zx,1580903926.0,I love the dochpac builds every time I see them. I just wish I could find one I could afford to build in lol
whitepeoplegifs,fglill4,t1_fglbzgn,1580899631.0,Kinda hard when the Republican senators won't let evidence be presented in the trial. Vote them out.

CamilleMains,ffxld2i,t3_euebs1,1580327479.0,I played against two setts so far and shit on both in lane. When it comes to late game your best bet is to obliterate his teams Carry's before you go on him.

Amd,ffvgmus,t3_evc94o,1580263659.0,I run a 5700xt myself and it works for me because I know how to tweak the settings to fix any issues that might arise but I would never put one in a customer build or a build for a friend. They just require to much tweaking to get right if they aren't working well.
rpghorrorstories,ffrbgdd,t3_eujykt,1580154576.0,"That's so awefull, I definitely understand not wanting to play d&d after an experince like that with such a bad dm and a group that didn't stand up for you. If you ever want to try d&d again I'm dming a Homebrew campaign that starts this Saturday. It's a few groups of guys at different colleges so we are going to be using discord so you can join online if you would like. Its a very nice group with no one anywhere near that bad(the worst we have had is a dragon fucking bard and a little bit of muder hoboing but I have that all under control) and I can guarantee that shit like what your dm pulled won't fly with my group or in my campaign. Pm me if your interested."

It's already fixed in this one but I didn't post it here because it's only got like 3 Camille clips and I didn't want to get reported or banned."
