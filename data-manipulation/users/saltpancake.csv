JUSTNOMIL,ffhmomw,t1_ffh76gg,1579942664.0,"I dated a guy in high school whose mom kissed him hello and goodbye on the mouth. The first time I saw it it sort of short-circuited my brain and I had no idea wtf was going on. I brought it up to him later and he said it was super normal, why would that be weird? It’s just a peck so why is that any different than kissing his cheek? Yeaaahhhh.... still weirds me out."
AmItheAsshole,ffhmf9e,t3_etfr3u,1579942273.0,"NTA. Out of curiosity, does he also make you throw out things you owned during other relationships? Are you allowed to keep a necklace you got as a valentine’s gift, or a keepsake from that trip you took? Because if not that is serious bad news — like this."

apple,ff7i4bt,t3_ervva9,1579650082.0,"Not a tech support really but a purchasing question — I want to buy the 16” MacBook Pro and am not sure which upgrades are worthwhile, particularly for video cards. Here are my needs:

-	I want to invest in a good machine I can keep using for a long time. 
-	I do professional graphics work for a living, but do not edit video. 
-	Primary use is Adobe Suite, with files averaging ~500MB-1.5GB

Any recommendations for what upgrades would either be worth it or a waste of money for my use case would be appreciated."

No, not for that reason. 

Isaac was a family member. His loss was shocking, horrible, and quite difficult for a lot of people — and his absence is still felt, I promise you. 

To say that this utterly tragic and senseless death is actually a faked excuse, and that the family is in fact lying to cover up his sexual exploits, is disrespectful to the man himself and to the very real grief still felt at his untimely death.

I think that if anyone said that of a loved one you lost tragically, that the way they died was probably a lie and a coverup, you might also wish to speak up.

todayilearned,ff3jvsz,t1_ff22q77,1579542606.0,"It was as largely to do with the incredible stigma that surrounded HIV at the time — patients were treated like lepers, not victims. The doctors were not at fault; this was before transfusions were tested routinely. A lot of lives could have been saved if the taboo of HIV hadn’t prevented these kinds of checks from being implemented for so long."
todayilearned,ff3hwdt,t1_ff2rlpq,1579541389.0,"It was a tainted transfusion. The bypass itself was a risky surgery and his family was so relieved when it was successful, when it was determined he would live. The shock and distress of finding out that the lifesaving surgery would ultimately kill him was a terrible experience for everyone involved — not just a loss for the sci fi community, but also a personal tragedy for old friends and young family. Please don’t spread this kind of conspiracy speculation; it really does his memory a disservice."
todayilearned,ff3gs17,t1_ff2dpty,1579540712.0,"I want to counteract the narrative that it was to save the doctors’ credibility. There was a truly overwhelming amount of social stigma at the time, which played a major part. As with many HIV-related practices, discussing it openly from the beginning would have saved lives. It’s a real tragedy that so many were lost because of stigma."
todayilearned,ff3fvu0,t1_ff1xe2f,1579540209.0,"Thank you for posting. And to all the people talking about how he was bullied into it to save the doctors’ asses — okay, maybe it was good for them, but the prevailing issue was the sheer amount of stigma HIV carried at the time. To be open about it was almost unthinkable as pretty well-known public figure. A large part of Janet’s decision to come out about it was due to how much the conversation about HIV had changed in the intervening years."
Persona3,ff0zm8w,t3_er17r2,1579473789.0,This would be amazing.
JUSTNOMIL,fewmr0a,t1_fevminj,1579414961.0,"Yeah this was my question too! Every time I went dress shopping, it was the opposite problem — they keep a pretty large size in store so that everyone who wants to can try it on, but then things like V-necks are way out of proportion on smaller people, with huge gaps across the chest. 

I get that you can use rubber bands for the back if you go smaller, but for things like arms and bust, a size 0 just won’t scale. How could you even get your arms into a sleeved gown if you were a 10? It’s very strange."
JUSTNOMIL,fetdi3z,t3_eqemvk,1579374232.0,"I’m allergic to amoxicillin, and we found out the same way. From my understanding, it’s very common to find out via a rash as an infant, as that’s when most people are first exposed, and the most common reaction. In my case, it was apparently a very severe one, and as a result I’ve never had any penicillin-family drug for the last thirty years (which can suck, but only moderately. The “second choice” antibiotics are rough, but it’s not a hard workaround.) 

I have been told that as common an allergy as it is in childhood, it’s also common to grow out of it, which could explain how your husband has made it through life not knowing. In my case, I’ve never risked it, but who knows? 

I am pretty shocked that your MIL never told your husband, as it seems like he’d need to know, even if it turned out to not be as severe in adulthood. 

I hope your LO feels much better soon. Please take comfort in knowing that while it’s a bit of a inconvenience sometimes, this is an allergy that is very easily navigable in adulthood. 

Obviously IANAD, and your mileage may vary, but I would also add my experience with benzoyl peroxide just as a heads up. It’s a topical medicine used to treat rashes and/or acne, and is in many dermatological skincare products. The most common side effect is a rash. If you’re allergic to it, they treat you with amoxicillin. If you’re allergic to amoxicillin, they treat with benzoyl peroxide. I’m allergic to both, and it’s a miserable feedback loop because the backup treatments for exposure to either are slow and hard on your system. Hopefully this isn’t necessary in your case at all, but in a few years when skincare products  for teenagers become more relevant, it might be helpful to keep an eye on the ingredients just in case."
