tasmania,feg6uw6,t3_eovv4o,1579079761.0,"To answer your questions.  Firstly, as a non-local you'll have allow more time for the locals to acclimatize, but you'll find other non-locals there as well so that'll help.  The mining has contaminated waterways miles from Queenstown so it has to have done damage to the ground there too, how much I couldn't say.  It's very unlikely you can hunt your own meat in any meaningful way, except fishing (if you're willing to drive to the coast - they had a Salmon breakout at Strahan recently, apparently people were catching tens and even hundreds of atlantic salmon each).  I work in education and I get mixed reports about the schools, most teachers don't want to work there, so there's that but you will get some good new teachers who're doing a stint there to try and get enough brownie points for a permanent job elsewhere.  There's also a small private primary school and some kids even board in Burnie to attend one of the schools there.  Without mining most people move away, the rest must be in some other service industry I guess.  If the mine is closed (I think it is now), it's a short trip to Rosebery and that mine is open and pretty stable - it \*seems\* like it's not too hard to get a job there either.  Yes, it does get more remote, try [Lorinna](https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-08-09/inside-lorinna/7704416), it was basically a hippie commune when it started and parts are still true to that.  Also, Zeehan, Miena, Moina, and Tarraleah.  I think you could open your own business, but it might be better to make friends first."

tasmania,fefd990,t1_fefcxsh,1579053825.0,Not putting the blame on the addict is empathy. In fact I'd say being mindful of an individual vs. a collusion of government and industry is definitely showing empathy. Seeking to change that imbalance would be further empathy or compassion.

history,fdpi8ly,t3_em55al,1578629331.0,"I come from a family line where I'm the first in many generations not to be a fisherman.  The stories I've heard about the abundance of fish just 50 years ago are amazing to me compared to now.  Overfishing has reduced wild fish stocks by massive amounts.  The worst affected are fish available close to shore, which of course affects the poor first, now only those with expensive boats and/or commercial operations can access large regular catches.  And it's much harder for them than it used to be too.

It's now to the point where common fish my Dad would consider a pest in his regular catch now sell for three times the price of chicken."
