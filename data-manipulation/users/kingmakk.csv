An early morning

the sun was bright

lo bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao

on a clear sky

a black cloud appears

enemy surrounding the horizon


Peshmerge arose

brave, with guns in their hands

lo bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao

behind a sangar (breastwork - fortification)

together, men and women

protecting their homeland

My beloved one

If I fall as a martyr

lo bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao

don't you ever cry 

over my dead body

just bury me in a quiet place 


Promise me that

until your last breath

lo bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao

the path to freedom, you will not lose

Kurdish independence, you never forget

I am well assured

there will be one day

lo bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao

our struggle will be victorious

independent we will live with pride


And you my love

promise me that

on the day of victory 

you visit my grave

and bring me the news of freedom."
