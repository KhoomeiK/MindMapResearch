widowers,fcx2d6j,t3_ej9syj,1578048150.0,"I think it's great that you're thinking about these things ahead of time for your daughters. I've been dealing with the flip side of that. I have three boys. Their father died five years ago, and it's been an adventure figuring out boy stuff I hadn't realized before enough though I have three brothers and male friends. It's different when you're parenting boys. 
The things that others have listed already are definitely good information. One thing I'll add is that a girl's menstrual cycle isn't always very regular in the beginning.  It can start off pretty wacky and then take some time to regulate to around every 28 to 31 days, although some women's cycles never really regulate. I think someone else mentioned using birth control to regulate this, but, of course, that's a personal choice. 
Your girls may also get really moody when they're about to start so just keep an eye out for that. 
Also I'm not sure if they still offer it, but I remember getting a free teen pack from a tampon company. Maybe it was Tampax. It actually had some helpful information about how to use them.  They can be tricky to insert when you first start using them, and you shouldn't use them for more than 8 hours, and you should use the lowest absorbancy for your needs.  Stuff like that.
I hope this helps. You can feel free to hit me up if you have any other questions."

answers,fcqiko7,t3_eidcgz,1577886628.0,"There are many community health centers and community service boards throughout the US that offer services on a slide fee income based schedule. If you have little or no income, often their services are very cheap or free. You can usually find good care at these types of places and if you need medications they can connect you with programs to get them for cheap. Just google community service boards and/or community health centers in your town."

I lost my husband 5 years ago unexpectedly and people said all kinds of things that actually hurt more than they helped. I was angry for a really long time.  Not so much anymore."
