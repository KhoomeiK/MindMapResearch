The distance between pickups (even on a regular guitar) is not arbitrary. Specific distances are chosen because they work well together due to the harmonic nature of strings. It's not the end of the world if it's slightly off but it does matter."

Your mindset needs to change. You're not going to get a decent pickup or preamp in anything less than a grand, and even then it's doubtful. Put the money into a decent pickup it really makes a huge difference. Just because the instrument only costs $150 doesn't mean it's not ""worth it"" to put in an upgrade. You can spend $800 and STILL not get decent electronics. 

What's more cost effective? Putting $150 into an instrument that you know works, plays, and sounds great or spending $600 on something that still isn't the best and could benefit from an upgrade anyways. I get that you're more inclined to upgrade something nicer but I really do think an upgrade is worth it so long as there's nothing wrong with the instrument.

That really is your best option. Those preamps built into the acoustics mostly are pretty junky. You already see why.

I like the hybrid systems. Often they'll have an under saddle pickup along with a microphone or transducer. The blend really helps get a more natural tone compared to only an under saddle pickup and you can usually adjust it so you get a wide range of tone."

guitarrepair,ffda4tp,t3_esy89j,1579816435.0,"Short answer, no. Nobody even attempts fixing those.

Most acoustic preamps are circuit boards and they're usually custom. If that's dead there isn't much most people can do about it. If it's dead then diagnosing the issues on a circuit board would be more costly than a new unit, unless you just happen to have a micro soldering station and the electrical experience to diagnose those kinds of issues.

In order, check the battery and terminals (you already did that). Spray some contact cleaner in the sliders and controls, turn and move them to the extremes of adjustment. Check the wires for disconnection, fraying, or corrosion. Replace or test the output jack. If it still doesn't work after all that it's busted and you need a new one."

Luthier,ffcwypq,t1_ffcmjbe,1579809002.0,"The above post is wrong and misleading. 

There are several methods but the rules are all mostly the same. First, you don't want to go grounding everything to everything. That's how you CREATE noise, not reduce it. 

The star grounding method is the best, most common method you'll see in guitars. Pick a pot, that's your ground. Most people pick a volume control but it doesn't matter. The ground of every component gets connected to that pot. You don't necessarily have to connect every part directly to it. For example, if you have 3 pots in a row you can chain them. So if pot 1 is your ground you can connect pot 3 to pot 2, then pot 2 to pot 1.

If you have individual volume controls I usually will connect the hot and ground of each pickup to its volume control, then chain them like explained above to the main ground point. If it's a master volume then the pickup grounds all go to the main ground.

Use the least amount of wire necessary. You don't want it so short it's difficult to work with but the longer the wire the more opportunity for interference and noise.

If you have single coil pickups with two leads (hot and ground) then twist them together. Sounds crazy but that will give you a LOT of noise reduction without any shielding at all. Twisted pair has been a thing since the early days of electronics and has been studied for decades. Do this on your output jack as well.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions or would like anything clarified."

That's not entirely true. And I do think some artistry is worthwhile, especially on a classical.

I hate apps in general (not just tuning apps, I mean mobile software in general) and they certainly don't have any business on my bench.

>Thank you SO MUCH for explaining this. I'm sure some of it was explained to me at some point

Possible but highly unlikely. It's not a well known fact, even amongst reputable techs. I only learned it recently and I've been fixing guitars for nearly 10 years.

>I know that it's a fad 

We'll as usual it's not like using thin strings at that tuning won't work, and it's obviously not like nobody does it, but you'll experience issues. Tuning stability will be greatly affected. Precision technique will be more difficult. But this is a subjective thing. Ultimately you can do what you want but there's downsides.

Not trying to undermine the rest of your post but go to the butcher. The one near me is unbelievably cheap, and the quality is 10x that of the grocery store garbage. I don't buy meat from the grocery store anymore. 

I pay MAYBE one dollar more at the butcher for the equivalent amount of sausage for example, and the sausage I'm getting is far superior and supporting local businesses."

Any tuner that's built into something else tends to be junk. It's better than nothing but I'd get a dedicated tuner. You don't have to buy a strobe, a regular stomp box will be a big improvement. But you get what you pay for. The strobe does make a difference. There is a reason why professional shops use them.

>Another question I had regarding intonation is whether its recommended to down tune the string after adjusting the saddle and lifting the string up and setting it back down onto the saddle. 

Why are you lifting the string? Just set the intonation.

>Also, say someone wants their guitar in C Standard rather than E standard. Should I redo the intonation when down tuning to C Standard, or should it still be good? 

Things get complicated here. Stick with me and I'll get to the answer. After any adjustment you should be checking it. Gauge change, tuning change, and truss rod adjustment will all affect intonation. This is why intonation is last in the procedure.

What the overwhelming majority of people don't understand is why we have to intonate in the first place. Strings have stiffness. When you pluck the string it's not vibrating from the edge of the saddle to the edge of the nut. The vibration actually starts a tiny bit into the playing area. Thus, the stiffer strings need the saddles back further. This is also a great litmus test. If ever you don't get the expected 3-stairstep pattern that's an indication of a problem elsewhere.

Most people mistakenly believe that changing the tuning slightly means you need to adjust your intonation. This is false. The reason people believe this is because if you tune your guitar differently, then check it, you WILL notice the intonation is off. However, changing the tuning isn't the culprit. It's actually the effect on the neck that changes the result. Even a slight change in tuning will result in the neck being over or under bowed and that changes the effective distance of the frets.

If you tuned your guitar, then adjusted the truss rod to put the neck EXACTLY where it used to be you'd notice no need for an intonation adjustment with the same set of strings. In practice it's extremely difficult to get an exact adjustment of this kind so often a minor adjustment is needed.

When I get a customer who tells me they play often in two tunings i.e. Standard (EADGBe) and D standard (DGCFAd) I'll set up the guitar in Eb to split the difference and allow for the most leeway.

Lastly, using the same gauge for E and C standard is ridiculous. You really need a thicker gauge for C standard to work and be playable instead of floppy garbage."
