Its great to have people like you.  Its totally motivational to start every day with that attitude around.
Kudos for your boss, too."
Dogtraining,fft51nx,t3_ev3d9b,1580207496.0,"Ignore every dog, until they give you the response u want.  Teach them patience, and that only play and going out will happen when they are calm.
Do not do anything and let them get bored until they are how you want.  Thats the secret.
Watch some youyube vids on this.  I apply this when going out.  Dog should stay down some time calm, even with the door open, until some time passes. Just until that moment we go.  It might pass 10 minutes, just have the patience to make them learn. That tempers a dog excitability.

Watch ""capturing calmness"" of Kikopup on YouTube.  Look how calm and tempered their dogs are.
Good luck"

BorderCollie,ffssu5s,t1_ffs3j4n,1580191193.0,"Just a hollow hexagonal rubber ball.  Great to chew on, great as throwing ball, great as soccer ball, properly easy for the dog to grab it with his mouth, and perfect for thug of war play.  Its the best rubber toy ever, more than kongs.
Always have one handy with the dog, anywhere.including his kennel.
By teaching the dog to always have a toy, he can redirect his energy to the toy itself instead of something else.  The dog gets used to toys, he mostly ignore other objects"

Dogtraining,ff28oje,t3_er733k,1579497053.0,"Crate training is one of the best things for dogs.  They learn patience and calmness.  Owners should let go out dogs ONLY WHEN CALM, as every other activity.  The dog learns that only play or going outside happens when being calm.
Potty training can also be teach there.  Get the puppy out of the crate with collar and leash, and 1st take it to poo/pee in the desired place.  Tell him the order like pooo, and he will understand quickly.
Always remember taking the dog out after 2 hrs, and take.him.to pee first. Oh and always leave a sh1t where u want it.to do it.  They smell the poo, and that triggers the need to take outnthe thrash."
ToyotaTacoma,ff1u126,t3_eqszlz,1579486171.0,"It doesnt depends on what country... Its the same.  Its just the philosophy on just few updates and not trying to polish everything.  Toyota doesnt care about improving the ride, a polished stereo deck, a logical and quick.navigation, bettering the interior lighting, better seats, a truly powerful and solid drivetrain, a good keyless remote, quicker window motors, led headlights all around (tailights were converted from led 2nd gen to bulbs 3rd gen), or anything that resembles the true search for being the first, top choice.
The construction of the entire truck means they care more.about profit than really giving the top effort.
The opposite is Driving a recent mazda. Polished everything, great ride, less jarring and more composed, good auto drivetrain, nice cloth on seats, good sounding base stereo (bigger speakers, clear solid bass), very well thought controls, superb aestethics, reliability but with soul and good taste.  Just flicking the controls, they feel good, solid, feeling.alive and alert, with intelligent simplicity. 
Ive got 2 toyotas. An inherited 2006 rav4 and this 2015 tacoma 4x4 that i bought for.my father that no longer is on this earth.  Both soul sucking vehicles. Awful interior, subpar plastics and with 200 textures all along the same car, mediocre speakers and sound, old engines, terrible seats, same 90's switchgear.  Just old Toyota philosophy.

I wont ever buy any toyota.  They work well and require less maintenance, but at the daily grind, they consistently give you depression.  Just like living life without any shining moment."
