I made one contrarian point about how cracker vs the n-word is an apples to oranges comparison because the skin color of the target also changes, and you've now decided I'm totally cool with racial epithets. Is THIS really the forum to call me apathetic towards actual racism because I split hairs?"
hockey,ff9j6vo,t1_ff96bkc,1579714147.0,"I am saying context matters, but not word choice. Using ANY slur against another person is racist, full stop. The intention to denegrate someone over their skin color is inherently racist, the word choice doesn't matter.

The reason I called out his example is because the reason cracker isn't as bad as the n-word is because slurs against whites have way less impact than ones against minorities in North America due to our racial history."
hockey,ff90nom,t1_ff868pi,1579701845.0,"This is disingenuous. You're comparing a slur against white people to a slur against black people.

iamverysmart,feeh61h,t1_fee65n5,1579033666.0,"I feel like there's far too many issues with your hypothetical to mean anything to this discussion. 

1. My biggest issue with the first hypothetical is that it's an outlier, and can be removed from the analysis as such. I also think you're severely overestimating this hypothetical smart kids ability to make a great engineer. What good is a skilled engineer who can't get along with others and disappears from his duties when he's stressed? 

2. I think this description fits the majority of engineers I work with. Hard work gets you far in life, so does building workable relationships with peers/people with authority over you. And I think you're being misleading with the framing of this scenario. Did the student not improve at all through his homework and extra credit? Even if so, the grade shows the person makes up for their insufficient intelligence with hard work, which brings me back to my initial point, that grades tell a very broad picture of your ability to be successful in the workplace, and cannot be the end all be all measurement."
iamverysmart,fedyori,t1_fedqllr,1579022683.0,"Whether or not this is the case for you (you're also only 21-22, so I'm not sure what kind of experience you're point is based on. Surely part time work or lower level jobs from huge companies probably don't care about grades) but I have had to provide college transcripts for many jobs I've applied to post college"
iamverysmart,fedy8dg,t1_fedt6cg,1579022411.0,"That's fair, I didn't put much consideration into the noise part. Although I disagree that grades aren't valuable because they don't immediately tell you what thing is pulling the result in a direction. To me, that just says it isn't a catch-all metric. This is why interviews, applications, essays, etc. exist in college applications and job interviews, so the areas of deficiencies can be more specifically defined.

An A student still, by your own admission, is more apt to skills needed for career success than a D student. All your point indicates is that B and C students may very well have a lot of the skills to be successful, but other factors (that do matter in career success) are pulling down their score"
iamverysmart,fedo70y,t1_fedl845,1579016247.0,"Literally the only reason in your story that your life turned out great is because you actually started giving a fuck in college.

1. The grunt comment is a point about my own position in a company and my level of autonomy, it has nothing to do with ""learning to code"" (I teach programming, so I'd love for people to learn it, but I don't give a fuck if you don't)

2. I agree with the systematic issue, and I do not know how you determined I didn't. On the ""if everyone did it, it wouldn't be in demand"" comment, that's largely untrue on what you are trying to say. Yes, if more programmers enter the workforce, the value of software devs would go down.
