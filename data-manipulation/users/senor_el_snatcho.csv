EdmontonOilers,ff3lbsr,t3_ere9eh,1579543487.0,It was a treat seeing that the Hockey Guy moved the Oilers from 17 to 8 on his latest Power Rankings. Thanks Shannon.
EdmontonOilers,fezt044,t1_fezmzpt,1579461267.0,That is a bullshit fantasy. The reality is that the Laffs are the only Original 6 that has never made it to round 4 of the playoffs.
EdmontonOilers,ferkivs,t3_eq7v4v,1579355075.0,That is an insult to turtles.
EdmontonOilers,fenxlni,t1_fenwi8p,1579292318.0,I was thinking the same thing. The Knights were better off with Gallant.
EdmontonOilers,fen3aoa,t3_eq1fxt,1579276023.0,The parity in the Pacific division and the wild card spots is insane this year. My best guess on which team will drop out of the race is Las Vegas and / or Winnipeg. What do you guys think?

EdmontonOilers,fegyply,t3_ep3bcd,1579105483.0,Vegas Golden Knights have fired Gallant and hired deBoer as their new head coach. I will take this as good news.

EdmontonOilers,fee39d6,t3_ejkyyc,1579025489.0,Kassian will get a standing ovation when he comes back. I could watch that beat down a million times.

EdmontonOilers,fdqr8ru,t3_ems2f0,1578673160.0,"Watching the Oilers get outplayed in the first period I was thinking ""Aw fuck not again"". It was great seeing the boys comeback and get the win. They need a better start against the Flames."
EdmontonOilers,fdpfjuk,t3_emkibq,1578627317.0,Numbers time. Oilers have 53 points now after 46 games. There are 36 games left on the schedule. If they win half of those they will have 89 points. The Avs made the playoffs last season with 90 points. If the Oilers can get 41 more points they will finish with 94 points. That should be enough to either finish 3rd in the Pacific or get a wild card spot.

EdmontonOilers,fdnm401,t3_ejkx9p,1578588655.0,Bring the A game tonight guys. Phoning it in when facing struggling teams has cost us way too many points this season.

aww,fde6ou8,t3_ekudd8,1578332369.0,Thanks. I really need some happy news today.

EdmontonOilers,fdcbara,t1_fdabd8m,1578270847.0,Raanta just got hurt. Kuemper is already out so the Coyotes are down to their 3rd goalie. I'm hoping the Oilers can catch them.

EdmontonOilers,fcy0vbb,t3_ejghzi,1578073210.0,Kovalchuk signed a deal with the Habs. The Kings played better after he left so I'm glad the Oilers didn't grab him. I really don't know who the Oilers should try to get to get them out of this slump.
