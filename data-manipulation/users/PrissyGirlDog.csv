I asked her what kind of dog?  I left and went on a leash walk. Really??? Oh yes, my dog is a bulloxer."
dogs,ffg1gmf,t3_etd5f7,1579896396.0,Or even the opposite! I have had my girl assaulted by running up to a large intact pointer who was on a leash in an off leash park... How was I to know he was leashed and unstable! My girl was scared and that stupid owner tried to say it was my fault ugh!!!

Dogtraining,ff4bxm4,t1_ff48t6g,1579560008.0,look up using a tool/toy called a flirt pole.I use one with my pit bull mix and she is getting a lot of her fixations out there. It also tires her out to be calmer on the house.
whatsthisworth,fezht0c,t3_eqywhk,1579457487.0,"I know about the wooden one. It is called ironwood or some variation on that name. a very heavy(?) feel to it. If you use simple dark brown shoe polish you can restore the look of the original coloring. it is found as tourist item anywhere from Mexico to Bahamas Bermuda etc.

My husband collects it and we have paid from 30 dollars in a flea market to a couple dollars at the goodwill or yard sale."

dogs,fd9jr2o,t3_ek4rw0,1578234312.0,"when my family adopted a stray pointer, we let her in the house to live. Be careful not to startle or get too close when your new pup is sleeping until they get used to their environment. Outside dogs have some different behaviors at first. :-)"
