relationships,fgambw3,t3_exoz8v,1580652948.0,why not go talk to the two he cut off. your group is giving this person too much power to solely decide who is in and who isn’t
relationship_advice,fg6gr3j,t3_ex6tb2,1580567517.0,why wouldn’t you ask for child support?
offmychest,fg6a116,t1_fg69lw0,1580560909.0,"i’m sorry they’re like that. you need someone else to share your pain with. having your feelings constantly invalidated makes it worse bc then you start to even question if you’re important as a person and it leads to very bad self talk.

if you have therapist money, go for it. if not maybe try to convince your mom to pay instead of sending you off to the ward? 

i know it’s going to be super hard to accept but maybe you just can’t share your life with your family for a while. or maybe you need to have a big conversation with them and tell them how you feel (individually maybe so less pressure) but i feel like a therapist or friend who knows the whole situation could better make that call"

AmItheAsshole,fg697hf,t3_ex5cl1,1580559892.0,ask them first then if it turns out they lied to you you kinda have free reign to yell a little. the cooks in the place i work never hold back their comments tho so maybe i’m just used to vocal cooks
AmItheAsshole,ffwo12y,t3_evn8as,1580306719.0,NTA -  you don’t work you don’t eat was one of the very basic rules in a lot of households. also the fact that she tried to say “you won’t kick me out” just shows she’s ready to take advantage of you the second you let her

AskAnAmerican,ffb2gk2,t3_eshnrz,1579750115.0,"it’s definitely over portrayed but i think it really depends where you live. i lived in harlem (NYC) and there was HEAVY interaction, in many different forms, but then i moved to upstate new york and interaction dropped significantly. 

but if you’re only talking about interaction as in being pulled over then i do have to say i’ve been pulled over twice upstate (speeding 100% my fault) and never when i lived in the city. so i think location plays the biggest part in that answer. 

i think skin tone also plays a role in it too (idk if that’s too controversial to talk about here though)"
