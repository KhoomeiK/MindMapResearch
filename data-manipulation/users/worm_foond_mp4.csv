titanfall,ffgfc7b,t1_ffgesji,1579904967.0,"Both Ronin and Scorch have playstyles and kits that can directly counter each other. It all comes down to skill: a good scorch against a good Ronin will often result in a stalemate, and I recognize that. Im not a good scorch, not by a long shot, but i find it easy to take down anyone who rushes in without thinking. Playing against a good Scorch is like playing a horror game: you're just cruising down towards the front line, and suddenly a big papa just jumps out from behind a corner, throws down gas traps, and melts your Titan down into slag. That's why he's good against any brainless rushers, not just Ronin."

Exodus was fun, but an open-world game doesn't really work with a linear storyline, especially with such a small amount of levels. each level is huge, with plenty of side missions and fun secrets, but still. it just felt... off to me.

Plus, Josuk8 only wants to help his mother, and right now, the head doctor is keeping him from doing so. If he tries to get the rokakaka, then yes, Jobin will try to kill him, but since the rokakaka was shown to be ruined in the most recent chapter, I don't think that's the case.
