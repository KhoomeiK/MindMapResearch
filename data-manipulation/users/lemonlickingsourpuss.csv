I was a seriously toxic person, constantly putting everyone else down. I was horrible, and I insulted and hurt people because I was insecure, I hated myself, I hated my body, and I hate myself for being so insecure and cruel. I knew I was being cruel and it was just like this torrential flood and I could not stop it. After some therapy, some soul searching, some crying and a lot of sleepless nights I’m doing better. I didn’t just lose weight, I lost a lot of negativity and even set off on the road to repairing some relationships I thought I’d ruined with my horrific attitude. I didn’t want to see other people succeed where I had failed. I didn’t want other people to be happy when I couldn’t be, and it felt like they were rubbing it in my face that they were so joyous and successful and I was a sad, pathetic, failure. It’s so toxic, and it’s a cesspool. You find other people who are just as nasty as you are, and you feel accepted and justified. I wouldn’t of gotten out of it if one of the few real friends I had left hadn’t been so patient and called my bullshit. Told me I was super negative and she was so sick of dealing with me. I absolutely love her and she’s my best friend, and I didn’t want her to start hating me so I started hanging out with her friends instead of the people who just encouraged my negativity. It helped a lot. Now I see why people share, and why they celebrate. I’ve lost a lot of weight, and I’m fucking proud of myself. I took control of my life instead of spiralling further down, and that’s a lot of work. It was hard, but it’s getting easier by the day. I want to celebrate that, and I want other people to join me and be happy with me. I want other people to do well too, and even if someone is doing better than I am, I am genuinely proud of them, because they worked so hard to get there and I know one day I’ll get there too. It’s not a race, and everyone goes it at their own pace.

My little brother started crying because he was being bullied at school and he was ashamed because he couldn’t just “man up” and handle it.

There’s also clinics in a lot of places that do a sliding scale payment based on your income and in my experience a lot of those places are also willing to do payment plans. It’s not ideal, but it’s something if you do need it."
tumblr,fdns00a,t1_fdnda9q,1578591651.0,"Yeah, great healthcare is for people who can pay for great healthcare. Meanwhile I’ve needed a root canal for nearly a year but haven’t gotten it yet even though I have dental insurance because I’d still owe almost $1500 out of pocket for some fucking reason. I was suddenly taken off of antidepressants (very bad thing to do) because when I switched health insurance when I got married my old doctor wouldn’t accept the new insurance, but the new doctor couldn’t see me for 6 months. When I ended up in the ER with very unpleasant side effects from suddenly stopping a medication I’d been taking for a couple years I got slapped with an $800 bill. So saying America has great healthcare is misleading. It’s only great if you could already pay for these ridiculous expenses out of pocket already.

Edit: And this isn’t the “best” dentist either. This is a crappy dental office, but it’s better than nothing."

TheHandmaidsTale,fd7dfbp,t1_fd7d29w,1578202742.0,"Yeah that is a good question. My mom was very concerned for the baby when she watched the episode with me and she let out a little cheer with Nicole whacked Emily in the face with her little fist. I legit thought the baby would be dead when they got out of the water because it’s just so much water. But I feel like I’d be on an FBI watchlist if I googled how long newborns can hold their breath.


Edit: Apparently up to about 6 months old babies will instinctively hold their breath when submerged in water, TIL."
TheHandmaidsTale,fd7bpmk,t1_fd7aqe9,1578202049.0,"Exactly! When Emily escaped I was crying like a baby. I was on the edge of my seat worrying for her because I knew the consequences for failure were unimaginable. When they caught up with her at the border I was almost panicking, and when he launched into his speech about being a refugee and if she’d be persecuted upon returning to her home country I burst into tears and hugged my sister who was watching with me. I was so scared for her, and I want that kind of emotion back with June’s character. In season 2 when they were all lined up in the stadium I was actually, genuinely concerned. That scene made me cry and I loved it, and I miss getting that kind of reaction for June. I don’t want her to fail, but I want to actually feel for her instead of just “Meh, she’ll be fine. She’s always fine, so who’s gonna be tortured in her place?”"
TheHandmaidsTale,fd79zsq,t1_fd76jx6,1578201385.0,"That’s a fair point, but I feel like it still isn’t much compared to the others who’ve done far less and ended up far worse. Sure it’s tortuous, but she should be up on the wall at this point. For plot reasons I see why she isn’t, but the least they could do is cut off a hand or take an eye or something. Just something that gives us some sort of urgency at the situation, something that shows us June is still fallible and won’t always get off easy. If she suffered some actual, lasting consequences it would be nice. Madeline Brewer, I love her, she’s been wearing all that eye makeup since day one pretty much. If she can do it, I think Elizabeth Moss will be just fine dressed up like she’s missing some digits or something. They don’t have to kill her, they just have to actually show us that Gilead is a horrible, oppressive regime and bring back the tension that made season one so great. I was legitimately scared for June back then. I was worried about what would happen to her because even her small acts of defiance could have huge consequences. But then she slowly morphed into an untouchable entity and it’s ruining the tension that ran so high before.


Edit: Solitary confinement IS torture. There’s no doubt about that and I’m not trying to dismiss it. But the issue is that her ordeal was pretty much forgotten as soon as the episode ended and she was allowed to leave."
TheHandmaidsTale,fd785za,t1_fd778g2,1578200691.0,"Yeah Fred has obvious motivation to let her get away with things. Even Serena has a reason for letting June misbehave, she wants a baby and then she wants the baby back and June is her best shot at that. But I never understood how she can sit there and back talk the aunts, back talk the guardians, and just cause so much trouble. As someone pointed out she does end up getting punished at the hospital but that’s a really light punishment, like I know it’s torturous to be on your knees for so long in what’s essentially isolation, but it still seems to pale in comparison to what the other handmaids are put through. I just can’t have sympathy for June anymore, because at a certain point she’s willingly hurting herself for nothing except dramatic effect and dragging others down with her, others who almost always end up worse off for having known her."
DAE,fd714ev,t3_ek4f61,1578198169.0,"I don’t bother because I’ve literally never succeeded with a New Years resolution. When I wanted to lose weight I started in like June and actually lost weight. When I wanted to stop biting my nails I started trying to quit for good sometime last fall I think and finally stopped. It’s not about when I start, but why I start. If I’m just starting because everyone else is I’m setting myself up for failure because I’m not really ready for a change, I just want to fit in. But if I wait until I’m truly ready to improve, it works out."
TheHandmaidsTale,fd6rjmk,t1_fd6f238,1578194840.0,"That always annoyed me. I get she’s the main character but she never faces any sort of repercussions for her actions. So what she had her feet whipped at the red center? She’s been bitch slapped? That’s nothing compared to the other handmaids. The girl who had her tongue removed? The FGM? Being locked in a room for a couple months is still nothing compared to the other handmaids. It’s always something with June and she gets away with it time and time again. It’s frustrating, because her behaviour is so outlandish she’d of been put to death a dozen times over if she was any other handmaid. There’s no tension anymore, because we know for a fact that June can do whatever June wants. She’ll never get in any trouble, she’ll get chastised and then we’ll get a 5min close up of her smirking face as she happily ignores everyone and then goes right back to doing whatever she wants.

Edit: Not a main character, THE main character. My bad."

I had a doctor offer it when I had my IUD replaced and it makes all the difference, it doesn’t really hurt going through the cervix after the numbing but you still cramp up. It did pinch because she injected something into my cervix but still I highly recommend being numbed if you can. The first IUD I had inserted was a copper one which is slightly bigger than a regular IUD from my understanding, and the second was a tiny hormonal one they recommend for women without children."

If that’s not a fucking cult tactic idk what is. She literally targeted a vulnerable woman and outright said as much so she could shill her particular brand of bullshit. And then if you asked her any questions she just dodged them.

Googling something about phone calls dropping after 2 hours brings up a bunch of results about shady carriers trying to save money, or trying to gouge businesses who use conference calling or as a preventative measure so people don’t burn through minutes with a pocket dial, keep networks open, etc. So, it’s a thing apparently.
