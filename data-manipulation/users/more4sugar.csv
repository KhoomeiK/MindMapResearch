Hyundai,feyxkum,t1_feyv2xk,1579451675.0,"I'm still on the fence. I currently drive a 16 Camry, and it's a world of difference from driving my friends CH-R on may occasions, and I love so much about it that tiny crossover except the sluggishness and slow pick up.

And I keep having second thoughts on just going for the turbo, because after one test drive I fell in love with the peppiness, but the base engine still is amazing for it's class and ride.

I guess whichever best deal I can get will decide it"
Hyundai,feyu9b5,t1_feystyp,1579450592.0,Thank you so much! I'll definitely keep checking 19/20 SEL+ models.

I'm trying to tons of extras spares since they get very pricey buying online. And hope to find a used board under $50usd somewhere nearby.

And for some reason the boards are $80-$150 where I live, versus over there its <$10 and customs mades going to $15-$25 at most"
boardgames,feyr6rg,t1_feyqqn8,1579449625.0,"Thank you, your right! I called the airlines they said no problem as a 2nd luggage"
boardgames,feymm6h,t3_eqs3vs,1579447635.0,"I need advice fast, I asked a family member to buy me a board game overseas since it can be personally customized.

They are worried about bringing it back, they said they might take the board game as a carry on, but unsure they can go through with it or security might stop them

The size is a square 27in x 27in and made out of wood and thats it, game pieces will be in luggage

I can ask them to opt out to smaller board that 20in x 20in too
