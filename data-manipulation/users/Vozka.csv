AdvancedProduction,fft40a5,t1_ffsz3z5,1580205902.0,"Yeah, but above he's also confused why the interface only influences playback quality and not export, and asking why the Scarlett doesn't make his mixes more clean. Not sure why you're being passive aggresive, I agree 100% that good loudspeakers are absolutely essential for a producer, it just seems that op's confused about what he actually wants and needs."
AdvancedProduction,ffrv1pk,t1_ffrqbh8,1580166476.0,"I don't think this is what he means, and if he does, he's really bad at saying it. He's complaining that better speakers only affect playback quality and not export quality and saying that he wants a ""device that let's me export AND playback cleaner"".  
  
My understanding is that he's getting good sound in the DAW but thinks that the quality of exported files is bad for some reason, which is of course unrelated to loudspeakers or audio interface (unless he's doing something very wrong)."
AdvancedProduction,ffqypeg,t3_eumtba,1580146626.0,"> I THOUGHT that if I get new monitor speakers then connecting with my audio interface, I would have higher quality audio exported versus my speakers but it's only higher quality in playback.  
  
I don't think it has been repeated enough in this thread: your speakers or your interface have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of your sound export from the DAW. Whatever is happening, it is purely an internal software issue."
cfs,fflgcj0,t1_ffl18v4,1580039350.0,"Since this seems like woo and will probably be downvoted, I'll add to it: I also read Reverse Therapy after getting a recommendation from somebody I trust and I believe it's a pretty good book despite some obvious flaws.   
  
The main flaw is that it's essentially a psychosomatics book despite explicitly claiming to not be (although he sees psychosomatics as a trigger to cascading physiological processes, not as ""the problems are in your head""), and has all the typical downsides that come with that - the authors sources are not solid science but years of empirical data. Therefore it is inevitable that he has some bias. We also now know that at least in some cases, psychosomatics as a trigger is pretty unlikely, so it only applies to some fraction of patients.   
  
However! Everything that he writes about is really solid advice about mental health and life attitudes in general and I have no doubt that living according to his recommendations will make your life happier and more comfortable even if it has zero effect on physical symptoms. And since I know a guy who went into remission as a result of this therapy, I have enough reason to believe that it does apply to some people.   
  
And the same applies to meditation. It did not help me with any of my physical symptoms, but it made them so much easier to deal with and be productive despite them, it's really hard to overstate the benefits."
audiophile,ffev9eo,t1_ffdl31n,1579867026.0,"That is one out of many different gimmicks that they have historically used. And if you think that their engineers did not use measurements when developing it, you're quite naive and obviously don't know much about loudspeaker design."
audiophile,ffdjqiw,t1_ffcgrh6,1579822339.0,"Again, this may be what they claim for marketing reasons, but not how their development is actually done. You can look up some of their patents."
audiophile,ffbrhvf,t1_ffbjxcf,1579779885.0,"Yes, this is correct, because by lowering volume digitally on the phone you're effectively reducing the bit depth, therefore raising the noise floor. This is however usually inaudible because phone DACs are pretty decent nowadays, so generally if you're anywhere near maximum, you're not degrading anything.   
  
This is different with bluetooth where the noise floor is often riddiculous so if you set your phone to minimum volume and compensate on the amplifier, it will sound terrible, so maximum volume is always recommended.  
  
There is one exception: some phones have surprisingly loud headphone outputs and some (especially cheap and crappy or very old regardless of quality) amplifiers tolerate lower maximum inputs. If these two meet and the volume is set to maximum, clipping may happen. So if you hear any distortion, you can try to lower the volume to say 3/4 and check if it sounds better."
audiophile,ffbqf53,t1_ffayi2z,1579778513.0,This is really not true. Bose did lots of research and owns numerous patents related to (psycho)acoustics. It's just that they always used psychoacoustics to cut costs as much as possible while still being attractive to their customers. I would say that they're pretty successful at that.
Brno,fe9gpfq,t3_eo6m2b,1578937392.0,"It might be reasonable if it's a very good big room in a good spot, but you can surely find cheaper. We rented our 32 m2 room with furniture next to Lužánky park for I think 7,6k a year ago, although the flat and furniture are quite old."

audiophile,fdhtscr,t1_fdghq6t,1578430016.0,"Don't, most of this is useless advice. Egg cartons do absolutely nothing in the bass frequencies (see [for example here](http://www.acousticsfirst.com/eggc.htm) ), acoustic foam does very very little. Denser acoustic materials like mineral wool do work for bass management, but you need to use a lot, and while mineral wool bass traps will likely improve the sound for you, they may not do much for your neighbor. The positioning of the absorbers behind ports is bullshit as well, bass is omnidirectional and it does not matter that much where the port is facing with regards to noise travelling through the house (not saying that positioning the sub will not help - it has a big effect on the overall sound and it might help, but it's not this simple and predictable. You might for example put it farther from your neighbors wall, but by doing that excite a resonance that travels through walls more easily).  
  
I would try putting more flexible material under the sub as others suggested, but it's possible that the noise is not coming through foor vibrations and that your walls simply are not soundproof enough in the bass region. And due to how bass behaves in small rooms there's not much you can do with that except listening quietly, or soundproofing every surface by essentially building a room inside the room using acoustic materials, which is of course so expensive that only person I know who did that was a professional drummer."
audiophile,fdhqcq5,t1_fdhdasb,1578428088.0,It is quite possible that your phone won't support it either. But at least it will make the next generation of products better.
audiophile,fdhq1ht,t1_fdhh5px,1578427901.0,"Vanilla aptX is actually not great, its only advantage is that whereas standard bluetooth audio SBC is only good when using its maximum quality and almost no manufacturer bothers to specify if that is the only quality they use, aptX only has one quality level, so you have a guarantee of it being good enough. aptX HD is good, but just like aptX it's licensed, so you always pay more for the chips, and LDAC is the same case I think (I'm not sure, but the chips are currently super expensive).  
  
So a high quality codec that would not require the manufacturer to pay additional licencing fees and would lower the power usage due to requiring smaller bandwidth, while additionally finally supporting streaming to multiple bluetooth devices at once (this is a huge pain right now), would be honestly awesome."
YouShouldKnow,fdgm167,t1_fdfbou9,1578401849.0,"Adding an opposite experience, neither I nor any of mi friends had an issue with this and we all love the app. If you use android, you can subscribe through google play (and still use the account anywhere else, not just on your phone), which than handles the subscription just like with any other app with in app purchases, meaning you can unsubscribe anytime with a few clicks.  
  
edit: although unless you use a family plan (which is essentially a group plan, they don't check if you live together etc) it is quite expensive, so checking the Smiling Mind project might be a good idea. I genuinely think that Headspace is great though."
YouShouldKnow,fdglusx,t1_fdfw5m3,1578401681.0,"Adding to this, when buying the subscription on an Android device, cancelling is as easy as opening the subscriptions section in google play and cancelling it. Done it last month as I was switching to a family plan, which I thoroughly recommend as they allow just using it with a group of friends (as opposed to for example Spotify), and the price gets so much lower."
YouShouldKnow,fdgloxa,t1_fdfxoie,1578401523.0,"It is not clear at all what the issue was. It probably depends on how you buy the subscription because I was subscribing through google play and all it took was opening up the subscription section in google play and clicking unsubscribe, literally 3 clicks and done, no issues."
NoStupidQuestions,fclltiw,t1_fcla9iz,1577750797.0,"Any kind of basic meditation where you normally focus on your breath should work very similarly if you focus on repeating a mantra in your head instead. In fact, some schools prefer that. [Advanced Yoga Practices](https://www.aypsite.org/13.html) is as far as I know a pretty good source which tells you to repeat the word ""ayam"", although it's not really important what word you use as long as it doesn't have a meaning which would distract you. They do eventually suggest to add pranayama breath excercise to your practice, but you don't have to do that until you're comfortable (even if that means never - meditation alone does wonders)."
programming,fc5hrrg,t1_fc5956u,1577457956.0,"> If you are not a developer, there is no reason to use it. And if you are, just use macOs: unix system with a great user interface. Just great, not for retards.

I'm not saying that MacOS is for retards like he is, but it's really not great if you're a developer or a similar kind of power user. A simple example: a common thing you want to do especially with a laptop, if you spend a lot of time typing and want to be efficient, is to use the mouse as little as possible and control the system with a keyboard - it's healthier for the wrist and simply much faster. The support for this in MacOS is pretty terrible compared to Windows or Linux and can't even really be solved with 3rd party apps. It's also not very customizable overall."
