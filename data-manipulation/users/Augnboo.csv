Marriage,fe5t9xi,t3_enil2o,1578874453.0,My Ex....watched porn I never minded that but when he moved on to online sex and dating sites.  That put me over the edge.  I tried talking to him he totally denied it even when I caught him red handed.  He still denied it and told me I was crazy.  Shortly after that he was coming home late or had hours missing in his day.  Yeah I left him!!  His loss.    That was my experience ....I'm not saying your husband will do what mine did.

DeadBedrooms,fdowg7s,t3_ema20w,1578614436.0,I can understand both sides and I agree you need her to understand either partake in it with you or let you find another partner or get divorced.  I don't understand how if the other person loves you how they don't want to be with you.....at least once and a while??  I have pain but I love my husband and I want him.  Also I don't want him cheating on me.  Good luck I hope it all works out for you.
EarthPorn,fdovc2d,t3_em7kc7,1578613706.0,That's so cool looking.  Thank you for sharing it!!
