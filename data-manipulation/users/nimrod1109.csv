AmItheAsshole,ffimb7z,t1_ffim30l,1579977293.0,So a chore I’m 98% responsible for I should change how I like to do it for the 2% of the time she does it? Lol
AmItheAsshole,ffilmp5,t1_ffgt53i,1579976823.0,"So kinda funny. If I put dishes in the dishwasher after dinner one night, not enough to run, and she is doing them the next night she will unload all the dishes I put in and rearrange them. She does the same thing if my mom is visiting and loaded the dishwasher. 

I don’t just throw things in. I load it like I have always done growing up. Plates and bowls on the bottom shelf, cups and stuff on the top. She likes bowls on top and cups with the plates on the bottom. 

I usually do dishes every night, so I’m not gonna change when it’s something she deals with a couple times a month."
AmItheAsshole,ffil6z0,t1_ffgnw2n,1579976520.0,"It’s definitely interesting seeing the difference in opinions. A lot of people are saying “I would rather put it away correctly” and a lot saying “trying and failing is better then not trying” 

My wife is very particular. If I load all the dishes after dinner one night, not enough to start the load, and she is putting them in the next night she will usually unload all the dishes I loaded and rearrange things. She will do the same to my mom if she is visiting. Constantly rearranging things we clean up. I don’t just throw things in the dishwasher either. Just arrange it the way we did growing up. We always put bowls on the bottom rack with plates and cups on top. She likes cups on the bottom rack and bowls on top."
AmItheAsshole,ffikmrb,t1_ffhr7rl,1579976137.0,"Our only real “split chores” are cooking and laundry. Everything else just gets done. I might bathe and get the kid ready for bed 4 or 5 nights a week. I tend to work out at night. So I’ll usually clean up dinner, get the kid ready, take the dogs out, and go work out from like 730-10."
aww,ffiae90,t1_ffhyzob,1579969157.0,Are they dog friendly? I’ll have to check them out next time I’m down there.
todayilearned,ffhfa89,t1_ffgn8mi,1579932815.0,And that’s only kinda a natural lake. It was damned up by a natural long jam. The long jam was removed for river commerce. The lake level fell and a man made damn was built.
AmItheAsshole,ffh5gwm,t1_ffgq8k0,1579923645.0,"I grew up in a pretty big family. We had a huge washer that probably did the equivalent of 3 Norma loads of laundry at a time. We would fold laundry on the living room floor. The first (and only) time I dumped out laundry on our floor and sat down to fold it my wife almost had a heart attack! Lol 

It’s interesting the different way people do the same chores. The sibling-in-laws have complained together about it before. Growing up dirty dishes always got set in the side of the sink that had the disposal to get rinsed off and moved to the dishwasher. Apparently this is not the normal way? 

I mentioned in a couple comments this definitely was not a huge or anything like that. Clothes were put away and we went to go have a beer at the brewery before we had to grab the kiddo."
aww,ffgxpqq,t1_ffgx76q,1579917747.0,Denver bouldering club. Great gym
AmItheAsshole,ffgm5wz,t1_ffgkb6x,1579909450.0,"We definitely didn’t get into a real fight over any of this. It was really her expressing her frustration when she got home. No screaming or yelling. 

I just wanted a reality check from an outside source."
AmItheAsshole,ffgm0g5,t1_ffgafiz,1579909348.0,"I definitely feel like my clothes are a bit easier. If they are pants they are all in a drawer together. She seems to have three drawers of pants. My T-shirt are I’m a drawer. She folds some and hangs some. 

This wasn’t “fight” level by any means. She just expressed her frustration. I figured I would get an outside opinion to check."
AmItheAsshole,ffgltph,t1_ffg9wrf,1579909221.0,"She definitely does the bulk of the laundry. It’s our trade off. I cook dinner almost every night. 

I honestly believe guys clothes are bit easier. I mean I have dress shirt, shirts, pants, shorts, socks, and underwear. I don’t care if my jeans and hiking pants are mixed. She has had three different drawers of pants it seems. I don’t understand what T-shirt’s are folded and what are on hangers in the closet."
AmItheAsshole,ffg7h4l,t1_ffg76t5,1579900108.0,I probably should have a included it in the main post. Yes she does the majority of laundry. It’s kinda an agreement we have. She hates cooking. I cook dinner almost every night. She does laundry. I hate folding.
AmItheAsshole,ffg5y6a,t1_ffg3b75,1579899163.0,Yeah she just started hitting the gym again.  Means she has been waking up earlier then normal so she can get in before work.
AmItheAsshole,ffg5twq,t1_ffg4pj3,1579899090.0,"It really wasn’t a “fight” just a couple comments when she saw the hamper on the bed. 

She just started going to the gym again. So she has been waking up a little earlier then she’s used to."
AmItheAsshole,ffg57hw,t1_ffg4zfw,1579898712.0,When we are doing laundry together I only put away mine and the kids. She puts away her own
AmItheAsshole,ffg4p1k,t1_ffg3z7u,1579898397.0,If I’m around I’ll put them away/ help fold. Usually she does laundry while I cook dinner though. She absolutely hates cooking.

InsanePeopleQuora,ffcvdcv,t1_ffcv0r3,1579808042.0,For a few states yes. The majority of states there is no such thing as a gun permit.
InsanePeopleQuora,ffcsoq2,t1_ffcs3fh,1579806465.0,"A concealed carry licenses is not a gun permit. It’s a permit to carry a gun. There is no link to a specific gun with the permit (in most states, I think California does make you get tested with each individual gun and lists it on your license)

A class 2 license is specifically for an FFL. It allows manufacturing of title 1 and title 2 firearms. It has nothing to do with ownership."
