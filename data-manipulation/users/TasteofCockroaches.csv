AmItheAsshole,ff5q0pr,t1_ff5nlag,1579605482.0,I'm not entirely sure. She just kind of threw the idea at me and expects me to arrange a bunch of things. I'm guessing she's busy with other things herself since I know she has a bunch of health problems.
AmItheAsshole,ff5fqnx,t1_ff3mybn,1579590904.0,Thank you very much. I hope it will go well.
AmItheAsshole,ff5fq27,t1_ff3ms45,1579590883.0,"I'll look into that book, thank you very much for the suggestion."
AmItheAsshole,ff5fcdz,t1_ff3osra,1579590424.0,"I'm sorry, I'm a pretty bad person. However, I don't believe I said or implied this. It isn't that I don't want to, it's literally impossible to do this as much as I want/am expected to do. I have one body, I'm only one person, and I can only be in one place at a time."
AmItheAsshole,ff5f3hb,t1_ff4lwwe,1579590131.0,I'm really sorry. It's not intended to come off as condescending to her. All I wanted is for her to be happy.
AmItheAsshole,ff3udce,t1_ff3r4v3,1579549048.0,I will attempt something like this. Thank you very much.
AmItheAsshole,ff3mpez,t1_ff3jn4k,1579544341.0,"She has never planned for my birthday before, but that is understandable since she isn't very good at organising things. She does usually get me small gifts on my birthdays, though. I think it'd be mean from my side to expect her to give back what I give to her in any way, however."
AmItheAsshole,ff3c878,t1_ff3a99x,1579538286.0,That makes me really happy to hear. Thank you.
AmItheAsshole,ff3bv91,t1_ff2qr9e,1579538105.0,"I've been on and off re-reading this comment for a while thinking of an appropriate response and well, I think you might be right, maybe I'm being a complete dick towards myself. I'm currently looking into options for therapy so that I can maybe learn to love myself more than I currently do and stand up for myself in the future. I'm a complete doormat."
AmItheAsshole,ff39q9w,t1_ff39ego,1579536990.0,"I really hope so too. As of now, the trip is still a surprise for her, but as soom as the rabbit it out of the hat, I'll make sure she knows that if something goes wrong or she's feeling uneasy, she can and should always contact me."
AmItheAsshole,ff38l6r,t1_ff35qg5,1579536252.0,"I'm not sure if they're aware, but I'm also not *completely* worrying about it? The friend with anxiety has been to America multiple times (from Europe) so this isn't the first time she's going far away for a long time. In fact, we went to London for  a concert not long ago, and she was the one who knew her way around the airport very well where I was having trouble finding how things worked there, as I've not gone out of the country as much as she has. Everyone in this situation is an adult, btw."
AmItheAsshole,ff3795i,t3_erblh9,1579535362.0,"Dear everyone,

This thread has been a huge wake-up slap for me. Thank you."
AmItheAsshole,ff34sfj,t1_ff2wprd,1579533671.0,"This is not a trip I'm going to myself. The friend that has anxiety has a habit of locking herself up a lot, which ends in a downward spiral because then she'll be alone with her own thoughts, and you know how that goes for people with anxiety. The friend with the trip idea got this idea to get her out there so she can do fun stuff; she has to go out and see the world and get away for her own thoughts for a bit, that's the basic idea. I don't have enough money or time to go with them and it has never been the plan that I were to go with them, but I do have the money to pay for a part of the airplane tickets as an early birthday present."
depression,feggyi4,t3_eoxun3,1579092421.0,"This is very familiar, yes. Things getting better or getting too happy makes me feel very on edge and scared. I definitely don't deserve to be a happy person and should it happen, then it all feels like it could tumble down again at any moment."
Advice,feg7j6q,t1_fef608w,1579080720.0,I believe you're replying to the wrong thread.
Advice,feedpf6,t1_fedmobe,1579031632.0,"I could definitely attempt to use the gynaecologist example to explain things, that's something I didn't think of. Helped"
Advice,feedhq1,t1_fee6zwc,1579031505.0,"'Work-obsessed' very much explains my boss, and she expects everyone to talk about work-related things during lunch break, and she's known for being unable to empathise with people that don't think exactly the way she does, so I'm afraid saying something about needing alone time wouldn't convince her. I can try to explain it to her, though."
AskReddit,fed8yxx,t3_eoke7u,1579004125.0,"It's perfectly okay. Sometimes, shit just hits the fan so hard that you don't see how  things could ever get good again. There's no need to feel 'guilty' or 'selfish' for feeling suicidal in these moments like people often try to convince you to feel. 

I hope you'll be able to move forward from your current situation."
AmItheAsshole,fed3dg7,t3_eo5hft,1578996775.0,People like you are the reason some (younger) people with PTSD don't feel like they'll be taken seriously and therefore don't look for help.
AskReddit,fecyd2l,t1_feak15x,1578989705.0,"Eh. Apart from having a different subculture behind it, I don't see furries as any different than other types of cosplay. There's the same level of character and craftsmanship behind it."
AskReddit,fe8pp9q,t3_eo3u22,1578929016.0,I cosplay. It's easy to explain the professional looking photoshoots and modelling and going to tons of fancy locations and all that up until you reach the point where you have to explain all of that is because you're playing elaborate dress up. As an adult.
AmItheAsshole,fe8fals,t1_fe6tm2k,1578925562.0,"I guess she wasn't, even though it's a bit hard to process since we have a whole lot of fun, fairly recent memories together and I kind of feel like she doesn't attach much worth to any of that by just kind of, I don't know, ""ditching"" me? I'm probably wrong for thinking that, though."
AmItheAsshole,fe8eod1,t1_fe6uff9,1578925343.0,"I would if I could while still sounding honest towards myself, sorry.

This friend is pretty sensitive to criticism, which she can't really do much about, but I know she'd take it the wrong way if I told her about me feeling uncomfortable with her new, better friend and see it as me being unrightfully jealous or not supportive of her happiness. This thought makes me feel wrong about being jealous."
AmItheAsshole,fe8anba,t1_fe7615d,1578924283.0,"I have this comfortable level of ""I barely talk to them, but I know we're there for eachother"" with a few people since I'm kind of shy, but she is not one of those. Maybe it's due to how quickly our friendship went from really close to really distant that might be causing discomfort. I don't know, it may also be because of this third person she now gives all the 'titles' she first gave to me. I don't know for sure if she'd be there if shit hit the fan for me now, and that makes me unsure whether it'd be appropriate for me to come to her aid if something goes wrong for her as well, as much as I'd want to."
AmItheAsshole,fe86kvf,t1_fe6wqv2,1578923117.0,That is true.
AmItheAsshole,fe856ov,t1_fe7y2wf,1578922708.0,"I really would if I knew a way to do so, without feeling like I'd be lying to myself. I'm sorry."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe5088i,t1_fdl2jy4,1578864476.0,I did never state it was as dangerous as. I just wanted to take the opportunity to rant about a type of medicine that has more or less destroyed me when it's the subject matter because its something that bothers me a lot but I can't cope properly or talk about it to anyone because everyone I know says its been good for me. Nothing more.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdk5al9,t1_fdjlgqi,1578496387.0,"To add to this, two of the most-prescribed types of medication for ADHD, Ritalin and Concerta, contain methylphenidate, a drug that falls under the same category as cocaine.

With *just* the right combination of unwanted side effects, the effects of ritalin/concerta versus meth shouldn't even differ that much :)

Source: was misdiagnosed with ADHD, and couldn't feel emotions anymore for the 8 years I was forced to take meds for it. Medicine is FUN"
SuicideWatch,fddjec4,t1_fddicva,1578314635.0,"If there is a way forward, I don't know how to find it."
offmychest,fddie74,t1_fddi8x9,1578313530.0,I'll read up on it. Thank you.
offmychest,fddhke6,t1_fddgay9,1578312575.0,"I'm sorry, I don't believe I'm as mentally strong as you say. The things that have happened left me in a kind of difficult place. I skipped a lot of school when I was younger because I was either busy with therapists or too scared to attend class due to bullying. I failed university in my first year because my dumb ass wanted to study psychology, which triggered my illness more than I was able to handle as soon as family dynamics and similar things were discussed. I'm constantly on my toes when outside the door because I fear people might attack or harass me and with my only real social life taking place online, I kind of go on and off on whether I can consider people ""safe"" enough to be a ""friend"". That is, until they find someone better to replace me, of course.

I really don't see how anything that has happened has made me stronger, to be completely honest."
offmychest,fc3kbwv,t1_fc3k37c,1577391701.0,I will try my best. Thank you.
offmychest,fc3jusw,t3_efztjp,1577391390.0,Being in a first world country with good economy and a roof above your head doesn't necessarily equal a happy life.

selfharm,fc3ivma,t3_eg0327,1577390781.0,"I used to do my arms, but for a few years I've been doing it on my thighs instead; with arms I find that I have to be very careful and the cuts often accidentally slip into visibility. I don't have to worry about that when they're on a place that doesn't become exposed as often."
selfharm,fc3ikq3,t3_eg00wt,1577390588.0,"I was clean for 116 days and thst all went down the drain mere minutes ago. Old habits are hard to kill, I guess."
