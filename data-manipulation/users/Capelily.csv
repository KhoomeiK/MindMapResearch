Our economic infrastructure is built on a tower of sand. I use SNAP benefits, as do most low-wage earners. Thus, this country (and our taxes) is subsidizing us ""poor folk,"" rather than paying us a living wage which, in my (humble) estimation, should be around $25/hr. **and** a 40-hour work week."
