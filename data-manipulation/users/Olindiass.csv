I looked into a lot of little rodents, but eventually it switched to lizards... and I bought a chameleon (I know, they're a pain to take care of). Even though I'd heavily looked I to how to care for chameleons, actually buying one was kind of a whim. Now, I'm kind of obsessed with all kinds of reptiles, and just bought my second, this time a snek!"
