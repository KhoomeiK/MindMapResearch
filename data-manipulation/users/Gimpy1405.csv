While, under other circumstances, your point would be correct, say if the OP were *intending* to buy a second car, or the issues involved were the fault of the customer. Then the huge depreciation would legitimately be a burden for the OP to bear.

But, the OP was merely getting work done on their car and had not signed onto taking a big hit. Warranty work is supposed to be cost free for the customer.

Imposing this cost on a customer who thought they were getting warranty body word done is neither fair, equitable, appropriate, nor reasonable. Once the dealer accepts the car they take on a responsibility to care for the car while it is in the dealer's (or their sub-contractor etc.) custody. 

The dealer owes the customer no less than to be made whole - an equally virtually new car - and - no huge cost penalty in the thousands. Any other outcome is absurd."
Cartalk,ffuasgi,t3_ev8tuj,1580238064.0,"Since they did the damage, ""they"" being the dealer and the body shop, and since you did nothing wrong, it is up to them to ""make you whole"", i.e. not leave you worse off than before you arrived. For them to offer anything less than an equal replacement is unacceptable. They should not be leaving you owing more, or driving a lesser vehicle.

Several things to do:

1. Get in touch with the owner of the dealership and indicate that the options presented so far are unacceptable.

2. Get in touch with *your* insurance agent and see how much they may be able to cut past the deadwood at the dealer - bodyshop  to get to a better outcome.

3. Call your state attorney general's office and ask them what help they can offer and what paths they may suggest.

4. Call the national / regional ""zone"" manager for the make of car you bought. Appraise them of the situation and tell them you are very unhappy and want them to push downward on the dealer.

5. Post on the sub for legal advice here on reddit - r/legaladvice.

6. Be prepared to speak to a lawyer - but wait on that until other avenues are unproductive.

7. A long shot, research lemon law in your state. Since the whole mess began with a defect covered by warranty, lemon law provisions might have been triggered. Might. A long shot but why not?
