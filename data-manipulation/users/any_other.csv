It‚Äôs all in his rhetoric.


‚ÄúIn no other capacity is a problem solved by not talking about it,‚Äù Kendi said. ‚ÄúAnd yes, it‚Äôs extremely hard to treat racism. It‚Äôs extremely painful. Just like it‚Äôs extremely hard to treat cancer.‚Äù


For Kendi, there‚Äôs no middle ground. Actions, ideas and policies are either racist or not. He points to the fact that racist has a dictionary definition, one that should be applied evenly to anyone, of any race, who expresses racist ideas or who supports racist policies.

He contends that white supremacists have won the rhetorical battle by successfully positioning the term ‚Äúracist‚Äù as a personal attack, that being racist makes you a bad person.

‚ÄúWe should not be saying this is who a person is,‚Äù Kendi said. ‚ÄúWe should be saying this is what a person is doing in the moment. And the reason that‚Äôs critical is because when you study the history of racist ideas and antiracist ideas, you find the same person saying both racist and antiracist ideas in the same book, in the same speech, in the same article. So then, how would you define that person in a general sense?‚Äù"
politics,ff32zb7,t1_ff31k6h,1579532337.0,You can either be racist or antiracist. Being ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù ‚Äúnot buying into identity politics‚Äù is racist because it supports racist systems.
