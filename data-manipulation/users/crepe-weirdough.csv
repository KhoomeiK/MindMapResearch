insanepeoplefacebook,ffqd87i,t1_ffpx0kk,1580131014.0,"Lol maybe, but basically I'm a people pleaser, to the point where I've done what I can to make others happy if I care about them, even if it's hurting me. It leads me to being manipulated very easily, and to not standing up for myself. In turn, this leads to fostering resentment, and making my self esteem lower. It's kind of a horrible cycle that is hard to break, and even when something seems to be helping with breaking it, I feel like I'm a bother or annoying, so sometimes I convince myself people would be better without me, or that they're not talking to me for their benefit, just for mine, or that they wouldn't notice it if I disappeared. I'm working on getting into therapy, but it's been hitting some roadblocks.
