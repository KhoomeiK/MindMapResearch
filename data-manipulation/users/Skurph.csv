todayilearned,ffvhbyd,t1_ffvfjm5,1580264119.0,"I'll be honest, I've never read that before, but I think that is one of the things about this case that I've noticed, the details wildly vary depending on what you read. 

I guess that's the issue with a 130 year old event where you're going from the first hand accounts of factory workers and guys who were hired days before to go and break it up. 



I'll say that in terms of the escalation it's always seemed to me like both parties were set up for failure. A lot of the Pinkertons weren't these battle hardened mercenaries, they were guys out of work looking for jobs and hired a day or two before. The Pinkertons had a reputation though and who knows if that increased tension.



I think Frick/Carnegie had to of known it would blow up so to speak but just wanted it over."
DCUnited,ffvgi4f,t3_evc86c,1580263574.0,I feel like a lot of our signings have the right mentality but ownerships unwillingness to financial commit and Ben's inability to adapt really hampers a lot of their spirit.
todayilearned,ffvegkt,t1_ffvdf37,1580262208.0,"This is where I'm waaaaay out of my depth and would welcome other input, but I'll give what my understanding was.


First, if i'm not mistaken, the country didn't really have a substantial law enforcement presence at that time beyond local police. When the ""authorities"" were called in it was the national guard.


But I think the bigger thing at play was the governments outlook at this time on business and their role.


Homestead goes down in 1892, we're still a long ways off of trust busting and government intervention. It seems like the prevailing belief at that time was that the government has no real role in interfering in business, and that these big businesses were essentially good for the country as a whole. My understanding has always been that the government expected Carnegie and his workers to figure it out on their own, when it got violent it became their issue and the PA governor sent it the national guard. Once the PA governor sends int he national guard they end it as quickly as possible, that takes away all leverage the strikers had. I'll be frank I have no knowledge that supports this, but my assumption is also that the governor felt like having Homestead operating was better the state and thusly had incentive to side with Carnegie. 


Workers rights have a slooooow up hill battle for the next few decades, and it's not really until the horrifying triangle shirtwaist fire that the government feels somewhat forced to finally step in and start to regulate things. 



Again, that's my rudimentary understanding of the whole thing."
todayilearned,ffvbs9n,t1_ffv7lda,1580260407.0,"""Gladly work for the lowered wages"" is a bit of an oversimplification.

The people who were taking those jobs were often immigrants who had no other options and were living packed with other immigrants in shitty tenements. The factory owners then turned around and would perpetuate exactly what you're saying ""look, i'm a business, you're real beef should be with the guy stealing your job!""


The narrative of the immigrant ""stealing"" a job from the hard working American has literally been around since immigration first started. I always will be the first to point out that you cannot steal a job, it has to be given to you by someone with far greater power."
todayilearned,ffvbc07,t1_ffvak9y,1580260102.0,"So this is the part that I'm admittedly a bit fuzzy on. In a lot of texts I've read they just say the workers barricaded themselves into the mill, but other things i've read and watched make it seem more like the mill was a town and the workers actually were barricading the docks so the Pinkertons couldn't get off of their boats and into the ""mill""

I've never really seen a map of what the setup was, but I think it's clear that it's not like what were thinking in a modern sense of being a physical building."
todayilearned,ffv9zpo,t1_ffv5zsd,1580259204.0,"The employees essentially considered the factory to be there own and not Carnegie's.

In their eyes, many of them had worked there for their entire lives, watched friends die there, etc. It was to them just one more injustice to be forced to leave it.

And Carnegie basically lets the dude take the blame for the whole thing because he wanted to pretend he wasn’t in the know.


The whole thing is wild if people don’t know the story.

Essentially;

-Steel has a bad year and Carnegie wants to keep his margins the same, they cut employee wages to do so

-Workers are already pissed about long hours and dangerous conditions so they go on strike and barricade themselves into the factory to prevent scabs

-the manager of factory (Frick) is given orders from Carnegie to break the strike, so he brings in the Pinkerton private firm (hired guns)

-rocks are thrown from the workers, the Pinkertons fire back, people die 

-the PA governor sends in the National guard to break it up

-workers go back to work and have to take the lesser pay

-some anarchist that read about it in the paper shows up to Fricks office and shoots/stabs Frick before Frick wrestled him down

-Frick misses like a day of work

(Full disclosure I’m pulling from memory so some finer details might not be 100% on)"
todayilearned,ffuxlf7,t3_evb40c,1580251271.0,"He also wouldn’t pay his employees a livable wage, and green lit the use of force that would break a strike and lead to massacre at his Homestead factory.

He’s a complex guy.


Essentially he is able to convince the public that he was a self made immigrant and the embodiment of the American dream. In truth he made his fortune from insider trading and aggressive business tactics that left a lot of damage in his wake. He peddles this idea that his workers can be just like him if they work hard, in truth he essentially shut the door and locked behind himself. 

He creates a lot of philanthropic endeavors during this time, but the prevailing belief amongst his critics is that it’s all PR to make him seem like a nice guy. Like he builds all these libraries, but his workers have 12 our shifts 6 days a week ( you got Sunday off) and most were illiterate, when the hell are they going to the library? Not exactly helping the common man. 


There is a great satirical poem written by a critic during this period called The Workingman’s Prayer for the Masses. Carnegie had just donated a new organ to the city church and essentially the author says “cool, I can’t feed or clothe my family because of your shitty wages, but thanks for the fucking church organ, what a great guy you are”

Listening to people talk about the games and having no skin in the game is refreshing and open. ""I liked XYZ about it, it's not perfect though, here's why....""



Whereas the awards part still boils down to the loudest person in the room and more often than not the arguments seem redundant and needless. I mean honestly I listened to all three of the first podcasts in their entirety, I skipped throughout all the others because i felt like points had been made and they were belaboring the same things. 




I think the crew should incorporate the idea of personal lists into the podcasts instead of awards.

giantbomb,ffav23l,t1_ffa7nl0,1579745158.0,"I think both of those games, and Outer Wilds this year, are games that really benefited from the crew working in a game centric environment. It seems like the excitement, shared experiences, and story telling between friends is what really drove those games for them. Hitman played alone is a fine game, but the crew enjoyed it some much because of the experiences they had together. A lot of their favorite games tend to work in that capacity, it's understandable, but not relatable. 


It's why after listening to every GOTY they've had I finally arrived at the conclusion that there is a fundamentally good game that is good regardless of the context and a ""good"" game that gains it's hype largely off of the shared experience. The latter are interesting to hear about, but they don't really do much for me. Gaming to me is a somewhat solitary experience, I don't really talk to my friends about video games so when the crew is really vibing off of each other and that's driving the conversation rather than specific game parts I know that It's probably not for me."

hockey,ffao0fg,t3_esg7v3,1579740444.0,"Three huge flags out of this story for me.


1. Apparently this happened in front of multiple people but there are zero corroborating witnesses.

2. The father brought his son to a chiropractor instead of a general practitioner. Not to shit on chiropractors, but they're not doctors. If my son had suffered potential trauma I probably would go to a doctor first. Additionally, doctors have a lot more ethics watch groups/guidelines so it's potentially easier to get a chiropractor to tell you what you want to hear. 



3. The team apparently was willing to negotiate with the family, and this lawsuit was only made public after they could not reach a compromise. They tells me that the family is likely seeking a financial windfall and the team understands that they don't have a leg to stand on. If the team was involved in private negotiations and was under the impression that this case had merit they probably would have done their damndest to prevent it from seeing the light of day.

For every one person who understands Dave is a schtick and unions are actually very good you had nine people going ""yeah El Pres, fuck unions, brick by brick"".



Even in this thread there is a mix of people understanding it was all a schtick, but also a large quantity that seem to actually think unions are bad.



I guess my question is at what point does the schtick not actually work anymore? When you start to find yourself flirting with 50/50 of people sincerely believing your character I wonder if you actually do have a responsibility to check out every once and a while and remind people ""hey for real though, this is just a character""


I would say that 99% of the Barstool personalities are pretty successful at doing that, PFT comes to mind as a guy who several times has dropped the act to explain that he doesn't actually agree with a joke he's making. Dave doesn't do that and I'm starting to think that the mouth breathers who slap ""brick by brick"" on every tweet of his maybe don't get that."
