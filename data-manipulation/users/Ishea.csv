spaceengineers,ffia4wv,t3_etpb1b,1579968976.0,Might be a little top heavy tbh. Taking sharp turns could tip it over.
tropico,ffhbe3w,t1_ff3tda9,1579928761.0,"I personally prefer having an extra docks, so the boats come more regularly, thus evening out the cash flow, instead of getting big lumps."
tropico,ffhb7g4,t1_fem87ah,1579928582.0,"They have since lowered the profitablility of boats. So this doesn't work as well as it used to. I've found that rum is generally also pretty good. So is Leather, which you can get directly from crocodiles."
tropico,ffhaz4r,t1_ffd1s80,1579928366.0,"There's an easy solution to that. The same solution that I used when I went for the ""90% of the population is of the same faction"" achievement. Kill every member of the royal faction."
Oxygennotincluded,ffg0yd7,t1_fff2k2o,1579896087.0,"Another addendum. While they don't activate, geysers that are in visual range ( aka you can see the neutronium base ), do 'activate' their cycles. So their active and dormant cycle does run. meaning that  it's possible that your geyser will go dormant soon after you uncover it.

This has to do with how the game saves itself some calculation load. Anything that is still hidden in the FoW doesn't do anything, only things that you can see have active calculations done to them. meaning that as long as you don't hit the space biome, no meteors, and any cold biome that you don't see will not change temps even if there's a volcano inside it.

See no evil, Hear no Evil :)"
Oxygennotincluded,ffeomqm,t1_ffee0cp,1579857622.0,"Nope, 'hidden' geysers do not activate until you remove the tiles on top of them."
Stellaris,ffa5w3s,t1_ff9i2u9,1579728496.0,"Downside is that it slows your population growth. I once had this pretty early but the race I had made ( lithoid ), had some growth penalties, so on top of those and on top of the lithoid penalties, my pop growth was sloooooow."

Eve,ff63h9h,t1_ff5hmlv,1579618195.0,"Welcome to Scanning! It's one of my favorite past times in Eve. And while I don't live in wormholes, I do like them, because I can just undock, find a random wormhole and see where it takes me.

Sadly, non-WH data/relic sites are pretty rare in wormholes, but you can always take one that takes you into nullsec and have a go at them over there."
Xcom,ff1yrzw,t1_ff1ln5e,1579489298.0,"Generally yeah, those 2 tend to be finishers. I once had the stars align for a grenadier to get Death From Above. She'd sit on top of a building, toss a grenade onto a pack of enemies to kill their cover, their armour and hurt (which only cost 1 action due to grenadier skill), then open up with her cannon and hose them all down one at a time."
cats,feutoa1,t3_eqh892,1579389778.0,"Wrong, he jumped in and expects YOU to get him out. He can definitely get out if he wants to on his own, but he's mewling for his servant to do it for him."
Oxygennotincluded,fep895k,t1_feof44c,1579314356.0,"Actually, slushies on average have a slightly lower output rate compared to cool steam vents. They nerfed them a while ago, because they were just too good. ( They're still bloody awesome )"

Proof that cats can fly. On a similar note, as a kid, I was once at the place of some friends of my parents, who had a cat which was older than me at the time ( she was 23 years old ). She loved to go outside, and on that day, I saw her under some bushes in the garden looking up intently, I looked to where she was looking and there was a small bird in a tree, then when the bird jumped and flew across the garden, she darted out, jumped 10 feet into the air and grabbed it mid air. I was completely stunned."

spaceengineers,fd3s9dn,t1_fd357az,1578161248.0,"That's what control consoles are for. Add a couple of cameras where you need to look, and you can remotely operate a lot of things. Possibly with a crew of more than 1 person."
spaceengineers,fd31pla,t3_ejxd94,1578153876.0,"I think I'd rather have those buttons somewhere inside the ship, so I don't have to walk the walk of death every time I take out the garbage."

Oxygennotincluded,fcw49x5,t3_ej6g86,1578016806.0,"Not too shabby, little bit of advice, leave 1 space open between your sinks and also between your lavatories, so when you have developed statures, you can put one in between each sink and each lavatory to up the decor there. Another good decor boost is to put 2 2x2 and 4 2x3 pictures in your barracks for decor boost during sleeping hours.
When you find one, replace that bluff briar in your great hall with a buddy bud, that way, everyone will get exposed to flower scents during mealtime.
( you can also put one in the bathrooms or showers when/if you build those )"
XCOM2,fcnvuzz,t1_fcnudel,1577819464.0,Think of DLC as expansions ( just a bit small for a proper expansion ).
spaceengineers,fclmyq9,t3_ehtr8u,1577751582.0,"The right one definitely.. for extra flavor, add some warheads on the sides of that road through the middle and a spiky rotating blade like tunnel followed by a reactor inside a 3 axis gyroscope, with some kind of script running the revolutions, so every time all three circles align, lights flash on for a second. Oh and of course the front side of the ship should have it's own thrusters so it can be used as an escape craft. ( this section should also house medical bay )"
spaceengineers,fclmpqa,t1_fclkx7y,1577751413.0,Looks like he used a mod of some kind in combination with blast doors.

spaceengineers,fcl3vvf,t3_ehnqwz,1577739242.0,"If you got experimental mode on, use 'share tensor strength' on the pistons, that will reduce/eliminate the klanging.

I had a similar problem with an umbilical piston that would come up from the shaft of my underground base so i could unload stuff without having to land underground. Without that checkbox on, once I connected my ship to the umbilical, it would start shaking like mad."
cats,fcf44bo,t1_fcejgn6,1577626428.0,Still Worth it.
