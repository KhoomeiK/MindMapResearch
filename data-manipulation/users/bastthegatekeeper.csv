bipolar,ff8ydr1,t3_esbxsn,1579700029.0,"I've been medicated for the last 2.5 years after a long struggle of getting bad side effects and refusing to take medications. 

I made it through law school without medications, took the bar exam and passed.  Now I'm a lawyer working as a public defender.

 With my medication I still get slight highs/lows but they're manageable.  I have a successful career and I'm very open about being bipolar to try and reduce the stigma. I'm very glad I finally sat down and found a drug that works for me."
