I was in the second year of a 3-year IT-course when this happened. It was me and a few friends of mine. We were in a networking lesson and everyone in class had their own individual Linux computer with different passwords taped to them. We coded on linux terminal. We coded a script that opened up any website in any amount.

As the 15 minute break came around, the teacher went out for some coffee and the other students did their own thing.

And shortly after they left, one of my friends left the computer logged on as he left to use the bathroom and the rest of us we started that script and typed in 'pornhub.com 10' or something like that and 10 tabs of pornhub opened up."

AskReddit,ffg51m1,t3_esps5n,1579898611.0,"I have a few, but this one terrifies me the most. 

The thing that terrifies me is that one late night when you're going to the bathroom, you see your own reflection in the mirror staring at you like a psychopath, with a big, unnatural ear-to-ear smile. Knowing fully well that you're not smiling at all.
And the eyes are as dark as charcoal.

Edit: This gives me chills throughout my whole body as I'm writing this, so I should stop now.

Edit 2: I know, this sounds silly, but it's actually somewhat a real thing."
