Well, Abe does regularly honor Japanese perpetrators of massive crimes against humanity --in his official capacity."
todayilearned,fcrg8as,t1_fcrei1s,1577901413.0,"You may think it's funny but would you lightly say the same about Hitler's protege if he was Germany's current prime minister? And yes, Abe still visits the Yasukuni Shrine to honors Japanese war criminals, ardently denies Japanese shameful and massive crimes against humanity and yes, Abe's own grandfather was a militant war criminal. Would you really flippantly say the same about Hitler's protege?"

relationships,fc502uc,t3_eg6p9w,1577436195.0,"It's also possible that your bf is conflicted because of his traditional parents' strong influence aka the final say. So he may feel serious about you but before he further invests himself into your relationship (after all, the two of you did introduce each other to both sides), this testing of his folks can be his own immature but sincere way to find out whether it's worth moving forward with you before it gets too serious. Just a thought"

relationships,fbzvjvw,t3_ef6b09,1577263883.0,"This repeats many comments here but here's the gist: accept that you and your gf can't do anything about her ""friend's"" behavior.  BUT your gf can do what's within her control -- cutting this guy off for good -- but both she and you appear to be making excuses for her not taking action within her control (e.g. gf is stressed, trying to quit smoking, etc.)   This sounds more like a gf-problem rather than her ""friend's"" problem.  Maybe best to reevaluate your relationship.  Boundaries are willingly crossed here."
