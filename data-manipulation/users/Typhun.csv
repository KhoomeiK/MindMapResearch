Taken from Berman's wikipedia page:

\> In August 2018, U.S. Representative Chris Collins, his son Cameron, and the father of Cameron’s fiancée, Stephen Zarsky, were arrested by the FBI and charged with insider trading and making false statements by Berman. Following the charges, House Speaker Paul Ryan kicked Collins off of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Collins suspended his reelection campaign.

Collins is a Republican and one of the first to endorse Trump.

\> In January 2019, Berman charged Natalya Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, with obstruction of justice in connection with a false and misleading declaration she submitted to a judge in the Southern District of New York. Berman said on announcing the indictment: “Fabricating evidence to affect the outcome of pending litigation not only undermines the integrity of the judicial process, but it threatens the ability of our courts and our government to ensure that justice is done.” 

You may remember her as the Russian lawyer that Trump Jr met with in Trump Tower to talk about ""that adoption stuff.""
