I moved in at 33, as we were still in touch, I wasn't happy where I was living, and knew he had a empty big ass house. He agreed and I've been here 3 years. Ive been back in school for the last 1.5 years and will graduate in December. No idea for plans yet, but completely open to relocating.



Okay so me and roommate get along for the most part, never bicker, but sometimes don't really talk much. Like what's up man or what're you doing and that's about it. Then occasionally we'll talk for hours, but not often or anything. Oh and also he has a herniated disk and refuses to get health insurance or a disability lawyer, bc he's not very bright. His daddy has always handed him everything. So he didn't work 2 years straight, with my rent being his income (his dad pays mortgage+every single bill). Originally I was sending his dad the money then they had a big fight and then I started giving it to him n. Idc rent is rent. He finally got a job as a POS salesman doing B2B sales, and it's been bleak... like he's on his 3rd company and isn't making any money, it's commission only. 



Okay so he's started seeing this girl who lives 2 hours away he met online. She's cool. He's gone there but usually she comes here. She has 3 boys (neither of us have kids). Her 2 oldest are teens and dads gets them like every other weekend when she comes. The 3rd is 9 and has... sorry, I think it's Multiple sclerosis. In a wheelchair, can't talk words, plays fortnite all day and is pretty chill. Gets excited and squeals and stuff though. My roommate it horrible about it and yells at him like a dog. It's like he thinks bc he's like that it's okay. Little dude waves me down when I see him and gets me to play a game or 2 with him, gets so excited and happy.. and roommate will yell at him to shut up even when im playing with him and in the other room. 



Okay so me and her were talking the other day. She said hes trying to get her and her 3 kids to move in immediately, but she said no way before school year ends.. and that she doesn't know bc it's only been like 2 months and he's not good with kids. Either way idc, wanna move out but not necessarily immediately, like a month or 2. Ive already paid feb as he asks for rent earlier and earlier as its his only income plus he's got a chick and apparently 3 kids now. Not my problem. 



My parents are getting old, they just sold my grandmas old house for a lot more then they expected (not best part of town). They still live in the 3 story, 5 bedroom house were grew up in. My dr. Older sister bought a house up the street and we get along great. My little brother ODd Aug 2018 at 30 and my mom has been obv sad since. Like I said, I graduate in December. No plans yet but wide open. Talked to them today, pitched the idea of moving in till I graduate, and they offered to help me finance a new car in the meantime (not new.. but go from my 2010 impala to like a 2016 Silverado), me trade in + pay them what I was paying in rent+bills (about 850. I bartend and make good money. School is online so no conflicts. ). Anyways so I know roommate wants to move a family in, but he doesn't know I know as he hasn't mentioned anything as he wouldn't until last second to A) avoid it and B) keep getting $$. Almost all the furniture/ electronics/ even washer and dryer are mine. The house was literally empty besides an old couch, coffee table, and his bed. So I know it's going to hurt him financially big time, as he'll have to replace that stuff living with a family of 5 and all.. how do I make this less awkward? He's known to get petty about shit.. like one time out of blue he was like ""great, gonna have to replace your carpet whenever you move out"". His cat has literally ripped apart the carpet in every room in the house but mine. Plus mine was still prob the cleanest. I was like ""I'll def steam clean it"" and he said no good. Bitch the entire houses carpet needs replacing. I know he'll be petty about that shit, especially the furniture and washer/ dryer... as it will just be in storage.. but it's mine, I brought it with me, give me $1000 cash or sorry. I just can't even imagine what ge might try to bring up. But on the bright side im a gun nut and have 4 and he's scared to death of even being near them... plus the handicapped part so I don't think he could even physically hurt me if he tried. He's okay as a friend but if he gets pissy got no probs moving on from him.. especially with 3 kids lol."

atheism,ff8bfdz,t3_ery1ay,1579671813.0,"I was really into church as a youth.  We're had a real ""out there"" preacher for a couple of years (for the time) i was like 15-17, '99-01.  He encouraged questions and if he ever got stumped he'd put in weeks if research trying to find out, but had an answer for about everything.  Or would be honest and say I don't know.   We were Presbyterian, who believe in predestination.  I asked him how he can believe an ""all loving"" God could decide whos getting in and whos going to hell before even living their lives.   His answer is that yes he believes in predestination, and that everyone is predestined for salvation.  Nothing you could ever do would stop God from loving you and sending you to eternal suffering.  He also said you should still spend your time on earth trying to be the best you that you can be regardless, and that he could be wrong in his theory, but he believes it with conviction.  Hearing my preacher tell me this really changed my perspective on everything having to be so black and white with the church.   

Unfortunately the same preacher was let go in 01 after a sermon about how safe sex before marriage is a much better option than saving yourself, getting  married way early at 19 so you can do the deed, and it not working out .

[AR](https://imgur.com/a/N6b12GX) in case, upstairs.. have loaded mags ready but they dont fit loaded in the case (maybe they do..idk) but never see any reason to keep it loaded.  Or have it really.  It's just fun all pimped out.  Then finally my trusty [Glock 19](https://imgur.com/a/allvutI) that splits time between my car, person, and collecting dust next to the 1911 on the dresser.  I don't need 3, a single handgun could serve nearly all my necessities, but damn if they're not fun to shoot. But they're not fucking toys and anyone exposed to them should know they're very deadly, and could be just by touching them.   Glad I don't have kids, I own a safe but my guns are too pretty to be thrown in the corner of my closet.   I love looking at them, cleaning/ oiling, taking apart, modding, etc.  They're just.. awesome.   Better than kids anyways.

Got a way better case for the AR since the pic.."

rolltide,fdmhm7j,t1_fdmgwry,1578550200.0,"While im at it, wanted to share a story from 2009.  I used to bartend so knew a lot of the players who went out.   Not well, but I knew them and they knew me.   After the LSU game, I was out at galettes, the girl I was talking to was working the beer cart out front.   In walks about 10 football players, being mobbed of course as we'd just beaten LSU.  Greg McElroy walked up to get a beer, I offered to buy it and a shot, he accepted.  I was originally supposed to go to the game with my dad, but he'd recently had a stroke and was at home obviously not able to go.   After the shot and talking for a couple minutes, I asked Greg if he'd do me the biggest favor.  I explained about my dad's and that he's the biggest fan ever and was really bummed he couldn't go.  I asked Greg if I could call him and him say hello to him.   He said 'absolutely' and i dialed my old man.   He answered, told him there's somebody I'd like him to talk to and hand Greg the phone.   Greg proceeds to talk to my dad for over 10 minutes, recusing himself to the corner of the patio where he could hear better.   And all this while his teammates were being rowdy and having fun, and people were just mobbing them and everyone was loving it.   But Greg just sat there, chatting away with my dad.   My dad's face still lights up when Greg is mentioned or on TV.  Dude went well beyond anything ever expected of him to make my old man's day.  I can never thank him enough for doing that for him.   A true saint of a person."

Dude was making millions, but had made a promise to his mom that her would get his degree.   We had to meet about once a week with our group for projects.   After meeting once in the library, after that Roman had us over to his apartment, which was fun as hell.   Played madden with him and went out to the bars often.   Dude is a GQ looking millionaire, but was the most humble, down to earth guy I've ever met.   Hope he's doing well since retiring.   Never wanted to see a dude seceded more than him."
