memes,ffnmcml,t1_ffmc04n,1580067810.0,I take it as someone who--when they see a message and has the time to reply to it--actually replies to it instead of leaving it to simmer because they think it comes off as desperate or some other childish reason. It's a bit too common.
Damnthatsinteresting,ffnglgk,t3_eu8rt7,1580065683.0,"It isn't too terrible to hold a dog by the scruff for a short amount of time if done properly. My issue is the dude's weird ass smile as he shows the dog off like he's Rafiki presenting Simba to the world. It's s fuckin' puppy, act like you've seen one before. His face irritates me. Way more than it should. What the hell."
Music,ffjxlpo,t1_ffj4rs9,1580009742.0,"Yeah, it's Jaskier's songs that sound odd mostly, especially Toss a Coin... The instrumentals are far too loud and overpower his voice. And the vocals are almost good, just sound like they were recorded in some sort of bathroom."
unpopularopinion,ffh2tw2,t3_etixlq,1579921597.0,"While analog clocks may be in many buildings, people have technology in their pockets. Instead of searching for the time, they can pull out their phone/look at their apple watch or whatever and check. Do that for long enough and you might become a little rusty at reading an analog. Looking at a circle with two lines for time makes you no smarter than a person looking at a phone with numbers for time. Silly thing to be irritated about."

If she's going to feed them and treat them as a pet, then she should take them in, neuter and spay them, and then keep them inside so they aren't a nuisance to others. Otherwise she's just half assing the responsibility."

Others are posting about their pregnancies and due dates, relating to the image. And they are currently being terribly downvoted for this. Both are quality images that stamp a period in time, the only difference is the positive emotions they elicit."
pics,fbzl55j,t3_ef7e61,1577250394.0,"Six months ago this subreddit upvoted an image (one of the top upvoted images this year) of a father relaxing while he watches his son mow the lawn. [https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c3sjf3/been\_looking\_forward\_to\_this\_day\_for\_8\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/c3sjf3/been_looking_forward_to_this_day_for_8_years/)

The same subreddit throws a hissy fit over a father's happiness over his beautiful wife as she's about to bring new life into the world.

""We don't know her so we don't care,"" ""leave this on Facebook,"" ""this picture provides no value to the sub."" I find both images charming. Pregnancy is beautiful, as is watching your son do your chores. Not everything needs to be Tiananmen Square here."
