funny,ffe57t9,t1_ffe2emj,1579837014.0,I don't know I feel like a public lashing like this is a bit worse since she's putting a name out there so others can shame her. At least with her husband the only shame comes from the wife unless there's a part 2 to this and he gets a bigger sign and public lashing.

That’s my take not that I would care if he reacted that way it’s his choice to not be a fan of what was being said and I think people assuming everyone had to agree or their a pedophile are being a tad bit myopic."
entertainment,feeuucc,t1_feeul4m,1579041700.0,"That’s not really what the convos about in most of these threads. Most of the convo is about how Hollywood doesn’t dictate policy as much as Wall Street and Politicians do at least hands on and it’s true. The reply I made was more so a response to people assuming everyone in Hollywood is an idiot. As for who you trust with your money that’s whatever it is, but the people who do end up producing movies even during a loss end up making their money one way or another but then again most producers and movie investors usually have already had experience in the industry."
LosAngeles,feeudcq,t1_feen4n8,1579041409.0,I mean I’m basing this off a deal my friend is selling right now. He has a developer who’s a buyer who just wants a house to flip.

entertainment,feeu605,t1_feet8ty,1579041281.0,None anymore but they did and there are still men with power in Hollywood who aren’t idiots.

povertyfinance,fcj0wk0,t1_fcj0hoa,1577674522.0,"That happened with me and BofA so I don’t use them. My current bank Ally apparently has it in fine print that ACH payments do take 3 days UNTIL you’ve been a customer for awhile then it changes to 24 hours but they don’t tell you they’re doing this and what got me is they’d process these ACH payments 10 Damn minutes before my Direct Deposit cleared. So now I don’t schedule anything for the day my deposit hits instead I wait an extra day which works, but for fucks sake they got me good with that one. And sure they can say it’s your fault, but in retrospect banks are purposely obtuse about transparency and it’s most likely to increase the fees they intake. However my overdrafts never got that high so I’m thankful for that, but damn I would die if I saw a 300 dollar overdraft."
povertyfinance,fcizslh,t1_fcizp6c,1577673752.0,It was Ally but most people like Ally bank compared to other big banks. It does have less fees but jeezus they will screw you if you aren’t paying close attention with overdraft fees.

povertyfinance,fchzkbv,t1_fchtlv8,1577655990.0,"I honestly think some banks are still doing this or a form of it. This is what I was talking about up in an earlier thread, but not necessarily reordering just processing ach payments faster when they realize your account is below a certain limit. I had Ally literally change processing time for AcH from 3 days to 24 hours and then they kept processing these literally minutes before my direct deposit went through. Super shady, obviously I just changed my ach payments now so it doesn’t happen, but that’s shit happened to me 3 times in 2 weeks while changing accounts around I’m still annoyed tbh."
povertyfinance,fchyyjm,t1_fchwlo6,1577655771.0,That’s odd because almost everyone I know has had an issue with BofA and their fee structure.
povertyfinance,fchysbi,t1_fchbu86,1577655709.0,There’s actually quite a few lawsuits looking into how banks process overdraft fees. They’re definitely doing some shady shit. I mean for mine I know the day my payments process but sometimes things get pushed through faster for no reason and I’m  not talking about a weekend hold I mean they randomly will change pay days by 2 days then I check the account it was paying and it’s still set for the same date it’s always been. So my guess is these payment processors send off payments which aren’t supposed to clear for a day or two but sometimes the banks let them clear faster and I swear it’s to maximize fees but the issue is unless your working on the algorithm for the banks you really can’t prove otherwise. I’m just suspect after checking payments over the course of 12 months. Keep in mind this is probably me going into conspiracy territory.
