Thanks for responding, I really appreciate it.

I am doing all the things that you have suggested, AA is not for me, I've tried and it's just not my thing.  I have been talking to mental health professionals and have finally found a therapist to take me on long term.  Our first session is Thursday and I'm really looking forward to it."

BreakUps,fdhwrpb,t3_ekuw9z,1578431556.0,I also needed this post. I was dumped a week before Christmas and we are still living together.  It's very awkward but it's what she wants.  I don't blame her for breaking up with me as I became mentally ill and an alcoholic and it took too much of a toll on both of us.  She says she still loves me and cares and supports me but needs me to move out and work on myself.  I agree with her and have been in denial thinking I could start changing while living here and she'd see.  I've done so much damage to the relationship and I feel so bad.  I'll be moving out as soon as I can gather enough money together and find a place.  Also I havnt had a drink in 19 days and I am determined to straighten myself out regardless of my current situation.
