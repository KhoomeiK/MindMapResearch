Advice,ffy023q,t1_ffy002e,1580335843.0,Kk
Advice,ffxys2u,t1_ffxyqzp,1580335081.0,Why
Advice,ffxya8e,t1_ffxy83u,1580334798.0,I think because I'm a student it's a bit different.
Advice,ffxy6m1,t1_ffxy0ck,1580334739.0,I'm still in highschool. I know it says college I'm going both.
Advice,ffxxglr,t1_ffxxdxo,1580334330.0,Yeah thanks
Advice,ffxx3v1,t1_ffxwy51,1580334135.0,"She treats my brother differently. She would probably let him live here indefinitely without rent or anything.

And yeah not relying on them is the goal"
Advice,ffxwr40,t1_ffxwnk0,1580333940.0,"The goal is to be independent!

Yeah I suppose I should play nice although I don't see it as fair or appropriate."
Advice,ffxwmtm,t1_ffxw99q,1580333875.0,That's my thought too
Advice,ffxwm2x,t1_ffxwb40,1580333863.0,"Yeah as soon as I start making money I'm taking her off of my bank account. She's irresponsible with money and I have things I want to do.

I was thinking I could just buy her a gas card. That way I know my money is going to where she ""wants"" it to go to.

I'm still in highschool so I think asking me for rent would be a bit wrong. Just because I'm 18 doesn't mean her job is over. Also my brother is older and doesn't work and they seem to have little issue about that.

I will definitely save up to leave. I don't wanna deal with this longer than I have to. Thanks for your time!"
Advice,ffxw4uw,t1_ffxw3r9,1580333588.0,Yeah already thought of that
AmItheAsshole,fftl3y5,t3_ev4mbb,1580223340.0,They should know more about the place they traveled to.
wemetonline,ffs3y7a,t3_euptg1,1580172536.0,Don't ghost
LongDistance,ffqelsu,t1_ffplatc,1580132276.0,That's super cute
AskReddit,ffmhy66,t3_eu6iol,1580054926.0,"Okay not quite this so sorry about that but lately when I go to google images I get weird fucking buy this ads. Yesterday I looked up superior chocolate ( a chocolate I had in Ecuador) then a picture of mens uder wear with a hotdog in the crock pops up. I didn't see the chocolate in the images either so I added Ecuador and found it. Then I wanted to show my parents the weird shop thing and IT CHANGED! It changed to a magnum condom sweatshirt.

This is not the only time something like this has happened either."
AskReddit,ffmhe10,t1_ffmffa3,1580054693.0,Good point! Maybe it has to do with the motherly aspects of being a female. Gotta make sure you're getting what's best for your kids? And gotta be the best?
AskReddit,ffmdmbg,t1_ffmdcyo,1580052995.0,"This was perfectly said thank you for taking this time. Society definitely has a huge role in it. Women have been so overly competitve it seems to almost be a part of our nature.

Friendships with males seem so much easier. They're not nearly as competitive. The competition honestly gets so tiring."
AskReddit,ffmdcol,t3_eu7xl3,1580052829.0,Probably the same because it's every moment
