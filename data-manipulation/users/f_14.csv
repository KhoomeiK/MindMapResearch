HomeNetworking,ff4juxp,t1_ff4j03u,1579565364.0,"I wouldn’t do a 50 foot run coupled with another 50 foot run. That wouldn’t be good, but having a six inch patch cable between your switch and patch panel isn’t going to hurt anything, which is what a lot of people are going on about. Personally I wouldn’t want to do a 50 foot slim run at all. I’d go for a much heavier gauge for something like that."
HomeNetworking,ff3vbaz,t1_ff3v489,1579549636.0,The entire article is about using it with poe.
HomeNetworking,ff3pymh,t1_ff3k2em,1579546341.0,"Yeah, the access points are what you really need. The controller can run off a computer or nas if they’re always on. It’s definitely a luxury to have the udm. It’s a lot cheaper from the ubiquiti online store though."
HomeNetworking,ff39a9g,t3_erexih,1579536707.0,"I have a similar setup. I got a Ubiquiti UDM and a poe switch. The UDM has a built-in across point, which is centrally located near the ceiling in my basement. I have good coverage throughout my house with just this. However, since you have Ethernet to your rooms, you can have additional access points connected via Ethernet to broaden your network. You can do a second access point upstairs easily and that will probably work well. They have a few different options for this depending on if you want additional Ethernet ports in the AP or not. Management is pretty easy."
desmoines,ff303en,t1_ff2xnsm,1579530044.0,"Welcome to Iowa! Amazon is going to be hiring a ton of people for their distribution centers in the next couple months, so that’s an option. Consider going to DMACC, the community college, for something like welding if that interests you. I’ve been told there are lots of openings for that kind of work."
Ubiquiti,ff2tuou,t1_ff297hy,1579523931.0,"It’s because they’re working for people. Electrical resistance is a function of length, so you don’t need super thick wires with shielding to go six inches."

Ubiquiti,fek3n30,t1_fek2pmk,1579191912.0,"Yeah that’s expensive for a camera, but a reolink camera is less than half the cost of a ubiquiti one. The doorbell option seems like a definite advantage for UniFi when it becomes available though. I’ve been trying to decide what system to go with. Might do qnap though, as it comes with 8 camera licenses I believe, and I already have one."
Ubiquiti,fek2ijb,t3_epkfqw,1579191227.0,Curious how the UniFi protect compares to the synology surveillance station. Synology seems to be a lot more cost effective if you already have the nas.
desmoines,fef4ajm,t1_feemzcp,1579047843.0,"I’ve had them for a year. Service has been pretty rock solid and I get the advertised speeds. I did have issues with their router/modem combo having to be reset occasionally, and that got annoying. They answer the phone (like a real live person) and are pretty quick to service the problem at no charge. Never been charged anything other than the base rate except for the one time equipment charge on setup. So I’m extremely happy with them."
desmoines,fef3sen,t1_feel5oj,1579047500.0,"Running 200 mbps down, 200 mbps up fiber right now in Waukee for $69.99/mo. I’m getting roughly 180 mbps every time I run a speed test, so it’s working too. Incidentally, Mediacom sends me advertisements for service just about as fast down and for similar prices now too. So competition works."
Ubiquiti,fee5mdu,t3_eonie2,1579026885.0,Synology or QNAP NAS with ip cameras is an option.
desmoines,fee04xy,t3_eolxvj,1579023560.0,"The auditorium there is pretty small to begin with. Couple that with the huge stage and production, along with the media in attendance, there are probably only a few seats anyway."

DataHoarder,feb06dr,t1_feart1p,1578954099.0,"I wasn’t aware of the deep storage option. That’s closer to what I had envisioned. Pricing isn’t bad, but it costs a bunch to get your data back, right?"
DataHoarder,feaeb78,t1_feabbbj,1578947597.0,"Yeah, there would obviously have to be a level of trust involved, and that might be a hurdle too high. I know some tape solutions are network accessible, so maybe for it to work the client would have a limited window of online access for a data check. That introduces a whole level of complexity though."
DataHoarder,feadyi3,t1_feabpjv,1578947432.0,"Yeah, it would definitely be a billable service for videographers. On the photo side that’s not really going to happen realistically. But there are photographers like myself that have backups, but would see a value in something archival. I agree with you though, I want no part of having a way to know what’s on the media. That’s too much liability."
DataHoarder,feaa0ab,t1_fea93fg,1578946128.0,"Yeah, security would obviously be a major issue. It would be optimal to have encrypted volumes sent around, as there’s not a good way I can think of to handle it otherwise. That said, some people- photographers, videographers, etc. - could have data they want stored for safe keeping that doesn’t need super secure encryption."
Ubiquiti,fe2f0nz,t3_eneq7l,1578837674.0,"Sonos might be an issue for you if you’re wanting to isolate that on another vlan. I haven’t figured out how to make that work without an igmp proxy, which the udm doesn’t support. So mine just live in my main network."
qnap,fdscz2s,t1_fds8676,1578699800.0,"Realistically your catalog isn’t that large. You can have your photos on the nas, but keep the metadata file on your local machine. They do it this way to prevent multiple computers from accessing the catalog at the same time."

sonos,fds1wdf,t1_fds0l7n,1578693044.0,"Audio delay. I have an LG C8 oled, and like a lot of people I have audio sync issues with a Beam and surrounds. There is a setting that allows for pass-through audio, which solves the problem for most things, but not all. With the fire tv stick, the big apps like Netflix, HBO, Disney all sync perfectly. YouTube and PBS on the other hand have a noticeable delay. There isn’t a solution other than turning off Dolby and going stereo only (not happening), or like OP did and splitting out video and audio before it hits the tv. Personally, I can deal with it for the effected apps so I can have surround and one remote controlling everything. It’s annoying though."

This article consists of: 

- It was damaged 18 months ago. 

- The insurance company is contesting the claim (the only news but zero information about it or if that’s unusual)

- A brief description of the place

- One quote from their marketing team saying it’s been hard and that a lot of people saw movies there. Well duh. 

I’m surprised they didn’t call it an “investigation”"
desmoines,fdq7gc1,t3_emdunj,1578658083.0,"The center needed to decide whether to invest in a digital projector system, which would cost a lot in addition to the repairs. After the IMAX opened in waukee it may not have made a lot of sense to spend that much."

todayilearned,fdkserp,t3_elurq0,1578510179.0,"We went to see Bob Dylan a couple months ago and there was a woman sitting in the front row, center stage, who had some sort of palsy or something. She was dancing like a champ at everything, and it was incredible watching her and the band reacting to her. She looked so happy, pumping her fists in the air and pretty much unable to sit for more than a minute. I don’t know what the band thought at first, but you could tell that they figured it out really quickly and pretty much spent the rest of the show playing for her. It looked like Bob and the band were having a lot of fun. It made for the best Dylan show I’ve ever seen."

HomeNetworking,fda1xfb,t1_fd9l3a0,1578240768.0,"Yeah, it’s 4-5 years old I hear. I’m no expert. But basically everyone says it’s outdated and can’t handle deep packet inspection. There’s no replacement on the horizon though. I understand the anxiety over an all in one, but by the time you get a cloud key and usg you’re almost at the cost of the udm, and that’s before the AP. If you really think you’re going to do cameras, then waiting for the udmp is probably smart. And you don’t have to worry about the all in one. But $$$"

gadgets,fcul5o1,t1_fcuir60,1577983420.0," Video will definitely tax a system, but I think you might try a different hub if you’re having that many issues. I know the hubs I have with sd card readers are a lot slower than a Sandisk usb c sd reader. That said, I can run a monitor and tether a camera and have other devices attached with mine no problem. It’s just not as fast when dumping hundreds of stills from a sd reader to another drive."

One thing that took a while to realize is that Apple changed their security on MacBooks, so that a usb device plugged in while the computer is closed won’t be recognized. It’s done so a malicious device can’t access your system if it’s not logged in. Consequently, you have to have the laptop open and logged in before you plug in a device."

The udm is near the ceiling in my basement at the center of my home, and I’m getting good coverage everywhere except the far corners of my upstairs bedrooms. Even those spots are getting 30mbs, so it’s not bad. As for WiFi 6, I thought that was going to help areas with lots of clients. So not really that useful for a home application."
