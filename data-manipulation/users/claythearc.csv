JustBootThings,ffck13r,t1_ffcj868,1579801108.0,"Depends on your definition of cloak, and from what. You could use prisms, in theory, to scatter radar out and make it not reflected. Or even to change the cross section to something that doesnâ€™t look like a giant freedom boat. 

Those probably arenâ€™t what heâ€™s going for, and we also probably have much more elegant ways of doing it, but itâ€™s possible I guess."

My actual pay is like ~70K pre tax. But then thereâ€™s a ton of other benefits I have on top of that, like a 15-20% SEP contribution that I just get without having to contribute any money, all insurance & deductibles paid for during the year, etc. that makes up the other ~30.

I graduated with a mediocre gpa like yourself (low 2s). While I didnâ€™t have trouble finding a job, accepted an offer like 2 days after graduation for ~$100k in a super low COL area, I can relate to the struggle you posted. 

Itâ€™s important to share for others, because it seems like everyone is so focused on needing to goto the #1 CS school, to get a 4.0, to work at google to be successful, and thatâ€™s just not how it works for everyone. There are a billion paths to success"

The first stage, is that the house votes on an article of impeachment. This is basically like charges against you.

Once those charges are voted on, youâ€™re impeached. Meaning youâ€™ve been accused of wrong doing. 

Then, it moves to the senate for an actual guilty / not guilty verdict which is where youâ€™d go from formally impeached to removed from office."
