AskVegans,fefhi1q,t3_eouezc,1579056430.0,"Vegetarians follow a diet that exclude meat from their diet but still consumer all other animals products.

Then there is a plant based diet which consists of avoiding meat as well as excluding all other animals products from one's diet. Reasons for this typically include health and the environment.

Vegans follow a plant based diet and additionally avoid use of all animal products in clothing, furniture, cosmetics, health products, etc. Vegans do this exclusively for the reason of animal welfare.

Non-vegan's are typically referred to as omnis (omnivores) by vegans, though occasionally you'll see someone say carnivore, though, from my experience this is mostly coming from people who take pride in consuming meat.

James Wilkes' definition is technically correct, though from my experience ""plant based"" has been used more often in the sense of ""plant only"". Perhaps that definition is changing overtime to allow me flexibility in dietary preference."

AskVegans,fdme9lm,t3_em34fi,1578547064.0,"From a utilitarian standpoint, if you consume animal products offered to you, you're still contributing to the demand for that product. For example, if a friend offered you steak for dinner, and you said no, that friend would later eat that steak anyway and wait a little longer to buy his next groceries. If you accept the steak, he'll run out of steak sooner and buy more of it sooner.

From a moral standpoint, eating animal products only when offered doesn't negate that you eat plant based the rest of the time. At the end of the day though, you're compromising your moral viewpoint of not contributing to animal abuse; you have to be able to reconcile your moral and ethical beliefs.

From a more sociological standpoint, accepting animal products that are offered to you perpetuates the idea that plant based meals are not the norm. You'd be promoting plant based meals as normal if you asked to be accommodated.

As a final thought, between letting people walk all over you and being aggressive, there is space for being assertive.

As for the groceries argument, you're right. I get a significant part of my groceries from misfits market, which doesn't sell animal products.

As for the advocacy thing, keep in mind that [self reported data](https://www.verywellmind.com/definition-of-self-report-425267) can't always be taken at face value.

After your first quote, the Vegan Society guide continues to talk about the effectiveness of educating people on how to become vegan (rather than only why) as a way to overcome the perceived inconvenience of becoming vegan. 

""Focusing on how to make changes has proved effective in experimental studies, too: Humane League Labs (2014a) found that people who received a pro-vegetarian booklet focused on how to go vegetarian reported diet changes that spared 50% more animals than those who received a booklet focused on why to go vegetarian. Allen and Witte (2000) find some supporting evidence in fear-based appeals: when people perceive they have an ability to mitigate a threat, they are most likely to change their behaviour, whereas when they perceive a lack of ability to mitigate the threat, they most likely have a defensive response.""

So the important takeaway here, for me at least, is that people need to be convinced that they have the ability to mitigate the threat, in other words, be familiar enough with veganism that they're comfortable switching over. My guess is that plant based meats from fast food chains don't cover all the bases for most people to feel they know enough about veganism to switch over. Though unfortunately I know some folks out there probably do live on just fast food 😂

As for the amount of consumption of these plant based alternatives by omnivores compared to vegans, it's probably fair to withhold judgement on that until more data is available, given that the NPD research group and the Burger King CEO have made contradictory statements."

Companies like KFC, Burger King, McDonalds, etc. have demonstrated they don't care for animals and will only do what makes them more money. 

Besides, the Burger King CEO has stated there has been no decline in meat product sales since they started selling the Impossible Burger so that burger is only creating additional profit for them, not saving any animals from abuse and murder.

Is it the end of the world? Probably not, but there are much more ethical alternatives to the plant-based meats these companies are trying to sell."

AskVegans,fcirh3y,t3_ehbg2e,1577668073.0,"I enjoy the taste of almond milk more than soy milk and drank that for years until I found out that oatmilk may be better for the environment (less water use). I'll only have tofu once or twice a month and I also use liquid aminos instead of soy sauce. In all, cutting out all soy products wouldn't be a significant change from my current diet.

I do use vegan butter a couple of times a week for cooking. The one I use has soy in it but I've seen vegan butter without soy as well."

AskVegans,fcfertw,t1_fcdv9o4,1577629209.0,"Lmao get outta here you troll. What kinda person asks a question, then criticizes all the answers (even the jokes) and then ends up not knowing what they're talking about.

Potato is low on the amount of protein it has but the protein itself is high quality.

Guess I shouldn't be surprised that the beef industry will try and spin beef production so that people keep buying beef."
AskVegans,fc7ox59,t3_egia47,1577514707.0,"As far as approaching your family goes, just kill em with kindness. Lots of people are afraid to deviate from the norm so they'll dismiss veganism right away. If you can show people you're happy and healthy and set a tone with them that is inviting, most people will accept your lifestyle and they may become more open to it themselves. 

Depending on your family/friends, you may want to shove it in their face when you've been successfully vegan for some time. Stay humble lol. Starting a non-productive argument that discourages meat eaters from considering veganism only hurts animals in the long run.

There are a few dozen subreddits related to veganism. Check them out and stay engaged in those for both practical and moral support. Some personal favorites:

Kudos for having the insight and courage to start becoming vegan and good luck with your journey towards a more empathetic world!"

vegetarian,fc6l7aj,t3_efvor2,1577483199.0,"Start with a few easy meals and build on those. Stir frying frozen veggies is easy and you can change the sauce, rice, noodles, etc. for some variety. 

Also, look at r/PlantBasedDiet and r/VeganFoodPorn

Going vegetarian is great, but it's not a 100% plant based diet as vegetarians still consumer dairy, egg, and other animal products. 

Either way, best of luck on your journey!"

Seattle,fc09dsp,t1_fbzu8z0,1577283871.0,"True but there are lots of different people who can prescribe. Psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychiatrists, primary care doctors, physicians assistants, even a few psychologists can prescribe. Within these, there are individuals with different levels of experience and competency. It's better to evaluate the individual provider on their ability to help than judge each provider by only their credentials."
Seattle,fc08vg4,t3_efcpf3,1577283340.0,"I used to work in a mental health clinic. When our wait to see the psychiatrist was too long, we'd regularly refer patients to primary care. They're obviously not as specialized and may be more cautious with a new patient, but if you have been taking Wellbutrin for at least a few months without any issues and you're not requesting a dose change, they'll be more inclined to renew the prescription. Also, while maybe not necessary,  a note from your previous prescriber that summarizes your treatment may help the doctor feel more comfortable writing you a prescription."
