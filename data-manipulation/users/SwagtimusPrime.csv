b) generally speaking, the more layers of defense the better, but ofc the more layers the more difficult to gear the more expensive. energy shield should only be a priority if you are doing a Low Life build or CI, armour is usually neglected when you play a dodge based character using acrobatics and phase acro. 

people usually have a CWDT - steelskin or immortal call or molten shell, vaal molten shell for manual use, etc. there's much more you can do defensively but at some point you have to sacrifice damage to push even further. it's all a matter of personal taste and available currency"
