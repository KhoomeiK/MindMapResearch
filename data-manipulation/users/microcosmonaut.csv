worldnews,ffeom6r,t1_ffeo9vi,1579857598.0,"The bit where Chernobyl is described as having given rise to a nuclear explosion is incorrect from what I understand. I only watched a couple of lectures so take what I say with scepticism, but... in my understanding Chernobyl was closer to a dirty bomb in that it was a regular explosion that spread out dangerously radioactive material."
movies,ffem5jz,t1_ffekybj,1579854005.0,"I don't live in the US, but I get what you're saying. There are benefits to being white. There are also benefits to being black, gay, disabled and pretty much any of the frequently cited intersectional groups. There are also disadvantages to being all of these.

Now before you tell me how some of those are much worse than precisely 3 of the others, let's save us both some time and go straight to the next act. Just because a group of people have it bad, does not mean another group can't also have it bad. Just because a group of people generally have it good does not mean every individual within that group has it good. That's the only point I was and am interested in making."

movies,ffejgfq,t1_ffehon0,1579850522.0,">A tone argument is not just pointing out someone is being obnoxious. It's doing so in lieu of an argument.

You see, that's where you've gone wrong. It's not *in lieu of* anything. That suggests it's a replacement intended to serve as an argument. In fact, they're probably not interested in your argument at all as hard as you may find that to believe.

What if it's just someone subtly telling you you're being kind of a dick? They're not necessarily doing it in an attempt to attack your points. In fact, they said this in as many words. They assumed that you were trying to win people over to your side and informed you (rightly so) that being an asshole is not going to accomplish that."
movies,ffeinpx,t1_ffegyp0,1579849562.0,"The long-lasting socioeconomic effects have been addressed and are being addressed. They haven't been eliminated yet, I agree. Of course my point was an entirely different one.

Firstly, just because non-whites have been and are being oppressed does not mean they have ""exclusive rights"" to oppression. This was clearly implied in the comment I initially replied to.

Secondly, the past certainly helps explain the present, but it doesn't dictate it. At some point things change. If all denial of the present relies on past circumstances rather than current observations, you risk a gross misunderstanding of current events. People need to step outside of their conceptual bubbles and take a look at actual things that are actually happening.

Thirdly, calling people names just highlights the fact that your feelings have been hurt enough to lash out - somewhat ironic, given that the name you chose to use was snowflake. Some would even call that projection."
movies,ffeh8uc,t1_ffe8okl,1579847925.0,"> tone arguments

I absolutely love the way feminism just whacks a label on everything it doesn't like. People calling you out for being obnoxious? Tone policing. Someone out of touch trying to be nice but actually being politically incorrect? Micro aggression. Someone provides a counter-argument? Mansplaining. Good forbid a woman disagrees with anything you say. Nope, it's all good - internalised misogyny.

If all else fails, just reach into the generic oppression bag - racist, sexist, misogynist, bigot, nazi, fragile, literally Hitler."

videos,ff6cxt5,t1_ff6aixh,1579624475.0,Sure! A lot of people are offering explanations as to why this stranger's audience don't give her money as often as she'd like. The explanation I replied to is probably the most simple in that it makes very few assumptions. Children really do have lots of time and little money. That explains everything without having to make any extra assumptions. Occam's Razor would suggest that is a more likely scenario due to its simplicity and relative lack of assumptions.

MakingaMurderer,fdg5nal,t1_fdg1nnx,1578380997.0,"Everyone's a liar if by liar you mean ""somebody who has lied"". The only real question is ""did he lie about killing Theresa Halbach?"".

That's not to say this is an irrelevant point, though. Everyone may lie, but not everyone rapes an underage relative. If it could be proven that he did indeed rape his niece, that'd be something worth taking into account. Until then, the fact that he ""might have lied"" about something is a worthless statement."

worldnews,fd8te1d,t1_fd8eq97,1578223207.0,"> highlights two past actions that in no way identify me as either sexist or bigot

Ironically, this only serves to highlight my point. You provide no evidence whatsoever for sexism or bigotry (despite having access to 6 years of post history), but imply that because I commented somewhere, I must be.

Apparently, the definition of sexism is now to include commenting on an online forum that someone told you was a place that someone told them about where bad people say sexist things.

Try harder. I'm sure you'll find something to latch your canines onto if you go deep enough."
