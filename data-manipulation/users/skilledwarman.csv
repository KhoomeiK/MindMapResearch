Sorry, hes a face huggers fleshlight now. 

The way you got more lives was by rescuing survivors from other decimated squads. Everyone had their own personalities and interactions. I think some had special skills as well but dont quote me on that part. Unique sprites and designs, changes to cut scenes depending on the 4 people on the team you're sending in. 

And a classic Alien/Aliens ending. If you happen to see the game for sale anywhere I highly recommend picking it up"
