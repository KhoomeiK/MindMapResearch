dogs,ffb0n5e,t3_esje72,1579748872.0,"I don't see it mentioned but water helps too. When I worked a daycare, we had a hose ready for fights since the shock of water can be enough.

Method went - hose first, wheelbarrow second, beat with something if it was that bad.

We only had one dog where it took all of that combined where it didn't work and had to pry the dog's mouth open."
dogs,feyh3mr,t3_eqvri3,1579445468.0,"I also don't know too much about cocker spaniels other than my neighbor has one. So I'll tell you about him.

We meet him about three times a day going for about a mile walk. When I bring my border collie mix over, lil man keeps up. My neighbor tells me he is just like any other dog and gets into mischief. His favorite nature snack is deer poo. 

I do think you should stay away from Australian Shepherds. They need more than ""maybe an hour a day, left alone at home."" I don't know bout any working breed until I know where your wife plans to participate and what dogs she's had in the past."
AskReddit,few58j1,t1_few2jf3,1579405578.0,Yeah I believe a male deer because the texture on the bone chip was similar to an anther. Confirmed by a hunter. It was mainly the mystery of not seeing him before or after the impact.
AskReddit,few4yxc,t1_few3vq6,1579405449.0,I was in the middle lane of a three lane road.
AskReddit,few1mjh,t3_eqies2,1579404196.0,"This happened right before this most recent Christmas.

I was driving down the road, kinda dark but still very city. Just driving along, not fiddling with the radio, not looking at my phone, my eyes are very alert.

Suddenly, WHAM! I felt impact. I looked in my rear view mirror, maybe even said what the f out loud. There were other cars behind me and I didn't see anyone swerve or shadows in their headlights or anything that suggested what I hit, or more accurately hit me.

I pull over expecting nothing since I figured it was all in my head. I step out and my driver side door handle has a huge cut in it with a boney chip in it. Huge dent in my door and back wheel well. Evidence suggested a deer.

After insurance calls, I go back to the area, again no sign of a deer. No sign if it was something else. Still a little scared when I drive."
AskReddit,fem4zey,t3_epr0g5,1579239949.0,"Probably not. I really want to say yes but anything over $20, I struggle with buying.

Can I read it in the bookstore or the library?"
dogs,feiud1h,t3_ep5jpm,1579147451.0,"I know you already have enough people who helped you decide but when you put ""I'd rather be too long than too short"" sure... There is definitely too short. But when I made my last dog's decision, he spent 8 hours laying in one spot. We had to lift all 110 pounds of him to my car so we could go to his favorite place. He wouldn't eat his cheeseburger or drink of whiskey (I know we're weird). If I knew the day prior was his day to get these things, I would have let him enjoy these to the fullest rather than lining his gums hoping he could still taste it and that he liked it."
Dogtraining,fbwukrg,t3_eejt40,1577159840.0,"I second contacting the behaviorist as well.

Another thought since it seems to go well 2-3 weeks then an issue arises, is maybe look into medical reasons. What I mean is if there is a weather change, joints can hurt or other medical situations I am not familiar with. Puppy Mill dogs are more likely to have medical issues early in age.

That's all I have to add because I feel msmaynards gave you a fantastic response."
