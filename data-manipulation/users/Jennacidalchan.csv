AskReddit,ffgqm4q,t3_etcyd6,1579912566.0,"I'm not a guy but I have a friend who always tell me how much he appreciates me listening to him. He always say that nobody at home wants to listen to him or help him on anything homework, organizing stuff etc. Whenever he feels worried or sad about anything he comes to me to talk about it because he says he's afraid that his friends will think he is a coward if he's upset about something. 

People keep saying that we are dating in secret but it's not that. I just want to help him feel more comfortable about expressing himself to others and not be afraid of what people will think. All the girls at my school call him a pervert because he's always complimenting everyone but he's just trying to be positive. 

You shouldn't be afraid of talking about something that is bothering you, there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone feels sad once in a while and it's better to talk about it than to just bottle it up.

I was a very shy girl when I first came to America. I didn't speak english very well and I had many friends who helped me, and in the end I found they were just as lost and confused as me. I found out they suffering from depression and anxiety and had no one to talk about. I found out they were being called weird for trying to be friendly to people. I don't find them weird. They are my friends and they helped me in so many ways, and I'm always afraid I might not have helped them enough. 

Sometimes just saying hello to that shy kid in class that everyone dislikes might cheer them up. Sometimes just complimenting someone or asking what's wrong might just make their day. They might not say anything but it will make them happy."

aww,fdp2msr,t3_em93ia,1578618537.0,Reminds me of a bird I had named PeePee (I was 6 at the time we got him and I named him that way due to the sound he made) we were going to a park near my house when my mom's employees called saying there was a bird following them. We went there to see what was wrong and it was a baby bird that had fallen from a nest and kept trying to jump on their shoulders because it was hungry. They were a bit scared so we took it and brought it home. We gave him food bought him a cage and he stayed with us. We'd let him roam around the house when we were awake and he loved to spend time with us. One of the things that I always loved about him is that when my dad or my mom was washing dished he would go into the sink to take a shower. I always thought it was funny. Miss the little guy.

AskReddit,fd3s4m8,t3_ejubhh,1578161211.0,"Brazilian here. 4 years ago me and my mom moved to America so we could start a better life on our own. Coming to America had always been a dream of mine ever since I was a kid. I never thought of moving though, just going to Disney or New York, something like that. When we moved here I must admit that it did feel like what I dreamed of and it still does. The fact that my dumbass even managed to learn how to speak english and get good grades in school still surprises me lol. But it did change my opinion in a couple of things. 

I always thought of here as a paradise. And it's really a wonderful place but you would never hear of the bad thing, you would only hear of good things. And I found that so weird because for half of my life I believed none of those things were ""real"" here. But that's honestly the only opinion that changed for me I guess. They were childish beliefs mostly, I know that there is no where in the world where those things won't be present. 

I love my country, I really do, but I don't want to go back to living there. It's sad seeing what it is like today.  I love it here it's a good place. I have a better future ahead of me here, I have been doing extremely well in therapy way better than before, I have been doing better in school, I have wonderful friends who I would give up my life for, I just finally found a place where I belong. I miss my family, everyone from Brazil, I miss them dearly and I wish I they were here. But I know that they are supporting me being here and they are happy for me."
