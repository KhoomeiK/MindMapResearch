This is what we call a straw man argument. You either don’t know the actual anti-abortion argument or you are misrepresenting it because it is easier to poke holes in. 

It is not the pro life argument that every potential life is sacred. The argument is that human life in the womb is just as worthy of human rights as that outside the womb. A sperm can never become a human being. An egg can never naturally become a human. A fetus is a human, which left alone will become an adult human. 

So either you have no grasp on biology or the pro-life position or you’re just intellectually lazy and dishonest.

>His argument was we should take care of the people that exist because it's the right thing to do and they will give back to society in turn.

The pro-life argument is we shouldn't kill human beings in the womb because it's the right thing to do and they will give back to society in turn.

The only difference between the two arguments is the agenda behind it. OP says you should be nice to people in need because they might one day cure cancer. Pro-lifers could easily say you shouldn't kill unborn babies because they might one day cure cancer. There is very little difference between the two. They're both stupid arguments.

If you think it's morally right to help people in need, that should be your message. If you think it's morally wrong to kill unborn babies, that should be your message.

They should not be unnecessarily shoved around. But if they are not following the rules, then physical contact is often warranted. This guard didn't push the inmate back to be a dick.

It depends on the context. If someone comes up to me on the street and shoves me, I'd probably angry ask, ""What the fuck is your problem, asshole?""

nursing,ff8kaom,t3_es0frw,1579682528.0,"A BSN is simply a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. There are Associate's Degrees in Nursing as well. Both are a path to becoming an RN or Registered Nurse. 

You might have also heard of LVN or LPN, Licensed Vocational/Practical Nurse. These are not RN's while they are nurses. There are limitations to what LVNs can do and unless you want to work in rehab or a nursing home, it will probably be hard to find a job in a hospital as an LVN.

Both ADN and BSN have their pros and cons. ADN degrees are generally cheaper, shorter and easier to get. I have ""just and ADN"" and I became a nurse within 2.5 years and only spent $5000 for everything to get it. However, it's often harder for an ADN to get a job, especially as a GN or Graduate Nurse. As others have said, hospitals like to staff BSNs because studies indicate they have positive impacts on patient mortality. A BSN is going to cost more and take longer to achieve. It's a 4-year degree that has more core and non-core classes than an ADN.

It really doesn't matter all that much where you get your degree. Once you're an RN, the only real thing people look at is if you're an ADN or BSN. And even then, it's not that big of a deal once you get some experience. There are 80 nurses on staff on my floor. Nobody really knows or cares where anyone else went to school or what type of degree they have. We're all nurses, at the end of the day.

I believe you might be talking about an RN to BSN program at that community college. These are pathways for ADNs to get their BSN degrees. So make sure the program you're looking at isn't a ADN to BSN bridge program. If you can get your BSN within your price range and don't mind 4 more years of school, I'd say go for it. For me, I wanted to graduate and start making an income again ASAP, and an ADN program was perfect for me."

explainlikeimfive,fedg3em,t3_eolbst,1579010579.0,"High blood pressure or hypertension is not just caused by excess fluid volume (i.e. too much blood). While fluid volume contributes to hypertension, simply taking out a pint of blood from a circulatory system with 4.7-5.5 L of blood isn't going to do very much in terms of curing hypertension. It might cause a temporary and minor decrease, but that volume will quickly be replaced by other fluids in the body and fluid you consume. Yes it does take time for the body to produce red blood cells, but the fluid that makes up plasma is mostly water, which is replaced within minutes to hours of donating a pint of blood. That's why they tell you to drink plenty of fluids after donating blood."

* His timely removal off of suicide precautions for no reason released to the public
* Both guards sleeping during their shift and faking the logs
* Two cameras in front of Epstein's cell malfunctioned and a third had ""footage that was unusable.""
* The sheet he ""hanged himself"" was described as ""paper level"" and hardly strong enough to be used in a hanging
* Epstein not having a cellmate like he was required to have
* His hyoid bone was broken, more consistent with being strangled and not by hanging (without a violent drop)

Even William Barr said Epstein's ""suicide"" was a ""perfect storm of screw-ups."" Yes, any one of those ""screw-ups"" might be believable, but taken as a whole, it's highly suspicious. Either multiple safety/security systems went wrong and people just coincidentally screwed up or this was a concerted effort to kill someone who had a lot of dirt on some very powerful people."
