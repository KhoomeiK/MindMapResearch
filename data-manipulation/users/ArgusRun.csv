AmItheAsshole,fgglwic,t1_fggkqjz,1580764596.0,"Lots of people manage to be violent without breaking the law.  It's not even a matter of whether they would physically hurt someone, but plenty will be willing to harass her over this."
AmItheAsshole,fggldn9,t3_eydq72,1580764285.0,"NTA - She's TA but just barely because it sounds like she badly parroting some of her own therapy.  OCD and eating disorders can present in a similar manner and can both be present and overlap.   


She shouldn't be bringing it up after you clearly corrected her and told her to stop.  If you otherwise value the relationship and want to give it one more try, you can say to her that you are under the care of an expert and that her behavior is contraindicated for your own health and recovery.  Tell her how proud you are of her progress and that you are sure she knows how important it is to follow your doctor's instructions.  Anytime she brings it up after that, just say goodbye and hang up/walk out."
AmItheAsshole,fggkikj,t3_eydrmj,1580763769.0,NTA - But I'd polish up that resume.

AmItheAsshole,fggieyh,t3_eyd13r,1580762519.0,"NAH - But there are two points where if you continue to harp on them that will turn you into TA.  


1) The 16 yo does not want the room  for sex.  Don't focus on that, instead, as you acknowledge, it's normal for a teen girl to want privacy.  


2) The 16yo is not a ""beggar""  She didn't choose this and she has no choice in the situation.  Her mother is the one who accepted the living situation.  She might not have good options, but she is the one who made the decision.  The teen is the completely innocent party in this."

AmItheAsshole,fggdgkf,t3_eyckgf,1580759557.0,"NTA - But you need to understand that people in abusive relationships don't act the way you think they will.  You are conditioned to believe there really is no options.  That no one else will love or accept you.  That you deserve this.

I'm worried you  might think the abuse isn't real because of her past actions.  Treat it like it's deadly serious but you don't have the money to get them a place.  Instead of offering rent, offer to help them get in touch with domestic violence groups in your area.  Do some research, offer to take the kids for a while. Anything you can do short of going on the lease for another home."

AmItheAsshole,fggcihh,t1_fggbobl,1580758978.0,"I can get being upset.  But banning your fiancee's best friend from the wedding is the nuclear options.

That said, this feel like one of those instances where a little ego stroking might work to smooth things over.  Explain to your mom how she has been such and amazing mother AND mentor, teaching you how to be a  gracious host.  And how you know she wants nothing more than for the guests to have a delicious meal and a fabulous time.   


Can you get together to cook with her?  Show her some recipes you've learned, maybe do a special thing where you write down her recipes for your new home.

If I may make a gentle suggestion.  As you look through your home and life together, see if there's anything of his that makes you think of your step-daughter.  A watch he wore to her graduation.  A gift she got him.  Then offer it to her.  Remember him and tell about how he loved it, loved her.  I feel that you making the offer will mean so much more to both of you."

Lot's of dogs don't ""like"" the rain.  Get the dog a coat go for a walk.  Just popping outside is not stimulating enough.  


This pupper sounds like she has energy and brainpower to burn.  Discipline isn't just about saying ""no"" it's about giving them what they need to avoid problematic behaviors."

These types of jobs usually create a sense of ""gallows humor""  It's not great, but common enough within the group that I can understand it.  However, taking it outside the group it makes you the asshole.  Because the prisoners are people.  With families, and lives, and people who love them.  And teaching children that they are simply punchlines and normalizing prison rape to them is a shitty, shitty thing to do.  Please stop."
AmItheAsshole,ff95xqp,t3_esd36b,1579705612.0,"ESH - Both of you need to learn about raising/training/owning dogs.  Even if it's raining/snowing, you put on a coat and go for a supervised walk.  You yelling at the dog is not discipline.  It's just barking.  Him coddling is not training, it's just confusing and positive reinforcement for unwanted behavior.

Now in  regards to you venting on the phone to you husband, you should absolutely be allowed to.  That's how we all keep from acting inappropriately during the actual situation.  You vent later so you don't blow up at the dog.  May I suggest a conversation where you say sometimes I just need to vent and have sympathy from you.  I'm not really looking for advice or excuses just an opportunity to express my frustrations.

Then you actually say ""Hi honey, I just need to vent for a minute""  This gives him the cue to know you are about to get worked up and all he has to do is go ""I'm so sorry, honey.  That sounds awful.  Wish I was there to help.""

Everyone has different relationships and as long as it's filled with love and respect, we can all have different boundaries.  I deeply love and respect my husband.  I have conversations with him that I can't have with my parents.  I have conversations with them I can't have with him.  Or would choose not to.    


A person giving birth is in a particularly vulnerable state and is the final arbiter of who gets to be there.   Period.  If you respect your partner, you respect them in this.  It's not a hard concept for me.
