Or is it that they *do* enter the p-region and cross the junction, but they do it very slowly, because to cross the junction each electron must cross a sea of negatively charged ions (which comprise the p-side depletion region), which slows them significantly down?

That's the idea that makes the most sense to me so far."
askscience,fespujc,t1_fesiwsh,1579367760.0,"Wow, that was a great explanation (except I think you mixed up the direction of the electric field, it points n to p, that's the direction that would oppose majority drift)!

Next question: it's a lack of minority carriers in either region that results in a low drift current, but why can't a power source supply additional electrons to the p-side, thus increasing the drift current?"
askscience,fes74ty,t1_fepovol,1579362093.0,"I think it just clicked.

Electron flow toward the junction in the p-region is equivalent to hole movement away from the junction.  As the voltage increases, more holes are recombined with by electrons (the depletion region grows), so the total number of holes decreases.

The voltage (energy per charge carrier) goes up, but the total number of charge carriers goes down proportionally, and so the current remains a constant (the leakage current) until you reach a high enough voltage to create new charger carriers in the depletion region.

Correct?"
askscience,ferysuy,t1_ferxavf,1579359744.0,"Okay, majority carriers are holes in the p-region, and free electrons in the n-region, right?  And minority carriers would be holes in the n-region and electrons in the p-region?  And you distinguish between diffusion and drift.  What's the difference?"

askscience,ferfh19,t1_fepquom,1579353301.0,So free electrons that come into the p-region from the negative battery terminal (if they could) would become bound to the atoms that have holes upon entering the p-region.  Correct?
askscience,ferf4r2,t1_feq4jfv,1579353173.0,"I get that.  What I'm wondering is this:

Suppose you're an electron sitting in the negative terminal of the battery, with the diode reverse biased.

askscience,fepphv2,t1_fepovol,1579326991.0,"Wait, wait, wait.  What if you have some sort of low voltage, high current device trying to reverse bias drive a diode below breakdown voltage.  Why couldn't it supply an endless stream of free electrons to pass right over the depletion region?"
askscience,fepp2ds,t1_fepovol,1579326604.0,So it's literally just the fact that there are fewer total charge carriers?  And the breakdown voltage occurs when you strip the electrons from the dopant ions?
askscience,fepoxuf,t1_fepnj1j,1579326497.0,"Sorry, I see what you're saying about that now.  So, what happens when all the holes are filled?  

The way I see it, the depletion region contains negative ions in the p-side.  Atoms that previously had holes, but which had an electron forced into them, making them negatively charged.  When you apply a reverse bias voltage, you increase the depletion region, and thus the number of negative ions.  These negative ions repel would-be-incoming electrons from the negative terminal of the battery."
askscience,fepo4qy,t1_fepnugl,1579325793.0,"I get that there are fewer total charge carriers in the diode, but why can't the few that there are cross the depletion region?  Or the free electrons coming out of the battery?"

askscience,fepmola,t1_fepm09l,1579324584.0,"Well, electrons move through the p-region when the diode is conducting in forward bias.  Past the threshold voltage electrons from the battery move across the whole diode.  

Here, let me ask the question another way:

Suppose an electron from the battery moved from the negative terminal into the p-region of the diode during reverse bias.  Suppose it got all the way up to the depletion region.  It would see inside the depletion region an electric field that is pointing in such a direction as to speed it up.  

Why can't an electron move from the negative terminal of the battery into the p-region of the diode and then into the depletion region?  It's not the electric field that keeps the electron out, because it's pointing in a direction that would speed it up.  So what keeps it out?"
askscience,fepm78y,t1_fepm08g,1579324188.0,It does not answer my question.  I want to know what is physically keeping electrons out of the depletion region.  Why is it insulating?
askscience,feplomm,t1_fepla1k,1579323783.0,"I know that the depletion region grows when reverse biased.  But the electric field in the depletion region points from n to p.  Electrons move in the opposite direction an electric field points.  Electrons from the battery are trying to come into the p-region during reverse bias.  They are trying to move from p to n, the opposite direction of the electric field vector, so the electric field should bolster them, not oppose them."
askscience,fepkv04,t1_fepkh1k,1579323149.0,"In simpler terms, can this be restated as:

Reverse biasing the diode creates additional negative ions in the p-region (more than are present during forward bias).  These negative ions repel incoming electrons from the battery (which are trying to come into the p-region during reverse bias).  If you increase the battery voltage to try to shove the electrons into the p-region, that voltage creates additional negative ions which repel the electrons even more.  The breakdown voltage would occur when the p-region becomes saturated with negative ions, and can no longer increase its repulsion against incoming electrons.

Is that correct?"
askscience,fepkd6t,t1_fepjyqf,1579322765.0,"Why can't electrons from the battery enter the depletion region?  What is keeping them out?  The way I understand it, in forward biased mode it is the electric field in the depletion region that keeps them out.  If you supply a battery voltage that overcomes that electric field, then current flows.  

BUT, when you switch to reverse bias, the polarity of the electric field in the depletion region doesn't change; it still points from n to p just like it does in forward bias mode.  So if the electric field opposes the current in forward bias mode, shouldn't switching the current direction (switching to reverse bias) WITHOUT switching the polarity of the electric field within the depletion region result in an electric field which would *bolster* current instead of opposing it?"
askscience,fepjgmq,t1_fepj5c5,1579322077.0,"No charge carriers being present in the depletion zone doesn't explain why charge carriers from the battery cannot enter.  I believe the answer is that the negative ions in the p-region prevent electrons from flowing into the p-region during reverse bias.  Holes being pulled away from the junction creates more negative ions in the junction than are present during forward bias, and these negative ions repel electrons that would be coming into the p-region from the battery.  Furthermore, any electrons that do make it into the p-region from the battery fall into the holes and just create more negative ions, making it even harder for future electrons to get in.  At least that's what I've been able to deduce over the last couple of hours."
