The issue is the potential risk, not that someone has died from it.

This is not good, in case you were wondering. It could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome.

I'm a girl, I've learned about TSS through my own gynecologists and in a sex ed course in high school. You're foolish to assert it can't be deadly, aside from renal failure, death is one of the complications of TSS if not caught early. Idk and won't assume your gender, but women have a crazy amount of bacteria ""down there"" naturally...From basic biology courses you'll learn that certain bacteria prefer and thrive in humid, dark, and porous substrates.

She peddles some pretty dangerous stuff. That ""jade vaginal egg"" made claims that it could help women strengthen their pelvic floor and assist in regulating their menstrual cycle.

There are people that unfortunately are not smart or diligent enough to research for themselves and instead take things at face value. I think we as a society need to have rules in place to protect consumers from these kinds of predatory practices, where a company can essentially push a claims to a product that has not been backed by reliable and comprehensive scientific evidence.

While some products are laughable, a product like the jade egg - if used as the site originally described, could be dangerous and potentially fatal. Jade is porous af, there is no way a person could sanitize it between uses and this could lead to a gross build up of bacteria and lead to something as dangerous as toxic shock syndrome. So...

As someone that has lived in several countries, and multiple states within the US - Many Americans I knew growing up thought they had it better simply because that's what they were told. There's more to it than that, while some may say the US have a low poverty rate (~13% from 2017 Census Estimates), this doesn't account for the fact that present-day poverty is determined by using a poverty line which was set over 50 years ago and only accounting for inflation.

Those with the recessive AA genotype on the ABCC11 gene (on chromosome 16) will produce mildly odored sweat and likely dry earwax.

Those with the alleles containing a G (GG or GA pair) will produce a glycosylated protein which can attribute to sweat and the wet earwax phenotype. It is hypothesized that the gene's role in sweat odor is partly due to the quantitative dosage of ABCC11 protein."

todayilearned,fcvgcqn,t1_fcvdgvi,1578001516.0,"From the same Wiki: 

> Watson was shown the photo by his collaborator, Maurice Wilkins, without Rosalind Franklin's knowledge. Wilkins did this, as by this time, Gosling had returned under his supervision, since Franklin was leaving King's and Randall had asked Gosling to share all his data with Wilkins..[10] 

Paraphrasing from another article posted through the Science History Institute:

> Of the four DNA researchers, only Rosalind Franklin had any degrees in chemistry.


> After the war, through a French friend, she gained an appointment at the Laboratoire Centrale des Services Chimiques de l’Etat in Paris, where she was introduced to the technique of X-ray crystallography and rapidly became a respected authority in this field. In 1951 she returned to England to King’s College London, where her charge was to upgrade the X-ray crystallographic laboratory there for work with DNA. 


> Already at work at King’s College was Maurice Wilkins, a New Zealand–born but Cambridge-educated physicist. 


> Franklin’s excellent X-ray photographs, to which they had gained access without her permission, were critical to the correct solution. The four scientists announced the structure of DNA in articles that appeared together in the same issue of Nature.


> It was Wilkins’s idea to study DNA by X-ray crystallographic techniques, which he had already begun to implement when Franklin was appointed by Randall. The relationship between Wilkins and Franklin was unfortunately a poor one and probably slowed their progress. 

It's a very complicated situation, however, there is no reason to take random soundbites and piecemeal them together to discredit people who contributed to the work. Gosling gets credit where due, but Franklin was a well respected person in her field and ultimately guided him through the process for capturing these photographs. There, they share at most equal status in the role.

From Gosling's Wiki:

> While a PhD student at King's College, London he worked under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin. Their crystallographic experiments, together with those of Maurice Wilkins of the same laboratory, produced data that helped James Watson and Francis Crick to infer the structure of DNA.


> Working with Franklin, Gosling produced the first X-ray diffraction photographs of the ""form B"" paracrystalline arrays of highly hydrated DNA. During the next two years, the pair worked closely together to perfect the technique of x-ray diffraction photography of DNA and obtained at the time the sharpest diffraction images of DNA. In 1951 Gosling made the X-ray diffraction image of DNA known as Photograph 51.[8]


> After the initial work producing the first x-ray diffraction of DNA, Randall reassigned Gosling to work with Rosalind Franklin, who had been just hired to join King's College in 1951. He did this without consulting with Wilkins, a factor which may have contributed to the animosity between the two.[7]

The award was ultimately given to those that were still alive (Nobel prizes are not posthumously awarded, unfortunately). But these scientists weren't even the first to uncover the structure of DNA. It was built on the backs of previous research, as most scientific research goes:

> Florence Ogilvy Bell (1 May 1913 – 23 November 2000), later Florence Sawyer, was a British scientist who contributed to the discovery of the structure of DNA. She was an X-ray crystallographer in the lab of William Astbury. In 1938 they published a paper in Nature that described the structure of DNA as a ""Pile of Pennies"".[3]"
