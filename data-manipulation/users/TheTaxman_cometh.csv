The old's NFL blackout rules stated and game that didn't sell out in time (something like 85% by 24 hours before kickoff but don't quote me on those exact numbers) would be blacked out within a 60 mile radius of the stadium. The thing was it measured the entire theoretical broadcast radius of the station so Syracuse stations, 150 miles from Buffalo, could theoretically be picked up within 60 miles of the Ralph. Realistically though, they were 2 broadcast markets away and no one within 60 miles would have received the broadcast due to interference from more local stations.

tax,fegt7xc,t1_fegsogo,1579101993.0,Right but the emerald card has debit functionality and a PIN since you can get money out of an ATM for a $3 fee plus the ATM fee. Get a bluebird card from bluebird.com go to walmart with it and ask to load $1500 then a second load of $1000 (YMMV if they will allow you to load twice in a row). Use the Emerald Card as a debit POS purchase (should be fee free) and now you've got the funds on a different prepaid card that will definitely allow you to ACH to any bank account or bill pay directly without a fee like the Emerald Card charges for bill pay.  I'd definitely figure out if you can ACH from the Emerald directly to your bank fee free first since that will be easier and faster but I was giving you an alternative option in case they want to charge a fee for an ACH transfer.
