She is totally out of order & I can't comprehend how she doesn't understand why you wouldn't want your child named after a random booty call. In every other regard ESH - you shouldn't be having another child at the moment, it won't automatically fix your marriage I'm afraid."
AmItheAsshole,fffbibg,t3_et64a6,1579880312.0,"NAH - You're mum is just clutching at straws trying to find a reason your dad *couldn't have betrayed her with the evil porn*... I kinda get that she'd be in denial if she knew nothing about him watching that. 

However it is weird of her to start talking about you wearing a bra around your brother... It sounds like she's seriously just trying to convince herself it was him & this is now part of her thought process. Either that, or she's been wondering when to broach this subject with you & it seemed like the appropriate time with porn coming up... Still odd though.

I wouldn't worry about it though - I think your mum's just overreacting, I don't think she has any malicious intent by saying this to you & from what you've said, you've handled the situation very maturely. Well done!"
RandomActsofCards,ffe745o,t3_esq5t9,1579838473.0,"Hi there, I noticed your request for something to brighten your day up earlier - I'm from the U.K & have been in some really low spots with my disability too & I also love cats! 
I've been a lurker on here for a while, but would love to send you something to cheer you up! If you give me your addy, I shall sort something out for you & if you ever want to whinge or chat, feel free to message me. I understand how crappy it is when your body won't do what you want it to, but you'll find ways around things even if it doesn't seem like it now!
I'm sorry to hear you've had your old way of life taken away from you, but I assure you, you will find new ways to do things. Wishing you all the best!"
