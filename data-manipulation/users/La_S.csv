OCPoetry,ffu0drw,t3_ev66k9,1580231753.0,"Conformity and uniformity is always mistaken as 'well-behaved'. How far from the truth! It just shows the ability to adapt. 

It made me think of 'the sons of thunder' - James and John in the Bible. There was no silencing them and Jesus never condemned them for being who they were, only for applying their voices to the wrong things.

David Brenner writes: "" We should never be tempted to think that growth in Christ-likeness reduces our uniqueness...Being most deeply your unique self is something that God desires, because your true self is grounded in Christ. God created you in uniqueness and seeks to restore you to that uniqueness in Christ. Finding and living out your true self is fulfilling your destiny."""
Journaling,fftc77n,t3_eubx21,1580216109.0,"Have you seen bullet journal habit trackers? These work brilliantly.

Turn your page landscape. Write the month's dates along the top of the page. Write the habits you want to cultivate in a list down the left-hand side of the page. Place an X under each day you do that habit. 

|*Date:*|*1*|*2*|*3*|*4*|*5*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Meditated|X||X|X||
|Exercised||X|X||X|

Or, use a line graph if you're tracking time spent/intensity etc. 

Put dates on the x-axis and time/your intensity scale/your levels on the y-axis. If the y-axis is the same for several habits, you can plot them on the same graph using a different colour for each habit."
BasicBulletJournals,fftbe62,t3_ei85gc,1580215341.0,"Do you suffer with feeling unproductive? It may be that you're trying to make up for that feeling of lack by adding 'productive' lists to your bujo.

If that's the case, maybe just rapid log what you do each day, however simple - food shop, chore, spoke with 'x', stood in the sun etc. You'll start to see how you use your day and that you do actually achieve things. If you want to add something to your bujo, maybe a list of gratitude or of things that bring you joy, and add to the list each day/week.

If you're wanting to add something because you have an itch to be more creative, add a spread for doodles or go back through your bujo and add decorations with washi, pens etc.

If you're procrastinating from something by scrolling through bujo pics, then maybe spend 10 minutes just writing out exactly what you're feeling right now, what's worrying you, what you'd rather be doing, what you're avoiding, where your mind is at right now, what you're looking forward to etc. Just write, don't judge. Don't try and segment or list. Just write. You'll write about stuff you hadn't even intended to write about because our thoughts just flow. It may help you, on reading back, to see what the issue is. Or, it might just be cathartic to have written stuff down and that's solution enough."
BasicBulletJournals,ffta9hf,t3_eq9d4m,1580214190.0,"Please don't add stuff for the sake of it. It's a waste of your time and space in the bujo. You'll also need to migrate them all (if they're useful still) when you get a new journal. It sounds to me like you either a) want a reason to procrastinate that feels somewhat productive, or b) you want a further creative outlet. If it's a), maybe a collection or tracker of things you use to procrastinate might be a good idea so you can assess how much time you waste on them. If it's b) then find out what it is that you really want to create. Buy a sketchbook or learn to doodle/decorate your bujo in dedicated time set aside for that. 

But if you must have another collection:

* Places you'd like to visit and why
* Things you want to do in your city
* Alternative ideas for nights out/in
* Jobs you've heard of and want to explore more
* Recipes you want to try
* Podcasts to listen to
* Things that bring you real joy
* Things you're thankful for
* Packing list for weekends away/holidays (not so much a collection as a handy spread)

But collections shouldn't be created and filled in one go. They're for you to collect things in as you go through life."
bujo,fft8fj8,t3_eruuxp,1580212104.0,"Make it as simple as you like. Anything you won't use, don't bother including. 

Mine looks like this:

* **Index** \- 3 pages
* **Future log** \- 2 spreads, 3 months to a page (I don't actually use this for planning my year, I use Google calendar for appointments, Birthdays etc. but I've found that the future log is a really nice format for reviewing the year at the end because I only add the most significant events in it)
* **Monthly** (again, I like this because of the overview-at-a-glance it gives me, not because I rely on it for planning)
* **Habit tracker** (I sometimes omit this. I tend to only put in a tracker when I've been slipping on keeping up my good habits and need some visual accountability)
* **Weekly** \- This is the heart of my bullet journal. I set up one at a time just before the week starts. I write out the days (M-S) and their dates down the left-hand side of the page. I write in events with their times under the day header. On the right-hand side, I put the day's tasks. Sometimes I use one page, sometimes I do 4 days on one page and 3 days on the next, depending on how busy the week is.
* **Daily** \- I rarely do these at the minute. But if I do, I just write the day and date and rapid log some of the stuff that's happened or maybe write it out a bit more prose-like if I have stuff I need to chew over and work out. 

Like I said, if my bullet journal was only weeklies, I'd still be just as organised as I am with all the other bits. But I add in and remove what is/isn't helpful on a month by month basis. You'll keep changing your journal to fit your needs, but start with the basic layout and you can adapt as you go. From this thread alone you can see that everyone uses the journal differently!"
bujo,fft6vcr,t3_esn70i,1580210140.0,"Don't worry! You'll adjust things month by month. Having a 'perfect' bullet journal is a fallacy because, as your life changes, so do your bullet journal needs. My first few months were a spider scrawl of all sorts of random setups and page orders, but I slowly settled into what worked for me (which is often somewhat different to the things I see on here). And I've kept tweaking things since.

If you want to track habits by day, I'd put them near your monthly spread. If you're tracking by week/month (perhaps your spending?), put them at the back as they're not 'tied' to a month and you'll be using them through the year. For miscellaneous spreads, like a year in photos,  put them at the back too with plenty of room to fit in what you want. If you run out of space, no worries. Just washi tape/glue in extra paper at the back as spare pages. It's not a bujo beauty contest ;) But maybe think ahead and decide on approximately 3 photos per month or similar so you can plan space.

Indexing is your saviour. Index all the pages you want to be able to return to (e.g. I don't index my weeklies or dailies unless something pertinent happened that day that I want to find again)."

copywriting,ff2o2o9,t3_erak65,1579515763.0,"To start coming up with ideas, write down all the words associated with fitness, workouts, and the gym.

E.g. Cardio, muscle, heartbeat, run, strength, weight, fit, health, workout, sweat, breathe, capacity, PB, 360, etc.

Then list out a load of adjectives that you associate with fitness.

E.g. Intense, healthy, pumped, strong, hardcore, revitalising, maverick, power etc.

Then try listing out the types of people or places that are known for fitness.

E.g. marine, athlete, trainer, barracks, boot camp, etc.

See if you can combine any of those words. See if you can find any words associated with these in [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com) to give you more ideas. Or, go totally off the beaten track and try using your surname, or use a colour that you want to associate with your brand (e.g. Teal Training). Hope that helps spark ideas!"

acne,fenal1k,t3_eq02ng,1579280559.0,"Dr Organic Aloe Vera moisturising cream is working amazingly for me to clear up the red scarring and dark spots. I can see the difference after just 4 weeks.  I too used to have very severe acne and didn't want to go down the route of isotrets etc. for multiple reasons, so I've tackled my acne with store-bought products and a diet change.

For cleansing, use something that's gentle. I use cleanse with Dr Organic charcoal fase wash in the morning in the shower and then a micellar water and Dermalogica cleanser in the evening.

If you use acne treatments like salicylic acid, use it once every three days to begin with to avoid getting really dry, flaky, itchy skin. If the acid isn't having a negative effect on your skin, you can try using it a little more frequently (or use less frequently if it's irritating).

I realised that stress (and hence tiredness) and processed sugar (including fast-converting carbs like bread) were my two biggest factors in acne flare ups. These affected my hormones. Adding morning oatmeal/porridge to my diet as well as lentils or grains like quinoa at lunch increased my iron intake and have really helped. (Good side effect of the good diet: no period pain.)

Do go to the nurse/doctor and get checked for PCOS and fibroids if there is history in your family. Fixing these issues can fix a lot of other issues too!"

analytics,fejytg8,t3_epiv3i,1579188937.0,"Like others have said, the terms aren't that well defined and are variations of marketing buzzwords. However, my two cents would be to suggest that 'advanced analytics' is a catch-all term for anything that uses machine learning algorithms.

 That means that both 'AI analytics' and 'predictive analytics' can probably be loosely categorised under 'advanced analytics'. 

'AI analytics' is often not true AI, but it's the use of machine learning algorithms to surface data changes and insights, help with the analysis of data points...any sort of automation. 

'Predictive analytics' is usually used to refer to analytics that uses machine learning to predict the trends of or forecast the future. If you have data on retail sales patterns for your red shoes for the last 18 months, 'predictive analytics' could forecast the next 3 months."

careerwomen,fejf4pf,t3_ep34kn,1579171145.0,"Ask what systems people use to keep organised - is there a tool or method that's fairly standard in the organisation?

If you have loads of tasks and you don't know which to start on first, ask your manager what tasks should take priority/who your key clients are. 

Get to know the colleagues you'll be working with - maybe see if anyone wants to go for lunch with you tomorrow at 1 pm? You can suggest somewhere simple like a sandwich shop that you can all sit in if that's where people usually grab lunch. If you don't know here people usually go, ask a colleague to show you where the good lunch spots are and then you've got at least one person to get to know. 

Embrace being the newbie and ask all the questions, even if they seem dumb. Later, you'll be so glad you asked rather than keep quiet! People forget to tell you things because they're the norm in that workplace and forget not everywhere uses the same processes, thinks the same way, has the same culture etc. Even prefix the question with, ""Maybe this seems a basic question, but I want to learn how it works here and do things right, so..."""
