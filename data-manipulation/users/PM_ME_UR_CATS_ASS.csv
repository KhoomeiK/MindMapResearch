oculus,ffgfofs,t1_ffgf7dn,1579905182.0,"Fair enough. I doubt Oculus couldn't have guessed they'd be bought out by Facebook when they made the Oculus account thing. But them getting bought out is a whole other can of worms

Cheers for the reply, was feeling like I was gonna be berated and bigraded haha. Not a fan of FB either but it feels like this Oculus-Valve competition is what's driving VR right now"
oculus,ffge991,t1_ffg5nhm,1579904286.0,"Why don't you just create a random bogus account strictly for VR?  Just don't use any personal info and then you're probably sending Facebook as much data as you are to Valve with your Steam account.  At least Oculus is pretty up front about it

This is all just me using common sense so I'm probably wrong in an area or two"
