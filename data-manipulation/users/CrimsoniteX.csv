Most auto shops will check it for free, there is no reason not to have it checked ASAP. Once you understand why it’s on, then you can make an educated decision on whether you can afford to ignore it or not."

NorthCarolina,ffqqz15,t3_eup9is,1580141604.0,Something the study doesn’t seem to account for is how long the light is yellow for in each state - because it absolutely varies and I would think whether you slow down or not is a function of how much time you think you have.

networking,ffjsu4y,t1_ffjpy3q,1580006005.0,Really? I would think a tier 1 NOC position would grab you in a heartbeat. Have you tried looking at contractor jobs to get a foot in the door? Best of luck to you in that job search.

Anyway... although I did A+ and Sec+ in retrospect they were a complete waste of my time. If you are a beginner looking to get certs, just jump right into the associate level ones."

amateurradio,feikovp,t1_fegun1e,1579140773.0,Yup. A lot of people seem to not understand how fragile our current privileges are. It’s more important that you have an organization to protect those privileges than it is to agree with every little thing they do (or do not) do.
amateurradio,feh5d17,t3_ep1xg1,1579109477.0,"I have only read through about half of it, but they did a really good job so far. More focused on younger hams (20s to 30s), newer technologies like SDR, and well illustrated infographics explaining the fundamentals.

Edit: I also like the simple diy projects new hams would actually be comfortable with."

Fitness,fe2rj4l,t3_enjh5o,1578842040.0,"This is completely anecdotal, but a buddy of mine (\~5'9"") and myself (6'4"") started working out at the same time and worked out together for two years. We stayed in sync more or less the entire time, each putting on around 30 lbs of muscle by the end of the two years. However, also by the end of the two years - his gains were starting to slow significantly whereas I still felt like I had room to grow. We stopped working out together about six months ago, and my lifts have continued to grow by around 20% since.

So (again anecdotally), I think the rate at which you grow muscle is the same - but as others have said, the taller person has more room to grow. Oversimplifying it a bit, but it makes since when you think about it -  all things being equal, a bigger person should be able to move more weight."
