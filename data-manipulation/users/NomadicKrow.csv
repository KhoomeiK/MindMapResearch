You know...  Kinda tired of this. It's very shallow and shortsighted to just say this and think it tells you all you need to know about the FF. Truth is, their plan from the beginning was to end slavery but southern states vied for more time because they couldn't immediately replace a workforce and it would decimate our fledgling country's ability to produce goods. I don't agree with that, but that's the argument they used. They were given ten years, but they just never really started implementing anything to replace slaves as a workforce.

Eventually, as you know, the civil war was fought to end slavery. It is still the bloodiest conflict we've participated in, and at least 620,000 white men died to end that barbaric tradition."
