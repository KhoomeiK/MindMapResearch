The way I see it, people only use that phrase for 2 reasons:

1.they are a credible threat to their own health and welfare.
2. they don't yet understand that's not a phrase you just throw around.

Sending EMS over addresses both possible reasons."

relationships,ffwl1r8,t3_evcfsr,1580304357.0,"Caving to her parents now sets a tone for your entire marriage. Further, what your in-laws are calling a ""tradition"" is really more of a leash. And not the least bit worrying, your father in law inserted himself in the middle of a very intimate tradition, which he either did on purpose to stop you from giving her a ring, or he doesn't see it as intrusive behaviour, and I'm honestly not sure which would be worse.

The fact that they are so threatened by a piece of jewelry (regardless of its pricetag) is a very bad sign. It reminds me of a family I knew, where Dad would say, ""Here, Daughter, I bought you this poster of a band you like to hang on your wall."" And then the second she misbehaves he marches up to her bedroom, declares her ""poster privileges"" revoked, tears them off the wall, and throws them out. A few months later, he'd buy her a new poster, and the cycle would begin again. 

Your future in-laws basically gave her something they can threaten to take away when she steps out of line. A basic, ""you're doing something I don't want you to do, therefore you are going against the family and our traditions, therefore you obviously don't want to be a part of this family, therefore I'll take your ring back now."" Kind of thing. 

It is textbook emotional manipulation and frankly the best thing you could do for your future wife is to encourage her to put some distance between her and her parents and set up clear and strong boundaries."

I have depression. And a few other challenges to boot. I had it in college. Know what else I had in college? A 3.8. Nothing makes me angrier than people giving mental illness additional bad press by acting like an entitled twat. We can kick ass in the world without breaking rules, we just need a bit of support. 

When you have depression, you don't need people to do your homework. You need medication, counseling, support from your campus' center for students with disabilities, to discuss your situation with your prof or TA. Or any combination thereof. But you do not need other people to do your work for you.

I find that my anxiety (which is something I live with in addition to introversion) is actually very affected by when I take my alone time. If I take the time before the day begins, I can maintain some optimism; the day is fresh without any disasters so far.

Even though it is your wife who put the strain on your marriage (assuming it was entirely healthy before the affair), if you still want the marriage, you're going to have to put effort into keeping it alive. It's not fair, but that's how life works.

If you would rather have the friendship, that's fine too. But it's a choice you need to make. Maintaining that friendship will never allow you and your wife to put the affair in the past, and I am all but certain no marriage can be rebuilt under those circumstances."

The thing that kept me from going back to my doctors was this need to be ""okay."" As long as I didn't admit I was backsliding into depression, I didn't need to see a doctor, and if I didn't see a doctor, I wasn't depressed. I had this identity forged around having overcome depression once before, and I couldn't admit I had relapsed or my entire identity would collapse.

Denial kept me going through the motions for a couple of years, but I never got any better until I walked into a hospital and told them to do whatever it took to stop this horrible constant feeling of having nothing to live for and my doom was imminent anyway.

""Whatever it took"" turned out to be occupational therapy, a low dose of antidepressant/anxiety medication, tai chi classes, and eventually a career change. She may need different things, but what's most important is that she is ready to accept them.

For me, I had to feel like going to the hospital couldn't make anything worse, and it would probably be the only thing left to try that could save what little was left in my life that I still cared about. But it's hard to get there. You can ""just survive"" for years.

Your wife seems like she's clinging to something just like I was clinging to my ""okay"" identity. Something that makes her unwilling to ""talk to a stranger"" or give medication a chance. They pose a threat to something--something she sees as one of the last good things in her life. It might be like me--if she doesn't see a therapist, she must be fine. Or she could be afraid of medication side-effects. I definitely was. 

She'll have to become ready get help mostly by herself, but in the mean time, you can try asking what makes her want to continue living this way. What is good about her life? Why does she think therapy or medication could ruin it? And is anything in her life so good that it's not worth risking in order to live a better life? Even if a therapist can't tell you how to get better, wouldn't just be nice to tell someone in confidence what you feel? Get it off your chest and have someone who can tell you that your perspective is valid?

Don't try to change her mind, just have these conversations so when she's ready, getting help will seem like a pretty natural thing to do. And when she's ready to go, make sure you're there supporting her every step of the way."

You deserve someone who will respect your boundaries. Being drunk is not an excuse. And WTF is he doing saying he wants a threesome, just not with you? It seems like common courtesy, when you enter a relationship, to assume that any sex you're having is with your partner.
