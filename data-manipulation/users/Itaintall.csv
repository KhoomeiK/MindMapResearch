TrueChristian,fesiz0z,t1_feshsql,1579365712.0,"I think you may have misunderstood me. I believe that in every gathering of believers, there is the probability of genuine, biblical, Christian fellowship, and man-made “religiosity”; focusing on the flavor of the man-made portion does not equip the seeker to navigate those waters. People tend to trust their religious leaders and believe what they teach without Pauline rigor in testing all things. My warning is not to flee man-made religion (he or she would have to forego all fellowship to do so), but rather to follow Christ, fellowship with His people, and to be on guard for the near certain man-made religion that will accompany it."

Much of what we consider to be “church history” is simple the history of these structures. I warn people to follow Christ, and not those structures whenever possible.

Once in Him, abide in Him, and allow Him to do the work He wishes to do in you. It becomes very little about your own effort. In fact, I’ve learned that if something seems hard as I “do it for the Lord”, I’m probably off on my own doing things He never intended for me."
