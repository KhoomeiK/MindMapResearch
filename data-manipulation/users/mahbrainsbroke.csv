offmychest,fdf3xdi,t3_ekuf7y,1578352739.0,"Genuine question. What can someone do to help? I haven’t personally said “prayers for Australia” I have tried not to read about it. It’s shameful but true Because I literally can’t do a single thing to help. I can send a dismal amount of money that I have to spare to whatever org and not even make a ding. I could literally go over there and throw water and I still wouldn’t make a difference. I’m from Illinois, thousands of miles away. I cannot do a single thing to help. It really sucks and it’s sad. I feel terrible for everyone in Australia and I would never even pretend to know how awful I assume it is over there right now but is there an actual legitimate way to help right now?"
MakeMeSuffer,fdf1z55,t1_fdf0u5x,1578351477.0,I never really understood the upvote and downvote purpose. I’ve also never made a comment with multiple emojis.

badwomensanatomy,fdexi3g,t1_fdewyx2,1578348682.0,Hm. Shows how invested in this convo I am.
badwomensanatomy,fdewi0t,t1_fdev1bg,1578348056.0,Well I wouldn’t say scouring. Within like one or two comments it was blatantly obvious you basically make negative comments on everything. It’s not insulting unless it’s true. You’re a mean person and clearly creep reddit to fight with people. You can claim I’m making a fool of myself but I’m simply calling you out for what you are.
Whatcouldgowrong,fdeqccl,t3_ekwg9x,1578344402.0,Wow. That was a wild ride from start to finish.
HumansBeingBros,fdeq8eo,t3_ekurn1,1578344338.0,These people are hero’s. The whole situation is so sad.
