I don’t know what your future career plans are, but unless it’s lined up and super specific and requires a specific degree, I don’t recommend post secondary education. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and although it took me on a very interesting journey, it is completely useless for my life today. 

If you do decide to continue with your current situation, ask your teacher to stop calling on you and don’t get guilted into attending class. Developing healthy boundaries around this sort of stuff is vital.

I have made a lot of progress in the last few years when I started educating myself about ptsd. It is my belief that agoraphobia is a ptsd symptom. There are a lot of people doing good research and developing therapies for ptsd these days. Basically, your nervous system is dysregulated. It is experiencing your environment as dangerous and telling your brain to get the fuck out of there. You can get the fuck out of there if you want, or you can take this opportunity to start rewiring your nervous system. Look into somatic trauma therapies. I personally do yoga as a way to repattern my physiology. There’s a lot to learn and discover and there and I wish you the best in your journey to create a lifestyle that works for you."

Agoraphobia,fehfpn1,t3_ep5h1i,1579115594.0,"I would suggest working with where you are at. First you need to take care of your physical health. If you can’t leave your room to go to the bathroom then you need to get a portable toilet to put in your room. You can get small discrete travel potties off of amazon or even just a bedpan. Bedpans were quite normal until recently. Also try to find a place to rent that is private. I know they are more expensive but sometimes it’s possible to find something unique and affordable. In the meantime, try to create an affirmation for yourself to repeat whenever you need to leave your room. Like “I have the right to walk down this hallway” or “I take care of my physical needs”.

I would like to suggest that you alter your thinking from “ive tried everything” to “there are so many possible therapies out there for me to get discover”. It’s true, in the big scheme of thing you may have only explored a small percentage. For example, I recently made a connection between ptsd symptoms/ agoraphobia and hormone imbalance. I’m getting to the point where I know what’s wrong with me and I know the difference between the cause and the symptoms and starting to take steps to create a life in which I can manage them. I would recommend doing some research into ptsd, dysregulation of the nervous system, and somatic body therapies. I feel suicidal sometimes too but it’s usually because I get stuck in fight or flight mode and once I realize this I can just tolerate it or so something to try to switch it off.

It’s a long and arduous journey but you have probably developed some internal resources along the way. Sometimes it feels hard to tap into and that’s okay. I think if you keep focused on the intention to heal, healing will come to you. Recently I had a big breakthrough when I realized that my ptsd symptoms are connected to horomone imbalance and I’ve started taking special herbs to regulate my horomones.

I’m 32 now and for the most part I’ve spent the past ten years trying to heal and figure out what’s wrong with me. Once I started learning about ptsd and specifically c-ptsd everything about who I am started making sense. My personal trauma is primarily due to emotional neglect. I recommend doing some research into trauma and see if it gives you a helpful paradigm to understand your suffering. From there I recommend researching somatic trauma therapy. These are therapies that support transformation through the body. Yoga is a perfect example of somatic therapy. It can heal the nervous system. It’s likely that you are stuck in fight or flight mode and believe it or not, breathing exercises can switch off flight or fight. I know from experience that breathing deeply is one of the hardest things to do sometimes. So basically what I’m saying is that, your struggles are likely due to a dysregulated nervous system that is stuck in on position. Hiding from everything and binge eating is a very natural response. Research different methods to heal the nervous system and that will put you in a better position to be able to address all of the symptoms. All the best to you."
