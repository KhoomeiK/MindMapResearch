They will never need you more.  Every small interaction with them is helping them learn and grow.  You are building the bonds that will lift them up and strengthen them through out the rest of their lives.  You are gentle giants that make them feel warm and protected at the most vulnerable time of their lives.

Remember that when things get tough until you do get to that magic moment."

SDAM,fdi3t1t,t3_elglhu,1578435235.0,"I have some memories that work on a trigger like that but those tend to be recent memories.  The further back the memories are the less likely that is to happen.

I do have some vague memories that I can recall from far in past without triggers but only a very few of those.

I don't know how my mind decides which memories to hang on to. Like I can remember the first person I ever had a sleepover with as a little girl. But I can't recall the memories I had of a best friend that I knew for years when I was just a bit older. 


Meeting her as a teenager was really embarrassing because everyone expected us to talk about how close were and I couldn't remember hardly anything. Just that there was a girl that I was friends with at that time that's all."

ffxiv,fdfzg6q,t3_el4mna,1578374641.0,Nice work!
SDAM,fdcwa4e,t3_ekjmpl,1578286160.0,"Because I can't visualize and recall visual memories, I'm terrible at facial recognition.  Then I was a little girl, my parents were close friends with a couple.  We interacted with then regularly.  Ted and Carol.  I knew those people were friends of our family.

We moved and didn't see them for a year.  Then one day I was walking home from school with a friend.  A couple drove up and said hi and asked me if I wanted a ride home.  I told them no.  My parents told me not to take rides from strangers.

It was only a year because I had stopped see them on a regular basis I couldn't people who were close friends of my family for years.

I was to young at time to think something was different but looking back it's one of incidents that stand out to me as proof that my mind works differently than most people.

It's also hell when trying to play MMOs.  I can't remember dungeon mechanics to save my character's life. Literally..."
