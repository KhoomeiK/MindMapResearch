OFC I have meds and that helps, but breakfasts supercharge my meds. Breakfasts help my body start the day creating the neurotransmitters I need, and my meds help me keep em around for longer. 

That being said it doesn't have to be a ""versus"" situation, you just plan your eating windows around breakfast no?"
fatlogic,fcwxcdd,t3_ej7nq4,1578041639.0,"Lol but breakfast IS important tho. Listen. Listen. I used to be a naysayer. But I've learned. If not for your weight, it's for your health. My brain is so much happier with a protein-heavy breakfast not just for my mood regulation but just general cerebral applications too. If you're neurodivergent having breakfast is a great aid in helping your brain make more of the neurotransmitters you don't get enough of. My mental health changed on breakfast. 

I'm not opposed to trying IF again in the future but by george my eating window will start in the morning and any fast will never go beyond 24 hours. I will plan my whole life around breakfast if I have to."

fatlogic,fcwwx6v,t1_fcwa61b,1578041117.0,"I think there's SOME merit to not being obsessed with a scale at least, or trying to achieve some nebulous number without considering your specific body type and genetics. 

But like, there's nuance. If you pin your self identity on losing weight and obsess over losing as much as possible no matter the method, then it might be best to ease back and focus on feeling healthy. But if you have a health plan and you're trying to track your progress then weight is a convenient measure of whether you're hitting your goals. 

I personally started being healthier by telling myself the scale doesn't exist, so that I'd pay more attention to how much healthier my body is, how much nicer I look or my improved mood. When I plateued, I reincorporated weighing so I could count calories, take care of macro ratios and keep the progress going. But by then I already taught myself that weight isn't the be all end all so I could just continue to do my thing without accidentally damaging my mental health. 

I'm not saying my way is ideal or will work for everyone, just saying that nuance matters. Which is why the extreme fat positivity stuff bothers me so much, it started from a pretty good place and then warped into dangerous assertions. HAES is a fantastic idea to encourage more people to try exercising without worrying that they don't 'look' like the right body type to do a thing. I love encouraging fat dancers or wrestlers for proving that your physical appearance doesn't mean you're doomed to never enjoy these activities, and technically doing them could IMPROVE your body. Like, everyone starts somewhere. But I stop short of hailing them as paragons of health, cause they're not."
fatlogic,fcww331,t3_ej6o9x,1578040060.0,"So I'm the kind of person that haaaaaates when someone comments on my weight and have sometimes lashed out about it in my fattest days. Yet when i go get a health check-up or whatevs I pretty much still just do it and take no offense when the doctor talks about my weight. Even my most impulsive overweight version of myself understood there's a difference. I'd rather an environment of polite candor from my healthcare professional, and it really isn't anything personal. Their opinion is good for me. I want them to be as informed as possible. 

Like it's literally just a few minutes afew times a year at most and then I can go home and go back to trying to not think about it, you can ""suffer"" that much."
