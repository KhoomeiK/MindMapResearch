Focus on what you want out of interpersonal relationships.

You and your girlfriend are having philosophical differences. Do we care more about intent or outcome? Here's the thing: it doesn't actually matter. The outcome is good (giving blood) and either the intention (getting a free health check) either doesn't matter if you only care about outcome or is also good, because society benefits when its members keep themselves healthy.

You are not taking away resources like free access to health care from others by doing this. You are not compromising the efficacy of the blood draw process. If charity were only done by the morally pure, not a lot of charity would ever get done.

Nothing in your post is explaining why you felt the need to make it. Did someone, like your mother, suggest you were a bad person or bad daughter for not prioritizing this language? This may be simply a personal insecurity.

Regardless, learning a language is a massive ordeal. If you can communicate reasonably well with your family members, that's all you owe them (for example, I would expect the family of a deaf child to learn sign language).

If you still feel bad, consider other ways you can interact with and celebrate this part of your heritage like cooking, clothing, stories, or a local craft. Language is part of culture, but there are other parts too that may not have the same drawbacks.

Everyone in the wedding party is a little nervous about their responsibilities and stage frightened. If OP would feel like this (a normal amount of discomfort) and refuses to suck it up for a cousin's special day, that's kinda TA. If OP has some unusual circumstances, then it is forgivable.

Considering the nature of the question: ""This thing may possibly happen at some point in the future and I'm very worried about the potential effects"" I wonder if there is an anxiety disorder."

It is not appropriate for you to decide how your brother should feel about or act in regards to your parents. You have different relationships with your parents. Consider that you don't know the full details of this relationship and, shockingly, your brother may actually have some valid ground to stand on.

You are acting dismissive of your brother's feelings and taking your parents' side without knowing the full story, completely disregarding the objective third party, the therapist *who also spoke with your mother and got both sides*.

Attempt to have a relationship with your brother that does not rely on your relationships with your parents, and stop acting like a third parent."

If it doesn't appear to be making people at your work feel weird (like they're being judged or something) then it's absolutely doing nothing to lower team morale. You just need to use your judgment about that, and it sounds as if you have.

If you are looking for a compromise, what do you wear casually on days you aren't scheduled? What did you wear to school? Do you tend to dress up on those days, as well?"

todayilearned,felai93,t1_fel9dfc,1579217641.0,"Only two of those articles are from reliable sources, and they talk about families suing hospitals, not that what the hospital did was wrong. Just because people who are grief-stricken sometimes act illogical and many laypeople don't understand the actual, medical definition of death doesn't mean there's some worldwide conspiracy to harvest organs.

Also, I don't know if you know this, but doctors are actually paid on a salary, not commission. So they wouldn't get extra money for this. If they hypothetically were by illegally selling the organs, that would be incredibly illegal and grounds for the medical community to immediately revoke their license.

Just because a death was 'disputed' doesn't mean it was disputed by people who actually know what they're talking about."
todayilearned,fela5f5,t1_fel2s7i,1579217413.0,There's no way the system would let a person with organs so unhealthy they require a transplant be allowed to be on the donor list themselves. Pretty easy to close this loophole.
todayilearned,fel9z8t,t1_fel1nm4,1579217304.0,"This is overly simplistic. The algorithm considers many factors, not just life expectancy.

todayilearned,fel9j8j,t1_fel3de7,1579217019.0,I think having received a transplant makes you ineligible to be a future living donor anyways.
