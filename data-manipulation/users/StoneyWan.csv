Why try to insult a fictional group of (suspected) peadophile president supporters to distract from your own peadophile sympathies?
Trump could openly admit to his links with every shady involvement and you'd STILL scream Clinton!

I dont think dressing the chimp would do anything as they have no concept of fashion or shame and would just be uncomfortable moving around in them.
They may be like 99% the same as us, but allot is contained in that 1%.
Apes neuro biology is completely different so speech is completely out of the question before you get to vocal chords.

It'll probably be a while yet, mid 20s till it all comes through, Trump will almost certainly win a second term.
