We all want that BFF feeling from high school or college, but long shifts at work, other relationships, chores and responsibilities mean that even your closest friend might only check in once a month.

It's not helped by the fact the people we spend the vast majority of time with are workmates, but they usually want to go home to their partners and real friends after a long work week, so the relationships remain superficial.

We're sold the idea of a close-knit group of friends and it certainly feels sometimes like ""everyone else"" has one of these.
