Take a look at this.
This is currently on the front page with 25,000 upvotes and 70 awards.
And, truthfully?
It's sickening.
This is a trend that I've noticed increasingly over the past year or two, and it's a deeply concerning one to me. People will take photos of, or record, incredibly intimate moments that should be kept completely private - the death of a loved one, a stepfather reacting to his stepchild asking him to adopt them, anything - and they plaster it online. The intent may be innocent, but it is incredibly disrespectful to the significance of those moments. The intimacy of them.
It's sickening that we're now at a stage where someone can be sitting next to their dying wife and think to themselves 'wow, better take a photo of my DYING FUCKING WIFE so I can put it on my social media account for internet points!
Shit, it's not even like it's a personal social media account like Facebook, where it might have some weight with family and friends. It's Reddit. You're broadcasting to total damn strangers.
You love your wife, I respect that. You want to immortalise your final moments with her, I understand that. What I don't respect or understand is you then plastering it online singularly so you can bump your karma a little bit. How do you think your wife would feel if she knew that in your final moments with her you were milking her as an upvote cow? Because even if that isn't the intent, even if it comes from a good place, that's what you are doing. Categorically. It's a sad picture and it gets sympathy upvotes.
These matters need to stay private. Elsewise, they lose the intimacy that makes them personal moments that you and your own can treasure.
Stop fucking plastering your dead family members over the internet. Peace.
