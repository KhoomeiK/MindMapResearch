bipolar,fejvtn7,t1_fejrvrh,1579187014.0,"Yup, so once you have ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù because your meds have made you stable they will yank your coverage thanks to new additional rules/restrictions they plan to add. This is being applied in targeted ways that have little to no oversight or research based justifications. It will also increase targeting of age groups (small children and the elderly) that are the most vulnerable."
bipolar,fejs0j9,t3_epjvci,1579184411.0,"The social security administration is attempting to reclassify and restructure the review and cancellation policy for disability benefits. Of the new classifications and review policies they are reclassifying bipolar as a new category called ‚Äúlikely to recover‚Äù, that will subject benefit recipients to frequent (a minimum of more than once every six months) case review for loss of benefits. This is a link to the government website for open comments about the proposal that go directly for review by the ssa."
Showerthoughts,feir6kc,t3_ep841n,1579145151.0,I wear a regular watch because when I‚Äôd check the time on my phone I‚Äôd end up checking my email etc... I found wearing a non-digital watch cut down my phone use and I kinda feel more like an adult for some reason.

explainlikeimfive,fe5b9l9,t1_fe4xn5l,1578867283.0,"Depends on what the context is I suppose. In academia it was English Language Learners (ELL) for a long time, but now the term emergent bilingual (or multilingual) (EB) is taking its place. In schools, at least in Florida, the course/designation is the course English for Speakers of Other languages, and has a level designation in the student‚Äôs profile of 1 (basically doesn‚Äôt speak English) to 5 (places out of ESOL). Ultimately, if you have the best interest of the student in mind and don‚Äôt view things from a deficit perspective any of the 1,000,000,000 terms out there work just fine unless you‚Äôre at a multicultural education or TESOL conference."
explainlikeimfive,fe2w0u1,t1_fe2obnv,1578843441.0,Also true for Florida‚Äôs emergent bilingual students who have ESOL accommodations (English for speakers of other languages).

bipolar2,fdrcx3e,t1_fdrb9e2,1578682677.0,"That has been such a damn struggle since I genuinely enjoy rye, bourbon, and pilsners. Not getting smashed, but just to have a nice toasty feeling. Then my meds increased and so much for alcohol. At this point I‚Äôve managed to get down to no more liquor, and maybe once a week nurse a Pilsner for an hour. Even the one beer is a questionable decision, but I haven‚Äôt managed to fully sacrifice something I love (at least I can still have pizza)."

rangers,fdqkxfo,t1_fdq8p9y,1578669150.0,"It is absurd, I used to see them with my buddy every time the played the Panthers for $30ish and when he moved by to NYC I was jealous he would get to see a bunch more games... he has seen zero over the past four seasons. I only get to go to a game with my mom around Thanksgiving time every year when I come up so the tickets in the 200‚Äôs become the most expensive gift I get. It‚Äôs nuts to me that opening night for the Panthers face value in the lower bowl is cheaper than obstructed by the bridge seats to a random game at The Garden. That being said,the experience of a game (fandom notwithstanding) at The Garden is unlike anything I‚Äôve experienced in Atlanta, NJ, South Florida, or Tampa,"

bipolar2,fd38d2t,t3_ejxkoq,1578155724.0,"Hi and welcome to the sub! This is a wonderful supportive space for folks with our diagnosis. The first thing to remember, and it‚Äôs a hard one to believe sometimes, is that you can still find success and happiness if you learn how to cope with the condition. I was diagnosed 17 years ago (wow that makes me feel old) and have managed over the years to not get hospitalized or go through with any of the darker impulses, have had a stable career, and am about to finish a Ph.D at a well regarded research university. 

The advice mentioned so far is on point about meds, mood journaling with apps (I had to use an actual journal back in 2003), and getting a regular sleep schedule. The family thing is also super important if you are lucky enough to have a supportive one. My family and close friends are one of the main reasons I managed to stay alive and out of the hospital because they either supported me when needed or gave me the heads up when things were starting to spiral. I also try to keep consistent with nutrition having similar healthy meals at consistent times, and before I hurt my foot I regularly ran/jogged. 

I suggest reading Marbles by Ellen Fourney. It‚Äôs a graphic novel style memoir of her diagnosis and learning to live with her illness, but you might not like it if your aren‚Äôt into indie style comics."

KeyforgeGame,fcrb8u7,t1_f88r8zd,1577899447.0,"Where in central PA? I can‚Äôt imagine there is much of a player base in the rural areas outside of Altoona or State College when school is in session who would be willing to drive 30/45 minutes to play an unfamiliar game. There might be a way to spark interest, but it would have to be really creative."

FloridaPanthers,fc9d8ok,t1_fc9cagq,1577550853.0,"He had no offers for a while until the Blackhawks were the only team to offer him a contract which was the one year deal. He said he would have taken less for a long term deal. The Blackhawks signed him for $5 to split time, but said last week (and reiterated last night) that he is now their #1 and will get the bulk of their next 7 games, which have no back to backs. Yes, Bob can start most games, but given his age and diminishing performance the past season or so, the 7 year $10 million was something no other team was willing to offer. Mind you, I am still happy they took a chance on a top tier goalie to try and be much better for the next couple of years, but it still hurts that Lehner is playing so much better.

Edit: nobody thought this would happen to Bob this year though, myself included. I was happy they swung for the fences and signed him and do have faith he will be better as the season progresses."
