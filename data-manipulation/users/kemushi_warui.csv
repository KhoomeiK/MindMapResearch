Bullshit. If true, they could have fleshed out the political aspect better. If anything, that was even more poorly resolved than the mystical side. They gave up on the whole thing all at once."

AskReddit,fdz91k0,t1_fdwbapo,1578787874.0,"I agree, except with the branch universe being fascinating. I think those threories cheapen the whole thing. 

The Last Temptation of Christ idea, i.e. that the whole movie is a kind of dream sequence that he's experiencing just as he's dying, is so much better--and frankly, it's also better supported by actual evidence in the movie.

If you think about all of the little details from the moment the engine drops to when we see Gretchen approach the house at the end, the narrative feels very dreamlike. For example, compare his family's reaction to thinking he was dead at the beginning--basically, ""Oh gee, there's Donnie. Huh, I guess he's not dead after all!"" (i.e. the sort of silly reactions you often get in a dream), vs. the truly heartbreaking reactions on the face of his parents to his real death at the end (i.e. the way people actually react in the real world).

If you think through other scenes in the movie, everyone, and every situation, is *always* just a little off throughout. For example, can you imagine a teacher saying ""sit next to the boy you think is cutest"" in the real world? or a psychiatrist being so matter-of-fact about a patient who is obviously troubled and possibly suicidal? or the whole silly FAA conspiracy thing, with man-in-black-type agents walking around? or the weird guy in the red track suit popping up? or the impossible damage done to the school? or any of the other weird coincidences--all of that is exactly the kind of slightly off-kilter kind of thing we experience in dreams, and perfectly sets up a framework to understand the movie.

The time-travel/save the universe/manipulated dead/whatever crap the director added to the DC is needless nonsense, and really cheapens a tight, otherwise interesting narrative."

I agree that the casting is on point, and it seems faithful to the tone of the Demon Bear story arc, which is a great introduction point to TNMs. 

My only quibble is that they missed an opportunity to make Sunspot black. With all the reconning that has gone on to add color to the MU, here you have an actual black character cast as a white guy for no apparent reason."
