DoesAnybodyElse,ffxwhs0,t3_evoovh,1580333795.0,"I was at Walgreens some years back in the cosmetic isle. While browsing, I kept hearing a popping sound. I looked the the right, and there was a man crouched down over the nail clipper bowl (it had, I’m guessing 50 nail clippers to be sold), clipping his fingernails. He obviously didn’t buy it, just wanted to clip his nails real quick. Sanitize anything that isn’t packaged. 
 Another story, but not about nail clipping, but about me shopping in a drug store. A girl, probably around 10 years old, was brushing her hair with a brush she just picked up with the tags on it. Sanitize anything that isn’t packaged. There‘s a bunch of nasty mofos out there."

When I have the nail trimmer in  my hand, I open and close them to making a snipping sound. They both come running towards me, meowing.  It‘s really cute. Then they get brushed, and one of them gets treats afterwards. My other cat doesn’t like treats."

Her favorite is when I wear a certain sweater, or my husband has on his bath robe. A couple of times she’s climbed up out of no where, without me being crouched down. She’s done this since she was a kitten. I can carry on about my business, and she stays on."
