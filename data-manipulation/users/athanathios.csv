rarepuppers,fffmgw1,t1_ffflzfv,1579887131.0,"Yup, she was livid, never saw he so pissed at me. It's funny how human dogs are and what a sense of fair play they have and justice and injustice. I recall her making a really funny noise as a puppy and my wife and I made fun of her and she was PISSEd similarly, barking at us to stop and doing little angry hops (which are Sooo cute)... it was so funny. Your Schnauzer sounds cute. My girl actually had a Schnauzer that's her enemy for a while, they get tense around each other.

She had a bout of aggression when she cracked a tooth and I think barked at her the wrong way. Now they are enemies. She was fine with another one that looked similar though LOL"
DogsMirin,fffm2xn,t3_etbi7o,1579886895.0,AWww Lucas is soo handsome! Please share him with /r/OldManDog they will love him to bits. I love him!

rarepuppers,fffl28h,t1_fffkeuc,1579886273.0,"That's cute, but glad you're so vigilant, I guess you're used to it, so keep those babies safe. My corgi is used to getting out of the way as she's so smol, so there's that. When I kicked her, it was my bad, I think I was looking to the side at a car and altered my path a bit into her. She actually does a really good job at avoiding stuff, thus her reaction was hilarious, she was literally barking at me, jumping up and down as we continued to walk, like a relative giving another relative heck, translated, I think she was say ""Watch out! You kicked me! Be Careful!""... by the time we could stop she had already forgotten about it and was just happy to walk. I wish we could be like dogs more and be more forgiving :)"

So she's always getting some pets on walks!

Your girl is oh so sweet, but certainly have to be on your toes with her :) So CUTE!"

rarepuppers,fffhf1b,t1_fffgvhl,1579884020.0,"Ya, same here, my girl tend to be longer than average (+5inches than the average female), so with her extra corgi length and personal length I don't think the K9 Sportsacks will suit her per se, the hunt continues :P"
DogAdvice,fffh91g,t3_etcfye,1579883916.0,"My dog as a puppy used to get an upset tummy and we always did mashed or boiled potatoes and some chicken cooked for her or just rice, depending on how her tummy is. As an adult she's much better, but as a baby her tummy could act up or her poop might not be 100%."
rarepuppers,fffh14v,t1_fffg2ot,1579883781.0,"One of her favorite things is to sit out back in the summer and get pets and cuddle right next to you (She's snuggly af). We just finished one of those this past summer, but she wasn't done, we were on our way out to walk and she just laid there giving me side eye until I told her to get up a couple of of time then she responded; she's knows exactly what she's doing. It's funny seeing her around friends and family,they know she's sweet, but she can be persistent and for most people who aren't firm she might get her way."

rarepuppers,fffd5ax,t1_fffcniv,1579881341.0,"LOL, training is a good thing we still do for sure, but she was a harder puppy to train, but she's very smart and tries to push us and fool us at times so took extra firmness at times. 

She's very well behaved overall, but has a strong personality. Corgis are great like that, such bosses in such small frames. She's my first dog too,so the learning curve was steep. She tried to train me at one point, so glad she's past that phase LOL"

rarepuppers,fffbm2e,t1_fffb0eh,1579880377.0,"Awww yes, dogs are so smart, we've been talking to my girl and it's amazing things she knows, like now, later, left and right, she even knows. Apologizing was one of those that just left me so happy because he was completely sweet. When I bumped her with my foot, she moved a bit and was like ""WATCH OUT"" with barks (a couple), but after you could tell she totally forgot about it. Just jumped up gave the sweetest kiss and moved on and wanted me to come along. Felt so happy at how sweet she was and it definitely strengthened our bond.

She's very sensitive too to other's moods, she knows if I'm busy and easily annoyed, so doesn't bother me too much. Her mom was sad, so spent time soothing her. Dogs understand a lot more and even the concept of fairness. 

Thanks for sharing your story, it's wonderful to get that from a dog and really makes them special. Dogs understand kindness and love well, so when in doubt give them that :)"

I knelt down and was very tender and hse was cool :) I think if I kicked her hard enough she would come at me, she's spunky LOL."
DogAdvice,fff6a9s,t3_et72pl,1579876795.0,"I have a similar situation in reverse with my puppy. I work and my wife's home. We chose the wildest corgi puppy of the litter too (my first dog to boot) and to boot I was the lesser experienced of the two (no dogs for me growing up, my wife had 2x labs). Anyhow it sounds like you need to do a TON of training, recall, etc, that really helped. Laying down the law is great. My issue with my dog is she wanted to boss me around, she realize initially I was a little hesitant, so had to step up. Longer sessions of training is a must. My girl is now 4 years old and we will give her a barrage of training now and again to make sure she's up to chops. Even last year she would act up sometimes, but she's a confident girl who likes to push boundaries. Keep up the good work and training really is key.

On thing did stick out, you come home from work, your dog get excited, but not with your husband who's @ home... well that's like us. She gets excited with me coming home and demands a certain amount of attention and play (I had some tech computer issues I was solving one day and couldn't play as much, so she was a bit sad at one point). But ya, my girl does that with me, so I think your dog might be excited for you to be around.

Good luck, honestly this sounds like stuff I went through. But from what I'm hearing your Pup is better behaved than mine was. My girl had ZERO chill until 9 months, then she kind of just chilled a bit and didn't need constant attention. 

Best of luck!"
rarepuppers,fff523b,t3_et9j03,1579875893.0,"The sweetest!

I accidentally kicked my corgi crossing the street once and she got all up in my face, notifying me to walk better. I felt bad, so when we stopped I bent down an apologized and gave her lots of pets and love and she jumped up and kissed my face as if to say ""it's ok, let's go"".

What was really nice was 2 years ago when my baby was just 2yo, I took Xmas off and it snowed a lot. I'm doing that this year, so hoping for lots of snow. We would go @ 11am to play snow fetch/soccer, she loved, the fields were empty too.

I learned this course to learn how to read key changes. Turns out you have to learn a ton of theory to get there. I've been geeking out on theory for a good couple years now, love it:

Meditation,ff92ypm,t1_ff910uc,1579703565.0,"Nope, this is dumb discussion, I'm not giving you more ammo to carry this on. The pose is a variation on Vajrasana, a non-cross legged, non-lotus position is much more common in the west, where chair sitting is a reality. I've been practicing for over half my life and if you can't wrap your head around the fact some people have called it the Burmese pose, I can't do much for you.

Most teachers who are quite learned, who I've learned from Ajahn Brahm and Thich Nhat Hanh, don't get caught up in names, give very basic instructions, if i've heard Vajrasana called Burmese go ahead. I gave you Gil Frondhal's site as a link, that's where I learned the name. I learned from him as well.
