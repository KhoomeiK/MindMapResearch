First is that climate change isnt due to what happens this year it's what's happened over the past hundred years. And the US blows China out of the water in that respect.

science,fdllglt,t1_fdlhlos,1578526698.0,"I think you may have been loose with your program names there.  

SSDI is not in the same category as Medicare and Medicaid as it is not a health insurance program. And in a manner it is means tested as you must have a history of employment income where you paid in a minimum of quarters towards social security taxes. People, for example, who are born with a disability and therefore can't work don't qualify for SSDI. Those people qualify for the much more meager SSI program.

First is that climate change isnt due to what happens this year it's what's happened over the past hundred years. And the US blows China out of the water in that respect. Telling a developing country that us going through the exact same emission boom we did 60 years ago that they can't do the exact same thing we did to develop our econo.y is not an apple to Apple fair comparison.

science,fdllglt,t1_fdlhlos,1578526698.0,"I think you may have been loose with your program names there.  

SSDI is not in the same category as Medicare and Medicaid as it is not a health insurance program. And in a manner it is means tested as you must have a history of employment income where you paid in a minimum of quarters towards social security taxes. People, for example, who are born with a disability and therefore can't work don't qualify for SSDI. Those people qualify for the much more meager SSI program. 
Anyway, what I said was accurate. Medicaid is a program for those in poverty or near poverty so if you are uninsured and have a significant health condition you must place yourself in a position of poverty before you can get that insurance. That's not a good safety net."
