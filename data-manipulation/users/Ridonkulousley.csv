Charleston,ffeyhvw,t1_ffdq4lp,1579870426.0,"Oil change is $0.01-$0.03 a mile
Tires are $0.03-$0.06 a mile.
Assuming 150,000 miles a $50,000 car has a depreciation of $0.33/mile. 
$3.00/gal @ 25mpg is $0.12/mile

So on the high side $0.57/mile in depreciation (for those factors). 

No idea what they get paid but likely enough more than that to make it worth doing."
