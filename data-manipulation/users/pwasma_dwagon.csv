Aside from that, it's all macro macro macro. Most tutorials would focus, since the launch of the game, on teaching the right build order for the right situation. It has always been the basis upon which you build your skills.

Once you have your timings properly, micro comes in to flesh out your strategy even more.

We all knew apm wasnt the winning factor, but once you get too good it becomes an instrumental part of success. Stalemates are many times defined in a second because of proper positioning. Splitting your infantry to prevent splash damage can turn the tide of battle. Spying and keeping tabs on your opponent let's you split their forces or know when and where to attack.
