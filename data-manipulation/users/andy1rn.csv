BattleBreakers,ffcg6fp,t3_esljyt,1579798759.0,"zAndy1RN

level 150 Ramirez. Still figuring things out, active player."
BattleBreakers,ffca3x4,t3_estkk9,1579794984.0,"How do I get Ramirez from 5 stars to 6? Her level is 150, she's +10, can't drink any more elixors and gear is maxed. Fully evolved. Is there anything else? My account level is 219 if that matters. Thanks in advance for any replies!"
BattleBreakers,ffb0kxh,t3_eskpn3,1579748831.0,zAndy1RN  -  happy to see what Gifting is all about!
BattleBreakers,ff9ompc,t3_es4end,1579717398.0,"Clearly still bugged, extreme under-delivery -- but I got ***something***, so hoping it is a good start."
BattleBreakers,ff91u4e,t1_ff85j1f,1579702746.0,"Think I got more than that, but not much more. I was just shocked to see a chest splash page that said 'friend gift' after all this time and so many emails back and forth with Epic."
BattleBreakers,ff7sa08,t1_ff7rdmt,1579657129.0,A lot of folks on my friend's list are active too. Just got excited to get anything at all.
FORTnITE,fezhqtd,t1_fez3jkt,1579457465.0,"Dang - I had no idea. I'll use my pickaxe when I have Stonewood or Plankerton missions, I guess."
FORTnITE,feyz4ki,t1_feyty6s,1579452289.0,Unless they changed it (possible) it doesn't work this way. Yet.
FORTnITE,feyz1te,t3_eqvnm9,1579452258.0,"Since when does everyone not get the vBucks? Thought everyone got exactly the same stuff, regardless of how much combat damage they do."
wholesomememes,fetnkpx,t1_fesi4oe,1579377253.0,">my mom can always get love from my little bro

So much not the same thing. Not to dis your bro, but he *can't* heal the wound you'd leave behind. Wait it out, see if you do something for someone else, even a tiny thing."
wholesomememes,fetn8i5,t1_fes5519,1579377113.0,">The world is better with you in it 

Applies to you, too. More people care than you know. See if there's a way you can help someone else. And what u/Fifsn said!"
wholesomememes,fetmzvv,t1_fest0i0,1579377018.0,"Honest? Give yourself time, when you can - try to help others. It gets your head away from how bad you feel. Let friends and family know you care about them. Sometimes the lack of energy keeps us alive. It does get better. Try to wait it out. A lot of strangers here are pulling for you."
wholesomememes,fetmibf,t1_fetb5xy,1579376864.0,"Sincerely hope things are better now. Love on that pup a little extra, from me and mine. Also treats.  ;)"
BattleBreakers,feszbej,t3_eqj8up,1579370414.0,Commenting so I can find your post again. GREAT question.
lifehacks,fesyerz,t1_fersveq,1579370129.0,"Upvoted for pizazz. Also, great idea - no more peeling my fingers by mistake."
FORTnITE,fes65ct,t1_ferxcox,1579361856.0,"Don't think he's turning away as much as waiting for Epic to fix it. The guy is a realist, but always optimistic and credits Epic with working hard."
BattleBreakers,fes4fsd,t3_eqgrtr,1579361320.0,"Okay, in the category of things I should already know probably: 

When heroes in the front row are on cool down, do the enemies have a free pass to smack someone in the back row? 

I hadn't thought it worked that way, but several times a superboss has one-hit someone in the back row while the front row hero was on cooldown. Basically I just repeated myself."
lifehacks,fep5spn,t1_feotpfb,1579312770.0,"Looks like they're braiding it, same as basic (3-strand) hair braid. The loose end pulls snug at the end, keeping it from falling apart."
FORTnITE,fegvakl,t1_fegezyz,1579103328.0,So I guess you're a vet now. Congrats!
FORTnITE,fegv7wg,t1_fegqcj3,1579103281.0,"Magyst, I feel for you. You're trying and I really appreciate that. Can you convince anyone that you seriously need MUCH better play testing before releasing updates? A whole bunch of people here would be delighted to help. Give us something to do, and help reduce the level of frustration."
FORTnITE,feguwq5,t1_fegutte,1579103082.0,Maybe I'd be less annoyed if I hadn't convinced 2 friends to buy the game since it went on sale. I think I owe them some money now.
FORTnITE,fegutte,t1_fegq5lf,1579103031.0,"It's not even on Trello today. Apparently we're imagining it. It's not a real issue.  /s   - maybe I should apologize, but I keep TRYING to come back to StW, after a month now this same thing is happening only worse. I quit a level 70 Ride the Lightning mission after freezing (for roughly 5-10 seconds) FOUR times in less than 2 minutes. No one else was in the game, there was not a lot of floor litter. 

smh"
FORTnITE,fegowvv,t1_fegoini,1579099047.0,"If so, perhaps Epic could invest 0.1% of the money spent on Fortnite BR to buy separate servers for them. BR surely won't complain about getting new servers, and it'll leave ours in peace. In grumpy old man voice: ""Get off my lawn!"""
FORTnITE,fefyi73,t1_fefjq81,1579069525.0,"Can't crouch in StW, only in BR. You can duck behind things though -- well, stand behind them anyway."
FORTnITE,fefy71w,t3_eoygsb,1579069198.0,Fix the lag spikes that are keeping me from having fun.    Thank you.
FORTnITE,fee3vl2,t1_fee3mgy,1579025853.0,"Odd that the message/chat seems to go through, while I can't move - then \*zap\* I'm 10 feet from where I thought I was, with stupid monsters grinning at me. Yep, not playing until that gets better."

BattleBreakers,fe8mevz,t1_fe6hnvg,1578927906.0,"Thanks, this is exactly what I was trying to figure out."
BattleBreakers,fe5vmp6,t1_fdw2l0n,1578875951.0,"As of today he's in the hero store. Based on comments, I think I'd better pick him up."
BattleBreakers,fe5t8mk,t3_enq5u1,1578874430.0,Does anyone get Friend Gifts? I thought only some of us were bugged.
BattleBreakers,fe5syxb,t3_ennvgv,1578874263.0,"Pet question: Can I use more than one of the same pet in a game? 

I am short on green pets, and there's a green sneek available. I already have one if I buy a second, can I use it after the first one dies in a game? If so, I think I want multiple sneeks for mana replacement."
wholesomememes,fe5iolg,t1_fe4dl1e,1578869949.0,Ouch

Also in game under 'social' at top right is a link to the discord group. On left side of *that* is a clickable link to 'find friends' or some such.

And a Facebook group  [https://www.facebook.com/groups/Battlebreakers07/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Battlebreakers07/)   with about 90 active & pretty friendly members."
FortniteSavetheWorld,fdlhhsu,t1_fdkemxi,1578524126.0,Interesting. Good thing you can't drop legendary perk-up or I'd hit you up. That impressed me more than the collection book.
BattleBreakers,fdie4yl,t1_fdidqdu,1578440850.0,"Thanks, I thought it would make more difference than that. After reading your comment I decided to foil Ramirez, but oops! turns out I have no foil.   XD"
MadeMeSmile,fdiamwg,t3_elbih0,1578438755.0,More like lone Floof.
BattleBreakers,fdi8bxs,t3_elbzm0,1578437544.0,"I've heard that foil heroes give more xp in the pit when you level them. Anyone have more specific information? Is it best to foil your rarest pit heroes? Does it matter if they're at level 1 when you foil them, or at level 90 (i.e. are any xp boosts retroactive)?"
wholesomememes,fdi6nd3,t3_elfwsd,1578436678.0,This is exactly how having two dogs works.
BattleBreakers,fdcy6qz,t3_ekoquq,1578287819.0,"Saw this last night, it had 2 keys in it. I thought maybe it was Friend Gift working? Obviously just guessing (and optimistic)."

Borderlands2,fdbrezi,t3_ekglsz,1578260815.0,Beautiful work.
MadeMeSmile,fda2rin,t1_fd91hzw,1578241019.0,Removing my comment in the honest hope most people here are trolling and I bit.
MadeMeSmile,fda2ajh,t1_fd7lp2j,1578240842.0,Not even close to the same thing. Pretty much cutting a fingernail vs amputating the finger. Look it up.
theouterworlds,fd6vr67,t3_ejvjnb,1578196340.0,Where is this? Did I miss it or forget about it?
theouterworlds,fd6v0qt,t3_ek5pj1,1578196066.0,"Mostly when I get back on the ship I head for the workbench, by where Parvati hangs out just to see what they're up to."
theouterworlds,fd6tltg,t3_ek3aty,1578195546.0,Had no idea Ashly Burch voiced Parvati until the end credits. Gonna have to hope she keeps voice acting for many years.
BattleBreakers,fcyl45w,t3_ejhg9y,1578081995.0,"zAndy1rn, have Rescue Trooper Ramirez at level 142; working on getting what she needs to finish leveling.
