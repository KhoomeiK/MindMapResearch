todayilearned,fgl1n39,t1_fgilgiw,1580879241.0,That's exactly what he is. Victimizing another person to atone for more than likely victimizing someone else? Selfish.
todayilearned,fgl16m5,t1_fgl12mq,1580878859.0,You're using it and keeping it popular. You can leave me alone now. Thanks. I reread your comment and had more to say. Sorry I didn't ask your permission to add to my comment. Bye.

todayilearned,fgl04mo,t1_fgkrw90,1580878009.0,As another woman... Most old men would put up with that. It's not an indicator. The BIGGEST assholes will be sweet as pie to younger women. It's just a thing.

politics,fgkxg93,t1_fgktud4,1580875944.0,That was when everyone still hated gay people. Democrats championing lgbtq rights drove one of the largest wedges between Democrats I think. Many probably went over to the other side in the mid 90s and never looked back. So basically I think it was a little easier back then personally. Don't ask don't tell was bs too so...
politics,fgkwovj,t1_fgkw2vj,1580875394.0,"I don't get this argument. Have you seen Republicans for the last three years? You think THIS is going to make everyone convinced that Democrats are equally as bad in that regard? They've been beat up about not being tough enough, but suddenly a little display of anger and it's all over? I want to see them get angry but this is literally one example. Stop it with the alarmism. I'm just glad to see a little emotion from pelosi really."
politics,fgkwjtg,t1_fgkw3t8,1580875294.0,"Dems do one thing that goes against character, \*pearl grasp\* ""the Dems are antagonizing! Republicans act like regunant, mean spirited children; per usual. ""They're playing 3d chess!""

If the Democrats are stoic and follow tradition they get called weak... There's a certain group of people who you can never ever make happy. Those people have no clue who they're going to vote for til they hit the ballot box. They're not even worth courting."

news,fgkgrbt,t1_fgkb95l,1580865195.0,"Says the guy who's basing his entire opinion on his little snowflake feelings that are uninformed. Fuck off you ignorant bigot. Sexual reassignment surgery has been being performed for close to 100 years at this point. It's been an option for as long as trans people have been around and medical science could provide it. Its existence and it's acceptance has grown organically over time based on evidence and practice. People have been getting the surgery for a century dude. A century. But you, having done zero research, having read nothing of value, having ignored and denied the opinions of people who've spent their lives researching this, think your opinion (feelings, let's be honest) counts, you think it's valid! Lulz. It is not valid. That's my last word on it snowflake."
news,fgjr6gz,t1_fgjo86p,1580849785.0,I wasn't aware that you ran a psychiatric or medical organization staffed with medical professionals that rivals the ama or the apa. Fucking idiot. I'm sorry but people like you who just pop off and defy literal 100s of years of expertise piss me off. People need to know that you're full of shit and that your opinion doesn't matter.
