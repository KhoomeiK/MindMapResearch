lawofattraction,ffsw0kj,t1_ffsut80,1580194726.0,"Keep an open mind, take in all you can. Take note of things which pop out and strike you as interesting. 

For example, read as much / watch YouTube for different LOA/ spiritual teachers. As you do, certain concepts will ring true and you will be able to integrate those parts you see as true into yourself. 

There is nobody who will have ""the answer"" to what you seek. Following one belief based on another's truth will limit you. The truth is inside you already, you just need to recognize it. 

If you want you can accept what another person says is the truth, but if it's not ringing true in your heart,  it won't come easy. 

It sounds like you're not a big fan of money/ material things. There's many schools which focus on other things such as happiness,  service to others,  service to self, etc. 

You can just search things like LOA and find many teachers all with different approaches. From there you may even move into the law of one and other aspects of spirituality."

I myself have had third eye experiences,  but have only really worked my third eye. Lately I've been trying to balance myself and work the rest of my energy centers as I've discovered on my journey that I've neglected those parts of my life and it has caused a lot of my issues. Slowly it's working."
spirituality,ffh7h7d,t3_etecug,1579925274.0,"I am experiencing similar things. My body always seems to be humming with energy, that I can amplify if I focus.  I can sense my pulse and other bodily rhythms. I also sense the world around me as if seeing it with something other than my eyes. This also gives me the sensation that I'm seeing in 360(not with the eyes) even with my eyes closed.

 Sometimes my hearing picks up stuff really clear far away and I get a ringing in my ears that grows in intensity just before an answer I am seeking comes to me, like a game of hot/cold. It is disorienting some times. 

These things are hard to explain to a non seeker, but I get you. You're transcending 3D, keep seeking, you're on the right path."
