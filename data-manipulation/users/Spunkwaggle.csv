BigBrother,fejhf94,t1_feipxgy,1579174381.0,"No one validated Michelle’s hate.  Michelle accused Nicole of floating on the week Nicole won hoh.  Nicole personally sent Michelle packing after a tie vote. Michelle voted for Paul to win and Nicole won anyway.  For all her targeted hatred, that was justice."
BigBrother,fehx71r,t1_fehwo5p,1579125649.0,Whoops.
BigBrother,feht2m2,t1_fehki6f,1579123316.0,Voted down for giving the real fact.  Michelle voted for Paul. your downvote doesn't magically change history.  It just means you can't deal with the facts.
wholesomememes,fehsouo,t3_ep5sj7,1579123100.0,When did Phil the Malamute get turned into a meme?  This is the second time I've seen him.
BigBrother,fehl0ds,t3_ep1hb1,1579118686.0,"Here's one people will have brushed over and largely forgotten.  It's not the biggest, but I'm going to put it here with the rest of these anyway b/c I am curious what other people's thoughts are.

Michelle's white hot rage obsession with hating Nicole.

She even voted for Paul to win she hated Nicole so much.  To this day, there is no solid answer on why.  We were left to conjecture that Michelle thought Nicole had too good of a game and would win if she was allowed to get too far?  She was jealous?  She was intimidated by Nicole's social play and being Cody's cuddle buddy in s16?  Some combination of the above?  Whatever it was, she had total blinders on toward Nicole.

It was nice to see Michelle get ignored completely when she tried to spread the hate, and even didn't get her way when she voted for Paul to win.

Edit:  Thanks for the downvote, Michelle.  Your displeasure is noted.  lol"
BigBrother,fehki6f,t1_feh01c3,1579118394.0,"Michelle voted for Paul.  By game's end, her dislike for Paul had died down to almost indifference, while her epic obsession with hating Nicole was still in full inferno mode.  lol  

I thought it was fitting karma that her hate for Nicole didn't get validated a single time, not even in the final vote."
BigBrother,fehk5e3,t1_fegxgrc,1579118192.0,"Nah, I would disagree with the hands down bit.  She's not the first person to do that.  Hell, Bayleigh did it to her own team mate and biggest supporter while HoH, then had an emotional breakdown after her sky came tumbling down on her by everyone turning on her the week after."
BigBrother,fehju2i,t1_fegs8pe,1579118011.0,Yyyyup.  Bayleigh was behaving like a grade A nasty biatch.  Getting so upset that she broke down was some justice all on its own.
BigBrother,fehj33y,t1_fegrv4f,1579117570.0,"Or that could be called, ... like ... playing the game."
BigBrother,fehis8s,t1_fegq6lf,1579117393.0,"Thank You!  Paul didn't treat people like shit, he just played the game and manipulated.  Alex told them all on finale night that he had laughed at them and called them morons and idiots for trusting him behind their backs when that was actually a lie, she was the one who called them all morons and idiots while she was still in the game, believing she was the only one he was really working with.  She went all hell hath no fury on finale night because she knew how stupid she looked laughing at the other players and calling them idiots and she turned out to be one of the ones that was played right along with them.  She got so fired up about it, she lied to them to make them flip against Paul by telling them that.  He never actually said any of it.  The only thing he ever said while in the diary room was he couldn't believe they hadn't voted him out.  He was too busy playing the balance diplomat game at all times to stop and gloat about how he was doing.  So wasn't his behavior that made them salty, it was Alex's lie."

Grinds my nerves that ppl let their cats take the dogs beds and just laugh at their dog being too domesticated and nice, (like they were bred to do) to do anything about it.  And peeing on the dog’s bed is a new level of “mine!  Do something about it”."
