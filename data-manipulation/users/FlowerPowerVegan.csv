I was directing Werner with the puppet, and Werner had just fallen in love with the baby.

His force use seems to be used instinctively to protect - the major incidents occurring when he and/or Mando were in eminent danger plus he seems to have a far greater natural inclination to heal the injured. But in his mind there was likely no difference between the mudhorn and Cara, since he was only reacting to the (perceived) threat to Mando.
