One non-environmental evolutionary pressure might be from predators. Any adaptation that helps an individual survive predators will get passed on, and the offspring will be better able to survive predators. This can be anything from improved senses, to less vulnerable physical characteristics (perhaps speed or tough skin), to just having a lot more offspring so that some of them will survive.

assassinscreed,feo5lv7,t3_eq1kas,1579295429.0,"It's obvious from the responses that this is a completely subjective choice. I like Kassandra because I found more variety in her voice, while I thought Alexios was somewhat one-note. Also, I agree with OP that the animations for Kassandra seem more polished. One thing I specifically noticed, as I paid close attention to it, was that her facial expressions show a lot more nuance. I'm not sure whether that's down to the performance or to the artists translating performance capture to animation.

You can tell the difference even before you leave Kephallonia (all these examples are from very early in the game, so no spoilers). Look closely at the facial reaction to the Cyclops thugs saying ""Hey shitface!"" right at the start of the game. Alexios just looks angry, but Kassandra's expression shows a mixture of surprise, disgust and anger, based on the way her eyes are animated.

If you give the woman who fixes your bow a ""be patient"" response, Kassandra takes a much gentler, more reassuring tone to calm the woman than Alexios.

Later, before Phoibe tells the *misthios* about her friend in the village across the island, Phoibe makes a sarcastic comment and Kassandra's face just for a moment shows an ""oh please"" reaction with a hint of a squint that is missing from Alexios' animation.

There are countless other examples in the game, but the fact that the animators went all out with Kassandra's emotional aspect makes it more rewarding for me. Also, male Diemos is an awesome antagonist, all macho bluster, just as you would expect from a dude who has been raised from birth to believe he is a demigod."

assassinscreed,feiw07i,t1_feihmzn,1579148729.0,"The short answer to your question is that the health and damage numbers are asymmetrical because that helps the designers make combat more fun.

The rules *are* different for PCs and NPCs. This is not a table top roleplaying game (obviously) though it may have superficial similarities. Players are at a disadvantage compared to a table top game, because they must react in real time to enemies that have perfect knowledge of every element of combat and instantaneous reaction time.

Enemies with more health give the designer more of a range of possible attacks for the player. If the player is to have small damage over time effects all the way up to multiple hard hitting strikes in a single attack, enemies have to have enough health to accommodate all those different tactics. The player can not have a similar large amount of health, because enemies don't have the same range of damaging attacks. If they did, the player would be at a severe disadvantage, particularly when facing enemies higher level than the player.

At the risk of seeming glib... If the numbers bother you, there is an option to turn them off, and you can also turn off enemy health and level displays.

I honestly don't mean that to be dismissive, it's just an option."

assassinscreed,fei1b7q,t1_fehzpse,1579128119.0,"You mentioned that doing a critical assassination only scratches the surface of your target's life pool, but that is not the case. A single critical assassination strike from behind will kill any enemy unless your character is not built or equipped for assassination, or your enemy is a special enemy (assassination resistant, mythcial or other boss).

The reason enemies can take more damage than you is that you have means of doing damage that they don't. You do more damage with your regular attacks as you level up and get better gear, yes. But you can also do a lot of extra damage with overpower attacks, boosted fire and poison DOTs, predator shots, hero strikes, critical assassinations, and so on. If enemies had smaller health pools, you wouldn't need any of those attacks. You'd have fewer options in combat and fewer ways to develop your character, so combat and character builds would be much less interesting.

Having enemies able to take more damage gives the game designer more leeway in creating different ways the player can do damage with a variety of attacks: burst damage, attacks that get increasingly powerful, specializing in critical strikes, damage over time, and so on. Each of those kinds of attacks do different amounts of damage, so to make them all feasible, the enemy needs enough health that the player can use a variety of tactics. Weapons do different amounts of damage, too, so a balance must be struck between weapon power, attack speed, whether the enemy can break an attack chain, whether a specific weapon has a special finisher, all that sort of thing."

As far as assassinations not assassinating, if you want to play that way, you must build your character to do so. There are many examples of assassin builds only a web search away.  You might also consider dropping the difficulty a bit. Higher difficulties are designed to make combat more challenging for warrior focused players.

Many of the same teams that contributed to Odyssey are also contributing to the next game. While the game director is a key person in the production, they are only one person. Every member of every team has to be outstanding for the game to be outstanding.

As for your other points, I'm weary of the same opinionated complaints being dragged out again and again as facts. Odyssey is full of both outstanding stories and quick & dirty stories. That is by design. The quick & dirty stories are for people who just want quest XP. The more involved stories are for people who want to explore the world and meet some interesting characters. Nearly every island in Odyssey has an extended quest line that illuminates part of the Greek world, or is dramatic, or just silly fun.

Odyssey's environment is full of variety, from forests (deciduous and coniferous), to scrub lands, to rocky plains, to granite cliffs, volcanic islands, mountain ranges, fertile plains covered in farms, even an arid desert-like environment in parts of Krete. Each big city has its own personality - the sprawling metropolis of distinct neighborhoods of Athens; the towering Arokorinth of Korinth; the winding narrow streets of Sparta, punctuated by military parade grounds; the shipyards and naval atmosphere of Patrai; the walled majesty of Argos; the wide, tree-lined roads of Thebes; the festive atmosphere of the Sanctuary of Olympia in Elis.

If there doesn't seem to be much variety in the bandit or military camps, well, perhaps that is because there are so many of them. Again, by design, so that players who like that activity can get their fill. Origins had its share of samey bandit groups, too. Odyssey has bandits and cultists that live in wooden-stake walled camps, forest clearings with minimal fortification, ancient ruins, caves, and any combination of those you care to make. A lot of the common features among camps are to make the layout familiar to players, so they can tell at a glance what their approach should be.

Forts have similarities, but each is still a unique setting, with multiple approaches, unique patrols and archer positions, some with prisoners, some without. But they're all full of chests and piles of cash, because that's what forts are about. Looting stuff.

What's more, each of these camps, ruins, forest clearings, forts, and towers have different populations based on both the difficulty of the game and the level of the player or environment. Early on, you won't see many elite, hard-hitting, healthy enemies (unless you're playing on nightmare). Later, forts will be filled with brutes, elites, elite brutes, captains, and all of them have moves that aren't used by their lower level counterparts.

assassinscreed,fed12bp,t1_feckuk6,1578993342.0,"What you proved is that people say the player has to do side quests. Certainly not ALL side quests, and certainly not before doing any story quests (except a couple people in the comments of one thread - I guess a few people save the main quest for last, but those sick deviants are not “everyone”). The exaggeration is what I object to. It is not unreasonable to design an RPG to require some exploration and some side stories that help define the setting. More on that in a moment...

I’m bothered by exaggeration that makes people who enjoy the game seem unreasonable, and I’m bothered by the claim that ALL the side quests are garbage. Many of them are well constructed and enhance the story. The difficulty is that there are a LOT of repetitive throwaway quests, but some people look at those and assume all the side quests are the same. Even the throwaway quests are there for a reason, though. Some players want to level up to have more abilities and more options when playing the main story, and short one-shot quests are the quickest way to do that. 

Complaining about having to do side quests in an RPG is like complaining about having to juggle loot in a looter shooter. It’s part of the game. In an RPG, it’s how the designers draw you into the world and get you invested in your character. The difference between Odyssey and Origins and the earlier games is that in the earlier games, we played a character some writer created. In Odyssey (and Origins to a lesser extent), each player can play the character the way they want. A big part of that is providing optional content that the player can choose from while choosing how their version of the character acts in the quests they choose to do. 

These options exist not to provide branching story paths, but to let each player imagine their own Alexios or Kassandra. Role playing."

MiniMotorways,fdlmras,t1_fdllrts,1578527546.0,"I meant that to be actual advice, not ranty or snarky. Sorry if I came off that way. It looks to me like too many roads is the primary problem with your map. It's much better to let the map grow organically rather than trying to be clever with grids or roads blocking new buildings. When I stopped trying to control the map, my usual score went up by several hundred points, and I recently got my first few scores over a thousand."

aww,fdihui1,t1_fdi1up6,1578443254.0,"It's really weird to read that sentiment because I always felt that way whenever I played an instrument. It's hard to describe to someone who has never done it. The way I always described it was that I never really felt like I was playing music, it was more like the music was playing me. I know that sounds really corny but it's true.

 I wrote and arranged a few pieces when I was younger and I felt the same way about writing music. I never felt like I was creating it, more like I was just putting down what was already there, but only I could hear it.

Sadly, when it came time for college, my parents talked me out of pursuing a music degree, convincing me that more practical studies would be better for me. Now I am nearly 60, and I often wonder about the path not taken. My mother tells me now that not encouraging me to study music was one of her greatest regrets. Over the years she has heard so much music that sounds like what I used to do just noodling around on the piano.

No regrets for me, though, I had a very rewarding tech career."

Not that anyone ever listened, but I have always held that the entirety of ME3 is the “ending.” Yours is one more example of why that is the case. Cheers, and enjoy your 26th through 50th trilogy runs!"
