I definitely agree with you that the laws don't mean anything if theyre not enforced or if criminals can bribe their way out of them. I am VERY glad that I don't live in China for several reasons, mostly regarding free speech, freedom of the press.

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Adopted by the Second Session of the Fifth National People's Congress on July 1, 1979 and amended by the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on March 14, 1997:

""A negligent crime occurs when one should foresee that one's act may cause socially dangerous consequences but fails to do so because of carelessness or, having foreseen the consequences, readily assumes he can prevent them, with the result that these consequences occur.""

Chapter II   Crimes of Endangering Public Security

Article 114.   Whoever endangers public security by setting fires, breaching dikes, causing explosions, administering poison; or employing other dangerous means to sabotage factories, mines, oilfields, seaports, rivers, water sources, warehouses, dwellings, forests, farms, threshing grounds, ranches, important pipelines, public buildings, and other public and private property is to be sentenced to not less than three years but not more than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment in cases where serious consequences have not been caused.

Article 115.   Whoever sets fire, breaches dikes, causes explosions, and spreads poison; employs other dangerous means that lead to serious injuries or death; or causes public or private property major losses is to be sentenced to not less than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death.

Whoever commits the crimes in the preceding paragraph negligently is to be sentenced to not less than three years to not more than seven years of fixed-term imprisonment; or not more than three years of fixed-term imprisonment, or criminal detention, when circumstances are relatively minor."
