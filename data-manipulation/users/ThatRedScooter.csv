I know arranged marriages can never really be 100% truthful because you don't want to share your past and they don't want to share theirs but why even bother marrying in that case?

On the day I left my home country, I was wearing a pretty frock and lounging about when my dog wanted to go for a walk. My mom told me I was to cover up before I left or not go at all. I chose not to go; found the shortest skirt in my closet and packed it. 

I've never been one to show off any cleavage. But I have started to in the last few months. I look at myself in the mirror and tell me how good I look in certain colours, styles of clothing.
Wear what you're most comfortable in. 

Key advice: your ""flaws"" are only visible to you. Nobody else can see them. Just like nobody could see my belly flab, my tiger stripe-y butt or arm flab. 

Confidence is definitely the most important accessory. If you think you look good, you will. Walk straighter and smile at everyone. You'll find yourself in a better mood, more approachable and definitely more attractive. If you don't want to start off with something extreme, wear a skirt with a slit. And go from there.

I might dislike the person not telling me about it before I ate it, but I wouldn't make a big deal about it affecting my health. Just about not taking my choices into consideration.

Hear me out. I boil my cup too. But not in a kettle. In a pot where I can keep an eye on it because you should absolutely not let it boil unattended!

That being said, the cup actually gets quite clean from a thorough rinse and the sterilisation is just an added measure. It doesn't exactly leech out any body fluids, if you know what I mean. 

It is alright to boil the cup but again, not unattended and maybe in something that is easier to rinse out. I definitely don't leave the cup in the water I boil it in because... That kind of defeats the purpose of sterilising it in the first place. 

She is in the right to want to sterilise it using kitchen equipment because like I said, it's not ""dirty"" exactly (if she rinses it out thoroughly including a thorough check of the tiny holes given for the suction). BUT you're not TA either for not wanting to find the cup just floating around in the kettle. It NEEDS to be removed from the boiling water when it is done boiling. Leaving it lying around in the water could cause more harm than good. 

Get her a pot to do this in. It's easier to clean, it's better to keep an eye on and make sure the cup doesn't touch the sides or melt."

He would bully people, call them names, act out in class, drive teachers insane but when he limped towards them, they all softened up because of feeling sorry for him.

Dad's who put their daughters in that position don't get to feel bad when we are pushed into a corner with nowhere to go. 

Go study. Go live your dream. They will be sad. But it is your life. If you don't do it now, your entire future will be a ""what if I had gone? What if I had studied more? What if I had found happiness?"""

That's just a little too in-my-space. But that's just my opinion.."

Nonsense."

Drawing, singing, ballet, salsa, hip hop, karate, everything. I admit that of late I have started to wish I had become really good at one thing. But I'm just more than average at most things. Not good enough to make a career out of it, but better than a lot of people at said thing."

Who does that??

That sounds so traumatising to me. I can't imagine how you would have felt.  That was a terrible gift and they should feel bad about it."
