And if they say he won there will be nothing we can do. So hopefully the GOP can’t steal enough elections to get the House back."

The $10,000 is like the MSRP that no one pays but it’s a place to start the negotiations."

There is also Jeff Skoll, the first employee of eBay.  He's a billionaire and super kind and generous and definitely not narcissistic.  

In fact, when I was with him once, someone asked, ""How has being a billionaire changed you"", and he said, ""well, I'm still ugly, but the girls like me now""."

Why does everyone keep reporting this.  It's not true.  It's true they didn't pay any tax on their profits, because they didn't have any.  It's called carry forward losses, and you can use the same rule on your own taxes.

They also paid quite a lot in other federal taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare for their employees, as well as other federal taxes."

ABoringDystopia,ff4agzt,t1_ff40hrx,1579559086.0,"While the front page is technically determined by an algorithm, it's not  [a secret how it works](https://medium.com/hacking-and-gonzo/how-reddit-ranking-algorithms-work-ef111e33d0d9) and is pretty straightforward.  

It's ranked by score with a logarithmic time decay function.  The time constant is (well was last time I saw the code nine years ago) 12 hours.

So in other words, you need to have ten times as many points as a story 12 hours younger to be tied with it."
