Syncope? Maybe. But there were tire marks that show she made a right turn (which is an idiotic thing cause you turn right and you head directly into oncoming traffic)

My CSI skills, based upon numerous hours of Netflix crime shows, leads me to believe she made a right turn and realized her mistake and panicked right into the tree."

insaneparents,fell9qi,t3_epjhbe,1579224876.0,"37 year old dad here.  And I did something like this before. 

And shamefully, one time my eldest really upset me. So I made him throw his favorite skylander in the trash (this was about 5 years ago)

I IMMEDIATELY recognized I was nothing more than a bully parent, so I took it out and cleaned it with a baby wipe (in front of him, so he could see he wasn’t wrong; I was)

Gave it back to him and apologized. After a couple hours of us playing, I then told him why I got mad (he was being a typical 7 year old kid who wouldn’t listen) , and why I was wrong (I was 32 years old and forgot kids don’t always listen)

He now listens to me because he knows I was able to admit I was wrong...which is probably the only smart thing I’ve ever done."

It’s hard for me to plan, because we are not sure what to expect

We do plan on staying in Shibuya; as a matter of fact I’m actively looking at accommodations there. 

Universal studios japan: that’s one thing we marked down, namely for the Mario World they’re opening there (my kids are huge Nintendo and Mario fans)

Olympics: we aren’t planning on going to events, but mainly to say we are in Japan while the games are happening. Maybe a trip to Olympic village?

Anime: my older two kids finished Attack On Titan, but I wouldn’t necessarily say they’re fans of it; I would like them to see it, if anything to gain an appreciation of the birthplace of anime. 

We like food, a lot! So I will add Roppongi to our itinerary. 

Again thank you!!"

modernwarfare,feegjv4,t1_febci4o,1579033307.0,"Maybe it’s cause I’m older (37), but I really do appreciate this game a lot. It reminds me of MW2. My oldest son and I play (we alternate matches and compete on who can get the most kills). It’s a way to shut off my mind for an hour or two and just mindlessly try to get a match win. 

Free maps are a huge plus. I actually enjoy how they rotate the game modes; keeps the playlist fresh IMO

And crossplay is awesome. I can play with my cousins who are on PS4"

Full time SWAT
teaches law enforcement (or something) at the local JC during spring and fall semesters
Got his MBA
Got his CACS
Oh, and he breeds dogs, has 2 kids and is married.

I’m not saying this is healthy, but when I worked nights in the ICU, I didn’t eat at night. Helped me to avoid weight gain. I took a cat nap during my lunch time instead.

Nurse,fd0vapz,t3_ejrz33,1578124240.0,"Sarcastic answer: hit the liquor store before Monday, so you can self medicate after

Real answer: EVERY. ONE. Working was new at one point. For each time you feel like an idiot, someone else also did. This isn’t to minimize any fear, concerns, anxieties or worries you have; it’s to normalize it, and make you remember you are not alone. 

Anyone who minimizes those feelings you have, quite frankly, is a jackass. 

Anyone who tells you they never made a mistake, is lying about all the mistakes they made before."

PR snatch 118 (previous 111)

No CnJ PR, although I can now consistently hit 90-95% beltless (128-131kg)

PR back squat @ 184kg
