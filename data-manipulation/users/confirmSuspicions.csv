For the people afking, maybe you're so insufferable to play with that they felt like THEY had lost 20 minutes of their life.  

When people want to vote no in a game you might win 10% of the time in another 20 minutes, just remember that most of the people that afk just hop on another account the moment they afk while you're still complaining.  Riot doesn't lock your client to a single account even if it's in a current game.  :)

So be mad at riot don't be mad at the people taking advantage of the poor systems riot has in place.  And if you're mad about some loser afking and staying in the game with you, maybe quit playing such a loser game in the first place.  What's the difference in being mad at someone for afking and being mad at someone for playing poorly?  It amounts to the same thing.  Would you prefer that they faked it?  Because that's where these threads always end up.

I would recommend watching some of the marathon runs from some smaller events like rpg limit break, ESA, etc.,  They sometimes have pauses where the runner asks for a donation, but they typically get less donations on average.

These folks represent the most dedicated Stadia users.

They write glowing threads about their first experiences with the service (""I am satisfied with my purchase...my experience has been excellent and I'm excited to see what the future has in store for Stadia.""), and about bizarre use cases that demonstrate the promise of game streaming services.

Some are even gaming PC owners who talk about about how surprised they are that streaming games look as good as games that run locally. ""I was actually shocked and was sure my games looked better on my PC,"" they said.

But these folks — who were not only willing to take a chance on a new game service from Google but who participate actively in that service's community — are also starting to get frustrated.

And there's one reason for that: A lack of updates.
Two months after launch, Stadia still has a small game library and is missing many key features.
Google Stadia
Google

There's no way to voice chat on Google Stadia — a stock-standard part of the PC, Xbox, and PlayStation online gaming ecosystems, and something that even Nintendo has started to come around to with its Switch console. 

""What's going on there?"" one Reddit user wrote in the Stadia subreddit. ""How can it be that there is still no chat in Stadia?"" Moreover, there's no word on when a voice chat function is coming.

Both Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3, which launched over 10 years ago, had voice chat functionality built in from the start. 

There is no operating system or dashboard on the service, and there's no way to use the Google Stadia controller wirelessly on a computer or with a smartphone — it has to be connected with a wire. If you have an iPhone, Stadia doesn't work there yet, and the same thing goes for most Android phones; the only smartphone supported are Google's Pixel line. Even if you pay for the Pro version of Stadia, which is supposed to stream games in the highest 4K resolution, games played through Chrome don't stream in 4K.

That's before we start talking about promised features of Stadia that differentiate it from the competition, much of which isn't implemented. 

Google said you could watch a YouTube video of a game and, simply by clicking a button in the video, jump right into that game on Stadia. That has yet to materialize, nor is it clear when that's coming.

Thus far, Stadia is digital storefront that sells you games. Many of the platform features that people expect with a game platform are still missing, with no official word on when they'll actually drop.
Since launching in November, Google has said and done very little to update the experience — and it's still missing major features that were announced in March 2019.
Google GDC 2019 keynote, Phil Harrison, Stadia
Among other features touted at Stadia's big reveal in March 2019 was ""cross-platform play"" — the ability for games on Stadia to be played with people using other platforms, like Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. Though there are several Stadia games with communities on other platforms, none of those games support cross-platform play from Stadia. Google/YouTube

""When Stadia launched in November, we delivered a great gaming experience for players, and we continue to work toward our long-term vision for the future of gaming,"" Google representative Patrick Seybold told Business Insider in a statement. ""Stadia is an evolving platform, and we've been busy in the two months since launch adding great content, features and ways to play.""

Specifically, Seybold identified six key ways that the service has improved since launch:

    More games were added to the library (which stands at 26 titles currently, one of which is exclusive to Stadia).
    Updated existing Chromecast Ultra devices so that they were able to run Stadia.
    Purchased a game studio.
    Added Google Assistant support and game Achievements.
    Added Stream Connect in ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint.""
    Added a second ""Buddy Pass"" for Stadia users.

He also highlighted four key updates coming to Stadia in the first quarter of this year, including additional Android phone support.

It remains unclear when Stadia will support Apple devices, or when voice chat is coming, or when the free ""base"" version of the service will launch.

Of note, Google published a large Stadia update to its community blog on Thursday morning, after Business Insider reached out for comment on this story. We had asked for any form of message from Google for the early adopters who picked up Stadia last November — folks who are increasingly asking when Google is going to say something on the Stadia subreddit.
In 2020, Google is promising ""more than 120 games"" — including more than 10 exclusive games in the first half of the year. But will early adopters stick with it?
Google Stadia GDC Keynote, Phil Harrison
Google/YouTube

Google is promising a much bigger 2020, with ""more than 120 games"" scheduled to launch this year — over 10 of which are said to be exclusive to Stadia and launching in the first half.

Whether that will be enough to keep early adopters interested, let alone attract new buyers, remains to be seen.

The sentiment from early adopters isn't looking great for Google. For people who bought the Stadia ""Founder's Edition"" in November, which came with three months of Stadia Pro, there's a question to answer in the near future: Will I keep Stadia Pro after the three months runs out, which costs $10/month?

A discussion of who is and who isn't keeping their Stadia Pro membership paints a grim picture: The majority have already decided to cancel their membership, or are considering cancelling it."

    In November 2019, Google finally launched a major gaming platform that was in development for years: Google Stadia.
    Rather than buying games on a disc, or downloading them from a digital store, Stadia streams games over the internet. The service launched with access limited to customers willing to pay $129 for the ""Founder's Edition.""
    The platform's launch was rocky at best, with features missing and a paltry game library. Reviewers told potential buyers to wait and see.
    Since launch, Google hasn't said much about Stadia — and early adopters are getting impatient with the lack of updates. 
    Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Two months ago, Google made its first-ever major push into the multi-billion dollar video game industry with Stadia — a Netflix-like game service that streams games to a variety of devices, no game console required.

Two months later, and Stadia's early adopters are starting to revolt. Look no further than the Stadia subreddit community on Reddit for ample evidence.

""I've lost a lot of the excitement I had for the service,"" said one user. ""I'm not really excited because there simply doesn't seem to be anything to be excited about anymore.""

""It feels like it's died already,"" another user wrote. ""For anyone that's been around for a new gaming console coming out, it's crazy for the first year of it coming out, huge lineup of games constantly being thrown out, this feature, that feature all being announced...so much fun! Here I am trying to enjoy and justify the $130 I spent on this and I just can't at this point. We got tricked into being beta testers and it pisses me off.""

Meanwhile, Google has gone largely radio-silent, with no word on when promised features or big-ticket exclusive releases will actually start coming to the nascent service.

So, what's going on? Why are Stadia's most diehard, early adopting fans already losing interest?
A different kind of console launch.
Google Stadia w/ Chromecast Ultra
Google's Chromecast Ultra streaming device, left, and the Stadia controller, right. Google

Google Stadia is not a game console, nor is it a game platform, really — it's a digital storefront run by Google where you can buy individual games.

Right now, in order to access said storefront, you have to pay $130 up front for the Stadia ""Premiere"" edition. That comes with a Stadia gamepad, a Chromecast Ultra streaming device, and three months of access to Stadia ""Pro"" — a monthly subscription service that provides free games each month, enables users to stream games at ultra-HD 4K resolution, and offers a few other bells and whistles.

In so many words: The only way to play Stadia games when it launched in November was to spend $130 upfront. That remains the case in mid-January, despite Google's promise that a free version of the service will launch this year.

With most game console launches, you need the game console to play the games. That's what you're buying.

With Stadia, you don't need a box, nor do you need a Chromecast Ultra or Stadia controller. You can play Stadia games on any laptop with the Chrome browser installed, and you can connect whatever gamepad you want. Heck, you could just play with keyboard and mouse if you prefer.

So what are you paying $130 for, other than a few devices you don't need? You're paying for access — access to the Stadia ecosystem, where you then buy each game individually.
Early adopters.

$130 for access to a game store — a game store largely filled with games that are already available on other platforms, sometimes for less money — is a hard sell.

It's an especially hard sell with the kind of folks who buy game consoles at launch: Gamers who own current game consoles; who own many of the games on the launch list; who are distrustful of new entrants into the video game industry.

But tens of thousands of folks jumped in regardless, and the most dedicated of those early adopters can be found on places like Reddit's Stadia subreddit and the official Stadia Discord channel."

You won't want to do old leftovers with a cancer patient.  Some freezing is fine, but you don't want to keep things as fresh as possible still so I would only freeze a day or two worth of food at a time.  

For yourself, you can portion foods out to help save money and for the patient, just eat whatever they will tolerate and try to see if you get lucky with a few easy-to-cook dishes.  You'll need the peace of mind having an ace up your sleeve of a dish they like.  I didn't quite have that luxury, but what can you do, a lot of times the cancer meds you get put on makes everything taste like metal.

speedrun,fesi5wl,t1_ferk4y5,1579365377.0,"> Archiving individual achievements by accomplished runners doesn't seem stupid either. Plus archiving glitches and their discoverycan maybe lead to other glitches/skips being found if a knowledgeable new person looks at them with fresh eyes.

Ok so what I'm trying to get you to see is that this is all cyclical.  So if we want this conversation to be productive, we should draw the line somewhere like I mentioned with just archiving every world record from now onward. Imo, once that basic backbone is setup, then the rest of the pieces fall into place.  

However, you still are left with a shitload of work.  Is speedrun.com good enough for the basic information?  They don't store the actual videos.  So it's possible that sr.com and another site working together could be enough.  What about megamanleaderboards?  Etc.,

Split.io, speedrun.com, youtube, twitch each might store separate information.  So if you wanted to have an archive of something from those 4 sites, you have to store more information than each of them do separately and it has to be in a format that is capable of being used in the future.  And then don't forget you need backups for all of that as well, so just simplify it to say you need every data point in triplicate at a bare minimum and also be able to document subjective information.  Or some glitches have multiple versions etc.,

Then you have to have a way to obsolete or deprecate old content that no longer makes sense.  At that point, this is getting expensive, it takes longer and requires more volunteers and this would be the point most people just say fuck it and quit.  Who decides what new games get added?

leagueoflegends,ferfw8j,t3_eq3zp6,1579353385.0,"I agree, they go ""oh this kit is still fine"" and then that gets shuffled to the back.

We don't need them on every champ I would much rather have all of the visuals for old champs be priority for a year and then they can go back to what they were doing before.  

I agree with you in that the rate at which the older champions are catching up in terms of visuals is not an acceptable rate.  They are justifying it by saying that completely redoing old champs that need kit overhauls saves them from redoing the art twice.  But why the hell would they need to do that?  How is that a justification?  They have an amazing art department so that excuse doesn't hold any water.  Maybe 5 years ago that argument makes sense, but I don't buy it now."

speedrun,ferdarj,t1_fepmcdv,1579352588.0,"Same thing with a runner named fniure (fnuire?) from majora's mask.  Ennopp was doing school a lot at the time I think, but nevertheless, the guy had some impressive world record times of 1:26:xx any% I believe.  Then one day he just disappeared from the internet completely, runs and all.

The realization that all of the strategies he was using at that time would eventually be obsolete must have dawned on him and I think the explanation was just ""life stuff"" or something like that.  And look at where the game is at now.  It had 3-5 major developments since then and the old any% route he used to run is just a fond memory."
speedrun,ferbh1i,t3_eq9442,1579352032.0,"The problem comes from the continuity.  Someone with full access to spreadsheets quits or has some life event where they are just gone from the scene.  Then who takes over from that person?  Do we just have a volunteer chain of 100 people that always works on backups?  Who decides what is worthy of saving?  

Every run that has achieved world record in every game ever?  We already know that isn't possible so let's try for something a little less crazy sounding.  Every run that achieved world record in the last year?  Now we're getting somewhere.  It doesn't have to have a perfect history as long as it has a perfect future.  There has to be a continuous chain of ownership and that is one of the hardest things to manage.  Even an archived site with multiple backups isn't going to stand the test of time.  What about their splits?  What about 8 hour speedruns that are now 3 hours?  It just never ends.  There's always some cutoff point.

As for glitches and bugs and stuff, man I understand that and it really is a thing.  You just have to think about how much time it takes for your average runner to make a good video though.  Even if most of them are capable of doing it, that's a lot of time they aren't spending on the game directly, things change quickly in speedruns which often invalidates months of work (for example who cares about an old setup for a trick that is obsolete?  Or all it takes is a much faster one to take its place?).

A lot of people would rather spend their time with their hobby actually doing runs than documenting for an uncertain future.  I got to a point where I wanted to document just way too much stuff.  There's not enough time to do all of it so then you kind of resign yourself to whatever explanation is good enough at the time.  For some of us, it's do you want to speedrun or do you want to document speedruns?  Time spent doing one takes away from the other directly for most of us."

Someone could easily be sitting on it, that's true, but how would they also expect the bounty?  I can see where you're coming from if you can start to expect bounties, but we're not at that point yet. Being the first person to demonstrate it would be worth more if they marketed themselves properly.  And we're making a fair bit of assumptions with this.  If the goal is to have a faster setup in less time, money accomplishes that.  What if someone capable of doing it just didn't do it because they had no incentive before?  Are we going to assume they were sitting on it and are now being disingenuous?
