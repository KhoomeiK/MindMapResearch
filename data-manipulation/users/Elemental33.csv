SandersForPresident,fffw9te,t1_ffezklm,1579893188.0,As an Iowan it looks ok. Seems like most people are Trump supporters tho. I don't see much support for Democrats where I am.
bjj,ffac43z,t3_erqyl4,1579732037.0,"You still want to do all the steps just faster. And how fast depends on your style and the exact positioning. For arm bars for an example I have more success when I take it really slow. Going from mount > high mount > Smount > Armbar slowly and with a lot of control can be very successful if you do it correctly. I have had higher belts do it to me and it feels like it is unstoppable.

But some motions have to be fast. You can't throw up a triangle slowly or go for a sweep really taking your time."

maybemaybemaybe,ff7cjgt,t1_ff6yjlf,1579646383.0,New words and slang evolves over time. It has always been that way. It will always be that way. New words get added to the dictionary every year.
instantkarma,ff75bek,t1_ff71d0j,1579641418.0,I've never been all the way out but come close and my body was all tingly and I was super light headed. You kinda just want to sit down.
instantkarma,ff756mi,t1_ff6ysln,1579641343.0,Which is almost the opposite way you finish a choke like that. Where you want to pull your arm back and push their head forward.
instantkarma,ff6wi8j,t1_ff69qec,1579636328.0,Wait a few seconds after you feel him pass out then let them go. If you are standing don't let them smash their head on something. And walk away. They will wake up in a bit.
instantkarma,ff6w8r2,t1_ff65yri,1579636173.0,If you get it as deep as this guy did that fast it's over. If you don't you are still behind them with good position.

starterpacks,ff4alce,t1_ff4a7wq,1579559162.0,And how does that effect the way she plays Rosanne on TV? I completely understand why she got kicked off the show and if I was in charge I would have done it too. But if she didn't say anything about it publicly nobody would have given a shit even if there were rumors. I'm sure some of the bands I like are complete nutjobs but I am still going to like their music. Maybe my favorite youtuber is a secret KKK but if he is an expert in the thing I like to watch as long as he doesn't bring it up I don't give a shit it's still god content. You bring it up and make it public and put it in peoples faces and bad things are going to happen to your career deservedly so.

starterpacks,ff42szu,t1_ff4283b,1579554306.0,"I guess I don't normally judge someones acting, art, or music based on their political views. She was a good actress I don't really care what her political views are."

Saying that it is all racism completely ignores what actually happened with the Russia hacks and leaks, DNC's shenanigans between HC and Bernie, HC herself being a terrible candidate that not only comes off as a liar and in-genuine, but has a whole graveyard in her closet. Many Many people hated HC and took a chance on Trump as a wild card.  Just turns out to be a bad wild card."

leagueoflegends,fejy1tp,t1_fejtbkc,1579188452.0,I main adc I'm not super good but gold last season and my stats look like a plat players but that is probably inaccurate.

But a lot of time they are standing way behind me doing nothing even as a leona making me get 20 cs behind because I am basically 1v2.
