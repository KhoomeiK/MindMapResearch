StrongCurves,ffjc06x,t3_etv3is,1579995115.0,Is this sub based on that book? I’m new to this.
philosophy,ffjac6k,t1_ffj7ups,1579994129.0,"For the first one, what’s your point? Yes obviously animals have experiences that does not involve suffering too. So what? And some species help other species. And? 

I’m saying that an animal’s suffering’s ethical relevance is not determined by its cause. Are you strawmanning me or? Because I’m clearly saying that *all* animal suffering is ethically relevant; that does not exclude suffering caused by humans, but saying that “natural” suffering is just as important. Besides that, no one is harmed by extinction as such a claim would otherwise have the premise that something that does not exist can experience suffering. But only something that *does* exist can suffer. Ofc the process of extinction can be full of suffering making it morally wrong in such a case. But even in that case it would have the positive effect of ending that new animals are going to exist and suffer. 

I’m also not understanding the next paragraph - you are talking like I think humans are “above” other animals which I don’t think, I think I have made it clear that I value the reduction of suffering for all sentient animals? It’s pretty non-discriminatory. 

For the last one I can’t anything but agree - ofc we depend on functioning eco systems. But the argument is to use and preserve animals solely for our own sake. That’s fine but we were talking about the animals and not out own needs."
philosophy,ffj5s21,t1_ffinygs,1579991108.0,"It’s not important what exactly is causing animals’ suffering because so many things are. What humans cause wild animals is a drop in the ocean. The amount of suffering that naturally exists in nature is astronomical and will always be if nature is left do what it naturally does. Whether humans or nature is the cause of suffering doesn’t matter to the animal so any suffering an animal experiences is ethically relevant regardless of what caused it, that includes “natural” suffering like a predator mauling its prey, diseases, starving, loss of loved ones etc. It would be illogical to take the man-made suffering more into account than any other part of animal suffering. 

A consequence of the man-made changes in the environment is that animals reproduce less, having the very good consequence that less sentient beings are forced into this meat grinder."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffike6e,t1_ffhxqw3,1579975971.0,"This is also something I’ve thought about. Women who want an abortion have it as early as possible when the fetus is not capable of being sentient - so no harm is done to the fetus/embryo. The late term abortions where the fetus does have a risk of being sentient (above 23th week where the cortex starts to develop and connect to deeper brain regions) are almost solely done because of fetal defects or for the woman’s health. These are for women who did want the child but either have to abort or choose to do it due to avoiding unnecessary suffering for themselves and a handicapped child. 

There are cases where women in anti-abortion states have been late term pregnant but the fetus has died and is for some reason not expelled from their body. In that case she’s still not allowed to get an abortion and has to carry her otherwise wanted dead baby around. What is that insanity"
philosophy,ffighd1,t1_ffidqa9,1579973301.0,People can focus on animal welfare and think that that’s more important than that human’s exist. It’s still nonsensical to me because why should some species be more worth living than others? It’s not even that animals would have better lives without humans because nature will be brutal and full of suffering regardless. Why should all species not just go extinct then? Sounds better than only wiping out humans.

antinatalism,ffal02a,t1_ffajk3x,1579738386.0,"To say that a person can benefit to come into existence is to say that there somehow has to be a pre-life that would be worse than life. If it’s assumed that there’s nothing before life then literal nothingness can never be gained by anything, neither to become a sentient person. And inanimate matter can’t benefit by becoming conscious. As this is true, a person can’t benefit from coming into existence. 

To say that a person can benefit by being created will always be a circular argument as any “good” thing about existence is solely a consequence of existing. For example, the claim that it’s good to create a person so that they can experience happiness is circular because the happiness is only good *when* a person exists and is otherwise not good/has no value. You see how it’s a circular argument?"

antinatalism,ffachll,t1_ff9t828,1579732295.0,"This is a flawed counter argument because it assumes that the asymmetry is about the amount of pleasure and suffering a person experiences, and their subjective evaluation of their life, but it isn’t. 

The asymmetry is about how something that does not exist can’t be deprived of anything so whatever good thing there could come has no value. It doesn’t matter how much a person enjoys their life, it could never be any worse for them to never have existed. But regardless of how much pleasure they experience the suffering they also experience is still bad and should be avoided. 

So in one case there’s nothing bad while in the other case suffering is inflicted. And in one case there’s still nothing bad but in the other there’s pleasure but the pleasure would have no value if the person had just not existed."

Denmark,ff5tvgw,t1_ff5gsow,1579610053.0,"Kropslig autonomi siger at en person ejer sin egen krop. Jeg kan ikke bruge dine organer hvis jeg får brug for dem uden din tilladelse. Jeg kan heller ikke bruge dine organer til at redde et andet menneske hvis jeg vil, uanset om det er en rigtig person eller en embryon. Det er udelukkende din egen beslutning hvad dine organer skal bruges til. Dette skal også gælde for kvinder - de skal ikke tvinges til at donere deres krop til et foster hverken for fosterets skyld eller for at tilfredsstille en mand. Kropslig autonomi skal gælde for dem i lige så høj grad som det gælder mænd og ikke-gravide kvinder, hvis ikke det gør det så har fostre og mænd særrettighed til at overrule en kvindes kropslige autonomi - noget som er helt specielt og som ikke gælder i andre tilfælde. 

En mands kropslige autonomi krænkes ikke i den situation at en kvinde bliver gravid eller aborterer. Havde vi kunstige livmødre ville dette være en mulighed for mænd hvis de gerne vil have et barn alene, men de kan ikke tvinge kvinder til at være deres inkubatorer og heller ikke tvinge dem til at abortere. 

Mænd straffes ikke for kvinders valg, men der er konsekvenser ved deres egne valg, samt der kan ske uheld, som jo er uheld for begge parter. At sige at en person “straffes” fordi en anden person udøver deres basiske rettigheder er misvisende. Men jeg er enig i at en person ikke nødvendigvis skal tvinges til at tage konsekvenserne af deres handlinger eller uheld hvis de ikke ønsker. Man ville godt kunne sige at folk selv kan vælge om de vil betale børnepenge, og det vil man jo nok mene hvis man hælder til den liberale side. Personligt synes jeg også at folk selv skal kunne bestemme over dem selv så meget som muligt, så fri abort hele graviditeten og mulighed juridisk abort for begge køn (der er ikke nogen grund til at det kun skulle gælde for mænd - juridisk abort er jo bare en slags bortadoption til den anden forælder og er ikke intrinsicly en kønspolitisk sag. Hvis den anden forælder heller ikke gider have barnet så bortadopteres det helt og det er jo allerede en mulighed idag). Men ingen af delene kommer desværre til at ske, folk er for konservative. 

Du siger at sexual coercion (har det en dansk term?) stadig er lovligt. Så går jeg ud fra at det er lovligt for begge køn og at en mand heller ikke ville straffes for at prikke hul på kondomet eller skifte p-piller ud med andre piller? Altså det burde helt sikkert være ulovligt uanset køn men hvis det nu er lovligt for begge så har det ikke noget med køn og ligestilling at gøre."

Mennesker ejer deres egen krop - de er ikke bare organer som andre kan bruge efter ønske. 

Når barnet er født har mænd og kvinder også lige rettigheder - begge skal betale børnepenge til barnet hvis den anden forældre har forældremyndigheden. Her kan man jo sige at det skal være forældrenes ret til ikke at betale til barnet frem for barnets ret til pengene. De fleste mennesker ville nok mene at barnet ikke skal straffes for forældrenes valg - omend det er en kvinde eller mand der har snydt sin partner til graviditet (desuden en alvorlig forbrydelse men, ligesom voldtægt og andre reproduktive krænkelser meget svær at bevise) eller at den ene forældre siger ja til barnet men så får kolde fødder senere og ikke vil have noget med det at gøre."

Even tho some animals can consent they still can’t give a very clear consent.

If animal consent should be a thing we should be 100 % sure that the animal is not forced to do sexual activities it doesn’t want and the only way to do that is to let the animal control the act and determine what position it wants while the human doesn’t determine anything. 

But we could also say that because animal consent is so unclear, having sex with them is statutory rape. I mean, teens and even children can give more clear consent than animals just due to being able to talk so if they can’t consent it makes sense that an animal can’t either.

antinatalism,fdz8kle,t1_fdz0w6n,1578787728.0,"> Like I said, not everyone hates to be alive.

There’s no reason to strawman. My arguments and antinatalism have nothing to do with hating being alive, it has nothing to do with emotions, and I don’t like generic strawmen. 

Fact is that a person will experience some degree of suffering when created and will die. I assume you don’t think inflicting suffering and death on another is ethical. So regardless of the pleasure they will also experience you have also subjected them to suffering, and a violation does not disappear just because good things also happen. 

Now, it’s likely that there was nothing before being born and in that case no one would miss out on anything and there could not be any good thing about procreation; potential happiness is not good as it has no value for non-existence, and you avoid causing suffering that would otherwise have been caused. In case there are souls who do miss out on life that’s potentially a harm to them, and so procreation could be a good act, but it could also be that you do them a favor by not forcing them here. What if the pre-life is just super awesome and the souls don’t want to come here to experience unnecessary suffering? It sounds ridiculous but it’s no different from proposing that souls may benefit from coming here. We can’t assume anything but the odds are against that procreation can be a positive act, due to it both being possible to be positive and negative if there is a pre-life, but only being possible to be negative if there’s no pre-life. 

Regardless, when we don’t know something we should rather not base our decisions on ignorance in a way that will primarily affect another person. 

Having kids so that they can experience good things goes against your own argument of not assuming things and it also ignores the suffering it will experience."

You want to choose one scenario that causes great non-consensual suffering on a person over a scenario that causes no suffering because the organism isn’t sentient. Do you see the problem with having a moral system that is indifferent to the suffering of people? Suffering is by definition the subjective experience of harm, and you need sentience to experience it, by definition. So you can’t harm something that is not sentient, by definition. You can’t harm a bacteria, you can’t harm a computer or a non-sentient fetus. Whether the object is made from biological material or not does not change anything - organic matter is not more special than inorganic matter, biological material does not contain some special life force. What we humans define as biological life is a purely man-made construct, it doesn’t exist by itself. Some biologists have made the definition and that’s it. There’s nothing special about “life”, neither a plant, a bacteria or a fetus. A non-sentient fetus is just an arrangement of atoms like any other inanimate object.

I’m not the one making the law and what I’m arguing is not my personal opinion but rather the logical conclusion from how the law is. People do have bodily autonomy and it’s their right to own their own body and be free from other people and organisms using it against their will. If another person or organism’s life is dependent on another’s body that’s just too bad, they can’t overrule another’s bodily autonomy. Neither can you or I or a fetus or anyone else. The leap in logic of using sex as a violation of a potential fetus does not work either, people are free to have sex and that’s not a violation of anyone, and having sex is not an argument for taking people’s basic rights away and giving a fetus rights above other people."
Cringetopia,fdti650,t1_fdth9b4,1578717102.0,Are you suggesting I should base my opinion on abortion on my meaningless sentamentalities rather than logic?
Cringetopia,fdtekqu,t1_fdt6g90,1578715637.0,"You can’t make your own rules of logic just because you happen to be emotional about the subject. 

You can’t make up consent where there wasn’t consent just because you don’t agree with what another person was doing. Every person has a right to have sex in whatever way they want as long as they don’t violate another’s consent. If a conception happens, that’s not a violation of anyone except the woman as she’s the only one who would need to agree to it for her rights to not be violated. The man cannot have his bodily autonomy violated by a pregnancy, and the zygote can’t be violated either as there was no person before the conception to be violated, and arguably there’s still no person in the moment if you don’t consider a dot of human stem cells a person. The woman did not consent to the pregnancy by having sex as you can’t just make that leap just becaus you want. Sex is no violation of a potentially future fetus. 

If a conception happen and the woman does not want it, she is in her right to terminate if she has equal rights to everyone else - the right to own her own body and not have other people or organisms use it against her will. She is in her right to be free from others causing her great suffering and physical and mental trauma, which the pregnancy and birth might have caused her. It’s not another organism’s right to harm her for its own survival. Most people already do what they can to prevent the unfortunate circumstance of having to terminate but there will always be some accidents happening and people should not have their basic rights taken from them in those cases. 

Why are you against abortion? If we take a fetus that for certain is not sentient, why do you think it’s morally wrong to kill it? Do you apply the same reason to all organisms on earth? Why would it be wrong to do something that literally causes no harm to the organism due to it not being sentient? 

As a thought experiement, if we could program computers to have a consciousness would you say that it’s morally wrong to destroy a computer that isn’t conscious but had the ability to gain consciousness in the future, like with a fetus?"
Cringetopia,fdt4fcp,t1_fdt35rt,1578711780.0,"It doesn’t matter how much you want to apply it to your stance, it’s not how it works. 

The fetus is violating the woman by parasiticly sustaining itself in her body against her will and causing her suffering. She has a right to be free from suffering and to not have another person or organism use her body against her will. If I need your body to survive I can’t just use it without your consent. No one can. The fetus is not above everyone else. It does not have a right to use another person.

Edit: abortion is always last resort. People don’t do it for fun. You shouldn’t purposely decrease empathy for other people to support your stance."
antinatalism,fdt3opy,t1_fdsx94a,1578711505.0,"So you are pro-choice from what I get then. By defintion, not by your own identification. 

About the rights, no one has a right to overrule another’s bodily autonomy as it is now so banning abortion would give the fetus more rights than anyone else has. Why would a non-sentient or barely sentient organism have rights *above* a very sentient one? I know you don’t agree with a ban tho."
Cringetopia,fdt17bq,t1_fdsthyw,1578710589.0,"To be against abortion is ironically to treat the fetus as *more* human than anyone else. No one has the right to overrule another person’s bodily autonomy. If a person needs another’s body to survive they can’t forcely use their body against the donor’s will. Banning abortion is to give fetusses special rights that no one else has, and ironically they will lose rights when they are born and become an actual person."

Or, well, expect religious pro-lifers I guess as they actively want people to breed even if they don’t want to. 

If we want what’s best for people having abortion as an option is certainly better than forcing women to have children they don’t want. I really don’t see how you can think being pro sterilisation makes being against abortion a natural derivative of that, nor how you can claim being pro people’s wellbeing if you think forcing them to go through the trauma of pregnancy and birth against their will would be the best for them compared to having a wanted abortion? To me it also sounds like you are pro-choice. What’s the definition of being pro-life to you?  

Unwanted pregnacies will always happen and it’s implicit to want to decrease them. It’s much more a pro-choice stance to want to actually decrease unwanted pregancies so idk why you say that pro-choicers should “admit” that abortion should be reduced when they are much more vocal about that than pro-lifers.

truechildfree,fdsidgf,t3_emubod,1578703319.0,"What stands out to me is that one want comes from a place of wanting pleasure and happiness while the alternative comes from a place of anxiety and doubt. When you think about not having children you see yourself as satisfied with your life (I pressume?) but anxiety makes you doubt it. Anxiety can be good as it makes you think deeper about the decision but it shouldn’t determine it. In the end, it’s the happiness-based and genuine desires that should determine the decision, while the anxiety fucks right off. If you don’t truly want children you won’t regret not having them. Do you have them without genuinely wanting them it may be a good or ok experience but you’ll most likely have been happier without and you could also end up regretful and unhappy (and if you are unhappy and regretful, your legacy couldn’t mean less compared to your lost happiness and freedom). 

If you did have a child, that child also never asked to be a gamble, but will fall victim to it to a high degree. Afterall, having a child is solely done to benefit oneself while the child is the primary victim if the parents’ happiness project doesn’t go as planned and they don’t deserve that. So for the child’s sake, only have them if you are 100 % sure it’s the right decision."

There are risks with all medical products and that includes vaccines. There will always be a small minority of people who can’t use a normally harmless product.

It’s not about equivalents of the disease but rather the seriousness of the pain. Do you think your doctor would tell you that your pain is just in your mind if you regularly experienced kidney stone-level pain in your testicles? 

What studies? The one I linked had objective measures such as mortality and readmission. The part about the doctor’s communication was likely based on subjective evaluations. 

What’s your source for women complaining more and what do you even mean with that? Do you mean that they go more often to the doctor? If so, women do experience more pain and physical discomfort than men so that’s likely why they go more to the doctor.

Regardless, there’s an extreme amount of anecdotal evidence that women are taken less serious by both male and female doctors. It’s common for the average woman to experience being dismissed while this is not the case for men. Men aren’t told that their pain is just in their head. In my country the average time it takes before women get a diagnosis of endometriosis is *9 years* where they regularly went to doctors and described extreme pain but were dismissed. There’s no male equivalent of how much women are dismissed. And I live in a Scandinavian country so we do generally have good healthcare.
