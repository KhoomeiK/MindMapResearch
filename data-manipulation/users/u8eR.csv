AskReddit,fh02m14,t1_fgyz00b,1581199877.0,"We've been in our current interglacial period for about 12,500 years. The one before this one lasted 15,000 years and the one before that lasted 12,000 years. The average of the last 5 is 33,000 years. Suggesting another 25,000 to 50,000 years doesn't seem likely."
AskReddit,fh02c3b,t1_fgy89pj,1581199807.0,"We're not sure yet. We don't know how strong the orbital changes that cause interglacials and glacials will be. We're in a unique situation, so no one really knows what will happen. What we do know is that continued greenhouse emissions within the current interglacial period will have disastrous consequences for human and animal life if left unchecked. And we don't know how long this interglacial period will last."
AskReddit,fh01ecu,t1_fgygc5o,1581199613.0,"Interglacials don't typically last 50,000 years. We've been in ours for about 12,500 years. The one before that lasted 15,000 years years and the one before that lasted 12,000 years."
AskReddit,fh000rt,t1_fgyjhee,1581199268.0,"Glacials and interglacials are determined by orbital cycles. We don't know if orbital cycles could offset the current greenhouse effect. If they can, we'd enter another glacial period. If not, the Quaternary glaciation, the ""ice age,"" would come to an end."
AskReddit,fgzyjit,t1_fgyfkgt,1581198907.0,"That's the problem with ""ice age."" It's not an actual geologic term. We're in an ""ice age"" in the sense that we still have permanent ice sheets at the poles. We're in what's called the Quaternary glaciation. Each glaciation or ""ice age"" has cooler and warmer periods, known as glacials and interglacials. We're currently in an interglacial.

The movie Ice Age didn't really help, because it really was set in a glacial period. But Glacial Period doesn't really sound Iike a cool kids movie."
AskReddit,fgzvhlj,t1_fgyksvu,1581198099.0,"Small correction: we're still in the ""Quaternary ice age"". Each ice age has cooler and warmer periods, known as glacials and interglacials. We're in an interglacial period right now, that started around 12,000 years ago. The Last Glacial Period started about 105,000 years before this and is when permanent ice sheets extended down through parts of current USA, Russia, and Europe. This ""Last Glacial Period"" is what you're actually referring to.

Yes, humans could survive, but life as we know it would disappear. We couldn't fit the current 8 billion (and growing) humans into the habitable zones. Major economic centers such as NYC and London would be covered under massive ice sheets. Global depression would wreak havoc on our ability to sustain enjoyable lives. Billions would likely die."
AskReddit,fgzto7x,t1_fgy0rj1,1581197559.0,"No one knows. Average interglacial periods in the current ice age have lasted 33,000 years. But the previous two only lasted 15,000 and 12,000 years. We've been in ours for about 12,500 years. So, maybe soon, maybe 10,000+ years."
AskReddit,fgzt6gs,t1_fgy41e3,1581197392.0,"Highly doubtful. The last five interglacial periods of the current glaciation lasted an average of 33,000 years. The last two lasted 15,000 and 12,000 years. Our current interglacial period has been going on for about 12,500 years. Suggesting another 20,000 to 50,000 years is unrealistic if history is any indication."
AskReddit,fgzs95m,t1_fgy1b9v,1581197138.0,"No one knows. It depends on orbital cycles that we can't yet predict. We can look at geologic history for examples though. We know that the last interglacial period before the current one lasted 15,000 years and the one before that lasted 12,000 years. We've been in our current interglacial period for about 12,500 years.

So maybe 50 years, or maybe 5,000 years longer."
AskReddit,fgzrto2,t1_fgycpsq,1581197020.0,"It could. It depends on orbital cycles that we can't predict. The current interglacial began about 11.5 kya. The last one lasted about 15,000 years and the one before that about 12,000 years. By anyone's guess, we could be on the precipice of the next glacial."
AskReddit,fgzqn84,t1_fgy7z3c,1581196641.0,"We've been in the current Holocene interglacial period for about 12,000 years. The last interglacial period before the current one lasted 15,000 years. The one before that lasted 12,000 years. (But, yes, there have been longer interglacials in the more distant past.) 

No one can predict when interglacial or glacial periods will begin or end because they're due in part to orbital changes, which can't be predicted. But if recent history is any indication, it won't be anywhere near 50,000 years until the next glacial period. That is, if we don't melt the remaining permanent ice sheets before then."

AskReddit,fgzkkkf,t1_fgxuxig,1581195052.0,"Well we know that we've gone into an interglacial period regardless if there's going to be a glacial period that follows.

We know this because we have permanent ice coverage, but to a lesser extent than during glacial periods. And global average temperatures are warmer than during glacial periods. So we're in an interglacial period. 

The real question is if there will be a glacial period that follows our current interglacial period. There is consideration of creating a new epoch to mark the current period of anthropogenic influence on the climate and earth systems, appropriately called the anthropocene. It very well may be that through human influence that we melt all remaining permanent ice sheets and glaciers, therefore artificially brining to end our current ice age.

This would bring us into a new greenhouse age (what we call it when it's not an ice age), which the Earth hasn't experienced in 2.5 million years."
