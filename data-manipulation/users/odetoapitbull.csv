unpopularopinion,ffehd1h,t3_et1i5i,1579848055.0,"Saying “sir” and “ma’am” is very common in the Southern states of the US. It may sound ridiculous in other regions, but in the South not saying sir and ma’am is the equivalent of responding to people with terms like, “yeah”, “huh?” and basically being disrespectful. It’s old school, but ingrained into your upbringing. It doesn’t have really anything to do with age, but everything to do with respect. ."
