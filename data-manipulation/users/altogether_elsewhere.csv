> In 2009, member stations derived 6% of their revenue from federal, state and local government funding, 10% of their revenue from CPB grants, and 14% of their revenue from universities.

This funding amounts to approximately 2% of NPR's overall revenues. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR#Funding))

However re-reading that excerpt, I do think I somewhat misstated it.  It would be more accurate to say that NPR's *member stations* receive approximately 16% of their funding from the CPB and various levels of government, whereas NPR *itself* gets around 1-2% of its operating budget from government sources.

They frequently carry out terrorist drone strikes and bombings of civilian targets such as hospitals, schools, and weddings.  They also are a major sponsor of terrorist proxy groups (for example the CIA spent $1B arming insurgents to destabilize Syria, leading to the civil war).  Finally, the US's conventional military activities and wars of aggression have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and created the unstable conditions that have allowed terrorism to proliferate.

Iran has also attempted to exert its influence in the region and has supported various militias and insurgent groups, some of which are considered terrorists.  But these same militias have also contributed positively in the fight against ISIS and the resistance to US–Saudi–Israeli aggression in the region.

That being said, regardless of how you regard the US or Iran's role in the Middle East, you can't just go around assassinating officials of rival countries.
