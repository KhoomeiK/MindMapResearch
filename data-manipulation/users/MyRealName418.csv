Above and beyond that is “pikuach nefesh”, which is the Jewish principle of life over law. Then there are also the scriptures that state that sacrifice is not wanted by God. When he starts in on you, you should be able to throw those things at him as well. He may then understand that you’ve done your research and have made up your mind."

exjw,ffbsc01,t3_esomy7,1579780882.0,"I am so sorry about the passing of your grandmother. Im sure it’s even harder as this happened when you were trying to figure out what you believe. Personally, I’m a believer in reincarnation. That brings me comfort. I was born and raised as a JW, but this is one of the very first doctrines that i questioned. I was only 10 or 11 years old. I was never exposed to any other teachings, yet I felt this very strongly. 
As for what to tell your sons, how about presenting multiple beliefs; some believe in heaven, some believe in reincarnation, some believe that when you die, that’s it. When asked which of these you believe, there is no shame in telling them that you aren’t really sure. In fact, it’s a good lesson in not having to have all of the answer. The truth is, no one truly knows for certain what happens when a person dies, so all of these beliefs have merit. 
I hope you find some comfort to help you through your grief."

exjw,fdm98vm,t3_em2ir4,1578542980.0,"First, I just want to say that there’s no need to apologize for any rant or being “a mess”, as you put it. You are with friends here, and we won’t judge you. You can express how you feel and get a listening ear, and maybe even some advice that works for you. 
I went to the meetings to make my mother happy. That was decades ago. There wasn’t the plethora of information out there that there is now, but I knew it was wrong. I didn’t dare upset my mother and tell her how I really felt. Oddly enough, looking back, I’m not sure that she would have forced me to continue going. I didn’t know that then, so I felt trapped. I tuned out for most of the meetings; just dissociated from my body and went somewhere else in my head. I have always tried to see the good in people and situations, so when I wasn’t tuned out, I tried to at least find something that wasn’t so bad, like seeing my friend, knowing that it was the shorter meeting of the week (this was back when we had the book study), or thinking that at least the song we were singing wasn’t one of the ones I hated. I know it sounds trivial, but it did actually help some. I tried focusing on good, rather than bad. It’s very hard to do at times, but can help. I also like the suggestion that was made to talk to a trusted non-JW adult about, like a guidance counselor or teacher. Best of luck to you, and remember that we are always here to lend an ear.
