news,ffi9mp7,t1_ffhli9j,1579968620.0,"Not sure what the return policies are at Nordstrom, but it’s easy for (underpaid) retail workers to make errors like this. I’m sure some cashiers simply don’t care and just want to get the transaction over with.  When I worked retail, my store had very strict return policies. I had to make sure the card in the customer’s hand matched the last 4-digits of the card found on the receipt, that the prices ringing up get adjusted for the prices on the register, and that the product was in a sellable condition. In doing all of this, it’d be very easy to overlook another form of payment used for the transaction, especially since the majority of customers only use one form of payment. I wonder if I had done the situation you described without realizing it."

AskReddit,ffhfgrn,t1_ffev3ve,1579933028.0,"I found [this chart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population) that shows the number of English speakers per country vs total population. There are some huge discrepancies, most notably India. (Remember that in the poorer countries, young people make up a larger percentage of the overall population compared to wealthier countries.)

Although it is based on old and subjective data, it shows that we can easily overestimate how many people in the world can speak English if we’re mostly only exposed to people who can speak it."

I feel bad for them, but I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t feel comfortable to be panhandled in city centers. I do feel a bit of guilt every time they approach me or I walk by them. If I had the money and time to spare, I’d buy them food.

askwomenadvice,feo09cp,t3_eq4dnx,1579293392.0,"I know this doesn’t apply to your specific situation, but whenever someone acts shocked that I’m older than they think I am and make it seem they gave me a huge compliment, I sometimes lightheartedly say something like “apparently I’m at that age where it’s a compliment to say I look younger than I am. What’s wrong with being 28?” It’s particularly annoying when it’s a guy who seems to think women have an expiration date in terms of how long they can be attractive.

I don’t think what I say is particularly tactful, but it depends what you want to get out of the interaction. If you like the person, you can smile and make a joke out of it. Ignoring it is fine, too."

I was not interested in the sex itself but I really enjoyed his company and the way he made me feel.

I can’t speak for anyone else, but I subscribed after I was recently picked up unexpectedly after a show, seduced, and was  trying to figure out how the guy managed to do it so smoothly. I was very on guard, but he still managed to make it work. I told myself I would never let that happen to me—very dangerous to go to a hotel with someone who just met, but my curiosity, desire, and vulnerability got the best of me. I was heartbroken when he became distant after he got what he wanted.  

I don’t think what he did was by design as he seemed naturally charming. He was also a tour manager in the music industry and travels and parties frequently. However, I am fascinated that much of the advice here mimics what he did.

I’m really here the lurk, but gave my input once for a ridiculous question on telling a woman he will drop her after a few months. That said, the sub is called r/seduction, not r/pickupartist. It can be interpreted differently to newcomers."

trashy,fe9fizy,t1_fe82i5z,1578937098.0,"Paris Hilton comes to mind as a celebrity who was mainly famous for her personality and wealth before social media. She did modeling, dabbled in acting and singing, had a fragrance line, but she was known for her elitist image. She was her own brand.

There are other models/singers/actors who aren’t really that talented, but they’re famous for their image/personality. Something about them makes people keep looking.

“Influencer” is a general term. They brand themselves as a model, a travel blogger, a comedian, a makeup artist, etc, and then use their popularity to get brands to sponsor them. But yea, people are interested in them specifically, not what they’re selling."

They (at least the most successful ones) tend to be good with photography, video editing, and constantly coming up with content to entertain their followers. They also are savvy with marketing (well, maybe not so much the one featured in the OP) and building a network. Even without their social media platform, they still have the skills and experience to work a more traditional job in marketing or communications.

Again, I’m only referring to the very successful ones."

>*There is a waiting list but in case some of the other families back out I will contact you.*

So there is a waiting list for a golden retriever pup because they are products of show dogs. It kinda makes me sad that people would rather go on a waiting list than look elsewhere because they want a dog of an elite caliber."
