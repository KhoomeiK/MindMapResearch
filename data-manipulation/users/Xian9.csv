todayilearned,ffyd0yo,t1_ffxv0uf,1580343506.0,"I just think it's relatable. People who are really into something for a decently long period of time end up collecting some neat rarities which are fun for them to remember, but not actually a big deal."
gaming,ffxrqqp,t1_ffxmokp,1580331124.0,The chance to completely avoid games where the multiplayer scene doesn't last (probably because they aren't that good) is an advantage to me.
GetMotivated,ffrxu37,t3_euns5n,1580168351.0,Most people quit when they are almost there. That's why everyone says that starting is the easiest part.

movies,ffmibjt,t1_ffmb8d0,1580055108.0,Nearly all the people commenting just fall for it. To me that's the most interesting part of this thread.
todayilearned,ffmfop7,t1_fflranf,1580054008.0,"In jobs which require thinking I've noticed that most people seem to do that at home (or when walking their dogs or something). While at work they do the easier implementation parts or just busy-work with emails and stuff. So if they get to a point where they are behind on sleep or stuck at work when something hard needs figuring out, nothing much gets done that day."
movies,ffm6whk,t1_fflunm8,1580049569.0,"The title just doesn't match the data inside (despite the ""yes, really""). I find the idea that if we can imagine something we can act like it's true to be a bit odd."
UpliftingNews,ffi22hx,t3_etqk44,1579962782.0,"This seems to count the average number of visits instead of the number of people? I don't want to waste too much time looking, but that's what I'm getting from the article and the Gallup page.  

Of the course people visit the library a lot more than the cinema. People go there to get books, to take them back, to go to reading groups etc. Some students will go there every day or to multiple libraries on their campus, sometimes they stay overnight. Compare that to the cinema which has a bigger money and time commitment, so people only go once every two months. I expect the cinema is popular with more people than the library though (the opposite of the title)."
oddlysatisfying,ffaabgr,t1_ff9jp5r,1579730975.0,It's also popular on camping sites where there's no shortage of lawn.
Futurology,ff4hv28,t1_ff30vx3,1579563987.0,You would have to break down the 91% on the same level as the 9% first.
gaming,ff1g8km,t1_ff0cge8,1579478738.0,"For some reason I looked into this, apparently the Task Scheduler is the direction to go."
space,fekthga,t1_fekqm1g,1579207266.0,"If you just search for the term before 2013 there's a lot, for example [this](https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/watchtheskies/13oct_lunareclipse.html) article from 2004."
GetMotivated,feha2hi,t1_fegz97m,1579112285.0,"They aren't entirely separate (and enable each other), the running theme is medic. I looked at the timeline and didn't notice any rushed degrees or anything"
Life,fegkvka,t3_ep0by9,1579095923.0,"People don't start off with a bunch of skills and a job, and if you wait they won't arrive by themselves. I guess you know that though. What helped me was realising that I didn't have to pick one single thing that I wanted to do. I could just pick something interesting enough that wasn't too impractical, that way the door is wide open for career changes in the future. After getting one skillset that enables you to earn (and travel), you might get more just for variety."
worldnews,feewr4a,t1_fedn1aa,1579042883.0,"People waste so much time stating what it is in their own country, just have a table: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country"
gaming,fe4769x,t3_enquw3,1578856424.0,Sometimes they are only left because they didn't join in when all the action was happening.
aww,fe3wfvv,t1_fe3lr39,1578853493.0,There's charcoaled animals on the floor everywhere you look. I think they have bigger issues than the chance of a vegetable landing in exactly the wrong spot.
news,fdlmmon,t1_fdl7qpx,1578527463.0,The thing I don't understand is that they had a popular brand and website before Facebook even existed. They hired a lot more employees but never really maintained it or kept it modern. Did they forget to hire a web guy after their founders moved on?
philosophy,fcvs6j9,t1_fcvq099,1578008897.0,"I actually think they go too far with that. For example only extrapolating from what can be observed right now, leading to estimates that jump up every time there's a new telescope. Or, being so reluctant to discuss things that we can't be easily researched right now  (experiments) that they make the stopgap theories sound final.  

I'm not saying that I know a better alternative though."
GetMotivated,fcutrsy,t1_fcubryc,1577988330.0,"There isn't a completely unsimplified way to answer the question (people write entire books on this and similar things like career). I don't think it's an answer intended for people who can't ""get it"" though."
GetMotivated,fcrwwse,t1_fcraokt,1577907740.0,"He's talking about life progress, since that's the context. In life we have a large amount of things compounding together."
todayilearned,fcnmbdh,t1_fclz1w6,1577814208.0,"If you go get adequate business knowledge than you'll find the ideas before you're finished. Just pick one of the many things that need doing and don't try to be ""random"". I think most experienced people will have seen how companies they work for enter into new markets."
