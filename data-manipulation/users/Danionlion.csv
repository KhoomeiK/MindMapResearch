Besides, if you look around YouTube long enough you can probably find a video with you having hair. I’ll have a look around to see if I can find one"
Undertale,ff4pd3t,t1_ff3vekc,1579569223.0,Hehe tiny papy
Charadefensesquad,ff4le4w,t3_ereccz,1579566432.0,"As some people say, great theory, but I’d like to add one point.

Yes, Chara DID kill sans, asgore and Flowey, but the key difference between these murders is that Chara actually hesitates when you have the option to kill flowey. They see there best friend in flowey and I guess it sorta brings back there memories of good times and fun. When you press Z to kill flowey, you basically nudge them over the edge to kill their best friend. 

Just wanted to add this, thought it may add a bit to the theory :)"

Undertale,fexa543,t1_fex9w5s,1579427543.0,But not 100% confirmed
Undertale,fex9qhj,t1_fex9kzr,1579427370.0,"But still, it’s never mentioned that they wanted to slaughter the entire village. They may have wanted to do that for the intimidation factor"
Undertale,fex8w3t,t1_fex885r,1579427005.0,"Why? I know what asriel says, he basically mentions that Chara wasn’t the greatest person, and that they hated humanity. I know that. But is it ever mentioned that they wanted to SLAUGHTER the entire village? No. Most people tend to perceive that Chara wanted to slaughter the village."
Undertale,fex656j,t1_fex5w6t,1579425132.0,"Which is why Chara killed themselves so asriel and them could cross the barrier and collect souls. They were willing to die for the sake of monster kind cause they loved there family, and wanted to free them.

Sure. It wasn’t the most perfect plan. But don’t think Chara wanted to commit mass genocide just because of one imperfect plan."
Undertale,fex5a0t,t1_fex54k6,1579424650.0,They can. It’s just hasn’t been done before. The plaques in waterfall even mention that humans are able to absorb boss monster souls. Who happens to be boss monsters? *asgore and toriel* who’s to say asriel wouldn’t be one too?
Undertale,fev9c2w,t1_fetzs36,1579394680.0,"Chara didn’t want to mass slaughter a village. In fact Chara would’ve only wanted to collect 6 souls, the necessary amount to break the barrier with there own soul. If they wanted to murder the village, wouldn’t they have just killed a dreemur, took their soul, and went on there mass genocide? But they didn’t. 

Argument. Debunked."
