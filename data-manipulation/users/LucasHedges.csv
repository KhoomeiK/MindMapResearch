I'm not claiming those guys were legally or morally correct and that is beside the point. I am saying that their situation is evidence of armed citizens making the US government back down and the only reason the US government backed down was because of their guns. You people are claiming that the US government wouldn't ever back down because of armed citizens, which isn't the case. The facts back up what I am saying and contradicts what you are saying."
technology,ffg8o0d,t1_fffq4pn,1579900844.0,I'm not making the argument that civilians need guns to shoot the military. I don't think a scenario would ever exist that puts the US military vs american citizens in america. The right to bear arms is to shoot the politicians if they try to get too crazy. Trump is close to the type of president/government that the founding fathers feared and the reason why they gave as much importance to the second amendment as the first.

That's my entire point. I'm not justifying their actions or if they were legal or illegal. I'm saying that the government literally backed down because they had guns, like you said.

Yes, guns made the government back down."

Yeah, in a 1 vs 1 no rules fight with the military wouldn't end well for the civilians but there is no way that scenario would ever happen. Most military soldiers wouldn't attack american civilians and they would even lose a lot of high ranking members of the military if they decided to attack american citizens on american soil. The military isn't taught to look at american citizens as the enemy. Cops are the only ones who are actually trained to think american citizens are enemies. A 1 vs 1 fight with cops vs armed citizens would end badly for the cops.

I have a brother who is a active green beret and I've discussed it with him if he would ever attack american citizens on american soil because he was command to. His answer was ""no and I would actively fight against the government if that ever happened and so would 99% of the people I work with"". So there would be a lot of legit soldiers who would automatically defect from the military and be with the citizens. 

If you think the us government could start indiscriminately killing tens of thousands to millions of america citizens then you are being disingenuous at best. America can't indiscriminately kill people in afghanistan and iraq and those people aren't even american citizens."
technology,ffflg28,t1_fffkdg8,1579886510.0,"> I personally dont think they backed down because they were armed. They backed out out of bad public perception, IMO.

They said they backed down because they didn't want another Ruby Ridge or Wacco texas incident happening. So in my mind that means the government didn't want to kill innocent america's again like they did in the past. I doubt the government would have backed down if the ranch guys didn't have guns because there would have been no bloodshed."

No, the banks were lending money to farmers and the farmers were defaulting on the agreement/contract. That isn't ""attempting to maximize their return now"", it was just ""doing business as stated in a contract"". If you sign a contract and then default on your end of the contract then that is your fault, not the bank's fault. It was a smart move for the banks not to lend money in areas where it is known that the farmers won't pay and their neighbors will scared off outside bidders with a noose. Bank can do make money in other places but a farmer can only make money on their land. It was pretty stupid, unethical, and illegal of the farmers to fuck over the banks when they failed to fulfill their end of the contract."
