If you want fighters that are hard to see and hard to hit, and are for shooting down fighters or missiles, then a tiny fighter with a 10cm railgun is great. With decent tech you can get these down to 250t or even less.

If you want to kill capital ships with beam fighters, 10cm anything isn't going to be great, so you probably want to max out your 500t mass budget, where \~50% of the mass is 3x-boosted engine and as much of the rest as you can manage is a gun.
