science,ffd9jst,t1_ffcxpfp,1579816091.0,"Which is so weird cause lots of countries have restrictions and not bans, it’s just that the general public don’t all have a gun on hand or in their home anyways. In Canada there is no ban there are only restrictions. You can’t carry firearms on you (to my knowledge) but anyone eligible is allowed to own one if they really wanted. I personally don’t know why there would be a need to own one other than hunting. If you need one for protection maybe you need to re-evaluate your countries safety and law enforcement but again I don’t live in the US and have not been in a situation where I thought, “I’m unsafe/feel unsafe I would be safer with a firearm.” It just sounds dystopian to me, idk."

worldnews,ffadd6h,t1_ff9l6jw,1579732895.0,"No they probably would force their daughters to marry, that man clearly doesn’t care about women enough for his own daughters to matter."
news,ffacqyu,t1_ffa9avl,1579732475.0,I dunno maybe just getting as much info as possible to make a decision? Instead of the good ol’ “okay that’s one side so that side is obviously the most correct side and nothing else matters!”
news,ffaclah,t1_ff9xxni,1579732366.0,"She doesn’t follow what the left tells her she should do, same with Bernie although ya has the “old man” factor. She doesn’t want to go to war either and the liberal party loves war.
Edit: changed democratic to liberal cause I’m not American and I have a hard time remembering which sides other names are which."

nottheonion,ffa12lp,t1_ff8v1v8,1579725745.0,Oh great I’m a hypochondriac :( who has regular migraines and sciatica.
videos,ff8z49u,t1_ff7owe9,1579700626.0,Maybe link articles documenting it instead. Any views she gets will still give her money
videos,ff8ykkg,t1_ff72nya,1579700182.0,No don’t apologize for calling her crazy. She is. Anyone telling you not to call her that are dumb.
TwoXChromosomes,ff8y4u8,t1_ff8um2q,1579699825.0,Not really cause I’m most first world countries you can’t get evicted from calling the police.
worldnews,ff8wpnu,t3_es5ol6,1579698586.0,I mean how would they package their 2 litres like for single use drinks I think they could’ve made annexation but I honestly don’t know how’d they sell their larger dozes besides just selling it in the cases but that’s more expensive to buy.
gaming,ff8wa73,t1_ff8ufhp,1579698200.0,"I agree. I personally don’t buy skins unless I can’t get it somehow within the game or if it come with the deluxe or platinum but I think that’s okay to get. But absolutely won’t get play to win games, ridiculous system."
movies,ff284mw,t1_ff20b54,1579496572.0,Well it apparently was supposed to be an anthology series so there was never gonna be a direct sequel they didn’t plane for one.
TwoXChromosomes,ff0trha,t1_fezw7hl,1579472216.0,"Like if they can rationalize it for themselves why can’t they empathize with others a realize maybe that those exact reasons are why they may be doing it? Sorry regardless of the example I still think people who think this way are shitty cause it’s only them that might get a pass while everyone else is doing it just cause they can. Like “oh I’m doing crack cause it makes me feel good even though I know it’s wrong and shouldn’t do it but other people who do crack are homeless junkies that will do any gross thing to get high.”  “Oh I take anti depressants cause I have depression even though I don’t want to support big pharma, but other people who do are lying and need to just get over it”"
TwoXChromosomes,ff0sda9,t3_eqv6uj,1579471833.0,It’s so frustrating to me that people get so bent out of shape about someone who won’t affect their life in any way including their decisions and then it becomes a non issue when it’s someone who does affect them. Like why do people purposely make their lives toxic for people that they literally don’t know and never will and probably will never come into any contact with.
gaming,ff0a22i,t1_fezx3kw,1579466790.0,Yea a lot of our pastors are young too. There are some older ones but we have a good amount of 20-30 year old pastors in Ontario.

tifu,fepl6pf,t1_fepkifw,1579323404.0,"“Sir did you look at this women while she was changing?” “Yes it’s my job to look at the security cameras.” “Well she said you made sexual remarks to her afterwards.” “I didn’t.” “Can you prove that?” “No.” “But you did see her naked and you were seen talking to her after?” “Yes.” “And no one but she can verify that you didn’t make harassing remarks towards at that time?”
Yea do I really need to continue? A sexual harassment suit is way worse to a company than a wrongful termination suit and if she did say he harassed her and he has no way to prove himself innocent they wouldn’t be terminating him wrongfully because he was sexually harassing his coworker for all they know. He said she said always goes to the person who has more to back up their claim and clearly if the only thing op has is to tell hr in case his coworker does do this then it’ll only make it worse for him to defend himself. the world isn’t black and white my dude. If a company wants you fired they’ll find a way."
tifu,feowni5,t1_feol3s9,1579307003.0,Hr protects the company not the employees. They’d rather fire a security guard then get slapped with a sexual harassment lawsuit/complaint.
AskReddit,feojqd3,t1_feog7aq,1579301082.0,Yea a lot of people don’t like Quebec. But Quebec doesn’t like anyone who’s not French.

funny,feo9app,t1_feo42ek,1579296821.0,I mean for the driving around part he could’ve called the businesses and asked if they have the part so they don’t have to drive there if it isn’t there. But I agree amazon is usually a much easier and better experience
television,feihgl8,t1_fehwuhd,1579138626.0,"Exactly, some people are arguing how it’s unethical but from what I’m reading I don’t agree with them, why should someone be taxed twice from two different countries when they earned it from only one? It just sounds more like they want to take as much money they can. I’m glad I live in a country where this isn’t a thing."
AskReddit,feif4hu,t3_ep7tm4,1579137062.0,"For me it’s forgiven by within temptation “watched the clouds drifting away, still the sun can’t warm my face” gets me every time , but you found me will 100% always make me cry on the spot. It reminds me of my life when I was in a really rough patch especially cause I actually was struggling with my faith at the time as well though that wasn’t why I was suffering."
