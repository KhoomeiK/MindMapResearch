But to say that men simply ""have an advantage"" is misleading. There are several aspects of life in which women have advantages over men, and those aren't even talked about the way women's issues are.

The truth is gender equality is a seriously complicated issue, and if we boil it down to one side having a general advantage over the other we will just further divide ourselves."

memes,fd9xv8b,t1_fd7odnj,1578239339.0,"Synthetic drugs are not deadly. There are countless synthetic drugs people take every day, like advil or zyrtec, that are completely harmless if used correctly. Synthetic drugs are also not always cheaper. Nicotine is rarely synthesized, just isolated from tobacco because it is cheaper than nicotine synthesis."

The deaths associated with Vitamin E just support the fact that cannabis should be legalized and regulated to avoid illegal operations adding risky things to harmless products."

There aren't nearly enough and every dog deserves a loving, comfortable place to live. I work a lot with a local shelter helping dogs find good homes with our clients and there are just so many sweet dogs that just want to be loved."

But when I found out that dominance doesn't exist in dogs I understood them much better and was able to do my job much more effectively. 

Dominance has been refuted by many dog behaviorists, and even was refuted by the man who did the initial study. It has caught so much traction despite this because it is an easy concept to understand. 

The point is, there is no hierarchy with dogs in a pack setting other than a mother/father vs their pups. This relationship is mimicked by dogs with their owners.

I encourage you to do more of your own research on dominance in dogs. The sooner we let go of this outdated understanding of dog behavior, the sooner we can provide the most comfortable and healthy lives for humanity's best companion.

Edit: I also appreciate you coming at this from a point of understanding and willingness to learn."

Dominance in dogs is a myth. This is an inappropriate greeting, but most likely caused by lack of socialization rather than any malicious intent. When dogs meet each other and have stiff body language, it means they are uncomfortable or unsure with the interaction. The display of confidence is used to warn other dogs to be respectful."
memes,famdz6w,t1_famaaen,1576201571.0,"This is only one side of the drug. Nicotine is an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), which means it inhibits the molecule responsible for eating up serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (others too probably, I can't remember). This causes more of those chemicals to float between your synapses for a longer period of time. The result is lessened anxiety, greater motivation, greater alertness, and a very mild euphoria especially when combined with drugs that interact with those neurochemicals. 

Nicotine dependency quickly becomes an issue because nicotine has a very short half life (around 1-2 hours) and tolerance tends to build up fast because of how often nicotine users tend to readminister."
