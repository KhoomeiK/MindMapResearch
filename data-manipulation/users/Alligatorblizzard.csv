LifeProTips,ffpcid7,t1_ffp4q3b,1580091622.0,">Turtles and other rodents that are domestic are often kept as pets

You're right about the turtles, and reptiles and amphibians in general -  the green anole is native to Florida and is common in the pet trade. And wild-caught anoles are part of the pet trade (which is not a bad thing for the brown anole, which is invasive in Florida, but the ethics of wild-caught green anoles as pets is more questionable). 

However, *rodents* aren't an example of the point you're trying to make. The most common pet mice and rats in the US are both domesticated species of European mice and rats (which definitely did come to the US with European settlers and while not native they're definitely everywhere in the US now). Rabbits, while not rodents, are also domesticated from European animals rather than the species that are native to the US."

The socialist and labor movements in the US in the late 1800s and early 1900s were a lot of the same people and highly connected to each other, and major unions of the time like the IWW being founded by socialists and other leftist anti-capitalist types. And they're the ones who got the 8 hour working day and 5 day work week that we think of as normal now, among other accomplishments. Of course, WWI made socialist stances completely impermissible and rather illegal - and iirc she escaped extensive jail time for her political opinions and protest actions due to similar reasoning that the newspapers used to 'forgive her'."

IAmA,feonyru,t1_fen8ycw,1579302767.0,"I'm from the Orlando area and moved to Minnesota a few years ago, and I've still got a bunch of family and friends in Florida - and I've managed to do round-trip from MSP-MCO for under $100 before, and it's usually under $150. So I was a bit surprised until I got to your caveats. I have flown Frontier in the past, and I completely agree with your opinion of them and I have some horror stories. I have thus far been happy with Spirit, but they do have one of the worst on-time percentages in the industry - I think they take special consideration of their direct flights between MSP and MCO though and earn their lousy reputation from their other routes.

Look into Southwest, their flight prices don't end up in aggregate searches but they're still reasonably cheap and they give two free checked bags - they're my favorite to fly with but they're usually a bit more expensive than Spirit. Also look at Allegiant, they tend to fly out of smaller airports and can have slightly strange schedules (some routes will only fly once or twice a week for example), but they're fairly cheap and those smaller airports are a lot nicer to deal with in general, and my dad swears that he gets more leg room on Allegiant flights."

MaliciousCompliance,fdibryt,t1_fdhvddz,1578439374.0,"Slight clarification - the ball used in fastpitch softball isn't exactly *soft*. There may be a tiny bit more give to it than a baseball due to the different construction, but it'll still give you bruises, concussions, and possibly broken bones just the same as a baseball would. Possibly worse because it weighs a bit more, the distances between players is shorter, and the game is played with metal bats so the force involved with a line drive can be worse. The game itself is played faster than baseball in most respects with generally less dominating pitchers - pitchers don't throw quite as fast so the game is slightly less dangerous for a batter but the infielders are way more likely to eat a line drive for a dozen different reasons."

asktransgender,fcgfb3q,t1_fcf0343,1577639342.0,"That's interesting that you can't Google most of the terms - usually Google's good about spitting out a book excerpt on a keyword. If you can't understand the preview that Google lets you see, presumably you'll have access to your University library, and you can just go check out that textbook (or another one that also mentions the topic - check the glossary in the back of a book for your keyword!). Also you need to be able to crawl before you can walk - if you consistently find yourself struggling with a certain subtopic you may want to page through an intro level textbook chapter on the subject. Something I like doing is writing down all the definitions I've looked up while reading, but often that's more helpful when I'm reading an advanced subject dedicated textbook. (Info: have you taken an observational astronomy class yet? From what I remember of mine, that covered a decent chunk of the somewhat more esoteric terms in astrophysics papers, to the point that a dedicated subject textbook was able to clarify most of the rest. I wish I had a textbook recommendation but the one my class used was not something I'd recommend for self study.)

TrollXChromosomes,fbuyq7p,t1_fbuixnt,1577122544.0,"I upvoted your longer rant, because I've made similar arguments about biological sex being a social construct in the past. And I think you're right that gender roles, and much of the social binary centered around biological sex are largely created by, useful to, and thus promoted by capitalists and historical systems which also exploited workers. But we see the subjugation of women throughout most recorded cultures historically (and I recognize and admit the biases with who was doing that recording). 

Some of the reason your top level post is getting heavily downvoted however may be because while not exactly *wrong*, it's not *helpful* for praxis. And it's a take that alienates and dismisses the lived experience of some marginalized groups. While your further statements imply a NERF rather than a TERF stance, certain criticisms of second wave feminism definitely apply to your rant. It neglects to acknowledge the lived experiences of trans people who have fundamentally body-based dysphoria, and the broad application of the ""coercively assigned [sex] at birth"" narrative has been criticised by the intersex community as dismissive of their unique trauma of being forcibly and surgically altered to appear within one of the binary constructed biological sexes. And that's not going into how medical research ignoring how women, or at least primarily estrogen-based bodies, generally respond differently in some cases (see heart attack symptoms, or how low dose aspirin's protective effects may be based on gender in the aggregate) and general lack of awareness of these differences has led to women dying needlessly.

You're throwing marginalized groups under the bus to make a point that doesn't help fix anything. Capitalism has made this mess significantly worse, but gender inequality won't go away by getting rid of capitalism - bigotry has gotten it's talons in too deep and we have to recognize and fight these issues within and through our construction of alternate power structures. The fall of capitalism alone won't make people stop being assholes to each other."
