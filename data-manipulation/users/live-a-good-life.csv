I am feeling stress lately because there are too many hates around. I just don't want to get involved with hate because it steals away my joy and I can't carry out my good intentions. So I soaked myself in the Word of God and I am calmed. I remember Love and it cheers me up and I can smile again. If today you are stress out by hate, don't go the hate-way. Come near to Love. Let Love shows you a better way."

I want to remind myself that God loves me very much and I am always loved by Him. I can forever hang on to His love and I can trust His love for me. It is because of God's love, I can love others. How about you? Whose love can you hang on to?
