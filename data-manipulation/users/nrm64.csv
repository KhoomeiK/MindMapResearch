funny,fdmvnux,t3_em7664,1578567959.0,"Considering an average foot length of 25.85 cm (0.84826 ft) per foot, the aforementioned 25,796,323,689,432 human feet (about 1,663 times the possible living number of feet on earth as of 9/1/2020), would turn out to be about  2.1882019x10¹³ imperial feet.

This distance is about 4,144,321,841.63 miles. This distance is impossible to achieve while both parties are still on earth so let's convert to aeronautical units (mean distance between the earth and the sun). 

This distance is roughly 44.581775 au. If we assume that at least one party would not wish to leave earth, but the request to be for restrained contact were to be upheld and the moving party needs some solid ground to live on, they're SoL if they wanted to stay in our solar system.

The dwarf planet Pluto is about 49.3 au away from the sun at its aphelion (maximum distance). However for most of Pluto's orbit it's actually closer, at an average of 39.5 au which would breach the terms of this hypothetical foot fetish fueled restraining order."
