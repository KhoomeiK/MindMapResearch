> From experience, someone can easily fuck off for a couple weeks by doing the minimum. Managment then has to spend a shit ton of time doing investigation, instead of helping those who are working hard.

Yes, probably shouldn't put it on him and I wouldn't do the same, but it's a little different than what most people are thinking when it says sewage. Though I'm not familiar with the kinds of chemicals that are used in textiles so I can't really say for sure how dangerous it is."

""repeatedly forcibly impregnate ~~female~~ cows""

Cows & heifers would become pregnant *regardless* so this really does not make sense as an argument against dairy farms. Just reminds me of people parroting things they hear to make them selves seem educated on the matter."
videos,ffndnz7,t1_ffn5nzg,1580064598.0,Lol. Have you ever been to a farm with cattle? Heifers & cows will get pregnant regardless as long as there is a bull.
todayilearned,ffnbsm1,t1_ffn3yow,1580064101.0,"There's no incentive or reason to do more than whats required. Why should someone put in more work than necessary when they aren't going to get any benefit from it? Lol. Only the company benefits from people doing more than what's required. Work to live, not live to work."
China_Flu,ffnbaf4,t1_ffmkxb8,1580063898.0,Right. But they can be prescribed as a prophylactic medication for possible secondary bacterial infections. Somewhat standard procedure since having an already weakened immune system practically invites bacteria.

Well pay them to do more? Not sure what you expect. Extra work for free? Probably exactly what you expect."

WHO was notified Dec. 31 of 27 cases of unknown pneumonia. The market suspected of being the source was closed the next day.

I mean, you can hate China for other reasons, like possible downplaying of the number of cases, but it didn't do as bad as SARS."

Upvotes and downvotes aren't really natural.

It takes a few upvotes on a post with misinformation to reach the top while a post with the correct information is downvoted to oblivion once it has been downvoted 4-5 times despite being correct."
