AskMenOver30,fepobst,t1_fenyqdi,1579325961.0,Yeah not as primary gig. Too much baggage and turmoil in academia these days it’s not worth it. But it’s a decent side job. Often it can come with use of school facilities so if you want to subsidize a hobby that is a bonus. Plus adjuncts have no responsibilities beyond the class so no bullshit required. I make an extra 17 k per year  5:45-8 pm tues/Thursday 15 week semesters plus a small summer semester. I like to weld to I also get to use the metal shop no charge. Maybe a hobby would be good for you too
AskMenOver30,fenxjvl,t3_epzw9e,1579292290.0,"Not sure what you do professionally but if you have a skill you can teach a night class. Local community colleges don’t require a masters degree. And if you do have one you can teach at state schools as adjunct.

My Garand has some noticeable wobble to it with its m5. While my Springfield wears a 1905 and it fits like a glove. It can fit the Garand, but also rattles. Different wars, different tactics. How many times in WWII was the order ""Fix Bayonets"" given vs WWI? Order of magnitude. Though the Soviet Mosin apparently was issued (and sighted in) with spike bayonet attached. Soviets imagined a great future for bayonets against MG42s...So the mosin bayonet fits like a glove - and a tight one at that. 

As aside note, its not unheard of for countries to issue ""ersatz"" bayonets. Many especially from the WWI era are known as ""ersatz"" bayonets - simplified and crude, they were all about cutting corners to expedite manufacture. I understand there are over 80 patterns of German ersatz bayonets from WWI alone. There is a whole collectors market in this I hear. Their fit is shit generally. 

But there are also interesting things for M1s read this:

Anyway, lots of answers to your question, but I think if you are talking about a Garand, a little wobble and rattle is normal."

gunsmithing,fcl011w,t3_ehqhp5,1577736860.0,"I have done this. The main process is: cold blue the scratch, fill the void, scrape the filler and buff/polish the repair to blend. 

I have tried most of the cold bluing products out there, and I find that Brownell's 44/40 is the best a ""blending"" a repair. The liquid, not the cream. Prep is key - clean the scratch with Naptha, then with Acetone before rubbing on the bluing. I would also heat the metal a bit (with a heat gun or even a hair dryer). 

Fill the void with medium or thick viscosity CA glue. Use no accelerants, and make sure it is NOT quick dry (those can turn white when dry). You want to bead it in with a pipette. After it dries, take a razor blade and tape the ends exposing only a small middle section of blade - perpendicular to the bead, you scrape the glue that is proud of the existing finish. 

It may be good to go right there, but if its still visible you can buff and blend with 1000 grit wet sand and buff with 12000 grit micromesh. Finally using a rubbing compound to make it shine."
