askgaybros,ffbfv93,t3_esmc6c,1579763466.0,"Yeah, I know this feeling. I have a very good male friend who knows I'm gay, we go to nightclubs together, it's pretty fun. Twice, at the end of the night, he was sitting behind me on Uber and started giving me a shoulder massage. I was _so_ confused, I didn't know what to do and I forced myself not to enjoy it. But it felt so fucking good. Is that something friends do?"
AskGayMen,felws68,t3_epnkt6,1579232894.0,"I just want to say that while I do enjoy being a bottom, I'm always worried about the health of my anus, my rectum, and my colon. I feel like people on the internet are overenthusiastic when it comes to anal sex, but the reality is often milder than most of the stories people tell here.

It's sex. It might hurt, it might be a tad uncomfortable, but it should never go over your limit. Know your limits. The scientific information about the length of the rectum is a nice way to probe your limits. Take care, stay safe."

gaybros,fdqikyc,t1_fdqg80l,1578667557.0,Genies are well-known tricksters. Their stories teach we should be careful what we wish for. I thought shedding light on the potential problems of the wording was relevant.
MensLib,fdqfvfd,t1_fdqcpbr,1578665625.0,"Thinking about it, it's an odd double standard. How are men supposed to lose their virginity if women are shamed into keeping theirs? I guess the old solution for this was marriage, but that isn't a goal anymore. Why does the double standard linger then?"
gaybros,fdqd9r2,t1_fdq807p,1578663593.0,"It's not irrelevant because that's the world we're living in, a world where some families can afford an implant and others can't. I guess you can always use abstraction to come up with a ""higher order right"", but the reality is that the family who can afford the implant may feel like the poor family who was aided has a _privilege_ — and this reasoning is based in some understanding of ""equality"".

On a more general level, people will always be different from one another and will always have different needs. Socialism is beautiful in which it states: ""from each according his ability, to each according his need"". But that's not exactly equal rights, in my opinion."
gaybros,fdphg8s,t1_fdp4gg6,1578628726.0,"Consider two babies who are born deaf. One is poor, the other is rich. Almost 90% of deaf children have parents who can hear properly. Both might have the right of getting a cochlear implant. But because the poor family can't afford it, it might need an additional right to apply for a grant or a subsidy.

People might argue this is unfair, but it's really in the best interest of the babies. It would be great if no one had to pay for an implant, but the reality is that funds are scarce. In this context, enforcing a right for free implants for everybody is impossible. And denying the poor family an opportunity to get it (because ""everyone should have the same rights"") could harm the child's development.

There are many cases like this in the world, usually a combination of individual needs and scarcity of resources."

bugs,fdp2xr4,t3_emdge3,1578618739.0,I'm using old reddit and it's still available. I believe the owner of a subreddit may apply styles to hide the option. So check if this is happening in all subs.
gaybros,fdp2kdq,t3_emgb29,1578618491.0,Different people have different needs. Absolutely equal rights would overlook some special needs. Just a thought.
getting_over_it,fdoxzqm,t3_emb7ud,1578615449.0,"They might be true, but you're probably more complex than a couple of bad traits. And there might be some traits you can change.

I think the Serenity Prayer sums this up pretty nicely:

>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

>Courage to change the things I can,

>And wisdom to know the difference.

Forget about waiting for God to grant you those things, it doesn't matter. The point is that you might have to accept some of your shortcomings, you might be able to change some — and it takes wisdom to decide what to accept and what to change.

Maybe you're focusing too much on your errors. Maybe you can't change everything you dislike about yourself, but you might be able to change part of it. Everyone has flaws, terrible flaws even — that's human, allow yourself to be human."

pokemon,fdnouwn,t1_fdnnzwr,1578590134.0,"Kinda. You could skip Bank if you had the correct chain of games and devices. It was messy, but it was possible.

pokemon,fdnnrpk,t1_fdnlr9e,1578589608.0,"They are selling the Dex back. If you don't buy the DLC, you have to trade — so a friend of yours must buy the DLC (gl with surprise trade). If you have the Pokemon on Bank or previous games, then you must pay for a Home subscription.

If no one buys the expansion and no one pays for Home, then no one gets the 200+ pokes in SwSh. So they are selling the Dex back."
pokemon,fdnktfe,t1_fdnfgwv,1578587892.0,"I understood the 200+ would show up on the DLC areas. If you don't buy the expansion, the only way to obtain them will be by trading."
pokemon,fdnkcsv,t1_fdnhu4x,1578587618.0,"You can obtain them via trade, you can't catch em in the wild (because their locations are in the DLC). In previous games, you had access to a larger roster of Pokemon using mechanics like the safari without paying for any patch.

Also, I don't get why they don't add the full Pokedex."

My life is going nowhere because I don't have any desires. I'm 33, but I've never had a steady job. I've been unemployed for 3 or 4 years. I don't know what I could work with, no one would hire me. I dropped out of college 4 times in the past 12 years, so I'm not qualified in any way. I have no goals, no aspirations. I don't live in the streets because my mother supports me financially. I'm a huge burden to her."

MensLib,fdl8a94,t3_elypiz,1578518736.0,"I guess that women, especially gay women, are much more knowledgeable about feminism, and thus are much more critical of marriage. Gay men tend to romanticize marriage — and also to benefit more from a patriarchal institution. I'm gay and I don't get why many of the gay men I know dream so much about marriage."

SubredditDrama,fd8z633,t1_fd61uo6,1578225709.0,"I've played TW3 and while it might seem against bigotry on the surface, it's actually about something else. Elves are some kind of master race whose numbers dwindled because lowly humans abused them. In my opinion, everything about elves echoes the Aryan narrative.

The prejudice against witchers is more interesting. But it's as much about racism as X-Men is (if every mutant was a white male). And then there's the prejudice against witches and mages, the most complex one. While the story makes a good point in depicting the way women get trapped in a men's world — and features strong, well-developed female characters —, it never hesitates to exploit their sexuality. Some of Geralt's sexual encounters are really gratuitous.

Edit: I mean, it seems to me the show producers introduced a diverse cast to deal with the most obvious controversies of The Witcher's universe. Had it stuck to the source, the Aryan narrative that inspires elven lore would be too obvious for Netflix. I see the show actively trying to distance itself from the most problematic aspects of the universe — that's for the best, I guess, but it does misrepresent the source."
