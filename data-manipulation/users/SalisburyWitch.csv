EntitledBitch,fe3j8qb,t3_enac1r,1578849703.0,"I live near a somewhat big air base on the East coast.  Many of our areas stores and restaurants offer discounts to military FAMILIES.  This means that if you have that ID card, you have the discount.  They don’t differentiate between active and retired, dependent or member.  I grew up an “AF brat”, and saw that different areas treat the military differently, but most offer their discounts to anyone with a military ID.

Most military dependent wives aren’t like this person - most of them when they are denied a discount just either decide to go elsewhere later, or suck it up and just remember the policy.  They don’t complain about it to corporate UNLESS they have been to that chain in other areas that DID give them a discount, or they looked at the corporate discount policy and saw that there was one.  In that area, where there are a lot of Navy personnel, there is a HUGE chance that the military member is going to be deployed.  This is important because chances are that member’s family will be using area facilities without the active member is very high.  That’s why most military discounts include dependents.

That being said, CiCis are mostly franchisees, so it’s up to the franchise owners to determine discounts.  I don’t see where anyone would deliberately make a rule that would work against their business.  Military spouses have a network that even extends outside of the area.  If they deem it worthy, they will tell other areas when a business is “hostile” to the military family."

You did what you thought you had to because your ex wouldn’t enforce the law.

When he asks what you’re doing in the basement with his grandson, loudly respond that it’s an inappropriate question.  Tell him if he keeps making remarks about the cat, touching you, and inappropriate questions that you’re going to bring a cat with you the next time and trigger his allergies for good.  Or just take up crochet, and find cat fur yarn.  I bet he could really use scarves and ear warmers."

college,fcnir2k,t3_ei1gja,1577812502.0,"As far as changing majors, just don’t do it too often as it will lengthen your time in college.  I started out as a home ec teaching major and switched to Bio because the Home Ec Department list accreditation.  After I went Bio, I decided to change to Bio Teaching, and later to Botany.  They phased out botany so I changed to bio teaching again.  This was all between 1974 and 1977.  Then I dropped out, got married, had a child, and got divorced.  I went back to school on a program that put me in a different school in 1980, so I majored in Computer Engineering Technology, and graduated in 1982.  Couldn’t find work in the field unless I moved to New Jersey or California, which I couldn’t do without support.  In 1992, I went back to my original college with the support of my second husband, and finished the Bio Teaching degree - by this time, I just wasn’t into biology that much anymore, and would have preferred either History teaching, or another field entirely, but I didn’t have the money for that.  Got the degree in 1995, and never once taught in that field.   By 2000, I was completely out of education, and working in technology.  Now I work in a University library.  If you math is good - 7 semesters by 1977, 7 semesters by 1995, a total of 14 semesters (not counting the 2 year degree), for a total of 7 years to get that degree.

With Bio and Chem, have you considered Forensic Biology?"

Not so innocent.  Theft is still theft.  Where I work, virtually any time a phone is unattended, it disappears, but for some reason, if it’s on a charger, it’s relatively safe (only 50% of the time it vanishes).  I’ve only seen one person get their phone back.
