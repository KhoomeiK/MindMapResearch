relationships,fdqmo56,t3_emp7md,1578670292.0,"I would suggest you break it off unless he shows he is serious about setting boundaries. 

I dated someone like this for 2 years.. his mom knew English, drove, did her stuff. However, as soon as he and I have plans, suddenly she was incapable of doing her things. I begged and pleaded but he wouldn't or couldn't. I broke it off when I got an amazing job opportunity and he was supposed to take me out to celebrate. Literally 30 min before we were about to leave, she calls and asks my ex to take her to the grocery store. to. the freaking. grocery store. And the idiot goes. She also took his paycheck so.

Anyway, don't waste your time."
