ProgrammerHumor,ffrm9f0,t1_ffr18tg,1580160962.0,Python is way slower than V8 JS.
ProgrammerHumor,ffrlzwd,t1_ffr3erh,1580160802.0,"`this` in JS is the receiver of the method call. That is, when `x.y()` is called, then inside `y`, `this` is `x`.

Confusion occurs because `this` is *not* preserved inside inner functions. So, if you have:

    const x = {
        y() {
            function z() {
                console.log(this);
            }
            z();
        }
    };
    x.y();

…then `undefined` will be logged, because the call to `z` has no receiver object (the function is called directly), even though it's surrounded by a call to `y` whose `this === x`.

Similarly, taking a reference to a method and calling the reference won't work:

    const x = {
        y() {
            console.log(this);
        }
    };
    const f = x.y;
    f();

This will also log `undefined`, because although `f === x.y`, you called it without its receiver object.

There are ways to solve these problems, but they are nonetheless strange gotchas of the language."

When people started wanting fancy stuff like that, the answer should have been, “Okay. Here's WebAssembly (with direct access to threads, DOM, OpenGL, etc) and some APIs for attaching custom rendering and layout routines to DOM elements. Knock yourselves out.” The answer should *not* have been to implement everything under the sun in the browser core, which, as Microsoft has demonstrated, is insane and unsustainable.

>There's just multiple dimensions of cost and risk to this thing and you  have the option of dodging all of them so what you would really need is a  compelling reason that making your own makes you more money and makes  your users happier.

If developing a browser is so difficult that this is even a relevant consideration for an organization as big and well-funded as Microsoft, then it's too damn bloated.

Here's WebAssembly (with direct access to threads, DOM, OpenGL, etc) and some APIs for attaching custom rendering and layout routines to DOM elements. Knock yourselves out.”

Instead, the browser makers had the agonizingly stupid idea of adding tons and tons of bells and whistles like `box-shadow`, Web Animations, CSS 3D transformations, and a [half-dozen new JavaScript language features every friggin' year](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md). Not only is this insane and unsustainable, it's wasting valuable time that could be going toward making WebAssembly fast enough and powerful enough to fully replace JavaScript.

Java and Flash ran on computers from 20 years ago with decent performance. Far from being bloated, they're lightning-fast compared to the abominations we call browsers today.

As for browsers getting better at they do, that's only if you think their rampant scope creep is a good thing. I don't. Browsers should be natively good at only two things: displaying hypertext documents, and being extensible. Everything else belongs in custom code, not the browser core.

Of course, that would result in slower page loads (because more custom code requires more time to download), but tough titties. Regular websites don't need all that fancy shit anyway, and nobody cares about full-blown apps taking an extra 2 seconds to load for the first time."
