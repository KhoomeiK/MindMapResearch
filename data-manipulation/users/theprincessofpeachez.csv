Then my second thought was, because God is good? I knew you would see through both of those but I believe in God and Jesus because it's what makes sense to me. I know in my heart that God is real and the stories about him are true.
Yes religion is a belief system the definition of the word is, 
the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.

You've said that you believe in the sciences? So do I, but the difference is that I believe that God created those scientific phenomenons and Catholics discovered it. In 1927 Belgian Jesuit (Catholic) Priest and Mathematician/astronomer/professor of physics was the first to identify that the recession of galaxies can be explained by an expanding universe theory or what would be later called the Big Bang Theory."
