And it really hit the spot for cold weather comfort food. Normally I'm all about the chilies in winter but this was fabulous to me and I just had to share it with someone"

I just made them today and I'm very pleased. Sure they're not the ultra-fudgy-ness I go for in a traditional box mix brownie but, frankly, they might be one of the best from scratch brownies I've made (from scratch brownies has been something of a difficult quest for me, for whatever reason).

(The best box mix, by the way, is the [Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge one.](https://www.amazon.com/Pillsbury-Brownie-18-4-Ounce-Pack/dp/B00KO8FOB8/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?keywords=pillsbury+brownie+mix&qid=1578624221&sprefix=pillsbury+bro&sr=8-4).)"

It sounds like you're looking for paleo bread recipes, so maybe that search term will help? I don't know that a bread maker would help for that kind of bread so you're likely better off with just your oven. I can't go searching through recipes right now but I'm intrigued by this and intend to do some research when I have a chance. I made an almond flour pie crust and it was delicious so, like I said, I'm intrigued."
