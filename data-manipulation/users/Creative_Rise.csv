10 year old me: definitely has nightmares"
AskAcademiaUK,ffg1rlm,t1_ffg1nao,1579896590.0,"Yeah but again, it's not that black and white. I think trying to quantify it is problematic and misleading."
AskAcademiaUK,ffg1jv9,t1_ffg1hr9,1579896454.0,"Haha, sounds perfect. Best of luck!"
AskAcademiaUK,ffg1369,t1_ffg0vfw,1579896168.0,"Also, I can't emphasis enough - practice practice practice! Out loud.Go through your presentations, out loud, multiple times. Practice responding to obvious questions. It really makes a world of difference."
AskAcademiaUK,ffg0x22,t3_etfl90,1579896065.0,"I mean, sometimes...sometimes not. It's a difficult rule to try and quantify like that."
AskAcademiaUK,fffz0n2,t3_eteehc,1579894897.0,"I posted this in response to a similar question not so long ago:

Prepare for two areas of questioning - about your proposal/research and about you as a candidate.

You will probably answer questions on why you chose that area of research, why it holds value, and the potential impact. Why you propose the methods you do (why not the alternatives?), your philosophical underpinnings and timeframes etc. Ethics will probably come up. You don't need to have tonnes of detail quite yet, but you need to maker sure the ideas are watertight.

Then about you - why you want to do a PhD, your comprehension of what it involves, your prior experience/background, anything additional you can bring to the department.

Just know your proposal inside out, be enthusiastic and informed. Good luck!"

highereducation,ffadf8e,t3_esh8fb,1579732936.0,"Yeah we are pretty open about it where I work. Usually it's encouraged (in a 'we want to help you develop wherever you choose that to be' kinda way), we even get time off for interviews in many cases."

running,ff78ht5,t1_ff71ba8,1579643204.0,"I spent years running on the treadmill. My reason was that I am clumsy and the outdoors presented inherent danger of obstacles and things to fall over/into/down.  

Boy was i wrong!  I now run outdoors and where I used to be miserable, watching the distance slowly creep up and making mental calculations of how much longer I needed to go and when I could finish, I now experience landscapes and sunrises, morning parks and the city at twilight.. it's an absolute joy and the time flies by!"

We've all known the feeling of missing a bus or train and having to sit around in the cold - it sucks. For some people there is no escape from that.
