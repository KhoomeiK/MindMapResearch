I projected my own fears on to you, for more context my aunt's chi was 17 years old deaf and blind and could barely walk, we loved that old boy so much but we thought he was hanging on until he felt she was gonna be alright. I'm not saying this will happen in your case, every situation is different. Enjoy your new puppy but don't neglect your senior one."
Chihuahua,ff933cz,t3_es8s65,1579703657.0,"Do you think your senior chihuahua will accept her? My aunt had a senior chi and when they got another dog, the senior chi health started to deteriorate fast and then he died, it's like he felt was his time to go because they had another dog to look up to them. That's why I won't get another dog till mine past away, he's 5 years old but I'm not willing to take that risk."

Chihuahua,ff9220v,t1_ff7xhd0,1579702910.0,"Maybe is the diet he's in, I fed mine with boiled chicken 3 times a day, he does not shed a lot if none and does not tremble, I don't know."

Chihuahua,ff7lc3l,t3_es26k0,1579652284.0,"Yeah, mine does it too, generally is when he wants something from me, food being the main reason, or when it's time to sleep and I'm past bedtime because he needs help to get up on the bed.
Edit: Try to find out what he wants and give it to him, the stare will stop at least for a moment."

It took me 6 years to get another dog and even to this day I miss her so much. In time you would be able to look at her pictures and smile how crazy cute she was."

Chihuahua,fenioos,t3_eq2hxy,1579285530.0,"First thing is discard any medical condition that maybe affecting him, your vet will give you some useful advice in regards his weight. 
My chihuahua also gain weight after neutering, I gave him extra food and treats out of guilt, we're still struggling to keep the diet prescribe by his vet for him to lose those extra pounds because I have little will power to resist his begging eyes. 
As for the walks I get lucky if he wants to go around half block when we get out of the house, chis can be very stubborn you pulling his leash to force him to walk only makes things worst, but we can get creative, them Chis always are down to play, because of his weight he gets tired very fast so we play inside the house at least twice a day to keep him active or when the weather is good I pick him up and walk a couple of blocks away then I put him on the floor and walk back to the house, because he doesn't like to wander outside getting back to our house is his motivation to walk. Also I have notice if the nails are too long my dog has hard time walking.
What I'm trying to say is have patience don't freak out just yet, wait for the vet to clear if he has or not a medical condition because if he has one and we force them things can get worst. Sometimes we want them to behave certain way, but one thing is what we want and the other is what we can do.
Just remember how much you love him, I have to tell that to myself in the long run his health is more important and worth the sacrifices, even if that means say no to that puppy eyes."
aww,femfdd0,t3_epu5in,1579252598.0,He's so handsome and lucky you love him enough to keep him in your family. Thank you for being such a good human being.

Chihuahua,felgx25,t1_felabhx,1579221901.0,"My little chi-boy hasn't had an allergic reaction to shots yet, good to know this vaccine can cause it to beware. I lost mi first chihuahua because of the vet inject her something to kill thicks and fleas (he didn't say what it was, i didnt know any better and I trusted him) 2 weeks later she died. There are medication that are ok for other dogs but for chihuahuas is deadly poison."

Chihuahua,fe457vi,t1_fe2l4pb,1578855908.0,"I meant in the sense that he doesn't do anything special beside being a chi, but you're right he is."
Chihuahua,fe2i561,t3_enn4sw,1578838578.0,"Me myself have a chi I love deeply, he may not be as life saver as yours, he just wants to eat and sleep but his solely existence makes me want to keep on living. I guess you called her Sunny because she brings such sunshine to your life. Hugs to you and your dogs."
aww,fdstm9i,t1_fdsnlmh,1578707780.0,"And you should go find a safe space where you don't feel the urge to have an opinion full of hatred and have a little kindness towards stray cats, kittens have more probabilities to get adopted, it takes a good strong and kind person to adopt a senior and above all stray cat, they all deserve love. And that's all, have a good happy life (you probably need it more). Bye"
