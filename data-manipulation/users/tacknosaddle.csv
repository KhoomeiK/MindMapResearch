This isn't entirely true.  I heard a retired Department of State official talking about ""back channel diplomacy"" which is, in fact, a fairly common technique when the circumstances warrant it.  So if you think of prominent international agreements like the Iran nuclear deal or the Good Friday accord in Northern Ireland, both of them started out with efforts including people who were not all government employees.

The fork in the road here is that while true that non-government personnel have been used in diplomatic efforts,  the examples I cite and others are done to advance policy goals of the nation.  In this case it was done to advance the political goals of candidate Trump.  That's what makes it not okay."

He inherited an economy that was doing well, adding about 200,000 jobs a month for years, and the best you can say with regard to most metrics is that he hasn't fucked them up too bad.

It wouldn't be hard to find people who now crow about the unemployment rate being so low who were saying that the unemployment numbers during the Obama administration were a lie because they didn't count all of ""The people who have given up looking for work.""
