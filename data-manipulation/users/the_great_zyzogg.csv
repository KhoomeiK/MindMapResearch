PoliticalHumor,fekssyb,t1_fekqco6,1579206863.0,"This is a high school. This is about the time kids are figuring out whether or not they're gay. So it's entirely possible that the parents (or even the teen) didn't know that she's gay. It seems unlikely that anyone was trying to ""force-a-gay"" into a christian school. We still don't even know that she is gay. She's simply being perceived as gay. And now she's suddenly kicked out of a school. 

Your ""don't force people to accept gays"" argument should sound familiar. That was the exact argument to not force private business to service non-whites. It ultimately removes freedom from the people that need it the most. This isn't an equality-of-outcome thing. This is an equality-of-opportunity thing. 

The ""variety of reasons"" she was expelled looks mostly like it was for her being gay. If it was for her cutting class or bringing an e-cig in, she would have been expelled then and there. But they instead do it once this picture pops up. Her ""looking gay"" being any part of the reason for expelling her isn't just click-bait. It highlights an unjust prejudice that is unfortunately still significantly alive in our society. But if your okay with that, or your just looking for whatever reason you can to dismiss the whole thing (as you have been desperately doing), then you are indeed a callous asshole. 

And I wasn't looking for a reason to be offended. I know full well pics of headlines won't tell the whole story. That's why I went into articles looking at the details behind it. I reserved judgement until I had more details. And the details make it pretty clear that the school is run by a bunch of power-drunk homophobes.

The two articles don't really contradict each other. But the nbc-news article mentions the teen being on probation for cutting class and having an e-cigarette. I'm kind of surprised that Fox didn't put that detail in, as it would seem to defend the school in their decision. That makes the nbcnews article seem a lot less biased, since they're including details in the story that may contradict narrative the headline creates  (Assuming the probation was justified. I don't know how much I trust this school since their statements on the matter have been very vague). But in short, there doesn't seem to be any reason to doubt the facts reported by the nbcnews article. 

&#x200B;

Regardless, reading both articles carefully, it really looks like the photo was a factor in her being expelled. Even if the kid really was a problematic kid, a photo like this shouldn't be a factor at all in a decision to expel someone one. And the school's code of conduct does say  ""students can be punished for “lifestyle violations” that happen off-campus."" There was also a mention that the student's percieved sexuality was ""making other students uncomfortable."" This really does smell like the school is trying hard to 'weed-out-the-gays', contradicting /u/Tjb35's statement that "" There is no school that's going to expel a kid for taking a picture with rainbows."" 

And the thing about T\_D is that users there seem to prefer a space curated such that only their narrative ever gets exposed. They're pretty infamous at banning any users that post something the mods don't like. This attitude toward anything challenging their view bleeds over to other subeditors as well, so when someone posts an article that does challenge their view, rather than discuss the details, they just call the whole thing 'biased' as a lazy way of getting out of defending their position. That's really frustrating to deal with. So if you prefer to not have to defend the details of your narrative, going back to T\_D is the preferred action."

My point is you can't guess what kind of injuries someone on a bike will incur when they collide.
