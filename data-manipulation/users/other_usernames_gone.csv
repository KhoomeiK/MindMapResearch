ProgrammerHumor,feyqrtn,t1_fextpp9,1579449361.0,"Basically it relies on the fact that factoring numbers is trial and error, like if I said I had multiplied two numbers together to make 299 you'd have try every number less than 299 and see if they're a factor.

I used 13 and 23 and because they're both prime numbers I know that no two integers(other than 1 and 299) multiply together to make 299 so you're unlikely to find it by guessing(also the maths for the encryption stops working).

In RSA that's actually used the numbers are humongous(4096 bits in this case so about 50 digits long, a number so big English doesn't have a word to describe it), so it would take longer than the lifetime of the universe to guess the right numbers.

Although 2048 bits is what's normally used, which is still an insanely big number(about 30 digits long) and would still take way too long to guess
