I got mass downvoted for calling out a sensationalist headline less than a day ago on r/videos. China is the new Iran, is the new Iraq, is the new Afghanistan, is the new Vietnam etc -- Yanks always need some country to bully."
television,fgtu4qo,t1_fgst6n8,1581109363.0,"Weird, because I haave read in lots of places that an ep of Anthony Bourdain: Part's Unknown that was filmed in Iran was taken down in the states.

Can't imagine Netflix would self-censor?"

northernireland,fgt5upd,t1_fgt4n2f,1581099679.0,"Wouldn't surprise me at all if dealers were using it. I lived down the Lough Road for a time so I'd be going past it pretty often (usually on ma way to get a wee chip from Paul O'Haras chippy, or a carryout in the Courthouse etc). 

More surprised they're not just selling outta there houses though lmao, I thought that selling shit on the corner was something outta TV/the movies. That wee park has always had an issue with chavvy behaviour."
northernireland,fgt5de8,t1_fgt3j4e,1581099393.0,"Thats a bit of an outlier tbh like. I've a mega Irish name and so do certain family members of mine with a business on Windsor Ave. I've only ever had sectarian incidents around the invisible line around two decades ago (similar story, they spotted my older brothers Armagh collar).

I wouldn't go about shouting it like and would prob avoid telling strangers my name anywhere about the town lol. Wouldn't wear sportswear about mixed and/or protestant areas either, even if Lennon is my cousin lol.

I've been battered more times in Kilwilkie than I ever have around those parts."
northernireland,fgt423o,t3_f0b5y2,1581098609.0,"I wouldn't say Lurgan Park is a sectarian hotspot now like. That article you posted is from 13 years ago. You're more likely to bump into a couple ridin' in the bushes than you are to get mugged by somebody on sectarian grounds. Especially up around the kids park bit which is pretty commonly packed with loads of kids and parents etc.

TBH I'd say you're more likely to be attacked or bothered by wee scangers in Shankill park. It's right off Willy Street so ye've got the blootered ones on the weekend and its a hotspot for wee teenage hardlads with somethin to prove.

I will agree though that its bollocks that they're doing away with it. Town has seen little play areas bleed away left right and centre over the years."

For any foreign folk who don't know Keith Chegwin, he was a very popular childrens television show host/panto actor/much more. Very family friendly figure. So his on-screen twist where he played a homophobic, racist hatemonger was pretty hilariously out of character."
