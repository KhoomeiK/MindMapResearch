KitchenConfidential,fe439e9,t3_eno1sk,1578855364.0,"I'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with what seems to be an incompetent chef.  A truly successful  chef is taught to always ask for help before they go down in flames. That's usually what separates a successful  chef from an egotistical moron who thinks they can do it all on their own.  A kitchen is very much a team who needs to be able to work together to stay afloat. 
Hopefully this chef learns from this mistake, or at least realizes that he's even made a mistake in the first place."

legaladvice,fdjrnjp,t3_elnv20,1578484945.0,"When I was in high school, my best friend's house got robbed.  1 thing the thieves stole was her Nintendo Wii console.  I had the idea to take the console number off of the box they still had and to go to the Gamestops in the area and check to see if they had any consoles that were recently sold to them with the matching console number.
The police took that info and were able to track the console down to a Gamestop location, and because you need a valid id to sell anything to them, they were able to successfully find 1 of the persons responsible for the robbery.  
Just an idea.  I feel that in this situation, using an ip address could allow them to track the location of the stolen property, and even if it wasn't used at the thief's house, it might lead them to more information."
legaladvice,fdjbxu5,t1_fdj82a8,1578464698.0,"Because using the mail for illicit substances is a federal crime, when the feds intercept a package, they will allow it to finish delivery, and then they will stake out the delivery location and arrest the person upon picking the package up.  If no one goes to receive the package, no arrests are made."
legaladvice,fdj46xo,t1_fdisos5,1578457984.0,"Just to ease your mind, in my years of manufacturing/distribution I used the USPS for 99% of it.  Unless someone is really stupid with packaging bomb ass weed without properly sealing it, or just doing way too much without being very careful, it's not likely you will be caught.  
Also, those of my friends who did get caught always got arrested upon going to pick up the package.  If you do not go to pick it up, you will be fine. It may have your name on it, but from a legal standpoint, that doesn't mean you have any involvement or knowledge of the contents."

I grew up being harassed about my weight by my mom and the other kids in school, so after getting clean from shooting heroin and meth almost 2 years ago, I've gained weight.  A healthy amount of weight, but I still struggle with it given my childhood.  
I'm terrified of seeing people from my past because of the ""you've gained weight!"" Comments.  Of course I fucking gained weight, the last time these people saw me I was living under a freeway overpass, strungout on drugs.  Even though I know I'm healthy now, I still hate looking in the mirror.  
This is the kinda shit that makes me feel like I'm right to feel like I'm disgusting because I've put on weight.  Fuck this shit."
