LivestreamFail,ffoipir,t1_ffnzd81,1580078043.0,"Last year my grandma had a bout of badness, in and out of the hospital. 

The final time, she was fine the Friday night. Saturday morning the doctors told my mom and her sister to gather the family. My mom called me at work to tell me to come say bye. 

I had to wait for someone to come relieve me, 20 minutes later I was around the corner from the hospital when my mom called to tell me she was gone. I showed up anyway and could barely look at her. I don't know who was in that bed, but it wasn't my grandma. I don't know if it's better or worse that I never saw her like that alive. From my mom, cousin, and aunts accounts, it was brutal. They watched her die and could see every second of it. 

I've now been diagnosed with cancer as well, and I'm pissed. A different and more manageable kind, I have very good odds of survival. I feel like the rage helps fuel me. No fucking way is it going to take me out, too."
Futurology,ffo5own,t1_ffmlk6f,1580074427.0,"Do you mean my arguments? Because the concerns I raised are legitimate.

I'm a power engineering student and sustainable energy is my jam. I hope to play a part in making solar and wind more realistic, but I'm also deeply aware that we need real solutions now. 

Basically, never stop trying to improve wind and solar, but don't hang your hats on them quite yet. Focus on alternatives that are useful *now*"

Futurology,ffmkxqe,t1_fflgmim,1580056066.0,"Also, they aren't ""hugely viable"". 

They're well on their way, and maybe in a few decades our technology can advance enough to make them truly viable. 

There are other, far more reliable and effective methods that are useful *right now*,  like nuclear and hydroelectric. Nuclear is just as green as wind and solar. 

And no one really seems to have solutions for when these millions of panels and hundreds of thousands of turbines reach the end of their lifespan. They aren't recyclable.

It's weird that you're doing the exact same thing you're complaining I did. 

Either way, I don't care anymore. Have a good one."

trashy,ffi80zb,t1_ffi1ecw,1579967488.0,">I HAVE, however, wondered what the presence of black people in the dogs life consists of. 

It kind of sounds like you're saying that everyone who doesn't have black friends is racist. Which kind of makes it seem like you're arguing for people to have a token black friend. 

Maybe that's just my interpretation, but I felt the need to point that out."
