I Hope you find the advice you are looking for! Also I hope you keep the momentum going to find a new path with higher pay margins. No better time than the present!"
DecidingToBeBetter,ff8lynw,t3_es9j2c,1579685056.0,"What’s your current job? Do you like it? I guarantee you aren’t going to jump from 30k to 100k just by taking personality tests (no offense but this seems like a form of procrastination to me). Do you have any career interests worth pursuing? Even if you don’t know what “sparks” you....by this point of your life and career you should have been exposed to many other people’s jobs and should know of a few you 100% WOULD NOT want and maybe a few that intrigued you. In the meantime I’d recommend driving for uber or something to make some extra cash. It’ll give you something to do and you can have free “therapy”/small talk time explaining to ppl how you’re trying to figure out what you want to do next :P also by hearing what other people do it may help spark interests. 

If you are people friendly and want to put yourself to the test, you should get a real estate license. Low barriers to entry (just some courses) and your earning potential is entirely in your hands."
mentalhealth,ff8lj3x,t1_ff8kv1p,1579684392.0,"I’m glad I helped you because it’s 3:00 am here I’m laying in bed wide awake! Look up [Wherever You Go, There You Are ](https://www.amazon.com/Wherever-You-There-Are-Mindfulness/dp/1401307787). This book changed my life a few years ago. I’ve been meaning to reread it. It can be pretty redundant at times but it’s a good one."
mentalhealth,ff8kgk8,t3_es963u,1579682769.0,"Sorry you are going through just a hard time and having to deal with the aftermath of trauma. At least you realize that there’s this brick wall (aka your past) that’s holding you back. You should look into practicing mindfulness. With this practice in mind, whenever you get angry/resentful/manic about your past or what bad hands you’ve been dealt you’d:

1-acknowledge these negative feelings and give yourself a break. It’s ok to feel hurt. 

2-realize and accept these feelings are all because of the past.

3-remind yourself you can’t change your past but you can control your present and your future. 

4- let the negative feelings go, force yourself to think of or do something positive. 

You’ve acknowledged and validated your feelings. You aren’t denying them. But also you cannot let them dictate your future. You are far to young to feel as you will be unhappy the rest of your days. If you tell yourself you will be unhappy, you in fact will be unhappy. This becomes a self fulfilling prophesy. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Your best days are ahead of you. Let your rough past be a part of you, but don’t let it define you."
Austin,felpcwf,t1_felp4ix,1579227677.0,Funny you mention that...there was a group of cops inspecting a gravel truck today. At least 5 cops. I thought it was a drug search or something. But the other cop cars had pulled normal cars over.
Austin,felozvf,t1_felkyxk,1579227430.0,There were over 15 cops. About 8 of them were waiting in line (literally like cabs I wish I got a pic but I was intimidated) to pull people over but even before that there were 4-5 cars and one large truck already pulled over. I’m not sure if it was speed trap or headlights but it was a trap for sure. One cop on a motorcycle literally nodded at me. My first guess was they were checking for expired registrations. It was nuts.
Austin,felorxq,t3_eprsze,1579227279.0,I drove by it this morning it was the most surreal thing ever. It was all for headlights? I’ve never seen so many cops intentionally waiting to pull people over.
notebooks,fefeyf2,t3_eou65z,1579054896.0,I’ve been buying these exact pencils since middle school. I’m set for the rest of my life with these (and the .5mm). But that’s ok because I love them.
SkincareFlatlays,feab3wt,t1_fe8fvr7,1578946502.0,I’m always curious about buffet too...
SkincareAddiction,fdqop5i,t1_fdpx8h1,1578671576.0,"Me too and you’ve inspired me to think about asking for help! I feel like my face is getting better and more under control but I’m considering adding a few products to my regimen (my AM/PM routine is exactly the same. I use two serums after I wash my face but currently no moisturizer or spf. I’m 28 and see some forehead wrinkles budding and would love anti aging/firming products so I can at least believe I’m slowing down the aging process) and would love to hear people’s experiences/pros and cons of the products I’m looking into. I just recently discovered these skincare subreddits and so I’ve been lurking and reading up a lot. Never even knew certain products/brands existed until I found this page. 

Also advice: don’t go impulsively blow a bunch of money at Walgreens or CVS on products you think you need (in your case, aveeno) without reading up or taking careful consideration. A lot of drug store brands seem reasonably priced but if you keep buying them and they don’t work, you’re fulfilling and instant gratification at the store but are kinda just throwing away money. There’s a ton of price comparable/competitive products online (like the links and brands I mentioned) whose products are more genuine and pure than what’s at the drugstore. Obviously there are exceptions to what I said and not all drug store products are bad! (I’m not an extremist) ...I just feel the pain of blindly spending $20-$40 here and there on beauty crap and then:
1. Being frustrated because these expenses add up.
2. Buying a product and only using it a few times because I didn’t think it through at the store. 
3. Being frustrated to actually take the time to wash your face each night and go through the “routine” but not see the payoff. 

But hey trial and error gets you one step closer!"
SkincareAddiction,fdpl9hs,t1_fdogvsa,1578631762.0,"I hate to be blunt but it seems and looks like the Aveeno products you are using aren’t ideal for your skin type. So you use a foaming cleanser twice a day and a scrub once a day? Sounds like too much soap and not enough moisture. I think you should only use an exfoliating scrub (any exfoliator really) 2-3 times a week. No expert but I’d maybe try swapping the aveeno I foaming cleanser with something with a little more kick (maybe just once a day). I haven’t tried this so I can’t vouch for it, but maybe something like [Effacler Medicated Acne Face Wash](https://www.laroche-posay.us/face-and-body-skin-care/face-products/face-wash/effaclar-medicated-acne-face-wash-883140040231.html?cgid=face-wash#start=7) could help. It’s only $14.99! I’ve been reading a lot about La Roche Posay and keep seeing it on reddit...I plan on trying at least one or two of their products soon. If you choose a stronger cleanser to help with acne, you do need to add some form of moisture Back. 

Since you have a combo face of redness/oil/dry patches you’d be the perfect person to hop onto [The Ordinary](https://theordinary.com/regimenguide?ccm=6afb414ca0a748bd85ed7ead6c4e6729f133993f2fd49d2697d9aa1f3700dc05f70102cb1d00da802a8fe86a4f7a904b2cc58b019d79610ab89b7e00b33f328bc753a4096d6833cfdfd104393f7b6d2eddd2037e9bdb9e50de85e0968cedf353b9032f5d98551a244c13b062afb779989098503aed650e607f7da3f05457e3ff65c7ad1ebf409d507a2dc4872ef356c8) bandwagon that’s been buzzing around these skincare pages. You can get different Serums to try for different areas. I use the Cold Pressed Borage Seed Oil for redness and I think it helps. Not gonna lie, The Ordinary brand is super intimidating. If these products intrigue you, here’s a helpful [intro guide ](https://www.deciemchatroom.com/how-to-layer-the-ordinary/) I found about the products. 

Last important advise: don’t buy six new products and suddenly add all of them into your routine. If you do that and your face ends up worse, you will have no idea which products caused issues and which didn’t. 

Last thing to note: you are beautiful already and you courageous for asking for help.  Skincare is intimidating and expensive. I hope I helped a little bit!"
Skincare_Addiction,fdpefi4,t1_fc7cko8,1578626517.0,How did you pick which La Roche products to get? I’m 28 too and recently got some serums I like from The Ordinary But am still looking for moisturizers.
SkincareFlatlays,fdpcdm4,t1_fdp6u9a,1578625091.0,One last thing because I’ve spent the last 20 or so minutes reading up on this stuff...[The Idiots Guide for layering the Ordinary ](https://www.deciemchatroom.com/how-to-layer-the-ordinary/)  adds some greater explanations to the steps and differences between product types. This post actually made more sense to me than the regimen guide. The Anhydrous/Suspension/Water bases etc. intimated me and this breaks it up. There’s also [a link in the blog where you can](https://deciem.com/contact?awc=6180_1578625026_38c1ddf51812a6063d53d97aafc4e2ec&utm_source=awin&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=2019-07-26-Best+Beauty+Ever&utm_term=na&utm_content=na-na-na) where you can submit an inquiry to the company asking if the products would work. Hope this helps...I’m definitely gonna read up on this tomorrow!
SkincareFlatlays,fdpa6e2,t1_fdp6u9a,1578623591.0,Wow their website doesn’t have any advice or suggestions for what they mean by “conflicting”. I feel like I’ve read other people’s regimens and there are some (maybe more aggressive?) products that they only use every few days or when they catch on to certain blemishes. My assumption with the “conflicts” would be don’t use the conflict products at the same time (like you also assumed). I feel like after 8-12 hours your body has already absorbed whatever was in conflicting product A and you’re in the clear to use product B. BUT I hated chemistry so I’m not the best source by any means. Just sharing my two cents
SkincareFlatlays,fdp6dr8,t1_fdp5iz0,1578621061.0,Not OP But I went to the website and read [The regimen guide ](https://theordinary.com/regimenguide) and what areas each product targets. Ended up getting just two to start: the cold-pressed borage seed oil (for redness) and the Marine Hyaluronics (for hydration). By getting these two I’ve been a lot more dedicated to my morning and nightly regimen and my skin feels fresher and I can see a difference. Been using the two products for a month now and am considering adding another one or two. I definitely knew I wouldn’t keep up with a ton of products going from my starting point (which was a minimal if any skin care routine). I too am interested how other people decided so I hope someone else replies!
Journaling,fdnwp16,t3_em1n7x,1578594378.0,I love this. I always saved music festival bands/tickets (most things) by years but this makes me regret it. Cool to see all them together. I also regret not keeping a consolidated log of all the bands and concerts I’ve seen.

I know some thirty year olds that are just as exclusive as they were when they were 14. Drives me crazy. They are no better than anyone else.

bujo,fdl3seb,t3_elucjb,1578516562.0,"WOW this was the inspiration I needed. I've decided to try bullet journaling this year and have been struggling to find an efficient setup that works for me. I enjoy keeping a gratitude journal and wanted to integrate it into my dailies. Most Dailies I've found are pre-set where the space is pre-measured. When I saw your setup it clicked how I can integrate weeklies and dailies without having to spend to much time rewriting tasks and appointments and whatnots. [Here's my sketch](https://imgur.com/gallery/L0mqprZ) I'm going to work on refining before I put pen to (beautifully coveted) journal. Seriously, thank you for sharing your setup.

bujo,fdj11qv,t1_fcz9u3x,1578455719.0,"It’s not a system like bujo... more of a self-help guide to train yourself how to add habits you’ve been wanting (aka better posture or getting up at a certain time) and how to get rid of bad habits that derail you (ex Netflix for hours at a time or eating too much junk food). Here’s a [really helpful summary guide](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/). 

Not sure it will immediately help you with your bujo/goals stuff but it’s pretty insightful and matter of fact about how we can simply change our mindset to become that prime/efficient/ideal person that we are all striving to be."
bujo,fdj09o9,t1_fdbxsch,1578455173.0,"I hope OP reads your comment. I haven’t read TBM either but I just googled it’s insight on goals and I don’t necessarily agree with it which is probably why it’s confusing OP.  [TBM suggests](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/goals-are-lighthouses) to set goals without expectations that way we don’t set ourselves up for failure. I see why Carroll suggests this, keeping the concept of fitness in mind is better than just giving up if you realize training for that marathon is easier said than done. Goals need to be achievable and measurable. Having boundaries and better posture sound like areas in life OP wants to work on (and maintain mindfulness of), but they aren’t necessarily measurable goals. OP should still write down why it’s important to him/her but it may not be a true goal. 

OP I suggest making a [resolutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/el8653/a_little_late_but_i_liked_how_my_2020_resolutions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) /mindfulness page in your journal where you write all 30 “goals” and a sentence or two why it’s important. From there, each month (or week), introduce a few at a time."

I’m wanting mine more for goal tracking and doing a daily gratitude journal so I’m going combine weekly’s and monthly’s somehow (I don’t need to write and rewrite my schedule three times). I also like the idea of keeping a list of books and movies I want to see/read. I think I’ll use/save some pages at the beginning for stuff like this and then have the monthly/daily pages after that. It’s cool you have a journal just for art and hobbies. That will definitely be a good reference and walk down memory lane in the future!"

Where do you put pages like this? Like in the beginning before or after the futures? and before the monthly/daily stuff? or do you space out pages and put them somewhere else?
personalfinance,fbp6cnj,t1_fblqlqf,1577017975.0,"Yep. Every raise you get will be a percentage of what you make. So even getting that starting salary up a few $K will save you a year or two.
