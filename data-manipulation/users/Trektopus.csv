AskReddit,fee8kaf,t3_eopchr,1579028617.0,Happened in my own house in my own bedroom by a roommate.  When I had realized it was missing he had already left for classes. I want sure if I had just lost it in my room ( which could have been cleaner) or if I had lost it at like a store to something. While searching my room I took everything out piece by piece. Every piece of clothes. Every piece of furniture. Everything! Then brought it all back in piece by piece and out it all away. My wallet was nowhere to be found. My roommate got home just before I left for work that day. I changed into my uniform and tossed it on my desk before leaving my room. Ran into him in the living room and mentioned I had lost my wallet but said I had canceled all my credit cards. ( I didn't carry cash so I wasn't really losing anything. I was just mad that I had no license or anything until I could replace it all. I left for work. When I came back later that night I walked into my room an was going to get ready for bed. I grabbed the shirt I had thrown on my desk to put it back on and low and behold there is my wallet on the desk under it. I never told my roommate that I had taken everything out of my room and out it all back. He had taken my wallet and after I told him I canceled my cards he realized he had no use for it and put it back under my shirt to make it seem like I had just not noticed it there. He stole a lot of stuff from me before that. After that day I put a lock on my door.
