There’s even a combat element which causes you to strategise until you have enough tech to automate nuclear bomb production and shoot them out of a rail barge from miles away. Only to send an automated train over their to send your robots to set up a mining outpost to secure that delicious black gold. Its then pumped into the train and sent back to be processed into petroleum, light or heavy oil which is then converted to sulphuric acid or plastics. The acid going to make batteries to make robots to expand.

Conformity is the phenomena where a person will copy the groups actions.

I.e: group A says they hate kittens, person A comes over and even though they dont feel the same, say they do too to fit in.

Conformity to be liked is called Normative Social Influence, which is shallow, where the group ideals do not follow you into private and you privately disagree.

Conformity for information, where you dont know something and assume the group are right simply because they know more than you, is called informational social influence. This is deeper, often leading to internalisation, where the person takes on the values in private, this is more permanent too.

All of these occur in a work environment.

A famous study by Asch et al studied this by asking a participant to complete a very simple task of saying which line (out of three different lengths) was the same as a specific line. Set out with one line set to the side and three others to the right, one the same.

The task was obvious and when completed by a control group, 99% got it right. The test group had 7 confederates (actors who pretend to be participants) seated with the participant who all agreed that the line was the wrong one. The participant, 75% of the time said the same, despite knowing it was wrong. 

Asch found conformity depends on three factors: Size of the group, unanimity and task difficulty. 

He found the number of people needed for conformity maxed out at 3, the effect of adding more was negligible.

He also discovered that the higher the people agreed, the higher conformity was. 

Finally, he observed that making the task harder increased conformity, likely due to informational social influence (difficulty + others disagreeing makes you doubt yourself)

Be aware of this in the work environment. Stick to your ideals even though it seems difficult. Thats just psychology working against you

TLDR: stick to your own opinions, your mind makes you susceptible to others."
