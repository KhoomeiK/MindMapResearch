unpopularopinion,ff77j12,t1_ff7732k,1579642658.0,"The law also currently states that corporations are people.
Where does someone go to protest that, exactly? 
What gets someone on the news, where you can discuss how insane that is? 

Or say you agree with that. Eventually you get a group of people. What would they do, in your eyes, that would be effective and spread their message? People ignore anything that isn't in front of their face."
unpopularopinion,ff771zl,t1_ff76ry3,1579642394.0,"See, this is my kind of comment. 
Good point."
unpopularopinion,ff76x60,t1_ff7598d,1579642318.0,"
In the case of standing in the road and endangering lives. Yes. 

However, civil disobedience is how changes have been made in history, by fighting back against regimes that aim to hold people down. 

There will be a tipping point if things don't change, whether it's inequality, climate change... I respect anyone willing to risk their lives and careers for a cause. I may not like their means. 

My point was protests are inconvenient, that's all I said. Saying to do it in an ""acceptable way"" generally means on the side, where I can ignore you, and those don't work."
unpopularopinion,ff75tq6,t1_ff75748,1579641707.0,"Granted.
Let's say you want to protest climate change. That's an act of unity because we are all affected. You get a big group of people. 
In your eyes would you prefer they block, say, a major polluter in the city? What would that group do, hand out pamphlets that would be thrown away? 
Btw I'm onboard wth you on blocking a highway. My only point was a lot of people miss that there is no way to protest that doesn't annoy someone."

unpopularopinion,ff74jen,t1_ff749cs,1579640976.0,I'm sure a lot of people felt inconvenienced by Martin Luther King. He applied for permits to march and got denied again and again. His form of protesting could have made you late for work.
