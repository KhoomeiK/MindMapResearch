If I just am doing a preemptive strike because I know it’s prone to mites, I spray every other day but only wipe down like once a week, and then when I’m pretty sure it doesn’t have any I just spray occasionally because you never know! I do this with my elephant ear and this green and yellow skinny croton thing I have. They both get mites from time to time."

I’m from Jasper County. The central part of Iowa can have more rolling hills, and where I am from the interstate gets bottled up by semis who go slowly up the hills. There are flat areas. Once I went to see a friend in Hubbard (Hardin County) and it was so flat I could see for like ten miles out.
