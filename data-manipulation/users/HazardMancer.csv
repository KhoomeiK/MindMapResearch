It doesn't matter what it can be done ""safely"" with it, you set rules to control its implementation, THEN apply the technology. As it stands unchecked power is and can be freely used and abused - and you'd be none the wiser.

And yeah of course people think this is naive, because you're thinking about what ""good"" it can do, instead of what evils have already been perpetrated with zero resources and methods you can use apart from an ever-more-impossible legislation that could control the monster. You keep listing off services that would've been invented anyway - and had been. There was already altavista, yahoo, etc. GPS and navigation didn't have to be fed directly to a company that will correlate all that information to find out who you know, what you talk about and your affiliations, likes and dislikes. You emanate pure consumerism precisely by focusing on human beings purely as consumers. How about youtubers? They've been getting shafted and have zero recourse. What about these companies paying next to nothing in taxes? Nobody can reign them in and they keep lobbying for a bigger share and buying everyone off. Streamers too.

The only absolute here is that you've already created a monster, and instead of campaigning to rein it in, you sing its praises while looking at everyone else like they're clutching their walkmans. Listen to the word of warning about letting an already-proven-to-be-dangerous precedent get even worse. It's not even that some companies with use data to control us, it's that already being done by private interests and secret agencies with secret laws and secret judges are already behind the scenes working towards their best interests.

""Dos terceras partes de la riqueza están en manos del 10% más rico del país y el 1% de los muy ricos acaparan más de un tercio.""

""La distribución es todavía más desigual en los activos financieros: el 80% es propiedad del 10% más rico""

""En los últimos once años, entre 2003 y 2014, la riqueza del país aumentó a una tasa promedio anual de 7,9%, en términos reales, por lo que México duplicó el monto de su riqueza entre 2004 y 2014. En cambio, el producto interno bruto tuvo un magro crecimiento de 2,6% promedio anual en el mismo período. Esta disparidad entre el ritmo de aumento del producto y el de la riqueza provoca una mayor desigualdad. Aquellos que disponen de activos financieros han visto incrementar su ingreso y patrimonio a un ritmo mayor que los trabajadores, cuyo ingreso y riqueza depende tan sólo de las percepciones producto de su empleo. En los últimos años la tasa media de rendimiento del capital ha sido del 15% promedio anual (con un rango que va de 12% al 22%), mientras que el salario mínimo ha tenido un aumento promedio anual del 4% y las remuneraciones medias por persona ocupada de 3,8% promedio anual. Pese al bajo crecimiento de la economía, que preocupa a la mayoría de los economistas del país, la riqueza ha aumentado, principalmente la financiera. ""

gadgets,febyzt7,t1_feajcoz,1578964483.0,"Your post is incredibly naive, if you don't think any and all information mined from an individual is exponentially amplified and applied to the whole of society then I've got a bridge to sell you.

""having a few around"", the fact that ""everyone is doing it"" doesn't mean it's a moot point, you're literally part of the driving force making a future capitalist hellhole a reality. You don't worry about it the same way you don't worry about global climate change: It hasn't affected you directly yet. And by the time you realize how it's already too late. Your ignorance is simply feeding the status quo into an irremovable and unchanging monolith.

Like /u/asianlilly58 pointed out: Most of us don't even know how our information is being used, how it's distributed and you don't stop to consider if you'd be okay with it. You're just riding high on ""benefits"". You think all this shit is free and a net gain for you, but these companies didn't become trillion-dollar enterprises because of good faith deals."

mexico,febxeb0,t1_febokzy,1578963860.0,"Seguro ese 5% de méxico realmente son los que añaden valor y todos los demás estamos aquí de ladrones impuntuales faltistas. Excepto los que se van a otro país, ahí si estamos ""mandando a los mejores""? El mexicano tiene fama de trabajador y honesto en otros países para que salgas con la mamada.

Será porque en otros lados recompensan de manera correcta? Que en México venimos arrastrando el explotar a los morenos? Que nuestros políticos nos venden como mano de obra en vez de invertir en educación (y abusar de la ignorancia para reelegirse)?

Independientemente todo esto para decir que veo más influencia y responsabilidad en un sistema económico que no responsabiliza socialmente al 5% que tiene el 90% del dinero, que la gente ignorante actuando ignorantemente, especialmente que quieres gente quen o falte, sea puntual y no robe cuando las empresas pagan una mierda.

Como va el dicho? Paga cacahuates y tendrás changos."

Remember the term globalization? Those protesters might have been on to something. It seems it only benefits corporations and fuels regimes willing to tlet their people be treated like shit for money. And consuners accepted it tacitly, but now we bitch about the consequences."
