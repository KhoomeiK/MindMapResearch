1. 10 hour unpaid day vs 8 hour paid shift

Jesus. If I were in your shoes the second I heard ""Op can just do it."" That's the part where I'd say ""No thank you."""
GirlGamers,fdv0543,t3_emlvzc,1578741548.0,"Biggest thing I've found is networking - join community discords and visit other streamers you like and chat a bit. However, don't be like those that thing ""I watch you stream, you should watch me."" People might like to talk to you but that doesn't always translate to them coming to watch your stream regularly.

Don't be discouraged if you aren't growing as fast as you want. It can take a long time to get consistent viewers - even if it's just 1. Streaming is a very saturated thing right now so it can be hard to grow. It is also okay if you find that streaming isn't for you too.

Don't call out lurkers. A lot of people enjoy watching streams without talking.

As another commenter wrote, research streaming tools so you have the knowledge to set things up yourself - there are a lot of guides out there you can follow. Watch your vods back to see any technical issues that you might need to fix and such - framerates, audio quality etc."
