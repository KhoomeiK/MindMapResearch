>	We were in the Grand Union, [a] supermarket, getting some food, over by Greenwich or Cambridge, one or the other, with old Dorothea Brownell, Morrigan's godmother - now this is education! A little kid was fussing at the checkout counter, stuck in one of those baskets - it's all the lights in those places, make kids crazy, we all know that, don't we? Well, and the kid was fussy, and the parents were ragging on the kid, and... I get them to laugh, and the parents laugh, and the checkout person laughs.

>	Morrigan starts punching me in the side, and said - yelling at me! - she said, ""Why can't you be normal?""

>	And old Miss Brownell rapped Morrigan on her shin - rudely - with her cane, and said: ""He is normal - what you meant to say is 'average.'"""

I get if you have it set to auto they'd stay on, but all cars I've seen with that feature still allow you to turn the lights off manually."

Seattle,ff7cled,t1_ff7c1gm,1579646420.0,"Right, I get that. I was just wondering what happens to everyone driving cars made prior to that when it wasn't required. I guess they are ""grandfathered"" in so to speak."

Seattle,ff74p63,t1_ff6pvxh,1579641069.0,I think for sure the first two are the main reasons. Plus if they made it â€œthe lawâ€ what are people with older cars built without DRL supposed to do?
Seattle,ff74kqa,t1_ff72lo3,1579640997.0,DRL is not the same thing as having your lights on. Doesnâ€™t light up your rear at all.
Seattle,ff74gr4,t1_ff6ksut,1579640934.0,"Itâ€™s a nice thought, but Iâ€™m skeptical it would be very effective. I think a lot of people think their lights are already on and wouldnâ€™t think to check. Look at the signs at the ferry terminal telling people to only use their parking lights and yet so many people have their full lights on instead."

Seattle,ff74585,t1_ff6uspo,1579640748.0,Iâ€™m confused by his comment ... are you driving around with non working headlights?
Seattle,ff742jt,t1_ff6iirf,1579640706.0,"I think some of them are BC newer cars with â€œalways litâ€ dashboards give drivers a false sense of security thinking their lights are on. Iâ€™ve also had it happen where I have lights set for auto and a valet switches them to off and I donâ€™t notice right away and just assume the lights will come on automatically. But also, I suspect a lot of people are just oblivious. I saw a guy in a rented Uhaul pickup truck last night driving in the pith black with no lights other than the daytime run lights in the front."
