If I’m playing, say Japanese DDs, do not shell, but just try to torp. If you are detected, then shell away, but if you are not, you will become everybody’s target really fast.

With German DDs, I might try more of a load up the AP, pull in, and try to focus on removing the DD threat. By the time the cruisers and battleships show up, torp away.

With either, use the mini map, rather than the aiming cone, to determine where to fire the torps. Make sure you are close enough that they can at least reach the other side of the cap area, because that’s where the enemy BBs are going to park (unless they are taking a grand tour.)

Regardless, do not start shelling (i.e. getting attention) unless you can do a decent amount of damage before everybody targets you. And when I say “shell”, I do not suggest picking someone that can outgun you.

Also, it is a good idea to have a general strategy for each map and starting point. (“Go in, turn left around the island... pre-aim all weapons at that spot where I’m often seeing the enemy appear.”)"
WoWsBlitz,ffdz7gl,t3_esyzxt,1579832601.0,"I liked it, especially playing the DD Lebrecht Maas. Decent torps and punchy AP to keep enemy DDs out of the cap. Of the seven games I played on the last day, I picked up 5 Big Calibers and 2 Krakens.

Also a very good way to knock out daily/weekly mission requirements, especially “get 2 xx in a single battle.”

Can’t wait for T10 to YOLO repeatedly in my Shimakaze because respawning is faster than reloading. (I think I am at least half serious.)"
