There is one type of tea in the world, and it's English breakfast. The rest is weird hipster juice for people who read the guardian and perform the undoubted unspeakable violations on almonds to make ""almond milk"" . Earl Grey is technically tea at a push. 

From the one true type of tea you have a few options: Yorkshire tea, and Yorkshire tea gold if you want to treat yourself.

If you're from anywhere but the North of England, then I'm afraid you're buggered as our water is the ONLY water that can make tea. I'm not sure if you're able to import it but anything is better than poisoning your teas with the liquid rot that comes out the taps in London.

Make sure you leave your tea to brew for minute or two, only then can you remove the teabag and add milk. Anyone who puts the milk in before this is a traitor to the crown and an insult to basic human decency.

unpopularopinion,ff8e6c2,t1_ff725ea,1579674711.0,"So a suit has a structure to give it it's shape, now the cheapest way of this is a fused suit, where a piece of fabric is glued to the shell of the suit and heat-treated to retain its shape. This is what most cheap suits are made of and why they have the reputation of being hot as the superglue acts as a very effective insulator. Wheras half canvased is where the top half around the shoulder is sewn, and normally made out of horsehair, and full canvased is the whole thing is sewn. Sewing it means it ventilates better, moulds to your body over time and it means the suit drapes, or falls better.

A summer suit is a bit more ambiguous, it's essentially a suit designed for summer. It's generally very lightly or unstructured, meaning no canvas, half or unlined, meaning there's no/little lining in the suit, only the shell, and it's made out of a summery material like cotton or linen"

From the outside you couldn't tell the difference between a cheap suit and a Saville row tailored one so long as you find one that fits, the difference is in comfort. So actually it would probably make it almost impossible to tell who's rich and who's poor. And again, for £250 you've bought a lifetime garment, if my dream came to fruition, you've payed £250 for a something that you can wear (allowing two days for the fabric to rest) pretty much every third day for the rest of your life.

But then factor in everything else, first of all you're paying for a jacket and trousers, over a t-shirt that'll cover barely a third of your body. And for the reasons I highlighted in my post, suits make you look great.

Plus with the t shirt you'd have to also buy jackets and trousers, you get 3 or 4 pairs of suit and you're golden, you might need an overcoat in the winter, but I'd say that if you worked it out, the suit would come out significantly cheaper"

Taking care of a suit is really not hard either, if anything it would be good to have people take more care not to spill things and have to hang it up every night - that little bit of detail tends to have knockon effects to the way ti approach life, same reason you should always make your bed in the morning"

There's a reason the lounge suit and it's accompaniments have been pretty much the longest lasting style of dress in history, and it's because it looks fantastic. The suit accentuates a man's chest and broadens his shoulders whilst slimming his waist, it is one of the most complimentary things a man can wear. The same goes for the shirt, there's a reason collared shirts have been around for centuries.

People look the same because they by and large have no style of their own, I would say that business wear is one of the best dress codes because there is a massive variety in Jacket styles, trouser styles as well as millions of various colours, patterns and materials. Mix it together with the various shoes, shirts, waistcoats, ties, cravats or bow ties and you have a medium where you can express yourself in infinite ways, but one that maintains a basic structure that means that those less creative can still just follow the basic rules and look great as well.

If you want to talk about slaves to the system, I would say that the hoards of people that walk around with corporate branding plastered all over their clothes are much more indicative of that"
