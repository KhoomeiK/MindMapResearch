AskReddit,fexaqn7,t3_eqouu3,1579427818.0,"The Kubi from my name came from a character from the mobile game called ""The Battle Cats"" which is Kubiluga. When I first started using reddit I created my username by adding ""Crazed"" at the beggining and ""Cat"" at the end as in the game, the Crazed Cats: Crazed Cat, Crazed  Tank, etc. are one of the few cats that felt pretty cool to me, becoming ""CrazedKubilugaCat"". After some time I decided to proogressively shorten my name as it was too long becoming from said username to ""CrazedKubiCat"" then ""C.Kubi"". Then a collaboration event happened between The Battle Cats to the game ""Crash Fever"", an RPG/Puzzle Gacha game . I took a look and played Ceash Fever and it got my full attention as it was fun, gimmicks, amazing soundtrack, and art designs were was what made me enjoyed it. I loved it so much that it made me leave the Battle Cats game just to have more time playing it, so I decided to change my name to ""CFKubi"" But in recent times the balance of the game has been destroyed, almost every new unit released becoming obsolete or powercreeped in like 2 months. But now ive found my next adventure on the game ""Sdorica"", planning to change my name to ""SDKubi"" because its probably gonna be the game that ill be stuck enjoying for another few years.

tl;dr
CrazedKubilugaCat -> CrazedKubiCat -> C.Kubi -> CFKubi -> SDKubi(?)"
