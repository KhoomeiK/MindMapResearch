SiberianCats,ffac0ua,t3_esgesw,1579731978.0,"Definitely get a couple of scratchers! Try sisal and cardboard, many cats develop a preference so you can figure out which is best for them. Also suggest different types of toys so kitten can have different kinds of enrichment play.

If you can, get kitty on a schedule. Wake up, play, get breakfast, human parnts go to work. Humam parents get home, play until tired, get fed, bed time. Cats can be more active at night or early morning but you can get them used to/working around your schedule. Just takes time.

I personally just got pet insurance last year and I am REALLY glad I did. My cat has allergies and some special needs so there were many tests and check ups that I wish I had the insurance for. Even if your cat is perfectly healthy, it's nice to have the insurance just in case. 

As an example a friend of mine had the pet insurance and then her dog got cancer. All the treatments were covered and they were able to give her dog a fighting chance."

The younger one will be our ring bearer. We had to explain what that was to her, but she was very excited! She ran around the house yelling ""I get to the BUTTERBEAN!"" (She misheard ""ringbearer"")"

JUSTNOMIL,fek05md,t3_epk5oo,1579189769.0,"If you are uncomfortable you have every right to say, ""Mom when you touch my beard it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Do not touch my beard anymore."" If she gets mad, just firmly tell her, ""You cannot put your hands on anyone without their consent. Just because you are my mother doesn't give you special permission.""

If she won't drop it, you need to leave. Take your child and wife and tell her ""If you cannot respect my boundaries/me, then I cannot be around you."" Give her a time out.

Her manipulation concerning holding your child is a giant red flag to me. Stay strong and stay consistent! If you don't she will continue to push and may disregard important choices you make concerning your child as they get older.

If this seems difficult to do, just remember, you're a dad now. You have to model good and healthy behavior for your child. If your child was being touched in a way that made them uncomfortable, would you want them to stay quiet to ""keep the peace""? I imagine not. So if you have trouble doing it for you or even your wife, do it for your child. Model and practice good boundary setting.

Good luck."

AmItheAsshole,fds4z2z,t1_fds2qnq,1578694469.0,"I'm just going off of what OP said which was the paternity test was the first thing he asked about/said.

Totally agree that fathers should be able to ask for paternity tests. But if it was as OP claims (I get OP is likely a biased narrator) then the first thing he asked about was the paternity test. And also if they were friends for 2 years then dated and he knew he was her 3rd bf and the first person she was sexually active with, asking the way he (supposedly) did sounds bad."
AmItheAsshole,fdrzpxn,t1_fdrxgk2,1578692169.0,"Respectfully disagree. If first response had been, ""are you sure?/are you okay?/can you take another test with me there?"" Or something like that I'd say that OP was wrong. 

BF could have asked for paternity test after discussion with OP. He wouldn't have even had to ask if he had talked to her in detail because she'd have said ""I am getting an abortion."" Then no kid, no need to know paternity.

To immediately jump to her cheating with their background as friends etc sucks. And if we are thinking of insecurities/triggers etc. What about OP who clearly has had a mother who slut shames them and a culture that frowns on women having sex?"
AmItheAsshole,fdryqrq,t1_fdruvnk,1578691769.0,"Listen I'm not against people getting or asking for paternity tests. 

But considering he knew her background: he is third bf only, she took a long time to build trust to have sex, and he was her friend before hand and his first response was ""Can't me mine, I want a paternity test."" That's fucked. Shows he didn't really trust her at all."
AmItheAsshole,fdrrhr8,t1_fdrq2ap,1578688630.0,"You initially said they don't break.  They do break and they do fail was my point.  

According to studies condoms are closer to 85% effective because of error, misuse, or failure/breaking.  Some people don't have access to education on the matter of how to use them.  Point is, accusing OP of cheating because supposedly she shouldn't be able to get pregnant due to them using BC was pretty douchey."

You deserve so much more.  You deserve better.  If you truly feel like this is worth saving, then you **must** have a frank and open conversation with him about your wants and needs.  You have to insist that he educate himself and that your physical interactions are reciprocal.  If one of you isn't enjoying themselves, then stop.  If one of you isn't in the mood, you stop.  If he can't deal with that, you need to RUN, not walk away.  

But it sounds like your gut is telling you something.  If he is already over making you cry in physical and emotional pain he is seriously lacking in empathy.  Do you want to be with someone who is ignorant and so insensitive?"

AmItheAsshole,fdrasx8,t1_fdr9oph,1578681853.0,Condoms can break if they are expired and you don't check. They can break if someone tears one when they open the packet.

AmItheAsshole,fdqhr03,t3_emr755,1578666977.0,"**EDIT: After thinking about it and talking with some folks in the comments, I'm updating to ESH. He shouldn't have inferred she was cheating/that the child wasn't his knowing OP's background. But she should have let him know what was going on/her choice to keep or not.**

NTA. People the comments talking about how BC pills and condoms are 98% effective. But they are only that effective if they are used PERFECTLY. And no one is perfect. There are medicines that make the pill ineffective, condoms break, wrong sized condoms can slip off, heat can destroy pill effectiveness etc.

For him to first thing demand a paternity test is really offensive. Especially as you two were friends and he knows your history. Breaking up with someone who hurt you deeply is your choice. Only you know what is best for you.

So good on you for taking care of you."

Based on how you've described your FIL I'd definitely expect for you to get some excuses from him when SO talks to him. If he tries the tired ""it was just a joke/don't be so sensitive/etc."" garbage just cut him off.  Just repeat that what he did was wrong.

If he refuses to apologize or accept that what happened was not okay, maybe consider putting him on a ""time out."" By that I mean if your SO is comfortable with it, he can say ""Dad I am done with this conversation. What you did was not okay in any way, shape, or form. I'm going to give you some time to think about this. Do not contact me or OP for <insert time here> unless you intend to apologize.""

This may sound extreme, but it helps in some situations and gives them time to reflect on their actions. But that's for your SO to decide if he feels comfortable with that. I would suggest to your SO that he certainly not leave you alone with his father ever again for sure though."

His father may overreact or try to play it off as no big deal. DO NOT BUY THIS! Both you and your SO should be a united front on this.

It is certainly not the adult's job to tell a SEVEN YEAR OLD about how they were ASSAULTED.

I strongly suggest mental health checkup/counseling for your son. Because even if he isn't outwardly traumatized, when you're a child, it's very hard to process the idea of outright violence into your/their world. And that's what she did.

As for washing and changing the litter, I scoop every day and do a full litter change every two months. I also feed my kitty wet food and dry food. My girl has allergies to certain proteins so if her foods contain them, her bowel movements are likely to be more smelly and looser/larger. 

I would suggest feeding them a limited ingredient diet with one major protein to see if that helps. It might take up to three months to work out anything in their system. If you don't see an improvement definitely check with your vet!

Edit: if you decide to try a limited ingredient diet, try to pick a protein that isn't super common. Chicken is in most cat foods so they are more likely to develop a sensitivity to it. Venison, rabbit, duck, or lamb would be good choices to try."

I would sit with her and talk to her about this. Really emphasize that she is beautiful and you love her. Tell her ""you're my daughter, and I love you so much that I would never lie to you. So understand I am telling you the absolute truth."" Then tell her that 1) Make up is powerful and so are filters. Nowadays everyone and anyone can edit or alter their appearance to hide imperfections. 2) you may feel like you have to look a certain way to be beautiful but that isn't true. There are as many ways to be beautiful as there are people and body types. 3) even tho you don't see it right now, there are wonderful things about you others probably wish they had. Then specifically point out things on your daughter that are unique and wonderful (maybe her eyes or her hair). And 4) tell her that beauty is nice but that being good and kind is even better. She can be and is beautiful inside and outside.

Remind her when she feels down of these things. Especially 2 and 3 and 4. Also consider therapy for self esteem if this still is an issue as she hits teen years. But for now, having her dad in her corner might be enough. 

I really am rooting for you. I wish my dad had been like you back when I was young. Good luck!

Edited: for correction to typo. Also I meant to say, my dad didnt tell me this when I was young and I wish he did. But he DID tell me something similar when I was struggling in my early 20s.

My dad used to tell me I was faking when I'd have panic attacks or reactions to triggers from my PTSD. I hate, hate HATE when they do that. It makes you feel like you're nuts/defective...

I wish I could tell your dad a thing or two on your behalf!"
Justnofil,fc72blg,t1_fc7192a,1577495658.0,"I can relate. From about ages 15 to 22 that's what my dad did in therapy. He never made me get a story to go in with.  But when the family therapist would give my parents and I concrete things to do, I ended up being the only one who did them.

Got to recognize a problem in self before therapy can do a damn thing..."
Justnofil,fc5tuju,t1_fc5tj2d,1577465753.0,"Yeah, it was a combination of things. Unresolved issues with major family deaths, terrible marriage with my mother (she had/has her own host of issues that she took out on my dad and I), and feelings of inadequacy.

He definitely didnt feel happy or in control of his life. And he projected a lot the anger about it all onto me and my mom.  About 4 years ago he told me all about it and I can understand more now what was going on in his head.

I mean I get it but I dont excuse it. And neither does he which is nice. He never could own up to it all without therapy."
Justnofil,fc5spv7,t1_fc56vc5,1577465017.0,"I know... I fully expected that I'd just never speak to him again. That he decided to get help still shocks me sometimes but I am so glad he took it seriously.

He's a COMPLETELY different person then he was when I was growing up. We've talked about it and he tells me he's trying to make up for lost time.  To be the best dad he can be and he's been surprisingly helpful in my healing. He's also come to some of my therapy sessions too.

It's what I hope for every single person here."
Justnofil,fc5shvi,t1_fc4m0qt,1577464874.0,Thank you. I feel really lucky that it ended up this way. Both my parents ended up in intensive therapy to work through their own trauma/issues. My dad tho is the real miracle story.
Justnofil,fc5sd4m,t1_fc4ulet,1577464789.0,"Honestly that was where I was with my dad. I'd been in individual and family counseling starting age 15. But my parents both viewed it as ""fix my kid. Clearly she is the problem."" I finally hit a point where my therapist said ""I know you want your dad to be x type of person. But he isn't. You need to make the choice to stay or leave that relationship. But you cannot control him or whether he changes.""

And I had put it off for a really long time but then this happened. And I wasnt expecting anything honestly. I assumed that was it and I would just never speak to him again.  That he actually got help shocked me. And sometimes when I think about it, it still shocks me that he went for help.

I hope your dad gets it together and makes good on his words. But if not, I hope you are happy and healthy and find peaceful supportive relationships with others."
AmItheAsshole,fc5l452,t3_eg5c4x,1577460499.0,"NTA. My fiance is allergic to cats and never said ""you cannot bring your cat"" when it came time to move into our new house. 

Those cats have been with you for over a decade. He knew about them, he has interacted with them I assume. So he's being the asshole here."
Justnofil,fc4bo5f,t1_fc4bbvo,1577412021.0,"I am so sorry this happened to you too. And I'm sorry my story triggered you. I'll go back and add a trigger warning to this.

And I might just skip to the end and tell the story of how he became a JYDad from a JN. That is probably the point everyone is curious about anyway."
Justnofil,fc42gt1,t1_fc41rq6,1577404882.0,"I am sure he is better. I went NC with him for 9 months when I was a junior in college. And when I did I wrote a letter to him outlining why I was going NC and that he had to make changes to himself.  I told him I would not have him in my life if he did not make serious changes and seek help for his anger.

He actually took my words to heart and went to intense therapy in the 9 months we were NC. We reconnected and he continued going to therapy for several years. He's now a completely changed person I am happy to say.

So the stories have a happy ending which I plan on posting :)"
relationship_advice,fbxyiws,t3_ef32zs,1577203775.0,"No way are you being selfish. You deserve someone who supports you, your job, and the things you enjoy.

Time for a heart to heart. If he cannot be supportive and tell his family about you, then you need to go. Find someone who can love you without conditions, you deserve it."
JUSTNOMIL,fbx0q5q,t3_eem774,1577165015.0,"Listen, I'm nearly 30 and I do not have kids. I know many people from ages 20 to 67 that do not have kids. NO ONE SHOULD EVER SAY ANY OF THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT A CHILD EVER. 
I have six year old and three year old nieces and if anyone said anything remotely similar I'd put them through a wall. This goes beyond merely inappropriate.

The comments about the five year old girl's hair and selling your son in particular are disgusting. I am beyond horrified. You should not allow any of your children near her until she gets checked out by doctors and psychologists. This woman is clearly sick. Something is very wrong and this is NOT OKAY."
