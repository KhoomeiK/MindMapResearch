offmychest,fez7msf,t3_eqrzyl,1579454523.0,I’m in a similar boat as you. I’m 23 in a week but I lost my dear mum 4 months ago at 22 of a really sudden brain aneurism. She was my very best friend and life without her is very difficult. Missing her will probably never go away but the pain and shock from the loss does go away eventually. Thinking of you at such a difficult time

offmychest,feekn26,t3_eojf0n,1579035671.0,"My mum died 3 months ago of a very sudden brain aneurism where she collapsed into my arms, she was 59. It is so difficult to deal with a death when it is so sudden. I’m not gonna lie missing them never goes away but the pain and shock of their death gets easier with time and you can lock it away for most of the day and get on with things. Thinking of you and your family at such a difficult time and I wish nothing but peace for you."

badwomensanatomy,fdzjiwp,t3_en7ldy,1578790832.0,I honestly thought I was on r/instagramreality for a stupidly long time while reading this post cause godamn she looks plastic!
offmychest,fdzig5u,t3_enfrnu,1578790535.0,"I really missed an ex for about 3 years. We broke up in 2016 after 2 years together and I honestly never stopped loving him but in Feb 2019 I met a guy who I've been with since and I can safely say I am fully over my ex. and I am more in love with him than I ever was with my ex.  It will pass, eventually. I worried it would never ever go away but it did. Just find someone who makes your heart do the same thing it did for your ex."
