If they can only provide 22 GB, that is what they should be able to advertise. I understand it is for all practical purposes a very high value.

As for greed, the article says that not only did Verizon throttle service, they essentially tried to extort the fire service into paying them more money, or else not provide the service. If that's not greed, I don't know what is.

Frankly, it's negligence and greed. We should hold corporations to a higher standard than we do.

> Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan,"" Bowden wrote.

todayilearned,fgiolxx,t1_fgin7mk,1580827326.0,"Per the article, the department had a dedicated account, and only because Verizon demanded more money did the firefighters have to rely so heavily on personal devices. Of course, even if Verizon hypothetically could not identify the fire department (which per the article doesn't seem to be the case), an ethical company could've waived data overages in the vicinity of the fires. Sure, it'd cost them money, but it would be good for the public.

I don't see why you're defending Verizon. This incident rings of hollow greed, and assuredly Verizon does not need your help protecting it.

Patients coming to a hospital are going to be like some sort of poisson random process - events like this are at the very extreme, and it isn't reasonable to designed every system for the (very rare) maximum expected response.

More people and more units will also be within an equal area of an apartment building, and a heating unit for a large, commercially operating building is possible to operate more efficiently than a smaller one.
