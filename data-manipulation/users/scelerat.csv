But only in response to [Clinton first alleging that Sanders was unqualified](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/06/clinton-questions-whether-sanders-is-qualified-to-be-president/). 

Seeing as the only qualifications for President are that the candidate is an American citizen at least thirty five years of age who has not already been twice elected to the office, we were already into the realm of rhetoric. Clinton rhetorically accused Sanders of being unqualified because he ""hadn't done his homework"" on the details of some of his economic proposals. In response, Sanders accused Clinton (rhetorically) of being unqualified because she supported the Iraq war.

Bound tightly to ""electability"" is the notion of inevitability, and that was constantly reinforced every time the news would flash (as early as the earliest announcements of candidacy) of the pledged Superdelegate count, showing (unsurprisingly) Clinton far ahead of Sanders. 

Barraged with this count -- whether or not they could tell you what it actually represented -- the average viewer had a picture painted of Sanders' campaign as a Quixotic adventure.

""Skyrocketing"" needs some quantification. Over the five years [2014-2018, violent crime in Oakland was down 3%, homicides down 12%](https://app.box.com/s/icb4flrew3pdwtlh9apirnae2x79vs9c/file/376923787621).

Not good in the short term obviously. Historically though we're on a downswing.

If it ""seems"" to be skyrocketing it could also be that there are more posts, tweets and articles you've read about crime in Oakland lately."

I certainly understand why it's not a good idea to allow the scenario in question, but in this instance, through their configuration of the course and race start times, the race organizers allowed that scenario to be a possibility. Once the race was underway, they should have allowed the race to complete. If the outcome was not what they envisioned due to unforseen circumstances, I think that's on the race organizers."

There was nothing stopping other women in her race from catching up to the men's race and also drafting. They chose not to. They chose not to attempt to achieve the same advantage she briefly gained by going out hard.

Race planners planned poorly for the women's race. Instead of letting the chips lie where they fell, they chose to stop and restart the women's race. They didn't stop the men's race. They chose renege on the parameters of the women's race mid-race.

Does Iran's policy or its ability to project force in the region diminish now that Solemani is dead? I don't think so. Iraq has unambiguously demanded that American forces withdraw from Iraq. If America leaves, Iran is the greatest military and political power present. If it does not, we have a war on our hands. Either option does not seem like a ""gift"" to either Israel or Saudi Arabia.

Also, the nuclear deal is off. Iran is certainly back on the path to a nuclear weapon.

Russia's interest is in a weakened US generally, and in the middle east specifically and so I halfway expect that the idea to kill Soleimani came from Putin directly. What's happening now is mostly predictable; I don't see how Israel would have requested this ""return"" on their relationship with Trump."
