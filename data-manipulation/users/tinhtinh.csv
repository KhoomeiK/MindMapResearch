Also check European cities but they'll vary in terms of safety especially if you're alone, so if you're happy to not go out much at night, most big cities are pretty safe during the day.

Honestly love the overall vibe of the album and how it flows, will be going back to Circles a lot over the next year and probably whenever I need to sit back a bit and just chill. Once A Day is a perfect final song but fuck me is it heartbreaking.
