ukpolitics,ff8m09u,t1_ff8gj2u,1579685125.0,"Yeah but when people with cancer, life changing injuries, and even mental disabilities are being told they're fit to work, clearly something is wrong. I'm more concerned about the big tax avoiders than a few benefit scroungers. It'd Cost the country less money if the super rich would pay their fucking taxes."
creepyPMs,ff6roz3,t1_ff6n8un,1579633474.0,A nasty man basically.
AskReddit,ff6mshk,t3_erstu3,1579630535.0,I think a burglar is gonna have a bad time when this chubby naked dude comes running at him. Nobody wants that.

Political_Tumor,ff6830e,t1_ff5fwi3,1579621353.0,"I think the argument is more along the lines of him faking bone spurs because he's a coward. He talks a big game, but his cowardly actions prove him wrong."
ukpolitics,ff67nm5,t1_ff5thsq,1579621071.0,"It was simplified before the Tories shook up the whole system. It's costing more to run UC than the previous benefits system. It's not actually designed to help people, it's designed to make people work, by forcing them off the benefits all together. 

It's also widely regarded to be an expensive failure but the Tories are doubling down and causing misery. Just a bunch of selfish conservative bastards really."

HongKong,fe6i74a,t1_fe6g8ub,1578891685.0,"What is a misunderstanding? I didn't specifically refer to anything?
Can't find anything to say it's a business account, or that they failed any kind of test either. Just the police getting involved for 'fraud' Where did you find those things out?"
HongKong,fe6ctaz,t3_ent4ly,1578887188.0,I had no idea that was a thing. If I wasn't permanently stuck in my overdraft I'd definitely go to a different bank. Fuck HSBC.

Advice,fd910jw,t3_ekagek,1578226589.0,"I was in the same situation. It got to a point I'd genuinely think ""if I just stuck my leg out in front of this bus, I'd go to hospital and won't have to go and see her."" Look after your own mental health. You're better off without her. Just break up with.her and inform her parents (forward any messages etc.)
But seriously, you have to be a bit selfish and really just get out of there. 
My ex literally said to me that if I leave she will kill herself there and then, my only response was 'better you than me'"
