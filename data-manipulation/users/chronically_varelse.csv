booksuggestions,fgdpwgi,t3_exrezp,1580685248.0,"Hi welcome! I just always been everyday. I like most genres, probably least biography and romance but there's a few that slip in there too.

I have a really big collection of retro science fiction short story anthologies.

My favorite book is Ishmael. It really gave me a different perspective on what it means to be a human being. 

I still feel kind of lost and alone sometimes but I don't feel like I'm inherently broken. I see myself and other humans differently now, in a way with more understanding. That's in part because of Ishmael / My Ishmael / Story of B."
