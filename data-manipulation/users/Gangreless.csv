* 5000 mg of sodium
* 1000 mg of potassium

**Ketoade**: your best weapon to fight the flu

You'll frequently see people on this sub mention a drink called ""ketoade"" (also sometimes called ""ketorade""). This is not a pre-made drink you can buy, but it is very easy to make and is a great way to get your electrolytes. What's in it? That depends heavily on your own personal needs, but the basic formula is:

**Lite Salt + Water + zero carb flavoring (Mio brand or equivalent)**

Some people also add magnesium and/or extra salt to their mixture. Remember that taking too much potassium or sodium at once can be dangerous so always sip your ketoade!

For more specific ""recipes"" you can always do a search

Mood-wise doing well and keeping my hopes up.
