Sure, but if I feel under the weather or don't want to show up for whatever reason, I shouldn't be penalized solely for not being physically present in class. Yeah, if there was a quiz and I missed it because I felt like watching Netflix instead, that's on me. Or if you cover something that's on the test on the day I was absent and I forget to look over it myself: also on me. 

But if you fail me when I have As on all of my assignments and tests, just because I didn't want to sit through your boring ass PowerPoint reading, that's stupid.

Class and a job are two different things, and believe it or not, we know the difference! It makes sense to get fired for not providing a service (in this case labor) that you're being paid to provide.

My main gripe was with the person who I originally responded to that said ""students don't realize that you have to go to your job everyday hurr durr"". Yes, we do know that. A lot of us DO have jobs to pay for the stupidly high tuition your employers charges us. The difference is that you're a professor at school, not my manager at work. I'm paying for a service in one scenario and in the other I'm getting payed to provide it. It makes sense to get fired if you don't show up to work. It doesn't make sense to get an F in a course if I have As on all of my tests and assignments, but I missed 3 lectures.

The rest of your CS degree will focus on Data Structures and Algorithms as well lower level things like Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. There might be some User Interface design electives but front end development isn't what the CS curriculum is meant to teach you.
Most of these things you won't actually use at work as a software engineer, but you have to learn if you want the degree. (to be fair these classes help you learn to think and solve problems better, as well as give you a deeper understanding of what you're doing, but at the end of the day you're likely not going to use 90% of the things you learn in OS unless you work on some low level team.)

Honestly going to Google is going to look a lot better than GS as far as your resume goes. It's only three months and it's quite obvious you can pass tech interviews, so if you wanted to go to New York for full time I don't think you'd have trouble landing a job there anyway.

cscareerquestions,fciitf2,t1_fcfzuen,1577663257.0,">I'm 36 and making 180k a year as cheif architect and Senior staff engineer at a medium sized startup with lots of room for growth.

I don't get it, is this supposed to be a reason not to grind LeetCode? 

People grind LC so that they can make what you make (or better) at 22. Then by the time they are 36 they'd be making $400-600k+ with an already loaded investment account from making $200k+ for the last 14 years.

You can look at these salaries on levels.fyi to see I'm not exaggerating. The average salary for Big N/FAANG after 10 years is around $400-600k. 

Grinding LC to have the TC of a 36 y/o chief architech and staff engineer at 22 sounds like an incredible investment imo. 

Tbh your comment is more of an argument to grind LC than it is not to."

csMajors,fcdwebt,t1_fccubeg,1577614511.0,">Remove the coursework. Recruiters aren't interested in that. If you really want to, include relevant upper divs like Operating Systems etc, not general classes that every CS majors take, ie. Calculus, Boolean logic, etc

I don't know where you got this information. Every FAANG that has come to our campus has said to put education at the top of your resume along with relevant coursework, especially for underclassmen. FB even said they look for DS&A specifically."
