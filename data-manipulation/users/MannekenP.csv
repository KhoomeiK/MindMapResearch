WayOfTheBern,ffbys6x,t1_ff8l0vr,1579787033.0,"> Smart wealthy people buy everything through the firm and then everything they buy is a company purchase and not subject to VAT
 
That is absolutely not how it works. Companies are not exempt from VAT. When the seller of the yacht/luxury can/whatever will sell the yacht/car, there will be VAT on the price. If the seller is in the EU, buyer will have to pay VAT directly to the fiscal authority of his own country, same if seller is not submitted to VAT.
 
Now the thing is that VAT is a  tax that is paid by the final user, which means that if the company who bought the yacht has its own VAT submitted activity, then it will recuperate VAT to the extent of that new activity. In the case of the yachtt, if the company rents the yacht to a person, that person will pay VAT on the rent and the company owner of the yacht will have the right to offset the received VAT with the VAT it paid when the yacht was purchased.
 
But if the buyer company is just buying the yacht to then lend it to its owner, then the VAT paid on the yacht will be final.
 
So I do not really get that rant about companies not paying VAT. Companies are not exempt from VAT. They may end up recouping the VAT they pay through the VAT they invoice, but only if and when they invoice VAT themselves to their own clients. Which all makes perfect sense as the purpose of VAT is to have a tax paid at the end of the line by the end user."

Ryan starts his career as a banker but begins to invest his own money based on a tip he received from an uncle about the workers' takeover of the Chicago and North Western Railroad.
Then in Patriot Games, Ryan invests in a stock for which he received a tip from Robby Jackson (the firm has developed a new chip that will be used in fighter aircrafts, and when Jackson gives the tip to Ryan, even the firm doesn't know).
I think at some point Ryan is investigated and cleared by the SEC, but from our point of view, we KNOW he is guilty of insider trading.
