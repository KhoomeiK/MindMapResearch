MakeupRehab,fg6of4h,t3_ewzp40,1580573155.0,Wow- good job on catching yourself! I’ve basically forced myself to not buy until one of my items get used up or expires now. I use to fall into the trap of feeling the NEED to buy everything around the holidays because it all goes on sale and comes in so many pretty holiday packaging. And then one day I looked around and realized that I am unable to catch up to using everything because there’s so much. This was a pattern that went on for several years.  I started cutting down in 2018 and Last holiday season was my first successful season of not buying anything.
u_AlphaMuziq,fg50kem,t3_ewtt07,1580515345.0,wow- I know everyone has said this already but I was totally imagining something crazy too but your hair looks fine! Stylish and clearly well taken care of! Don't know what your friend's deal is.
LifeProTips,fg4cio6,t3_ewfb50,1580500846.0,I had a cool coworker who navigated me to a private room. This room is for the mothers who need to pump but it's also available for others who need it. They put one of these rooms on all our floors because you never know when someone needs a private space.
LifeProTips,fg4c375,t3_ewqdc3,1580500582.0,"I personally do not like this recommendation because it's just spreading germs in a different spot (clothes) and then I see people acting like they didn't do it or FORGET, and then think they can come and get a hug?? No I don't want a hug from your germmy inner elbows! I'm also the type that keeps tissues everywhere so that I can dispose germs right away after sneezing/coughing into them. I believe people should make more of an effort to grab a tissue! If I'm near a sink, I WILL USE MY HAND - because I can always wash them right away. No germmy inner elbows and a clean shoulder for my loved one to rest their head."

thebachelor,ffvry8d,t1_ffvji95,1580271556.0,Same! I just commented something similar in another thread yesterday! It’s almost hard to watch Peter sometimes because you can tell he’s following the direction of the producers to cause drama.
thebachelor,fftzhao,t1_fftfejx,1580231118.0,I think I’m entertained knowing that this is all planned drama by the producers and I can’t help laughing every time I see Peter carrying out what the producers want. It’s so awkward sometimes because I can just see it on his face that he has to let it happen and isn’t going to stop it as it’s good for the show.
