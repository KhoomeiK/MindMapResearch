Our friend had one and we wanted them more than anything. These dolls were like $100 a piece.

AmItheAsshole,ffvxwnl,t3_ev8mcg,1580276693.0,"YTA. You left her at the airport?? That’s fucked up man. Everyone has different skills and flaws. Your gf has no life experience and isn’t interested enough in fixing that. That sucks. But you have flaws too, flaws that she probably hasn’t left you stranded at the airport for. Not checking the passport was just a silly oversight. She wasn’t rude to you, she was just being a little dumb. If her not knowing how to change her oil or think to check her passport for the date is a deal breaker for you, something that takes away your respect for her, then break up with her. But if you don’t want to do that, you need to stop being so judgmental and treat her with respect. The most important thing in a relationship, more than attraction or passion or even love, is respect. If you don’t have respect you’re doomed. And it honestly doesn’t sound like you respect her."

I don’t think silly gender cliches are harmful. They’re just meant in good fun.

She even steals money out of my wallet to pay for her cats ballet lessons, and I just don’t think that’s a very important cause compared to me paying rent.

That’s not an example of inconsistency not being a problem in movies, because it doesn’t come across as an inconsistency. I thought they did that knowing they wanted Vader to be Luke’s dad. Whereas the stuff in the sequels actually doesn’t make sense in the universe. If force healing was a thing, it would’ve changed a lot about the movies. Anakin could’ve saved his mom and padme, which would’ve taken the main reasons he ever went to the dark side. So no darth Vader, and if anakin hadn’t sided with palpatine hoping palpatine could help him save padme, windu would’ve been able to kill palpatine and the empire might not have even existed, which obviously would’ve made the original trilogy obsolete.

My mom was afraid to tell me and my sister, and she said she even thought about waiting until we were 18 to tell us because she couldn’t bear to see us go through that loss. Obviously that would’ve been the wrong choice, but my mom is the best mom in the world and she still felt that instinct to spare us the truth to protect us. It’s okay to feel that way.
