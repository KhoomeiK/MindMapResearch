ImGoingToHellForThis,ffjizx7,t1_ffj26q4,1579999303.0,"You've just described why the dating market swings in men's favor from about 28+. 

From around 18-28, women can take their pick among men because guys all the way up to 60+ would still all love to hook up with a young attractive woman. At that age, women have *many* more dating options than men. 

All that changes in the late 20s. The women who've never been married and have no kids are feeling their biological clocks ticking. The women who already have kids are carrying baggage that most guys their own age have no desire to deal with, and those who are divorced are now afraid they're going to end up alone. A 30 year old woman, regardless of how attractive she is, simply doesn't carry the same sugar baby appeal to older guys and will start to see her dating pool shrink to an age range much closer to her own age. Men, on the other hand, aren't losing their ""sugar baby"" status as they age, and don't have a biological clock. If a 40 year old guy decides he wants kids, he has to find a woman significantly younger than he is unless he wants to deal with a heightened risk of Downs or other birth defects inherent that comes with a woman giving birth after around age 35."

I tested myself for shits and giggles after reading the article and found Ukraine on my first try based on the exact factor you described - I knew it was a larger country on Russia's Western border, and I knew it had to be near water because of the ""Crimean Peninsula.""

>1. The iphone x cost nearly twice as much as the pixel 2. So going from $1070 (after tax) to $265 and $640 to $61 isn't that big a gap (75% vs 90% loss)

Not that big a gap? The iPhone retained 2.5 times as much of its original value compared to the pixel. That's *massive*.

>1. Google are always running promos and discounts which accounts for part of the depreciation. The consumer needs to be savvy enough to take advantage of that rather than pay full price. Iphones are hardly ever discounted.

Think about that. Apple doesn't need to discount its phones to move units - Google does. Even though Apple's phones start off significantly more expensive."
