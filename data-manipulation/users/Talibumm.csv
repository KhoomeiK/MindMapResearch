unpopularopinion,fdst28z,t3_emvzt0,1578707576.0,"So true in my opinion. It’s the people who are humorless who try make things awkward or uncomfortable. My mom had cancer when I was growing up and I made little jokes about it and it made her smile. “Hey mom, they just announced Tumor seasons of your favorite show” it made her laugh and if I made that joke with others it was just grim, it turned into an awkward moment where I would’ve been shamed even though it was something that my mom laughed at."
