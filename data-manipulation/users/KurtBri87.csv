Unfortunately its not far enough up that i cant hear you, maybe i should go further."
fatlogic,feo1lz7,t1_fenoel3,1579293910.0,"God doesn’t exist, but you are one pathetic excuse of a human being. How do you stand with no spine?"
fatlogic,fen06i1,t1_felaak8,1579274008.0,"Maybe because you only have control over the way you behave and not others. So learn to control aspects of your life that you can and learn to deal with those you can’t. 

But then again, please continue to enlighten me on how taking peoples words, literally sounds that they make to communicate, and turning them into a physical act that hurt you and now calling it violence. 

Just because most people can’t control their emotions and how they let things effect them, doesn’t make me wrong in the least bit. It just shows that most people don’t have what it takes to control themselves and you as a fool for siding with the people who aren’t mentally tough enough to keep their head up, when others create something as harmless as sounds from from their mouth and they let it break them down."
fatlogic,fel93oe,t1_fel4cv7,1579216742.0,"To someone who doesn’t get it, yeah I would totally see where you are coming from. But I can promise I only allow the real stress in life to stress me, you can create your own heaven or hell. 

And that is looking to my future, because I’m not dwelling on what someone said in the past. So very ignorant of you to call someone who has control of their emotions myopic."
fatlogic,fel3sed,t1_fel30yz,1579213442.0,"Thats literally the key to life, dont take it to heart. You can say whatever you want to me, if im not going to let it bother me, then thats the end of it. Its up to me to say that offended or hurt me."
fatlogic,fel27b4,t1_fel06fx,1579212456.0,"I took that directly from Webster on google and all alternative definitions are along the same line, with not one saying anything about words. Cambridge has that as an “added” definition. The correct and legit one is the first. Which lists violence as a forceful act intended to hurt others 

Just because it’s added to the definition to make sensitive people feel better doesn’t mean it’s the real meaning. So once again, violence is a physical act that can’t be ignored, words can be very much be ignored and require the individual to take it to heart"
ihavesex,fekvi15,t3_eppfby,1579208453.0,"Well....I had sex TODAY, felt so good I spend two hours in the gym because I attempt to appear to be healthy. Then I have to go bang this job out real quick for $1000 and then I get to hang with a group of porn stars tomorrow and have a orgy with them. Is that enough or should I have done more with my life?"
fatlogic,fekue5u,t3_epp4wg,1579207802.0,"Violence - behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something.

Words cannot be violence in any way shape or form. So please keep telling me how my discussion about my progress, caused physical violence, which in turn caused you to eat a dozen Ring Dings emotionally and “forget” that you even ate them. Leading you to complain about cutting calories doesn’t work."
fatlogic,fehp4tl,t3_ep81sg,1579121067.0,Yes because your body is programmed to smash a box of devil dogs every night just to keep your weight up.
fatlogic,fdr961u,t3_emu6jp,1578681150.0,I always imagine the person writing these to be extremely out of breath and sweaty after finishing this.
amiugly,fdqyc61,t1_fdqpk1j,1578676689.0,"I can say that every single person who posts on here says that they are working on losing weight. As someone who lost 140lbs, I don’t believe you. Stop “working” on it and start just doing it then. You are on the defense about your weight and anyone who’s actively trying to change, wouldn’t take offense to the obvious."
fatlogic,fdqlfc7,t1_fdpbv71,1578669484.0,"It’s no hypothesis here, this is the real deal. I drive a subaru WRX, which is a smaller sporty car. I got it before I lost the weight. When I first bought it, I had the seat all the way back and the back of the seat reclined, but my legs were still close to the dashboard. 

Now I move the seat up, sit the back more upright and have a lot of room before my knees hit the dash. Like it went from 2” of clearance to about 4”-5”, which is a big difference."
fatlogic,fdnn8as,t3_embv46,1578589309.0,"First rule of Self Esteem club, is if you claim that you are large, in charge and have high self esteem...you are most likely a fragile person who hates themselves. 

Can’t fool those who actually have good esteem."
fatlogic,fdkkpwn,t1_fdkcdqs,1578505601.0,"I would just turn the discussion from the fat I lost, to the fat they found then. Since they want the discussion to be all about them let’s keep it about them and how they are still fat."
fatlogic,fdkk1b2,t3_eluim9,1578505259.0,"Ok so I won’t talk about weight loss anymore. 

Let’s just discuss all the fun and active things I can do that you can’t then."
fatlogic,fdkjss4,t3_elu79r,1578505145.0,What punches are they going to throw? A swing or two would have them out of breath and down for the count.
fatlogic,fdkj4gl,t1_fdkiri6,1578504812.0,"Believe it or not, when in shape my legs sit different and take up less room. So I have room for my legs and plenty of width in the seat to sit back and relax.

It wasn’t the same when I was heavier."
fatlogic,fdkirrt,t3_elvq0i,1578504636.0,"Well they don’t understand how calories work and I would consider that simple knowledge compared to medicine and the body, so what did you expect?"
fatlogic,fdki4ai,t3_elvm3e,1578504311.0,"I am a 6’5 man who lost 140lbs

It’s been three years and I have been able to keep the weight off due to my lifestyle changes I took in the first place.

I have yet to lose any height though, no matter how hard I try. 

So I don’t think it’s fair to compare weight with height. In fact my argument, when trying to buy clothes, is that it’s easier to be a fat person than it is to be tall and athletic. I can’t find clothes for shit but there is always an array of xl-xxxxls on the rack.

fatlogic,fdhw9x5,t3_elhicv,1578431301.0,"I totally get where this person is coming from. It’s tough to give up food and face your fear of feeling hungry all the time. The problem is they never give it a good attempt to find out that restrictions soon turn into the norm and they are no longer restrictions. You have to have a lifestyle change and allow yourself to settle into it. It’s not all about cutting calories, so they are partially right about that, but they can’t see past calories to understand how it really works."
