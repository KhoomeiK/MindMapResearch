It's fun to see how the show evolved, and there is enough self-reference (although not nearly as much as Drag Race) that you will want to know the history."

spartanrace,ff7fq9q,t3_es2o53,1579648505.0,"I would almost recommend shortening the break between races, actually. Give yourself an hour to eat, hydrate and stretch, then get back out there so nothing tightens up too much. Train like it's one long event, practice that break refuel plan in advance. And yes, take your time with both races and have fun :)"

They don't make you show up with the wedges to prove it, because just possessing the wedges doesn't prove anything (could be stolen? Who knows).

spartanrace,ff0zvvy,t3_er1lla,1579473881.0,"I think the insurance covers Spartan in case of catastrophic, Spartan-caused injury (ex: obstacle collapse due to poor construction). Most injuries would be covered by the waiver. It is possible that the insurance also covers people who are literally taken from the course by ambulance while unconscious (i.e. unable to consent in the moment to treatment). But if, for example, you hurt your knee and needed physical therapy afterward, you'd be shit outta luck, because you signed a waiver and would be unable to prove that you acutely injured yourself on course anyway."

fatlogic,feymi6x,t1_feylomy,1579447592.0,"It's more efficient but it also takes longer. I think running burns more calories than walking per mile but not by a ton (maybe 20% or so). If I remember my exercise science correctly, once you get faster than 12 min/mile walking it actually becomes LESS efficient than running (because of the hip movement required)."

spartanrace,fevu2hf,t3_eqqa89,1579401509.0,"Running on any kind of less stable surface is better than nothing, so I would seek out maybe some muddy terrain or grass (the taller the better) to run through, if you have it. Doing ankle/leg stability and balance exercises will help for a sandy venue, and make sure you are fully stocked with electrolytes before and during the race to avoid cramps. The great thing about sand is it is easy on the joints, although the lower leg muscles will definitely take a hit :)"
