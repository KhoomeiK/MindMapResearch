I'm 21M from India. I work as a production coordinator at an animation studio. Big time cinephile. Want to get into gaming as well.

Maybe we both can suggest each other movies and games? Feel free to DM."
virgin,fdrrkjy,t3_emsm9y,1578688675.0,"Stop taking things seriously. Just chill and enjoy even more than you're doing. Maybe loosen up a bit more. 

Reach out to people who you think need you, because they actually need you and you'll regret once they're gone.

Pump the brakes on soda and midnight snacks. For god sakes please!!! That fucking belly is not easy to go away! And things are going to be fucking epic beyond your expectations so keep goin bud!"

depression_help,fddy91i,t3_ektbx2,1578326886.0,"I guess people like us wallow in self pity and will never be able to forgive ourselves unless someone else does. It will take a lot of strength, but I suggest you go completely vulnerable with your parents and all the people you feel like you've let down.

We often underestimate people when it comes to their patience and understanding. I'm really sure they will forgive you and help you forgive yourself.

I actually tried it and that person is closest to me than anyone. I feel really safe around her and I suggest you to do the same.

Stay strong and if you feel like venting know that I'm here."
depression,fddstty,t1_fddsl4b,1578323087.0,"Also I feel like you're comparing yourselves to other. I don't know you and I feel like I'm kind of overjudging you but if that's actually the case, I suggest to move at your pace. Everyone has their own timeline and 10 years from now if you'd look back, it will all feel very insignificant in the bigger scheme of things. Again stay strong, we're all rooting for you."
depression,fddsl4b,t3_ekqsl7,1578322904.0,"Wow and I used to think if I were a woman I'd be more social and have more friends, but after hearing your story it has changed my retarded perspective. I know how it is to be that lonely and have friends who have their own love lives and busy work schedules so if you ever want someone to talk or vent, I'm always here. Stay healthy and positive and maybe try getting a hobby or interest, it really helped my depressed ass to stay happy. 

Also it gets better. Trust me."
virgin,fd8mhoc,t3_ekar40,1578220221.0,"I can tell you about me, lots of other guys may have different stance and preference than me which is fine. I watch a lot of porn and 1) it's just for the purpose of getting me off and 2) I've always been interested in the lives and psychology of sex workers in general.


That being said, I'm never a fan of how they portray an unrealistic version of human body and honestly I think I prefer natural bodies however they are. But since I'm a virgin and have never seen a woman/man naked other than me, I can't say how I will react to the other person.

Honestly it's just about the person I guess. The reason I've stayed virgin and lonely for so long is that I've a hard time connecting with people, if I connect with someone emotionally I guess their physical form won't matter that much anyways."

lonely,fd3j26j,t3_ejxew7,1578158802.0,"What about online dating? I've heard that after a certain age online dating is not about how Women can get laid with a guy that like easily, but it's more of ""yeah we're over with looks and all of that jazz, let's just get someone to fill void in our lives and escape the societal pressure"". Is that just a false notion? If that's the case then maybe I'm completely fucked."

As in he would've not been as patient and understanding with you as he was? Don't get me wrong, he sounds like an amazing dude, just curious to know that's all. And btw congrats and hope you guys have fun and stay safe ;)"

depression_help,fd325a4,t3_ejy5n9,1578154033.0,"Yo I relate to your story for most part. Are you an Indian? Because it sounds like India where your diploma makes or breaks career ideology is prevalent. Anyhow, I also did edit my grades to fool my parents. I did feel like I fucked up my career not just once but multiple times. Now I'm probably as same age as you or a bit younger if not but turns out all that worrying I always did back in uni days weren't even necessary. I'm the youngest person in my organisation and I'm paid more money than most in my team at similar position. The career probably will never be an issue for me because my marks didn't matter, as long as I work as I love doing it.


Maybe all you need is someone to be transparent about this stuff. If the friends you mentioned are on the same page as you are maybe they're not of much help and you may feel your gf may not be able to relate to you entirely because she's done her doctorate and all so find someone who gets you. You can shoot me a dm anytime you feel like talking.


And bruh career should be least of someone's problem if you ask me. You're really worth more to this world than you think with or without a career."

virgin,fd2iqu3,t1_fd2g9rc,1578147820.0,"That doesn't sounds good, looks like it's gonna take a while. I don't have a problem being single/virgin my entire life tho. It's just people around me react like I am a massive loser or something? Dude like can't they see I'm a complete mess, I'm out of shape, emotionally I'm incapable of having a relationship how tf do you see me as someone who has ever gotten laid? Like fr. And besides this I'm really good at lots of other things in life. I feel like for 21y/o I've done pretty well for myself but because my life went this way, I didn't became as social as I should've. Wish people were more accepting I guess."

ForeverAloneDating,fd29omq,t3_ejw5cz,1578143874.0,"You sound interesting and about my age as well. I will be 22 in April.

I'm a big movie buff. I'm extremely passionate about movies and trying to make it in the industry as well. I'm kind of antisocial but not an extreme case. I can hold a conversation pretty well but I'm just inherently an awkward individual. I just want to connect with someone there are only few people that I do.

Also I'm looking for some anime recommendation, maybe you can dm me if you want and we can start from there I guess? 

In any case, hope you find what you're looking for :)"

lonely,fcxb2g2,t3_ej92xi,1578057912.0,Man I'm almost the same. I feel like I can gather people's attention and intrigue quite easily but because I'm always skeptical that if I start talking they may find me weird so I don't go overtly extrovert on them and they find me as someone with massive attitude and someone who thinks he's above them. But it's exactly opposite of that. Maybe if I have some friends all this will change? Who knows?
