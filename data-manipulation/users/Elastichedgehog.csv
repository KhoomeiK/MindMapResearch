The combat is pretty bad, feels like you're slashing air, there's no sense of weight. While the world if beautiful the game does become repetitive with a large proportion of your time spent inside samey looking caves. Stealth archer is by far the best build, it's pretty broken. Magic isn't great, but that can be fixed with mods (like most of the games issues). The UI is clearly designed for a controller (get SkyUI if you buy it). Bugs are common because Bethesda has no idea what they're doing with the Creation Engine, not as bad as Oblivion though. For a game so massive the voice acting cast is incredibly small, a common issue for ES games.

To clarify I ***DO RECOMMEND*** the game, just points worth considering. It's much better on PC because a lot of the issues you have can be fixed with mods.
