This was in the same year and after they were caught in another scandal giving out as many as 500k bad vaccines to young children and babies. They made hundreds of millions of profit doing this. The Judge fined the business and removed their licenses so they basically had to dissolve and shut down. But since this is China, the guys at the top likely got away rich and clean and are starting up another medical company.

From what I heard, even the exchange students cheat a lot in the US universities. I have a lot more experience with Saudi students because my major is filled with them. In my experience, they are terrible people. They chain smoke and the vast majority are dumb as bricks. They have no chance of passing their courses so they cheat as much as they can in every course until they get lucky and pass. They usually come from wealthy backgrounds so they toss money at the college and the colleges let them stay when they get caught cheating (although they still fail the course).

First off, while they learn to cram more information quickly, they have zero creative thinking and don't know how to solve critical thinking problems unless shown how to do them. For example, they might memorize some equations and know how to do some simple calculations, but if you tell them to design a motor, they won't know how to approach the problem without looking up information from someone who does. Also, because of how competitive their education system is, they have massive fraud and cheating among their academics, from faking degrees at degree mill colleges, to stealing research papers and faking results. It's so bad that nearly any paper published from China is taken with a grain of salt and highly scrutinized. They have hundreds of submissions of fake or stolen work, and of those more than 100 a year get published and then later removed once caught. For reference, more than half of all submitted Chinese research papers get removed for faking results. I believe the amount of published research they get removed for cheating is more than every other country in the world combined.

Saying racial slurs and badmouthing other ethnic groups (especially Japan, Philippines, etc.). Examples I've seen are, claiming the Japanese are monkeys who bully the Chinese and steal their land among other things. A big one is the promotion of traditional Chinese medicine.
