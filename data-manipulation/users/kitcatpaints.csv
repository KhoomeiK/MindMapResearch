AskReddit,ff56dyf,t3_erpj2f,1579581526.0,"My smile!! Which, I guess, is my mouth :)"
AskReddit,fecrkvv,t3_eohakb,1578981953.0,7! (4 big and 3 smaller decorative ones that I tuck all around me to be comfy)
AskReddit,fecqr4j,t1_fecqk7w,1578981141.0,Thank you SO much!
AskReddit,fecqa53,t1_fecq2t2,1578980698.0,"Thanks. All good. Just some hard work ahead (grad school, parenting with no other adult in the house, working, moving at month end). Just a lot all at once and requires work and less sleep for a bit maybe :) School was particularly challenging today as all the assignments and readings became clear, highlighting just how much work is ahead of me the next ten weeks."
AskReddit,fecpyxe,t1_fecprq9,1578980416.0,I hope yours improves sooner rather than later. Thanks for thinking of others while you’re struggling <3
Showerthoughts,fecpxa9,t1_fecpt5i,1578980376.0,"It’s funny. I totally agree and was looking at it from that perspective and population. I work in them and have two kids in middle school. They sound like snotty, judgemental jerks to me when I hear it and I can’t imagine they’re making many friends when they berate each other saying what they like is cringey."
AskReddit,fecpnv2,t3_eogzh0,1578980145.0,"Not even a bit ok but typing that out helps me remember that anytime I’ve felt that way, I’ve been ok in the end. So thank you for asking!!
How are you?"
Showerthoughts,fecp5a0,t3_eogw0p,1578979687.0,I totally feel that way!! It sounds so judgemental and pretentious
happy,fe6bryg,t1_fe6b6cx,1578886411.0,Great choice. Keep on doing what makes you happy. All a part of the process and you’re clearly rocking it :)
happy,fe6aprb,t3_enxfl4,1578885634.0,"Ohhh it’s so pretty!  It’s the exact colour of my daughter’s fav scrunchie :)
Also yay for learning a new skill!"
space,fe0ca1a,t3_enjw4t,1578809522.0,That’s incredible!  Beautiful capture.
AskReddit,fdk2guz,t3_eltiww,1578494430.0,Ask the women.
AskReddit,fdjbl6z,t3_elot6m,1578464345.0,"Definitely relationships. I think that’s what makes life  rich, at the risk of sounding cheesy."
AskReddit,fdjayqv,t1_fdjaqm2,1578463732.0,"Ha! And likely never will again. There were many spiders. Charlotte the first, 2nd, 3rd, 42nd...haha!"
AskReddit,fdjawwm,t1_fdjargq,1578463683.0,Thank you!!
AskReddit,fdjab7s,t3_eloml4,1578463102.0,Bit my toenails. On purpose. To gross out my sister. Or would have a spider attach to a stick And toss it off the balcony like a fishing line and pull it back up. I’d cry and frantically search the bushes below if *goodness knows why* it would jump ship on me.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdgxzex,t1_fdgxttv,1578411081.0,"Oh wow, would you look at that?!  Thank you."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdgwsd3,t3_elcrpg,1578410254.0,"I don’t know but I’m following. I assume a strong pelvic floor and uterus muscle.  I can almost push a tampon out once it’s first in just because mud been inserted and my body naturally does that. 
I had an overactive uterus (contractions) during pregnancies. I have a healthy sex life so it’s not that I’m ‘too tight’ as some people may say. It’s annoying what happens with the tampon though"
sex,fdgui1c,t1_fdgdwjx,1578408645.0,"My hope is that once the jump reaction ends, some of your intent sinks in. It’s a tough one, because he’s sensitive about a perceived fault. May take some time with you really hitting home with the love and intimacy piece and less about ‘fucking’. I’m sorry that your well meaning talk went sideways. 

As my partner would say, who does this conversation benefit??  I’d say you and your guy because you wouldn’t be harbouring some toxic seed that grew. My guy would probably say it benefitted only you because it smoothed your feelings. And that *may* be a difference between men and women."
sex,fdfqn4o,t3_el5cx8,1578367856.0,"That’s a sucky way that went down like that. I’m sorry you walked away with this added weight. To be honest, it sounds like you communicated really well; better than I could’ve expressed myself when I need to know something so I don’t make a huge colossal issue out of it on my own. 

I’m female so maybe this is where I don’t understand the problem.  I get that if he has his own anxiety surrounding performance and interpreted your ‘perception checking’ as another form of dissatisfaction with his performance, that he’d be upset. I also see you trying to have open dialogue as positive. Is he someone who needs time to process or is reactionary when he feels criticized??"
offmychest,fcvumb4,t1_fcuojpo,1578010468.0,"I love your edits, including your stepmom and acknowledging that your movements have just been living life and learning. I’m divorced after a dramatic breakup, took four years to get divorced officially, returned to university while raising two kids and had all the messiness that comes with those things. I Could read between your lines and read the humanness within your post.  You’re ‘my people’ and I love that there are people like you that exist and have these gifts."
offmychest,fcvhrgw,t1_fcv5379,1578002352.0,Totally. Look at her profile and it’s confirmed. She’s my people.
offmychest,fcuoqd0,t1_fcuojpo,1577985469.0,I’d say so. Your daughter is lucky to have such an incredible pair of role models in her mom and grandpa!!  Best wishes to you!
offmychest,fcuo3ve,t3_ej0ww8,1577985112.0,"You sound rad and independent and responsible as you face your challenges head on. Clearly, you got some of your radness from your dad!!  Congrats!! This is amazing!!"
AskReddit,fcm3i04,t3_ehx5m4,1577763274.0,All sorts of things. Usually during high stress times and I don’t even know what exactly I’m crying about. Or if I haven’t cried in a bit I am more likely to cry at the end of sex. Great double whammy release.
sex,fcj2rdd,t3_ehfulj,1577675826.0,"Sometimes it’s because I’m so into it, sometimes because I’m self conscious, sometimes because it breaks my focus and becomes a stare down, sometimes because without my glasses when I can’t see ... all of the above happens...but it’s all gotten easier with time and confidence.  Plus he tells me how hot it is and how beautiful I am and fantasizes about it etc etc.  Talk it up, talk her up, tell her how good she is at it and show her how pleasured you are the instant that she looks up at you."
wholesomememes,fc6crnf,t3_egg517,1577477521.0,This made me tear up. These are the small things that are HUGE!  Actually Noticing someone <3
pics,fb38bxq,t1_fb384ug,1576466606.0,Very slowly.  Not going to lie. My palms are sweaty. Haha!
