ShitAmericansSay,fft7thg,t1_fft3sw5,1580211366.0,I've spent large portions of my life in both the US and UK and find myself thinking that depressingly often about both countries.
politics,fft73dw,t1_ffscgpo,1580210447.0,"It also makes sense if you interpret his concern less as ""oh no Trump is doing something illegal"" and more ""oh no, Trump is a fucking moron and is going to get us all exposed for the illegal shit we've been doing."""

pics,ffsch13,t1_ffrjwvg,1580178416.0,There are a few comments in here about husbands passing it specifically during the epidural. I had one with my first labor...does it look especially brutal or something?
pics,ffsc9o3,t1_ffrf8e0,1580178279.0,"Yup. My first labour was natural--31 hours from ""this is the real thing"" to baby in arms.

Second was an induction, two weeks overdue. 1.5 hours from IV to baby.

I used to lament my long labour, until I realised the alternative is packing the same amount of pain into a very short window. It was fucking INTENSE and I am never doing it again."

pics,ffsbypn,t1_ffrxbzw,1580178078.0,"Aww, your poor mom. The guilt in situations like that is so unwarranted but so real."
startrek,ffp95nl,t1_ffp7v33,1580089289.0,Thank you! I tried that right after I posted that comment and it worked. I definitely should be asleep right now but I watched it anyway and I'm glad I did. The clip from next week's show has me so emotional.
