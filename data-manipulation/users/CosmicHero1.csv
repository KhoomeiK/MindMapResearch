I wonder why you’re getting tired of people so soon. Are you meeting the type of people that you want to hang out with? Do you share similar interests?

Even if I have similar interests with friends, I tend to get tired of people after 4-6 hours then I need to go home and be by myself for a bit to recharge. I try to bring up (or contribute to) a conversation topic that I know will spark discussion that will create some kind of lasting connection. If there’s nothing to go on it could be something as simple as a recent book/movie that you have consumed and asking them if they have read/seen it. If you’re lucky they will have and they will share their opinion about the book/movie which will in turn create more momentum for the conversation. If they haven’t you can tell them what you liked about it (without spoilers) and recommend it to them and they may recommend something that they have read/seen in response. Next time that you see them, you can share in that.

You would be surprised how much you have in common with people once you put yourself out there a bit more and how enriched your conversations become"

That is rough though if it is widely adopted as in your case though"
