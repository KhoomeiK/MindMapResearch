CleaningTips,ff51qw8,t1_ff4g51v,1579577876.0,I definitely considered it
CleaningTips,ff41bt5,t1_ff3z8rg,1579553391.0,Yeah
CleaningTips,ff41b55,t1_ff4046s,1579553380.0,Thank you!
CleaningTips,ff3wf57,t1_ff3w789,1579550324.0,I bought it several states away because I bought pre owned (searches far and wide for a good deal to get my first luxury car) I guess I could take it to the dealership here but i bet it will cost a fortune!
CleaningTips,ff3w8p7,t1_ff3vxjw,1579550214.0,I can’t believe they would do this! I spent weeks looking for this car. It’s the nicest one I’ve ever had
nsi_189,ff2diu7,t3_epzgyq,1579501752.0,I wish I knew the answer but I was wondering if you could post or dm me where you got it
insaneparents,fezpsi9,t1_femfuyj,1579460138.0,"He’s so proud the men can swing a hammer so that makes him better than women?? Lmao. Ok buddy. A monkey can do that too so congrats on that, lughead."
TwoXChromosomes,fet3vqc,t3_eq71a6,1579371578.0,Beautiful!! Congrats! You deserve it!
TwoXChromosomes,fet337w,t1_ferkdfu,1579371332.0,"I don’t think the dads care as much about stuff. They’ve gotten much better at caretaking and interacting with their kids, but there’s still a ways to go. And if there’s even a hint of the “woman’s work” attitude then it’s not gonna go well after a baby enters the picture. K think there’s also a disconnect when it comes to being able to feel and show emotion so it really seems like they don’t care. My fiancé is awesome but I really don’t think another kid is in the cards... things are going really well and I just don’t know if I’m willing to risk that"
TwoXChromosomes,feqdm72,t1_fee6erb,1579340516.0,I asked my fiancé why he shaved and he couldn’t tell me either! The beard is back and I’m loving it
TwoXChromosomes,feqde7b,t1_fee0w3a,1579340412.0,Dude so you’re saying we are literally conditioned to do this thing and y’all don’t even notice? If y’all don’t even notice then why have we been convinced that we must shave it all in order to not be gross? And why are women’s razors more expensive? Whyyyy
menwritingwomen,feppyaq,t1_feppced,1579327400.0,Ha ok that makes wayyyy more sense
TwoXChromosomes,fep8qwu,t3_eotxhs,1579314665.0,I had a homeless man chase me down the street the other day. People don’t believe me with this shit but it’s true.
AreTheStraightsOK,fep8ir4,t1_fep6brr,1579314523.0,Right? It’s so weird. He’s surprised me a few times with some of this stuff. Recently he got really mad at me for being a diva saying I’d rather have heated leather seats instead of just leather. He took that as me being a huge brat. First of all so what if I am. Second of all how dare he assume that instead of just asking me what the deal was. I could have explained that I’m not looking to freeze my ass off all winter so duh of course I want heated. If I can’t have heated I want cloth. It’s literally that simple. Why they have to act like we’re so unreasonable and like it’s hilarious to make fun of us is beyond me
AreTheStraightsOK,fep5v7g,t1_fep5dqu,1579312813.0,Right? Like wtf. My fiancé loves me a lot but even he’s done this. I had to ask him to stop. It’s like they think it’s a funny way to bond with other dudes... so it makes me feel super shitty when it happens
TwoXChromosomes,fep3dnm,t1_feg1lhk,1579311229.0,Mine pretends like he was “just agreeing with me”. Oh ok so instead of saying ok you feel the need to restate everything I just said in a way that sounds like an explanation. Now your explanations to me are just gaslighting the fact that you fucking explained something I had literally just said. It’s a complete mindfuck.
TwoXChromosomes,fep2q6d,t1_feej2vk,1579310815.0,"My soon to be husband has been doing this. I’m into redoing my home at the moment and explain how certain things should be done and he’s been totally dismissive. Then he goes to the hardware store to ask a man and comes home and explains the exact same fucking thing to me that I already told him. I just... he’s not a bad dude like he’s the least shitty of them all, but it’s been eye opening and disappointing. Makes me want to say fuck off do it all alone then"
TwoXChromosomes,fep2gw3,t1_fefpv6v,1579310652.0,"That’s not too surprising. It’s something I don’t relate to, being trans, so maybe that’s why I never under why a man would want to become a woman. They have it better and literally don’t have to try."
TwoXChromosomes,fep275h,t1_feehz4d,1579310476.0,This is spot on. It is so disappointing and has really taken a lot of joy out of my life. It’s an odd thing to just realize that not only do you dreams and goals not seem to matter to the majority in charge. And if they’re nice to me it’s because I’m attractive. What a joke. I don’t really try anymore. It’s shitty but I do not expect to find a lot of joy anymore. I just try my hardest to filter the bullshit out for my daughter so she doesn’t have to feel alone or kinda dead inside :(
TwoXChromosomes,fep1i8h,t1_fef5ypa,1579310041.0,I don’t know if I’ll ever shake imposter syndrome. Being made to feel like I’m not important has really screwed up every area of my life.
TwoXChromosomes,fep1596,t1_fef4uu4,1579309813.0,My dad is like that too. He thinks I’m sneaky and secretive when really I just don’t want to talk to him very much because I don’t have anything to say that he would be interested in hearing.
Showerthoughts,feocs4c,t1_feng17a,1579298279.0,Ugh that’s so messed up. Why would they do that?
TwoXChromosomes,fenkeyx,t1_fejb2z0,1579286585.0,Why would they change on their own? They don’t care and it’s not important to them. I agree though.... it’s not fair. I’d say if you’re going to try and get them to change it will have to be because women made it happen. It’s so frustrating.
TwoXChromosomes,fenk02j,t1_fejok6y,1579286337.0,Some help but we have to request it. It would be so nice not to feel not so overwhelmed sometimes. I get the help but it’s not always like that. He’ll see busting my ass sometimes and not do anything til I’m about to lose my mind
TwoXChromosomes,fenj7fk,t1_feguird,1579285847.0,Even when they do it’s because you have to tell them to
TwoXChromosomes,fenitzv,t1_feibnps,1579285621.0,"I have rich friends who are miserable and act like slaves to their husbands, house, and kids. It’s beyond my comprehension why they won’t just hire a housekeeper. It’s hard to stop and find one but damn make it easier on yourself! That’s the first thing I’m getting as soon as possible."
TwoXChromosomes,fenice0,t1_feijnur,1579285319.0,Exactly. It’s expected and thankless. But when they do show up once in a blue moon it’s like they’re some kinda hero. That mentality has got to go
TwoXChromosomes,fenhw58,t1_fehsg9y,1579285041.0,"It’s seriously so sad. Some don’t help around the house, help with the kids, bother to be a good husband who actually cares.... nothing. Then they have the fucking audacity to complain that we nag too much."
TwoXChromosomes,fenhkre,t1_feipjtc,1579284845.0,My husband is like this. I told him to check the light in his car as I was getting into mine. So he checked the light and went back inside without bothering to close the door. I had to get up out of my car to shut the door. It’s stuff like this that happens all the damn time. He’s just so clueless sometimes
TwoXChromosomes,fenh4i7,t1_fegvkev,1579284567.0,They want a cookie for doing the bare minimum
AskWomen,fenc2qq,t3_eq37d2,1579281484.0,No.
AreTheStraightsOK,fenal9n,t3_eo9ae2,1579280563.0,You don’t help because it makes your wife’s life easier and her happier. You don’t care about her at all. You just want to get laid
AreTheStraightsOK,fenaaed,t1_fed73t0,1579280377.0,Right? Like what makes these dudes so special?? The fact that they’ll never emotionally fulfill their wives? They think it’s cute to act like they don’t like their wife?
AreTheStraightsOK,fena1gg,t1_fegujke,1579280224.0,Yes. He believes it to be sexual. That his daughter will like his wife’s boobs so much it will turn her lesbian
AreTheStraightsOK,fen9wr5,t1_fedhy6m,1579280145.0,Fun fact- he made that shit up because he wanted to make it ok for the men molesting their daughters.
AreTheStraightsOK,fen9qp7,t3_eojozy,1579280041.0,Why are they like this?
AreTheStraightsOK,fen9lw2,t3_eop0cp,1579279958.0,So men are week because their girlfriends have the ability to purchase a meal? I can’t keep up with all of the things I’m not supposed to do in case it would upset some guy.
AreTheStraightsOK,fen8vhb,t3_epxel8,1579279514.0,Why do some men have to be like this? Like don’t make jokes that make it seem like you want nothing to do with your wife
AreTheStraightsOK,fen8iob,t3_epu044,1579279297.0,Why the hell would anyone date someone that they have to treat like a child. Or think being used equals maturity.
AreTheStraightsOK,fen8ce3,t1_femvbvv,1579279188.0,Right it’s an easy way out of a real genuine emotional connection and actually being a decent partner.
Boomerhumour,fen7pcs,t3_epyqmr,1579278788.0,I’m not a fan of men trying to be funny at their wives expense. It happens a lot. There’s a big difference in teasing about quirks and acting like you can’t wait to get rid of them
Showerthoughts,fen63f3,t1_fen39an,1579277792.0,Ahhh I see! Yeah I interpreted your comment wrong.
Showerthoughts,fen44rx,t1_fen24kz,1579276552.0,Oof. Glad you don’t have to deal with that anymore.
Showerthoughts,fen3z9t,t1_fen1t33,1579276456.0,Oh good! Yeah raising kids is pretty ridiculous sometimes. I never listened to my parents either
menwritingwomen,fen3vey,t1_fef3oyc,1579276389.0,Who needs a charming personality when you’ve got a great rack??
menwritingwomen,fen1hkf,t3_ep7fwg,1579274863.0,"As a mother, I too get super proud when my kid’s clothes fit well. Do they really think this is how we think????? “Way to go honey! Way to wear that dress!”. They honestly think we sit around thinking about what they think about our looks constantly."
menwritingwomen,fen1b2r,t1_femww88,1579274748.0,Why mention the buttoning. Obviously if you’re going to put a shirt on with buttons then you button it. It’s not something to sit around and ponder. Is that how men think?? “Time to take my button up shirt out. Now  I am buttoning up the shirt”  like wtf
menwritingwomen,fen11q9,t1_fejhit9,1579274580.0,You don’t think about that when you’re reaching for your blouse. Then also while you button it up. Then when you’re admiring your full lips? All I ever think about is whether I’ve still got it because my goodness... if my man isn’t happy with my looks then I don’t even deserve to live!
menwritingwomen,fen0l9k,t3_epiwit,1579274281.0,Why isn’t he more concerned about how creepy it would be to play tooless bad mitten at the age of 14. With her dad. Somebody fucking call cps and stop staring at her hooters
menwritingwomen,fen0bca,t3_epmjbr,1579274098.0,Oh but if your boobs are good enough then gravity isn’t a thing for them.
nottheonion,fen03rc,t3_epv3tv,1579273958.0,But 8 year old children aren’t the ones coming up with the porn idea. If he’s an 8 year old then he wouldn’t be sexualizing other children. Does he expect someone to actually buy this logic?
menwritingwomen,femzuvf,t1_femqir5,1579273792.0,Phew!! It’s a good thing she got his wiener approval! Who needs to worry about the two children you’re raising if you’re not sure if your thunder thighs are deemed acceptable by some dude.
menwritingwomen,femzom9,t1_femtf9k,1579273676.0,Right? I was pretty shy when I was younger and sensual is not how I would have described it. What this dude meant to say was that he will sexualize anything.
menwritingwomen,femzghn,t1_femigxn,1579273520.0,I just spat out my coffee
menwritingwomen,femzb1f,t1_femhetu,1579273414.0,Yep! All virgins are shy! Woman can’t possibly be extroverted unless a male has gifted them some d.
menwritingwomen,femz2f2,t3_epxm05,1579273251.0,Ah so you have to be shy to be sensual when in maiden hood. What the f is this guy talking about. The characteristics that men assign to women are mind boggling to me. They’ve like decided we all have to be a certain way and when we don’t meet their weird expectations they get all weird and bitchy about it.
Showerthoughts,femvt86,t1_feln9b0,1579270934.0,I mean is that what you do when you see your wife or kids? Act super thrilled to see them every time you’ve been apart? Cause if not then I don’t think that should set the bar for how much someone appreciates you. Plus you’d probably start to think they’d have lost their minds if that’s how they always greeted you.
Showerthoughts,femux06,t1_felvosj,1579270265.0,Well your dog doesn’t drive or have a car or anything else to deal with. I really hope my husband doesn’t ever see me like that. And that you do actually find things about her to appreciate. People have their weaknesses but I’d hate for him to resent me over something as silly as a car battery. Like if he preferred connecting with a dog over our family because we’re not perfect I would feel like absolute shit. My ex husband was like that and I was always walking on eggshells.
Showerthoughts,femtryf,t1_fekx8ds,1579269373.0,"My dad did that too. Except he just gave her away or dropped her off. He also did that to my moms, just got rid of her dog one day without telling her, when they were dating and she didn’t figure it out until he got rid of my childhood dog. Luckily she found her dog... she was obsessed with it. But yeah... totally psychotic. Such a screwed up thing to do."
Showerthoughts,femt9nv,t1_fellf34,1579268971.0,If I ever get a little dog again I’ll have someone else train it. I have adhd so I’m still trying to train myself to be an adult.
Showerthoughts,femswqw,t1_felh72y,1579268678.0,I don’t have one and I’m not gonna lie... it does make me happy. My last dog was so bad that I never want one ever again. She had doggy ocd which meant that she was freaking psychotic
Showerthoughts,femsic3,t1_feluqqj,1579268356.0,Really? I feel like this is by far a mom thing. At least for me and all the mom friends I know with the exception of like one. Good dads but yeah... they’re not exactly running the show
badwomensanatomy,feme1vg,t1_fem6zg6,1579250683.0,Not uncommon. Sadly.
badwomensanatomy,femdzf4,t1_fele923,1579250588.0,I wish they would just start fucking each other. I absolutely hate and can’t even comprehend that this is some people’s reality.
holdmycosmo,femdoin,t3_epmyud,1579250165.0,But mine just because you can doesn’t mean you should....
quityourbullshit,femd6v3,t1_felxusy,1579249482.0,These people commenting don’t own a business and don’t understand how frustrating it is to have some weird lonely psycho come in to try and mess with a significant part of your life.
quityourbullshit,femd2cp,t1_felkw3s,1579249310.0,"It does happen. I really believe some of it is spam or people are paid to review stuff. Like at this point you have to know you can’t always believe what you see... why be skeptical of a negative review when there’s almost always fake positive reviews. I get really annoyed when someone reviews my husband negatively when he has never even worked with the reviewer. Calling them out and saying hey, I met you but I never worked with you... or you’re not one of our clients and this just isn’t true... people get mad at their ex’s or ex friends and decide to slander them online. So why shouldn’t he call them out for their nonsense? That is his livelihood! He’s worked so hard for his career. And yes I’m sure some reviews are honest but there’s been 2-3 on my husband and they were all fake and probably coming from the same individual who has made up 2-3 fake internet names. Don’t be naive. People are crazy and would do this for whatever weird reason they tell themselves is excusable enough."
quityourbullshit,femcjir,t1_fem712d,1579248613.0,"Like I’ve definitely done that but I didn’t ever say I wanted that posted publicly. If I wanted to do that then I would. It was a mandatory answer you had to write in a survey for a discount or something. Its bs that they don’t tell you openly and obviously that your answers will then be turned into an online review that other people see. I wouldn’t bother with that without actual thought about something I was actually into. It’s rude that the person above said that people who do that are dense. I mean... yeah, we probably are dense. But it doesn’t make it any easier when they purposefully mislead you into thinking a posted review is just a quick feedback survey."
quityourbullshit,femc0ub,t1_fem4z9i,1579247934.0,"Omg this literally just clicked for me. Not only did I think that I was not leaving any amazon reviews ever, but I think I was and I think I was one of those kinds of reviewers.... dammit I thought I was giving company feedback and didn’t know why the questions were so stupid. They really need to label that better. I have been interneting since I was a kid and if I’m confused about this then there’s got to be more."
stopdrinking,fejc0nh,t3_epdwi6,1579166420.0,"If people hassle you about it, fake it. You can sit there and drink a club soda and nobody will know there’s no vodka in there. That’s what I did at first to get away from the pressure that comes with knowing you need to take it easy combined with your friends telling you you’re not being “cool”. Mmkay... were all annoying as hell when we’re drinking but I digress! A little distance and faking. Then when everyone else is also sober, you can explain to them that you’re done if they ask."
sarasota,fec1f1h,t1_febu1yq,1578965243.0,Thank you!!
insanepeoplefacebook,fe5t98y,t3_ed4mqd,1578874440.0,Why on earth would this dude believe this chick would be into him? At all? Ever. She would never be into him on any level. Ever. It’s actually pretty funny how some stupid man believes any woman would be into this conversation and why a girl who looks like that would want someone who looks like him. Whoever said the confidence thing really cracked me up.
insanepeoplefacebook,fe5sxwz,t1_fbfmxwv,1578874246.0,How? I can’t get my mom to stop thinking her fake boyfriend is real. Seems fine but it’s not... she’s rude to us and prefers her fake boyfriend
insaneparents,fe5sleg,t1_fe49ala,1578874032.0,My mom is like this too. My sister is going through a hell of a time and my mom is making her more miserable on purpose because she wants her to move out

BravoRealHousewives,fdypdgg,t1_fdyh6pp,1578782188.0,I respect that
Showerthoughts,fdxyyed,t1_fdxln4z,1578774305.0,The people in charge CAN see the Forrest through the trees and that’s why there’s war over it. They make way way way too much money and have too much power to ever let the transition happen.
BravoRealHousewives,fdxxyu3,t1_fdwtzfa,1578774051.0,Right? I don’t know why people are saying Texas isn’t like that when it is. And they literally think it’s so super special to be Texan and that it’s the best place on earth. I’m from there and it’s embarrassing. They’re intolerant and purposefully ignorant. Why on earth would anyone say that calling them out is ignorant? I have friends who just moved back and their kids are dealing with other kids at school making hateful jokes about Jewish people and all have severe homophobia. We’re talking about one of the worst states in America for education full people who feel so entitled that they make fun of anyone who’s not like them. It’s full of ignorance. Thank you for being honest. I left and never looked back.
BravoRealHousewives,fdxvwhk,t1_fdxckef,1578773443.0,Yeah that was the dumbest thing ever

sarasota,fdqticj,t1_fdqd022,1578674545.0,Lol I don’t know where those people get off. The reason why it’s difficult finding someone we can afford is because it’s hard!!! If they didn’t deserve to be paid then nobody would want them lol
sarasota,fdqte8j,t1_fdq9yoz,1578674476.0,Oh for sure not. If I were able to do that I’d definitely charge a lot for it lol. That’s a great idea!!! Thanks you so much!

todayilearned,fd3xh5x,t1_fd3cs0v,1578162467.0,It’s really terribly sad that he seems to agree with the basic acts of human kindness yet cant wrap his head around a man loving his baby and wanting to be involved with them enough to carry them around in a baby carrier... I’m confused as to why anyone would think that being a good father means you’re not a man

todayilearned,fd3wa8s,t1_fd3d9fw,1578162214.0,You’re right but what I don’t get is how he believes using logic equates to being a shitty father. Bond loves his baby and I think that’s sexy as hell
