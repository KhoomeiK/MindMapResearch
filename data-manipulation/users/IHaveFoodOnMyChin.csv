AskReddit,ffjj0ff,t1_ffiq2vz,1579999313.0,"Something in this same realm happened to my mom. One day she was parked at a store in our hometown. After shopping she got in her car and was about to leave. As she was backing up she heard a thud (this was before backup cameras were a thing). 

She immediately stopped and got out of the car to see what she had hit. When she got to the back of her car she saw an old women laying on the ground. 

At that exact moment a police officer pulled up with his lights on. The officer called an ambulance and the woman was taken to a  hospital. The lady fractured her hip during the fall and died that night in the hospital as a result of surgical complications. 

Although the situation sounds like my mom would have gotten effed, it was actually a good thing the cop was there and witnessed the whole thing. According to the police officer my mom didn’t actually hit the lady, the lady had stopped short of my moms car and extended her arms so that she was touching the vehicle. When the woman touched my moms car she pushed off the car which made her lose her balance which caused the fall.

The officer recounted the entire story to the higher up authorities and even recounted the events to the family of the lady. The event was caught on the officers dashcam and after seeing the incident the family decided not to pursue any legal actions. My mom obviously felt awful about the events. 

The family of the lady were very good people and asked my mom to attend her funeral bc they knew that ultimately it wasn’t my moms fault. Regardless of this my mom has always felt guilty over this woman’s death."

After a couple months of this I had enough and called it off bc we would fight any time I said something she didn’t agree with. Predictably she berated me and said I was no different than all the other “scumbag, mother fucking chauvinist pigs” our there and said I only viewed women as sex objects. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, yet I was being accused of something I definitely am not. She treated me like nothing more than a breathing dildo, yet she had the nerve to accuse me of objectifying women."
