I didn't felt that pain on my legs that much, it was like  if I was flying. Cannot explain it in words i think (and less with my limited english haha) but since then, I started to need it and now i think im addicted ;-) 

And i also think it helped me grow as a person. It helped me develop self-control and also teached me to enjoy little things.

Srry for my bad english"

Even the bible is pretty scientifically accurate if you understand that some things it says can't be taken literally (is has been translated from a couple of old, dead languages) and should be understood as a methaphore (like the word ""days"" is used several times to refer to a period of time, not a literal day, like creationists believe)"

But we had trains, and all the group of kids from the neighborhood met near the railway the saturdays at 11am to wave to the train. I still remember the joy when the train driver waved and honked the train (you can imagine the strong sound of a big train's honk) for us. And also some mondays at 1pm, the passenger train passed. And not only the driver honked us but some of the passengers returned the wave too. (Srry for my bad english btw)"
