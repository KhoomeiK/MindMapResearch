With micro dosing, if you feel it after taking it, then lower the dose. It's to ""rewire"" the brain subtly, rather than catching a buzz. Ymmv."

MechanicAdvice,feg3csb,t3_eotydn,1579075104.0,"I've had 3 1994 Rangers in the past 3 years. First two were 2.3l, have 8 spark plugs on a 4cyl. Pia to change, but only have to di it once with platinum plugs. 
Good trucks, not hard to work on nothing that squirrelly or special. 
Both 5 speed manuals. Maintain them and they are solid. Good truck. 
3rd was 94 V6 automatic transmission.
Terrible gas mileage, no noticeable power increase (I do landscaping, drag trailers, load with sand, gravel, brush).
Tranny will die, started slipping but not before the head gasket blew. I was apprehensive of an automatic going in but I needed a truck. 
First truck was B2300, which was a rebrand Ranger (I was not a fan of Fords either), became a believer, the auto Vulcan broke my trance. It only had 110k on it, the others had 160+.
Got a 2000 S10 now. 2.2l automatic.
Ford was overall mechanically better designed, (easier to work on). 
Chevy has goofy shit like coils on the bottom of the motor so plug wires have to be fed and routed around the block from plug to coil. Doors are welded on so changing door pins is tricky and they are prone to failure so doors sag and leaks when it rains. S10 is bigger bed, 2.2 is strong with 300k on it. Yikes.
I needed a truck. 
Tldr: I wouldn't buy a V6 Ford with auto trans, but Rangers 2.3 manual tranny are bullet proof imo and mechanic friendly (15 minutes to change alternator)  and the larger sized S10, is okay, in spite of some dumbass design flaws that explain why GM stays in trouble.  My 2 cents."
autorepair,fefxtuy,t3_eonipm,1579068808.0,"I had a head gasket leak as you describe, carried extra water with me, watched the temp gauge, never let it get into the red. It would run on the hot side always and try and overheat when ambient temperature hit the 90'sF.
Limped around like that all summer. 
Used Blue Devil head gasket seal, it gets good reviews, EXACTLY according to instructions, let it idle 50 minutes etc. 
It helped a little, it seemed, then completely crapped out. Overheated quickly and then no start. 
Used it again, with spark plug out, as that seemed to be where steam was coming from. Ran a little while then it( was done. 
V6 Ford
Tldr: Sell it while it's running, buy a beater with no major issues (any leaking head gasket is, or will become, a major issue). Drive beater without worrying about overheating and stranded. Ymmv."

If it's autodialer, block after it disconnects. If it's human, sometimes they identify why they're calling and it's actually important or someone you need to speak with calling from a different phone (mortgage, bank, insurance etc) and you can unmute and talk. For some reason, even important callers don't always leave voicemails."

I knew it wasn't normal but I didn't realize it was ADHD until lately when I went through a period of depression etc, along with the flu, and nothing worked at all. Physically wiped out and brain just crashed and burned from roughly Thanksgiving through Xmas.
