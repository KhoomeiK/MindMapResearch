personalfinance,ffrgdmi,t1_ffrfr05,1580157532.0,"I see what you mean, sorry for the confusion.

Basically, we have an $80-$100k down savings goal for our next house. We've got maybe $40k or so in a HYSA towards that goal. We're not in a particular rush for the new house (well I'm not, but my wife is a bit more anxious), but I'm still guessing we reach the savings goal in 4 years or less. We already have a home with a 4% mortgage so rent isn't a factor. I guess by my own logic though I should just throw more money at the existing mortgage since it's a higher rate. I think I've confused or over complicated the situation. Thanks for the input!

Edit for my own clarity: if I pay the car off now, in 3 years (since I have 36 more payments left), I will have recouped the amount I'd be shelling out now to pay the car off, plus saved 1.4% interest on the balance over that span. If I did the same for my current house, it wouldn't work out as nicely because I'll continue to have that same monthly mortgage payment in the short-term."
personalfinance,ffrdyoo,t1_ffrdm42,1580156122.0,"My wife and I max our 401ks and IRAs so can't go any higher in that regard. I would consider putting more in a taxable brokerage account, but since we feel comfortable with our current retirement investing, we've decided to save for a new home instead. I've read that if you intend on using the money in 5 years or less, it's not wise to put the money in the market, which is why we've opted for a HYSA for our house savings instead of equities. But paying off the car is a guaranteed 3% savings, which beats the 1.6% i'm getting with Ally at the moment and it has the added effect of eliminating a monthly payment."

But, unrelated to the life insurance, I do personally agree with his advice about the umbrella policy. My wife and I have a million dollar umbrella policy for our home/car that’s pretty cheap (maybe $250-$300/yr). Like if you caused an accident and someone died and the family sued you and won a half million dollar settlement, the umbrella has you covered.

tax,fehfwv5,t3_ep6ib7,1579115712.0,"I've read through your discussion in the link you provided, I think you're just having some trouble with the lingo is all. u/ROU_Misophist is saying you won't pay tax on gross income of $10k and he's absolutely correct. Gross income is BEFORE the standard or itemized deductions. So if your gross is $10k and your standard deduction is $12k, you end up with negative taxable income and therefore no tax.

I believe you're confusing gross and taxable income. Gross is pre-standard deduction and taxable is post-standard deduction. If someone's only source of income for th year is $12k or less and they file as a single filer, they will pay no tax because the standard deduction wipes that out. But if they make between $12k and $21,525 (for 2018), they'll pay 10% of whatever they make less $12k, the standard deduction. Hopefully this helps."
tax,fehett2,t3_ep6ib7,1579115077.0,"If you were a single individual in 2018 with $10k of gross income (note gross, not taxable), you would have $0 tax. The calc for this is the gross income less the single standard deduction of $12k results in negative taxable income.

Let's say you're a single individual with gross income of $20k. After the standard deduction, your taxable income would be $8k ($20-12). This $8k would be taxed at 10% for $800 of tax.

Only way for his total tax in 2018 to be $800 on $40k of gross income is if he also had credits such as the EITC or carryovers from prior years perhaps. It's impossible to say whether he's exaggerating or not without all the facts."

FinancialPlanning,fegnm39,t3_ep2l1j,1579098103.0,"Keep in mind sales tax is generally a tax you pass on to your customers. If you sell something for $100, the customer pays $106, then you pay MI $6 so you end up back at $100 net to you. 

Assuming you're going at this is a sole proprietor, you will have the SE tax of 15.3% as you mentioned and you'll be subject to tax at your marginal Federal and State rates. If you're in say the 22% Federal bracket prior to any income from your new business venture, you'll pay tax on ever dollar earned at 22% (until you've crossed the next bracket line) plus the 15.3% SE tax plus your marginal state rate. You could very easily pay 40ish% in taxes on every dollar of net income your business produces. But also keep in mind you pay tax on net income, not gross revenues.

JobProfiles,fefcazx,t1_feey03e,1579053206.0,"There’s some rigidity in accounting for sure, but there’s definitely plenty of room for creative problem solving. Client issues can often be approached in a number of different ways and you’ll find most CPAs do things that are slightly different from others. This is also what gives accountants a way of standing out and making a name for themselves. The partner I’m set to replace is as important to her clients as the air they breathe. They need her and rely heavily on her and this makes her invaluable. 

There seems to be a stigma about accountants and math, but in reality we use very little complicated math. Sure, we are doing math constantly, but if you can add, subtract, divide, and multiply, you have all the math skills you need. There is a lot of balancing of numbers in this profession so if you like when numbers work how they’re supposed to, you’ll like what we do.

Excel is the backbone of accounting imo. I work in excel files every day, nonstop. It’s one of the easiest and most efficient ways to present financial data so knowing how to use excel is critical. I wouldn’t say you need to go and take advanced excel classes or anything, but it certainly couldn’t hurt. You’ll learn a lot of tricks on the job from more experienced accountants. 

I’m not sure what the upper income limit is for non-CPA accountants in public. Generally, the CPA is requirement for manager and above at most firms because you need it to start signing off on financials. Given that you’re likely going to be stuck at senior and maybe cap at $80k or so. Lot of variables here though. If you’re ready to move past senior, you’re probably equipped to take and pass the CPA exams."

ravens,fdzvroo,t3_eng9v7,1578796962.0,"Feels like we gave them the 14 points they have with the interception and failed 4th down conversion, they aren’t looking particularly dominant on offense so we’re still in this"

gaming,fdserhh,t1_fds70k6,1578701043.0,"The point is in the past 7 years I haven’t had to upgrade my consoles. I like not worrying about whether my machine can run a game, I just know it can"

tax,fdrwwa6,t3_emx2an,1578690899.0,"When you and your sibling inherited the property, you received a step up in basis to the home's FMV at the time of your father's death. As long as 50% of the FMV on that date is greater than $25k, you would have no gain and would therefore owe no taxes on the $25k. Without delving deeper, it's *possible* you may have a recognizable loss, but I think the related party rules would kick in since the sale was between you and a sibling and there would ultimately be no taxable consequences of this."

As someone who doesn't have kids himself, I would never ever ever ever tell someone who doesn't want kids to have kids, but in your case I'm rooting for you to have kids who you can set on the same path you've taken and get the future generation off to a better start than you were given."

If you're not reporting the cash on your tax return, but you're looking for a way to prove income, you're SOL. As far as banks are concerned, if you're not reporting the income to the IRS, you don't have income."

I hated how your feet felt like they were cinderblocks, I hated having to get my guns off my horse, I hated the slow horseback ride to get anywhere, I hated how pointless the camp was, I hated so many of the immersive details that others loved, it made the game feel slow and boring to me. I get why people liked the game, I really do, it just wasn’t my cup of tea which was a shame given how much I’ve loved all of Rockstars other open world games, including the previous RDR."

patientgamers,fdqgs03,t1_fdqezxz,1578666281.0,"I’d rather it be like RDR1 or GTA, both games I absolutely loved and have a faster, less clunky gameplay. IMO, they got too bogged down with realism and immersion in RDR2 and that actually made the game less fun for me"
patientgamers,fdqchdp,t1_fdq9tmg,1578662942.0,"This is my core problem with open world games. If the game play gets stale/boring, I’m going to burn out from that and never see the rest of the game. 

I’m in a small minority of people who thought RDR2s gameplay was boring and clunky and I ended up not being able to finish it as a result, despite what might otherwise be a great game."
