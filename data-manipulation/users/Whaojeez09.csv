>No. Schiff said all evidence, AFTER Mcconnel changed that specific part, concerning evidence, in his resolution. 

No. He didn't. Again it wouldn't make sense considering he was playing videos which is considered evidence. 


>Actually no. In the Clinton trial, no new witnesses were called

Which is my point. Because there were none.


> All three witnesses were questioned by Ken Starr. Clinton invoked executive privilege, Starr went to court (unlike the democrats) and won. 

You still missed the point. He didnt deny ALL evidence in a blanket fuck you. Even so the ""questioning"" part of the trial happens before witnesses and new documents are produced. How the fuck does that make sense if I understand that correctly? Other than trying to bury further evidence. 

https://youtu.be/sXJO7K8stq4 

Yes I was right. Questioning comes first. Fucking looney and illogical

>>Notice how it wasnt a flat out denial of ALL things asked for through the course of the inquiry

>You're changing the goal posts. The democrats were outraged that Trump invoked executive privilege.

No they werent. You are lying or dont pay attention. They literally even said multiple times in their statements in those 12 hours they he has never really invoked executive privilege and that he only made an entire blanket refusal to cooperate claiming absolute immunity or something to that effect. This is proving you didnt actually listen. They said this multiple times.


>Clinton did the same. Nixon did the same. 

Yes, for certain executive privileges. Not just fucking everything.


>>Because he is a political hack

>Starr was appointed by an impartial 3 judge panel. 

That doesnt make him not a political hack since then. The very fact he thought we could impeach Clinton and not trump over all this is all the proof you need besides everything else. 



>Adam Schiff, for two years, claimed that he had evidence that shows Trump is a Russian agent.

Asset* 

We all have that evidence. I think you dont understand what agent means. He constantly lied about his contacts with Russia and the help he knew he was getting from them. Even encouraged it. That is literally making him a Russian asset especially when he tried many times to engage in policy beneficial solely to Russia like lifting the sanctions when he was elected.


>He still hasn't released his evidence.

It's all over google. Trump literally called for thier help on t.v. He stood on the world stage and sided with Putin instead of his allies. He encouraged thier help in his election. He sought to get rid of sanctions when inaugurated. Google dude lol. 



>The head house manger believes the democratically elected POTUS is a Russian asset. This is Alex Jones level of conspriacy.

No it isnt. It's literally the definition of asset. Please Google before commenting

>Imagine Obama was on trial, and Republicans decided to select a house member who propagated the conspiracy theory that Obama was a Kenyan. Not only did he propagate that theory, but he claims that he has evidence that Obama was born in Kenya.

This is because he was referring to the evidence they are currently blocking. Which is new witnesses and testimony. That wouldn't make any sense for him to claim literally all evidence considering he was showing videos and reading from transcripts for that 12 hours. I think you are confused about what they were talking about

Or you didnt pay attention

>Furthermore, the democrats kept on repeating that Republicans were not following the  Clinton precedent with regards to procedure.

Yes. New witnesses.

And questioning. 


> Democrats claimed the Republicans were completely ignoring the Clinton precedent.




>Don't take my word for it, take the Washington Post! (Note: this article was approximately written two weeks ago. But It's good reference to how the Clinton rules work).

>>**During the Clinton trial, the Senate unanimously passed a set of rules that allowed for votes to subpoena witnesses later on.** It was noncontroversial because there really wasn’t any reason for such negotiations to take place on the front end. If Republicans wanted Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal to testify, they could just vote to do it later

They ready had the depositions so you are comparing apples and oranges and you know it

>Another thing I heard repeatedly was that Bill Clinton voluntarily cooperated. That he, unlike Trump, did not invoke executive privilege. 

>According to wiki:
>
>>The Clinton administration invoked executive privilege on fourteen occasions. In 1998, President Bill Clinton became the first president since Nixon to assert executive privilege and lose in court, when a federal judge ruled that Clinton aides could be called to testify in the Lewinsky scandal

No. No one serious is claiming that. This is a straw man."
funny,fdrpu96,t1_fdrjqn8,1578687916.0,"And what part of that was not calmly done? Do you always rage out when you give criticism and that's why you assume they need to ""calm down""? Why do think making a comment calling out a word implies they were just so angry about it? You are making it up in your head. Based on that same logic from you, you also need to calm down for telling them to calm down"
funny,fdrjb9v,t1_fdr3tif,1578685261.0,Literally nothing about that comment suggested they werent calm
politics,fdrei30,t1_fdrax04,1578683404.0,"I love that when you get proved wrong, instead of admitting you didnt know what you were talking about you make some vague insult about media. Grow up kid"

That is not what the article claims it was for."
politics,fdreck6,t1_fdqyrjk,1578683314.0,">How would impeachment have played a role in anything?

Read the article kid. It literally states it was reported he said it was to gain favor with senators that have been wanting this so they will vote favorably for him during impeachment.

Read the article before you start bitching next time


> Nothing came of it

Actually he was impeached. And is still ongoing for removal (which probably wont happen)


 >and nothing will... these opinion articles are getting better and better

Not an opinion article. It's literally reporting a quote."
politics,fdre5eb,t1_fdrc9v0,1578683188.0,No it isn't. The man is a complete piece of human shit.
politics,fdre3us,t1_fdr0c1o,1578683161.0,This comment is so stupid. You are vastly oversimplifying the situation

AskReddit,fdq5zeb,t1_fdp0ej6,1578656358.0,Any excuse at all you wanna try first the example I just gave you ignored? Or you wanna admit he lies all the time?
AskReddit,fdp5voz,t1_fdp5cwa,1578620723.0,That did not address the comment
AskReddit,fdp5rsq,t1_fdp3ppi,1578620649.0,That wasnt the point of what they were saying. You are just gaslighting them
