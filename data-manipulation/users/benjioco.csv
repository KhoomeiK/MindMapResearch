college,fehec26,t3_ep1or8,1579114789.0,"I’ve found it easier to eat healthy at school rather than at home, which is surprising. My family tends to eat a lot of the same stuff, which is generally pizza or pasta, with the occasional chicken breast. At school there’s this one place that makes great salad bowls where I can add whatever protein I want, it’s fairly pricey (I have a declining balance meal plan) but we’ll worth it since the portion is fairly large. It’s all about knowing where to look and what to get!"
