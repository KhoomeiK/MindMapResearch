instantkarma,fc1w3qz,t1_fc16num,1577331525.0,"abuse entails brainwashing and gaslighting. many abuse victims didn't start out that way, were raised like that, or don't know any better. abuse victims sometimes believe that the abuser still loves them, and sometimes it's true-- that doesn't make it healthy. have you ever heard that idiom about boiling a frog? put it in boiling water and it'll hop out, but put it in water and slowly turn up the heat and you've got yourself a boiled frog. when the relationship began, he was probably a nice guy. however, the longer the relationship went on, the more he began to reveal his true self."
