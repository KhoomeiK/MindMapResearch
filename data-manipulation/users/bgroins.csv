politics,ffaof03,t1_ffankgc,1579740718.0,"My parents are lifelong Republicans and not garbage people. They're religious, wealthy, xenophobic boomers who watch Fox News exclusively so they see and hear almost nothing negative about Trump. They have their worldview constantly reinforced and twisted through fear and manipulation by Fox. My dad in particular is exceptionally intelligent, but paradoxically quite religious and is a sucker for hucksters like Trump (and numerous pastors). I hate Trump and the current GOP, but I don't hate his supporters for the same reason I don't hate say... Scientologists. What both groups do is objectively bad, but they're both brainwashed groups who fall prey to confirmation bias and fear of people who are different (or subversive). It's not out of evil intent."
