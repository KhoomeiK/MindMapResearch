socialanxiety,ff3ya32,t1_ff3q8rs,1579551489.0,"Maybe in the position you're at now people do think you behave weirdly while they are talking to you. But whatever they think isn't doing anywhere near as much damage to you as all the negative evaluations you give yourself. All this shame you're carrying and berating yourself for is the reason you can't look people in the eye, it's the reason why you think looking at their body makes you a pervert, and it's the reason why you assume everyone views you as negatively as you do yourself. Have you ever talked to a therapist or psychologist about any of this?"
socialanxiety,ff3k89f,t1_ff35fje,1579542817.0,"It doesn't look weird. Eye contact isn't about staring into someone's soul for an entire conversation, you should be just glancing to the side every few seconds or so and then returning to eye contact. Shift your gaze in gradual fashion, don't make darting movements with your eyes as that will make you look a bit nervous. When you've trained yourself to avoid eye contact it is difficult to change that but you have to take it one step at a time and focus on small improvements rather than beating yourself up by calling yourself perverted or weird whenever you struggle with it."
Anxiety,ff35yhv,t1_ff2x53t,1579534472.0,"In that case this was probably just another stage of their ""banter"", as cruel as it was. Sadly when you allow yourself to be vulnerable and share deep fears or insecurities some people just see it as something to mock. I know with social anxiety it's anything but easy, but I suggest you do whatever you can to find some new friends who are more supportive. It's so important to have people around you that you can be open with and feel safe doing so."
socialanxiety,ff33t7b,t1_ff2f3at,1579532964.0,"Yeah that doesn't seem like enough of a reason to sacrifice a relationship. I can't help but think there is more to his decision, maybe rather than working on his anxiety he is escaping the anxiety he is experiencing as part of your relationship. I imagine that a new baby has brought increased interaction with your family which could be a bit of a nightmare for someone with social anxiety. Either way it doesn't seem like he is someone you can rely on, you might be better off without him if it was so easy for him to just walk away."
Anxiety,ff29ni0,t3_er846d,1579497927.0,"Wow that is really horrible. I can't understand how a friend would find it funny to emotionally torment you like that, especially when they know about your mental health issues. Were they understanding and supportive when you talked to them about your issues before? If I were you I would just blank them and see what they do, hopefully they realise what they did was awful and apologise for being assholes."
socialskills,ff23jdc,t3_er79ei,1579492824.0,"I understand what your getting at but I'm not sure this applies to abuse victims as you say. Suffering that kind of treatment tends to make people more wary, apprehensive and distrustful towards others, haven't heard many say it was beneficial socially."
socialanxiety,ff20c05,t3_er3ozx,1579490423.0,"Has he said what he is doing now to deal with his anxiety that he couldn't do while being with you? Leaving behind your relationship and your baby just to ""get better"" seems like a huge cop-out, even for someone struggling with anxiety. Maybe caring for a new baby while dealing with his anxiety has been overwhelming but ending your relationship obviously doesn't absolve him of that responsibility and leaves him without his closest support in his personal struggles. He has let you down massively and it's hard for me to see how he can say he loves you after leaving you in the lurch like this."
socialanxiety,ff1to1y,t3_er4u5o,1579485935.0,"If you worry about a social situation because you fear you will look stupid, do something embarrassing or be judged negatively in some way then that is social anxiety. At it's core is this fear that for whatever reason you aren't good enough to be accepted.

Introversion is more about a preference for lower intensity, less socially stimulating experiences. Generally, introverts would rather socialise in smaller groups and enjoy solitary activities because they find these situations less draining, but not because they view themselves or their behavior in a negative light."
Avoidant,fe3aph6,t3_enowr0,1578847592.0,"I read another of Martin Kantor's books on AvPD recently and I have to agree with you. While I feel I did get some valuable insight, he seemed to have the opinion that Freud's work in this realm is undervalued and tended to give his interpretations with that kind of slant. For example much of his discussion around intimate relationships focused on the idea that avoidants find difficulty here because they see (consciously or subconsciously) their partner as a substitute for their mother, and hence avoid being intimate because of the incestual connotations.

I think he has personally done a lot of work with homosexual patients specifically. The book I read was littered with examples of such patients struggles, particularly with shame around their own sexuality. I guess this might have stained his view when it comes to bisexuality in AvPD sufferers."
socialanxiety,fe07a38,t1_fdzv0on,1578804927.0,"I think the problem is that exposure on it's own can set you back ever further if you don't have good ways of processing all the feelings that it will inevitably bring up when you struggle or fail in some way. To quieten and challenge the negative thoughts those experiences produce you generally need that outside support, which might not always be readily available when your younger."
socialanxiety,fdpr706,t1_fdpljqb,1578637397.0,"Exposure is a gradual process. You start with a whole lot of fear and very little desire or willpower to expose yourself to it. So you start small with the least worrisome situations that you might just be able to cope with. As you get comfortable with this level of exposure you chip away at a bit of that fear and hopefully increase your tolerance to it and your willpower to fight against it. You then push a little more into your fear, building more tolerance and willpower, and move up in difficulty again. And you keep repeating this process until your at a stage you're happy with. My point with this is that nobody has the willpower to consistently face their greatest fears at the beginning, so you start small and work at being consistent at the level of fear you can cope with. Exposure therapy in this view becomes a process of increasing your willpower to face greater and greater levels of fear.

So as I see it there is no paradox. You need exposure therapy to reduce your anxiety in easier situations, so that you can build up the willpower to consistently face the more difficult ones."
Anxiety,fdpl6fz,t3_emlk4x,1578631693.0,"It's not weird at all. You don't even necessarily need to have a diagnosable condition to benefit from therapy, the problems you're having are perfectly valid reasons to seek help."
socialanxiety,fdpiwva,t3_eml6lu,1578629849.0,"Your desire to avoid anxiety-inducing situations and the anxiety you experience in that situation are two different things. Having the willpower to overcome the avoidance does not mean that you don't experience anxiety in that situation, it just means that you have made a decision to accept the anxiety it gives you. But the goal of exposure therapy isn't just for you to be able to force yourself into being social with willpower, the goal is for you to feel comfortable and even find enjoyment in being social. That takes a lot of repeated exposure to prove to yourself that the anxiety you feel is not actually representitive of the danger of the situation."
AvPD,fdpbzu8,t3_emj9t6,1578624828.0,"You're probably still afraid of being judged in some way, it's just that you developed a desire to beat them to it as a defense. It's just another way of being avoidant. Rather than running away from them yourself, you make them run instead."
socialskills,fdn808r,t3_em8ef3,1578579768.0,"I wish I could say I share this experience but, if anything, the opposite has been true for me. I've only became increasingly insecure with age and isolated myself more and more as time went on because I couldn't cope with all the anxiety. For some people I think this is something you realy need to work on and get help with if your struggling, it doesn't always resolve or improve on it's own."
AvPD,fdlj8mx,t3_elxwz2,1578525230.0,Constantly. I think it's just a little way of escaping the awful life I've made for myself.
Anxiety,fdkii84,t3_elursx,1578504506.0,"I think you need to cut this guy out of your life. You tried to be upfront with him and tell him not to string you along romantically if you aren't exclusively together, but then you both went back on that request. Unless you get rid of him he's going to keep doing this because he is getting what he wants from this relationship. Him making fun of your dates also sounds a bit manipulative to me, like he is trying to convince you that he's better than anyone else you will meet."
socialskills,fdka5tc,t3_elu107,1578499533.0,"You probably should just stop trying, but I would try asking her why she always seems enthusiastic about hanging out but never actually does. Maybe there is some reason behind her flakiness, maybe not, but it can't hurt to ask at this point."
socialanxiety,fdj6iu6,t3_elm3p1,1578459833.0,"Joining a group workout class sounds like a good way of making friends. It's normally a bit easier to bond with people when you are participating in a shared activity. And I would say try not to think of it as going by yourself, you're going to join the group so you aren't going to be alone."
socialanxiety,fdj4rw9,t3_elnnqx,1578458430.0,What was the thought you proved to be accurate?
socialanxiety,fdful85,t1_fdfjbgu,1578370616.0,"Normally I'm told to ""just do it"" or ""it isn't that big of a deal"" and that honestly just makes me feel worse. Logically I know the thing I'm avoiding doing shouldn't be a huge problem, but anxiety doesn't really care much for logic."
socialanxiety,fdfgesz,t3_el3sgf,1578361095.0,"Yeah I'm dealing with some of this right now. Just can't bring myself to act until my back's against the wall. It's even worse if there is no real wall, then I tend to let things drift indefinitely. Not a good way to live."
Anxiety,fdfe3q4,t3_el3l9n,1578359545.0,"It's all the small steps that make up the giant leaps, keep making them and you'll be better before you know it."
socialanxiety,fde9s44,t3_ekwifn,1578334312.0,"I'm assuming you're not american considering you didn't just call it football, so wherever you are I'm sure you would be very welcome as it's still a growing sport. By the same token it's unlikely you'll be the only one there who isn't completely familiar with the sport or doesn't know what they're supposed to do, so as long as your eager to learn you'll be fine."
socialanxiety,fdcpuvi,t3_ekmcs0,1578281037.0,"It's never nice to have someone just stop you in your tracks like that, it's such a deflating and demotivating experience. Some people are just unable to cope with highly energetic or enthusiastic people but that is their problem, not yours. You should go back tomorrow and just be you, don't modify who you are for them."
socialanxiety,fdcnyi0,t3_ekmkpi,1578279638.0,"It might be helpful to write down everything you want to tell your doctor about your anxiety beforehand and take that note with you. Then if you get to your appointment and find it difficult to find the words you can just read from your note, or if the anxiety gets too much and you aren't able to say it you can just hand your doctor the note instead."
Anxiety,fc7bwv6,t1_fc6cn23,1577502958.0,"Yeah I'm the same. Even interactions that I believe went generally well will get stuck in my mind. I'll analyse everything I said over and over again, trying to find something I might have phrased in a weird way or something that could have been taken negatively without me realising at the time. And inevitably I'll find something when I drill down into every word like that."
Anxiety,fc5osy0,t3_egbma0,1577462826.0,"I developed this symptom as well during a period of illness which gave me a lot of anxiety. At first I just associated it with the illness, but even after that passed I was still experiencing this frequent need to pee and this was now what was causing my anxiety. I went to my doctor and they found nothing physically wrong with me so I tried to accept that I was causing my own symptoms by worrying about them. Over time I was able to lower my anxiety and gradually the problem went away. Maybe your problem is similar, but whether it's anxiety related or not I think it's a good idea to see your doctor about it."
Anxiety,fc4fvgt,t3_eg4dvv,1577415459.0,"It's possible if her parents suffered with it and she has grown up around that and struggled with it herself that all this behaviour has just been normalised in her mind. Have you ever talked to her about your own anxiety? If not, maybe opening up yourself might prompt her to share her own experiences."
Anxiety,fc4esxj,t3_eg4m0o,1577414586.0,"Ugh I hate when people do stuff like this in public, it's pretty much just deliberately embarrassing someone in an attempt to be funny. Maybe the intention isn't that sinister, but if you have some social anxiety that's going to be the result."
Anxiety,fc4canu,t3_eg26sn,1577412528.0,"It's totally understandable to sometimes worry about the death of someone close to you, especially a parent who cares for you so much. But if these worries are dominating your thoughts like you describe and preventing you from enjoying time spent away from your mom then I think you've absolutely done the right thing in seeing a psychologist. 

I'm sure your mom is so appreciative of the love you show her and everything you do for her, and what she probably wants most is just for you and your brother to be happy and comfortable. So please don't listen to that voice who tells you that nobody cares: it isn't true, you are loved each and every day. When you go to see your friends, try to remember that your mom is only going to be happy knowing that you're out having fun with them."
socialanxiety,fc0wv26,t3_efg39o,1577301823.0,"I've struggled with a similar mindset. Once my fear has established around people that I'm unable to socialise and unwilling to push myself into social experiences I can't help but feel it would be even weirder to just suddenly start attempting to interact. Not only that, I worry it would invite questions about the reason for this change in behaviour. I know that this faulty logic is the reason I'm in this mess in the first place but I just can't get past it."
socialanxiety,fbyzyj8,t3_ef6h05,1577230995.0,"I don't understand why positive judgement makes me every bit as anxious and uncomfortable as negative judgement, but it does."
socialanxiety,fbt13qw,t3_eecwz1,1577065519.0,"I think you are perfectly entitled to call them out over this. To invite you then just bail on you in favour of seeing the same movie with another friend is pretty awful. And then to just casually text you like nothing happened, it doesn't seem like this person had even a moment of thought for how you would feel in this situation."
