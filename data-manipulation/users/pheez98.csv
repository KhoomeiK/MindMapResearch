AskDocs,ffhktjj,t3_etmev8,1579939938.0,NAD - but i have had MRSA and numerous skin infections. google told me that lymphangitis is usually caused by strep or staph bacteria on the skin (i think these bacteria are normal on the skin and it causes problems when the skin is broken but i'm not sure about that). i actually took cephalexin a month ago for cellulitis. watch for more red streaking and a fever. keep the bite clean and put some neosporin on it. the antibiotic should get rid of it :)
AskDocs,ffhke6s,t1_ffh6o3q,1579939321.0,"hi! NAD. the talk about possible dermatitis made me want to jump in here really quick. i wore a ring for a few days on and off almost a year ago and still have an awful rash on my hand and am using a steroid cream for it. i know you said there is nothing visibly wrong, but maybe it could in fact be a reaction that just won't go away? like the one on my hand?"
NoStupidQuestions,ffhk66v,t1_ffhk0n6,1579939011.0,that makes sense...thank you!

politics,ff8fksj,t1_ff8fhz3,1579676316.0,mood. absolute mood.
AskDocs,ff2fymn,t3_er8lz9,1579504482.0,"NAD. do not panic but definitely get it investigated. i had random discharge at times and got it all checked out. everything was normal thankfully. for me, i never really got an explanation besides it just happens sometimes (could be a side effect of medicine, due to my obesity, the way i sleep, etc). moral of the story is don't panic but get it checked out"
AskDocs,ff2f1vq,t3_er99a1,1579503436.0,NAD - but someone who grew INTO a food allergy. it sounds like a minor allergic reaction to me based on what i've experienced.
AskDocs,ff2el2f,t3_er85du,1579502915.0,"NAD. definitely talk to your mom and please see a doctor! i don't know what could cause that but maybe it could be a food intolerance or something similar. only being able to eat certain things and skipping eating is bad for your health. good luck!

edit: re-read your post again. maybe a food intolerance would be worth looking into but since your hunger and stomach issues are affecting your routine and daily activities i think that's serious enough to warrant a doctor's visit."
AskDocs,feylitq,t1_fexuo0y,1579447202.0,cool. thank you. i need to call my doctor's office

AskDocs,fekhspx,t1_fekca2g,1579200327.0,"NAD but this. i used to find no harm in chiropractors until i came across a woman who is one. she's the mother of one of my sister's friends. anyways, she's a bit out there. and i'm being nice by saying that. she has put absolute nonsense into my sister's head about certain things and has tried to medicate my sister while she's at her house. i'm not saying all are bad but i trust professionals over these people. moral of the story - avoid."
