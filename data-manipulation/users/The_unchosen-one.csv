I was reading about it and the Pope even forbade the manuscript from being transcript at all during some time, and it was only allowed to be played at the Sistine Chapel during Easter festivities. The church thought this song was so beautiful that they did not want anyone else to have it."
interestingasfuck,ffixpyr,t1_ffixlq9,1579985283.0,"I don't now man, I said I don't know if it's true. Maybe the transcripts got lost, or damaged, I really don't know."
interestingasfuck,ffiwmun,t1_ffiwbhh,1579984498.0,"It's the church, full of rules and stuff that is not really logical. But I don't know if I'm understanding what you mean. The musicians were given transcripts, not shown the original manuscript to learn from. As I recall the manuscript was kept hidden in a safe, and only a few people had access to it, and those were the people who made the transcripts."

I don't if it's true though."

OP is saying that no one uses the right lane because it has not enough space due to the parked cars, but you can see that there is in fact space for a car to drive in it, as grey car did. Even if people do not use it often, it's still a lane, and if you're for some reason turning right from the left lane you should always check your mirror before."

If you don't have anything good or constructive to say about someone else's art then move on, it's not for you, let the people who like it enjoy it, like you probably do with the art you like."
Damnthatsinteresting,ferbdgx,t1_fer9uio,1579351995.0,"I don't see it like that. The things people are pointing out are thing they don't like, it is not bad art because of it.

AskReddit,feejy55,t1_feegbfr,1579035272.0,"Look, I have no intention in changing your mind, nor do I have an interest in discussing anything with someone who seems to prefer to profile me and then assume things I said have different meanings then they actually do, just because it makes them have a better standing point.

So take your ideas elsewhere. You have no idea what my position or relationship with guns is, and I have nothing to gain from keep going with this with you."
AskReddit,feedit8,t1_feeb64i,1579031523.0,"People use guns for more than to shot people, like shooting it to the air or at animals (and here I mean with no legal hunting purposes). All this is normalization of the presence of guns, almost as a tool that thay can use. This is what I mean, people that think is ok to carry a gun around and shoot it if they wish, not necessarily to kill or harm anyone.

Maybe you're right about the generalization. I'm not American, but the fact is that America is the country that is more often in the news everywhere about gun violence among civilians. And there are pretty big numbers that prove that violence is real, not just the networks pushing an agenda. 

When Trump said that he was referring to the Mexicans, a whole country's population. Here we're talking about a group of people that made a choice to own a gun. There's not even a comparison to be made here."
AskReddit,fee5yst,t1_fee34bi,1579027089.0,"Look, I don't hate guns. And I did not back peddled on anything. You say that because you're having trouble with processing ideas that are different from yours.

Let's try it one last time.

All gun nuts are gun owners, but not all gun owners are gun nuts. Can you understand it now?"
AskReddit,fee0yia,t1_fee0bx0,1579024108.0,"You've been assuming things this all time, that's just one more. Whatever makes you happy."

AskReddit,fedxxad,t1_fedxpg3,1579022226.0,"No, of course not. People can have guns and not be a nut job, right? Not every gun owner is crazy, but in America, there's a lot of them that are.

I'm not confused about anything. But you seem to be having a hard time understanding.

So you have the total of gun owners (whatever number that is), and I say a big part of those people are gun nuts. 

So, not everyone that owns a gun is a fanatic. Did you get it now?"
AskReddit,fedwpt5,t1_fednt5c,1579021496.0,"See, I did not say 'gun owners' exactly for that reason, yet you somehow only see what you want to see. I did not back peddled from anything, and I stand by what I said.

It is not as much of a caricature as you wish it was, otherwise the subject of gun laws and shootings in public places would not come up as often as it does in America."
AskReddit,feduxak,t1_fedoufc,1579020425.0,Did I say gun owner or gun nuts? You're getting to your conclusions on your own. Maybe read the tread before getting all triggered.
AskReddit,fedfgh4,t1_fedf82i,1579010075.0,"Sure, I did not say gun nuts as all people with guns. I mean those people that think having a gun and being able to shot it as they wish is their God given right."
