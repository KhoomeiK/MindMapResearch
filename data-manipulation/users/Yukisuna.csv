TallGirls,fdl0m9m,t1_fdk61uv,1578514949.0,"That IS strange, especially for near-adults... On the bright side i don’t think you’d WANT to go out with the type of person that judges you on your appearance anyway. Prejudices are ugly, and men that refuse to date taller women are often avoiding them only because they are deeply mysogynistic and believe being shorter than your partner is “feminine”, and as such would lose value if they are the “woman” in the relationship. I hate to point out a pattern with yoir boyfriends but if they ALL cheat on you you may want to make sure you’re truly exclusive to him before you get too attached. And not to go out with little more than a child that forgets you exist if he loses sight of you for a second.

I know this is the most boring phrase ever and you’ve probably heard it a million times for a dozen different reasons, but it gets better as people grow up. By the time you’re in your 20ies most people stop caring about “trendy” - they just want someone they get along with that they can be together with and feel happy, the “hollywood standards” tend to be a lot less important as people finish school and encounter loneliness for the first time from no longer regularly meeting a crowd of people around their age. Right now everyone’s at their most hormonal, unpredictable stage in life and it shows.

And speaking of hollywood standards, it’s NOT normal to find the perfect partner for you in your teens. Most people have NO idea what they want for their future - how would they know what kind of partner they prefer? And that one or two people judges your height negatively does not mean they all will, either. Even if it is a “trend” right now, nobody’s even going to remember it by the end of the semester as everybody’s still growing like crazy.

It’s hard to move on from a crush but if he or she is so prejudiced they think less of you for the way your body grew (completely out of your control, at that - unlike things like weight gain or muscle development, height is basically pre-determined before you’re born), are they really someone you would like to spend months and maybe years together with? Is that the kind of attitude you want to hear every week?

Considering the AVERAGE height in your area is determined by the middle point between the shortest women and the tallest women, that would be a LOT of tall women that nobody ever went out with. But that’s not the case, is it?

Finally, this crowd is not all there is. These are the only people you know and associate with right now, but do you enjoy that? Does hearing their collective height bias make you happier? Because they’re not your only choice out there. there will be a LOT more people in your life in the future, and you can always meet others from outside your class and year. Maybe you need to consider looking for partners somewhere else - perhaps someone a little bit more mature than 16-year olds that live their life completely dominated by whatever the recent trend tells them?"
