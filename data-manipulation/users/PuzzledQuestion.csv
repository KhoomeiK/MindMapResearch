Life just seems colorless and when I go on social media I see my friends going abroad to study/travel, partying and enjoying life in general. Meanwhile I don't feel like doing anything or meeting anyone due to depression and social anxiety. When I try to get out more it's like I'm forcing myself and I end up not having fun at all. When I was younger I thought life after reaching 20 would be a blast :("
college,ff2qlu4,t3_er72ir,1579519581.0,Yes. I think I became more depressed in college and I tend to avoid socialization when I can. The main reason triggering my depressive thoughts is that I am afraid of the future and that I am not spending my college life at its fullest potential because of my social anxiety etc. :(
college,fexs7k1,t3_eqpk6u,1579435317.0,"Most of my professors use PowerPoint slides, so during the lecture I open office word on my laptop and type down the information from the lecture. When I come home, I print out the slides and copy the notes from my laptop onto the printed slides. This method works for me mainly because when I copy the notes, it makes me reflect on the info from the lecture and that I get to write it down twice so my brain can absorb it better."
