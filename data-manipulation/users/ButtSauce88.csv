trashy,ffvtwvr,t1_ffvt0qb,1580273141.0,"It can take as much as 45 days to become clean for weed where alcohol is max 3 days if your an everyday drinker . I barely smoke now so I can pass a test in 3 days I just don’t think it’s fair because I don’t even think employers do an etg test, so alcoholics have no problem getting a job where as someone who smokes every night before bed will fail the test. I get why employers view it as a safety issue but it’s not an accurate test to show recent / frequency of use.  I’m pretty sure some states have recently passed laws saying employers can’t bar people from employment if they have thc in their system."
