TheOutsider,ffoyj7b,t1_ffott25,1580083320.0,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  A very strange movie (based on Hunter S. Thompson's book) that has a well deserved cult following.  With Johnny Depp starring, and a small part from Gary Busey in [the clip the above quote is from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwDlobymMk0).  Back before Depp and Busey turned weird.  

[And one from the opening, with Tobey Maguire and Benicio del Toro]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2pgWsYSyUA) (del Toro co-stars, with Depp).

And a non comedic, kind of [fascinating read/montage of one of Hunter S. Thompson's better known quotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUgs2O7Okqc&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqo4Uw_sfNDznz7si4O1VqLL&index=7) from the book (his ""high-water mark"" description of the peak and decline of the hippie movement's claim on american culture).

If you like that last clip, the top comment underneath it is also great:
>The thing Hunter got, I think, that a lot of people don't about that time and place, is that the Hippie Experience was unique even at the time. 

>There was no ""Hippie Generation,"" but a group of people who came to a certain place, i.e. the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco as well as the Bay Area as a whole, as well as other places like the Village in NYC, Woodstock, Berkeley, etc.

>The Beatles, Hendrix, and Dylan really were the biggest musicians of the era, but that didn't mean the people, even the teenagers and young people, all lived the Hippie lifestyle and protested the war Hunter experienced. So it doesn't really make sense to pretend that all these Baby Boomers (which by the way Hunter absolutely wasn't - he was born in 1937, which makes his recollections of the era so fascinating) grew out their hair, smoked weed and dropped acid, then suddenly ten years later voted for Reagan and became corporate slaves before retiring to Florida. 

>That's probably why Hunter felt so despairing about the era - it was an outlier even of its time."
TheOutsider,ffot9qu,t1_ffoplia,1580081480.0,"Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. A normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side. This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop heart. Make the bastard chase you. He will follow. But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you are about to turn right. This is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk. It will take him a moment to realize that he's about to make a 180 degree turn at speed, but you will be ready for it. Brace for the g's, and fast heel-toe work."

After you've had it happen, you know how disabling it is, but the first time, he's supposed to know this isn't the kind of pain he'd get ridiculed for reporting?  ""I imagine you wouldn't want someone watching your back who leaves their post and goes to a medic because they have a little blister"", as some jackhole further up described OP's pic.  ""A little blister"".  This is exactly the kind of thing people reasonably think they're supposed to suck up, the first time they're in the middle of acquiring the injury."
