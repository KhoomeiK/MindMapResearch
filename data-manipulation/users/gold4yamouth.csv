I think that there was a survey recently that to afford a minimal one bedroom apartment in Ohio you need to make at least $15 per hr full time."

dayton,fesppw8,t1_ferx9vt,1579367718.0,"Well, think about it in terms of the story. Area 51 didn't exist.

During WWII, the government uses Wright-Patterson as their base for reverse engineering any enemy technology they get their hands on, German, Japanese, Russian, etc. (even though Russians weren't technically enemies yet)

Then a few years after the war ends, the unprecedented happens: two flying saucers crash in New Mexico and are mostly intact. So the government has no facilities designed for such a thing because before the crash it wasn't known it was needed. So they logically load everything up on trucks and take it to their base where they reverse engineer technology (Wright Patt). It's probably safe to assume at some point in the 1950s they started building Area 51 so they had a place to test flying saucers once they figured out how to get them flying.

This is all fun speculation of course, I have zero proof and it's basically an alien conspiracy theory.

But keep in mind Wright Patt was also the place Project Blue Book operated out of, which was the Air Force's official program for debunking and explaining away UFO sightings..."

dayton,feke50n,t1_fekbnw5,1579198153.0,I think both of your theories have some validity. WSU's Film School has produced some pretty successful graduates for example and it makes sense some of them might want to throw a nod to Dayton.

Cops are investigating if it was a mechanical malfunction. Maybe the driver was having a heart attack.

I guess if the driver was doing that speed intentionally the situation is even more tragic, because it may have been completely preventable.

Hopefully the other four kids survive. So sad."
