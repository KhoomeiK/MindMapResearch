worldnews,ffetsvr,t1_ffemr6t,1579865193.0,Succession is the best HBO show I've seen since GoT. I know you can't compare a historical miniseries to Succession. Very different formats. But it's nice being able to look forward to a new season of a stellar HBO show again.
mildlyinteresting,ffesitj,t1_ffeayio,1579863439.0,"Go to a farmers market or ethnic grocery store. Not the farmers market in the neighbourhood with whole foods, but the farmers market where working class people live. Spend ten dollars you'll have more fruit and veg than you can eat. 

Some people complain that they aren't as sparkling clean or they see a fruit fly. Just rinse it off before you bring it inside. Best fruit and veg I've had has been pulled out of the ground and given a quick rinse. Here in Ireland the good potatoes are the ones with some dirt on em. Dirts got all kinds of healthy bacteria. Not saying go eat dirt and get worms, but sterilising food isn't good either.

This next part is only tangentially related:

A microbiologist studying why pigs rolled around in mud took samples of the mud and isolated bacteria that killed pathogens as stubborn as MRSA. They then used it to develop medicines and cosmetics. They also did an experiment where none of the scientists showered for weeks. They said at first they got the expected results: odor, greasy hair and skin, etc. Then after a while they claimed their hair and skin was healthier than ever. Even showering every day is excessive if we're talking about your human microbiome. A lot of beneficial skin bacteria are water resistant but not soap resistant.

I used to need to wash my face with soap every day and shampoo my hair every day. I scaled back. Now my face and hair only get excessively greasy after I use shampoo or soap. I still use shampoo and soap obviously but much less frequently and I get compliments on my skin and hair which used to be awful. Your skin and hair try to reach equilibrium so if you dry the shit out of it with shampoo or soap, make sure to rehydrate it with oil. I use coconut oil and no longer get dry frizzy hair or greasy face after soap. And if your hair and face aren't that greasy, simply washing with cold water and wiping away with a clean cloth will prevent that rebound effect. Unless you've got an infection or skin condition or some other factor, you're probably just seeing your skin respond to the fact that you're destroying all its defenses until its squeaky clean and dry as fuck."

todayilearned,ff5u8my,t1_ff5sp4d,1579610431.0,I used to need 12 hours of sleep a day and preferred 16. My symptoms were physical and all started around the same time but nope must be mental.
todayilearned,ff5u3g7,t1_ff5r6ws,1579610284.0,"This happened to me in America. Doctors blamed all physical symptoms on depression and anxiety. Then they found autoimmune markers. One diagnosis of lupus but I have multiple doctor who disagree over the diagnosis and they did a case study on me. First time a doctor actually gathered so much info and listened so long, because it was for his career. I was given no advice on what to do. When I asked they said ""idk find a research hospital with specialists? Maybe rare forms of cystic fibrosis.

By my late 20s I decided fuck it im just going to manage my symptoms as they pop up and probably never know what's wrong"

nottheonion,ff5svie,t1_ff503l9,1579608971.0,"Based on my personal experience if you're severely impoverished, disabled, unemployed, or even just have kids to take care of, Ireland will throw you a lot of money to get you on your feet and still keeps the incentive to work. From my research Ireland gives more money than anywhere in the world in welfare, and some adjustments and tweaks to the system are helping reduce the number of people taking advantage of it illegitimately. You're guaranteed a house, education, health care, PhD level education, the works. Yet there's still incentive to work while receiving disability and assistance in returning to the work force without sacrificing your benefits.

By the way the genetic link to IQ is tenuous we can't predict iq better than a coin toss knowing both parents.

Not to discount the Harvard MKULTRA studies meant to win his trust then tear him to psychological shreds, done for research on breaking down the enemy psyche. The one professor he trusted did it to him without his knowledge. Best case scenario they got unlucky and happened to choose a broken vulnerable individual. Worst case they precipitated it."

The DDT5000 did not absolutely correctly identify DUID offenders due to fairly large proportions of false-positive or false-negative results compared to drug concentrations in blood. The police reported that DDT5000 was still a valuable tool in identifying possible DUID offenders, resulting in more than doubling the number of apprehended DUID offenders."

I had just turned 18 that day so was tried as an adult. I took every scrap and crumb off my friend as we saw the cruisers box us in. I wanted to get him outta this. They charged him with the resin in the glass bowl which they claimed he was holding when they rolled up.

Tbh there was a HUGE bowl within the bowl that was filled with resin from years of use. That bowl itself could keep you high through your next re-up.

By the way my friends punishment being 17: Write a one page essay on dangers of marijuana. Serious.
My punishment? Got wrapped up with some other small charges like pending xanax posession etc. Then more serious charges. Then jail. For months and months just to start the trial."

As far as using a real name, that's where you fucked up. Plenty of NL vendors ship to US all the time but a fake name that doesn't pop up at that adress PLUS Netherlands to US = huge red flag. Always use real name. Know if you're supposed to sign too."

If was better living in the suburbs and going into the city to party then leave.

Oh and if you don't have money and move to the wrong neighbourhood its as dangerous as any city. When they cleaned up the city they just forced all the crime into one area away from the site of tourists and white people."
EarthPorn,fcmub60,t1_fcgzju5,1577792622.0,I guess I like it because I prefer mild temperatures and a bit of rain over extreme heat and snowy freezing blizzards. I hate the extremes of new York. Irish rain doesn't bother me much.
Crainn,fbfebgk,t1_fbdhj0l,1576808500.0,"Can't say for sure because I dono exactly how qr codes work and if the verification system can tell if the same qr code has been scanned a million times. If not, somebody could just take a picture of a legit qr code no? Don't they just work by matching the pattern? 

I've had really good Chinese clones of other products that included the scratch off verification code. It actually had the metal you scratch off like a lotto sticker but nothing underneath haha. They were counting on most people not going through the trouble and being satisfied with the sticker.

I mean let's be honest you're super high after getting some cali are you gonna go through the whole process of verifying it and checking for tiny minute differences in packaging or just see an official looking sticker or qr code and be satisfied?"
