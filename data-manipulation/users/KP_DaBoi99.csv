I'm almost done with college, but I live at home and commute every day. They still control me."
teenagers,ffj8v4w,t1_ffiw68e,1579993201.0,"Yeah, I didn't realize that until recently.

It's so hard to justify that your own parents are a negative influence on you. However, when they make you go through enough negative stuff, you can't keep making excuses for their behavior."
teenagers,ffibazg,t1_ffhr3sm,1579969782.0,"I was in math team in 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. I had a solid reputation. In 10th grade, I was one of the top 3 people out of the 60-80 people in the club. I was supposed to lead my team to victory at a state competition.

But I wasn't there. I didn't get to go because my parents had forced me to quit a month before the competition. Years of academy training wasted. Literally.

Their reason for kicking me out? I got a B+ in a math class. According to them, I didn't deserve to be in the club anymore.

Idk why parents become so horrible while their kids are in high school. I hope somebody is researching this and comes up with a definitive explaination of the parents' logic."
memes,ffgwyk8,t1_ffglr5i,1579917179.0,"I don't know if you're right, but I know that I was probably wrong lol. Thanos's sword didn't appear in Infinity War, so Thor couldn't have known about it when he was at the Forge. Maybe Eitri knew about it, but I doubt it.

You're probably right."
college,ffgwfvh,t3_etfpv7,1579916797.0,"As a Freshman, you should've paid close attention to the syllabus for each of your classes. They'll usually tell you how many days you can miss or how many days you can be late before you automatically fail the class.

The damage is done. You can't change what happened. However, if you get a high GPA this semester (at least a 3.9) and prove that you're a serious student, they might let you stay in college.

I want you to succeed, but know that getting a 4.0 is not easy. Getting a 3.9 isn't easy either. You can't afford to skip any classes anymore. If you're serious about staying in college, you won't skip a minute of class.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXT SEMESTER:
Finish homework as soon as it's assigned. Pay attention in every class. Study for tests early, not just the night before the test. Talk with your teachers if you ever need help or don't understand something. Your teachers want you to succeed as much as you do. Make new friends in your classes and help each other with homework, but don't make it obvious that you worked together. Most importantly, GO TO EVERY CLASS."
AskReddit,ffgqiz7,t1_ffgia5r,1579912502.0,"Your life sounds like mine. Except my family is full of great programmers who work almost 24/7 (myself included). Also, my family is abusive and I hate them. I'm waiting for my dad to die so that I can finally have some freedom and peace.

I also have an extreme fear of failure. If I don't get away from my dad, my life is over. For me, failure leads to suicide. But if I succeed, I get my freedom and my human rights."
college,ffgi953,t3_etf8rn,1579906839.0,"I'm a junior and I feel like I'm never going to reach the end of college. As soon as I finish one tough class, three tougher classes are there to make me feel worthless and stupid.

My parents never let me have a break. I spend my days studying, sleeping, or eating. I don't get to relax and play video games. I don't get to hang out with my friends outside of my college classes. If I get an A- in a class, they punish me even more.

These days, I spend 6 hours a day in bed, but I'm running on only 1-2 hours of sleep a day. My parents make me so stressed out that I can't sleep when I need to sleep.

College could've been a positive experience for me, but my family has made it horrible and painful. Hopefully, my parents will let me have some freedom and relaxation when I'm a full-time worker..."
AskReddit,ffggwi7,t1_ffgffts,1579905966.0,"I agree that family may not be easy to talk to. My family always gets angry at me whenever I'm being serious and honest with them. They always yell, but they never try to understand my perspective.

Recently, I told my dad about the times when I got beaten up in high school (5-6 years ago). My dad became extremely angry at me for not telling him earlier. He threatened to kick me out of the house unless I told him every detail of my entire life. I refused. Then, he told me that privacy is a privilege, not a right, and that he would punish me until he forced the information out of me. Fortunately, he forgot about it all a few days later.

I can't even imagine how bad his reaction would be if he found out I've been depressed and suicidal for over half my life...I would rather keep it to myself and have some peace than let my dad make my pain even worse."
memes,fffdafc,t1_fff26to,1579881433.0,"Do you mean the moment where Thor says that it's a suicide mission to fight Thanos without the axe? At that time, he didn't have his hammer, so he didn't have a powerful weapon.

Maybe Thor said this line to hint that Thanos's sword was made at the Forge and that Thor didn't have a chance of beating him without getting himself a weapon from the Forge.

I don't think there was anything explicitly said about Thanos's sword. It is possible that Eitri mentioned the sword while he talked about losing his hands, but I don't think he explicitly mentioned it or said anything about it."
teenagers,ffdyog4,t3_et0g04,1579832218.0,"I failed 3 out of 5 essays in my sophomore English class, but I still got a B in that class. In AP Biology, I got 3 F's, 4 D's, and 1 A on the 8 tests, but I still got a B in that class. I had one of the lowest grades in my AP Biology class, but I still passed the AP exam (I barely passed lol).

I went through similar experiences in several of my other classes. I had A LOT of bad grades in high school, but I still got accepted by the university I wanted to go to. Now, I'm a third-year college student with a high GPA.

Look at the big picture. You take hundreds of tests during high school. Failing one test has a very small effect on your GPA. Getting a B- on one test has zero effect on your GPA.

As long as you get at least a B-, ignore your parents' criticism and be proud of yourself. High school isn't easy to get through. Don't be too harsh on yourself when you're getting decent grades because you'll end up hurting yourself a lot if you get a really bad grade in the future."
Twitch,ffdn998,t3_estir6,1579824495.0,"If you don't have a social media account already, you should create one. Having a place where you can spontaneously announce when you're about to start streaming is good for both you and your fans.

Apart from that, you're fine."
Twitch,ff950oo,t1_ff934j9,1579704994.0,"I'm 20. After I finish college next year, I plan on having a full-time job and streaming part-time for a few years. After that, I'll decide if I want to keep going or if I want to quit.

Earning money from streams isn't a huge concern for me. My job should easily be able to pay for everything I need, but I agree about taking it slow."
Twitch,ff8aflw,t1_ff88zo9,1579670855.0,"Thanks for responding

I agree that too many people are doing the same thing. Consequently, I plan on creating some original (or at least uncommon) content for my audience.

Honestly, I'm extremely relieved that you said Twitch is currently like 2009 YouTube. That gives me a lot of hope. I was afraid that Twitch has already reached its peak popularity."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff6iivr,t1_ff6dv5b,1579627935.0,"On my first day of driving a car, my dad took me to the nearest police station's parking lot. It was full of police cars. He constantly yelled at me because I was scared of going over 5 mph lol."
