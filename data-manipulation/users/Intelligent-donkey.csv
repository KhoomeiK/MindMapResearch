Unlike Viren though, Callum would be able to survive the purification process, probably without it having much of an effect on him.  

But I'm not even entirely sure if the test would reveal that he's used dark magic, he has used dark magic but unlike with Viren I wouldn't say that this represents his ""true nature"", so if it's really a test of heart and not just a test of whether you've used dark magic, then he might pass it completely."

Peace and cooperation is generally far more fruitful than a cycle of violence.  

If there is a competition then of course it's preferable to be on the winning side, but it's even better when you're not directly competing at all, that's also an option.  

At no point do they say that humans were starving ""because of elves"", that they were in a direct competition with each other where they fought for land and resources and where one side had to lose.  

That's certainly not the case in the present, their borders have been clearly established and have remained unchanged for the past thousand years, so they're currently not really competing for anything.  

They have adapted to the amount of land they have access to, presumably their population size is appropriate for the amount of food and resources that their land can provide for. (With a successful harvest.) 

So the only thing that they might lack is certain resources that are only in Xadia, and vise versa.  
Exchanging those resources through trade rather than war would be far more efficient."

SandersForPresident,ffiefvt,t1_ffido49,1579971908.0,"Well, people aren't going to take puberty blockers until they're about to enter puberty, so it's not really going to happen when they're under 10 anyway.  


When they've already entered puberty, which is generally the case by the time that they become teens, then it's too late, so they WILL be quite young when taking puberty blockers, that's the whole point of puberty blockers, to not enter puberty.  

I don't feel like looking up exactly what Rogan said right now, but as I recall it he opposed it with the argument that children aren't fully developed yet and therefore shouldn't make those kinds of decisions yet, that's an argument that certainly does apply to children who want to take puberty blockers before they enter puberty.

Personally though I think that that's a bit overly harsh, even though I personally do think that children should be able to take puberty blockers and transition when they really want to, although obviously there ought to be a process to ensure that it's not done on a whim.  

But I understand why some people are very skeptical of that idea and why they would draw the line there, and don't think that it automatically makes them super bigoted transphobes who should be completely shut out of any type of political discourse."
politics,ffgs81z,t1_ffgqieu,1579913725.0,">Now imagine instead, there is a tax where every person in the city pays a few dollars, and as a result, the homelessness problem goes away. From your perspective, you spend a few dollars to make society drastically better, which is a great deal. That's the solution- taxes, government programs, not charity.

I agree with all that.  

Which is exactly why I'm fed up with how all these rich people keep touting their philanthropy and their private charities instead of calling for a wealth tax...  

They don't want the government to step in with additional taxes, all their philanthropy is just their PR budget that they use to avoid the government stepping in and actually enacting some meaningful changes and some real wealth redistribution.  

Take Bill Gates for example, all he ever talks about is his philantropy, yet at the end of the day his net-worth has continued to grow and grow and he goes on TV to oppose a wealth tax."

He talks about returning to the past way of doing things ALL THE TIME, he never shuts up about bipartisanship and working with Republicans, as if what democrats need right now is MORE compromising with Republicans...  

Biden doesn't want change, if you think differently then either you haven't been paying attention, or you're delusional.  

Yes, technically in the rest of the quote he implies that he wants higher taxes on the rich, but he doesn't go into specifics and keeps it all very vague.  
He's afraid to even use the word ""taxes"", all he dares to do is make a vague insinuation, yet what he's not afraid of saying is a promise that nothing will fundamentally change...  

That tells me all I need to know, Biden may incrementally increase income tax or something, but he's not going to do any actual wealth redistribution.  

In the end the fact of the matter is that Biden is talking to wealthy people at fundraisers, trying to pander to them and reassure them that he's on their side, so that they'll give him money.  

People are sick of politicians who are on the side of the wealthy, they want politicians to be on their side, and no matter how much Biden tries to pretend otherwise, rich people and regular people are NOT on the same side right now, it's ridiculous to try to address wealth inequality while pretending like workers and billionaires are on the same side and like you can satisfy them both."

TheDragonPrince,ffglg4s,t1_ffgk8op,1579908965.0,"Claudia keeps talking about what she can do with specific bodyparts, like how the eye of a griffin is used for a spell that ensures that an arrow will hit its target.  
(Which implies that there's a connection between the function of an organ, and the type of spell that you use it for, since eyes are obviously sort of related to aiming and accuracy and whatever.)  

It doesn't seem to be the case that there's merely a different power level for each bodypart, they all fulfill a different purpose when it comes to dark magic, the part you use doesn't just affect the power of the spell but also the kind of spell.  

So I don't think that collecting a bunch of skin cells for example, would enable you to perform the same spell that would otherwise require a creature's heart or whatever, those are 2 totally different ingredients that would be used for totally different spells."

What do you consider a ""fully fledged relationship""? Because as far as I can tell all that's happened is that they have now started dating, personally I wouldn't call that a fully fledged relationship and wouldn't say that it requires that much development.  

I also wouldn't really hold Kataang up as a positive example, because while it's true that they didn't become a thing until after 61 episodes, that also means that there was actually very little time spent developing their romantic relationship, during those 61 episodes they were mostly just friends, other than a few scenes with a romantic undertone.  

Rayllum will have a lot more development, because we will actually get to see them dating. Personally I prefer that over a relationship not becoming official until the very end of the series, because it being at the very end of the series implies a certain amount of longevity to their relationship, it implies that they will have a happily ever after together.  
But when we haven't seen how their relationship works it doesn't actually feel like they earned that implied longevity.  

If Callum and Rayla stay together until the end of the show, and further develop their relationship that whole time, and then it implies that they'll live together happily ever after, then that happily ever after will feel much more earned than it did with Kataang, with Kataang it feels entirely possible that maybe they just don't work as a romantic couple and that they break up a few months after the end of the series.

It also seems like it's a given that Aanya will do the same, her coming to help Ezran means that she also wants to make peace with Xadia, and surely she's also able to predict that this will be one of the conditions that the elves will have.  

As for the other 3 human Kingdoms, I'm pretty sure that they still don't want to make peace with Xadia, their armies being destroyed will hardly make them MORE sympathetic to the idea of peace, so I don't see any reason why they would want to ban dark magic any time soon."
TheDragonPrince,fffi94m,t1_fff28db,1579884539.0,"Personally I really doubt that there's any permanent loss of power from what Viren did to Zym.  

Zym is a magical creature by nature, he has a natural connection to the sky primal.  
So he simply absorbs the magic that is all around him, all the time, in the sky.  

His magic doesn't come from his bodyparts, that's not how primal magic works that's just how dark magic works, his magic comes from the sky, he's able to access it because he's born with the sky arcanum, which isn't an organ that can be stolen.  

Zym understands the sky arcanum and this allows him to access primal magic that is all around him, and causes his body to become ingrained with sky magic, which dark mages can then use after harvesting his body.  

But I don't see what would be stopping Zym from simply regenerating all the magic that Viren took from him, there's sky magic all around him, so there's nothing stopping him from absorbing that magic again and becoming just as ingrained with magic as he was before."

And then after you've done that, you get to use that money in order to increase amount of incentives by that same order of magnitude...  

What will result in more value being produced? Incentivizing one dude with 100 billion, or incentivizing 100.000 people with 1 million each? Or 10.000 people with 10 million each?

Yeah, it's interesting that someone like Rayla doesn't see primal magic as a tool, and that's a very cool contrast to dark mages like Viren or Claudia.  

Reminds me of when Claudia called Zym's egg a dangerous weapon, and Rayla responded with ""it's not a weapon it's an egg!""

Neither was dark magic, yet the mere possibility that he might be able to perform dark magic was enough for him to run after Rayla and to try to help.  

There's no change here, he's always been confident and brave and willing to take a chance to do the right thing, whenever there was actually any reason to believe that he could achieve anything.  

>You see, there we go again. If Callum can't do magic, then unless someone needs an artist he's essentially useless, right?

> It's how well I can use these swords that result in big muscles or not.  

Uhh no not really, just swinging them around creates muscles, doesn't really matter with how much skill you're swinging them around.

You can argue this is because he's done the mental legwork, but regardless of that, he figures out the physical application to magic a lot quicker than the mental side.  

That's just not how, uhhh, time, works.  

If the mental legwork is a prerequisite for flying, then the time that it takes to figure out how to fly is the mental legwork + the physical legwork.  

>There's a lot that goes into how swol a person can get. It involves not only exercise and dieting, but also genetics.

Uhh, it's mainly exercise.  

Dieting and genetics make a marginal difference, but by the time that that difference becomes really relevant, you're already going to be quite swole.

""their art"", I thought you found it on twitter?  

>Fanart of Callum tends to get nitpicked because many fans (a minority, to be sure) disapprove of any future, older Callum that looks taller, stronger, more assertive. That happens to be exactly what you're doing here. You could argue that there's some possible version of athletic Callum you'd be alright with, but right now, that's just a counterfactual. Unless you can point to some ideal version of older Callum that you'd like, this just sounds like bad faith BS.  

Guilty until proven innocent, got it.  

What do you want me to do, go seek out lots of fanart, just to prove that I can also be critical of the fanart of other characters?  
I don't usually comment on fanart, or even seek it out/click on it, because I mostly come here to discuss theories of future seasons or discuss details I've noticed in the storytelling, which I think is why I did comment on this particular piece of fanart, because it's not just art but it's also a theory on what Callum might look like in the future.  

Pretty sure that a lot more people will end up getting offended if I go out of my way to critique tons of fanart, just to prove to you that I don't have some weird grudge against a specific fictional character.  

>It has him with a staff. I wouldn't call it him using a staff.

Lol, talk about bad faith arguments.  
If he has a staff then presumably he also uses it, it doesn't look like it's purely ornamental.  

>Maybe if you had a tinge bit more perspective, you'd realize that you're posing wildly wrong assertions about the show, are being judgmental about someone else's artwork, and then going apeshit when called out on it.

How have I gone apeshit?  

After you responded to disagree with my opinion, in a very passive aggressive way I might add, I defended my opinion by saying stuff like ""I just feel like"", ""IMO"", ""I'm fine with him becoming a bit more muscular"", ""I think"", etc.  

That's a lot of qualifiers and that's me going out of my way to make clear that it's just my personal opinion, while totally ignoring the passive aggressiveness of your response, I didn't respond to your passive aggressiveness and judgements about me as a person until after your second comment where you called me close minded and made further baseless insinuations about me having some weird grudge against Callum.  

If you want to talk about someone going apeshit, lets talk about that.  
I've been trying to make clear how ridiculous your reaction to my very mild and tepid criticism was, by comparing it to how I could respond to the fact that you don't think Callum will grow up to use a staff in combat and how that essentially means that you have a similar criticism of the fanart/theory of a grown up Callum.  
I even quoted your previous comments, with some small rephrasing to make it work, while doing so, maybe if you had a tinge bit more perspective you would've caught on to that.  

>On the one hand, Rayla gets it. She really does. Callum has a crippling lack of confidence, so she can't expect him to jump in with her.

It wasn't a lack of confidence though, it was a lack of relevant skills.  

She can't expect him to jump in with her, because he lacks any sort of skillset that would allow him to face off against dozens of trained and heavily armed soldiers...  

Once he realizes that MAYBE he does have a way to contribute, (and that's a big maybe, he had never done dark magic before and had less of a reason to be confident that it would work than he had to be confident that he could summon mage wings), he immediately does jump after her.  
So he really doesn't seem to have such a severe lack of confidence, other than the totally reasonable lack of confidence in the possibility that his drawing skills could help him defeat a dozen trained soldiers.   

This isn't a change from season 3, he was always willing to jump after Rayla, just so long as he had a reason to believe that there was a chance that he might be able to make a difference.  

He wouldn't have jumped off the spire if he had absolutely no knowledge of the sky arcanum and absolutely zero reason to believe that he could save Rayla."
TheDragonPrince,ff4co5f,t1_ff4arjp,1579560497.0,"> I never said he did criticize Rayla's state of mind. What I said was that, at the end of S3, he started to adopt that state of mind and move away from his more bystander-ish mindset.
> 
> What are we disagreeing about here?

You're acting as if that state of mind is incompatible with what Callum was like in season 2, that he wasn't capable of adopting it until he grew as a person in season 3.  

But I disagree with that, because I think that it was merely because he didn't have the skillset that warranted such a mindset.  

If there was a chance that he could save the dragon using his sketching skills then he would've been rushing down there right alongside Rayla.  

If he still had his primal stone then he would've been rushing down there right alongside Rayla.  

And once he realized that he might be able to perform the same spell that he saw Claudia perform using dark magic, he did in fact rush down there just like Rayla, even though it was still far from certain that he would be able to actually succeed.  

So Callum's willingness to take a chance didn't change, he was already willing to do the exact same thing back in season 2 at the moment when you claim that he wasn't willing to do it, the only thing that changed was whether his skillset warranted such a state of mind or not.  

>You see why this isn't a binary choice, right? Each of these are supposed to work together. Callum can become a good mage by learning the spells and how to cast them. He can become a great mage if he learns to wield his abilities effectively through training.

Sure, but if that ability is drawing runes, then it won't result in very big muscles, and if that ability is flight then I've already explained why I don't think that would result in very big muscles either. (And will explain that further in response to your next point.)  

>...so wait. You think that, if Callum is already strong enough to dive straight down, then fly back up, he, therefore, wouldn't have any muscle growth if he flies over a longer period of time?
>
That's a terrible argument. If I can run for a few minutes, then I can't run indefinitely without further muscle growth.  

There might be some muscle growth, but if he's already strong enough then the main change will be in terms of his endurance not in terms of his muscle growth.  

If I can already comfortably lift 20 kg, then lifting 20 kg every day might cause my muscles to grow a little bit further, but only a little bit, after that the only difference would be to my endurance not to my muscle growth, even if I constantly increase to amount of times that I lift that 20 kg.  

The only way to get my muscles to grow even further, would be to increase the amount of kg's that I lift, rather than how often I lift it.  

That's how you grow muscles, by constantly pushing your limits and doing exercises that require more and more power, by doing exercises that you wouldn't have been powerful enough to do previously."
TheDragonPrince,ff48vy8,t1_ff40j5y,1579558091.0,">That is insanely flawed logic. Callum sees Ibis perform the spell once, and when he tries it himself...he can't do it.  

He wasn't able to unlock the sky arcanum right away either...  

>But it's with the same state of mind that Rayla uses all the time--I'll figure this out on my way down.  

Callum never criticized Rayla's state of mind.  
Rayla's state of mind hinged on Rayla's abilities as a warrior, but Callum didn't have such abilities at the time so he wasn't able to adopt the same state of mind.  
But now he has mage abilities, so he WAS able to adopt the same state of mind and simply trust in his abilities as a mage.  

>These are not mutually exclusive nor contradicting things.  

There's a limited amount of time in a day, so there is in fact a binary choice between whether you spend your time on mental pursuits or physical pursuits.  

Sure, sometimes there may be some overlap, but not always, and I've explained why I don't really believe that the overlap when it comes to flying with his mage wings would explain his muscles.  

(One additional argument for that point though, that I haven't made yet, is that Callum is already strong enough to fly. If he's already strong enough, then flying wouldn't necessarily cause his muscles to grow any further, they're already strong enough so flying would only improve his cardio not his muscles.)"
TheDragonPrince,ff48vbu,t1_ff40j5y,1579558081.0,">We've seen Callum use his arms to redirect the flow of his aspiro,  

Well again, just moving his arms a little is not particularly impressive, anyone could move their arms like that, so the part that makes this impressive is mental and not physical, if not for the mental part then he would just be waving his arms around in a weird and pointless way.  

>or launch into a power-dive once he has his mage wings. He has an intuitive, almost natural understanding for how to apply magic once he has it.  

Yeah, an UNDERSTANDING!  

That's mental, not physical. Where do you think that understanding comes from? It's from his efforts to unlock the arcanum!  

He understands how to fly because he understands the sky arcanum, and as a result he understands how air currents work, how wings interact with them, etc. 
 
Gaining this kind of an understanding of everything related to the sky is what unlocking the arcanum was all about!  

>That mental understanding, however, is relatively harder. It's impressive once he has it, but are you really going to sit there and argue that unlocking the sky arcanum comes just as naturally to him as the above?  

No, I'm going to argue that you're making a distinction that doesn't actually exist.  
Unlocking the arcanum, and that supposedly ""natural understanding"" that you're talking about, are one and the same, they're both the result of the same hard mental work to try to understand the nature of the sky primal.  

>That's analogous to holding a blade in your hand and saying ""honestly, it doesn't require a lot of physical prowess for me to just hold this thing, or even to just jab it into someone.""

Granted, drawing runes and doing it quickly and precisely is surely quite difficult to master.  

But what I'm trying to say by saying that drawing runes isn't really physical, is that the mere movement (even if learning that movement can also be difficult) clearly isn't all that is happening.  
It's not like everyone who knows what shape to draw, would be able to point their finger and start drawing a glowing line in the air, if that were the case then Rayla wouldn't be so surprised by Callum performing the aspiro spell and it would not be enough in order for him to qualify as a mage.  
The ability to jab your finger in the air and draw a glowing line is a special ability that requires an affinity with magic, and since what is happening is more complicated than just jabbing your finger in the air, that affinity must be something that we as the audience can't see, AKA something taking place within his head.  

Again, there's some degree of physical prowess that would be needed for drawing runes, BUT, it's not the kind of physical prowess that would result in a ton of muscle growth, which is what this entire debate is about, me thinking that the amount of muscle growth in the picture is a bit much.  

>But you are contributing to it.

Yeah, but incidentally, not because I have the kind of anti-Callum bias that you're so concerned about.  

This is reminding me of the people who get mad at the show for contributing to the ""bury your gays"" trend, because all the gay characters in the show so far have been killed off, and gay characters being killed off is a shitty trend that exists in media.  

But again, while the trend may be shitty, that doesn't mean that every individual example of a person or a tv show that technically contributes to the trend, is worthy of criticism.  

Because with the bury your gays trope, the real problem isn't that it's inherently wrong to kill off a character that happens to be gay, it's wrong to kill off a character BECAUSE they are gay, it's wrong to kill off gay characters at a rate that is disproportionate to the rate at which you kill of straight characters, to discriminate against them in that way and deny gay people of proper representation.  

But of course that criticism against The Dragon Prince is a bit silly, because The Dragon Prince kills off tons of characters, especially parent figures, not only if they're gay but also if they're straight.  

Similarly, I can assure you that my reason for criticizing this particular picture has nothing to do with any sort of bias specifically against Callum, I would criticize any picture that speculates about what a character might look like in the future, but doesn't fit with how I have interpreted the characterization of that character.  

>There's also no reason to assume that's not something he can get better at if he becomes physically stronger over time.  

It might be something he could train, but as of right now, we can see that the spell magically granted him wings that were strong enough to fly around with, so as of right now it doesn't really display his physical strength.  

I'll grant you that it does display his ability to put his understanding of air currents and wings into practice by physically moving his wings in the correct way, it certainly does take some degree of physical prowess to apply that theoretical understanding of how flying is supposed to work.  

But again, I have never questioned the possibility of Callum achieving a degree of physical prowess, all I have questioned is whether the degree of that physical prowess is as high as the amount of muscles in the picture seems to suggest, whether he would spend so much time on honing his physical prowess that it would result in him gaining so many muscles, rather than spending that time on more mental pursuits.  

(We've already covered our disagreement on whether flying would contribute to his muscle growth, with me taking the position that there's no strong reason to assume that his magical wing muscles have any effect on his non-magical arm muscles, and also pointing out how we don't necessarily have any reason to assume that he will fly around frequently enough to significantly train his muscles even if flying did train his muscles.)  

>There's no reason to assume this somehow isn't a physically demanding exercise.  

No I agree, flying is surely a physically demanding exercise, I'm not questioning that.  
but since his arms magically transform into wings, and then magically transform back into arms again, completely changing all of the bones and muscles in the process, there's every reason to question whether this physically demanding exercise results in any long term muscle growth.  

And again, there's also a reason to question how often he will actually end up performing this particular exercise, I imagine that most of the stuff he will be doing will be on the ground, not in the air.  
Flying could be useful for travel, but now that Zym is back home there won't necessarily be a need for him to constantly travel all over the place, and even if there were, he would likely be travelling with some companions and would need to take into account the fact that they can't fly, so unless he wants to scout ahead he would probably end up travelling in the same way that his companions travel.  

>I never denied it, but you somehow think that learning to incorporate martial arts and physical prowess with spellcasting isn't enough, and that Callum has to learn this whole other skill (like Viren melee fighting with his staff) to compensate for his shortcomings. That's what I said before--taking my words out of context doesn't really do anything good for your credibility.
>
If Callum has to figure out ways to defend himself in a battle, the most natural way to do it would be to parlay his spellcasting into hand-to-hand combat and vice versa. That's exactly what we see Aaravos do.



Fun fact: The picture we are talking about has Callum using a staff as well.  

So right now you are criticizing the staff in the picture, in exactly the same way that I'm criticizing the muscles in the picture.  

What do you have against Callum using a staff?!!?!   

Are you intimidated by Callum using a staff!?!?  



Why do you want Callum to be so incompetent at melee fighting, why do you insist that he can only fight using spellcasting or unarmed combat, why do you define him solely by being a spellcaster and deny that he might be able to learn how to use a melee weapon!?!  

WHY DO YOU HATE CALLUM!?!? HOW DARE YOU!!!?!? STOP POLICING FAN ART!!!  

My opinion is you have this narrow minded view of the kind of person Callum is, and insist he cant possibly grow beyond his 14 year old self.  

Just curious, what kinds of fighting skills is Callum allowed to have before it's ""unnatural""? Is he allowed to use brass knuckles?  
Is he allowed to have a rudimentary ability to fight with a staff, or is that still too much?  
Id just like to get a sense of this so I we dont offend anyones sensitivities moving forward.  

>He's also flying as well, if you recall. That takes energy too  

Yeah, but that energy is used in his magic wing muscles, not in his regular human arm muscles, it's uncertain whether that muscle growth will carry over when he changes between regular arms and magical wings.  

>It is portrayed as a bad thing, even if Rayla understands why he feels like he can't. She tells him that, to break the cycle, someone has to take a stand.  

That's not a criticism of Callum...  

She says, and I quote: ""It's okay Callum, I'm not asking you to come with me.  Protecting that dragon doesn't just feel like the right thing to do, it feels like the right thing for ME to do, it's where I'm meant to be."""

>
It's analogous to how, for instance, Korra in LOK was very good at bending but had to work to master the spiritual and mental side of the craft.  

I just don't understand how that's the way that you see it.  

Surely you'll agree that unlocking the sky arcanum is the most impressive magical feat that he has accomplished? That's literally pure brain power, it's not even remotely connected to anything physical, the definition of an arcanum is that it's the understanding of ""the secret of primal source, or its meaning"".  

Anyway, again, I think that saying that drawing a rune is the ""physical"" side of magic is really stretching the definition of ""physical"", it doesn't really require a lot of strength or fitness, or balance, or really anything related to physical prowess.  

Anyone can put their finger in the air and draw the right shape, clearly there's more to being a mage than that, and from what I can tell that ""more"" is purely mental.  

>You talk about understanding the world and memorizing runes and incantations as though these are separate considerations. Yet there's definitely more to spells than simply understanding the world on the one hand, and memorizing the physical steps to casting. Callum can't conjure mage wings on his first few tries, so it's not a matter of mere memorization that was the issue here.

Yes, memorization wasn't the issue, so it must have been his understanding of the sky primal or of this specific spell, right?  

If being able to perform the spell wasn't mental, wasn't about gaining some sort of additional understanding or having the right mindset, then please explain: what physical attribute/skill allowed Callum to finally perform the spell?  

My interpretation is that it's similar to when he finally unlocked the sky arcanum, in his fever dream, Sarai said:  

>>""sometimes you just need to focus on the present, take a deep breath, and just be. Sometimes things can get so complicated that our minds can't quite sort them out alone. But when you slow down and let yourself breathe, your spirit and your body can catch up with your mind, and help out.  
To know something truly and deeply, you must know it with your head, hand, and heart. Mind, body, and spirit.  
I love you with all of myself, and I always will.""  

My interpretation has always been that his ability to perform the wing spell is related to that monologue from his mom/fever dream, since he calmed down, took a deep breath, and declared his love for Rayla, before he was finally able to perform the spell, basically following his mom's advice which was also what finally allowed him to unlock the arcanum.  

Which, again, seems to me to be a mental feat more than anything. I guess you could argue that him committing his body to the task by jumping off the cliff is what counted as his body declaring its love for Rayla, so that's physical, but it's of absolutely no relevance in terms of his physical prowess and aptitude and how much muscle he'll grow.  

>Having opinions is fine except it's only with Callum that this happens. No one has any issues with people taking an artistic license with any other major character, but there's always at least one person insisting that fanart shouldn't depict Callum as more than they think he should be allowed to be.

This may be true, it may not be, I haven't noticed such a pattern.  

Either way, why the fuck does this mean that you have such a big problem with me?  

I'm not personally responsible for an online trend that may or may not exist...  

>And this is where the analogy to martial arts comes from. For Callum to effectively cast spells in the midst of a battle, he'd have to draw runes quickly and move on. That's fundamentally no different from how martial artists learn forms and improve on their skills, other than that spellcasting has to be more precise.

OK, so that shows that he has to practice his rune-drawing skills.  

As I've said before, I just don't see how that helps explain him becoming especially muscular, drawing runes isn't so physically demanding that it triggers a whole lot of muscle growth, even if you do it quickly.  

>You said so yourself--to cast spells effectively in the midst of a battle, the caster should be able to handle themselves in close combat.

Well, glad to see that you have now finally admitted that casting spells does cost time and that this can be a weakness for a mage, and that learning how to handle yourself in melee combat is a smart idea for a mage.   
And while yes, becoming as muscular as possible would technically do an even better job at remedying that weakness, as opposed to just becoming somewhat muscular but mainly focusing on the athletic side of it and not doing any workouts in order to build muscles.  

But my point is that in the end, he's still a mage, he's going to rely on magic, he'll only need to be fit and athletic enough to buy enough time to cast another spell, he won't be very motivated to go beyond that, and in my opinion the amount of muscles in the picture suggests that he does go beyond that, which is why it's not quite how I personally picture Callum in the future.  

> In this case, Callum is no longer going to sit around and wait to figure out a plan, like he does in S2.  

He does have a plan, just not a complete one in which he has thought through every step and is absolutely certain about everything. (He didn't have that when he saved the dragon either, after all he had never tried dark magic before, just like he had never successfully cast the wing spell either.)  

Also, him waiting around in season 2 is not at all portrayed as a bad thing or something that he has to grow beyond, it's totally reasonable and smart and Rayla supports him in his decision to stay behind.  

He resents having to stay behind, but he doesn't suddenly reject the logic for staying behind, he finds a reason for why the logic is no longer valid by coming up with a way in which he CAN contribute.  

Which is the same as what he does in season 3, he finds a way in which he can save Rayla, and that way relies on him figuring out a spell, and I'd say that him figuring out the arcanum is reason enough to believe that figuring out the spell is also plausible.  
It's not like my argument relies on Callum being a total coward who never takes any chances or does anything without an absolute guarantee of success, my argument is simply that he's someone who relies on his head more than on his muscles, and that he would therefore spend more time training his head and less time training his muscles, and would therefore not have quite as many muscles as in this picture."
TheDragonPrince,ff3lzzf,t1_ff3fter,1579543901.0,"> All of his shortcomings can be chalked up to being a 14 year old.  

I think that 14 years is more than old enough to get a general sense of what someone's talents are and what kinds of things they excel at or are less good at.  

>He struggles to understand the Sky Arcanum,  

It's not easy, but it's a monumental almost unprecedented feat, and he does get it done, and then immediately moves on to try to figure out the moon arcanum as well.  
So I'd still say that he shows that he has a lot of talent.  

>But if he simply looks athletic, why is that any worse than if Callum was physically empowered by magic?

Because one would be the result of regular physical exercise, which just isn't how I picture Callum spending much of his time, and the other is the result of a spell or of having unlocked an arcanum.  

For some reason you've decided that I'm ""intimidated"" by Callum being strong, but that's simply not true at all, so I have absolutely zero reason to be opposed to him being empowered by magic.  
(Lightning is way stronger than any muscles will ever be...)  

>Again, this is a deliberate misread of the way Primal Magic works. It's clearly more than just memorization,  

Which is why I talk about ""understanding""...  

I never even remotely implied that I think primal magic is solely about memorization, so you're the only one deliberately misreading things.  

>but even without magic, his skills as a mage would make him pretty adept at hand-to-hand combat.  

I really just don't agree that him having quickly drawn a few runes is enough evidence of that.  

But also, being skilled at hand to hand combat is entirely different from being super buff.  

As I've already said a million times I'm not opposed to Callum becoming more athletic and physically capable over time, I'm just opposed to him being as buff as pictured, because that implies that he spends an amount of time and attention to physical exercise that just doesn't fit with his character IMO.  

>If you think he looks like a weightlifter...you haven't really seen many examples of that, have you?  

I think he looks like someone who lift weights.  
Cmon look at those muscles, that's Chris Evans level muscles, you don't get that just by sparring and practicing martial arts occasionally, that requires deliberate workouts.  

>No, Callum would need to become fit because it would help with spellcasting.  

Do you have any basis whatsoever for such a claim?  
How and why does spellcasting require muscles or fitness?  

From what we know about primal magic, all it requires is that you understand the arcanum and that you know the right runes and incantations. (And it seems like specific spells also require an additional level of understanding, since the mage wing spell is difficult even for people who know the sky arcanum.)  

At what point do muscles and fitness come in as a requirement of primal magic?  
As far as I can tell the only stage at which they're even remotely relevant is when drawing runes, so yeah fair enough, being fitter would help you draw runes faster.  

But again, I've already said a million times that I'm not opposed to Callum being fit, I'm just opposed to him being as muscular as he is in the picture, that level of muscles (and we can disagree about how we interpret the artstyle or what level of muscle it shows), isn't something that results from, or even necessarily helps with, quickly drawing runes.  

>Unless he's jumping off the Storm Spire, in which case, screw what you think you can do if you have to save someone.

He does that while knowing that it's possible to grow magic wings...  
I don't see how it contradicts with what I'm saying.  

>Character development. What even is that, right?

Character development involves exploring a character's strengths and weaknesses, showing in which areas they display a strong aptitude and in which areas they show less aptitude.  
That doesn't always need to change, every character has strengths and weaknesses, even fully developed ones, fully developing a character doesn't mean erasing their weaknesses and making them super competent at everything."

TheDragonPrince,ff3ajbr,t1_ff35lyi,1579537433.0,">To call him incompetent simply because he thinks he's incompetent is just affirming his self-esteem issues unquestionably without looking at what the show is telling us.

I'm not calling him wholly incompetent, I'm just saying that it seems to me like his area of expertise lies mainly with more mental skills like magic, whereas he has shown far less of a natural aptitude for every physical activity that he's tried.  
Which doesn't automatically stop him from ever gaining any skill in any physical activity, as I've said numerous times by now, but when the bulk of his talent lies in his mental skills then to me it makes more sense for him to be less buff than this image shows him as, simply because of how he would likely be spending his time.  

(Even if flying helps build muscle mass, there's really no reason to assume that he'll spend THAT much time flying, especially if he also starts unlocking the other arcanums.)  

>It's a disagreement based on nothing. It's been pointed out to you how mage wings are a physical activity, and your response amounts to ""I don't like it.""

It's literally magic, the idea that the rules for magic have far more leeway than the rules for regular biology is not as far-fetched as you're making it out to be, even if you disagree with me you could at least acknowledge that...  

>Funny that you refused to answer my question--you'd be okay if Callum simply was this strong, just as long as he didn't look this strong? If so, I don't know why you find this fanart so intimidating.

I don't know why you think that I find it intimidating, why you're making such ridiculous far-reaching conclusions about my character based on a very mild and subjective comment on a piece of fanart and on what I personally think a future Callum might look like.  

I didn't answer it because it seems like a totally pointless question, but yes I would be fine with Callum being empowered by magic in the same way that other mages are empowered by magic, including Callum being empowered by a full moon if he ever unlocks the moon arcanum, I don't see why I wouldn't be.  

>When he's latched onto magic as the source of his confidence in himself, he does think he's nothing without it. It's pointed out to him, and he himself realizes in season 2, just how untrue that is. After his character development, at no point does Callum ever define himself as solely being a mage.

The fact remains that the only two things that have ever felt natural to him, magic and drawing, are not very physical, and that he wasn't very good at any of the physical things that he tried and didn't feel like he was really cut out for those things.  
I'm not making any absolute statements about his physical abilities and potential, I've never said that he has zero potential in that area I've said numerous times that I expect Callum to become more athletic.  
The show doesn't tell us that he's COMPLETELY useless with physical stuff, but I do believe that it tells us that his main talents lie elsewhere, with magic, which is largely a mental task of understanding the world and memorizing runes and incantations.  

With a bit more confidence, I'm sure he'll be able to learn how to properly ride a horse, eventually, but that doesn't invalidate his past statements, there's absolutely no reason to doubt that these kinds of physical activities are less natural and less within his comfort zone than other things, even if his shame about that fact is probably a bit over the top and the resulting lack of self esteem is a bit too harsh.  

> Again, it's like assuming Runaan does Orange Theory or Crossfit, and that's the reason he's more buff than any of the assassins. And not that it's because he's, you know, an assassin.

He's more buff than the **other assassins**, because he's an assassin? Do you really need me to hold your hand while explaining the flaw of that argument?  

>And again, its not like we haven't seen other Primal Mages before. Lujanne is an old woman, yet can outpace Callum. Aaravos is no slouch in the physical department. There's clearly something about being fit that helps being a mage.

I must have missed the scene where Callum and Lujanne were in a sprinting contest, and I have no idea why you keep holding Aaravos up as an example, since he has no defined muscles and looks very feminine for a man, rather than looking like a very fit and strong man.  
He has no noteworthy physical feats, all he's done is draw a few runes, which hardly requires an incredible amount of strength and stamina, using him as an example of how amazingly fit all mages supposedly are makes absolutely no sense.  

>Which is funny, given that you think Callum is defined (or defines himself) by a single trait, while Ibis has more dimensions than him?

I merely believe that Callum has more of an aptitude for some things than he does for others, and that the amount of muscle in this picture suggests a greater aptitude for physical activities than I think Callum has.  
That's it, that's all, you're accusing me of having overly binary opinions that I simply do not have, you're arguing against a strawman.  

>You're comparing an experienced Dark Mage to an inexperienced Primal Mage. Callum only knows two spells that he can use at this point. Were he, for instance, able to use spells the way we see Aaravos do so, he wouldn't need to retreat, nor have to use a staff for a melee fight.

So he would have less of a reason to work out and become fit? Ok...  

Again, I really don't know why you're so motivated to argue with me on this point, wtf have I done to make you so incredibly hostile towards me that you feel compelled to disagree with absolutely everything I say even when I'm on your fucking side with this particular point?  

>Haha maybe from Lord of the Rings, but the stereotypical mage has certainly changed since then.

Gandalf was never a frail old man in LOTR, he fought with a sword more often than he fought with magic.  
However, many of the tropes that have been inspired by LOTR are based on many people's very poor understanding of LOTR, so that doesn't mean that the trope isn't still that wizards tend to be frail old men.  

You can disagree with me on this point if you really want, but you'd also be disagreeing with the writers of the show, because they also seem to believe that the standard wizard trope is that they're old and wrinkly.  
Ellis said something along those lines when saying that Callum isn't what she expected, and [they themselves said something along those lines when talking about how they decided to make Ibis a ""hot"" man, rather than a ""Gandalf-ish old man"".](https://i.redd.it/o32cyzs0qk141.jpg)

>That's...not what academic means. There's nothing stopping Soren or Rayla from observing and trying to get a full understanding of everything before leaping into a fight. That hardly makes them academic.

Well, my point was about what Callum's mindset is and how he tends to interact with the world.  
He observes and learns and relies more on his head than on muscles, hence why I don't see him having very large muscles, it's that simple."

Callum has literally said himself, multiple times, that before he discovered that he was a mage he was always bad at everything.  

>""I've always been kind of bad at, well... Everything.  
>>""Without this (the primal stone) I'm nothing, just a guy who can draw and make wry comments from time to time."" 
>>>""Growing up I was supposed to learn horseriding, swordfighting, archery, battle tactics, but I was so bad at everything. But then I tried magic, and it felt right, it felt like I was finally good at something.""

I'm not being disparaging I'm literally just taking what the show is telling us, that Callum has never been very good at anything other than drawing and magic.  

What did we see of his daily life before they left Katolis? We saw him suck at swordfighting and horseriding, we saw him draw, and we saw him go to the library to pick out some books to take on their trip.  
So, he's a guy who draws and reads books, and who in his own words was always bad at everything else.  

I don't see why you think that taking those facts and using the term ""nerdy"" to encompass them, is so incredibly disparaging.  

Point is that he was never skilled at anything physical, and that I simply don't see why him learning magic would result in such a major change that he suddenly becomes very buff.  

You think that flying with magic wings will make him buff, I do not, that's a simple disagreement there's absolutely no need to be such a judgemental dick about that.  

>Occam's Razor, my dude. One should select the explanation with the fewest assumptions. Here, are we to conclude Ibis looks athletic because he can fly (a physical activity), or something else that has nothing to do with being a mage and hasn't ever been touched on?

But it IS touched on, it became a part of his character the moment that they showed how fit he is.  
You're the only one making assumptions, by assuming that you know the reason why he's fit. I'm not making any assumptions I'm accepting my ignorance and am open to any explanation they give, but also fine with it remaining unexplained.  

>
Do I...have to explain to you where strength, speed, and endurance are typically gained? 

Do I have to explain to you how magic is magic, and the whole point is that it doesn't follow the regular laws of physics?  
If it worked through their muscles then wouldn't they suddenly all become swole during a full moon? But that doesn't happen, because it's magical strength and it doesn't need to follow the same rules that regular strength has to follow.  

>This is hilarious. You were just defining Callum by a single trait (him being a nerd).  

Callum defines himself by a single trait, being a mage.  
Being a mage means drawing runes and saying incantations, it's based entirely on knowledge and understanding of magic.  

The point is simply that none of the things that he's good at or defines himself as require a whole lot of regular exercise or physical activity that would result in lots of muscles, but instead they solely require knowledge and understanding, mental skills, which I simplify by calling it nerdy, to avoid having to type out an entire paragraph each time. (we've already covered our disagreement about magical wing muscles.) 

>If Ibis has an athletic build because of reasons apart from his ability to fly, but that's never explained, that's not good writing.

I completely disagree, it would hint at there being more to him than JUST a mage, that although to us he's just a minor character who is only relevant because he's a sky mage, there is actually more to him than that.  
It's good writing because it's a good way (that doesn't take up a bunch of screentime) to give minor characters more depth, instead of them being super 2 dimensional and defined by the one trait that makes them relevant to the plot.  

>...they are different. A Dark Mage needs raw materials for his casting, a Primal Mage does not.

Sure, but a primal mage does (generally) need runes.  
It's not entirely the same, but drawing runes and pulling out ingredients both take time, and we've seen both Viren and Callum in a situation where they didn't have enough time to cast a spell, causing Viren to use his staff to melee fight, and causing Callum to simply run away.  

Again I have to question why in the hell you're even arguing with me on this point, I'm using this point to highlight why I also think that it makes sense for Callum to become more athletic and muscular, because I see it as a neccesary part of being a mage...  

You're being so unneccesary hostile to me that you're even arguing against me when I'm supporting YOUR side of the argument...  

>Why do you assume that every single aspect of Callum's character is explained by him being a nerd? 

I'm not making such an assumption, I'm merely using that word as an easy way to encompass what I believe we have learned about him over the course of 3 seasons, that his talents lie mostly in more intellectual pursuits rather than physical ones.  
He may not have unlocked the sky arcanum by reading dusty tomes, but it was still a matter of knowledge and understanding, it was still a mental exercise rather than a physical one.  

>So, hold on, you don't think an older guy with a beard could be this fit either? Damn, I think you have some stereotypes to work out of.

Ugh no, I'm not describing what *I* think, I'm describing what a stereotypical mage is like, old, bearded, and likely to have a crooked back and to need a cane to walk.  

That's not a stereotype that I believe in, that's just a stereotype that exists in the world.  

>To me it looks like they identified with Callum because he was incompetent and bad at everything""

In that comment I was talking about what I believed someone else's view of Callum was like, I was not describing my own view of Callum...  
Nice to once again see how eager you are to take me out of context though, and to once again attack me when I'm actually backing up your side of the argument, which I was doing in that comment, I was arguing against someone who believed that Callum shouldn't be as competent as he is by the end of season 3...  

I don't believe Callum is incompetent and bad at everything, he's smart and good at the mental tasks that are required to learn magic, and as I've said numerous times already I also believe that he's capable of becoming more athletic as well, I just don't think that it will ever be where his main strength lies and therefore I had the mild criticism of thinking that his muscles in this picture were *a bit* too large, while actually agreeing with the concept of Callum becoming more muscular...  

Still don't understand why that bothers you so much.

>In what universe is Callum an ""academic type""? He has no academic understanding of magic; all he's learned of magic, it's been through observation and exploring the elements.

With ""academic"", I simply meant that he's someone who observes and works to understand stuff, someone who is slightly more focused on a mental task like that, and more likely to observe and try to understand rather than rushing in with his fists or swords without having a full understanding of everything.  
Take the episode where they save the downed dragon, Rayla rushes in to help, but Callum stays back and does nothing, *until* he comes up with a way in which he can help in a meaningful way.  
I consider that an academic attitude.  
Although upon googling the definition of ""acadamic"" just now I did discover that it has the connotation of being purely theoretical and not practical, which I was not aware of, forgive me, English is not my 1st language.  

(In my opinion it's kind of a shitty way to define ""academic"", because it has the disparaging implication that I do NOT mean to convey, that nerdy scholarly types are useless when it comes to practical issues.)  

Obviously learning primal magic does require a practical understanding of each primal source, but I don't believe that something being practical automatically makes it less of a mental exercise."

>I think it's cute how so many people push back and argue ""well, you don't know that Ibis is buff because he's a mage! Maybe he just likes doing push-ups!""

There's absolutely no reason to dismiss that possibility...  
In fact, it makes a lot more sense than it being a direct result of being a mage. 

> Moreover, as we saw with Moon Magic, proximity to the Moon Primal enhances one's strength, speed, and endurance--that doesn't happen with Dark Magic.

So it actually lessens the need for muscles...  
Not sure how that's supposed to support your argument.  

>Like, c'mon. Aaron and Justin are not amateur writers. If Ibis has an athletic build that is never explained as some kind of separate, nonmagical pastime, then it's because he's a mage.

That's a complete non-sequitur, and I have no idea why you would think that every character being completely defined by a single trait, like being a mage, is a requirement for good writing.  

>But that's also beside the point; Callum isn't a Viren. He shares very little in common with him (in fact, the whole point of their foil is how opposite they are).

Their role in combat is still going to be similar, whether it's primal magic or dark magic, casting a spell costs time and they can't afford to be completely defenseless in-between casting spells.  

Anyway, I have no idea why you're arguing against me even when I'm making the case for why I do in fact think that it makes sense for Callum to become fitter and more athletic than he currently is, just shows how hostile you are against me for no damn reason.  

>A good microcosm of this argument occurs at the end of the Final Battle--Callum lays down his inseparable sketchbook, and dives off the pinnacle without knowing if he could save Rayla. After this moment, his sketchbook is never seen again.

I sincerely doubt that his sketchbook will disappear.  

>Callum wasn't about to win that fight no matter how strong he was

No, but if he were more athletic then he would have a better chance of staying alive and creating enough distance to buy enough time to cast another spell.  

>I can imagine that Viren probably spends most of his time studying magic through books and academic study. Do you know who hasn't learned magic this way?
>
Callum.
>
He learns Primal Magic entirely through observation.  

Totally true.  
Observing the world still wouldn't make him this buff though.  
Muscles like in this picture don't come from freaking hiking or any other sort of cardio, it comes from weightlifting.  
I don't expect that learning primal magic will require a lot of regular weightlifting.  

I totally agree that Callum will likely spend more time outside, in nature, but he'll still be an observer, someone who relies more on observation and intelligence than on getting his hands dirty with manual labor, so I still don't see how he would get the amount of muscle that is shown in this picture.  

Again, I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH CALLUM BECOMING MORE MUSCULAR, I JUST THINK THIS PICTURE IS A BIT OVER THE TOP!  

He's more muscular than Ibis FFS, so you keep using Ibis as an example but even if Callum was exactly like Ibis then the amount of muscle on this picture would still be over the top.  

>Seems safer than assuming Ibis has some kind of gym membership that keeps him swol.

Why? Why would you assume that every single aspect of Ibis's character is explained by him being a sky mage?  

That makes absolutely no sense, especially if you look up what the creators said about how they designed Ibis's character.  
They were originally going to go with an older guy with a beard, classic wizard trope, but then they decided to go with a fit younger guy instead.  

So they purposely defy wizard tropes with Ibis's character, yet here you are assuming that literally every part of Ibis's character is defined by the fact that he's a wizard...  

>All mage wings does is give you wings instead of arms (that's all manus pluma volantis tranlsates to). It doesn't increase your muscle mass on your chest or your arms, and it doesn't make flying any less of a physical activity.

Like you said, it changes your arms into wings, so how you can then go on to assume that it doesn't change the muscle mass of your arms is beyond me.  

It literally turns your arms into wings, OF COURSE IT CHANGES THE MUSCLES IN YOUR ARMS, the way that wings move is totally different from how human arms move.  

>I mean, it's not an assumption, let alone a baseless one, when it's pretty evident.

Lets see some evidence then...  

>You've used the term ""nerdy"" in a disparaging way 

Absolutely nothing disparaging about it, that's just more of your baseless assumptions.  

>and then assumed that, because Viren and Callum are both nerds (a highly flawed assumption; Callum's not really that nerdy), they must want to learn magic the same way, even though these are different types of magic. 

They're both academic types, who's main occupation doesn't require the kind of regular hard labor/exercise that results in a ton of muscles, is all I meant."
