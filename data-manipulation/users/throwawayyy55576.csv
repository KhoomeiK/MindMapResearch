So it is evolutionarily useful to have suicide be a thing in order to protect the rest of the tribe, when you can no longer provide any value whatsoever but you still consume food.

But that's not a problem today so that reason is invalid. So even if it is evolutionary, and the patterns that trigger suicidal thoughts get triggered in our brains, it's for the wrong reason. 

Unless you suffer from life-long pain inducing stuff that can't be treated or managed with pain-killers, then suicide is not the option. And that's coming from someone who's had suicidal thoughts for years and as recent as this week.

It doesn't mean it's not true or real. We like food because it keeps us alive and thriving, so dopamine (or whatever) is released. That's the same with friends or loving your SO. It's something that's good at keeping you alive (being part of a social group) and spreading the genes (the genes being the programming for those dopamine systems in the first place).

So even though we are just vessels for our selfish genes to replicate... so what? we can have ""fun"" while we're at it. There is no point to life, as far as science can tell us, life was an accident, with no purpose. I'm just happy we have something like dopamine to make us feel good about stuff.

At first I felt the same... depression was still there, I felt alone when hanging out with people, all sorts of intrusive thoughts (some of which still pop up sometimes). But it is getting better. It just takes a long time to recover naturally.

The way I see it, all the damage I did to myself for over a decade of self-neglect is not going to heal so quickly... and life isn't some perfect disney world at the moment either, so healing is slow and hard, but I do feel better than before.

unpopularopinion,fei7eae,t1_fehe9kd,1579131940.0,"While this sounds sketchy to me as well, I think we fail to realize how much society and therefore social norms are changing due to technology. These newer generations were born with and into social media, this is how they communicate and how they interact, it's therefore how they will grieve. If you think about it, at funerals we put the dead person on display for anyone who is there to see. We accept that because that's how things were when we grew up. Social media is the world they are growing up with. I don't think you are able to stop it, it's human nature to change from one generation to the next, not necessarily for the better, but it's the only way we can make progress as well.

Edit to add: social media has changed the meaning of being around people: we used to have two separate groups: those physically around us, that we talk to face to face and share our most intimate experiences with, and those who were far, to whom you might write a letter or, more recently, call once a week.

Now we have everyone at our fingertips. It's why teens rarely say goodbye in a chat: your not leaving. You say something and then say something again when there's something to say, a minute, an hour or a day later. As of they're right next to you. With this in mind, it becomes far less surprising that people feel it's ok to share intimate moments with social media."
