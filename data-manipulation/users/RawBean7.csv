worldnews,ffi3k69,t1_ffhwgon,1579964063.0,"I think people are discrediting the Chinese government because of their long history of not telling the truth, policing speech, and committing human rights violations. While I'm not buying into the theories that this is a bioweapon they've unleashed on their own population, I do think their actions should always be examined with a fair amount of scrutiny.   


China has 4-5 times the population of the US, and as of today they are saying about 1000 reported cases. If the US had 200-250 reported cases, should the government quarantine Seattle and Chicago and close Disney parks and all the movie theaters and restaurants? Even 250 cases in one large US city wouldn't shut everything down if it is a basic respiratory illness that most survive except the elderly and immune-compromised . They would tell people to wash their hands more, stay home if experiencing symptoms, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.  


That said, China does not have any where near the public sanitation and health regulations present in the US, and has a much higher population density, so I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. They are likely misrepresenting the data to the outside world to save face, while taking strict preventative and PR measures internally and externally to get control over the situation."

Don't let money paid towards rent bother you too much. Renting is not money paid towards an investment, but it is not money wasted. You had a place to live for four years, you weren't on the hook for environmental damages or maintenance repairs, and you had the freedom to leave at the end of your lease. It's not free money for the landlord, either. They still have to pay property taxes, income taxes, employee wages, all renovations and maintenance, and damages from pets and irresponsible renters. Buying a house is a serious financial commitment with long-term implications. Someone just starting out should rent a while to get a handle on paying monthly payments. If you plan to move within 5 years, buying a house rarely nets more than it costs in additional fees to purchase, list, and sell."

personalfinance,feze7dy,t1_fezaarw,1579456447.0,"Buying a house isn't just the down payment though, and finding a house in that part of MA for 200k is unheard of without serious renovations or issues. In addition to a down payment, you have to pay for inspections closing costs, which include appraisals, realtor fees, etc. and easily add up to at least another 3-5%. On top of the mortgage, you have to pay property taxes, PMI, and homeowner's insurance. This guy is moving out of his parents house, so assume he has no furniture. Even a bed, desk, table, couch, and dresser from Ikea will run you another 2k. Plus, you need to have a solid emergency fund, because houses cost money to live in. Things break. You don't just have to maintain the interior, but the exterior as well. Things like a lawnmower, vacuum cleaner, snow blower, etc. all add up."

personalfinance,fe4h0lf,t3_enr9rq,1578859197.0,"My comment comes from the American cultural perspective, so it may be different in your country. I think what you are being given here is more valuable than a wage, and you should accept what you are given for now. What you are really being given is an opportunity to break your streak of unemployment. This is worth so much more long-term than a few Euro per hour. You don't have to love every job that you do, but you should try your best to make this work, for at least six months. Then you can ask for a raise or look for a higher paying job that you like better, but right now you are not in a position to ask for more. Here, we have a saying that ""You are only worth what someone is willing to pay you"" and for you that has been  € 0 for a while. Jumping to  € 11 is a massive raise, so prove you are worth more through your work and then ask for it."
personalfinance,fe4dxbi,t3_enrf2x,1578858277.0,"I was in a similar situation a year ago. Conventional, fixed loans are your best option. If your market is hot and you need to get in before you are priced out, you may want to look into buying points for your mortgage. This increases your closing costs but can reduce your interest rate. What rate were you quoted and have you shopped around? Interest rates are pretty low right now. In our case, paying a less than ideal interest rate and buying it down a little was the best option considering the rising costs of rent (ours was averaging a 12% increase year over year). Keep working on your credit (we both now have scores in the 700 and 800s) and if/when the recession hits and interest rates plummit, you can refinance to get better rates. If your house is going to gain a lot of value quickly, you can reappraise to ditch PMI when the time is right. As long as you can actually afford it, and you have enough saved back for all the costs associated with home ownership, I think you should go for it."

It's harder to move forward and try again if you think you failed once already, because your brain is registering failure as the outcome of attempting. Weight loss and maintenance is not easy, and almost no one gets something hard right the first time they attempt it. You've learned a lot of lessons about yourself, like what works and what events and temptations throw you off track. Those lessons are your new, better tool set that make you more likely to achieve your goals again and maintain them.   


I lost a lot of weight 10 years ago, and while I haven't ever gotten to my SW, I've swung up and down in the same 30 lbs for too long. I've worked my way up to the highest I've been in years and a nice kick of depression didn't help the hedonistic past few months I've had. I quit going to the gym, stopped eating well and started smoking again after 15 months without nicotine. I just started a new gym (old membership expired and I didn't love it there anyways) and have stopped smoking and am back to my healthier eating habits. I'm frustrated with myself but I can't change the past and I've already started the work to change my future with better knowledge of the habits I need to maintain and pitfalls to avoid or mitigate in order to maintain the person I want to be (not just weight, but lifestyle as well).
