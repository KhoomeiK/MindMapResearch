depression,fd7amvv,t1_fcwdu7f,1578201632.0,"I feel like people open up in order to get used and crushed by others who they put their whole heart and attention on but are not appreciative of what you do for them so it's pretty hard to think that a person would miss you when you are gone when all they are is backstabbing, unsupportive and a huge headache to work with because they don't understand and don't put much care to you as you put on to them.  Nobody ever gives a shit, makes you feel like your the only person who is nice because your obligated to be kind and caring and get nothing in return. Human beings treat each other like they like importance. I always think I don't matter in this life, I feel like I don't have any friends and family, they treat me bad and all I do I care about them but all they do is always make me feel worse"
depression,fcypw90,t3_ejeyfi,1578084666.0,"I'm always alone, I've been so depressed and suicidal and still have the encourage to live b it I don't want to and at some point I want to die soon. I have no one to run to, to open up, to spend time with me or even care about me, no one acknowledges that I exist.  I spend more time online because I will never have anyone in reality to distract me or need me. I feel so out of place in this world forever unsatisfied and happy loneliness occupies me because no one want to be around me because other people have things to look forward to and will never have time for me."
depression,fcp1idz,t3_ei5th0,1577847603.0,I can't stand New Years Eve or any other holiday makes me feel worthless and is depressing to hear all the time constantly reminding me how much I don't have anyone to spend time with or have anything uplifting to do with others and so I don't have social media because it's a waste of time and it makes me feel worse seeing other people having better a good time and having the best time of their lives that I would never have. I just sit in my room crying uncontrollably knowing how loneliness is inevitable for me and cope with life by drawing playing games along with writing poetry thinking what it would be like to leave this life because I have no family and friends to be with because I'm not that important.
depression,fcp1095,t1_fbyqy73,1577847172.0,Well okay then
SuicideWatch,fbzjnsc,t3_efbjmk,1577248947.0,"I always thought that having a relationship will solve my life but it doesn't just makes me more worthless because I'm always worried things won't turn out right because of the type of person I am and how depressing I feel and don't want to bother anyone about how unhappy I am because they'll never understand.  It just makes me more depressed. I know I am, I can relate to everything you said here"
