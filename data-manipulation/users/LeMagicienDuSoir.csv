Now it is obviously LGBT+ coded, that doesn't change much, it's not a property of straight people to change their expressions over time before it annoys people.

For example, as long as you know it's fiction you watch someone being murdered, tortured (Prison Break is a proof I think), now rape as long as it's not explicitly showed is usually felt with disgust but not much more than that. Now if you go a bit lower, lolicons dissociate real children and fictional in the context of anime yet they can still recognize them as children. Now to prove that the latter is denial, do you think a lolicon would masturbate if the child in question could be recognized as a 2 years old or lower. I mean lower as in ''between 0 and 2''. It's still fictional and the only factor is that, just as the others, you can approximately tell their age. Do you think it's an exaggerated example or that another factor come in play ? Or is it still acceptable as long as you don't touch real babies ?

Psychoanalysis works (I'm a cognivist, I know that it's not the most efficient therapy but it does work), but I think it doesn't work because of what it says happen, but because of something else.
In thar regards, it's no different than a religion.
Now the question is, is it needed to find how it works if it works? Obviously the answer is yes, because if we know why it works most of the time, we can probably find a way for it to works every time.

tumblr,fegpl7l,t1_feg2j0t,1579099521.0,"Apparently not that many people here know wtf Freud did saying he was wrong. He was right on a lot of things and what people feel as wrong is often psychoanalysis. He wasn't wrong, psychoanalysis cannot be disproven and is still heavily used around the world. What some people answering you understood is that he said that people wanted to fuck their mother. It's all kind of wrong. Sexuality in psychoanalysis is meant to be understood as ''gender and sexual orientation''  (not exactly but there's a reason why it's a field of study and that's all you need to know for now) . In the life of a child, the mother  (that actually doesn't have to be their mother, it's a mother figure and can very well be a man, a sister or whoever is taking care of the child the most) is the person they affectionate the most and is the person their love is going toward. Children don't even know what sex is and obviously Freud is a doctor, he obviously know that and explained what he meant by that. He obviously should have found better words but that isn't very important. Psychoanalysis isn't stupid, in the US the DSM is heavily used as in every part of the world, but IN France for example we use a lot Freud's models in diagnosis, why? Because you usually find the same thing that you will find in the DSM, if you use both you can confirm both of the diagnostics by using the others. I actually like to find the type of attachment because one of them is characteristics to borderline disorders. In any case, Freud is victim of a lot of prejudice on this thread obviously by people who never bothered to read his work. There's a crashcourse on psychology I can't recommand enough, Freud is the most referenced individual in this course for a reason

I also should give an example because some people might notice that you don't actually diagnose someone with psychoanalysis but I'm almost at my stop and I don't know what the topique are translated to in English and in German (we use French here, obviously) so if anyone is interested let me know and I will edit after I find the English translation"
