aww,fe3kn1w,t1_fe2tpfa,1578850172.0,"I absolutely didn't say that all dogs are identical.  I said exactly the opposite: you never know what you're getting.  It's a living animal, not a home protection machine.  

A purchased dog is no more likely to be protective of a home than a shelter dog.  Your ""15 pound dog""  argument is a straw man.   If you're adopting a puppy, you can tell by the paws about how big it'll get, and if you're adopting an adult dog you just look at the dog.

For what it's worth, getting a dog specifically to be a ""home protection system"" is generally a bad idea.  The notion of a dog as some badass attack animal that will tear the throat out of an intruder is a tough guy fantasy, and it's dangerous. It implies that you'll train the dog to be aggressive and that isn't good for being a pet or being around other people or dogs.   If a bad guy's intent is specifically to do you harm, he's probably going to do it with a gun.  He'll have no more compunction about shooting the dog than shooting you.

Dogs discourage burglaries every day, but they don't do it by being bought from a breeder or through aggressiveness training.  Most of the time, they do it by barking.   Barking serves the dual purpose of alerting you if you're home or if you're not, influencing the bad guy to find an easier target.  Most dogs bark, and some even have a big scary imposing bark.  That's the best dog to get for ""home protection."""
aww,fe2s3hv,t1_fe2kvn4,1578842285.0,"He didn't go to a shelter.  He went to a breed-specific rescue.  Those places can be a little snotty and hard to deal with if you don't pass their sniff test.  There still likely are retrievers at the shelters.  They may be on the older side because people want puppies, but older dogs are awesome and need adopted the most.

I understand people are put in bad spots by municipalities or HOAs that say ""no pitbulls."" For me, I'd v say that there's enough variation in dogs described as pitties that I'd tell the banning authority to prove that it's a ""pit bull"" but maybe that wasn't possible/practical here."
aww,fe2r00d,t1_fe2am3e,1578841923.0,"You *never* ""know what you're getting."" It's an animal. The best predictor of how the dog will behave is how you raise it, not how much you pay.

There is lots wrong with buying dogs.  It encourages inbreeding for specific traits (so people ""know what they're getting"" ) which leads to health problems.   It also leads to shelters full of adoptable dogs that either are killed because of lack of resources or that live their lives in a shelter waiting to be adopted.   

Oh, and when those ""purebred"" inbred dogs start having those health issues, guess where the dog shoppers drop them off?  The shelter."
