AskReddit,ffohnek,t1_ffod2jf,1580077679.0,Yup. The simple fact that Stalin didn't persue the matter further is pretty good evidence that he didn't make it out of Berlin. Stalin would have made it an *absolute priority* to follow the trail of rats and find him. Stalin even assisted in tracking down escaped nazis.

But if someone else is obviously driving or they can't identify you as the driver, the ticket is almost immediately thrown out. Speed cams are a revenue generator, so they're relying on people blindly paying the ticket through the mail, not defending themselves in court.

Some states also do not allow you to fight a speeding ticket, even when generated by a camera, so you have to hire a lawyer and escalate, which is more expensive than paying the $190 or whatever, so it kind of just leaves you the option of paying the ticket."

He knew I was into mopeds and mentioned he had one, so I said I was interested. When I saw it was an Indian, I told him it was worth maybe a couple hundred bucks, but I don't buy at market rates, so I offered a hundred because they're still pretty cool little 4 stroke bikes that sound neat. He pulled out his phone and showed me an ebay listing for a Magnum that had an asking price of like $1200, then said ""see, you're getting a deal at $800!"".
