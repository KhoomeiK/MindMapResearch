Like a simple statement before holding the oath of impartiality calling for the senators to be aware that lying about the oath they were about to take was more that just something to brush off. He should have dismissed, McConnell and Graham from the jump off after they went on TV and bragged that they were in ""lock step"" with the white house. That's corruption 101. For the head juror and others to announce they are planning to do whatever the defendant wants including blocking witnesses and new evidence is blatant premeditated bias and a clear case of jurors coordinating with the defendant.

Roberts has also sat like a potted plant with zero comment on the fact that senators are skipping parts of the trial, instead hiding out in the cloak room on their phones or even giving FOX news interviews as the trial is happening. WTF? You get up and walk out because you're bored or simply don't care to listen to the evidence, you get dismissed as a juror. Simple. Instead, Roberts admonished Nadler for speaking the simple truth about the GOP senators' blatant bad faith behaviour, then threw in the white house counsel to make it seem fair, like they're both equally guilty of unparliamentary behaviour. He hauled out the tired excuse that the US Senate is the ""greatest deliberative body in the world"" and they should act like it. Well, the GOP in the senate under McConnell sure the fuck don't act like it. Sad day for the senate, sad day for the supreme court justice's legacy and for the USA.

He also can ignore anything the congress requests even if it's under a legal subpoena. He can refuse to have anyone he feels may be remotely in his orbit from testifying before any committee, sighting ""executive privilege"" over everything and anything. 

Besides the obvious problem this causes for the rule of law in the country in general, in their mad rush to coronate this corrupt President as an untouchable dear leader, the GOP forgot one crucial byproduct of their push to shower the Presidency with more and more unquestioned powers: And that is, that perhaps sooner rather than later, there will be a Democratic President who will then posses these new unchecked powers lavished on the office of the Presidency and the GOP won't have a leg to stand on if they try and complain about anything that new President may do that they don't like.

You would no doubt use a burner phone so as not to be tracked leaving police with only a few options. One is human intel, as in informants passing on info as to your whereabouts or if your are in London, they have CCTV cameras everywhere and can simply input your face into their system and if you should pass by any one of the 4 to 6 million CCTV cameras currently in use in the UK, they can spot you. Problem is as I mentioned, their facial recognition trial failed 80% of the time."
