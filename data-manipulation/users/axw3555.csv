AskReddit,ff8w6oe,t1_ff8l9it,1579698112.0,"I think this is often the thing - people think that social anxiety and introverted behaviour are the same thing, when they’re really different. (Source: am a major introvert and suffered hugely from social anxiety in my teens/early 20’s).

Social anxiety is largely fear based - you don’t speak in case you say the wrong thing. 

Introversion is often just finding people tiring. An introvert can behave exactly the same as an extravert, be big, loud, outgoing, etc. But where something like that would leave a true extravert kind of exhilarated at the end of the night, it would leave an introvert drained - they need time to themselves to process and recover.

Put me at a game expo or tournament, I look extraverted - I’m loud, opinionated, driving for things to happen. But afterwards, I need time, often a lot of it, to recover. I went to a MtG tournament in London a few years ago - literally thousands of people, I was in the middle talking to random people I’d never seen before or since. The event was Friday - Sunday. Stayed in a hotel, had a great time. Then needed Monday and Tuesday to recover. My mate, who is a genuine extravert was fine and went to another game tournament on Monday evening."

£154.40 per year for colour, £52 for black and white. That’s for a household. As to what it looks like, it’s not like a driving licence, it’s just a payment.

Yes, most people do. In 2018, there were about 29 million paid TV licences. When you consider that, it means that well over 90% of people are covered.

No it doesn’t come with the TV as you only have to pay if you watch live tv or the iPlayer. So if you’re just using a smart tv to watch Netflix or amazon, you don’t have to have one.

Yes people get fined. It’s not completely draconian, but it happens. It’s also worth noting that it’s a maximum of 1k, it can be less.

And no, the politicians don’t get rid of it because it’s not something most people are against. It’s the primary funding source for the BBC, and people in the U.K. value that, and so are most are willing to pay 42p a day for it. Some people don’t like it and don’t pay it.

explainlikeimfive,fems8j9,t1_femm7sp,1579268131.0,"A big part of it is “the dose makes the poison”.

You put it into your eyes. If some does make it into your sinus or whatever, it’s going to be a trace amount. A drop is a fraction of a millilitre, and your getting a fraction of that in your sinus. And of that, only a fraction would make it into your stomach as it would just be a trickle, which would get less and less as it moved (think a drop of rain on a window).

At that dose, it won’t have any material effect on your body. 

If you add it to food or drink, it’ll be taken straight to the stomach and into the intestine. Your intestine is designed to absorb stuff. So you’d get a lot of the drug absorbed. 

And someone maliciously poisoning their spouse isn’t going to use one or two drops, they’ll probably empty a 15ml bottle into their food. So instead of a trace, they’ll get a lot of it into their bloodstream.


As further to the “how can it be bad one way but not another” and the dose issue - take the favourite of antivaxxers a- formaldehyde.

Formaldehyde is a pretty nasty chemical we use in embalming. People freak out when they hear it’s in something like a vaccine or cigarette.

Except that it’s also found in apples. Because it’s a natural byproduct of life. In fact an apple has much more than anything like a vaccine. In those doses, no one cares. But drink it and suddenly you’re in a world of bad.

And literally anything is poison in the right circumstances. Drink more water than your kidneys can purge for too long, and you’re suffering water poisoning. Or mix two different medicines and they can turn bad - I was on a tablet to protect my stomach lining a few years ago. That was all it did - protect it from other tablets I was taking.
