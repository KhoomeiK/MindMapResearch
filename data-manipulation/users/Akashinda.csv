You could probably find a job to pay your own food to not be a drag to their family. If you never done work before, it's not as draining as you might think it is, and better than to lay in a blood puddle because you're sub human brother wants his next fix."

For so long I kept hearing ""There are people worse off"" and I can't fucking answer that, it's like saying to a man who lost an arm, ""Well this one lost ONE arm AND a leg so you shouldn't complain"" 

This world is depressing because to be socisl with someone both need to be interesting for each other, no one helps lonely people because we don't bring them anything."
