TEFL,ffgw9kp,t3_ethwqp,1579916669.0,"I want to put this out there for first time EAL teachers: the stress of the international move combined with the exposure to new viruses is terrible **in an ideal situation**. My first overseas move I was so incredibly sick from a regular cold that I ended up with a complex secondary eye infection. 

This is *not* an ideal situation."
keto,ffgnxbt,t1_ffgnelw,1579910658.0,You should *not* bring outside food into a restaurant. I worked in food and beverage for years and was trained in food safety.
keto,ffgmpym,t1_ffdrijv,1579909826.0,"No, don't bring your own food to a restaurant. For goodness'sakes."
keto,ffgmj6b,t3_etbe18,1579909699.0,Does she drink diet soda or use sweeteners? I know they're generally lauded as safe but for me personally they make me have similar symptoms.
keto,ffgmdv5,t3_et95qm,1579909600.0,Flour is fine. I use flour for gravy. It's so spread out over the servings that it's not going to make or break a meal.
keto,ffgm5mq,t3_etd0wf,1579909445.0,"I have plain dark chocolate. I don't sweat the whole ""no, you MUST BREAK THE DESSERT HABIT""  absolutism, because for me I can have one piece and be fine. I'm pretty relaxed about my approach to keto and I'm not overweight, so for me it's more a happy little treat. That approach may work better for you."

science,ffg2a1y,t1_fffiy3p,1579896905.0,There's definitely not. I learned Mandarin at 26. It was fine. It just takes 6-10 years for ANYONE to get to academic level in ANY language so it seems longer when you're looking at an adult.
CanadianTeachers,ffesxse,t3_et5ksc,1579864024.0,"I'm 33 and finished my elementary degree last year. Do you speak French or are you willing go move rural? If not, let me be totally clear, because people often aren't: you will supply teach for years in most areas and you will likely not break $20,000 a year supply teaching. Be fully cognizant of the economic realities for new teachers.

There is a positivity culture that will have most people vehemently denying how low the pay is, but do the calculations yourself or go off of local union numbers. In my district people claimed you'd make around $40,000 or more. When I looked at the real union numbers fewer than 4% of supply teachers make more than 19,000. We have a high need for supplies and a shortage of supplies many days. We also have a teacher shortage. We still do not actually have full-time contracts for new teachers. Know your area and know your finances!

That being said, I love teaching. I'm just moving to do it, and as someone with a husband, a dog, and an established life, I think it's important for older teachers like us to know that!"
CanadianTeachers,fferhui,t3_et7kpt,1579861936.0,Go to UNB over STU if you're thinking NB. Send me a message if you want details.

CanadianTeachers,fey3qjv,t1_fewi0yp,1579440415.0,"You should do some research into it. It's much better developed than the Canadian curriculums, in my opinion."
CanadianTeachers,few53jj,t3_eqr8m4,1579405513.0,"""why don't we just use NGSS because it's infinitely better""?"
pianoteachers,feuynql,t1_feuxisu,1579391241.0,"I had an okayish teacher, but her primary instrument was vocals so she used the RCM as a framework for me and we were very exam focused. I did well on the exams and did a lot of technical work, but had limited understanding of my rote memorization. I'm basically rebuilding everything! It's fun."
pianoteachers,feurbk6,t3_eqj2sa,1579389220.0,I was RCM grade 9 completed when i stopped. I didn't play for 6-7 years. I obviously retained all my theory but my technique was awful. I started in again with grade 7 and quickly developed RSI. I went back to grade 1 and after two years am at a comfort grade 4/5.
Honduras,feuoyq4,t1_feuoity,1579388648.0,Right. I just don't think I can be brave enough to move there. I'm a little too anxious!
CanadianTeachers,femjwy5,t1_fekokxr,1579259343.0,People *cannot* make a good living as supplies. We need to stop perpetuating this myth. It's less than $20000 a year after taxes in Canada. You need a second job through the year and a summer job when the school year is out.
Honduras,feeps0a,t1_fedg971,1579038650.0,That's the school! I'm going to message you!

teaching,fdv7p7q,t3_en3j72,1578744331.0,"Try lesson planning in batches. For example, if you're elementary, do a week or two of Math and Literacy lessons so you can structure in some repetition of core concepts or build to a larger project."
Teachers,fdi7h9o,t1_fdhpy8p,1578437100.0,I'm absolutely on this train! I judge myself so hard.
