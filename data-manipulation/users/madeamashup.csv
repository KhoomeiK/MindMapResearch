Your morning coffee shop line may move a bit quicker but the coffee shop has the payment system as one of their major budget items. My friends just opened a cafe and they said choosing a payment system was a bigger headache than sourcing their ingredients. Those costs are deliberately hidden from you as the consumer by the terms of the POS agreement, but you better believe you're the one paying them. In fact you still pay them if you use cash in the shop because they're bound by an agreement that prohibits them from offering a discount for cash sales which are less expensive for the store. In effect, cash purchases are inflated to help subsidize the credit company.

This particular cafe is crushing their competition a block away, because the competition decided to go cash-only to keep costs lower. I only know of one local business that's cashless and it's like an organic dog bakery or something, so who cares?"

todayilearned,ff0o0fd,t1_ff09qcn,1579470638.0,"A really interesting movie adapdation that nobody saw of a book nobody read was the novel *Pontypool changes everything*. During the height of zombie hysteria circa 2009-ish, this excellent book was mostly lost in the noise of garbage like *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*.

The novel is about a zombie outbreak that starts in Pontypool, a small town in Ontario, and spreads to Toronto. It was a really interesting, novel, and genuinely horrifying take on the zombie genre that I highly recommend. Then it was made into a low-budget film just called *Pontypool*.

The film is constrained almost entirely within an underground radio station in Pontypool. Consequently, there are very few zombies in the film and most of the horror is uncovered by telephone calls from the outside world, which actually suits the nature of this particular zombie contagion perfectly. Where the novel was graphic and violent, the movie is tense and indirect. To do this they had to change basically every aspect of the plot except the notion of generally what was happening. The main protagonist was changed from a hotshot Toronto TV reporter into a washed up radio DJ, and most of the secondary characters from the novel were eliminated. It basically was an entirely different story about a similar type of virus, but somehow seemed entirely true to the original."
