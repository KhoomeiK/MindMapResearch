todayilearned,ff595yp,t1_ff3ty18,1579583986.0,Aleksandr Karelin for wrestling. His record is 887-2. Both losses were by a single point.
todayilearned,ff58ew3,t1_ff50vsz,1579583296.0,"Well, the average NHL game featured 7.77 goals per game in 84-85. Out of the 6530 goals scored that year, Gretzky had points on 208 of them (3.2%!). Exlcuding Gretzky's totals the goals per game went down to 7.53, and that's full NHL. Now, you could argue that goals would still happen if Gretzky was average. So, lets take his point total down by 100 points (into a measly 6th place with 108, although two of his teammates above him would likely fall too), and take those 100 points out of the equation but leave in the 108, it still falls to 7.65 goals per game. Meaning one in every ten games had one less goal if gretzky was still amazing, despite him only playing in 1 out of every 10.5.

In other words, the 1983-84 season featured Wayne Gretzky putting up 205 points, the second time the 200 point mark was reached (he was first). He fell 26 points short of the New Jersey Devils team, which managed to only get 231 goals that year."
