AskReddit,fev7xve,t1_feuc3qo,1579394265.0,"It's very much in the So Bad It's Bad territory. I feel that people are exaggerating the horrific aspects, but when I went to see it, it was just *painfully* boring and awkward. Nothing about it was enjoyable at all. Every five minutes I asked myself what I was doing sitting there when I could be doing literally anything more enjoyable than this movie."
AskReddit,fev78rs,t1_feu9zmo,1579393960.0,"It's pretty awful. I feel a lot of the horror is exaggerated, but it's *very much* a terrible movie. I went to see it just to see if it was in So Bad It's Good territory. Ended up walking out halfway through. There's literally nothing to enjoy about this movie unless you just get really turned on by creepily realistic anthro cats."

todayilearned,fei4v8c,t1_fehhv1b,1579130328.0,Possibly. Ships were made of wood back then and a steam engine is basically one big fire. I can imagine a lot of people being apprehensive about that.

""I'm sorry to bother""
""A moment of your time""
""I'm sorry for the trouble""

When you're nice to people who have to deal with you as part of their job they'll go way the hell out of their own way to help you."

explainlikeimfive,fdy0ha6,t1_fdxwete,1578774752.0,"That kind of got retconned in DBS. Frieza (Freeza?) gets resurrected after maybe a decade of being dead. Though maybe he was just special.

EDIT
I just looked it up to be sure, and apparently you *can* resurrect someone who has been dead for more than a year, but you can't do large quantities of people who have been dead for more than a year. So they could theoretically revive one person at a time every year."
gaming,fdpu62z,t1_fdprpsh,1578640615.0,"KotOR 2 is a good game despite it's massive flaws. The devs were given a large budget and lots of time and committed to a big project because of it, then publisher Lucas Arts pulled the rug out from under them and demanded a shorter time frame to release after the groundwork for a larger game had already been laid down.

As a matter of fact, the fan patch uses and polishes a lot of content that's *still in the game files*, but that couldn't be used because there wasn't enough time to finish it all. IIRC the devs had a patch that could have activated that content shortly after release but were forbidden from doing so because the X Box version of the game wouldn't be able to receive it."

todayilearned,fcm9tgz,t1_fclq1qc,1577768143.0,"I sat on a jury trial for a dude that went through a similar scenario, except instead of dying it paralyzed him from the waist down for the rest of his life. Dude had a tumor in his spine that popped up on a scan he got for something else, as bright and glaring as the fucking *sun*, and the person reviewing the results missed it completely. Sometime later he was playing with his grand kids and the vertebrae the tumor was inside shattered like a glass egg.

He's gonna die in a wheelchair but he ended up with a pile of cash.

*edit*
A word or three."
history,fbtm6wh,t1_fbsebyl,1577084444.0,"CK2 is pretty good, but Paradox's DLC policy might turn people away. They like to keep developing their games for a *long* time after initial release and fund it by releasing loads of expansion pack style DLC. There's something like *fifteen* full expansion packs and a bunch of other cosmetic stuff.

Good news, though, if you would consider it such. CK3 is in development and to get more people playing their games Paradox has made the CK2 base game free for anyone who wants to try it out. Download that and give it a spin if you think you might like the game."
