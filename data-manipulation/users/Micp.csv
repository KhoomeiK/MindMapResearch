You had to put rich into that sentence. If it wasn't there your argument would fall apart. That's my entire point. The operating word here is rich, not white.

freefolk,fdlj6wb,t1_fdlfpsx,1578525198.0,"So a couple of problems i find with your comment.

The first one is that you treat your ""switches"" as static, whereas in reality the hierarchy of the importance of the switches is very much dependant on the situation you're in. Because you're right: in a case of a police stop skin color is indeed the most important ""switch"".

The second one is that if we are to talk about an ""in general"" hierarchy of switches that you put the race switch first in the hierarchy. While i will agree that it is important, socioeconomic status is the most important predictor of future success. If you want to talk about access to access the benefits of society socioeconomic status should therefore be the first switch in line.

Now of course there is a racial disparity in that black people more often have a low socioeconomic status, but that doesn't change the fact that a black, high SES kid will have an easier time ""accessing the benefits of society"" than a white low SES kid. Ben Carsons kid is definitely enjoying the benefits of society a good deal more than jimmy from the trailer park.

What i think most people are objecting to here is a notion that the two privileges are equally important to this case, when it seems fairly obvious that their wealth and connections carries so much more weight here.

As for intersectionality the jury is still out on whether that actually serves to unite or divide people. Don't get me wrong the underlying idea is solid, but the way that it's often carried out is too divisive, shutting people out of the discussion for not having enough ""oppression labels"".

If we are to move forward we can't ignore various struggles, no, but we also need to have a realistic scale of their importance in individual cases.

harrypotter,fdda37h,t3_ekfawk,1578301968.0,"So I enjoy redemption arcs. There's almost nothing more powerful than a character than finally shows himself being properly redeemed. But i also kinda enjoy that JK didn't go that route with Malfoy. He showed doubts and regrets up to the killing of Dumbledore, but that alone does not a redemption make. And i kinda appreciate the message that some people won't be fully moustache twirling evil or knight in shining armor good. Malfoy is not a good guy. He's never really showed any such inclinations. Be he's also not the moustache twirling evil that Harry often imagined him to be. He's just a kinda weakwilled dipshit who grew up as a spoiled brat.

But that said i of course agree that the Slytherin house as a whole could've been written better, although we should remember that the books are told from Harry's point of view, and the dude was a little... simplistic in his view of the world. But yeah, some Slytherins should've fought in the battle of Hogwarts. It doesn't really seem realistic otherwise."

MensLib,fcj7anp,t1_fcj6dke,1577679048.0,"I've already posted a lot in this thread so I'm feeling like I'm repeating myself, so I'll probably stop posting.

But to sum it up it's my impression that there are two general stances in this thread. 

One is something like ""people should be portrayed as who they are. It's not okay to change the portryal of a gay man to a straight man or vice versa. That's equal treatment.""

The other one is something like ""It's okay to change the portrayal of a straight man to a gay man because it's in the interest of helping a marginalized group"".

To me both sides have good intentions, but the premise of the two stances are just incompatible so we'll never reach an agreement on this.

Either way i just want to ensure that despite having been accused of being a homophobe several times in this thread, I am for gay rights, I agree with the point the artist is trying to get across, i just disagree with the way that he is doing it. That's all. I don't really think i can add more to this conversation that i haven't already written in a comment here."
MensLib,fcj5lu5,t1_fcj4bo8,1577677843.0,I too believe in the multiple masculinity spectrum. There's nothing wrong with being a non-traditional man. I do however think there's something wrong with deliberately portraying a man as something he's not. I dissaproved of the Chinese edit of Bohemian Rhapsody that left out Freddy Mercurys homosexuality. Similarly i dissaprove of this. That only seems logically consistent to me.
MensLib,fcixnh5,t1_fcitp3x,1577672281.0,"I mean the long and short of it is just that it's not okay to sexualize female heroes. And equally not okay to sexualize male heroes.

But even then if we go further into your argument, it's not exactly the same is it? Like you could argue that Zapata WAS sexualized when he was potrayed as a hyper macho hero, he was just sexualized as a very masculine man, ie. corresponding to how he would like to present himself. But this on the other hand presents him very much in a different way from how he would want to present himself.

Either way, i don't really see a point in going too far into this. It's wrong to sexually female heroes, it's also wrong to sexualize male heroes. That's really all there is to it."
MensLib,fcituo9,t1_fcisix9,1577669676.0,"> except that he WAS a heavily political figure 

Sure, but being political doesn't mean that you are relevant in all political cases. You say it yourself: His deal was with fair redistribution of land. So if you use him in the things that he actually had an opinion of that we know, then by all means use him. Capitalism vs. socialism? Sure. Workers rights and exploitation by corporations? Absolutely.

But to my knowledge he never said anything about gay rights, and i wouldn't be too surprised if it turned out he was actually a homophobe. It's a completely different venue.

> You can’t have “queer-NORMALIZATION” if queer IS NOT THE NORM. lol. 

Now i just think you're willfully misreading my comment. The context of it was that heteronormalization had just been used to imply portraying queer people as straight. So i reversed it to queernormalization to indicate portraying straight people as queer. That's just basic reading comprehension.

I think I have made it fairly clear in my comments that I'm all for supporting the marginalized, be it gay, trans, black, women or whatever else you can think of. I just think there are good ways and bad ways of doing so and that this isn't a great way to do it. I likewise think it says a lot about you that you seem to think that any kind of criticism of someones methods means that you're against their goals.

Take your strawmen elsewhere."
MensLib,fciq0cd,t1_fciogte,1577667082.0,"You're asking questions i think I already answered in my last comment, but i guess i can clarify. 

The pope is part of an organisation that is actively harming homosexuals today. As thus he has already implicated himself in this political debate and is fair game, and would continue to be so even after he died.

The difference between the pope and Zapata in this case is that Zapata has not implicated himself in this debate, so implicating him after he's dead and can't have a say isn't fair to him. He could be all for gay rights. He could be a disgusting homophobe. We don't know, so let's not get him implicated in a debate we don't know what he'd feel about.

> others SHOULD be free to portray him as they see fit so as to make a point. 

Yes we already covered the free speech thing. But we're back to the point that there's a difference between what should be legally allowed to say and what is okay to say. Legally people were allowed to keep track of whether or not Marykate and Ashley Olsen as well as Lindsay Lohan were 18 yet, and make websites about it. It's still creepy and they shouldn't do it, regardless of the legality of it.

> It’s obvious people have a problem when a man is put in heels. 

Sure, but there are better ways of adressing it. Freddy Mercury did it nicely with I Want to Break Free. Plenty of drag queens are doing it today. But they aren't dragging other people into it, they are taking it upon themselves.

> I was trying to show you that Herero-normalization is an actual behavior by institutions and people in power to harm through erasure and censorship of queer people. 

Sure and i have already said that i agree that is bad and shouldn't be done. I just happen to keep it consistent and think it shouldn't be done the other way too. As I'm trying to say, two wrongs don't make a right. Portray people honestly as who they are/were, regardless of whether they are gay or straight."
