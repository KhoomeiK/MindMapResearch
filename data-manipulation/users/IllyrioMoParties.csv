Yes, I know: a lord's dungeon *near* Gulltown, but if it's Runestone as you suggest (a good catch) then that's good cover: Littlefinger gets his spy in thru Gulltown and turns him loose near Runestone to commit crimes in the jurisdiction of a man known to send people to the Wall. That's a little bit of cover: if anybody asks, it's not a Littlefinger ally who sent them, so the report back to Varys from Varys's spies might not rumble them.

(And I believe Varys must already have a spy at the Wall by now. People speculate Yoren to be one, and Conwy has Yoren's same job - hey, maybe they *were* Varys's spies, and Yoren was supposed to pick them up on his way north, but was rushing straight to Riverrun/Winterfell instead.)

Well, I'm glad of that, although you are still missing the point of that story - but you're so close to the point anyway, and I've already explained it once, so, as you say, whatever.

Your re-envisioning of the parable: I take your point, but the analogy is inapt. We are not animal experts conducting a detailed study of an animal; we are readers of a work of fiction. Yes, we're both making suppositions based on incomplete information, and some of us may flatter ourselves to be experts, but the inventor of the animal, such as he is, is not actively trying to trick the animal experts: to continue your metaphor, God did not design an elephant with wings coming out of his arse just to surprise these blind men.

(And it occurs that your metaphor is even wronger than that, because of course what you're describing is essentially paleontology, and the best experts in that field reckoned dinosaurs didn't have feathers, until it turned out they did.)

You assert that it's bad writing for a twist to arrive that wasn't set up by now, and I agree. But all the good theories are arguing exactly that - that the twists have been set up, just cunningly enough so that we don't notice it.

This is as it should be: the twist must be surprising, or it isn't a twist; but the groundwork should've been properly laid, or it's a deus ex machina.

Where you're going wrong is ""reasonable boundaries"": in thinking you know what they are. But if GRRM's writing is working as intended, then you won't.

And that explanation never quite made sense anyway, because if your son was shaming you and was therefore manifestly unfit for the lordship, why would you abdicate and give him all that power?

That said, I do think Jorah's bad behaviour started early:

> ...the island suited me well enough, and I never lacked for women. I had my share of fishwives and crofter's daughters, before and after I was wed [the first time, i.e. when he was young].

One wonders exactly how these wives and daughters felt about this - and does not need to wonder how their husbands and fathers felt. Sounds like he was practicing the right of first night, and before he was even lord, too.

I also would like to point out the singular unlikeliness of slave traders just happening by Bear Island. Look at a map, and consider the slave trader as, well, a trader:

> *""Okay, boys, you know that continent where they forbid slavery? Well, what we're gonna do, we're gonna sail all the way around the bottom of it, all the way up the west coast until we hit frozen tundra, and see if there's any slaves for sale. It'll take months, and eat up a whole ship's worth of food several times over. Not to mention you'll all want your wages paying at the end of it. But I am confident we will find enough slaves to make it worth our while!"" [crew mutinies]

*Maybe* if this guy was a general trader, not just slaves - but prety much the only traders in operation on the west coast are people who always work that route, and so (a) where are they gonna sell these two slaves, (b) ain't they worried, being subject to Westeros's anti-slavery laws, that they'll get caught and killed too, and (c) is two slaves really worth all that risk?

The story's fishy as hell if you ask me, and coupled with all this fuzziness on the timeline... I think a lot of the fuzziness comes from Mance telling Jon deliberate lies to see if Jon picks up on it, but still: there's something weird going on with Bear Island.

No, it's about different people with incomplete information. That's why they're blind men. Which is my point: the elephant story would make the same point if it were just one blind man feeling the trunk and saying ""an elephant is like a snake"".

The reason there's *three* men is so that their mutually incompatible ignorance, when combined with basic human nature, can lead to them arguing, even fighting: thus it's a parable about more than merely the misleading nature of ignorance but about how that ignorance leads inevitably to conflict.

Personally, I think this is *hugely* thematically relevant to ASOIAF (see below) but I may well be wrong; it may be irrelevant, or it may only be slightly relevant. I need the full picture - the whole elephant, as it were - to be sure.

> Either way the book is about the American dream, justice in America, and social paradigms.

Yes, but *what it specifically is saying* about those things is hugely determined by how the novel ends.

It's easy to read these novels and say ""it's about war and power and stuff"", but it's also vague and pointless.

On top of that, *if* the story is being told in a certain way, it might be semi-concealing that the story, whilst being concerned with war and power and stuff, is more concerned with identity and ignorance and perspective. ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" might be hugely important thematically - and its impact will be greatly enhanced if it turns out that we the readers ""knew nothing"" too - and that gut-punch can only happen via extraordinarily unexpected twists. All of which would make practical sense of the nature of the novels - their size, their shaky intrahistorical foundation, the POV structure - all of which is to say that good theories are consonant with what little of the themes of the novels can be discerned at this point.

But because some people already have their minds made up about what these books are about and where they're going - because ""it is known"" - they insist on dismissing anything that doesn't fit their preconceptions as ""tinfoil"".

You could argue he was parachuted in as Lord Commander because he was such an experienced leader - an actual lord! - but such men ain't that rare in the Watch, and even Brynden Rivers, one of the most experienced leaders ever to grace the Wall, took six years to work his way up the ladder.

Hmm...

I once did a little work on the timeline around Jeor's joining the Night's Watch, I might add it to the OP or something

Or maybe just add it here, see what you think:

> ""...the island suited me well enough, and I never lacked for women. I had my share of fishwives and crofter's daughters, before and after I was wed. I married young, to a bride of my father's choosing, a Glover of Deepwood Motte. Ten years we were wed, or near enough as makes no matter. She was a plain-faced woman, but not unkind. I suppose I came to love her after a fashion, though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate. Three times she miscarried while trying to give me an heir. The last time she never recovered. She died not long after.""

-- *ACOK*, Daenerys I

Lots to unpack there, but sticking to the timeline as pertains to Jeor: Jeor is still Lord of Bear Island when Jorah is ""young"", arranging Jorah's marriage; he joins the Watch at some point in the next ten or so years.

[The wiki says](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Years_after_Aegon%27s_Conquest/Calculations_Ages_(Continued)#Jorah_Mormont) at Jorah's first wedding he's 25. But is that ""marrying young"" in Westeros? Hardly. The wiki is making an assumption that there was little-to-no time lag between Jorah's first wife dying and his second marriage, which puts Jorah's first wedding at around 279-ish. This means Jeor takes the black very soon after the marriage, and rises through the ranks extremely quickly in order to be Lord Commander when Alliser Thorne shows up. We can fudge this by having Thorne's trip to the Wall delayed for some reason - perhaps he didn't get there til 284 or even 285, languishing in Lannister jail or whatever. But there's no indication of that, and it's still a tight fit.

I propose that there was a long time between the end of Jorah's first marriage and the start of his second one (in 289 or 290). It's right there in his quote above:

> ""...the island suited me well enough, and I never lacked for women. I had my share of fishwives and crofter's daughters, before and after I was wed.""

Why buy a cow when you're getting free milk from every cow on the island? Especially if you're lord, and there's no-one to force you.

What's ""marrying young"" in Westeros? 15? Younger? The wiki has good reason to put Jorah's birthdate around 254, so if we take an arbitrary marriage age range of 12-20, we get wedding dates of 266-274, which potentially puts Jeor's joining of the Watch as early at the late 260's.

That sounds too early, but isn't actually out of the bounds of possibility, and makes the early-to-mid 270's all the more plausible, making it all the more difficult that Jeor Mormont is out and about meeting Pycelle, Stannis, and Selmy - *unless he's the Night's Watch's recruiter in the 270's*, in which case he has a reason to be travelling all around Westeros chatting up all these people. (And maybe they'd be more inclined to support the Watch if the Watch's pitchman was a nobleman.)

Lord of Bear Island has no (known) reason to be corresponding with the Grand Maester. Yes, Pycelle tends the ravens; yes, letters to King's Landing go through him; but that is not the same as Mormont writing directly to Pycelle, and Bear Island is a long way away and totally unimportant: hardly any need to write to King's Landing directly, totally unknown why he'd be corresponding personally with Pycelle. (And bear in mind that Mormont's contact with King's Landing should, properly, go through Winterfell.)

> This is actually proof of a pretty big misconception that a lot of people have. These Lords and Ladies and other nobles actually travelled around a hell of a lot, especially in their youth. Brandon Stark is a great example of this as he is said to have travelled round the Riverlands and the Vale quite a bit.

Some of them travelled a lot, some of them didn't. It depended on the lord, and in many cases it took a good reason to get them travelling - a tourney, a wedding, a war. Recall AGOT when Ned/Catelyn go south: they bump into many people they haven't seen in ten or twenty years, and we're talking about friends and family.

Northmen are especially characterised as being unwilling to travel, I forget the quote. It might be specific to some northmen to be fair. But Brandon is atypical in many regards - ""wild"" - and Rickard's other kids being fostered out/married off to southroners was again highly atypical. Travel in and around the north would be relatively normal, but further afield, less normal.

And even *if* Mormont travelled, that still doesn't explain how he befriended these particular men.

> It is entirely possible that Mormont fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings which would have involved getting to know a lot of the Southern Nobility. Furthermore, its a given that whenever Rickard Stark travelled down South he would have brought a large retinue which would have included some of his bannermen. Ergo Mormont could have met many Southern Lords.

Yep, fair enough.

> Stannis is a bit more difficult but its likely that Mormont is basing a lot of this stuff on his perception of them. He hears about the reputation of Stannis Baratheon and believes that he can be reasoned with.

No, he says he knew Stannis in his (Mormont's) youth, which is impossible unless we're talking when Stannis was a child.

> Also it should be stated that the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch is a pretty prestigious position.

No, it isn't, ref. Tyrion's chapters and the chapters set in King's Landing. The Night's Watch is a joke to a great many people.

But still, you're right:

> In a time of peace (i.e. not in the time of the books) the LC would probably open communications with many of the important people of the realm (LPs, Small Council members, etc) just to build some of those relationships that are vital for someone of his position. This is actually pretty important as the LC can be anyone and so its likely that new LCs don't have existing relationships with the top people in the realm.

This is all correct, but Mormont's tenure as LC is not ""his youth"" and anyway writing a few letters ain't getting to know them."

Although we don't actually have much confirmation of northern involvement - no mention of Rickard Stark, for instance - but Willam Dustin's great-uncle was apparently there, so, if he was a northman, that's some northmen fighting with Barristan in 260, when Jeor was 30, i.e. his youth from the perspective of a 70-yr old man.

Finally, a good answer! Top one

Rickard Stark did visit King's Landing 5 years later, so maybe Jeor distinguished himself in 259, befriended Barristan, and was therefore a part of Rickard's retinue in 264, where he might've met Pycelle.

But there's a problem: Barristan spends time in the presence of Jorah Mormont, and specifically calls him out as a traitor and a weasel... and doesn't mention, at that moment, that he's friends with Jorah's father? There's no ""I knew your father, ser, and he would be ashamed to see you what you've become"" or some shit like that.

He might, but that's not ""in his youth"" unless he joined the Night's Watch much earlier than is commonly assumed; and anyway, we have no evidence of a personal relationship of any kind between Aemon and Pycelle, so Mormont's ""knowing"" Pycelle would be restricted to whatever mention was made of him in Aemon's letters, which, given how little of a shit the Citadel appears to give about the Wall, might well have been few and far between. But hey, maybe Pycelle liked the sound of this Mormont chap and they became pen pals.

> ...while Barristan is only a couple years younger than him and was a tourney knight so it's possible they might have crossed paths that way.

Except we have no evidence that Jeor took an interest on tourneys or travelled anywhere except Bear Island and the Wall.

Not trying to piss on your chips, I'm just saying, either Jeor is not accurate/truthful here or there's a whole other interesting chapter to his life we don't know about: but based on what we know, there's no reasonable explanation for his having a personal relationship with these men, and yet that's what he claims."
