Marriage,fffdmdi,t1_fff3mdm,1579881641.0,"I usually don't say this, but for the sake of your kids you have to leave her man. As long as you stay with a woman who abuses your kids, they will think that how they are treated is acceptable to you. You accept that she does the same thing over and over again without regret, and that is what your kids pick up on. She's not their mother, she's just a lady you happen to like. 

Even if she does go to therapy and gradually get better (there's no guarantee that she will get better, she has to actually genuinely want to improve in order for this to happen, and it doesn't seem like she's at all ready for that from what you describe) your kids will still have to put up with her abuse while she ""recovers"", if she ever does. You are also not there 100% of the time, which means she can do a lot of damage when you're not around to step in.

If a divorce is not possible, at least separate from her so your kids don't have to live with her or see her any more."
Marriage,ffevenz,t1_ffe4fyb,1579867197.0,I'd take the child away from her the exact moment she did this. Should the child have to put up with abuse because there is a deadline on when it's supposed to end? The child didn't choose to be in the marriage.

fatlogic,ffcryn0,t1_ffchql7,1579806033.0,"I mean if you're not challenged by it then it's nothing more than light stretching. 

Of course it can be exercise if it actually challenges you."

Edit to clarify: of course yoga can be challenging and an exercise, for many people it is, but if you don't push yourself when it gets a bit tough it is pretty much light stretching. I regularly do it myself and enjoy it a lot, it can build strength and flexibility if you allow it to and if you push to develop your skills, but you can also do the corpse pose for 45min and call it yoga.

Intense, or a better word may be challenging, is also very subjective. If you find it a challenge then it will build your strength, flexibility, endurance or all three, and in that case it is exercise for sure. I personally don't consider walking up a flight of stairs exercise, for me it's a way of getting to the next floor, but for someone who weighs 500lbs or who has a muscle/pain disorder/any sickness or disorder that has left them super weak, then walking up a flight of stairs can very well be super taxing and definitely exercise, for some it may even be a feat they have to work on and reaching that milestone may even be cause for celebration. When I say intense then I mean intense for you, or challenging for you. Just to clear that up.

End of edit.

Okay I actually agree with the sentiment of the person in the FA-post. However, yoga that isn't intense is just light stretching at best, that's not exercise. 

I'm a big proponent of just taking your 10-20k steps/day, or the equivalent in dancing, or biking, or playing excergames, or swimming, or doing anything low impct that gets your heart rate up a bit for around 1h-90min/day. This really should be the bulk of your health routine because it's the one you'll be able to sustain almost no matter what you're going through. Running 5k, or going to the gym, or doing some other higher impact exercise is great to do on top of that some 2-3 times a week, but it isn't what you should rely on for weight loss and over all health. Lower impact means lower risk of injuries too.

If you take a 1-1.5 hour walk a day in a pace that elevates your heart rate but doesn't feel unsustainable or even challenging, and are over all active you're living an over all healthier life than someone who is a couch potato but goes to the gym 3 hours/week."
fatlogic,ffbmotr,t3_esojil,1579773005.0,"Well, you're more likely to stick with simple changes and switches than if you change every single habit all at once. One consistently okay year beats one perfect day or week.

I tried on American shirts and S was like a tent, XS fit, but wasn't exactly form fitting. XS was the smallest size. I'm not the biggest dude, 5'7 and ~150lbs, but an XS should not fit me, there are plenty of guys smaller than me and the average person where I'm from is ~2in taller than the average American, so that's not the reason the sizes are bigger..."

fatlogic,fex0vu8,t1_fewv13l,1579422509.0,"I was also extremely afraid of dogs as a kid. If I met one on a leash in the street I'd cross the street to not walk on the same side as it, but I love them now. I also started out tolerating small dogs that friends had, then I met some nice goldens/labradors that were just super patient and calm. 

I was also severely hypochondriac for a period of my life (like 5-10 panic attacs/day level anxiety), and what helped me to actually get better was to do everything I started feeling like I wanted to avoid, and to realize that the anxiety was completely irrational. 

The best thing you can do to cure phobias are to face them head on in a controlled manner, ignoring them and doing your very best to avoid what you're afraid of will just make the issue worse. There's a reason CBT works so well for phobias and certain anxiety disorders.

If you have well regulated T1 diabetes you are 2 times more likely than the average person to die prematurely.

If you have poorly regulated T1 diabetes you are 8-10 times as likely to die prematurely. 

How easy your diabetes is to regulate doesn't necessarily have to do with how well you look after it, stress, hormones, and unknown life variables can cause the diabetes to be poorly regulated for extended periods. How well regulated it has been previously in your life also affects the risk."

Hermaphrodite are species that reproduce/have the ability to reproduce as both sexes as a standard, intersex is any variation in hormones/genital configuration/sex chromosomes that are not standard to humans. Intersex people usually have one (if any) functioning sex organs and therefore don't reproduce, nor have the ability to do so, as both male and female.

The medical community and biologists separated the two decades ago because it lead to a lot of confusion. The word hermaphrodite used on an intersex person is therefore, by definition, dehumanizing."
