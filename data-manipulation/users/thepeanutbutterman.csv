aww,fefgp4j,t1_feffk6d,1579055950.0,"Lol, you do realize that phrase is usually followed up with a counterpoint. 

Dog fighting was a massively popular, sanctioned sport in late-18th and early-19th century America. it was promoted by very reputable organizations and was part of American culture. Sorry if these facts upset you or if you dont understand what the word ""legitimate"" means."
aww,fef55xi,t1_fef48ji,1579048426.0,"I've also worked with pit rescues for over 20 years and it's much less common to use a bait dog than one would be led to believe. Like I said, there are sadistic assholes that will engage in all kinds of terrible behavior. However, when the media and others are quick to conclude that a dog is a bait dog without having seen how the injuries occurred, it can actually more damage because it encourages copycat assholes. 

I'm not doubting what happened to your beautiful dog, I just try to point out that it's less common than people might believe."
aww,fef3t9g,t1_feekrc4,1579047516.0,"When dog fighting was a legitimate sport, they would never use bait dogs like that.  It does nothing to improve a dog's ability to fight. It doesn't really even happen much these days, most of it is urban legend. However, we live in a society full of really stupid people who will imitate urban legend and myth, so occasionally you will get morons who do put their ""fighting dog"" up against a weaker ""bait dog,"" but these are the type of people who feed dogs gunpowder.  In the end, it's not a way to ""warm them up"" for fighting it's just sadistic people who want to watch their dog fuck up another dog."
