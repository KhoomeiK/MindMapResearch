dogs,fek45x6,t3_ep5jpm,1579192227.0,Your vet will assess your dog first and will help you with the decision. Take this time to photograph all the parts of your best friend her eyes her feet her nose. Use black and white. Video her sleeping and play music in the back ground. I went thru this in July. ((Hugs))
dogs,fe26sc8,t1_fdzrryq,1578835076.0,I have large screen TVs in most my rooms and I have a two-year-old golden retriever who stands in front of the television and barks every time an animal is on especially a dog and really especially another golden retriever.  With the large screen TVs most of the animals appear life-size to her.
dogs,fe26al0,t3_enc83c,1578834953.0,"That is so funny. I have a rescue who goes crazy at the doorbell sound on the commercials however my other three dogs have never heard a doorbell so they just watch the little rescue go crazy. 

Actually what I want commercials to quit doing is saying the word Alexa."
dogs,fdxssta,t3_en21kr,1578772517.0,bless you.. this is how my mom got all her dogs. Some people are just cruel..
dogs,fdlqnd9,t3_em0198,1578530180.0,get a pet cam set up so you can watch your fur child all day. I bet you will find out she acts like any other sighted dog when left alone...sleeeps!
dogs,fdl9p7n,t3_elvfqy,1578519435.0,"We Were always told to spay our females before their first heat otherwise they would get cancer. however with my last golden retriever puppy, my vet said that studies have shown with certain dogs such as golden retrievers it is better to let them go through one heat prior to Spaying them. That was an experience. So chat with your vet."
dogs,fdgj5fx,t3_ekmeec,1578398943.0,I don't think so. I belong to a Golden Retriever forum and so many introduce their new dogs to us as 'foster failures'..or 'The Foster who came to Stay'.....Every time I just transported a dog for a few hours I would cry when I passed them on. Your love for dogs makes you the perfect foster and maybe now that you filled that hole in your heart.. the next foster will be more like pet-sitting.
dogs,fdeskzz,t3_ekllz8,1578345732.0,Happy birthday. To both of you!
videos,fcud014,t3_e4jkbv,1577978078.0,this is NOT the worse commercial..have you seen the freaky Unstoppable ad?
