depression,ffsraap,t3_euwr8e,1580189660.0,"This is a thing in the chronic pain community! Spoon theory originated because of opiates (get it? Drugs=spoons), or at least that’s one of the perspectives I’ve heard. Most people with chronic pain have like 12 spoons at the start of the day, and depending upon how hard an activity is, the spoon count can range from 1-4,with a 1 being taking pills and a 4 being going to school. It’s generally used to describe living with chronic illness in general! But I think chronic pain and depression have very similar impacts! Here’s the chart: https://imgur.com/a/gYtoRve"

depression,ffhheo1,t3_etkvgj,1579935349.0,"Hello there, I haven’t really been active lately but I feel so strongly about this topic I thought I should speak up. I grew up with a typically masculine face— big nose, heavy eyebrows... etc. for a while I felt really messed  up abput it! All my friends said similar things to yours and that made me feel shit. But nowadays I look in the mirror and think of how I’m just not everybody’s type. That’s ok. You don’t have to be conventionally hot to be attractive. I’m a specific kind of hot and that’s not everybody’s taste. But it is for some people— because everybody has specified tastes. This is no different for you. Honest to god I was just talking to a friend of mine and we were talking about how wack it is that there’s literally no ugly personal on earth. At least one aspect of every person is objectively hot— even for a friend of ours labelled conventionally unattractive by many, we talked for ten minutes about how beautiful his eyes are and how nice his skin tone is. You are the same. There is something to like, even a big nose, even unevenness in your features or the clothes you wear. PS I am a wlw and I think it is SO hot when women wear masc clothes— I’m assuming your gender here so corrrect me if I’m wrong. The point is your friend kind of sucks. If the only way they can look at your level of attractiveness is by what they do not find attractive, they are sorta mean. When I look at my friends I basically see just the amazing parts of them. Or at least  I try. Maybe it’s time to make some new friends. Pps I have a past and present with self harm too and I know the struggle. But you’ve got this and even though you broke your streak this is a great opportunity to build a newer and stronger streak that will last way longer! A new goal. As to personality, literally fuck this guy. They do not know ahit. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and plenty of people hate my personality but plenty also love it. Find those people who love you for you. You deserve that"
