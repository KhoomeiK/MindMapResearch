The weight is clearly marked on the package, and instead of making the product more expensive like many other candy companies, they increased the price. This is extremely normal and wasn’t done in an asshole way at all."

EarthPorn,ff68laf,t1_ff651d5,1579621688.0,"I actually lived in flagstaff for a bit. The general consensus among people I met was that there is absolutely no scientific reason Arizona sunsets would be better than anywhere else and that it’s more of a random thing that people from Arizona talk about. Sorry, Arizona sunsets aren’t special in any way at all. That being said, this particular photo has some dramatic post processing, and seeing that has absolutely nothing to do with witnessing Arizona sunsets, and everything to do with being familiar with post processing techniques."

trashy,fecv3ns,t1_fecuw1j,1578985807.0,This is true. If the rental agreement states access to climate controls then this is definitely in violation. Granted in my opinion the most likely scenario here is simply that this is an old thermostat and there is just a new one somewhere else.
trashy,fecufno,t1_fecrxqg,1578985048.0,"No it wouldn’t. In Australia they would just need to be providing air conditioning if they said they were. It is very possible that there still is heating and air conditioning in addition to a fake thermostat hanging on the wall.
