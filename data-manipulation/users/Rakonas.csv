Think of your own analogies to this, where a victim (Y) is suffering from violence at the hands of a third party (X) - and therefore saying that you can do whatever you want to Y so long as it's somewhat less bad.

No society can survive the onslaught of capitalism without waging organized war on it."
chaoticgood,feooc80,t1_femxp3d,1579302979.0,Plato's Republic is trash garbage. Plato himself owned slaves. Stop pretending that somebody can write something unbiased.

worldnews,fen3h8y,t1_femv3ku,1579276141.0,This is propaganda from a PR team. Not much a fenian when you can't see brazen royal propaganda staring at you.
worldnews,fen0qjq,t1_femsng3,1579274378.0,No he's not. This is just more propaganda designed to distract from the shit the windsors are embroiled in.
