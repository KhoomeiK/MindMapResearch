I wasn’t sober for most of it, but the knowledge that I was powerless over the substance and that I was killing myself, led to my journey. I’ve relapsed twice since I got sober for real, but knowing I had to go back to AA, went back to detox, and have now joined a group and got a sponsor, I’m now changed. Drinking is ruined for me. The amount of money it takes just for me to get drunk is astronomical. I have no wish to go back to drinking a quart of liquor a day and being unemployed. I want to keep busy and have a life. If I keep drinking now, I’m gonna wake up one day at 40 broke, lonely, depressed and suicidal. I have a life to choose and this is it. IWNDWYT"
