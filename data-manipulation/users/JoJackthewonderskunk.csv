AskReddit,ffc99e4,t3_esse9d,1579794450.0,"At my first job fresh out of college I ran into a middle aged women in the hallway. I turned the corner and I about ran into her  because she was getting into an elevator at the same time and we crossed paths. I said:  ""Excuse me ma'am."" And looked at her as I said it (intending on apologizing for almost running into her. As the elevator started shutting I could see her getting redfaced angry and she straight up shouted: ""DID YOU JUST CALL ME A MAN!?!?"". 

I never got the chance to explain and clear my name but too this day I wonder what the psychological fallout was for this person after the elevator left."
