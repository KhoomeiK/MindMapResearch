college,fe1wzzk,t3_enj55m,1578831868.0,I am a math major who started university in 2018 and it's unbelievable to me that I will be halfway through my studies at the end of the next semester.
college,fcytiuf,t3_ejl3ct,1578086755.0,"Most of those codes remain valid for at least 2 years, so you can talk to someone who just took the class to try to get them to sell you the code for a cheaper price."
college,fcok4ng,t1_fcoi366,1577834248.0,"Huh, that's interesting. If I understand correctly then university is considered to be an upper middle class thing in America. Over here (Turkey), a university education is considered to be more of a ""smart"" people thing, rather than a class thing. Poor people encourage their children to go to university or not based on how intelligent the child is. This leads to a situation where you can find a lot of families where one sibling is a world-class academic while the other is a tailor. I have such examples in my own family. For example, my grandfather's younger brother graduated valedictorian from the best engineering school in the country, then went to America and got a PhD from Yale University. Right now, he is the CEO of a mid-sized company in Turkey. My grandfather, on the other hand, ran a small grocery store around the corner of his house his whole life."
college,fcohwoc,t1_fcogn6d,1577832629.0,"Dude, that is crazy. I had no idea American universities were this expensive. I live in a third world country and my combined yearly expenses for anything related to university is just a little over 1k dollars. I have a question though. How do you make this system work? How do poor people go to university for example?"
college,fcogdqk,t3_ei9l7f,1577831583.0,"28k for dormitory? WTF!? That has to be a mistake, otherwise it's cheaper if you rent a penthouse in the city."
study,fcmmzkj,t3_ehzl11,1577782260.0,3-4 hours is already too much time to spend on studying. Chances are you are not going to have to study as hard as that in your life unless you decide to go to graduate school.
LateStageCapitalism,fcer8ee,t3_eh204w,1577623053.0,It only makes sense that the CEO makes much more money than the lowest-paid employee. He is the friggin' CEO. And 70k is way too much for minimum wage. Do you really think a janitor deserves that much money? The pay for a low-skilled job shouldn't be more than 30k.
