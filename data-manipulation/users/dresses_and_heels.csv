but isn’t it your dad’s phone and YouTube account and therefore porn? It’s super creepy that she is reading sexuality into your family relationships. I am sorry you are dealing with that but hell yeah girl be comfortable! If someone is going to be sleazy about you in your own home, you are not the problem."
AmItheAsshole,ff9mnnx,t3_esd1z8,1579716192.0,"NTA - you are honest. In my opinion, if you have to ask if someone else thinks you should have kids, the answer is no. Too many people and specifically women if we are being honest, get pressured into having kids. If having kids is right for you and your partner, you will know. If your sister can't handle the hard reality of having kids, she shouldn't have them. The end."

If she is insecure about your biological family's closeness to you - dump her, she has more problems than you want to deal with. Also you've only been together for 9 months and she acts like she has expected to trump someone who has been in your life for your entire life. Red flags everywhere. Run."

Watches,feeiy1u,t3_eoq6gf,1579034691.0,"I buy watches because I like them and I think that is the mindset that makes it fun. If I can sell a watch later and I feel like I made good on the price, awesome. But I never buy a watch assuming it will increase in resale value. John Mayer talked about this in his ""talking watches"" but I totally look at my watches and go like ""theses are all the drugs I never did"" and the trips I didn't take or clothes I didn't buy. It is a good investment to me only if when I look at the watches, I am like 'yeah it was totally worth it'."
Watches,feehvot,t3_eog53c,1579034074.0,I love this watch so much. Every time I see it I just love the color combination more.

your daughter is nine, operating at that kind of a caloric deficit will likely prevent her from growing and be psychologically damaging. Protecting her from that is your job as a parent. If your sister, who I assume is also an adult, can't see that, fuck her. She is the problem."

for the record tons of shit is common but that doesn't make it right for you. It is really common to eat meat, but I am a vegetarian. It is really common to wear makeup, but you don't have to. Curate the life that makes you safe, happy, and comfortable and start by cutting out motherfuckers who don't respect your boundaries."

fashionadvice,fdl0076,t3_elql4v,1578514624.0,I think this is super cute and I love yellow on you. The waist in the pants is low for my preference but you look like you are a taller thinner person than I am.
fatlogic,fdkzv6i,t3_eluhvm,1578514549.0,"I just got out of this conversation actually and I gotta say I see the point. When I eat salad for lunch I bring a mixing bowl with a lid on it. When my friends and coworkers eat burgers or whatever, It looks like I am eating more food. When I eat pasta, I am not proud of this but it's true, I can and often do eat an entire box by myself, which is more food than the 2-4 slices of pizza my roommate eats, at least it looks that way. 

I think a major problem is the idea so many HAES people have is that all food is created equal so to them more food is just a surface area comparison. People really just don't know what is in there food and they are too fragile or scared to count calories and learn."

AskNOLA,fcm9855,t1_fclirye,1577767650.0,That is crazy to me! For sure go to Pat O's! You probably won't want to sit in the courtyard during the summer because heat but the indoor bars are beautiful and you should be able to get a server's attention long enough to get a great history of the place since it won't be so busy.

AskNOLA,fclfqjv,t3_ehp565,1577746744.0,"Evangeline has \~$20 dollar entrees for dinner and great cocktails. They are one of my favorite places in the Quarter. I feel that for the quality of food and service the price is very reasonable. 

Please U Cafe on Saint Charles absolutely is a hole in the wall and looks sketchy but the food is a total knock out. 

Bennachin on Royal is amazing African food that really ought not be missed in my opinion. (it is also great if you are vegetarian or vegan or just looking for something lighter) 

Tracy's in the Irish channel has kick-ass poboys but a pretty diverse menu of bar food and general snicky snacks.

If you are up hella late in the quarter St. Lawerence has ""divine food until 2am"" and they aren't kidding. The service is slow but if you have time to kill."

Late summer is a good offseason for us because it will be hot and humid. It will likely rain every afternoon but if you don't mind weather that can't make up its mind, summer is a great, beautiful time to be in NOLA. 

Drawback - summer or at least late summer to early fall is hurricane season. Shoot for after July 4th but before August 10th you'll be fine!"
AskNOLA,fclcv31,t3_eht1eb,1577744873.0,"Creole Garden Guest House is such a cute spot! It's in a great part of town too. It's not super touristy but close to everything. The drawback, getting anywhere during rush hour in a car will absolutely take an additional 30 minutes minimum.

WG Creole House 1850 is also a solid contender. I've never been but I drive past it all the time. It looks super cute. You are going to hit the same traffic problem but probably slightly worse as it is on a one-way street.

I don't have any knowledge of the other options you listed but I can say that Le Pavillion is a nice hotel but not one with much character unique to New Orleans.
