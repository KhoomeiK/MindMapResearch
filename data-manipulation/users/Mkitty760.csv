AskReddit,fenyn90,t1_fen5rox,1579292691.0,"Whenever I see the name Phuket, my mind goes back to this story...

About 15 years ago I worked for an animal charity that sent a full surgical rig into low-income areas and provided free spay/neuter surgeries for people who otherwise wouldn't ever take their pet to the vet due to cost. One of our founders was a wealthy man who would cover costs when donations were low. As he was such an integral part of the operation, no one ever said no to him.

Part of the vehicle wrap included an image of a brick road, and one of our fundraising efforts was the ability to purchase a brick and have it ""inscribed"" with a memorial to a beloved pet. He, of course, bought the largest one, and had us put his cat's name on it, Phuket.

It was on there for about 2 months when we received the 5,000th call complaint that we had some nerve driving around with ""Fuck it"" on our truck and that was no way to generate support for our organization.

This is just as frustrating for us as it is for you. Let me explain things from our side of it....

You pull up to the gate. I ask for the name or address of the person you are visiting.  -*Please don't get mad and tell me you're not ""visiting"", that you're working. It's the script we have to use. Going off-script will get us fired.*

-*Please don't pull up and tell us you're delivering to John.  Dude, I have over 1000 residences in some of these communities. Do you have any idea how many people named John are on my resident listing? A LOT. Please give the address. We'll get into names shortly.*

-*Please, for God's sake,  be prepared when you pull up with the address. Don't drive up, get pissed off because no one immediately comes on the speaker,  then tell us ""yeah, just a minute."" Fuck you, pull around, get prepared, and come back.  Every gate I handle that takes over 50 seconds goes in my file. After a year, it's nearly impossible to get a raise.*

-*Please do yourselves and us a favor: ask if they are in a gated community when you receive the order. If the person says yes, please tell them they MUST add you to their visitor list. Not your name, just your business. Door Dash, Postmates, Uber Eats, Delivery Dudes, whoever. It will make things go so incredibly much faster for everyone. My gate time is under 50 seconds, you get your job done faster, and the customer gets their food while it's still hot.*

-***Please verify that the address they have given you is CORRECT. I work nights, and have been written up because I woke someone up out of a sound sleep at 3am because the address I was given was wrong. Equally, please make certain you are giving the agent the correct address. I've actually had drivers tell me ""1234 Main Street, or something like that."" NO. Fuck you. Not ""something like that."" It is or it isn't. ***

-*Speaking of addresses, **if it's an apartment or condo, we will need the unit number.** Always. Every time.*

-*Once we figure out where you're going,  we'll need to know who you are. When we ask for your name or company, it's not your name we need to know, it's your company. Again, it's a script I have to follow. Again, DD, PM, UE, Del.Dudes, Instacart, etc. If the customer has put you on their visitor list,  it will be the name of the company, not your personal name.*

I'm sure there is more, but this is all I have for now. Ask me questions, I'll gladly answer. I've worked Uber Eats before, I know it can really suck for you guys, I'm not coming down on you, just offering some insight on how to make things go a little smoother for all of us."

The point is, LAOP needs to get an arborist to evaluate the age and health of the trees, and a professional estimate on cost to replace with equal value trees. If OP does as advised in this post, he will obtain a competent attorney who will then handle this for him. It's usually not a good idea to take as gospel any advice from arm-chair arborist attorneys on the internet who have not seen the trees in person. The only solid advice in this thread is to get an attorney, preserve the scene (and lumber and stumps), photograph the area, and photograph the tree removal service vehicle. The attorney will handle the rest.

Editing to add: I am not anti-r/legaladvice. I love this sub, and I love reading the advice of all the different contributors. I'm only echoing what I've read in this sub so many times.
