DnD,ffgfeed,t3_ethkpn,1579905006.0,"Fish, probably. Unless you want a special resource to be found specifically in that area.

The population range you gave is way to high to accurately estimate, really,

At the low end of that scale, practically the entire community would be subsistence fishers, or otherwise involved in that industry. Maybe one family would own a shop building, maybe selling eggs from chickens raised by the rest of the community, or other amenities acquired from occasional ships that make a pit stop in the area to resupply, rest, or have services performed. For example, a large vessel needs cleaning and re-sealing occasionally, and most men in a rural coastal village would gladly perform the backbreaking manual labour for relatively cheap. The girls in the village probably assist women of other houses in day to day running (cooking, cleaning) in exchange for money for their families. 


At the higher end, the population is high enough for people to take a role that doesn’t directly feed them, but instead earns them enough to buy what they need. Perhaps some people dive wrecks (if the local fishing method already involves diving), or pastoral farming for secondary resources (leather, wool). Maybe there’s a woman who makes soap, or something like that.


As for the illicit side of the economy, a remote village might be a good location for fencing smuggled goods. Leave supplies in a place where ships normally wreck, and villagers can recover and sell those resources to passing trade caravans without suspicion.  Drugs, alcohol, weapons, and more can pass into a kingdom this way, hidden under food being transported to a hungry major city."

Can someone help me see both perspectives? I’m a DM and a player, but my only experience with rangers was a oneshot as a beast master. Boy that sucked but it’s just one subclass."
dndmemes,fffil7m,t3_etcchz,1579884744.0,"I hate the idea that the other classes have it easy.

Bards have to study too. Most of them end up learning to manipulate both people and the fabric of reality via the medium of sound and the natural heartbeat of creation. Not everyone can pick up a flute and do that, but a trained bard could pick up almost any instrument and cast with it.

Sorcerers have to learn to restrain their power as much as they have to learn to channel it, if only to avoid endangering everyone around them. Wild magic sorcerers, the generally most common, often don’t manage to fully get a handle on it hence the high possibility of things going wrong for them. What might happen if they didn’t have a level of focus.

Warlocks are either subtly siphoning power from an eldritch being, or are actively performing rituals and services in exchange for booms from those same entities (contact or no contact is still up to the player/DM in the latter case; demons and devils would often set up rituals that don’t require their direct attention as passive ways of attracting followers)

Druids have to be in tune with the living, breathing energy of the world. They can commune with elemental spirits, celestial powers, and many things in between, from unicorns to ki-rin to avatars of nature’s wrath. Often they serve as healers, keepers of knowledge, mediators, negotiators and advisors to their communities, even if they live apart from their circle, their home culture, or any established Druidic presence beyond themselves or perhaps local rangers.

Clerics don’t just pray, they devote their entire lives to the service of a higher power, living and acting according to their tenants, memorising sacred hymns, myths and legends both terrific and terrifying to keep the people on the right track.


To take that away, to dumb down every caster class (even wizards, whose esoteric arts go far beyond just book learning) is to do a disservice to your games and the characters you could be playing."
40kLore,ffdrqof,t3_et2izw,1579827304.0,"Villain is often regarded as the least out of touch. His astartes even in his absence make a point of living among human populations. They avoid collateral and fight to protect civilians, refusing to trade lives or sacrifice mortals for strategic reasons.

Guilliman is a pragmatist, a tactician. He solves problems on a grander scale than any human life. After a naval battle he might publicly congratulate a particular captain to boost their popularity, improving morale and shifting local imperial politics to a more favourable state for guilliman. He would do so and then discard all memory of the officer as soon as he moves away. That persons life only matters in that it can serve a purpose.

That is what the imperium needs, but it lacks heart in much the same way as the imperium did before his return, only without the corruption and self interest of mortal leadership."

(I go with this, as the cap and the iron boots and the scythe/sickle are part of the fundamental nature of the creature rather than being artificially created implements. Perhaps the redcaps can only remove them themselves while soaking them in blood, and it has to return to their heads after the supply of blood runs out. It has to be magi-physiological in nature since they die/stop existing if it goes without blood soaking for three days."

However, my overwhelming experience of men in relationships is that the reason they do not sleep around on top is either that their purely sexual needs are being met or that they value their emotional intimacy more than any pursuit of sex. Either the reward means nothing to them or the idea of abandoning what they already have is unthinkable to them."
changemyview,ff4rj52,t3_ermyab,1579570712.0,"Do you have any evidence that this is the case?

Certainly, a large chunk of the male population has chasing skirt as a frequent activity, but so do an equally large amount of women, within a similar age range, who share the same enthusiasm for drinking and dancing.

I argue that men are just as capable of love of women, and that perceived disengagement in relationships could reasonably be described by a difference in the wants and needs between men and women, in the levels any types of intimacy men are comfortable with, as a result of differing general expectations placed on men and women (see http://www.elainehatfield.com/uploads/3/4/5/2/34523593/54._hatfield__rapson_1994.pdf for further detail on this point).

Men are not lust-filled automatons. We feel. We love. It’s genuinely surprising that you would think we are all looking for as much sex as possible with as many people as possible instead of looking for a relationship, for commitment, and a long term future.

Edit: the independent article you linked in the body of your post is biased as hell.

If you rule that the kraken is native to the current plane, it’s a 1 minute timeout for it, maximum.

I f the kraken they’re fighting is an extra planar entity then they will be banished to there instead, but it only becomes permanent after the spell ends without breaking concentration.

Either way, all the krakens minions have to do is make the caster fail a concentration save and they get squid daddy back. Of a kraken will have minions, of course. Sahuagin, kuo-toa, merfolk (insane or mentally enslaved), a plethora of conventional and magical beasts and monsters, and some high level casters, potentially even from surface races. 

The kraken is a smart enemy, able to build a cult following through dishing out wealth, power, promises, and magical enslavement. It would likely prepare for someone banishing it, or inform its minions what to do in that event, especially if it is a planar invader. They are smart and kind of paranoid like beholders, but far and away superior. It should never be a simple thing to just bamf one with a mid level spell slot and sit around for 60 seconds. At the very least an impromptu game of keep-away needs to happen to keep the caster from harm so that the kraken remains trapped."

MonsterHunterWorld,fezxjdi,t3_er0y3n,1579462988.0,"Positioning is key. Know where it can hit you from and when it leaves itself exposed. If you let it, it will chase you and chase you and never let the pressure off. Staying out of the way of it’s head and arms gives you openings, but remember to be close enough to roll through or away from a tail swipe.

When I first hunted it in mh3u I used a lance, but since then I’ve happily hunted it using anything I used at the time.

Heavy weapons can make use of the openings and get more dps out of tripping it, whereas lighter weapons like the glance and the smaller swords can reposition around it and apply pressure of their own, making their own opportunities.

It’s worth looking at wether status ailments or traps are worth using. If you need a head or arms break, bombs might be useful. Brachy can be easily hunted by a group with a game plan, but discoordinated randoms will get in each other’s way, and make the monster less predictable so your safe zones become less safe.

Why did you feel the need to nitpick and imply I thought we could eat people. Even the least developed human societies, such as the remaining pre-fire groups that resist attempts at communication (with good reason) are clearly far and away above the most intelligent non-humans in intelligence and societal complexity, with their own language, oral tradition, the ability to create complex tools such as bows and boats, all things that fundamentally set them apart from other animal species."

I no more support the torture of non-human animals than I do of people.

My arbitrary criteria for whose deaths I find acceptable and whose I abhor is entirely based on wether or not they are human, as no animal has (as far as I am aware) displayed intelligence and awareness that make them people or even really people-like. Dogs and pigs and dolphins and crows are smarter than we normally give them credit for but in the absence of humans they wouldn’t have anything close to society, so we have an evolutionary timescale during which the deaths of animals for food and materials, often animals bred over human generations for this purpose, doesn’t bother me."

Unfortunately, the standard format is very high power level right now. Most decks are strong enough that taking out the best (usually rarest) cards will cause them to fall behind.

You can still compete, and you can’t lose ranked progress in the early stages so you lose nothing. Every time you go up a tier (bronze/silver/gold/etc) you can’t drop down, and you qualify for rewards at the end of the season (this season ends in about 2 weeks)

I had good success early on with a Gruul (Red & Green) aggro deck, because aggressive decks tend to run lots of small creatures which are cheaper to craft. Gruul in particular is fast enough to get you some wins, but also creates big enough creatures to defend you against the almost aggressive decks like mono Red. Particularly useful was the riot mechanic (creatures with it can either have haste or +1/+1) and cards like grumgully which gives your creatures +1/+1 when you play them.

We tend to build up a picture of what ‘sounds right’ that guides us through all of the nonsense. There’s a hidden rhythm to our word order, and a half-logic, half-intuition way of telling how a word should be spelt.

We bought or stole or were forced into having our language this way because of how we assimilated cultures or were assimilated ourselves. Animals are all named one way, but the meat products are named using a completely different system stolen from another language because they once invaded us and made up our ruling class, for example.


at least you aren’t learning Welsh, which despite sitting so close to so many other languages, is one of the most divergent from any other still spoken today, and is very difficult to learn for people with no prior exposure to it.

We have as much trouble learning other languages as other people have learning ours. Not seeing a need to speak a 2nd language is just ignorance on our part, but learning structures, rules, and ways of speaking that do not exist in your culture drives many away. Gendered words, tenses that don’t exist in English, hell we aren’t even taught what conjugations are until we cover french in school, because they are so much simpler in English that we don’t have to understand the idea, we just remember how things change.

The average male human runs at about 10ft/second (source: basic maths performed on the first google search result for “normal human running speed”), upping this from 60ft/6s to 80ft/6s sounds pretty good to me. Not word competition level, but it would be a good natural advantage for someone who was aiming for competitive success, and is enough to make life easier for me when running to class or generally going anywhere. You won’t do many things more than you walk (for the averagely abled person, and a less abled person would get a higher quality of life increase from a mobility increase of 10 or 20ft every 6 seconds).

Ignoring difficult terrain sounds great. No more struggling with bushes, stairs, arrayed Lego’s, less risk of injury in stupid situations most people are sensible enough to avoid, and it would be great for navigating the mess-filled environment of a student flat.

The last bit of the feat, well I’m in the UK so we don’t have gun crime as a major cultural problem, but knife crime and drunken blunt assaults are both relatively significant risks, and being able to move quickly enough to avoid all potential for getting hit while moving well out of danger even without successfully hitting an aggressor, would be a welcome security net.

It’s the amperage that kills you, as a highly damaging single electron is so insignificant to your body that it poses almost no risk. You get routinely bombarded with radiation, attacked by pathogens, and suffer other environmental damage far exceeding this every couple seconds. With a high amperage setup, lots of energy flows into you over relatively small time frames, accumulating much more damage as each electron fires can hit a cell or cell component or something and locally really fuck up an area.

Lightning strikes are a combination of both, for example. A charge difference between clouds and the ground builds up due to friction and some other effects accumulating electrons in the clouds, and when it reaches a certain point they jump to a convenient target: tree, building, person, etc. Lots of electrons jump with a lot of force and then (in the case of a human getting hit) everything starts to smell of bacon."
