dogs,fgm0rql,t1_fglknls,1580915559.0,"""Adopt OR shop"" is much more reasonable. I am strongly against backyard breeders or for-profit breeders and pet stores but I believe that there is a place for good, ethical breeders who are committed to their dogs and to improving the breed. Nobody should be shamed for doing their research and going the breeder route. It's that dark void of backyard ""breeders"" and puppy mills that are the real ethical concern."
dogs,fgm0i7b,t1_fgloc8u,1580915385.0,"We have cats, and that was one of the reasons we decided to go through a breeder for a dog -- the cats came first, and we needed a puppy to ensure we could raise a cat-friendly dog, and we chose a breed that is known to get along with cats very well. I would be traumatized if I adopted a cat-friendly adult dog and got him home only to find out he hates cats or has a high prey drive."
dogs,fglzsyk,t1_fglx66k,1580914920.0,"I got approved by my breeder after an interview process, and once she confirmed that we were going to be good dog owners, she brought up the personal limitations I'd have in owning a dog and HOW SHE WOULD HELP US WITH THOSE. Like housetraining in an apartment, for example. The rescues, on the other hand seemed to see only the minor obstacles (not having a fenced-in yard, being in an apartment, albeit a large one) as complete roadblocks. 

My breeder has decades of experience and is well respected and she knows the kinds of homes she wants her puppies to go to, and I know I'll receive lifetime support from her."
dogs,fglzg3w,t3_ez1c7p,1580914678.0,"The dog rescues in my province are really frustrating to work with. I work in cat rescue myself so I know how emotional it can be, and when I adopt out my rescue cats I'm picky about my adopters, but within reason of course.

But I've been turned down by two dog rescues because I rent and don't have a fenced-in yard, despite the fact that I'm experienced, I am surrounded by parks, I have a flexible work schedule in a dog-friendly office, I'm financially secure, you name it. 

I'm going through a breeder for my first dog because I don't want to deal with dog rescues anymore, and because I'm pretty clear on the kind of dog and types of traits I want. I've found an amazing breeder after months of research and she is ethical and well respected. 

I don't even want to tell my dog rescue-snob acquaintances that I'm getting a purebred, CKC registered puppy later this year because I know the blowback I'll face. But as someone who has been involved in animal rescue for my entire adult life, I know my own ethics and I know that good, responsible, well-educated and well-meaning breeders are out there and exist for the right reasons."
90DayFiance,ffr3943,t3_euq2dw,1580149498.0,I loved her. Her facial expressions were absolutely killing me.
90DayFiance,ffilfsh,t1_ffiimv2,1579976689.0,Thank you for being a responsible breeder!
90DayFiance,ffihhhe,t1_ffifxcj,1579973986.0,"Thank you! Without even looking at his post, I can pretty much assume his dogs are not registered, not titled, and not health tested. Who even knows what the parents are like!"
SuperMorbidlyObese,fffrqyo,t3_etbtcm,1579890372.0,"I have PCOS and unfortunately weight does contribute to it, and it contributes to weight gain. Such a lovely feedback cycle D:
Strangely, my cycle is much more regular now at 40 than it was at 30 even though I weight about 20 lbs more, although I do eat way better now and get better sleep and have less stress."
AskReddit,ffc6r7h,t3_esps5n,1579792836.0,My husband dying suddenly and without warning. My father dropped dead of a heart attack out of the blue three years ago and I'm still struggling with it. Thinking it could happen to my husband keeps me up at night and gives me panic attacks.
cats,ff2rlhb,t3_er7fi9,1579521009.0,We taught one of our girls to give high fives. I'll give her some extra ones tonight in memory of Russell. He looks like the goodest of boys <3

puppy101,fds6hpn,t3_emtvn8,1578695448.0,These are very reasonable prices — we pay higher than that in Toronto. A puppy’s first year is going to be expensive because they need a series of boosters as well as parasite control. Factor in money for vaccines/parasite control/heartworm every year from here on in as well. None of these things are negotiable frills.
