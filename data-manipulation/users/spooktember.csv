cat,feq7yzj,t1_feq1sp1,1579338635.0,"It was harder on my brother as it was his dog, and he was about 6 at the time, so the right age to get super attached, but not old enough, I think, to understand why the dog bit him. That's what was really upsetting, why did his dog bite him? He was bit in the face, too, on the cheek below his eye, but fortunately the bite didn't break the skin, just left a big welt and nasty bruise. I think we were all pretty shaken by it, and mom was mostly upset about the bite. That was just a little more than she could take, and it shook her bad. It was a couple years before we got another dog. But, that next dog was a greyhound and she was the sweetest, gentlest, most loving dog ever. The most absolutely destructive to property as a puppy (holy cow!), sure, but she never bit or snapped at a living soul -- she was just a terror the carpet on the stairs and any stray shoes lying around.  

We're all grown up now, and my brother is such a dog lover, so the incident didn't leave him with any lasting emotional trauma. He's had dogs his whole life, heck he's got three right now. 

I'm sorry you had to give up your doggo. Pets are a part of the family, so that's never easy, but, it's clearly for the best for you and your dog that she goes to a new home. Hug your kiddos and your kitty close!"

cat,feq0z7r,t1_fepvd05,1579335821.0,"That’s sad, I’m sorry. We had a similar problem with an Irish Setter when I was a kid. A generally good dog, but he had moments of anxiety and aggression. And though he was being trained, one day, playing catch went too far when the dog bit my little brother before he could throw the ball. No lasting damage to my brother, but our mom couldn’t trust the dog anymore. It’s such a tough situation, but a mom’s priority always has to be the kiddos.
