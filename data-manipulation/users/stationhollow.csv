Now trying to decide who h EX is next. So much better value to get the 200 EX item over the 100 multi z power for SPs since EXs are not only rarer individually but you only get 250z, not 600z. I'm 450 off EX Broly reaching 6.

Now I'm debating whether it should go to Broly or one of the newer EXs (the 2 frieza force from last UST or the androids from this lot). Or if I should just spend it on normal and get my new Gogeta to 6 stars or Janemba better than 3 (but l that could happen anyway with the GSPs and dailies)."
DragonballLegends,ff5hhnm,t1_feyxso0,1579593092.0,Best for regen and movies IMO. Maybe Tapion has a spot if you have 6 stars and they're using Shallot.
DragonballLegends,ff5hfq3,t1_feyw9v8,1579593020.0,"His green is so frustrating. Immobilizes (like SSJ3 Gotenks's screen or the frieza greens), +75% to the next strike or special move attack inflicted (doesn't stack). Also if the opposing unit is a movies saga unit then it destroys all cards on their hand.

Th3 downside is it needs close range to hit but counters tap or blast arts (so if you can't vanish it you need to counter with a strike, special move, or ultimate/awakened art.

On top of all that he gives you a strike arts card that inflicts a debuffs for 10% more damage received.

His main ability gives a special arts card, and +30% damage with -5 strike arts cost both for 30 times counts. Unique abilities give him 30 no when swapped in, +40% damage for 15 times counts, and gradually restores health every count for 30 times counts (not sure how much but imagine even 1% would be crazy). 

And that's only the first ability. The 2nd gives a permanent +30% damage buff and -20% damage against characters from movies and every time your opponent uses a special arts card while he is on the field, he gets a 20% damage buff and enemy loses 30 ki. That last one alone essentially neutralizes half of the green cards in the game lol."
DragonballLegends,ff5elip,t1_ff5ebn3,1579589559.0,Did you finish my comment? I addressed this. It was about not having Baby and SSB Goku. Need to swap one. If you get rid of SSB then ex Raditz is great. If you get rid of Be by then KK Goku fits.
DragonballLegends,ff5c2vm,t3_erq20u,1579586815.0,"Honestly that's pretty damn good for a new guy may be swap out Baby for KK Goku (I can't remember does KK Goku give the double stat buff at 3 and gain the son family tag at 6 or gain both st 6). 

If you use Baby then swap put SSB Goku for something that buffs saiyans (like EX Raditz if you have him)."
DragonballLegends,ff5bgfo,t1_ff3e7mi,1579586177.0,It would be a cool idea if they added a multi z power item that can only be used on units 3 stars of less that gives 250 z power or something like that but limit it to 1 per round.
DragonballLegends,ff5bca6,t1_ff32ouz,1579586061.0,Getting 500 z power for any unit except event or legends limited unit is great
DragonballLegends,ff4lcs1,t1_ff2ezsr,1579566408.0,"It's so stupid since there is a cover change mechanic already in coop. I just never used Cell, ITku, Got Gohan or another teleport save.

And it makes 50% of the equipment useless."
DragonballLegends,ff4ir03,t1_ff3w2e0,1579564591.0,"Or probdbly have units from all different teams to begin with. Each unit has tags that indicate synergy. Piccolo has the regeneration tag for example. SSJ Goku has the Saiyan tag and the Super Saiyan tag. Every unit has a z ability (viewable in the 3rd tab of their character sheet). This applies to the whole party that meets the criteria. So it might say: +21% to ""Tag: Saiyan"" base strike attack during battle. Then if it's in your party even if you don't pick that unit to fight, the units you do pick that are Saiyans will get 21% added to their base strike attack.

At higher star levels (when you've gotten the unit multiple times) these can improve to include multiple stats and or multiple tags. It could say: +xx% to Tag: Android base Strike and Blast Defense during battle at star level 3 for Super Android 17 bit at star level 6 changes to +yy% to Tag: Android or Tag: GT base Stroke and Blast Defense during battle. This makes them more versatile since you want to build a team that contains good units that have good colour coverage (advantages and weaknesses) and z ability bonuses. Super Android 17 at lower star levels works best in an Android team due to the synergy and at star level 6, that synergy extends to GT units too. 

Don't focus too much on it however. It is just a part. My fusion warriors team uses Super Android 17. They get zero z ability buffs from him at all but he synergizes in other ways."
DragonballLegends,ff4hjfj,t1_ff38c3h,1579563764.0,Do units that transform in battle count like AngryKu? I'm st this one myself bit haven't tried yet.
DragonballLegends,ff4h4cv,t1_ff35t6h,1579563473.0,"Beware units that dispels buffs and can lock main abilities if you use Shallot. Beerus laughs at him. Not only can he stop him using his transformation for 10 seconds when swapped in but he can do this 2 more times interrupting either the transformation or the main ability that buffs further. Also Beerus's green dispels buffs removing like 3/4ths of the transformation buffs you get of caught by it. Originally Beerus could only use this once but Zenkai Beerus can use it 3 times.

New Bardock is underrated IMO. Good defense. Cover ability that reduces damage by 30% but increases his special move damage by 75%. He gains an auto 30% damage and 20% damage reduction for 15 counts on swap in if there is another saiyan in the party, gains 40% strike damage if an ally is defeated, and when he dies, it heals all other saiyan battle members 20% and increases damage by 25%.

That's on top of his special move that debuffs to increase enemy special moves by 25 ki. Him and Shallot make a great team.

If you partner him with a blue as well like AngryKu (or another) you can use one of your bench slots for the ridiculous yellow/blue buffs provided by EX Broly at 6 stars or Hit for his shittier cousin (Broly: 40% strike attack and blast defense to blue and yellow. Hit: 35% strike attack and defense).

AngryKu works well because he is a last man standing unit who already gets a 50% heal. Bardock adds another 20% to that too."

DragonballLegends,ff2ciuf,t3_eqzajz,1579500707.0,Just bring along LL Beerus and ruin his day lol. Locks main abilities for 10 seconds each swap in 3 times and special arts removes buffs.
DragonballLegends,ff2c9d0,t1_ff23uts,1579500439.0,"I used SSJ Bardock, Super Vegito, and PUR Goku Black. Used Bardock to try and waste blast cards, gain full ki and dragonballs before swapping to Vegito for massive damage. The main's heal is great and the ultimate really helps take out a tier when you're in trouble.

Goku Black is suprisingly useful. His special card gives +15% strike damage the first use, +15% blast damage the second use, then +10% health each time after. His main ability draws a special card, heals him for 20% and buffs his damage for 30% for 15 timer counts.

On top of all the his uniques really help. He has a cover change that reduces damage by 50% where he heals 10% of the damage received afterwards while getting a 50% damage buff for 15 seconds. He has a permanent +35% damage buff against Saiyans and when he is switched to standby he reduces enemy ki by 20 and gives a debuff that increases damage taken by 30% for 30 timer counts.

The cycle of Bardock to Vegito, deal as much damage as possible until the buff wears off, to Black using cover change (auto +85% damage - and another 50% for each combo or attack received. AI love single ki blasts too), holding off for a while to gain ki and use specials to heal before starting over.

The +30% damage received debuff combined with SSJ Bardock's crit and crit damage buff on Vegito's pure force just melted him.

Cleared it easily before 100 counts were over. Bardock did eat a ult and died 2 hits off the end of the 2nd bar but a RR and some hits took that final bar out easy."

DragonballLegends,ff2afyo,t1_ff0sw4m,1579498656.0,That Goku's thing is that he gains buffs over the match at different intervals.

DragonballLegends,fejg1vy,t3_epcpba,1579172508.0,"On the SSJ4 Goku step up, all I wanted was him at 3 stars for the Son Family buff. At the start of it all I had a 2 star SV. By the time I got my 3 star SSJ4 Goku? 7 star..."

gaming,fefg28g,t1_fef6w7f,1579055569.0,Agree to disagree. Bethesda world design is a love it or hate it but even so I would prefer to play Fallout 3 or NV again over playing Fallout 4 again. I just disliked the entire perk system and the world felt like it was a bunch of individual unrelated set pieces made first and placed on a map later.

Games,fedou6p,t1_fecmazo,1579016656.0,When they started selling tickets to the public the industry level stuff was already declining fast.
gaming,fedms2q,t1_fdmhbay,1579015334.0,"There are game a with better shooting, better RPG mechanics, and better exploration. Fallout 4 combines them but at a lower standard. I guess if you like Bethesda's random location with a note or recording telling a random story that makes no real sense outside it's immediate surroundings resulting in you killing enemies be my guess."
AmItheAsshole,fedmgpa,t1_fedmc2p,1579015125.0,Ive alr4ady explaoned why i feel OP was a minor asshole. Her reaction was understandable but still bad behaviour. We disagree. That's it. The end.
AmItheAsshole,fedmaa3,t1_fedlzhx,1579015005.0,There's a whole bunch of assholes. Highest is step dad. Mom is an asshole as well for bullying her daughter and participating in the whole incident. And that is ignoring the others.
