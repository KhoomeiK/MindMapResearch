Edit: Its still there on my desktop speakers, though it is not nearly as bad. Seems a combination of my poor phone speaker and something else. As u/Taurothar pointed out, it could be a bitrate issue."

The volume (at least on my phone where I usually watch this stuff) was spiking every time you made an ""S"" sound. With so many in this video it made it hard to listen to for me.

The wyvrn/drake form of dragon with just wings is central or south American iirc. Many cultures have different dragons. Like the Asian ones with no wings.

I am asking for my cousin who was hoping to get $100 for the pile. I knew it was more, but I havent bought and sold things in a very long time and the wide variance in prices threw me off badly.

I'm just glad I can tell him he can get better.  The stone rain is MP. No binder dings or pits to speak of. Edges are the issue."
