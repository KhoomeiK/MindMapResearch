What do you mean by 'entry'??  I'm still confused why it took so much longer than you first thought

I've never heard of or seen BGS, thats a more stringent company that grades cards?  When would you go BGS vs PSA?

How much does it cost to get graded?

I've seen non graded cards sell for a buck and a PSA 10 sell for $10, is it really that much more to have a 'perfect' card?  

Thanks :)"
