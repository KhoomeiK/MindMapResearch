Blogging,ffiit3x,t1_ffiicx0,1579974886.0,Thanks for the wise tips! I'll definitely use some of these you suggested. Do you think I can go first month with just domain or with the WordPress plan and after a month get the other thing because of my budget? Btw Can I get billed monthly not annually on WP?
Blogging,ffiig4j,t1_ffii1en,1579974634.0,So I must get domain first thing and get a membership or whatever it's called?
Blogging,ffigpau,t1_ffifsz0,1579973453.0,"I want to post about a lot of stuff health related, help people achieve goals from losing weight to stuff like getting self disciplined. 
Eventually create a YouTube account (after I get a solid blog). Later monetize the blog as making small ""courses"" and finding sponsors that will benefit the readers also. 
It wouldn't be a page like some YouTube channels that force their products to sell. 
I have a lot of stuff for the blog on my mind."
