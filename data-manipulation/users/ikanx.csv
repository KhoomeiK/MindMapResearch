Normal form Lucci is 2.58m

Normal size Luffy is 1.74m


While hybrid form Lucci's height is never officially stated, I agree with you, it's around 4.5m and 3m for the SeimeiKikan form."

OnePiece,ff7i1jc,t1_ff77fva,1579650030.0,"Oda asked this in an SBS. DF user partially submerged in any body of water (sea, lake, bathtub, etc) will be weakened. But playing in a knee-deep water or rain won't affect them. Of course there are exception like Crocodile.

For Kalifa, the water level isn't clear. What we just saw are just bubble. It could be just a little bit of water with a lot of bubbles and we just assumed that the water is as full as we normally take."
PixelArt,ff11rb9,t1_feyhksc,1579474388.0,"The left ones are definitely harder to make, but I think there are certain charm to the right ones. The left ones don't necessarily ""worse"", imo. I like the simplicity and would chose them in certain cases."
manga,ff0rmbu,t1_fezou72,1579471669.0,The fruit is with Bon Clay now. So that old hag is gonna die one way or another before current timeline.

marvelstudios,fei61xo,t1_fei5qxn,1579131077.0,Don't need to look when you know where things are/will be at.
marvelstudios,fei5hso,t1_fei0q58,1579130723.0,He was looking though. And probably assumed that the chitauri scooter won't change its course and then just looking at other things/deciding next target.
RoastMe,fegpq4l,t1_fegnvdy,1579099613.0,"Truth. Not really bass-inspiring for me, but I found out about him from 100 bass line videos. Looking at his ""content"" right now just make me sad."
OnePiece,feg678y,t1_feg18ht,1579078837.0,"Skypiea arc was basically hundreds years story. From the meeting of Norland and Calgarra, to Luffy ringing the bell for Cricket. I felt sadness and frustration when Norland arrived at Jaya just to find Calgarra not there anymore and when Calgarra dies fighting to light the fire of Shandora.

Those feelings paid off when Luffy rings the bell. A simple sound that means so much and an amazing closure of those hundreds years story.

That climax basically put it in my top 1 arc. I used that ""We are here"" panel for my desktop wallpaper for sooo long."
marvelstudios,fed2nr3,t1_fecu66s,1578995714.0,"Where did his skill came from? Is it genetics, effort, mutation, experiment? Did he had it when he's a child?"

OnePiece,fdt2e2q,t1_fdrrd1r,1578711025.0,"I read somewhete that B's division is based on function. Marco is the doctor and leads Medical Division, Ace/Oden was excavation iirc, Vista was swordsmen/attack division, etc. I used to think that Oden was previous Vista's commander and mentor to Vista (since both are dual-wielders)."

OnePiece,fdmc35n,t1_fdlwvz7,1578545202.0,Things like this made me want to learn japanese myself tbh. I dislike some aspect of Viz's translation but I can see that Arthur/fan translation might not be correct too. I hate the fact that I can't read it myself in the original language it was written in.
marvelstudios,fdjqmp4,t1_fdj443f,1578483728.0,"I do remember TAO said that magic (that she teaches) uses ""dimensional energy"" as a source of power. I interpreted that as fuel for magic in the MCU. It was when TAO explained magic to Strange for the first time."
OnePiece,fdjdnv5,t1_fdff041,1578466498.0,I think even a lot of earlier OP movies are better than Stampede tbh. Stampede lacks even basic aspecs of OP like adventure. The character drama we got was basically just >!Usopp!< and the execution has been done countless time.
OnePiece,fdjdnv4,t1_fde3box,1578466498.0,I watched it in theater with my OP friends a couple weeks ago. We got almost bored mid-movie and felt it was severely lacking after the movie ended. We do agree the animation are great except some 3D animation near the end.
