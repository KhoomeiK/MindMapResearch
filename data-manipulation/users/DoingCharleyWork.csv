I can usually wake myself up out of it pretty quickly now because I practiced lucid dreaming for a little while. It will seem vivid and very real but there will always be some details that are off.

IdiotsInCars,fei625c,t1_fehuyxy,1579131081.0,"It will always be high because they are fast and cheap. In the us it is way, way to easy to get a bike and get out on the road with next to no experience. 

Everyone talks about people that wreck their new mustangs because they don't know how to handle the car because it's way more power than they are used to. It's the same thing with bikes. The difference is they don't have a safety cage protecting them when they hit a tree. You get a lot of young, dumb, inexperienced riders that don't really understand how to operate a motorcycle.
