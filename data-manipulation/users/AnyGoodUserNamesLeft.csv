I think I have ""Exit... Stage Left"" on laserdisk somewhere..."
rush,feocoht,t3_epw5fn,1579298218.0,"This has really been a gut punch, though the pain of it all is easing. Has been wonderful reading all the stories from friends and fans.

Like as others have said, Rush music non stop on my travelling. Haven't been sleeping great either (various reasons), but found 'Rush Radio' on the TuneIn app and have that running (quietly) while I'm in bed & can't sleep.

I hope Neil's family, Alex & Geddy have the support they need at this time."

DevinTownsend,feelb1m,t3_eojgtt,1579036062.0,"I caught SYL playing in a \[very\] local nightclub back in  June 1998. There was only about 30 of us in the venue and Devin asked everyone their names (""we're getting paid anyway"") and even had a race with one guy around the club. Loudest gig ever been to, my ears physically hurt afterwards.   


Wear earplugs kids."

You did the right thing, it's what we do for our girls (and roos).  


Hope she's okay (and what's her name?)."
rush,fe182c9,t3_enhtwv,1578823563.0,"Mine was Grace Under pressure, bought because I liked the album cover (hadn't really heard of Rush before that). Changed everything."
