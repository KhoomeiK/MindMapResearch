I was responding to this comment ""Industry is part of your consumption though"". To which pointing out that the end consumer is not Canadian is important. 

My arguments have all been that percapita is not a useful metric in this case due to the disparity between population and industry.

Canada has a waste problem. I didn't deny that. Just pointed out that that one figure is particularly misleading, and not particularly helpful. This figure doesn't actually show whether Canada has a waste problem or not, compared to other countries, because the metric breaks down.

If for instance we looked at house hold waste, Canada has a massive problem, probably one of if not the worst, both in volume and how we managed it. That would be a good figure for more Canadians to hear.

I called you a baby for how petulant you were in your argument. 

If it isn't fair to blame American consumers for industry waste, then it's also not fair to blame Canadian consumers (which is what the user I was responding to was doing)."

todayilearned,ffccu0q,t1_ffc8j7t,1579796694.0,"First off, don't be a baby. 

Secondly, that's not what I said. 

Canada is over producing. We make more goods than we use. If the largest producers of waste is industry, then of course our per capital numbers would look bad. 

Canada could have the most waste efficient production of exports in the world (we probably do not) and we could still have an extremely large waste percapita number. Percapita is not a useful measure in this case, because a small population is overproducing by a large amount."
todayilearned,ffc3yq3,t1_ffc12qf,1579790956.0,"It is useful, it just breaks down at the limits. It's important to understand those things.
