AnxietyDepression,ffg7d12,t1_ffg521m,1579900037.0,You definitely can!!
AnxietyDepression,fffzf9v,t3_et7e16,1579895147.0,"Well it sounds like you’re headed for an uphill if you keep working hard. The fact that you feel like you have to keep moving helps with the having to work hard. 
 And the running is amazing!! 
I think you can keep your head up and keep going and you got this!"
AnxietyDepression,fffay0g,t3_et7e16,1579879947.0,"Idk why anyone hasn’t already commented so I will. 

First, you’re not alone. Sooo many people understand this back and forth battle with yourself. God I know I do! 

Second, you don’t always have to be stuck. Do you mind me asking what all you’ve tried to help? Like meds, yoga, mindfulness, counseling, maybe even family counseling? 

Third, I can be here for you if you need me! I’m just a message away!"
depression_help,fffa5bn,t3_et532b,1579879441.0,You said it wasn’t that big of a deal but I wanted to say I feel you! Long curly hair and depression don’t mix well. And brushing it/washing it is a LOT! So I’m really proud of you too!!! Soar on this high for a little bit! Ik you probably feel so good rn! And I’m so happy for you!
BDSMcommunity,fdos23z,t3_emh59n,1578611612.0,"One way daddy and I started was by taking the bdsm test and looking up bdsm checklists. 

Bdsm test: https://bdsmtest.org/select-mode
Bdsm checklist: http://danpetersdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CEPE-Printable-BDSM-Checklist.pdf

We didn’t actually print and fill out the checklist, we just went down the topics together and on a paper wrote “hard no, yes for sure we want to try it full force, and curious but proceed with caution”. This way we had an idea of what we wanted to get into. And we didn’t do them separately. For example, if daddy was curious about something but I said it was a hard no, it went on the hard no list. If both wanted to try something but one wanted to proceed with caution, it went on the process with caution list. That way we kept it at a spot everyone was comfortable with. 
But like the other commenter said, it’s a lot easier than you think once you start down the rabbit hole. Your own research online and talking things out could broaden your horizons. 

Also, maybe try making an account on Fetlife and finding a Domme from the city a couple hours away and possibly making a friend/mentor that way that could give you tips. We’ve also explored that as well. 

I hope this helped a little bit! And happy playing!"
BDSMcommunity,fdhgh08,t1_fdh77cn,1578422130.0,"This is how I am. My daddy says I give great blowjobs even when I’m clean but his favorite is when I get “sloppy” with it. And he has to tell me to get sloppy, or I have to think about it and remember he likes it and consciously choose to be messier with it."
shibari,fdhfump,t3_eleoot,1578421760.0,It’s beautiful!
depression,fdfrsyj,t1_fdfrmwp,1578368631.0,Man I wish I knew!!
depression,fdfjqs8,t3_el1zv9,1578363326.0,I’m glad you finally went! Holding it definitely hurts!
depression,fdfjic7,t3_el238l,1578363167.0,"I feel like. I used to draw, I used to write. They made me feel better. But not only do I feel dull and incapable now, when I try to do either they turn out shitty. It’s really disappointing."
AnxietyDepression,fdfi1c6,t1_fdfhz04,1578362175.0,Thank you!
AnxietyDepression,fdfgtkl,t3_el3gk5,1578361364.0,"I’m in it rn but we both have depression and anxiety that seem to bleed into each other. Rn mine is seemingly worse and causing lots of detriments in the relationship, per his own words too. It’s really hard. But I’m using it as motivation to get better. Because at the moment, I’m at the point where I could care less about anything. It’s all just blah to me. So without him, I wouldn’t have the motivation to move forward and get help. 

It’s all about perspective and finding the silver lining. Don’t let the issues hold either of you back, whether it be in mental illness or life in general. Instead use it to propel yourselves forward. 

Best of luck in figuring things out. It sounds like y’all have the love and definitely have the history, so just stay strong and don’t give up on each other or yourselves."
depression,fdff92p,t1_fdff6r1,1578360318.0,Thank you!!
depression,fdfdtfj,t3_el1q99,1578359352.0,"I know I don’t know you but I’m sooo stinking proud of you!! That’s so amazing! And I’m so happy for you! 
I definitely don’t have the courage to do it and probably never will so you’re way ahead of me!"
depression,fdfbk1l,t1_fde1e0x,1578357821.0,"That’s how I am right now. I had other circumstances that led to me quitting as well but I thought maybe I’d get a relief and now I’m just stuck. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, I know it’s not any fun. I hope things get better for you!"
Mindfulness,fd9p486,t3_ekah7q,1578236296.0,"I love this quote. I think it makes a lot of sense. But I still struggle with it. How exactly does one even start to do this? Because I’d love to go back to me “true self” as I was when I was a child. I was fun-loving, smart, compassionate, care-free. And I definitely got lost and shoved down under pain and world views."
AnxietyDepression,fcvrvm2,t3_ej48u4,1578008700.0,"I use mine all the time but I also keep my house pretty cold and love to cuddle in blankets so there’s that too!! 
So I think as long as it’s cold enough for a blanket you’re good. Don’t go outside in 90 degree weather and try to use it! Lol"
