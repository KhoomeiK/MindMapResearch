go back to r/conspiracy you fuckin retard lmao

edit: quoting the comment below in case it is removed:

>Yeah, it’s pretty clear that the word “wholesome” is being artificially inserted in promotion of ideas and brands on reddit. I hadn’t even heard the word in years before those subreddits just appeared one day. It’s the kind of diction you expect from Stepford, CT, which is suspiciously close to the headquarters of reddit’s parent company on Staten Island.

""i hadn't heard the word in years, and then it appeared on reddit one day! and then it's everywhere! beware wholesome content! the Wholesome Industry is alive and well, wake up sheeple!""

god, it's so rich i can't fuckin take it lmao"

Games,ff38jlp,t1_ff2y5b2,1579536220.0,"when it was introduced (by ""it"", i mean ""level scaling"" and reward systems based on it), it was a novel idea. then it became more popular, it was iterated upon and improved. then it became even more popular and adapted to fit many different style of game and I think we're all getting weary of its' pervasive presence and how games rely it on to extend (I think ""pad"" is a better word) the lifespan of the gameplay. enemies take more hits now, so they're harder! and they give armor and weapons which have higher numbers!  it's just slowing down the gameplay and giving me an inventory to manage. 

but the *n u m b e r s* they are **f u n**, they would have us believe.

it was, for a time, but now it's time for the formula and framework to evolve."
