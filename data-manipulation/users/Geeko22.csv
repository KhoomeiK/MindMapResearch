clevercomebacks,ffpobws,t1_ffplj92,1580100229.0,You're confusing a whole generation of boomers with the few who were in charge. Most boomers had little if any control over all that and certainly didn't have anything to do with it going away. They were swept along by economic forces the same way we are now. Future generations will blame us for everything that's wrong. Will you think that’s fair?
clevercomebacks,ffpjagv,t1_ffn0ieo,1580096382.0,"Exactly. It's the way it always is and probably always will be. The older generations look down on the younger, less experienced generations seeing them as entitled whiney pussies, while the younger generation resents their elders and blames them for everything that's wrong with today's world. 

The boomers rebelled against their parents' way of life seeing it as unauthentic and restrictive. They blamed them for lack of employment (all those young people and not enough jobs to go around). Blamed them for two world wars followed by Korea and Vietnam. Blamed them for the Cold War and having to practice hiding under their desks in case of nuclear attacks (lotta good that would've done). Blamed them for the wholesale destruction of the environment. 

Their parents thought what is this world coming to. We've raised a generation of spoiled brats that is unwilling to work hard and make the sacrifices we made. We had to walk barefoot to school in the snow, uphill both ways, and we were happy to have the chance to do it, etc. etc. etc."

My only experience is here in America where you use your health insurance if you have any, pay what's left out of your income, tap your savings if it's a serious illness. If you get old, disabled and unable to care for yourself you get sent to a nursing facility, which you pay for through the equity in your home. Any who live beyond that stage run out of money and go on welfare, which they're justified in doing since they paid taxes their entire working life. 

How is any of that taking money out of someone else's pocket? Or does it work differently for you."
clevercomebacks,ffoejol,t1_ffntvxe,1580076820.0,"Nah. The law of supply and demand will kick in. There will be a glut of apartments and houses for rent that were previously occupied by boomers. Rents will drop and buying an apartment complex will become less attractive to investors. They won't be able to gouge like they do now so they'll find something else to do.

Remember the housing bubble? There will be a similar rental property bubble with people desperately trying to unload all those units that no longer bring in enough rent to cover costs. Renters will be far better off than today. 

It will also be easier to buy a home with all those houses vacated by dead and dying boomers."

I'd been holding it since lunchtime and felt like I was going to burst. Every block increased my discomfort. Turns were bad, braking was worse and speed bumps were torture. I gritted my teeth and held it and held it and held it until I just couldn't anymore, and then the flood began.

I was seated all the way at the back of the bus and no one noticed at first. Then I started to cry, and my sister noticed and yelled ""He peed his pants!!!"" Of course that made everyone turn around and they all pointed and laughed.

And just then the bus came to a stop. All my pee ran forward on the floorboard under the seats, while the kids lifted their feet and shrieked ""Eeeewwwwww!!!!""

Then inevitably the bus started up again and all my pee ran backwards the length of the bus, with all the kids yelling ""Eeeewwwwww!!!"" once more.

Some parts of the shore are truly beautiful, I'm thinking of Island Beach State Park, and there are some forested areas only an hour and a half from NY city where people regularly get lost and need to be rescued. 

Then there's the Pine Barrens, which are part of a unique ecosystem dominated by dwarf pines and sand-adapted plants. It also contains many bogs with a variety of carnivorous plants like sundews and pitcher plants. Very interesting place and well worth visiting.

Once we were camping and it got lost among the leaves, never to be found again no matter how much we looked. The other time we were traveling and stopped at a gas station, and he accidentally left it in the washroom because he wanted to get his hands really clean (he'd been messing with the motor). Of course we drove away without the ring and when we rushed back to look for it it was already gone.

So I determined that if I ever got married I would never take mine off. Well, easier said than done. Turns out there are all kinds of things you have to take it off for, for instance working with certain power tools, handling chemicals, handling sticky things like bread dough, working with paint, and so on. So I've taken it off many, many times. But luckily I've never lost it (yet).

I also took it off for an extended period of time when I gained a little weight, just enough that the ring was difficult to take on and off. So I took it off ""just until I lose those 10 pounds."" Well, that never happened, in fact I gained another 10. So after doing without it for a few years I gave up and had the ring resized. But now I'm back to the problem of having to take it off periodically and hoping I don't misplace or lose it."

One of my neighbors is a runner, I see him criss-crossing town every evening and weekend, hour after hour.

Another friend is into Legos, he builds amazing models that are interesting to look at but people criticize him for the hours that go into each one. Another friend is into tropical fish, every wall in his house is lined with aquariums, even his basement and heated garage are full of fish and equipment. 

My wife knows someone who spends all her spare time quilting and she'll talk your leg off about patterns and designs and fabrics and quilting shows. Another friend wanted to be a vet but it didn't work out, so instead she owns seventeen cats, nine dogs, three horses, two llamas, a flock of free range chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys and one peacock. The animals consume all her spare time and money but she loves taking care of them and it makes her happy, and it makes her husband happy to see her be happy, so he fends off the criticism from family who think she should put all that time into a job.

Their sharp teeth can ""inject"" hard-to-treat bacteria deeply into the skin and joints, increasing the risk of serious infection. Deep puncture wounds are hard to clean, often trapping bacteria which then cause the infection. 

Dog bites cause more injuries but cat bites are more likely to become infected. Studies have shown that 50% of deep cat bites lead to infection.

Watch for pain, redness, swelling and inflammation as well as fever or chills. Get to a doctor by the very next day at the latest. Cat bites are often polymicrobial, meaning multiple species of bacteria may be involved. These can lead to serious illnesses (including tetanus), and can lead to lengthy hospitalizations or even death. 

Not something to be taken lightly, particularly with children. The good news is that a 7 to 10-day round of antibiotics will cure most cat bite infections. But left untreated they can become extremely serious, so don't delay treatment."

They are most definitely in need of charities, many of which aren't just handing out food but are actively engaged in health education, nutritional education, drilling for fresh water, working for economic development, and providing free medical care.

Saying ""I'll look it up later"" doesn’t work for me because I either forget to do it or forget what word I was supposed to look up. So I've found  the best way is to just stop and look it up NOW. It also helps me learn because I'm reading the word in context in a real-life situation."

We have five kids too, and every once in a while people will give me grief about ""harming the environment through overpopulation"". I point out that they drive fancy cars, live in a huge empty house filled with fine furniture, commute an hour each day to work and fly to far-away expensive vacations. 

We don't care about any of those things, we have different priorities. All my wife and I wanted out of life was a pile of kids. We drive ten-year old cars, take short weekend getaway vacations nearby and live a simple life in a not-very-large house. But we have a wonderful family full of fun and our home is filled with joy."
