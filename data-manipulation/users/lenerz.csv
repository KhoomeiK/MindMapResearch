AskReddit,ffxts4d,t1_ffxneyu,1580332268.0,I don't think people share just to build up a persona. I like to share just because it makes me feel good and I love showing others that I'm still alive lmao
AskReddit,ffxlm5e,t1_ffx6joy,1580327627.0,"That's not true, I care a lot about what my close friends and family post.. I love seeing traveling posts, stories about their day, I love seeing their daily activities when I'm away from them. So I disagree wholeheartedly."

xxfitness,ffx1ukx,t1_ffx0sqy,1580315950.0,"That's great, thanks :). Sounds similar to me when I was a student, but I didn't have a fitbit back then so I don't actually know how many steps I took. 

Unfortunately I already do everything you've listed above as well (except my gym is a small apartment one and doesn't have a track) so I can't incorporate much of that, but I'm going to try and keep motivating myself to walk more! Thanks for the motivation!"
xxfitness,ffx02pv,t3_evm1z5,1580314854.0,"I'm very similar in stats to you! I'm 5'4"" and currently 110-112. 

How do you manage to walk to many steps a day? Do you have a retail job or something along the sorts? I'm trying so hard to get in more steps daily, I go on walks, I go out every day for 45 mins, but sitting as part of my job prevents more walking.

I don't really know about the other things but it looks like people have given you great advice & you're doing great! Good job :)"

I think everyone second guesses something to do with their dress, whether it's style or colour or fit, etc. Just always remind yourself why you chose the dress in the first place :)"

happy,ffwibwo,t1_ffvq6yr,1580301986.0,"It's interesting to me that you think it's okay to personally attack me and ""shame"" me over what you believe to be shitty behavior but I am not allowed to anonymously write about what I consider to be shitty behaviour when those two women were publicly talking so rudely about their friend that lost weight. You feel justified to call me out personally about behavior you don't like when I didn't even call these women out or make them feel bad, something that is beneath me but not beneath you.

So let's review.

You saw my post on r/happy \> for whatever reason you decided you didn't like it, so you decided to dig through my profile history to make me out to be a bad person > you quoted r/fatlogic \> you realized I don't post anything bad there > then you decided to look up my DELETED posts to further prove to yourself I'm a bad person > then you say it's okay for you to shame shitty behavior which is hilariously ironic because that's what I was doing (anonymously to others mind you, not shaming those women to their faces as you are doing to me).

You need to reevaluate how you treat others. Not once have I ever disrespected somebody for the size of their body or tried to make them feel less than. But here you are trying to act like some sort of warrior on behalf of nothing.

Listen, I'm sorry you were so offended by my r/happy post. I'm sorry if seeing or believing others can be happy hurts you. I don't know if you're divorced, or overweight, or both, or neither, but I hope you find happiness in your life, I truly do.

You can dig and perceive me however you please if it makes you happier to believe I'm a mean person but I'm simply not, or I do my best not to be. I sure hope you can find another hobby other than stalking and devaluing people's profiles on Reddit via a post about happiness. I'm sorry if for some reason my happy moment offended you so much you decided to dig through my history and try to grasp at straws to imply I'm anything but."
