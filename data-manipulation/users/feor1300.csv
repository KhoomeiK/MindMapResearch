And that's not how Star Trek typically settles these things.

Ormus would have been a boss battle with a Tasha's death cutscene to motivate the players for phase 2 of the fight. And more besides.

The only action scene in Wrath is the space combat between the Enterprise and the Reliant. The rest of it is all verbal sparring and attmptes by Kirk & Khan to outsmart each other. Undiscovered Country has a little bit more action, But even then it's just the escape from Rura Penthe, the fight against Kang's BoP, and Scotty kicking a door in to murder an assassin. Most of the movie was the mystery of trying to uncover the conspiracy.

Best of Both Worlds: almost no action. The initial kidnapping of the captain, the first attempt to retrieve him, the ""Mr. Worf... fire!"" cliffhanger, and the the plasma spray trick to let them get Picard back proper. Maybe 10 minutes total out of the 2 hour show.

Chain of Command: not really any action at all. The closest they get is Worf and Crusher GTFOing when the trap is srpung. It's all psychological conflict between Picard and Madred.

Year of Hell: There's action, but it falls into the ""backdrop"" classification. The focus of the episode is figuring out how to stop the time ship.

What other episodes get regular cited among the top episodes?

TNG: Measure of a Man, Drumhead, The Inner Light (Barely even a harsh word exchanged in these), Taspestry (like 30s of bar brawl), and Darmok (they fight the monster, but it's again a backdrop to a story).

DS9: Far Beyond the Stars (Benny gets roughed up by the cops a bit), The Visitor (no fighting here), In the Pale Moonlight (Sisko roughs up Garak a bit at the end), Trials and Tribbleations (one bar fight mostly played for laughs).

Voyager; Latent Image (just the Doctor fighting his own demons), Living Witness (fictional action). Voyager's got a bit of a shallower pool of episodes that show up ""regularly"", on best of lists. But still the ones that are consistent are usually pretty peaceful."

The conflicts are generally intellectual ones. People debating rather than coming to blows, and when violence does happen its the leading character's last resort (or self defense) or something happening in the background. Movies like Final Frontier, and Nemesis get lambasted for having too much conflict. Even First Contact, which is arguably the best TNG movie, often get s criticized for being too heavy on action and too light on thought.

The shows lean even further away from action as a central theme. Even in the Dominion War episodes of DS9 there was almost always some moral, philosophical, or scientific dilemma in the forefront and the fighting was a backdrop to it. *Siege of AR-558* wasn't about the Jem'hadar trying to capture a Federation position, it was about Nog getting a first hand look at how much war costs (and setting up the world beautifully for *It's Only a Paper Moon*).

Games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, or (I presume, I haven't actually played it) Red Dead generally have the resolution to the conflict being ""Find the biggest/toughest/meanest thing on the map that wants to kill you and kill it back."" which does feel far more like Star Wars or other sci-fi/sci-fan properties than Star Trek has always aspired to."

As to the capabilities of the replicator: I've always felt that the replicator is perfectly capable of recreating something it was programmed with with perfect accuracy. And the problem is that it recreates it with perfect accuracy. You order stake #13 from the replicator and it's a perfect, juicy, delicious, amazingly well marbled piece of meat that is the most delicious thing you've ever tasted. And you order it again and it's exactly as good, and again and it's exactly the same and again and it starts to get boring because it still tastes exactly the same.

Real cooking has a bit of variety to it, a little bit of extra sugar, a little bit of extra fat, a different brand of spices, etc. But the replicator works in atoms, not ingredients.

So if the deuterium stops, or there's enough helium to get in the way of the deuterium hitting each other, the reaction (and thus the reactor) will stop.

So you still have to manufacture or refine deuterium, ship it to where your fusion reactor is if you're not making it on site (which, I admit, you probably could in the age of replicators) and store it ready to be fed to the reactor (even with replicators you'd want a few hours of buffer available in case the replicator failed).

It doesn't get terribly screwy, it just really paints the Vulcan Science Council in a bad light, since the Countdown Comic showed Nero taking Spock to them shortly after learning about the explosion, debating the point with them long enough that Nero was getting nervous and left to go and at least evacuate his crew's families, he gets back to Romulus minutes too late (he was able to watch the planet be destroyed), and then the Council relents and gives Spock the red matter and he's only days behind Nero.

So the intention is clearly there that the supernova was still far more widespread than *just* the Romulus system. I'd have to re-check the book itself but I'm pretty sure they even name drop Hobus specifically.
