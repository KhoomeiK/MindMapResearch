TalesFromRetail,fekezsk,t3_epkqap,1579198657.0,"I worked at one of those open air shopping centers, where you are right on the kinda road and there is parking on both sides. Someone came in and asked if anyone left a dog in a car across the street. It was no one in my store, and they asked a bunch of others, to no avail. It was well over 90°F, no trees or shade to be seen, and the windows barely cracked. We were all freaking out over the poor overheated-looking Golden.

Luckily, there are cops around, and one of them parked their cruiser right behind the car so they couldn't get out. He was checking the windows when this woman crossed the street and walked to the car, totally oblivious of the cop. He confronted her with her door already open. We couldn't hear what the cop said, but you could tell he was beyond pissed and was dressing her down big-time. She eventually got to leave with the dog.

With no traffic I can get to West Medford in 30 minutes, but like there is ever not going to be traffic on 93. South of the city may be better, as a lot of my coworkers live out that way, but I can’t vouch for that as the South Shore is only something I pass on the way to the Cape."

This was before I had a GPS, I was unfamiliar with the area, and no one told me wear we were going, so I was driving fast and loose to keep up with the other two cars.

Lesson there: I don’t trust used car shopping with just me and my mom as the checkers. We know enough to be dangerous. I drove a car for 11 years and didn’t even know it didn’t have an oil dipstick. 

I will have to take your word on how easy the brakes would be. I can do little things, but so far not much more. I just know what the dealership is quoting is about the same as a mortgage payment. 

This will be my second set of new tires, not counting the one that evil curb killed 3 months after I got the car. I think I found a good set of all-season tires that will work. The ratings on all the categories were 9 out of 10 or better. 

I am saving this comment specifically for the battery info. I hate when car companies seemingly intentionally use odd sized, unique, and inevitably expensive parts. My mom had a cheap ass Gep Prizm that had weirdly sized like Tonka Truck tiny tires that were stupidly expensive for something so small. 

Eventually I would like something with AWD that isn’t the size of a Mack truck, like an HR-V or a Subaru, since I live in Massachusetts and don’t want to get stuck in a snow bank or slide sideways like that bus did the other day. 

Thanks again for all your info and help. While I love a nice car, I really don’t know much, and YouTube can only help so much. It did help me change the headlights on my incredibly user-unfriendly Cavalier."
