AskReddit,fg1pxz5,t3_ew5y15,1580431511.0,"During my freshman year of college there was a pretty massive wind storm that came through the area and knocked out power to the city and surrounding towns for a while, as well as causing some significant damage with downing trees onto property.

At the time I was going to college in a college town 10 or so minutes outside of a major city. I happened to be talking to a girl I met on tinder at the time who was very unique to say the least. She was a Wiccan and a cam girl which was a weird combination to my previously sheltered self. I get a message from her once the storm had really hit explaining that she was stuck in the major city because she had taken the bus in for some groceries, but the bus service stopped once the storm got too bad. I was one of the only people with a vehicle that she knew they could come and get her.

So I go out and pick her up and bring her back into our college town, thinking that it was a nice thing to do and hey maybe it would score me some brownie points. On the way back we came across a tree that had fallen on to a car on the side of the road. I got out to check what was going on when I saw several people around the car. Turns out there was an older woman stuck in the driver's side who was having trouble breath ok ng from internal injuries. Paramedics were 10-15 minutes out because they were backed up with other accidents from the storm. Me and another guy there ended up pulling her from the wreck and carrying her up to the side of the road and stabilizing her there. (As a side note my ability to handle this situation later helped me realize that I wanted to go into some sort of emergency response career, which lead me to getting my degree in criminal justice)

Paramedics arrive and I get back into my truck and head out with the girl I had picked up. We get back to the college and park in one of the upper parking lots to one of the dorms and end up talking in the truck for several hours. The conversation eventually gets sexual, and at one point she goes

""Yeah I have like absolutely no gag reflex""

Before I can think of a follow up comment to make to that she goes

""Here I'll show you, for you have a pen?""

I gave her a confused look and handed her a BIC pen and watched her proceed to hold it by the very top and sword-swallower-esque swallow the whole thing, including her fingers down to her knuckles, and hold it there for about 15 seconds before pulling it back out. That was one of the most simultaneously confused and aroused I had ever been.

She pretty quickly ends up doing that to more than just the pen, which I certainly wasn't complaining about. After we mess around for a bit longer in the truck I walk her back to her dorm and wish her a good night. It should be noted at this point that it's gotten pretty late so since around the accident onwards it's been very dark out.

I get back to my dorm and meet up with my friends in a common area on our floor. As soon as they see me they start freaking out because ""why were you gone so long we thought something had happened to you, why do you look like that, are you okay, what happened??""
I had explained why I was leaving in ng earlier and had told them I'd probably be gone a few hours, and had been gone more like 5. I tell them about the accident and what had happened after, and my phone had died halfway through the night so I hadn't been able to update them. Then it fully clicks what they said and I go

""Wait why do I look like what?""

They tell me to look at myself because I'm covered in blood. I look down and realize that my shirt and jeans are covered in the women's blood from the car accident when I pulled her out of the car. Neither I nor the girl I was giving a ride had noticed it because it had been so dark. But I realized that I had sat like that for a few hours while talking in the truck, and then gotten a very enthusiastic and thorough blow job while covered in this other women's blood.

So yeah take from that what you will it was probably the single craziest thing to happen to me during college, and that was fall quarter of freshman year. What a way to kick off college."

Half the time I can't tell if my emotions and thoughts are valid and I'm just being dumb for over analyzing them, and the other half of the time I can't tell if I'm completely irrational"

Select male target. Preferably someone who was once a friend that you now harbor ill will towards. Must be in a committed relationship.

Make preparations before their significant other is arriving back at their home (bonus points if its from a long trip).

Create fake profile on facebook of an attractive female, stealing a selection of pics from someone no one in friend group would know. Create arbitrary posts and friend people within friend group slowly over several months to build credibility of profile. Comment on posts, like statuses, hold conversations as necessary.

Spend time with target several times over a few weeks. Acquire access to phone. Set up fake conversations alluding to liaisons between target and fake profile made on Facebook. Stagger over several instances for authenticity. Hide conversation to avoid discovery by target.

Rub slight streak of lipstick on inner collar of a shirt and waistband of boxers. Spray cheap perfume in air and waft shirt through it. Waft panties through it as well. Streak foundation lightly on center of sheets. Mess sheets up, add perfume as needed. Tuck shirt messed up hanging out of hamper within eye sight. Use condom (by yourself or with another). Tie off and leave at top of garbage can in view. Crumple panties, tuck against bed as if forgotten there. Lay boxers out in a used and more obvious location.

Await arrival of target's significant other. Message target's significant other with fake profile, ""confessing"" to having slept with target on multiple occasions but not being able to hide it from significant other any further.

After initial discovery of evidence and explosive confrontation, post on target's facebook page and fake profiles own page outing the supposed liaisons between target and owner of profile. Fuel negative emotions and spread of rumors and gossip amongst friend group.

End goal: Target has suffered significant emotional trauma and psychological distress, erosion of trust between target and close friends and family members, as well as the loss of their significant other. Public web history potentially leads to job opportunity losses on account of questions surrounding target's moral fiber."
