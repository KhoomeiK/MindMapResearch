PublicFreakout,ffidcyz,t1_ffibkvs,1579971184.0,Maybe duck duck go I have heard other people talk about it but never used it myself. And bring okay but usually I have to scroll down cause the first few results are not what I'm looking for either that or the results I get from bing will be outdated by a few years
modernwarfare,ffe5l9n,t1_ffcgmql,1579837297.0,Seriously everyone panics with the gas comes out and runs away instead of just staying. Hell idk how many times I run into my own gas grenade and still manage to get kills lol
modernwarfare,ffe599g,t3_estpy2,1579837045.0,"So the best way I found to counter gas is to just sit in it for about two seconds after that you can ADS there's a slight movement slowdown but not as bad of a slowdown as with the stun.

This is helpful for maps that has something to duck behind in the objective. For example in shoothouse playing headquarters and the point is in the corner of shanty town when I get hit with the gas I duck behind the barrels for a couple of seconds and then I can pop up and shoot back normally. If you're lucky the time not just completely rushing you so the person who threw the gas can't rush you just yet or else they themselves will be stun and by that time you will already be able to ADS."
