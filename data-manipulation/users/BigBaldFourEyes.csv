They had to make changes mid stream, and the crazy result shows lack of forethought and inability to adapt.  I have done stuff like this before. Not gonna lie. But you learn from it."

aww,feplrp7,t1_fepft5p,1579323850.0,"Damn onions.  Sorry for your loss.  We’ve had to put down two Shih Tzus over the years.  We said goodbye 11 years ago to 14 year old Bodhi because of liver failure, there was nothing we could do.  And 2 years ago we lost our 18 and a half year old sweet baby Dharma, who kept on as long as she could.  Toward the end we’d come home every day to a mess in the kitchen where she had some free space.  Never scolded her, but you knew she felt bad.  On a happier note, we currently are owned by 2 year old Loki and 5 year old Sashi.  Would do anything for them."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fd00c53,t3_ejirpd,1578111710.0,"A group of about five of us in high school would have a back and forth with our homeroom teacher, and rib each other occasionally.  He would lovingly call us a bunch of dirtbags.  We would make references to “those who can’t do, teach.”  Anyway, one day my wise ass self says, “Mr. Brown, you’re an English teacher. Why can’t you come up with anything other than ‘dirtbags’?”  It took him a half a second to shoot back, “Go sit down and shut up, you truculent buffoons.”  I had to look up ‘truculent,’ but I already kind of got the idea of its connotation in this context.  He was a hard ass, but a good teacher."
