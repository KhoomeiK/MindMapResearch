BlackPeopleTwitter,ff2zeam,t1_fez2qt9,1579529455.0,"I'm not saying you a bad parent. I'm saying you make poor financial decisions. You defended you ability to buy coffee every day. Even if you are getting $1 gas station coffee that's still roughly 3x the cost of making your own at home. If you are getting dunkin or starbucks that is about 15x the cost of making it at home. Your boss had a point and its ridiculous that most users here cant seem to understand that budgeting actually helps and buying frivolous things such as coffee every day really puts you at a financial disadvantage.

You stated you were making roughly $12 an hour. If you are working 40 hour weeks you earn $480 before taxes every week. And $24,960 a year (again before taxes). If you are buying starbucks or dunkin every day, you are spending roughly $1,825 a year on coffee alone (~$5x365). Making coffee at home costs roughly 30 cents a cup. Or $108 a year on homemade coffee.  Once again you have to be ignorant to not understand the total savings you can make on coffee alone, which is why it tends to be people's first suggestion when it comes to finances."
