videos,ffcbdtj,t1_ffc22rp,1579795788.0,"In today's day and age, they generally manifest as sound bites engineered by think tanks, but double speak is a fairly all encompassing term for deceit through language. This can include labels (Obamacare, death panels) which are meant to color your first impression of something. It can include nicknames like Shillery and Obummer, often found spread online. It can be tag lines like saying ""drain the swamp"" while hiring nothing but oil exec's and swamp creatures. It can also be more fluid, instinctual responses to questions on the fly that mischaracterize through positive or suggestive word choices. It can be the sterilization of terms or the exact opposite. Shell shock becomes PTSD, planned parenthood becomes abortion clinics becomes baby murderers. 

In all seriousness, you have to develop an ear for it, and you'll meet a lot of people who never do, in much the same way that a lot of people fall for scammers and snake oil salesmen who you may find suspicious immediately. If you don't know you're being manipulated, it's easy to feel the way the double speak wants to you feel: mollified, enraged, scared, dismissive. Regardless of the content, word choice and tone can make it obvious how a speaker or author wants you to feel about their words. If you can see that, dig past the tone, and judge the content and the sources of that content for yourself. And if it doesn't match, ask yourself why they are pushing that agenda."

Turns out she was in a 6+ year long relationship with her high school sweetheart, went to college together, were thinking of moving in together, etc. Furthermore, their sex life was great, he was attractive and attentive, had a good job, etc. Literally living the fuckin dream. Like... fairytale status life. Until she gets it in her head that she's never been with anyone else, and wants to try some other dicks before settling down with her guy forever. So she TELLS HIM THAT, to his face, and proceeds to travel through Europe by herself, leaving him back in the states. They stayed in touch for the first month, but hadn't talked in over a month by the time I met her. 
Now get this - by the time I'd met her, she hadn't so much as kissed anyone else. She'd never dated anyone else, had no idea how to be single, and hadn't actually followed through with her goal of fucking a bunch of Euro trash (my interpretation). But her boyfriend didn't know that, and wouldn't believe her if she told him that (also my interpretation). As far as I know, she never ended up sleeping with anyone her whole trip.

So this girl, with the perfect, childhood friend turned boyfriend storybook life, tells her bf she wants to try other dick, leaves for Europe, never actually tries any other dick, and most likely loses boyfriend in the process. Insanity. She was so oblivious she didn't even understand how awful what she was doing would be for her dude. Like...

I've met a girl who tried to convince me that absolutely 0 girls, the world over, enjoy giving blowjobs. Couldn't be swayed otherwise. I've had a girlfriend who's nipples and clit were completely numb, and did nothing for her, and my very next girlfriend could orgasm over and over, and after getting her nipples pierced, could literally orgasm from them. She also taught herself how to deepthroat on me, and loved it. She could orgasm internally and externally, but a lot of the girls I've met who can't cum from penetrative sex don't believe it's possible for anyone. 
And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Choking, erogenous zones, sensitivity... the female body has an absolutely wild variance, and every guy you sleep with is working with outdated data.
