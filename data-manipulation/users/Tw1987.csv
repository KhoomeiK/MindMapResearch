With that said in my plan going to the doctor would not have an affect on the situation if there was a mistake on their end.

If you blindly agreed to everything and accidentally clicked the wrong benefit and signed off on it then it is your own fault and your employer most likely won’t change it if there was nothing wrong on their end. 

If there was something wrong on their end then yes they may retro (not guaranteed but why would they risk any lawsuit in our wonder litigious state) with refunds or whatever you owe to the EE portion of the benefit.

As for the doctor  in theory they will charge you for the copayment upfront on the current plan you are enrolled in and depending on when they bill it it may be correct if your Ben admin and if they bill in February or if they bill it immediately then it would go with the plan you have now and corrections may be adjusted later for proper cost.

A lot of scenarios but main point is you going to the doctor will not affect their choice. They don’t care and the only who does is the one in charge of your hospitals bills and coverage."

Edit: also everything is in Japanese so it adds a bit to the entertainment. Also if you are a Disney snob make sure to get Tokyo only shit like their popcorn buckets and Tokyo only ears so you can wear them at other parks and get compliments from Disney cast who never seen them before.

With that said treat her like a normal employee when it comes to work performance. Bring her into your office with her supervisor and let her k ow she’s not performing. If she uses pregnancy as an excuse(which it can be) let her know that it would be unfair to other employees to treat her differently when it comes to performance. 

Give her the options with the most common one being intermittent FMLA which is what we did. She got a doctors note etc... She was a 40 hour workers but she’s been averaging 24-32 hours a week.
