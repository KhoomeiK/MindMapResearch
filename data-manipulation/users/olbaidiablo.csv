And I actually enjoy spending time with her, we have intelligent conversations, travel... We went on a road trip involved 12-16 hours in a car for days at a time and not one argument. Not one. If we have a disagreement, we talk it out and work it out, no screaming, no bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with it... We discuss. No stress and it's wonderful."

I'm not saying my wife doesn't do her fair share, she does, but we have an unwritten rule. If it's dirty clean it.

canada,ffce47u,t1_ffc6605,1579797493.0,"I know the stats. But I'll tell you the reality, there are few jobs here that aren't minimum wage, you NEED a car to get a job (due to the terrible public transport options), and unless you want to be kicking heroin addicts off your front lawn you aren't getting a rental unit under $1000/month. 
Maybe Riverside drive's millionaires are messing with the average, I don't know, but that's the reality.
The problem with the stats is they are assuming many things. We still have a lot of electric baseboard heat in some areas which is prohibitively expensive, needing an extra car, along with the terrible roads (causing damage to said car), the fact that we use salt exclusively (also causing damage to the car), insurance rates are quite high as well. 
Also, saying it's the most affordable doesn't make it actually affordable. The unit below me was recently vacant, and people moved in, they are paying $1350 a month. That's 2 weeks pay for me. I'm in the trades and while I don't have an amazing job I would say I have a decent job."
