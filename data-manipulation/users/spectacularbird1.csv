thewestwing,ff7qq4a,t3_erymnw,1579656051.0,I always just assumed he was the father of Margret’s baby. In my mind they had a hot and heavy affair that just never panned out in the long term. There’s a moment in a later episode where Josh mentions not knowing that Margret is married and everyone kinda gives him a look and that was the indication that everyone sorta knew about the affair with Bruno but didn’t want to mention the potentially  messy break up that happened with Bruno went to work for Vinnick.
