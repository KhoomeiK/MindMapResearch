Christianity,femzy51,t3_eq0rb8,1579273854.0,"This reminds me of a scene in the Netflix special The Tudors.  In one scene, Henry the VIII needed to masturbate. So he had to have some poor servant catch his “seed” on a little velvet pillow. I guess he figured as long as it was not “spilled” he was alright with god.  

The fact it’s called “seed” illustrates the author didn’t understand what it was to begin with.  It’s exactly half of what people need to create human life.  It’s not planted into women like they are dirt or a vessel.  And you make plenty of it.  Holding it back is not good for your prostate and l would hope you don’t wish to create a baby every time you “let it fly”, for all of our sakes.  

Bottom line for me is you will drive yourself crazy trying to shoehorn your behavior into what the Bible says or what people try to tell you what it says.  It’s okay to apply to apply a little common sense and modern morality to the situation."
