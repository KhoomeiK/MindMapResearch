I found that just the indoor smell could trigger my nausea and make it so much harder to control. Also, make sure to stand up when eating and walk around. Helps with digestion.

Also, deep breaths. And don't wear too tight clothing either. You need to be as relaxed as possible. And don't lie down right after eating. Wait at least an hour, otherwise your stomach will just slow down digestion even more.

Take care. I promise, it won't last forever."

Det eneste man har fokus på i dag i både gymnasierne og folkeskolen for den sags skyld er at udvide pensum konstant, men at man skal lære det på halv så kort tid. Det giver ikke tid nok til at eleverne ordentligt kan få sat sig ind i stoffet. I stedet bliver det for overfladisk, og man når knap nok at færdiggøre et emne, før man hurtigt er videre til næste kapitel.

Ingen når at fatte, hvad det lige var de lærte om, og for at gøre ondt værre, så indførte man CAS-værktøjer, sådan at man kunne suse igennem opgaverne endnu hurtigere. Det blev så på bekostning af repetition og basale matematiske færdigheder.

Hvis eleverne på nogen måde skal forbedre deres basale matematiske færdigheder, så skal der altså trækkes i håndbremsen med mængden af stof eleverne skal igennem en hel skolegang. Der skal være mere tid til fordybelse og være mindre fokus på at proppe flere overflødige emner ind i undervisningen.

pregnant,fei9kp4,t1_fei66pq,1579133342.0,"Nope. Water didn't break, but as the baby grows in there, the body absorbs the fluid over time and so does the baby, if it stays in there for too long (which is why he had fluid in his lungs). 

My body just wouldn't start producing oxytocin to start the labor, for some reason. Instead of just spitting out the rest of the water that was left in there and essentially jumpstarting the labor, my body just decided to sort of keep my son and everything else inside. 

That's basically what happens, when a pregnancy goes on for too long. The fluid is supposed to protect the baby during birth, but when you reach closer to week 42, the fluid becomes less and less and increases the risk of complications during labor. 

My body should not have kept my son inside for so long, because it was literally beginning to harm him. He would most likely have died, if I haven't been induced. That's why it's best to give birth around week 40.

So they did and he was out 16 hours later. And the birth was tough not only to me but to my son as well. He was hospitalized for a week after due to thick, amniotic fluid caught up in his lungs.

Induction should be an option for medical reasons, but otherwise I don't think you should just do ""it"" because you think it's easier. It's not. Induced labor is fucking painful. The contractions are horrible. There is no way to manage the pain and you generally just push your body into something that it doesn't want to do.

pregnant,fei29ew,t1_feh54q3,1579128696.0,"Can confirm. I was induced. Those contractions was horrible. I've never experienced something so painful. I could not find a way to ""work"" with those pains. It was impossible. I've been told by many women that they didn't understand how I could think it was so painful, because they thought themselves that it was managable. Well, let me tell you... being induced is definitely not managable."
pregnant,fei1onv,t1_fegp166,1579128346.0,"Yes, this. Where I live (Denmark) they will not even consider induction until you've reached 41+5. But at the same time they recommend that the pregnancy should have finished at 42+0."
Denmark,fei0m0l,t3_ep20ho,1579127694.0,"Der er desværre nok en stigma omkring, at mandlige pædagoger skal være ekstra påpasselige, men jeg synes personligt at det er fuldkommen latterligt. Der mangler så mange mandlige pædagoger i børnehaver rundt omkring, og det siger jeg som mor til en 2-årig, der snart skal starte i én selv. 

Jeg bliver kun glad, når jeg ser børnehaver med mandlige pædagoger løbe rundt på legepladsen og tager sig godt af børnene. Jeg synes det er synd, at det er blevet så udpræget et ""kvinde-domineret"" fag."

LifeProTips,fegqecj,t3_ep1zjv,1579100081.0,"I don't understand why so many people are getting angry at OP for just asking people to be on time. It's literally a reason for layoff in many working places, so why shouldn't people be able to attend a meeting on time as well?

Also, to many people being late by a few minutes is considered being lazy. An example, at one of the schools I attended a few years ago, the teachers would lock the classroom door on exact time the class started, and anybody who wasn't there on time, would be locked out until next lesson.

Just saying."
