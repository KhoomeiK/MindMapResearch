It's really stressful when you prepare food for your kid and they don't eat it, I can't imagine how much worse it would be if you can barely afford the food to start with.

Add to that that fact that you can provide for their kid what they can't, and how this must make them feel, and knowing that this is why their kid is suddenly rejecting their food. That must truly be awful for them.

While it's true that the electricity use should have gone down for the month while she wasn't there, this seems like a super petty and unusual request, and as your friends have said, the house still has underlying costs irrespective of if there is 1 or 2 people there (refrigeration, lights, heating or cooling). Also 6 months later? Lol. 

If she were able to work out how much the electricity usage had gone down in the month that she was away I think it would be reasonable to deduct that from her bill, but it would definitely sour the relationship for me that she even asked.

FDIL is completely within her rights to turn down this dress, if it's not what she wants.
