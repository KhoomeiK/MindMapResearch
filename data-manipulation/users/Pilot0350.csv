Remember any panda housing will work so if I were you I would buy the purple pandas and just keep the purple stems to mod other switches later. Could be kind of fun. The other nice thing about purple pandas is that the housing is more of a dark gray than black and I think it looks really cool with Halo clears but I also have ice pandas which use the blue panda housing. Next up, mints and reds for me!

USMC,fdlxhi2,t3_elv18v,1578534843.0,And by monster and mountain dew you mean ripits
MechanicalKeyboards,fdln2jm,t3_d589zk,1578527754.0,"Yeah I never got around to writing a full review but I'd say they really aren't bad and feel quite satisfying. The tactile feel is no different than Halo clears as a side by side comparison will show the bump is nearly identical. 

Where the difference lies is how long the stem is. The purple stems are shorter than Halo clears by the tip of the stem where it becomes more narrow. This means the purples don't bottom out like Halos do in the panda housing being either good or had depending on what you're looking for. 

If you like the satisfaction of the thoc sound in holy pandas then these won't satisfy as they are a bit more silent. If you're looking for a silentish holy panda but with the same feel then these are perfect for you.

Overall if holy pandas are a 10/10 I'd give these purple pandas 7/10.

The switches I have and use in my keyboards are: (all lubed appropriately and I have only metal and wood boards)

Cherry Browns - 2/10
Cherry Clears - 4/10
Aqua Zilents - 9/10
Zealio 65g - 8/10 
Holy Ice Pandas - 10/10
Purple Pandas - 7/10
Hako Clears - 7/10
NK/Kailh Box Heavy Burnt Orange - 5/10
Gateron Greens (clicky) - 7/10
Box Jades (clicky) - 9/10

Hope this helps. 

Conclusion: For the price they are pretty nice but left me missing the sound of holys."
