BeAmazed,ffgxc78,t1_ffgv8nt,1579917457.0,That's pretty extreme calling someone's opinions disgusting. I'm most likely more qualified than you to make assumptions. Keep smoking your weed 24/7 and let the ones who have real power makes the decisions. People like you are the reason democracy doesn't work. People like you who voted for people like Trump. Without a thought of consequences or complex processes to determine choice. Just always go with your gut right? Pathetic.
funny,ffgnj12,t1_ffg67b5,1579910380.0,"This is a mostly private account and I'd rather not go into specifics but I found people uppity, shallow and ignorant of how meaningless their possessions are. It's so sad."
BeAmazed,ffgn3x4,t1_ffgd82q,1579910092.0,"Please don't take this wrong, but when I'm thinking top notch education I'm talking about the eastern seaboard mostly."
BeAmazed,ffg3ylz,t1_ffg16s7,1579897944.0,Going to school in China is not considered good news to anyone educated in the outside world. That kid is not getting what he deserves. He should have been sent to Europe or North America. Then he'd have a chance at something really special.
WTF,ffg1uv6,t1_ffel1fk,1579896646.0,"No, he's right. You're just too kind hearted to see reality. It's ok, we need people like you to be mindless drones."
WTF,ffg1qqt,t1_ffeesi9,1579896575.0,"This. Why is the world getting filled with dumbasses? Helmets, safety belts, safety this, safety that. Lack of a world war...etc...

We need a major natural culling of the human race. I'm serious. To many people living that should otherwise be dead. Worst thing is, they're breeding."
facepalm,ffg0ko4,t3_et9clf,1579895855.0,"Hey OP, that's what his job is for. Why are you facepalming a reporter who's job it is to inform ignorant people like you? So what if he showed up just as there was a lockdown. Reporters brave shit all over the world in times of crisis so idiots like you can gawk at what's happening. So, grow up."
China,fffzx7w,t3_etfex9,1579895457.0,"I see you've travelled to Vietnam and Hawaii recently, what do you do for a living?"
funny,fffx0ha,t3_etdt1s,1579893653.0,Ugh...Dubai. The douchiest of places. So happy I don't do business there anymore.
funny,fffwua8,t3_etehog,1579893546.0,"Man, I'd take that doll and put it in weird places staring at where people usually sit. Then blame it on the doll and freak my whole family out.

Good times."
China,fffwjyw,t3_etexf7,1579893364.0,"Don't avoid conflict, this is how people evolve into better people. Learning other people's points of view and growing yours.

Besides. We know who's right...amirite?"
BeAmazed,fffw0f7,t3_ete294,1579893022.0,"If you want your daughter to learn to lose in life this isn't the way. Looks cute, works short term. Then when she has emotional problems when losing at school because she thinks she wins  all the time, then you're in for 25 years of 'I'm a fuckin princess' until some poor fuck marries her.

Fuck that. People need to lose to learn to win."
China,fffvdeh,t3_etdxdz,1579892618.0,"Live in Montreal. Can attest that many, many Chinese travel here, wouldn't be surprised if we have a few cases I the coming weeks.

Also OP, can you provide a translation if you're going to write in Chinese, thanks!"
RedDeadOnline,fffuslk,t3_etd6zt,1579892256.0,Well done sir. (Pardon the pun)
westworld,fffukl6,t3_ete7hp,1579892119.0,Still? I would think they'd be in post prod by now. Show airs in less than 2 months.
China,fffufyh,t3_etcx32,1579892037.0,She seems like a cunt to me.
RedDeadOnline,fffu1sc,t1_ffforcn,1579891793.0,Spoken by someone who's posts are mostly whiny little complaints no one cares about...huh fatty?

facepalm,fffhs8t,t3_et85ze,1579884250.0,"I trust me over doctors. Today patients can know more about the disease than the doctors. Downvote me all you want but eventually AI will be diagnosing people, doctors will be obsolete."
BeAmazed,fffhbz6,t1_fffdzn4,1579883966.0,Russians and Slavs always flex like their some kind of superior race. Which is why they used doping in the Olympics and they're banned. My adopted family's Russian so I know.
RedDeadOnline,fffh1m6,t1_ffffbii,1579883789.0,"Another little whiny baby. If you were my kid I'd beat you. Then I'd smash that console in front of you, take a photo, and send it to R* and they'd put it up on their lunch board so everyone can look at baby crying. 

Whiny bitch."
RedDeadOnline,ffff4jo,t1_fffd8rr,1579882601.0,"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaawaaaaaaaaaaaa.....

I hear a baby whining...."
BeAmazed,fffeqk0,t1_fffba8b,1579882356.0,"Actually IQ has nothing to do with it. Know many people as kids who wrote and spoke more than 5 languages. In most parts of Europe people speak at least 3 languages. 

Also, IQ is culturally biased and not representative of success or real intelligence, that's been debunked for more than 2 decades now. Even when I got tested I scored a 187 and I found it was bullshit."
BeAmazed,fffehwb,t1_fffbgom,1579882201.0,"Well, so much for that. Poor kid."
BeAmazed,fffegtm,t3_etb291,1579882183.0,"Yeah, this kid should get a higher education. This is amazing. Thanks for sharing."
RedDeadOnline,fffduoh,t3_etaw0s,1579881785.0,"Spoken like a noob. The only reason low levels are being constantly killed is because that's what they do instead of collecting, hunting etc...

Don't complain. Also. It's a game. Don't like it? Play Minecraft."
WTF,fffda1r,t3_eta3nm,1579881426.0,I'm order for fingerprints to work on these there needs to be blood circulation. This is faked as a joke...
BeAmazed,fffd4dg,t3_et9xo9,1579881324.0,"My condolences, however, I would never let that person operate on me. Is it some weird Russian or Slavic flex? Wtf?"
DesignPorn,fffd0z8,t3_et9fpl,1579881264.0,I've seen this before. It's a design that originated in the Art Deco period for font lettering.
blackmagicfuckery,fffak43,t3_et4jsu,1579879705.0,"It's called practice, skill and a little chance. Not BMF...."
nextfuckinglevel,fffaf9k,t3_et4pbq,1579879619.0,Hunters have been doing this for decades. Even saw it in a tv show called northern exposure from the 1990's.
cooperatives,fff9whe,t1_ffdicpl,1579879280.0,"It's called capitalism. To those who don't feel they make enough money. Go back to school, invent something,  be original. 

If robots can eventually replace your you're worth as little as them. We're human beings, not robots. Act like one. Take some initiative. The only people deserving of real money are those who's decisions have an impact on the company's profit margin, those who do routine work are just slaves. They should be paid like slaves then. Don't like it? Quit."
RedDeadOnline,ffeifjv,t3_et615c,1579849294.0,Instant classic.
AbruptChaos,ffea1he,t3_et4dvw,1579840873.0,Is this chaos though? Abrupt chaos is about many thinks going on in almost a chain reaction right? This is just windy.
facepalm,ffe9wwu,t3_esznat,1579840764.0,Someone didn't design this. It's the wrong faucet head on the faucet assembly.
China,ffe9ta6,t3_essy0l,1579840679.0,"When you say outdate or inaccurate information on the net do you mean in western media or in China?

Is what your doing legal in China?"
China,ffe99kc,t3_et4jzl,1579840218.0,That's a shitty tip. What's wrong with you?
RedDeadOnline,ffe8bv2,t3_et44re,1579839451.0,"First off, how the heck do you know their Chinese? Do they speak in some Asian dialect? Do their names end up being like Imchinese231? Do they tell you in some Asian accent that your western crap and you'll burn in the fires of shame?

How do you know?"

news,ffdvwq8,t3_esuqkc,1579830242.0,I saw this coming 2 months ago when the tv version of the Watchmen started. Looked at the clock online and felt it should probably be moved.
apple,ffdvomq,t1_ffca5hj,1579830081.0,I believe location data is still being tabulated but it's stored rather than sent to Apple.
entertainment,ffdqy9k,t3_eswlu8,1579826790.0,How about we teach adults this first.
China,ffdozsl,t3_et22g4,1579825557.0,"I was banned in Sino sub also and they told me to go bitch on western subs. Sino is NOT the official Chinese sub, this is.

R/Sino is filled with people who drink the CCP coolaid and filled with agents."
China,ffdogok,t3_eswtfa,1579825224.0,I'd safely bet that the CCP is developing viruses in the event it feels it should use them. Considering the outbreaks that happen almost every decade from China. I wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to make a virus that affects European ancestry and not Chinese ancestry. This is why we eventually have to invade China. Liberate the people and give them the tools to govern themselves.
funk,ffdo4db,t3_esxwjd,1579825018.0,"This is so far from funk that Beethoven has symphonies that closer emulate funk.

I'm getting so tired of people posting bands that have one funk song so they assume all the rest is funk. Learn to differentiate people, please.

Where are the mods? If people have to constantly report shitposts then what's the point of mods?"

That's life. Many decisions we make are not for our own good but trying to prove something to ourselves and others. It's called human nature."
RayDonovan,ffasyf5,t1_ffahts2,1579743762.0,I'd say this...OP may be too young to know people evolve over time.
RedDeadOnline,ffasqsl,t1_ffafmfd,1579743625.0,I don't feel bad for saying what I said and personally you're a douche for even mentioning that your parents died in the comment. Who the fuck says shit like that as a retaliation? Only tards do. That's who. It's like saying I have cancer so give me a free pass...
