selfharm,ffhbqmf,t3_etm1mu,1579929104.0,"I personally have tried to divert my urges into things more productive and less harmful, namely guitar and photography. Usually I get urges later at night, so I pick up my guitar and play for a while or draw or make some sort of art instead of cutting. Really anything that's not detrimental. I also recommend downloading an app called ""I Am Sober"" so you are able to interact with people trying to stop self harm as well. Someone on reddit actually recommended it to me and I thought it was just some bs app, but I got it and it definitely does help at least a little (I recommend trying it out either way). Other than getting professional help (idk your situation so it may not be possible), that's really all I have to suggest. 

I will tell you, even using both of these mechanisms as combatants it is still hard sometimes. Don't expect to just instantly not want to sh. It takes a while to completely recover, just like any addiction. Good luck with this op, and my dms are always open if you need to talk :)"

teenagers,ffhavrc,t1_ffh7obc,1579928277.0,definitely didn't seem like a joke to me
teenagers,ffhaolv,t1_ffhag0v,1579928091.0,"I know how to take a joke. I don't fucking joke about suicide because I've sat down and almost killed myself before. Also another word of advice: you can't tell some people to stop crying and enjoy life, because they can't. You telling me I have an ego for not finding suicide funny is probably one of the most fucked up things I could think of. Just because you aren't going through shit doesn't mean that other people aren't. Sit down and open your fucking eyes."
teenagers,ffh9xnl,t1_ffh9vyx,1579927406.0,is suicide funny to you

depression_memes,ffh9mqy,t1_ffh9for,1579927130.0,Yeah but Ebola was known about before the big outbreak. All the scientist dudes know about this is that it's in the coronavirus family and not much else *unless they're lying to us and theres no free death*

selfharm,ffgbufb,t3_etgoc7,1579902796.0,"I'll give you my opinion. Although I still believe sh is definitely  not good, I personally think it is a better coping method than drugs or alcohol. Both can have potentially permanent and life threatening outcomes, but I would honestly rather have scars scattered around my body than a missing jaw or some other crazy shit that results from drug addictions. Sh may physically appear to have more harm on your body, but in the long term drugs and alcohol I believe are a lot worse.

Also, sh addictions are looked down upon by the majority of people, whereas addictions to drugs or alcohol are the norm. I feel like people only think this way because you can see what sh does to you, whereas you barely ever see the results of someone with bad drug or alcohol addictions. I wish people would open their eyes."
selfharm,ffg8tu7,t1_ffg883v,1579900944.0,"I totally get it. I've only told one person, my best friend who is the only person in the world I trust. Besides her, I would be the last person anyone I know would expect to sh. It's totally acceptable to talk openly to people online about it. It's kind of like compensating for not telling anyone irl. I think a lot of people on these types of subs are in the same situation as us.  
Strangers you'll never meet irl aren't in a good position at all to judge you, which makes it a lot easier to be open online."
selfharm,ffg7y5v,t3_ete47k,1579900404.0,"I have the underlying feeling that I cut for attention, but I know I don't and it's one of the things I 100% don't want people to know about me. But honestly even if it is for attention, it's still a cry for help and is still as serious as cutting for any other reason."
