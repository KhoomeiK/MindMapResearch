AskReddit,ff506tz,t3_erj9ln,1579576724.0,"There's no one right answer. Flirting is highly individualistic, it's all about figuring out a method that compliments your personality and engages another person.

Practically speaking flirting is just sexually-charged playfulness. You're having fun with a person while the two of you are vibing off of each other. That's a mistake most people make with flirting: They think it's how you sexually-charge a person, but it just isn't. Flirting is how you nurture and stroke what's already there, until the two of you are so horny and happy that you have to fuck.

So, the real advice: Figure out what parts of your personality charm other people. People are weird, so you definitely have some quality that someone will like. First you talk to them normally and without expectation, bringing out that charming aspect of yourself, then if they start to become receptive you make the conversation a little funny and a little dirty, and coax them into doing the same.

You'll fail a lot. Some people just aren't going to be into you, and there's nothing you can do about that. Don't take it personally and just move on until you find someone who's into it."

Oregon was a couple of years later, when some dumbass ranchers in the area tried to start a forest fire to cover up their illegal poaching, then when they were arrested Y'all Qaeda showed up and took over a bird sanctuary for no reason.

Consumer demand drove prices down, and corporate greed reduced the quality of flights across the board to recover/inflate those profits. Consumers didn't consciously consent to this, they just didn't have another option as it became an industry-wide practice.

AskReddit,fdw8aqw,t1_fds7toa,1578756093.0,"GameFreak is kind of reaching the natural conclusion to some editorial decisions they made a while ago. After Gen 4 they started boiling out the parts of the game players found boring/irritating, and now that they've pursued this for 4 generations they've either done all they can or done too much. There's pretty much no grind to Pokemon anymore, if you play straight through Sw/Sh you end up comfortably over-leveled for every challenge (I averaged about 7-10 levels above NPCs throughout the game).

GameFreak is also weirdly stubborn about certain gameplay mechanics. They introduced mega evolutions in Gen 6 and everybody loved them, but instead of just carrying mega evolutions over GF insists on creating a new, similar mechanic in each new game. Stuff like Z-Moves and Dynamax are basically just Mega Evolutions with longer, unskippable animation sequences and irritating additions."
AskReddit,fdrl9pr,t1_fdrfogb,1578686168.0,"There's a lot of histrionics surrounding the latest Pokemon game. Some of it is justified, but most of it is just over-dramatic 14 year olds angry that their thing changed.

Basically Pokemon Sword & Shield had about half the usual development time of a Pokemon title, and it kind of shows. It's still a very good game, just underwhelming for a few reasons. Incomplete-feeling content, very similar to past titles in spite of now being on a platform that's 100x more powerful, and it's easily the glitchiest Pokemon game since Red/Blue. People almost immediately found multiple very simple exploits to reroll raid dens, for example.

A lot of that is a common heartache for Pokemon fans, GameFreak has always been hyper-cautious with changing up the games, but this feels like they just didn't have the time they needed to polish their content.

Also the whole Dexit mess, which is the source of most of the histrionics. Basically GameFreak chose to only include about 430ish pokemon in this game's pokedex, whereas all previous games would let you import every previous pokemon ever made up until that generation. There are now over 800 distinct pokemon designs though, so it's getting to be unwieldy/game breaking (my opinion, anyway)."
pokemon,fdqli3k,t3_emb347,1578669534.0,"That's how I'm approaching this too. As cool as it is to receive a polished, ""perfect version"" of the game a year later, it's also an undeniable pain in the ass that involves replaying a bunch of content you've already experienced. I almost always cheated on those games too, using IR and later GPS trades to give my character an invincible, late-game team very early in the story.

Here's hoping that the expansions fold in some revisions/updates to existing game mechanics too. My wishlist:

* Make raid dens more random, so they're not just the same 3-4 pokemon over and over.
* Streamline the battle system for raids, so you don't get redundant messages when multiple characters are hit/faint in the same round.
* Fix raids so damage is fairly applied, as opposed to that thing that happens now where your damage is nerfed so the dynamax pokemon can spam another shield before its health gets too low.
* My fondest wish: Allow us to skip dynamax cutscenes. It's not that they're not cool... it's just that they become boring and repetitive when you have to watch them over and over."
pokemon,fdqkk7r,t1_fdpr846,1578668907.0,"Austin John Plays on Youtube had an entire video about this. Bullets, for the lazy:

* You can't reroll it into a shiny.
* Pure Psychic type. By contrast non-Galarian Slowpokes are Water/Psychic.
* You can level it to 100 and it won't evolve.
* It learns a few moves that Slowpoke previously didn't learn, but nothing particularly interesting. Stuff like Psych Up and Heal Pulse.

So overall GameFreak gave us a Pokemon that provides very few clues for its evolution. If I had to guess Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking probably have their own unique dual-typings, because GF seems really into that this generation."

AskReddit,fdooe43,t3_em9zpk,1578609298.0,"Jimmy Dore - Started as a podcast way back in 2007 and was legitimately one of the best political roundtables of the Bush administration, then he pivoted to video in like 2012. It was pretty good to start, smaller panel but still a workers-first examination of current issues (which, unfortunately, were still very lacking during the Obama admin).

Jimmy was super pro-Bernie and, even if he wasn't always the best-informed person, he recognized the problems and chose the right side. Then Hillary won the nomination in 2016, and Jimmy went *fucking nuts*. Dummy nuts. And when Trump won the election that just confirmed every ragegasm Jimmy had in 2016, so he doubled-down.

I'm very liberal, so neutrality wasn't the problem, I think it's stupid to demand your news be completely neutral anyway. It was just Jimmy's glaring lack of acumin over what he was talking about, coupled with his show just devolving into him screaming the exact same talking points into his mic again and again, that made the show unwatchable.

When a dumb person finds out they're right about something they just become insufferable. In this case Jimmy was right that the 2016 Democratic primary was unfairly stacked in Hillary's favor. But if one dumb thought is validated then, to them, all of their dumb ideas are validated, no matter how baseless. You see it with Trump, you see it with Fox News, and you saw it with Jimmy Dore. Blegh."

I think it would have been cool if they had made Ballonlea and Glimwood Tangle the same map. Maybe get rid of the arbitrary darkness in Glimwood, and instead make Ballonlea this weird, spread-out city that's built into the forest itself. Fairy pokemon sneaking all over, creepy lights hanging in the trees, tons of patches of tall grass, but then every so often you stumble into a little copse of houses. Eventually you reach a big clearing with the gym, but it's not a traditional stadium and instead more of a rustic/creepy thing."
