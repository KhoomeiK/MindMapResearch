The finished product is on the box and probably online as well. They’re not like other puzzles ex: Rubik’s cube because there’s so many ways you can solve one, but on a jigsaw puzzle you spend hours at a time putting the picture together, then what? You disassemble it and probably won’t ever touch it again."
