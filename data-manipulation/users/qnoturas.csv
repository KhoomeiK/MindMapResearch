Wellthatsucks,feyf2lm,t1_fextcjv,1579444634.0,I think what I love about this reply is that you have the same level of hatred for a manager and job that happened 12 years ago. My coworker and I still talk about a job we were both stuck in in 2004.

Seems like Soleimani was a target for years even before Trump for the killing of American soldiers and innocent people in the name of terrorism. This wasn‚Äôt a split decision made by the Trump Administration which is what the media wants us all to believe.  I think if the R was magically a D next to Trump‚Äôs name, he would be celebrated as a hero like Obama with Bin Laden"

From there i started panicking more and more in stores and shops because I didn‚Äôt want to panic in front of strangers. I went into deep depression and stayed home because I didn‚Äôt want to panic. Then I started panicking because I didn‚Äôt want my wife to know I was panicking. Hugely cyclical. 

Decided to go out not because of thinking ahead but because I didn‚Äôt want to let my wife down.  After a few years walking around the same shops I was panicking in, I still have the feeling of uneasiness but it is something I can tell my stupid brain to shut the fuck up about and enjoy the moment. 

Anyway....."
