Property taxes?? You can't be serious!  Walt had about six months to a year left. You know how long it takes the government to foreclose on land? And then, **after** foreclosing, there is usually a redemption period of several months before they can even evict. And even then, they ain't checking IDs. The sheriff or court office would just show up and go, ""You! Out!""
