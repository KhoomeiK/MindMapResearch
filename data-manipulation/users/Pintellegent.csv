Bowling,febici5,t3_eo9e6a,1578959144.0,"There Needs to be a one lane courtesy for everyone’s safety not so much to allow people to focus, during open play. One bowler on that lane, unless dad is helping or special needs.. it is no play to play. Behind the approach, at the seating area or the apron above, act like animals. On the approach, no. If your neighbor doesn’t know about one lane courtesy, I just bowl when they are walking back from a shot, cuz they’ll run up on you when the ball comes back or their next bowler will. They don’t want to learn courtesy, they will act offended.."

This guy is a rapist of children, and all he can do is call him a fagot because he thinks it’s more insulting than calling him a child rapist..  sexually assaulting a 7 year old is horrible, not being gay. I wrote this before reading all the comments, and yes the topic is hit..  heterosexual men and women hold the attitude that gay men will assault children because heterosexual men do and they think gays are sicker and grosser than they are, that’s all.."

We just gotta video ourselves and be brutally honest w ourselves...   any coach will, look at a video take a question and make comments.
