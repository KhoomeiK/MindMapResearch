And he isn't the only one who posits the Ashkenazi intelligence theory as an explanation for Jewish success.

I don't see how they're necessarily very different, in sociology, they're both components of a group's identity, racial being greater than ethnic: Japanese and Chinese are Asian, Germanic and Latin are European; think of it like group and sub-group. 

As for your second point. Leftists typically don't oppose ethnic identity unless it's too salient, as it could lead to pride and/or nationalism. But it all depends on who's being asked. They're more likley to allow more ""underrepresented"" groups more of this than a dominant one. But why can't that afforded to both? Is it acceptable for a white person to identify as white if every other group can identify as x? How is it even the ""dominant culture"" at that point if the dominant identity can't be positively affirmed? You'd think positive affirmation would be implied and non-controversial. 

As for assimilation, some do, but many increasingly don't. The idea of immigrants assimilating used to be near-universal. But agreeing upon the rules and the rule of law seems more prevalent among them under some circumstances. Generally, you can't have two different groups co-existing if they don't agree upon the basic rules, at least not for long. This manifests(even subconsciously) more often when the degree of differentiation is accentuated by a civilizational clash. For example, muslims can't fully practise their religion under a liberal system if that practice is defined by following quranic instruction, it would be a mutual exclusion.
