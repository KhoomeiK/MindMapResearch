todayilearned,ffu6n26,t1_ffu5jrl,1580235604.0,"The most powerful power of the people's tribune was the veto, which is fine for preventing the government from actively shitting on the plebs, but it doesn't get them positive social boons like guards in their districts to curtail theft or things like that. The people's Tribunes can also introduce legislation, but that's all really up to the Senate. Plus it's one guy. Chances are you're going to need buckets of money raised by people with similar interests to get anything notable done for your community."

Since the lower classes in Rome didn't have any real say in governing their own affairs, they organized into these social clubs that advocated for their particular interests, whether it was local businessmen, crooked businessmen or artisans. My favorite is the Collegium Lupanariorum, the Pimp's Guild."
