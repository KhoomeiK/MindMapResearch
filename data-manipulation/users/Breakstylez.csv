Dads,ffg6sno,t3_ete3m2,1579899686.0,"Because guys can be pieces of shit and take advantage of women. When guys get drunk, we prank each other. It's not as bad of a situation. he just really cares and you didn't tell him where you were and didn't openly share as you said you guys usually did so I get it as a new father of a little girl. If you're staying in his house, grounding can still be a thing. I understand you're coming in to your own but a 19 year old is usually one of the dumbest, most confident ages we go through. You should work out a system where if you're going to drink, you can still be in touch with your dad without him being overbearing. Keep that trust but still enjoy your freedom. you should apologize to him and again, work out a system where you're both happy. He just cares about you is all :-)"

For a bumper with taillight and paint job on my old Acura, $2,600. The taillight is about $400 from the dealership so you can figure out the rest and I think  that white was custom also as I've never seen a white Lotus stock and it also had a lip kit on it=$$$$"

HumansBeingBros,fdhpfm0,t3_eld1y1,1578427538.0,"My daughter also does this but either in the cart or in my or my wife's arms. Stores a little too crazy for her to be running around like that. If somebody comes out of nowhere and hits her with a cart, I'm gonna freak out and technically it would probably be my fault for letting her walk around in such a way so I don't play that game. Also, I joke around and tell her white people don't wave back haha. My wife and I are white. We would go to the mall and let her walk in areas where there are almost no people but when we would hold her, she would wave at people and almost no white people waved back. Weird. a black dude who looked stoned out of his mind gave her the warmest smile and waved back and I looked at my wife and was like, ""see""?? lol."

Upset or not (I'm sure I'll talk shiet) we will be there, you have to make sure you give us the chance to help though. We can't help if we don't know ad we ALWAYS want you to tell us when you need it. Glad you're ok, maybe question your choice in BF if he's putting you in situations like this often. This type of story shouldn't happen more than one to someone :-)"

AmItheAsshole,fckhh5v,t1_fckgdif,1577725430.0,"WEDDING GIFT. SHE DID NOT PURCHASE A RING FOR ME. This isn't me bitching about a Christmas gift so your whole ""reciprocity"" theory is null and void. She did not buy my ring so we agreed she would get me a watch. This was 2 years after we've been married and she makes more than enough money to buy what I want and what I want (which she finally ordered) is only $150 which is very inexpensive for a ""dress watch"". Wedding gifts ARE entitlements, would you agree? That's literally part of the whole marriage gig, right? Would you marry someone and not get them a ring?"

AmItheAsshole,fckesxb,t1_fckdieq,1577723726.0,"You're focusing one a single perspective action instead of the whole situation. I have no issue with being wrong but you're picking an angle and coming across holier-than thou IMO. You're not taking my feelings or perspective in to consideration at all. You've no mention as to how my feelings are considered and the fact that this is supposed to be a wedding gift also which should merit a little more thought in to the gift AND the fact that I specifically showed her what I wanted and she wasn't considerate enough of my  feelings to even remember or pay attention in the first place. so again, I'm not opposed to being TA, I just don't think you're taking the whole scenario in to your response. And if it's taking too much of your precious time to  respond, then don't. Have a Happy New Year!"
