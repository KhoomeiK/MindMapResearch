Smite,fglc9sk,t1_fglaqo0,1580890472.0,The old design makes her look more like an assassin. She's a warrior.
WTF,fgl37fs,t3_eyx19x,1580880596.0,I hope she still doesn't live like that.. Cats aren't fucking chickens you just throw food at
pokemon,fgfduzs,t1_fgfc1mu,1580735747.0,He's one of my least favorite Pokémon lines. It's a goddamn apple dragon.
todayilearned,fgf6swv,t1_fgemdz9,1580727562.0,You know absolutely nothing about me bitch
pokemon,fgbwq03,t1_fgauvky,1580666794.0,"Reasons
1. Recycled game models from 3ds on a home console for console price
2. Blatantly lied to us about reason 1
3. Totally terrible Pokémon designs
4. Another shitty gimic(gigantamax)
5. Lazy region design.
6. The game isn't even half of what it's predecessors were.
7. DC adding the rest of the game for 30 more dollars. 

Pokémon has degraded totally and you're wrong if you disagree. Period."

pokemon,fg8g7y1,t1_fg79aca,1580618559.0,Idk why either but everytime I see Gen 8 pokemon I puke a little in my mouth
todayilearned,fg7hf9n,t1_fg7gs9l,1580592591.0,OK boomer
todayilearned,fg6va3u,t1_fg69knm,1580577689.0,It's almost like college in America is a scam itself
Smite,ffsamat,t1_ffrs0p4,1580177180.0,I disagree whole heartedly. I find rushing bancroffs is better for the sustain you get. Then CD boots and then a doomorb if you don't have to get antiheal. If antiheal is needed I'll get doomorb after I get estaff.
Smite,ffrb3yp,t1_ffr6jh1,1580154366.0,Quick tip from a Thoth main. It feels much better starting off with straight up t2 bancroffs instead of mage bless and boots. You out poke practically everyone from the start if you can land your 1s.
BeAmazed,ffniwvz,t3_eu60d0,1580066508.0,Walter and Jesse need to know this location

Smite,femytwq,t3_epxy1b,1579273089.0,Hera has always been wonky. I'm pretty sure all her abilities don't quite hit right. But nothing will change. Same with chaacs ax throw his aoe hits outside of target area.
shittyfoodporn,femxvhp,t1_femtn6d,1579272431.0,Everyone's fat as fuck
pokemon,felplnv,t1_fel5c2p,1579227848.0,Pokemon has really degraded..
pokemon,fejogpl,t3_epchxn,1579181629.0,Is the right one real?..
Smite,fe8s56q,t1_fe8psml,1578930089.0,I mean I dropped 50 bucks back in summer sale 2016 for the limited Bacchus bearly buzzed skin.. You had to buy like 5 other skins to unlock it. I don't really like zeus so I probably won't get this tbh. Maybe if the skin was for a better God.
Smite,fe8mqld,t3_enxz85,1578928032.0,I'm confused. I already have the God pack where I get all the future Gods and shit. What is this gonna give me and for how much?
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fe6dduz,t3_enqddx,1578887630.0,Why chastise the mother about knowing what the child is doing? She was driving. And why send 6 patrols out like that? I feel like the whole last part of the post is irrelevant
todayilearned,fe1oab4,t3_enk8hu,1578828993.0,I become more and more disappointed with humanity everyday
Smite,fdxqchm,t1_fdpq1oz,1578771769.0,"As a support you shouldn't rush a damage item like that. If you wanna deal a little more dmg build more bruiser items, stone of binding for example."
pokemon,fdvx9vm,t3_en2zcz,1578752759.0,I read your wall. 90>80. Why would anyone think it's okay to pay 60 dollars for copy and pasted 3ds game models and software and then 30 dollars more for the rest of the game? All this DLC should have been in the game from the very beginning for 60 dollars. Period.
ATBGE,fdpn7vn,t1_fdpmgco,1578633482.0,Her lips look like cuts of beef. She's asking if vegans would still kiss them.
pokemon,fdpmr42,t3_emaxzv,1578633052.0,I won't waste my time on a 90 dollar 3ds game but yall do you
pokemon,fdpjrya,t3_emb347,1578630541.0,"They copy pasted game models and software and charged $60 for a $40 game on a HOME CONSOL, NOT 3DS, and now this new dlc making you pay even more makes it better? Lol"
WTF,fcyjbv5,t3_ejcxd0,1578081014.0,Very helpful. Thank you so much.
