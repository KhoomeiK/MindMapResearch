history,ff6g3dj,t3_erx3uv,1579626440.0,"Very short answer: they knew who was who on the battlefield, mostly.

Individual coats of arms were known, comparable to football-club logos today. Not everybody will be able to tell them apart but most soccer players will know a lot of them.
Medieval European battles were also usually a lot smaller than you might think, and certainly a lot smaller than most battles earlier in Roman times, or later Napoleonic and modern battles, due to feudalism and the nature of armies under feudalism.

Another factor is that medieval hand-to-hand combat was generally not a random brawl with opposing troops scattered and mixed all over the battlefield. Troops operated in units that had formations, usually a line or a block. All the men to your left and right are your comrades, all the men in the opposing line or other unit are your enemies.

Lastly the composition of medieval European armies, although varying vastly from one to the other, was often something in the order of ten percent knights and their professional soldiers, ten percent mercenaries, and eighty percent levied peasants from the various knights holdings.
This meant that the men in the units had a good chance of having known each other for years.

AskReddit,ff6dxf9,t1_ff6dfa2,1579625092.0,"You googled ""distance to horizon at sea level""?



Weird result. I'm right though.





The distance you can see to the horizon (in kilometres) is 3.57 times the square root of your height above sea level (in metres). So:

at 1 metre above sea level you can see 3.57 km

at 4 metres above sea level you can see 7.14 km

at 100 metres above sea level you can see 35.7 km

Actually at sea level the distance to the horizon is zero: effectively, there is no horizon unless you are observing from above sea level. At 1 centimetre above sea level, you can see 357 metres."
