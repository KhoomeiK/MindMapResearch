TwoXChromosomes,ffw4eva,t3_evixzw,1580283853.0,"You shouldn't feel ashamed of an STI. Would you feel ashamed for contacting strep throat or the common cold? People get those bugs repeatedly. Just because your junk's involved doesn't make it any more wrong. Stuff happens. Antibiotics exist, and you got screened (good for you, well done, some people feel too much guilt and shame to deal with the issue) and you took care of business. Alas, we live in Puritanville where a lot of people are judgy as fuck about all things sexual. 

I don't have any particular dog in this race, but I want to say I do find it distressing when people refer to being STI free as being 'clean.' Cause it implies people who do have or have had STI's are dirty. It's a shitty cultural quirk that perpetuates stigma, and I'm guessing this is an unconscious part of the overall shame package you're carrying around with you. You should let it go. You are a person with worth, even if you've had strep throat. Twice.  :)
