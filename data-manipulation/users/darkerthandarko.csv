subnautica,ffglfgu,t1_ffgaq43,1579908952.0,Holy shit this is a thing?!? Everyone always calls me weird for hating stuff in the water and being freaked out by it. I also don't like things in pools either..like the big animals or big tree trunks that are plastic but partly in water.. nope nope nope I don't even like thinking about it
AskReddit,ffgarpe,t1_ffg1tta,1579902139.0,Kid in my middle school snorted a kool-aid packet during lunch!! Ended up over the trashcans just fucking dying until some teachers were like wtf is going on? He said it burned so sooooooo bad
AskReddit,fevkkoc,t1_fevfqvy,1579398495.0,That is what happens to me!! And it's fucking terrifying. It really feels like you're going to die from suffocation. I don't like sleeping after those episodes either. Shit feels so real..

Growing up when I would stay at my grandma's,  she had a lot of old items, not necessarily family items either. She had a bunch of old hats and one of them always gave me a bad vibe. But I wasn't powerful enough to connect with that energy, nor did I want to. But I always had the weirdest dreams/nightmares in that room, no where else, would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like a million eyes were just on me, watching intently. My grandma also says when I was little little (I don't remember this) I would always tell her there were ghosts in the living room and sometimes they watched us. She took it in good humor. But I do remember one night late, everyone asleep, the tv in the living room just turned on. I was terrified lol"
interestingasfuck,fe38pad,t1_fe2x3d6,1578847003.0,I wonder how many of those people have ever self reflected or thought about their existence or had any form of thought.. I'd bet none. It is so scary
interestingasfuck,fe38etl,t1_fe32tfn,1578846905.0,"Exactly. Think if instead of focusing on a piece of paper we say has value, humanity invested in the betterment of all living lives? Including the Earth itself?? We could be so advanced, no one hungry, species of animals thriving, actually focusing on life, on living. It depresses me I live in a world controlled by dimwit fucktards that make everything about money and also hoard the money, watching everyone else fight over themselves, some Hunger Games type shit. Why are things this way? They could be so so different.."
politics,fdhynak,t1_fdhweqy,1578432550.0,And I fucking love that I have to pay into it. Can we revolt already?? How are these stupid fucking people controlling things?? And doing whatever the fuck they want. AHHHH
antiwork,fdhy4lx,t1_fca152b,1578432275.0,"And that motherfucker still charges hundreds of dollars for his office program that IS USED EVERYWHERE. Fucking blows my mind lol 'but he's a good guy, look at how nice and good he is' Population control ideas from an elite rich, that is the fucking sad future we face"
Paranormal,fdhxfd4,t1_fdhmud9,1578431908.0,"Fucking creepy as hell!! I'm so glad you solved this though and hopefully that spirit will finally leave you and your family alone. Was the guy who helped you via internet or did you physically meet him? If he did it via internet that is amazing, he has incredible skill, to be able to access that realm without seeing or feeling the location of the spirit, I wish I could do that lol"
antiwork,fdho83u,t1_fdh1pyr,1578426819.0,"Same. Or a plague for just humans. We are the worst, most destructive species on this planet. Time for us to go"
