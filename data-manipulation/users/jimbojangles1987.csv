Also, incidentally, I went to the gym last night and the treadmill I was using had a TV that was set to whatever channel The Phantom Menace was on so instead of listening to music I just watched about 30 minutes of it. Got there just in time to hear about midichlorians and watch some podracing."
AskMen,ffhzpmn,t1_fffhav4,1579960551.0,I completely disagree. It was one of the best shows for a long time up until those last couple seasons. I am still extremely grateful I got to watch it up until then and I think most people would enjoy it just like i did.
