Best you can do is to come next time and don't do the bad stuff you were commented on during the last session. Not always possible but can't know if you won't try. It is the best form not to repeat the same errors. All depends on how badly you want it.

Also, ask what awaits you in a near future. You want to know where you are at and what is upcoming. Don't be coy with this question, just tell him as is. You just want to see a forward path for yourself.

I'd also ask about stuff you read or seen on youtube about bowling. You don't know any better, you need some bullshit filter and use your teacher for that, let him tell you what is what.

Bowling,ff95bd6,t3_es2hon,1579705194.0,"Now, to get better you need to:

1) Learn how to find the where to throw to get strikes

2) For #1 you need to be consistent (repeatable) from throw to throw, so you could test results of one throw vs another.

3) Again, #2. Must be super, super consistent. This will help you with strike count. Approach, speed, swing, release, they should be a mirror copy of each other from throw to throw, zero deviation.

4) Spares, having closed frames (no pins left standing) counts. It brings you to a higher score. Just closing 1 additional frame can give you about 10 more points to a score. Also, as you get better at hitting pins, you'll see that you will start generally leave 1 or 2 clustered pins that are easier to pickup than 5 or 4 spread out ones."

Bowling,ff6jzmt,t3_erxk27,1579628827.0,"Physically impossible. A fast moving ball has a momentum. Hook happens because of friction acts on a ball. If a ball has a momentum, it will go through friction like it was oil, small to no hook, out of bounds (OB). Thus, if you want to play faster, you need to play straighter, or slow down for exaggerated hook.

The spin should be matched to the speed, I think it is 3 to 1 to be optimal (spin speed is the circumference speed matched to forward ball speed). Yet, if the ball skids out, no amount of revs will help. Revs engage when a ball encounters friction, if it skids, revs never engage (grab, bite, etc).

Think, if you move extreme left and throw fast, your ball will get in the gutter 15+ mph after sliding through all the center oil. What is going to stop such a projectile? Even the backend might not be enough.

The rule is, as you step left, you slow down more and more, unless you want to hit the 10 pin or gutter. Finesse is everything, brute force is nothing when hooking. On shorter patterns, however, there is more friction area, speed can be upped.

So, the moral is, don't play for looks, play for lane conditions.

Yes, at times you want to launch that ball down the lane at 20mph+. But, you chose here, do you play to throw a ball fast or do you play elegantly to lane conditions for score? Can't have both. At times I throw fast to get it out of my system but I do it with a plastic ball on spares. Pick your battles."

Basically, removing even tiniest and low chance problems from affecting such an expensive trip and contributing to a loss. Say, swimmers win by a 1000's of a second. Bowlers win by a pin. If you put so much into the trip, why not make everything just so perfect in hope to score all possible pins by having an oil-less grip.

Yet, overall, each one said that it makes no difference in how the ball reacts. Yet, if the ball comes back with an oil track and you have to hold it, if you have $ on the line, it is a no-brainer to wipe it. But if you are having fun, it is more anal retentive than immediately helpful."

Basically, bowlers get to know how they like their inserts. There is nothing like finishing it to perfection yourself. I heard that the pros get their balls drilled, then take them to the hotel room and finish them themselves to their preference with tools they bring themselves.

And again, pro shops do the minimum required job if you don't give them explicit directions. Don't wait for them to finish the inserts how you like without giving them instructions. Plus, adding a better finish at home doesn't hurt. Many proshops don't have a very high grit paper anyway."

Trained with plastic ball on spares (plastic ball was chosen to eliminate hooking while re-learning landing a ball). Kind of double training, loft and spares at the same time. When I was able to land the ball without much noise, I upped the speed bit by bit. You have to find that most efficient arc where the ball has most smooth landing. Though, this arc might differ some when you ramp up speed later, but you get the idea.

What I found, if you won't slow down, you can't build a new muscle memory. Loft is a form of a bad habit, it takes time to remove it. Speed reduction and concentration is a key. And prepare yourself that this is not immediate, it is a process that will take time.

I have 2 teachers and either one was telling me that lofting is not generally a problem if you loft consistently similarly. It is inconsistent loft that adds/removes random new friction that will act on the ball even if you play the same path.
