You have to be damn lucky to get that many - you generally book one of about 50 auditions, and let me tell you, that ""about"" is an average, and for every job you book right booking another, you wait through 200 auditions before landing your next. Last commercial I got paid me a grand total of about $2800 for both the day of shooting and the six-week run. 

First one I ever did paid me a flat non-union $500, and lololol it's still in use years later but there ain't shit I can do to get a cut of that."
TranslationStudies,ffhhd1q,t1_ffhafh4,1579935291.0,"It's not a group per se - it's like a discount pool on proz.com; there's a Translator Group Buy page. You sign up with a group of other translators to get the software at a discount. If enough people sign up and fill that group list, the discount is triggered and everyone gets it.

You're supposed to pay right away, since signing up = agreeing to pay, but there are standby lists if the group is full, so if someone backs out, the next standby on the list is notified.

I don't remember what my MemoQ discount was, but I do get regular Trados promo emails and have seen them advertise 35% - 45% off between Black Friday and today. So definitely don't get Trados with anything less than a 35% or 40% discount. MemoQ discount history is something you can Google or search on the proz forums.

I paid around $700 the first time I got two Trados licenses, and just over $600 for MemoQ (because I needed that one asap and couldn't wait for a discount. I've seen better discounts this year).

But, again, the agency versions of MemoQ comes with a number of licenses they can temporarily grant translators who don't yet have the software - don't buy *anything* unless the lack of software is stopping you from getting work."

They do in fact have metric fucktons of evidence, and it's all been posted and is publicly available. Interviews, depositions, statements, emails, text messages, notes, everything.

Also, the specific reason these proceedings needed to happen *right fucking now* without waiting for a court to take months to decide is because we are in an election year and *the whole point of these proceedings is that Trump was abusing his office in order to force a win in 2020*.

Let the situation languish for months and thus cast *massive* doubt on the 2020 results? Risk even more polarization and likely riots, risk malicious foreign election influence, risk showing this president that he can do whatever he wants and remain in power?

Please try to follow both sides of the argument instead of listening to just one.

Also, please remember that these people are out to save themselves. Pelosi and the Democrats would be royally screwed in 2020 if they impeached the president for anything but serious abuse of office. If they had no evidence, they'd be reviled by over half the country, and they'd load both the presidency and the House in 2020. They KNOW this. Pelosi has survived in Congress this long. She won't risk every scrap of power the Democrats have, just on the off chance they can get Trump out of office a few months early. 

But they do have the evidence. We've seen it. That's why Trump's losing in every head-to-head matchup poll with all the leading Democratic candidates.

fatlogic,ffhe10m,t3_etg8n6,1579931435.0,"tbh this is why it pisses me off so much that subs like ProED were banned, and why people IMMEDIATELY start worrying about eating disorders if someone drops down towards the lower end of their healthy weight.  It's absurd and completely ostracizes people with EDs by making them completely unacceptable to talk about in case other people get ""infected"".  Imagine telling someone they weren't allowed to talk about the awful parts of their depression, share stories, or get help coping if they aren't ready to work their asses off to get their mental disorder under control just yet. Imagine banning and vilifying BPD communities because teenagers might be influenced. 

Imagine telling someone with suicidal thoughts that they aren't allowed to talk about their feelings publicly UNLESS they're actively working to overcome those thoughts.

This absolute bullshit way of viewing EDs may allow companies to look good in the media, because Tumblr can say they're doing their part by linking help warnings and hotlines any time someone searches tags like ""skinny"", but  it is actually incredibly dangerous. It's telling people who are *mentally ill* that they need to shut up and go away until they're ready to get better, because the world needs to watch out for people who haven't been infected yet. If you've already got the dreaded ED virus? Fuck you, your body and all your thoughts and feelings until you've decided to get over yourself!

I don't like thinking about how many deaths and close calls were caused or hastened by this cruel forced loneliness. But I wonder about that every time I see one of those dumbass generic warnings, or see a stupid worried Reddit comment directed at someone who's mentioned their weight and their 1200cal/day diet but has not said a word about any mental anguish, or when people's personal Tumblrs and subs like ProED and proedmemes got banned.

It's so terribly sad to see taglines like ""not promoting EDs, this is just about how I feel, please don't delete"" at the top of people's Tumblrs. ""Please don't delete the only place I can somewhat freely talk about the crazy shit happening in my brain"", is what that means.

TranslationStudies,ffh7ndw,t1_ffgnqvm,1579925421.0,"I recommend looking at MemoQ first - in my experience, that's what primarily gets used to synchronize games across a team of translators and editors. The agency/company may let you use one of their licenses when you're working for them - plus, compared to Trados (if you're going to buy) it's way more worthwhile, because upgrades are free.

Take a LOT of photos and *videos* of your dad. And of yourself, if you have HD. If it's emotionally possible for you, leave your child with videos of you having fun with him, you being the real you with him and pulling dumb pranks/teaching him your favorite hobby/anything with your face, your thoughts, you saying how proud you are of him, even conversations directly to camera that he can watch when he's older. My boyfriend's biggest heartbreak is that he never got to have an adult relationship with his ""real"" father, and over the past 15 years he's forgotten a lot about who his dad used to be.

Atlanta,ff7muc4,t1_ff79qj6,1579653324.0,"Yeah, I know they use code names and NDAs and all that, but in this case the title Ghost Draft was not justvplastered all over location signs; when I looked it up initially, that's what it was called on IMDB and in various other press releases, with well-known cast members linked and everything. It wasn't a code name as far as I can tell; this was a change. Add to that - a week or so ago when they were back shooting at the Marta station, the names on location signs now all read ""Tomorrow War"" - actually thought it was weird that a different movie would use exactly the same location, but nope; the synopsis is the same.

The synopses - again, it was weird. There were two. Yes, both were on legitimate sites and looked like standard production press release material. One was pretty much just like the one in this thread; the other was really overdramatic and very ""The Earth is under attack. Only one man can save it - by raising soldiers from the dead. But can he do it without raising THE GHOSTS OF HIS PAST?"" (duhn-duhn-duuuuuuhn)

I'm paraphrasing heavily, because I skimmed this on my phone two months ago while taking a walk, but that's the gist. It made the movie seem pretty stupid and didn't match the other synopsis at all in tone. I've never seen a lack of PR coordination like that from a big-budget movie; it was really strange.

Finally - yeah, I know this stuff takes time. But they were shooting for at least three or four weekends in October/November, setting up and tearing back down every time, then took a rather long break for over a month and started shooting again. Unless they needed to reshoot, that's weird - it seems unnecessarily expensive to do it this way. Or unless a huge chunk of the movie takes place in that one specific war-torn location around that same flipped-over tank, which is also odd.

tl;dr: I get why it seemed like I didn't know what the fuck I was talking about, but there are some legitimate oddities in that production's process."

sewing,fehhiq8,t1_feh5wxh,1579116651.0,"Honestly, we can all benefit from that; you're not alone. Doing is so much more exciting! My favorite way to self-teach is to buy couture sewing books; my next favorite is to look up couture sewing blogs. That method of lining a coat, finishing by slip-stitching the sleeve lining to the body lining while the garment is inside out, comes directly from one of my Claire Schaeffer couture books, and it's illustrated with an inside-out view of what I'm almost sure is a Dior coat. (I would check, but my cat is sitting on me, so. Foiled!)

I can't tell you how much better my work began to look once I started implementing couture techniques. The interior of a garment now always takes me way longer than the exterior, unless there's beading or embroidery, but it's so worth it. Interfacing a hem to weight it and make the edge crisp; saving organza selvedge to stabilize necklines, shoulders, etc.; when sewing on large buttons on a coat that'll bear a lot of strain, put a tiny button on the reverse side and sew both buttons together (with a thread shank for the big button) to avoid the strain eventually ripping your coat fabric...I love learning all these tricks, and they not only make garments look better but function better and feel more comfortable.

Honestly, I think it's better to learn new techniques by starting with the couture or at least designer RTW methods; that way you don't have to unlearn bad habits!

By the way, Claire Schaeffer has some couture patterns with the appropriate instructions for sale through Vogue patterns. I have her tailored pants pattern, and the 3/4 sleeve on her V8943 dress is so good that it's become my standard go-to one-piece sleeve starting point when drafting or draping a new pattern.

sewing,fefh96f,t1_feeet9c,1579056281.0,"Understitch wherever possible, and if your pattern has a dart going into a waist or armscye seam, don't sew that dart into the lining - make a pleat instead to increase ease of movement. 

If doing a coat, sew the lining and fashion fabric without the sleeves - basically, make an armless lined coat, with all shoulder pads sewn in. Then stitch the lining to the fashion fabric at 3/8"" all around the armhole. 

Then sew the sleeve fashion fabric to sleeve lining, and deal with all pressing/buttons/buttonholes/vents/decorative accents. 

Then set the fashion fabric sleeve in by hand at 5/8""(at least baste by hand even if you sew the final seam on the machine), making sure the fabric crossgrain is parallel to the floor at the very top of the sleeve cap. 

Then sew the sleeve head to the armscye seam allowance. Finally. turn the coat inside out and pin the sleeve lining in place so it hangs neatly and covers all stitching lines in the armscye. 

You should end up with a lovely fully lined coat and a lining that won't move all over the place and distort the look of the coat, because you've sewn it in place around the arms.

Finally, especially for coats, pick a slippery-feeling lining that's got a bit of weight to it - the crazy thin linings will melt/shrink under your iron in a heartbeat, and you want it to be slippery so you can easily slide your clothed sleeves inside. For, say, summer skirts, pick a lining in a natural fiber that will breathe! No one likes polyester sweat trickling down their legs. Linen or cotton are nice. But if you'll be wearing winter stockings with your skirt, I like silky/slippery. Match your lining to the purpose of the garment.

Finally, SPEND MORE TIME PRESSING THAN SEWING. Press after every single seam you sew. ALL OF THEM. Not doing this is hands-down the biggest giveaway that you're a novice.

And remember, there are endless videos and blogs that will help if you get stuck. I mean, I found a post on the perfect fabric to use for ruffled Victorian petticoats - there's an answer for pretty much every question. The Internet is awesome."

You want to see results so you first seriously cut down on food, then you overeat when you give up because you're famished. Repeat ad nauseum. 

Possibly you fall victim to idiot fad diets and pills, you spend endless money, try all the things, feel so much shame because they're not working and you know you're fat this whole time and you just hate it so much. You search for any answers, ANY, but you're too ashamed to tell anyone IRL that you're a failure, so you just look online. At some point you'll find myproana and the Tumblrs of people with EDs who are desperate for a place to vent. You think ""well, it works for them, and nothing else is working."" Slippery slope achieved.

Instead, give her all the factual information she needs, but *show her by leading by example*. She is going to feel so awful if you point out that she is fat, because that's like pushing down on someone's broken arm and saying ""wow, your arm is broken."" (*""YES THANK YOU I KNOW THAT FUCK OFF""*) But frame it as *you* knowing something is wrong with *your* habits, casually sharing *your* goals, your methods, your resources, your struggles, your ""down"" moments of failure, your achievements - if you do it right, and if you can do this without making her think that you're judging her, then you'll be someone who is in the same boat as her, and she'll be able to talk to you. Because then she's not alone.

Especially - ESPECIALLY - if you make a serious fucking effort to engage in her feelings and thoughts without saying one word about weight. Ten to one she feels extremely lonely. She needs attention, dude. Make her know right down to her very core that her happiness is more important to you than anything else, and that you'll do anything to make her feel fulfilled, confident and happy.

Also, fwiw, if she comes to you and tells you she knows she's fat and wants to fix it, or if she breaks down and screams or sobs that she hates herself for how she looks, it's probably gonna go over *really, really well* if you take responsibility for that. Tell her you are so sorry. That you should have given her better tools, given her a healthier environment, been a better role model. That it's not her fault for not magically acquiring healthier habits that she was never taught. That it is NOT hopeless, though, that it won't be easy but ty will be simple, that she's totally capable of losing the weight sustainably and that you will help give her the tools to do so. You'll also do it with her, if she wants. She doesn't have to go on walks with you if she doesn't want to, for example, but you'd really like it if she did, because walks are kinda lonely and you'd really like her company, because talking to her makes you happy.

Yeah. Make it clear to her that she's the victim of inattentive parenting here (because she kinda really is, dude), that she deserves better, and that you will do better. 

Also, counseling, if she'll go. And if you're gonna say anyone is unhealthy, might not be a bad idea to get a check-up and come back with stats of ""my doctor says I need to..."", because then it's actually about health, not about ""you're saying 'health', Dad, but what you really mean is that I look fat""."

I legitimately can't comprehend why anyone would want to believe in, serve and follow a God. I hear people saying they're all sinners and God's love is perfect, and that makes me shudder. I do not want anything to do with a parental, final authority compared to which I am a pile of shit who has to work endlessly to be worthy. I may be their creation but if I don't do what they want, I'll face a terrible future.

It sounds like an abusive parent, honestly. I love you and you are my child, have faith in me and do everything I say, defend me against everyone and use faith to defend my strictures against any holes outsiders may find, and if you reject me, even if following what I say brings you loads of pain, you are the wrongdoer, your actions hurt me and you will eventually suffer for it.

Yeah. As a child of an emotionally abusive parent, the whole concept of religion and following a God seems gross, manipulative, and wrong. It seems like just more of the same bullshit that made me miserable for decades while making my parent feel like a saint.

What was your life like at home? How did/do your parents treat you?

The whole ""this person will make everything okay"" thought process reminds me a lot of how we see our parents when we're really young, and if for whatever reason you didn't have that - like, your parents either weren't there or were emotionally disengaged, or self-absorbed, or working crazy hard and had no time for you, whatever - then it actually seems normal that you'd immediately latch on  to the first person who was nice to you in the way you needed, because on some subconscious level that's a logical way to fill that void in your heart. Then, as you clung to him because his niceness was helping you, your behavior became a habit which reinforced itself with repetition until it felt uncontrollably compulsive.

Does any of that sound right?

I recognize some of these feelings. I used to develop insane, unrequited crushes on people who I was often too scared to talk to. They'd have considered me acquaintances at best. It's so sadly obvious now that an emotionally disengaged, workaholic mother and a father 3000 miles away who rarely called were the real issues creating that pit of loneliness. It made me cling so hard to these crushes, because there I had daydreaming and happy fantasies and occasionally we'd exchange smiles, and that was *so*  much better than living in the hellhole of knowing your parents aren't interested in the real you and you're emotionally alone in the world.

Two books really helped me: Toxic Parents and, even though it's about a woman's struggle with bulimia, Brain Over Binge. I LOVE the premise - that you can kill a habit by eroding the ""stimulus -> behavior"" highway it cemented into your brain. I also loved that she had been bulimic for years, did all the therapy, all the meds, all the treatment, and finally, when everyone else's approach was ""there must be something wrong, deep down"", she found a neuroscience book and thought ""...oh, this bulimia isn't due to underlying mental illness; I just made it a compulsive habit and didn't know how to control it.""

She wants things done her way, so she has expertly manipulated you into feeling guilt for wanting things done your way. She may not know that that's what she's doing, and she may absolutely be lying to herself and may believe she just meant things for the best. But actions, consequences and reactions matter more than your intentions!

Seriously, what she's done is to metaphorically smack you in the face, then get upset because your shock/pain is making her feel like she did a bad thing. Your attitude towards what she did is making her feel bad, therefore you are making her feel bad because if your attitude had just been better, she'd have been able to do a shitty thing without feeling bad about it.

I know it feels instinctually right to feel bad about ""making her cry"", but that's the scared kid part of you that thinks it's okay if people upset you as long as they don't get angry at you. That scared kid might have been right decades ago, when they would have been totally helpless against the world if their parents got too pissed at them to help them survive (it's easier to tell yourself you were bad than to recognize that you're six and Dad hit you because he's incapable of handling his life and yours properly, for example), but you're not helpless now. You haven't known that you needed to teach your scared inner kid that the world won't fall apart if other people are mad at you.

So she's crying. You weren't cruel. Depending on how self-aware and selfish she is, you may not be able to stop her from feeling bad unless you go to her and throw yourself under the bus, say you were wrong, and offer to do the blessing she wanted. Don't.

Few things that jumped out at me: you are still pushing your feelings down because your younger self's survival instincts taught you that if Mom was okay, you'd be okay, so you had to make Mom feel okay. It's basic safety/survival, so of course it's deeply ingrained in you.

BUT. This is no longer an accurate way of looking at the world. You are not dependent on her for survival. Your guilt/fear/self-erasure/love reflex is based on *an outdated mechanism*. You do not need this mechanism any longer. What you *do*  need is to learn to value yourself, your time, your emotions, your kindness, your patience, your resources, your choices, your life. I'm going to list a bunch of things I noticed that your outdated survival habits are urging you to ignore:

1.	Your mother made it her child's responsibility to take care of her feelings and protect her from her bad choices.
2.	Your mother thinks it's fine to say things to you that you would never say to her, and if you did you would feel awful about making her feel bad.
3.	 You told her that she made you unhappy as a child, and her response was to defend herself and feel unhappy. You saw that this made her feel unhappy and you felt intense guilt and the urge to make her feel better. Why couldn't she feel like this about her own child?
4.	 By her own admission, she used her children to make up for emotional omissions in her own upbringing, and does not see anything wrong with that. She did not keep her children safe from experiencing the emotional harm she dealt with; she re-perpetrated it so she could feel the benefits of being the one inflicting the damage?
5.	 She is upset not because others are harming her, but because she is finally being forced to see that she has harmed her own children.


She does not deserve to be let off the hook for this. You should never have had to parent her as well as yourself. You did not do anything wrong here. I don't care how public the scene was. When someone punches you in the face, it's not your ""fault"" for ""making a scene"" when you say ""Ow! What the fuck is wrong with you?!"" 

You are a good and worthwhile person and what you feel and think is important. Your mother has trained you to think that her feelings are more important than yours. This is wrong. It is selfish. It is fucked-up. A human should not treat another human that way, much less their own children.

Just because her warped, self-centered worldview won't acknowledge your worth does not mean it does not exist. She will not take care of you, so you must. Put yourself first. Take care of you."

AskReddit,fclwmzh,t1_fc9ijd4,1577758263.0,"Yeah. She's a symbol, not a person. But in a person's body. With no accompanying insight into the symbol - for instance, you could try to figure out how to deal with the symbol if you knew something, anything about it, but no one ever does and no one ever tries to; they just let the evil symbol be wholly evil throughout.

Which, honestly, is kinda boring. I'd be much more interested if the men tried to figure her out and formulated a real plan to make her personally crack and be unable to continue perpetrating her crap, but she defeated them anyway. But alas."
ABraThatFits,fclw2bn,t1_fcj5yoc,1577757868.0,"If you use their own bra calculator, they'll put you in a bigger band size and tell you not to worry and trust them on it, because their bras are designed for smaller ribcages. I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically it."
ABraThatFits,fciy26t,t1_fcitbvk,1577672565.0,"Check the sidebar for store resources for small sizes. I'm a 28 C/D and have to go online for bras, but they do exist!"
ABraThatFits,fcixvlv,t1_fcim1uf,1577672440.0,"But TLBC is allergic to using accurate inches as their band sizes, so, uh, beware of that.

No idea why they're proud of mislabeling their bras and saying that that's ""just for smaller women"". Smaller women are totally capable of using accurate inch measurements; please take the hefty number of bras I've had to exchange and bite me, TLBC."

AskReddit,fcaj3at,t3_egqchb,1577570136.0,"Oh, God. I'd weigh more than I've ever weighed my whole life, I'll have to get new $500 headshots, I'd have to deal with sudden crippling depression and the inescapable knowledge of failure, I'll have to spend so much on clothes, and I'd fucking hate myself every second of every day till the weight comes off.

Also, I'd need to find therapy REAL fast to fix whatever underlying issue made me turn to food that hard.

And then I'd start panicking about cholesterol and knee stress, and have to get flats so I don't fuck up my knees in high heels... everything about this scenario is goddamn horrifying."
AskReddit,fc9h3tp,t1_fc89rz3,1577552589.0,"I'm so glad they did, because no person is 100% totally, incomprehensibly awful, and you HAVE to see that side of a villain in order to recognize the ones you meet in real life."
AskReddit,fc9gvt2,t1_fc6w6qw,1577552493.0,"Jesus. David Tennant almost sent me into a legit panic attack when I tried to explain to my boyfriend why this is literally the villain we're actually afraid of on a daily, real basis. One who rewrites your thoughts and gaslights you out of your personality. 

I do not ever have panic attacks, by the way. 28 years old without ever having one. Tennant did an AMAZING job. The whole concept and writing were spot-on."
AskReddit,fc9gdpk,t1_fc6xtwj,1577552287.0,"I did this play recently and was shocked at how much I HATED the writing. You never see her have a private moment, you never see her motivations, her thoughts, anything - she's just a straight-up bitch. One bitch, silent nurses, and whores. That's literally 100% of the female population in that play. 

There's an offstage crazy controlling, evil mother, too. Sigh. Really wish this CLASSIC PLAY'S entire approach to women wasn't ""bitches be cray."""
AskReddit,fc9fw67,t1_fc82fy7,1577552077.0,"Yeah; it's like creating emotional journeys for people means they feel you're part of them, and that they have a right to you and your time. Really weird quirk of human nature."
