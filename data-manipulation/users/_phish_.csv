starterpacks,feo7z5r,t1_fen1u20,1579296333.0,In my high schools swim locker room there was 2 urinals and one stall. The locker room was in the shape of a U and the was one on either side of the bend. One of them was right next to the showers and always had a large puddle of some question mix of liquids under it(shower water/piss/leaking urinal water) so nobody ever wanted to go stand in that to pee. For a week or so the only other urinal was not flushing. And since there was almost always someone in the stall skipping practice (swimmers you know) you usually only had the option to pee in that one urinal that didn’t flush. So it became a game to see would be the one to make it over flow. Good times. And for the record when it did over flow people didn’t stop peeing in it.

unpopularopinion,fdmg3n7,t1_fdll53e,1578548734.0,"Firstly, the opinion of wether the protestor is right or not doesn’t matter in this situation. If everyone only protests against things everyone else already hates, it’s not much of a protest, part of what makes protests happen is people think something is wrong, and the other group sets out to show that it is right. 

Secondly, a major part of the effectiveness of a protest, is having the public see the discrimination or wrong doing and get behind it. If your gym doesn’t allow men on the treadmills because they want to make sure women have access to the treadmills whenever they want, and you feel this is wrong you might protest it. However if you could only protest in the gym, it’s likely they would just take your membership away, or take a vote to show that the majority, meaning the people who benefit and the owners of the gym, like it how it is and that it shouldn’t be changed. I get it’s not a perfect scenario, but you get the gist of it. It’s a lot easier and more effective to recruit other, formerly unbiased people to join your side, than it is to change the minds of the people who already believe they are right, likely because they are benefitting.

Finally, if people don’t care about helping the cause, they don’t have too. And why should they be forced to be late? Well depending on where you are, it’s likely that there is another route to get where your going with enough time to spare. But even in the case that there isn’t you have a very obvious, valid reason as to why you’re late. Sure you could argue that there’s also fringe scenarios where and ambulance needs to get by and somebody will die because they are there. However those are fringe cases, and it’s not like ambulances are uninformed about the roads. If there’s a protest big enough to be block off a major road, it’s likely everywhere on the news, and emergency responders are fully aware of it."

However you might actually want to be careful about leaving old prescription medication around, I’m not sure if it’s illegal or not, but I know having unlabeled pill bottles is, and a whole bunch of other niche regulations, so you might want to check if it’s actually legal to have an old prescription around for no reason.

unpopularopinion,fdlfyif,t1_fdkjj3a,1578523185.0,"Well they aren’t allowed, and that’s why it works. I’m pretty sure civilians are allowed to block the road, at least in most circumstances, which means the police will likely come and stop it. This is the point of the protest.

unpopularopinion,fdinzua,t1_fdink7i,1578447164.0,"Well yes, but the idea is that there is wrong being done and unless attention is brought to it nothing will change. Yes those people legally aren’t allowed to do that, but lots of protests involve illegal activities, and the people are punished as such. However if the matter is important they will continue to cause a commotion and take the punishment until someone does something about it. It’s the cycle of a lot of the law changing peaceful protests. Gandhi did it, MLK did it, it’s how you get stuff done. I didn’t say it was legal to block traffic, but it is an effective way to get attention, and has been utilized throughout history."

unpopularopinion,fdim7zy,t1_fdil3nl,1578446030.0,That’s kind of the point though isn’t it? If nobody is inconvenienced then nobody needs to care or give it attention.
unpopularopinion,fdilxv9,t3_elh0jf,1578445848.0,"I don’t think this is unpopular, however I don’t agree personally. The point of protests, specifically peacefully ones is to cause some form of inconvenience basically. If people are standing in their front yards just holding a sign saying “don’t drink soda” it’s not really going to do much, compared to if somebody went and made it tough to get to the soda store or whatever. This could have been said about sit ins. “It doesnt matter what your protesting, I immediately don’t care if you’re sitting in my seat at the whites only counter.” If nobody went and sat there, and made people upset, and cause some actual form of unrest, nothing would have happened. Now perhaps blocking off a highway or major intersection doesn’t make sense in the specific protests you’re thinking of, but that’s a different story. That being said I’m prepared for the downvotes."

I’m sure it’s also a fetish, like a submission thing, some dudes find it hot that the woman they desire has value that can be held over them.

A good quality entry level sax will run you about 500-700$. the Jean Paul AS-400 is bang on at 500 and is very high quality. I believe many people also like Yamahas entry level student saxophones, but they are a little more pricey if I recall. But like anything else, a recommendation is only that, you should look into each saxophone separately to see if it is what you really want. Buying used is also not a bad idea, but you would have to do some research about how to buy a well maintained used saxophone, if you don’t know anything about them to begin with."
