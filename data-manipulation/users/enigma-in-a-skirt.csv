They didn’t ask to be under your care any more than human children ask to be born to their parents. I do also understand wanting another cat. I wouldn’t have described my first cat as a cat that got along with other cats either, but here’s the thing: any time she was meeting another cat, she was either at a friend’s house and scared being in new surroundings, or there was another strange cat at our house that she didn’t have the time to get comfortable around. I would look at Jackson Galaxy’s work, he does talk specifically about getting cats used to each other gradually. It’s possible to make the process comfortable for everyone, but you have to be willing to put in the work, or else you and both cats will be very stressed and very unhappy for a long time before anyone is used to each other. I don’t see any harm in doing it gently and carefully. I ended up getting a second cat (well, kitten, which is likely an important point — you should probably get a kitten, as they tend to be less threatening at first) when my first one turned 2, and while at first she was like “wtf is this alien creature you’ve thrust upon me?!”, they got along pretty quickly and even sleep curled up next to each other here and there. Any time a cat is in a new environment, it’s going to be uneasy around other animals, even other cats. They’re not like dogs where they generally immediately wanna check each other out and play. Cats are really really really SO different from dogs, I hope the two years with yours (and whatever other experience you have had with cats) has taught you that. If not I’d really suggest looking into Jackson Galaxy for more than just the new cat introduction info. He’s got a lot of really good insight to cat behaviors. I’m sure there are other really great and maybe even better sources out there, he’s just fun and makes what some might consider dry info more palatable."
