But what I will say if you do date that other woman make sure she actually feels the same way, she might be in a negative state but may not want to divorce her husband over a somebody immediately."

What some of the things you love to do? I know people say this time and time again and it may not always help but that's why I can say try to enjoy life even when it's at it's worst, I've gone through hell myself. It was sickening for me, and I even almost died at one point, but I tried making things better and it really made life more enjoyable and I hope the same can do so for you, if your hearing voices I'd recommend listening to music to get rid of it, or if that doesn't help and it goes over it reassure yourself that you know it's fake and that things just want to get you down. But with happiness and enjoying life it can't, I know when your sad your angry, I'd say apologize to your sister and talk with her, it may be hard but trust me it feels amazing when your problems go away and get out your body, and crying is okay. I hate it when people say ""Don't Cry."" crying helps you and can make you feel better. If you feel numb afterwards (Depression.) watch somethings that are funny, that's all I can help you with.

Talk with who you trust, that's all I can say you know you more than me."

People love you and you may not even know it, even if you have no friends now or no family you can talk to other people and find other people to date, you don't have to ever be alone in these things, and even then you now have one more person who cares about you in your life, everybody who see's this. Why do you think this? I just need more reason, life is worth living and I know that myself since I've gotten through it twice, I cried for a man I never personally knew after he had been sent to prison wrongfully in the 1980's and only came out in 2008, people care for you. Don't do it."
offmychest,ff26zk0,t3_er42g1,1579495596.0,"I have P.T.S.D and I've seen people over-exaggerate that they have it; I had a friend in Secondary-school that said he had it too and lied to many people he did, he said he got it after being abused by his dad, the problem is was he did what I did with my P.T.S.D sometimes when people would hand me sharp objects I'd block my face like I was about to get stabbed and I was sensitive and scared of loud booming noises. P.T.S.D Comes in multiple forms, I started becoming suspicious but then thought over it, maybe his Dad hurt him badly, maybe if I could trust him with my problems with it he could trust me with his problems.

He said his dad just insulted him and ruined him emotionally.

I asked how he was going through the same fears I was.

He shrugged at me and said that's what P.T.S.D is.

Okay, so you can say he's not lying or is, but I've been stabbed in the gut once so this feeling did tap me on the shoulder that he was lying, I had been explained by my Doctor/Therapist that this kind of P.T.S.D had to due with your past and it can vary with person to person and mine was very bad since I had seen literal fires and have been stabbed before. He acted deadly scared of these things like I did. I knew right there he was lying.

I just asked to go to the Bathroom and went into the hall and ate the rest of the small almonds at the bottom of my pocket in a plastic bag.

The things people lie about scare me, be proud you don't suffer with these don't use it to get more attention or whatever you want it for."

Have a good evening."
offmychest,ff25330,t1_ff24sqg,1579494039.0,"Thank you, It's unique I guess, it's a hell of time for myself indeed but it feels nice to share it with others, It really makes me think of how lucky I am, or horrible my life is, but either way I appericate being born in this time.

Have a good evening."
