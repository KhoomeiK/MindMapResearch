exjw,ffd60ey,t1_ffb0tie,1579814096.0,Can confirm. I used to be that friend. But mainly bc my dad was an elder and I was terrified of getting the shit beat out of me for disobeying if he found out and then of course being destroyed by Jehovah. Not excusing it but I also understand how manipulation and abuse makes us all both victims and abusers
exjw,fezrf89,t1_fevcxos,1579460695.0,As a lover of scotch and giving blow jobs im trying to imagine the equivalent....
exjw,fesz4px,t1_feqtwf9,1579370361.0,"Bruh it’s sad i recognize so many of these personality types you described. It’s like the “pillars” of the Kingdom Hall are creepy old man, severely mental ill woman, obsessive single sister etc. I saw so many of them in so many congregations lol"
fatlogic,fefytsb,t1_fef6hkx,1579069870.0,Yeah they need to stop aligning with the trans community. Stop pretending eating less cake is the same level of oppression as being denied human rights and murdered for existing
exjw,fecqmuk,t3_eocw0q,1578981031.0,"I graduated nursing school. Work at a leading pediatric hospital. Applying for grad school to become an NP this year. Met an amazing partner. We now live together with our adorable fur baby. Reconnected with family that left or were never in the cult. Have a support system of chosen family that understand me and support me. I get to spend my free time learning bass, hiking, and cooking new recipes with my partner. Most of all found my identity and have been learning to love myself when I was conditioned not to. It gets better!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fdsqmng,t1_fdq0vxd,1578706682.0,"Not worth arguing. They can’t see past the blinders of the religion. Im thankful that the pediatric hospital Im at gets court orders to protect children from people like this. 

I was a devout jw and at 17 thought I didn’t want to take blood when I almost needed it. 

4 years later I left that religion and I’m thankful it wasn’t something more serious. All we can do is create policies to protect kids from these people."
exjw,fdsnvf7,t1_fdqme3c,1578705659.0,I commented about automatic disfellowshipping for willingly taking a transfusion and they replied that it was “doubtful.” As a pediatric nurse this shit is so goddamn infuriating
