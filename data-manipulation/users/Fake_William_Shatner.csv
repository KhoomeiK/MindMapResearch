Yeah, someone else want to engage this person in debate? I feel like I need an interpreter or a ten foot pole.

Not that it matters. This is just a dispute over opinions that don't mean a hill of beans. I see people far less intelligent than me be far more successful, so I don't see as much value because I take it for granted. For another person, it's probably more important because everything is rocket science. 

Bernie is smart, but not a super genius. Noam Chompsky is super genius, but might not be able to get things done in congress. Hillary is book smart and awkward, Bill is smooth as silk. AOC is very smart, but not as well educated as Hillary,.. but she makes better conclusions with the information she has.

There are so many kinds of intelligence, it's pointless to try and cover them all.

But bottom line; if you don't have integrity and heart -- NOTHING else matters. I don't want intelligent and evil Henry Kissinger flying nukes around the planet.

""Incapacity."" Which, you know, should be a reason for someone not to be in office and certainly does seem pertinent to someone like Trump,... but, in terms of the impeachment, not applicable.

""Crimes and misdemeanors are synonymous terms.""
So misdemeanors means nothing? ""Crimes are of a deeper nature, while smaller faults and omissions are..."" And he goes right back to pointing out that a misdemeanor is a less serious crime -- but hey, the dancing around sure did make it seem like he said something important. Then he talks about that there are ""capital misdemeanors"" so, yeah, the US law gets things wrong -- what does that have to do with the situation? I think we can argue they aren't talking about j-walking, but acts that jeopardize our sovereignty, security, integrity and abuse power such as graft, emoluments, extortion, bribery, election fraud, etc.

He passes over; ""ordering subordinates to break the law...""
Trump ordered his people to ignore subpoenas which is to break the law. So, he's guilty full stop. Dershowitz's bedazzling history summary interspersed with useful bits of nonsense to support his client addresses that. Dersh goes over all kinds of side trips on history, and how things can be confusing and interpreted different ways -- but he does not address the ""spirit of the law."" Ignores the bright red warning signs and dives into the minutia whenever something is confused -- and jumps to people who are NOT the constitution to do it.

If abuse of power were NOT an issue, then what is? And bribery is explicitly mentioned. ""But, he wasn't giving them military support, he was preventing them from getting it."" If such meanderings were acknowledged there would be NOBODY in jail right now. ""I didn't steal the big screen TV, I merely prevented them from having it.""

""Self serving motive""
https://youtu.be/uqmhfyH09jM?t=2693
He's trying to say that helping your own interests out instead of the country is pretty subjective. Well, this is law; it's ALL subjective. We have to know what was ""in the President's mind at the time"". Well, manslaughter and murder are separated by intent. As a criminal lawyer, somehow Dersh forgot that HUGE bit of the law. If Trump did NOTHING about corruption but pursue dirt on Biden -- in what Universe is that not intended to get dirt on a political rival? We have evidence that he never asked about other issues in Ukraine. And, we see instance after instance of Trump self-serving. While I'm sure Trump might conclude his re-election is in the national interest -- this is introducing the slippery slope that self delusion would allow someone to commit any offense. ""I thought he was going to kill me -- so, shooting the bank guard was in self defense."" By extension, the logic he's trying to push here, is starting a war is okay if you think it helps your image as a leader, because the country really needs you as a leader. But was the war good for the country? No. Was stopping Ukraine from defending itself from our rival, Russia in the national interest? No. So, without any proof that Trump is somehow better for the nation -- his motivation to ""serve the national interest"" is not as important as the objective national interest.

If intent were that important, then there would not be impeachment at all. Courts all the time convict people based on assumed intent, but, if they are self deluded -- they are usually convicted of murder anyway. The ""insanity defense"" rarely ever works, and it usually just changes the venue of incarceration. If Trump is too deluded to know his interest from the nations -- then he can go to Bellvue.

What Dersh fails to argue here is; were the framers interested in the national interest when they added the ability to impeach, or in the rights of the President? Well, I don't know the exact answer because I'm not a constitutional scholar, but I suspect it would be the former.

The framers didn't want it to be trivial, but, it's clear using the power of the office for personal gain is off limits and clearly that is what Trump did.
What's also clear is that perjury is not impeachable. It is a misdemeanor which does not affect the interests of the USA. Dersh raised the bar for that, and lowered it for treason, and shaking down an ally to guarantee a win in an election.


Dersh is really good at being impressive without educating you at all. The only conclusion is that nobody can be impeached, unless it's lying about a blow job. He did a good job impressing people without critical thinking skills. Of course, impeachment is about convincing the public whether or not to re-elect their senator, so by that measure -- sure, successful. But, he's not laying the groundwork for anything except; ""nobody can be impeached."" If you make that legal argument -- then why is there impeachment? You can't have a law you can't prove (even if some are really difficult to enforce).

Note, that the Republicans have abandoned the argument of guilt or innocence with Trump. They are arguing that nobody can be impeached. Even if they win that one -- they are going to lose the principle goal of these trials; getting Republicans re-elected if they support Trump."

He's so insecure he's got to constantly reinforce himself with an echo chamber that says nice things -- so; that means Fox News and Breitbart are where he goes to learn. 

For instance; what value is intelligence if you are about to meet a foreign dignitary and you don't run what you are about to say by someone who has a masters degree on the country, and maybe someone who knows current politics, and maybe someone who does protocol? The POTUS is a team -- ideally.

So, you don't really have to be that smart to look smart. Ronald Reagan had a nice voice of authority. Didn't embarrass himself. Nobody knew when he became senile exactly, but for a while, he was dumb as rocks. Most of the decisions were made by Nancy Reagan and George Bush (senior) who is smart, and does seek good advice, Nancy read horoscopes  but had people intelligence (knew when someone was BS or undermining her).

Hillary Clinton -- super high IQ and a superior memory. Don't let her talk to crowds -- call Bill Clinton, who has amazing social skills -- he knows what people want to hear.

So, maybe Trump could do a good job reading a business structure brief, or an investment report -- but, damn, he is so dense in other areas. He's Dunning-Kruger syndrome writ large. His picture should be on warning labels for not ventilating while using glue.

Now, let's compare this to Bernie Sanders. He has great emotional intelligence - avoids getting sucked into the weeds and baited. Is humble, and seeks out the best advice. Is not stuck on agendas but focuses on goals. Knows how to be forceful but not insulting. Doesn't need to have the best memory like Hillary because he always acts with integrity so doesn't have to remember where the land mines are buried.

The solutions aren't actually more complicated than the layer of lies that have been required to make us not do the right thing. So, integrity is probably the most important quality of a leader. But the next most important thing we need in a ""smart"" leader, is that they just identify who has the best solutions and thinking and tap them for help.

Very hard not to have SOME bias, because as you said-- just the raw numbers doesn't always mean as much. You need to know if he's 80% in a state a Dem can win or not.

But, things would be easier if we just went for one person one vote and ignored which state or county it occurred in. The whole ""strategy"" of where to campaign and how many people to please and where has turned this into a game. A candidate is no longer focused on ""what's best for most Americans"" they are focused on ""well, in New York this won't piss them off a lot but it gets me over the 55% mark in Ohio."" So the pitch is micromanaged into meaninglessness.

Of Trump is impeached, the Republicans will start to unravel.

If the DNC and RNC fail to prevent the USA from electing Bernie Sandars, the Democrats will rush in and try and rescue the status quo and seek leniency on Republicans, but the damage and repair to their brand might take years.

If Bernie wins against the wishes of the parties and the media -- then the DNC is in for a shakeup as well. Throw out what you know. As soon as the public realizes that intractable problems they thought we'd have to deal with forever are actually solvable without much pain or time -- the paradigm shift to another New Deal will have begun."

Trademark is about representation of your brand, and to prevent confusing your product or logo with that of another. 

You automatically have some copyright and trademark just for producing and publishing your work -- but registering it helps you later in a lawsuit.

You have to protect a trademark and actively go after those who would use it or abuse it.
