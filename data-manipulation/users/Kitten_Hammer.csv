Whataburgers during this era seemed kind of stale menu wise, the biggest promotion I recall was pushing *""just say Bacon and Cheese, please""* to add to any menu item. 

They dropped the blue and started offering LTO's like the A-1 Thick & Hearty and the BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich and the rest is history."

The living assistant begins screaming bloody murder so I shot a fire arrow into his open mouth, setting the cross and his dead buddy ablaze. 

At that point the leader tried to make a run for it, so I wounded him with a pistol, hogtied him, and tossed him into the burning cross.
