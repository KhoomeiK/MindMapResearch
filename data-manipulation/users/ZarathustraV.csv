WhiteWolfRPG,fenkeu4,t1_fenee29,1579286582.0,"Ahh, I see. From our POV yes, from their POV not so much.

Also, Nephandi have shorter life spans (on avg) than a Kindred does. So now they get to be evil for a longer period of time. Bit of a toss up.

Also, marauders ain’t always evil, just confused. So sure, stripping Nephandi of their powers is a good thing. Giving them Cainite powers.....not such a good thing."

And did you read my post? Dominate doesn’t show up, so no, not all forms of vampire contact show up.

So, you've got yourself a kine a bit too addicted to the Vitae, huh? This is why creating your own pet human can be a bit double edged.

Yes, you have many options for how to rid yourself of them, and your options on how to do so humanely are rather limited. You could:

A) Murder him yourself; this would not be humane, but, it's the lowest risk to the Masquerade as you could dispose of the body properly (fire turns all things to ash eventually; cement boots work too, in deep waters)

B) Send him to his death; this isn't particularly humane, there's only a small difference between killing someone yourself and pushing them into a hungry bear exhibit at the zoo and letting the bear do the actual killing.

This does, however, have the possibility of slightly redeeming the misdeeds of his past life. You could send him on a suicidal mission, but one that, if accomplished, would bring good to the world (rinse and repeat if he keeps surviving these supposed suicidal missions). At least then he died trying to do something good. Even if massively foolish. (and only because you made him go do that)

C) You could try to trade/give the ghoul to another Kindred; but nobody wants a Renfield; you'd just as likely be giving that other kindred a pain-in-their-ass, which they'd remember was *your* doing, and you probably don't want a kindred angry at you, you who were trying to make like.

D) The only way I could see one being able to let a ghoul go, and not murder it, would be to make it so demented that society would lock it up and ignore it's possible claims of knowing vampires are real. (This is also not particularly humane, since you must really fuck with their mind) Otherwise, if the ghoul is released back into the world, it's risk to the Masquerade is too high.

Remember this, next time you decide to drag a non-Kindred into our world. There's no going back for them; they're in this forever--or until *you* get bored with them. And then, well, as I said, you have options."

Depends how he was murdered. Gunshot to the head? I don’t know why they’d do a thorough check of his blood type....but maybe?

Somewhere in V5 I think it says that Kindred don’t use ghouls at the CDC (a place they would obviously want to infiltrate and keep tabs on) because with close enough inspection Vitae and human blood can be distinguished.

Instead they use Dominate and such—that’s not detectable with blood testing."
