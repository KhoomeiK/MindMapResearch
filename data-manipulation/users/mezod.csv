I agree with you this has had an adverse effect. I shouldn't have answered at all. Independently of how condescending I might've been (again I apologize, I'm human), I was the only side actually trying to bring arguments to the table. I don't think I've been disrespectful in a single answer.

I appreciate you taking the time to write me this, really. After a few of this response I have made the mental exercise of reasoning about my behaviour several times. I don't feel personally attacked, I simply don't know what would have been a better answer other than ""yes you are right!

productivity,fcz9p6l,t1_fcx4zem,1578096506.0,"Sure, I'm happy to be transparent about my work! And I agree with you that this is a significant barrier that makes any potential customers/users to stop using it early on.

Having said this, the reason is not technical. As you say, changing the value from 3 to 5 would cost me relatively nothing (need to update the texts in a few places etc). Also, there is an incremental cost to storage, support (people who dont pay still email me to ask for my help, and I'm happy to help, but that's also time I need to spend answering! for example I took the time to answer everyone in this thread and I still got flamed to hell because people didn't value having the fact that I cared enough to respond, plus other costs.) However, again this is not the reason for me not to raise the limit. The actual reason is monetary. If I raise it to 5, people who now pay to create 4 or 5 habits wouldn't be paying. If they weren't paying I wouldn't be making enough to pay my bills. I'd need to find a job, I'd stop working on the app. Noone would be able to use the app. This is why I've been doing it the other way around. I worked freelance and worked on this sideproject late at night after my day job every day to develop it and make it grow. After 2 years like this, I finally managed to make enough to pay my bills (and by this I mean, just pay my bills, I haven't done any holidays for 3 years for example). At that point I decided to work full time on it, so that I can work more on it and grow it faster. 

Does any of this make any sense? :)"
productivity,fcz8kv5,t1_fcwqnrs,1578095856.0,"Awesome! That's also why I partly cap it at 3 habits. Otherwise many people try to do too much too early and it's counterproductive.

Regarding your suggestion, I'll add it to the list of things to consider. However, my first thought is that we need to identify individual habits. I.e preplanning when a reminder should prompt you to drink isn't such a good strategy as it is to try to form the habit to drink every day after X thing happens. For example, ""wake up"" ""drink glass of water"" ""shower"" ""brush teeth"" ""drink glass of water"" .... arrive home after work --> ""drink glass of water"". Etc, if you define when you should be drinking a glass of water, you'll end up doing, without reminders. Not sure I conveyed the point I tried to make! But I'll still consider it since it adds flexibility!"
productivity,fcwez9j,t1_fcwduyr,1578023919.0,"Agreed, lesson learnt. I was just in uncontrolled defensive mode. Still, I consider the fact that I took the time to answer as caring for what they got to say. Will try to improve in that regard!"

productivity,fcwbwdf,t1_fcw8s59,1578021827.0,"haha sorry if my punchy title offended you, of course I am. It was just to get people's attention and generate a discussion :)"
productivity,fcwbfar,t1_fcw8rij,1578021518.0,"First of all, I appreciate that you are the very first person who despite disagreeing with my arguments has stopped to think about them thoroughly. After all, I have been thinking through this problem for months, while some people just spent 30 seconds. Sorry, if I sounded condescending, I think it was the best way in which I could answer (at that moment) considering some comments triggered ""defensive mode"". In the same situation, 99% of the people would have ignored the messages. So me answering was actually caring about the issue and trying to give reasons, not the ""I'm not goinng to change anything / listen to you"" you wrote about.

But getting back to the point in question. I agree with you, really, honestly. The problem is that the same people who complain about there not being enough free habits are the same that then demand more things and are unhappy when I don't develop what they demand. This is not the first app I develop and I have already seen enough projects die because of trying to give everything for free and have everyone happy. I do this more for fun and to help others than to make a living, but I still need to make a living. I will raise it to 5 when I can afford doing so!

You suggest I add ads which is a respectable option. In my opinion ads are way fishier than a limitation. First, they clutter the whole experience. Second, asking to pay to remove ads would mean that the value of my premium account is not to form habits but to get rid of me nagging you with ads. If you valued the app for what it could help you accomplish, you wouldn't suggest that! Which takes us to the real deal here. Everyone who complains about such limitation and having a premium plan is gonna complain independently of the number of free habits.

Despite this, I repeat that you are right about 5 being better than 3. My goal is unlimited free habits. Some apps do offer it from the beginning but they sell users' data instead. I understand that many users don't care about their privacy, but I do, and I don't want to be part of this game if I can avoid it.

To finish, and in my defense, people who flame others' work for not being free enough should rethink twice their approach. Being disappointed is understandable, but a polite complaint might open more doors.

I hope I can raise the limit to 5 very soon, thanks again for taking the time to write your comment, sincerely, even if you'd just punch me in the face right now!"

productivity,fcu33k9,t3_eiy22l,1577971092.0,"Hi! First of all I wanted to be transparent about the fact that https://everyday.app is an application [I've been working on for 3 years](https://app.everyday.app/2/1) and that it's my full-time job.

This are my 3 best habits of the year! I started very very strong with reading but somehow messed up at the end of the summer (I think the beach had a lot to do with that hehe). 

If you have to keep something from this post, is that it's much better to do a little bit EVERY DAY, than a lot every once in a while. Consistency is the key.

One of my new favourite quotes is ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" by J. Clear. I'm sure you've already heard about it but before you commit to New Resolutions in the wrong way... make sure to focus on the system:

**Start with your identity:** Who do you want to become? What really motivates you to wake up every morning?

**Outline this thoughts into goals.** Make sure they align with the conclusions you got in 1.

**Break each goal into a list of achievable daily actions.**

**Make them so ridiculously small** it's easier for you to do them than to bear with the thought of not having done them. I.e ""do 1 push-up"", ""write 300 words"", ""read 1 page"".

**Do it every day.**

**For a very long time.** Chain as many days in a row and do not increment until it's become easy enough. Consistency beats sporadic outbursts of motivation.

Discipline and consistency make the difference. For example, I set the goal to read 40 books in 2019 by reading a little bit every day. In the end, I'll struggle to finish the 28th. At first, it feels like disappointment for a failed challenge, but then I realize that the true challenge was to read every day, and at that, I've done amazingly good!

While I only read 10 books in 2018, I read 28 in 2019! That's almost 3 times more! What changed? I successfully formed the habit to read every day.

Now that I know what reading 28 books feels like, I know I can reach 40 in 2020.

Hope this helps some of you make the best of this new decade :) Happy new year!"

52book,fcs2how,t1_fcs17ly,1577910475.0,It's called https://everyday.app :)
GetMotivated,fcs07bj,t1_fcrybku,1577909318.0,Awesome! I hope it helps! :)
GetMotivated,fcrzs0b,t1_fcryy5u,1577909111.0,"That's pretty nice, I mean, unless you spend a lot of time doing reviews ofc!"
52book,fcrznbj,t1_fcrzfan,1577909039.0,It also motivates you to keep your streak alive by reading a little bit even when you dont feel like it! So it helps you form the habit to :)
dataisbeautiful,fcru4aq,t1_fcrss7x,1577906639.0,Yeah it does help a ton! Because every day you just visualize all your progress at once and immediately know if you are doing good or not. It's sort of like if you can look into the person you are becoming! I also really like this visualization: https://app.everyday.app/2/2
GetMotivated,fcrtuex,t1_fcrt2ow,1577906539.0,"Ah, that's cool! I didn't know Google did that! Is it decent money?"
GetMotivated,fcrr243,t1_fcrqplx,1577905464.0,haha we're all sharing the struggle!! I managed a 82% completion on coding this year though! can't complain!
GetMotivated,fcrqwnz,t1_fcrptf4,1577905409.0,"That's sort of my goal. To get to a point where I can afford giving most of the current app for free, while just charging for advanced features. This is already what I do now to make a living, but the more I manage to grow it the more free stuff I'll be able to afford :) It's a tough start but putting the daily effort every day for 3 years is getting me there!! This is my streak for working on the app https://app.everyday.app/2/1 :)"
GetMotivated,fcrp58y,t1_fcroegi,1577904741.0,Sure! It's https://everyday.app (Disclaimer: I'm the developer) It helps you form new habits by building strong streaks! It's important because you need to focus on the daily goal instead of the overall goal. I.e instead of committing to read 40 books a year (which doesn't help you in any way) it's better to commit to read X pages every day. If you manage to do that you end up reading way beyond that amount. This example is applicable to any sort of goal really!
dataisbeautiful,fcrdzpv,t3_eikzxx,1577900550.0,"Hello people from dataisbeautiful!

This is becoming sort of a tradition for me now, but every year I come to share the progress on my habit streaks. Quite some progress if you compare it to the 2017 edition! https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7nfzqa/i_tracked_my_habit_streaks_of_2017_oc/

These are my habits that I tracked using https://everyday.app which is my sideproject now turned into full time business. If you check the last habit of the list that'll explain a lot about how I finally managed to live off my own little app :) Aaaaand of course it had to have beautiful data in it! For the curious, the app has other data visualizations (https://app.everyday.app/2/1) and I'm always looking for new inspiration in this sub :P

Happy new 2020!"
getdisciplined,fcqjf0k,t1_fcp6hzi,1577887058.0,"Hehe thank you! very fair concerns. The short answer is yes, I'm fully committed to this app for a long time. I've been working on it for 3 years now and I hope to keep doing so for many more. I developed this app for myself so I'm the very first person interested in the app getting better. I actually just wrote a little post on this that might remove some of your worries: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/everyday-app-year-3-approaching-5k-mrr-cb5916f0fe

To summarize it for you, the whole point of the app (and the post) is about the fact that committing to our goals should be a long term game. We need to do a little bit every day, for a very long time. I am just trying to preach with example here, otherwise, what's the point?

1. Definitely need to add more colours, it's on the top of my list!
2. Oh, that looks like a browser/system issue, which browser are you using? They definitely look ugly!

Awesome! Hope it will help you! ""Long term"" and ""Barcelona fan"" in the same sentence, immediate love ;D We're sucking this season!"
getdisciplined,fcqiag7,t1_fco0r7t,1577886473.0,"As far as humans goes, we all need skips at some point or another ;)"
getdisciplined,fcqi7fp,t1_fcnvses,1577886431.0,"Nothing to apologize about! I do offer a lifetime license you can find at https://everyday.app/pricing (just sharing in case you missed it). I've explained some of the reasons on the pricing in another answer in case you want to understand the reasoning behind the subscription a bit better (so that I don't come out as a greedy bastard). In any case, if the current free version isn't enough for you, don't let this derail you from tracking your habits, even if it's on paper!"
getdisciplined,fcqh99m,t1_fcnvc2j,1577885959.0,"Yeah, sorry, it's easy to overlook if you are not using the web version. You can find the details here https://everyday.app/pricing . It's only web because of point of sales policies (google/apple taking 30% cuts). Plus if I put that offer on mobile, people would kill me with bad reviews (been there...).

The idea of a lifetime license per version is interesting. It's like a hybrid. I am not sure how ""handleable"" would that be with web apps and mobile apps, like it's not a specific piece of product that's closed and distributed, but I'm sure it can be pulled off. I'll check those examples, thank you!

Taking this little concept to B2B is always on the horizont, but right now it's fairly unrealistic. It'd actually make sense to reuse most of the code for a separate product with different copy, etc. I do believe there's a strong opportunity for this sort of apps in team management but not in the traditional way. I don't want this app to land in businesses for managers to micromanage and ruin people's lives. It's not the way to go imho. I do see much more future in company culture building. Yes, I know it might sound marketingy, but it's not the same thing with a different cover, it's a different way of understanding a tool that does the very same. I'm not sure I managed to convey my point here?

Ofc there's a lot more money in there but money isn't really my goal here (beyond earning enough for me not to have to worry too much about the prices of food in the supermarket). I really want to build a tool to empower people and I think universalizing habit tracker is a good way to start!"
getdisciplined,fcpot64,t1_fcnt6eg,1577868912.0,"hehe gotcha I'll try to keep that in mind even though I'm not a big fan of notifications, it's so easy to disregard them. Even when they are incredibly intrusive they even become associated to a negative feeling which might impede action... dunno, but I know it works for a lot of people so I'll definitely bring em up into a future desktop app!"
getdisciplined,fcnswrh,t1_fcn7osk,1577817792.0,"This sort of comments break my heart, so I really appreciate them. My goal really is to make this accessible to everyone. I'm working hard to make this possible, really. I'm sorry if my post might have deceived you, but the real purpose was to give my 5 cents on how I approach systems instead of goals.

Again, and to avoid confusion, the app has several subscription/license offers on the website in case you've overseen them."
getdisciplined,fcns8dv,t1_fcn5zth,1577817431.0,"I really appreciate you taking the time to write this. Believe it or not this is something that every app developer has to think about several times.

I thought exactly like you, until data proved me wrong. I have done several other applications before that I couldn't live of, precisely because I needed huge amounts of traffic and $20 or $10 sales to survive. As a developer, I don't need to say how bad I am at marketing, so yeah, that might play a big role too. But in an ever higher competitive world it's quite difficult if you ask me. I did some apps that were even more technically difficult and when I quote $20 lifetime to people who had been using it for free they'd just write me pissed emails telling me how dare I try to charge them. Sad truth is that we live in a culture where people hardly value other people's work for what it's worth. 

I honestly would love to make the app way more accessible to everyone, especially to those who can't afford it because those are the  ones who might need it the most. That's why my goal is to remove as many of the basic limitations as possible as soon as I can economically do so. And for that moment to arrive, I'm afraid subscriptions are really the shortcut.

In any case, this is the big debate from mobile developers. Many do an app, put it out there and try to reap benefits for months or years. I am not a mobile developer, this is my full time business, I don't have other apps, I work on this all day, every day. I make it a little bit better every day. If you pay $10 today, you aren't paying for my improvements of tomorrow.

I'd keep sharing my thoughts but trust me I'm just a little drop of water being moved around by the sea. I have my own ideas and ethics but I cannot change people's culture. For now I can only help them change their behaviours hehe :P

Btw, I do sell a limited amount of lifetime licenses, but I don't want to spam here."
getdisciplined,fcnqo7t,t1_fcnewgf,1577816614.0,"Hehe :P Just so you know you can put the web app and turn it into a Desktop app with tools like Coherence and Setapp. Many of my users already do that. I do want to write an article on how to do it, as well as a future native desktop app...

Have you tried using the broswer extensions to put the app on your newtab background so every time you open a new tab you see your board?

I agree with you, I'm quite against reminders, in the end we just need to form the habit to track our habits. I personally just check my board once every night before I go to sleep."
getdisciplined,fcnqckn,t1_fcncf1u,1577816439.0,"That's not exactly how I approach it.

Having a number of books in mind, i.e ""read 10 books this year"" is a goal. Goals are motivating but motivation fades. It's easy to dream about yourself having read 10 books, but it's hard to get there and numeric goals don't help you in any specific way. That's why we need systems. Systems do help you because they involve action. So my focus is put on reading every day, no matter how little. Some days I read 3 pages, some days I read 50. This keeps adding up, 3+50+7+20+12+31+24+6.... and before you know it, you've reached your goal.

My point is, don't focus too much on your ""10 books a year"" but focus instead on ""read at least 1 page a day"" and when you've done that for a month, then move onto ""read at least 2 pages a day"". If you do that, you'll be soon reading 28 books a year! (That's where it got me this far at least haha!)"
getdisciplined,fcnpnsw,t1_fcn6o4n,1577816071.0,"I'd start by picking maximum 3 of the following: (obviously adapt it to your level/skills)
1. play pentatonic scale 5 times
2. read 1 music concept a day
3. read 1 page a day
4. Write 500 words a day
5. Stretch 2 minutes
6. Meditate 2 minutes
