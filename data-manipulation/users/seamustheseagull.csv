On a given week you could literally have zero hours, but you're still bound by the terms of your contract. 

There's a massive movement to outlaw then because they are financially crippling for the people who sign up to them, but many companies have introduced them as the default part-time contract, so the employee has no choice."

For example, if you find a role that says it involves travelling to customer sites, then you know the job involves some level of sales, even if you're a consultant. 

If you spent 3 months doing cold calling a decade ago, then you will know that you hate sales and you'll know this job isn't for you.

That's generally not really a possibility in acting. People who don't gel with their co-stars, don't work. ""Turn up, do your job and go home"", generally means that your performances will be wooden at best.

It seems like a lot of abusive relationships progress to murder or serious injury, which wouldn't make sense if the abuser was fully in control of themselves. 

But I suppose there are the ones who *are* out of control, and they end up murdering their partners. They're the loud minority, not the silent majority. 
Even if they're a small proportion of abusers, and most are in fact maliciously calculating, the few who do lose control provide a convenient cover of mental illness for the rest."

It's evidence that companies are generating bigger profits. And not necessarily all companies. If enough huge companies are generating big profits, the stock market will soar, even though SMEs may be on the ropes.

Inflation-adjusted, wages in the US have decreased over the last decade, despite the stock markets massively increasing.

Think Apple won't abuse this to make their assets (and companies who'll take their money) work slicker in iOS? Or Google and Android?

This is a good idea in principle, but it should be used as a way for the server to ask what features are supported, and provide supported content on that basis. Browser type, version and OS should be irrelevant to the server. It asks the browser, ""do you support embedded video?"". ""Yes"". Hurrah!

No more than a man should be morally obliged to disclose he has a micropenis, or a woman morally obliged to disclose her double mastectomy. 

I would like to note at this point that this discussion is often a jumping point for strawmen. Transpeople don't ""surprise"" cis people with their status. The transperson is by far the more vulnerable party in any such exchange. The cis person might feel ""duped"". Oh noes. The transperson risks being beaten to death by some angry psychopath. 
Transpeople are virtually never coy about their status with a potential partner and will actively seek out situations where they know potential partners are trans-friendly. 

It is for this reason that transpeople generally advise themselves to be upfront as early as possible and trust their gut. Walk away without telling them anything if you think the ""suitor"" might react badly. 

Morally obligated? No. Obligated by self-preservation? Sadly necessary. 

*If they are trans but have not chosen to physically transition, then not being upfront is a dick move, no pun intended. There would be a clear expectation to find ""something"" down there, and leaving it as a surprise is not cool."

But not quite as low as you think it is. It doesn't have to be an open flame left burning or a faulty appliance. Simple error is a big one. Most people have a source of extreme heat in their homes; the cooker. You can tell the child they're never to turn it on, but they could turn it on by accident. Or they may decide to use the microwave instead and stick some metal in because they aren't aware that it is metal.

Or they may decide to carry out an ""experiment"", turn on an incandescent bulb, wrap it in tissue paper and leave it for half an hour.
