Maybe it's a translation error, but the quote presented as-is seems axiomatic and trite."
boston,fffphni,t1_fffmka2,1579888974.0,"Yeah but the people have voted and they think you're wrong too. Also, you've been inundated with information from me and OP about the history of the war on drugs and how it still affects people of color today, and you haven't even bothered to acknowledge it, let alone refute it. You've made no attempt to explain why our current policies shouldn't attempt to rectify the institutional racism of the past, nor have you offered even a scintilla of evidence that you've been exposed to any of MLK's work other than the ""I Have a Dream"" speech or referenced any of his other works to support your color-blind interpretation thereof.


So, to be clear, I suspect I'm correct because I have data and fundamentals of logical reasoning to back me up, plus I won the popular vote to boot. What makes you think you're correct other than your own delusion and entitlement? You clearly come from a background where admitting that you're wrong is seen as a sign of weakness, and I assure you it's not. You know what takes real strength? Admitting that you've made a mistake and learning from the experience."
boston,fffhixc,t1_fff734h,1579884087.0,"Not at all. If we have any interest in rectifying the racism of the past, rather than just sheepishly promising to try our best not to repeat it, then the programs we create to achieve those ends must necessarily acknowledge not only race, but how different races have been--and continue to be--disparately affected by our laws and their implementation.

Otherwise, what's the point? You see it as injustice that the social equity program makes it a little easier for people of color to legally participate in the marijuana industry. (Oh no, the horror!) 

People of color see it as an injustice that they are arrested and incarcerated at a way higher rate than white people are for drug crimes despite the fact that usage rates are nearly identical across races. Not that it was ever a surprise, given that Nixon proposed the War on Drugs as an excuse to lionize and disrupt the black community (supposedly because they weren't supportive enough of the Vietnam War--the bastards!). 

People of color see it as an injustice that they are still--in 2020!--redlined out of loans that similarly situated white people qualify for, which makes it way harder for them to access the capital necessary to get any business up and running, especially in an industry without consistent access to banking services due to federal politics, nevermind the application and permit fees and massive amount of capital that the state requires marijuana license applicants to prove they have (allegedly for liability reasons or some shit like that, but that rule conveniently wipes every applicant without access to capital off the map.)

People of color see it as an injustice that, even after the enactment of a bill that was hailed as legalizing marijuana for everyone and rectifying the consequences of the war on drugs, they are still being arrest for marijuana crimes at higher rates than white people and still being blown off by regulators who always seem to have the time for applicants with deep pockets, who are almost always white.


All of this, of course, ignores the other forms of systematic and institutional racism that communities of color have been dealing with in this country--and make no mistake, in this state too--for centuries.


It's not the 70s anymore. The conversation has evolved way beyond the rigid mindset that not-racist = color-blind, just like how the conversation about feminism has evolved beyond burning bras.

You probably aren't that familiar with Dr. King's work if you think that ""I have a dream that one day my children will be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character"" = MLK advocating for race-blind government programs, let alone in any sort of absolutist sense with no regard for place, time, or context. I hope you use this as an opportunity to expose yourself to more of his work so you don't embarrass yourself so badly and publicly in the future."

boston,fff5n58,t1_fff3ggy,1579876324.0,"Yes. If a system that claims to work for all works only for a select few in practice, then the system isn't actually working. Especially in light of the legal implications of this systematic dysfunction, now is a particularly timely opportunity to heed MLK's warning that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
nfl,ffe55ig,t1_ffdxbhl,1579836966.0,"I don't think that's true. I had a great uncle (who was Jewish) who got tattoos during his time in the Navy but had them removed before he died specifically so he could be buried in a Jewish cemetery... He's no longer alive so I can't confirm, but I can only imagine that he went to those lengths because he was explicitly instructed accordingly."

Very, very wholesome..."
