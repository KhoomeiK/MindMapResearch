AskReddit,fgnolec,t3_ezauxv,1580949460.0,"Keep your guard (hands) up and tuck your chin. Getting hit square in the jaw is like an off switch. If you throw a punch, you need to make sure you don’t leave yourself open. Wildly swinging your firsts may be an instinct, but it’s a good way to get laid out.

Don’t swing wildly trying to get “more power”. You’ll leave yourself open and it’ll be extremely obvious to block. 

When you punch, make sure your thumb is *not* tucked into your fist. 

If you find yourself on your knees while the other person is still upright, try to bring them to the ground with you. If you can get their back and put them in a headlock, they probably won’t be able to get out of it. 

Don’t keep your feet right next to each other, and don’t walk in a way where your legs will cross over each other. Think about how you’d stand if someone was trying to push you over and you wanted to stay upright. 

Finally, if you can avoid a fight, do so. You always win the fight you don’t have."

I’m certain there are people who are genuinely upset about what happened, but at the end of the day, it’s still WC3 with modern graphics. That’s literally all I wanted, and it’s what I got, so I’m pretty happy."
