I live in the southeast part of town, the area with the least amount of crime, and a few times a year I see people on my cameras checking car doors in the middle of the night.  Seems like once a month the news has a story about someone complaining that the guns they kept in their unlocked car were stolen."

It was great, blockbuster was on the way home from work and I knew exactly what game I was getting, unlike Gamefly.  Game Pass is the first service I've used since then that improves upon what Blockbuster offered, IMO."

This is the person who, when asked why she hadn't dropped out of the Democratic primaries in 2008 when it was clear Obama was going to get the nomination, said (I'm paraphrasing here) ""Well, Robert Kennedy was assassinated in June, so anything could happen."""
PleX,ffacyym,t1_ffaaf2u,1579732625.0,"After he died I was at a senior leadership conference and the speaker was singing his praises, this was a conference that supposed to be about being good leaders and creating a safe and productive workplace.  Kept singing his praises over and over and finally I, much too loudly, said to our attorney, ""Wasn't fired for being a total dick and creating a hostile work environment?""  Visionary?  Yes.  Dick?  Yes.  I wouldn't describe him as someone I would want to work for, but I would want him on my side."

SiouxFalls,ffa94gy,t1_ffa4f6d,1579730292.0,"Source?  If this were true I would expect SFPD to do regular patrols on the East and South side of towns, but unless they get a call to those areas, the entire southeast portion of town doesn't get any regular patrols because there's no need for it.  [This](https://www.crimemapping.com/map/sd/siouxfalls) map seems to support SFPD's decision not to patrol south of 26th on the east side and southeast of 229."
baseball,ffa73rs,t1_ffa0otm,1579729164.0,"I'm not crying for them, I'm saying that these guys are going to lose tens of millions of dollars in lifetime earnings and that serves as a pretty big deterrence to other managers and GM's.  Alex Cora probably doesn't get another managerial gig since he was hired to bring some of the Houston magic to Boston which he apparently did in the form of copying their tactics.  Carlos Beltran, I think, has the best shot at another managerial gig, he's the only player involved being punished at this point and his punishment being on the same level as the other three feels weird to me."
politics,ffa5vaf,t1_ff9w3v3,1579728484.0,"I'm not saying immigration didn't play a factor, but FFS, we call those states the Rust Belt because of what happened to the local economies as a result of NAFTA and globalization.  ""The economy, stupid!""  A rising tide does not lift all boats.  There are people who were definitely hurt by NAFTA and the changes brought about as a result of the dropping of international trade barriers and protections.  Nationally, perhaps immigration was the issue, but in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania I would be shocked if the number one reason people did not show up to vote for Clinton was not due to NAFTA.  That's where the election was won and lost.  80,000 votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania was the difference between a Clinton presidency and a Trump presidency."
