I say everyone can choose to believe in whatever they want but something or somebody who goes after his own kind is just so weird. Like they are doing it as a last resort to sound intelligent or to be part of something, even if it will be to join a group that is against oneself. and the worst is they would have deluded men, that actually support this ideology.

I mean like seriously it is always the same old thing ""just swap the genders and see what the outrage is"". Well it is scary how its simple to say but yet not completely accepted and then we have this bullshit happening. IDK but i get really scared by this.. anyone else?"

selfimprovement,fe4zhvy,t1_fe4vtus,1578864217.0,"Man every time I think of ,,A book that has changed my life'' it's that one. Read Siddartha too, you won't regret it."
selfimprovement,fe4ywy2,t1_fe4l2lb,1578864128.0,"Man, let me give you a story concerning that book. It was summer in Croatia 2017 when I was finishing it, and at that time I had a little heartbreak since my best friend met the girl, which I had a crush on, and after meeting her once he scored better than I did trying almost half a year. So I am pretty devastated but I kept reading this damn book. The winter before that I finished Siddartha, from which I then knew how to read Steppenwolf. So without spoiling anything here but it made me realize the biggest flaws in my life and what a Harry Haller I was. This realization instantly messed with my mind so much that I developed unbearable social anxiety, shame, and depression. I couldn't go out of my house without talking to my inner Harry in front of a mirror bathed in cold sweat and wanting to get to the paradise of poets. Well, Siddartha stuck in the back of my head and I then and there realized why this son of a bitch got 2 Nobel Prices ( i believe and like to believe it's two) for his works. Then and there my persona made a full circle and I realized it was okay being a shitty shit person as long as you know how shitty you are and want to change it. So being a Steppenwolf is not a state to stay in forever, but more a process that is necessary to develop oneself.   
I am also very excited to see that there are people who genuinely see the value in his books. What experiences did you have with Hesse?"
selfimprovement,fe3dooj,t3_eno12m,1578848373.0,Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse. Most outstanding and touching book for me in that situation. Highly recommend it
AskMen,fbd2l0j,t3_ecoalw,1576743643.0,"Please elaborate on how rough you like it. BC usually you can say be more dominant and rough which is perfectly fine if he is a mature guy. BUT BUT BUT, My friends and I have experienced where the partner was into being hit... with a fist... to the face and stomach... Now if we are talking about this kind of rough it takes great balls to actually do it. I mean, going for a slap to the cheeks or obviously spanking and stuff like that is acceptable with consent. But as a rather strong person hitting a 1,55m rather fragile woman and her demanding for harder hits and to make a fist while doing it is incredibly dangerous and suspicious. It's important to make clear what ROUGH means for you."
