stretch a lot. foam roll

body-weight exercises, modify as needed. pull-ups, push-ups, burpees, lunges, etc

walk

clean up diet and reduce caloric intake

super boring stuff but it works. once you make a solid dent with the above THEN start a run/walk

need inspiration? look to Jocko Willink. his books, IG, podcasts, etc. motivation is fleeting, instead focus on discipline. Discipline equals freedom"
