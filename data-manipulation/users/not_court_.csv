nystagmus,fffuyoh,t3_et7t61,1579892360.0,"While I can watch my eye move in a mirror it is slower than what you’re describing. Mine is from birth so symptoms change between acquired. If I were you I would go to the doctor immediately. When my parents noticed mine when I was a baby, they took me to the emergency room. The doctors first thought I had been bit by a scorpion or rattle snake (arizona) but it just turned out I had multiple eye conditions. A lot of things could be causing this and if I was in your shoes I would take no chances since this could, not meaning to scare you, cost you sight if it is something. Even a nystagmus should be diagnosed. Go to the doctor and leave google behind"
