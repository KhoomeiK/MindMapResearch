That's not to say it should live in a shitty situation for the sake of being kept alive, just that there's not always the same high standard of living.

Horses that are left outside don't need blankets. Their winter coats will grow in and keep them warm. Putting a blanket on a horse inhibits the coat growth and will make it dependent on blankets, which allegedly it's not getting enough care to warrant."

Does it have access to clean water?
Is the area it's living in cleaned of waste?
Is it being cared for (hooves and teeth getting done)?
Does it have enough room for exercise (which if it's full of waste the answer is no)?

I'd avoid the shelter and blankets bit. Some breeds don't need to be blanketed as long as they're not clipped (which this horse clearly isn't) and the shelter is really only needed to shield it from rain or snow. Mentioning those things will distract from the issues above which are major concerns."

I get the theory of rather having a gun if I ever need one than not and that some situations aren't foreseeable, but it's just not something I dwell on. There was a point when I had it where I was leaving the house and thought 'I better take my gun since this isn't the greatest area' and immediately decided I just shouldn't go instead. From that point on my decision making was much more about whether it was safe, period, instead of whether I should take a gun."

I've worked at other places where the conference room is your open office so any client calls feature a ton of background noise on your end.

Recently I had a conversation with my wife where I told her I feel like everything is a potentially volatile situation and I feel like no matter what I do will be lose/lose. It's very anxiety-inducing and exhausting, which only adds to the stress. Then when something does go wrong, I'm apathetic because it just seemed inevitable, which then upsets her and makes her feel like I don't care.

AskReddit,ff408lq,t1_ff3uecr,1579552711.0,"> In a coffee shop you walk into the store and immediately get in line. It's definitely more of a ""first come first served"" situation.

Would that not be the exact same situation for lining up in a checkout lane? First come, first served to be rung up by the cashier? You're waiting in line to be checked out, the same as if you enter a coffee shop and are waiting in line to have your order taken. They just put in an express lane to expedite people that are only buying a few items, the same way a coffee shop could put in an express lane for people only purchasing coffee and not requiring the espresso machine.

Suppose a coffee shop were to keep a section of their counter stocked with black coffee so that people who want just that can grab it and go without waiting in line. And every time someone takes a coffee, an employee fills up another cup and puts it up. It's the same concept as the prepared foods at a convenience store like Wawa or Sheetz. That still requires employees dedicated to servicing that instead of making sandwiches that are ordered through the POS system. Do you take issue with that?"

askphilosophy,fezb2ig,t1_feymx7m,1579455556.0,"I think to do this conversation justice we need shift the topic from ""advertising"" to ""communication"", because advertising can communicate a wide variety of things for a wide variety of purposes. Simply being listed in the phone book would be considered ""advertising"" but is communicating that you exist under a directory unethical? After all, if someone needs a plumber, wouldn't you offering your ability to help address their need be the ethical thing to do?

The question of ethics really comes into play with regards to the message being communicated and/or the intent of the communication itself. Without ""advertising"" would we be aware of new products or services that are useful or beneficial to our lives? Conversely, are our lives impacted negatively by debt we incur by purchasing things that are advertised to us as worth being indebted for?

We forget that advertising in its most essential form is communication, because often times the information being communicated is meant to manipulate or instigate behavior from what would have been the presumed default. But I don't think ""advertising"" can be typified consistently enough to make any kind of broad ethical argument for or against."

Also, it's easy to see the synergy between the original Netflix model and Blockbuster, but there's also a significant risk in the overhead being assumed. It's not like Blockbuster would be mailing the DVDs out from the stores. They're now assuming the overhead of all the warehouses and employees that handle the distribution which is a completely new component.

It's easy in hindsight to see how obvious the opportunity was, but at the time you don't have the benefit of understanding what will change.

It's just the problems that I have with this house is that every time I try to accomplish something (like replacing the faucet because the valve leaks), I end up encountering a bigger project (like adding a shut off, so that I can then replace the valve).

We have a detached garage and behind it the dirt has built up so that it's a good 12"" up the rear wall. I figured I'd go back there and clear out some of the dirt, build a drainage channel for the time being, and then figure out what to do later. Grab a pick and shovel and get to work. Well, first I had to clear away all the old branches and whatever else they just dumped behind it (it was pretty overgrown so I wasn't sure what was all in there). Get that all cleared away and cut down all the weeds and shrubs. Now I start to dig and I encounter plastic, like a very large sheet that was buried. So I have to unbury that (it was probably about 60 square feet) only to find out that there was some kind of makeshift brick patio underneath it. And by that I mean they just laid bricks down, not even really level, until the whole area was covered. After removing all of those I find there's tile underneath the brick. Ok, remove that (which we're now on like day 3 of what I figured would be a 4 hour project) and encounter a vegetation barrier under the entire area. And underneath that is some gravel fill, which I'm guessing they used to initially level the area. So now I need to get a bobcat or some kind of machinery in to regrade the entire area. And the most mind blowing part is that means all this stuff was done INTENTIONALLY to elevate the ground behind the garage above the siding, with apparently no consideration for the inevitable rotting out of the wood in the wall and water getting into the garage (which is what clued me in to the issue in the first place)."

I'm pretty handy when it comes to fixing things. I can usually figure out a way to deal with something and then look up online anything I'm not sure about. But this house is just a nightmare. Even contractors when they come in are amazed by what they find. We have an in-law suite and we had to take the floor up. There are 2 rooms in the in-law suite. One has a brick subfloor. The other is 2x2s, with no insulation, and they're not even screwed into the studs, they're just laying on the concrete pad.

I think for millenials it's less about dealing with negative events and more with constantly being the victims of predatory behavior and misinformation. I graduated high school being told that if I went to college and got a degree, everything else would work out. I've seen people not graduate, but still drown in student loan debt. I've seen people graduate and suffer a significant medical issue, only to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I've seen people get degrees only to not be able to find a job and have to go back to school. I've seen people that somehow avoided all that only to still be struggling financially to pay their student loans, rent, cell phone bill and any other financial obligations.

I've wanted a family and we got to the point where we just had to trust that we've been able to make our way this far, and many other people are successful in much worse circumstances, so we will make it work. That's not to try to talk you into anything, just a general attitude towards life I've been trying to adopt. I think our generation (I'm 34, my wife is 35) is overly cautious and was forced to become excessively self reliant because all the ""conventional wisdom"" was no longer applicable when we started assuming responsibility.

I come from a modest middle class background. Everyone said go to college and you'll be fine. And while it's ultimately worked out, I graduated in 2008 and worked on a paving crew until I had enough money saved up to afford a $10/hour internship to get into my industry. My mother-in-law has no money and we're forced to provide for her. When you tell people what we've been through the consensus is usually ""well it shouldn't have been like that"" but it was. And so now we're overly cautious, and I'd expect you and your fiance to be similar given your ages. It's a whole new world and to some extent we're like the generation that lost everything in the Great Depression. We're now overly skeptical of anything and overly cautious at assuming responsibility, because we expect it to be predatory in nature."
