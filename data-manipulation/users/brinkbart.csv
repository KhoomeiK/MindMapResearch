Sure enough, now I see it. If she had just drawn Prudence doing the pose in her usual shitty, jittery-line art style, I think she’d have a better defense here. Instead she tried to recreate everything about the original photo *except* the woman of color.

Honestly, if she wanted to pay homage to the photo I think she ought to have just redrawn it as-is without Prudence."
