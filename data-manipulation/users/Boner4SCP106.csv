NetflixBestOf,ff9fztd,t3_ese8xn,1579712207.0,"It really depends on the documentary for me. I watch a lot of music documentaries and if something sticks out as odd or interesting, I'll look it up. Most of the time I just let it slide for those kinds of docs. One that caught me off guard was the Bob Dylan Rolling Thunder Revue. There's a lot of true things in that doc and stuff that's just flat out made up as a joke? 

If it's something more serious, I try not to take it fully at face value and will look up stuff more often. 

I think documentaries are a good educational resource, but I think it's rare that whoever makes them doesn't have some sort of agenda whether it's minor or major. I think it's good to verify the info presented and/or figure out the inner working of whatever doc it is. I think that's part of the fun of it as well."
