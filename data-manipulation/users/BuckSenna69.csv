I've been hoping for some time that someone specific would say something similar to me and they also just popped back up after a year of not seeing them. And they won't speak to or acknowledge me now lol. 

I can tell you that you should just say something. Literally anything, to them. On your own time, of course. You have nothing to lose and everything to repair. Leaving stuff in the air is one of the worst decisions you can make. You gotta at least try to make conversation and see what happens. At least for yourself. To let it off your shoulders. But when you need to. Just don't let that clock keep ticking off, though. Resolve yourself to at least acknowleding them. Show them they exist to you. Because it probably really sucks thinking they dont."
