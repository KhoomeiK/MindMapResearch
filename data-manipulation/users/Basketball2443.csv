depression,ferxttu,t3_eqenne,1579359403.0,"Holy shit I related to this so hard. I was already not the best at talking before, but ever since I’ve been severely depressed I feel like I can barely make sense when I talk. It’s hard for me to ever express how I’m feeling when I’m talking to anyone which just makes me feel stupid and more alone. I kinda wish I had a therapist to talk to and try to understand me. I go to a psychiatrist once every few months and it’s obvious he really doesn’t give a shit and then just prescribed me to something new each time."
depression,ferve68,t3_eqcgwk,1579358715.0,"I’m just as pathetic as you when it comes to girls and I’ve also never dated, held hands etc. but the good news is you’re not too old yet. You can still find a girl and settle down, have kids and whatever. The thing I tell myself to give me hope is, all it takes is one girl to say yes. Even if I ask out 20 girls and get rejected, if one of them gives me a chance then I’ll be happy. Unfortunately I ask 0 girls out so I give myself a 0% chance. And I’ll probably end up forever alone. I honestly don’t even know why I started commenting on something I have no knowledge with. But all I can say is you’re not alone"

depression,ferstoa,t3_eqcju4,1579357988.0,Or people will act like they understand but they really don’t. It feels like people that want to live just can’t understand people who dread living

socialanxiety,fed9jvd,t3_eoidzo,1579004739.0,"Social anxiety sucks. There’s a bunch of things to try but no actual cure. I’ve tried so many things to no success. All I can say is fuck feeling like this. The next thing I’m going to try is improving my confidence, hopefully that helps a little"
socialanxiety,fed3lbx,t3_eoeumj,1578997100.0,You’re definitely not alone. I can guarantee I’m much more awkward and pathetic than you. Every social encounter I have turns uncomfortably awkward. I also thought when I was a teen that everything would be fine as I get older but it’s only gotten worse. I’m only 22 so I know I still have time to improve but as of rn social anxiety has made me completely isolated and I feel to close to no one.
