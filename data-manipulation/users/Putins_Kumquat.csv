The glycoprotein chains with regards to the reference to HIV is simply stating that because it walks like a coronavirus, looks like a coronavirus, doesn't mean we know what to do when it doesn't behave like a coronavirus. So first easy assumption that has a good probability is transferring genetic crosstalk in a lysogenic co-habited  host cell.
  
So we are looking for a virus who requires the following attributes:

  
1) recorded history of crossing superspecies kingdoms and effective transmission into a new host of a new species. 
  
2) Once in, reverse transcribe RNA into DNA with a preferably prolonged incubation period. Semi-conservative with crosstalk neighbor virus. Also the RNA reverse transcription has to place the new DNA fragments of each virus in the same loci on the same chromosome and literally right next to each other to exchange this many times and and large DNA fragments to code for these massive glycoproteins. 
  
I think it also said something about folding but I'm on my phone right now cooking dinner and can't get to the paper at the moment. 
  
3) Resilience outside of a host and able to survive for an above average period of time without it being destroyed and still capable of infection. Must be also resilient to weather extremes and quick changes in environment extremes (Southern China is hot and humid in the summer with typhoons bringing lots of rain and freezing cold snow storms with heavy rains in the winter and spring all with a lot of heavy metals in the air from the pollution). 
  
* I'm sure there are other characteristics I inadvertently left out. However I think it will suffice for the explanation of this scenario. By that I mean if you take process of elimination of all viruses we have documented since the first discovery, I think the potential for a crosstalk suitor would probably not exactly result in a lot of options. At least that is what I got from the paper and please correct me if I am not correct."

The problem with HIV is that not only do you have 2 different mechanisms but those also branch and have their own subsets. The virus alone infects all of your different types of your active immune system white blood cells and shuts down the memory ones simultaneously so your body cannot develop a response. Not to mention when first infected you don't realize it until that little fucker lyses the cell and then you have a whole giant drone army this guy created while in the cell and your body would never possibly know once it's reverse transcribed to your DNA.

worldnews,fg4vy8t,t3_ewuw0b,1580512301.0,"Perhaps I can help TL;DR summarize before this starts gaslighting people based off the title alone (also research papers are not exactly a popular topic for entertainment):  
  
* *It's extremely unusual* as so it states ad nauseum throughout. It is unique in that it's evolutionary history raises questions because it's binding sites aren't like any other coronavirus or it's near cousin SARS. In fact, at 4 different loci it has a small protein chain that matches only with 4 of the subtypes of HIV-1 throughout our entire scope of humanity's research on viruses at the moment. 
  
* No this is not going to cause super aids or mean anything like a super hybrid godzilla bug that is coming to get us all. There's enough gaslighting as is with misinformation so I ask those to please don't help proliferate it. It's only going to result in more people getting sick and potentially more deaths. 
  
  
* ""*Okay, what's the point of this and binding sites being similar to HIV-1 in lethality?*"" Good question!  So these viruses are simple single stranded, giant trench coat wearing assholes that can travel very far, induce very deadly effects on the human body and/or mutate and pass off new resistance strains of a given genus much faster than technology will ever be able to catch with regards to vaccine development or just medicine to combat them. The binding site(s) play 2 specific roles: The makeup of these protein chains either determine how easily it can be transmitted between one species to another or jump from say animals to humans; and secondly, it determines how resilient they are to your immune system, and how long they can survive in extreme conditions or without a host, etc. If you are curious and want to look into this biological process, wikipedia HIV and they provide a very thorough and detailed breakdown of the differences between HIV-1 vs. HIV-2 as well as their subtypes that have branched off as it has evolved throughout history.   
  
  
* ""*Okay enough with the biology dude, just tell me what the point of this is!*"" Basically, the only way for viruses to swap information, is if one has implanted itself in a host cell and is just waiting for the right time to lyse out and infect nearby cells of the host. They are basically dormant and both HIV-1 and this coronavirus do this process often. One virus one day had to be in a host cell hibernating when the other came by and infected the same cell and were able to mix up their original parts of their RNA with one another. This is how coronavirus is expressing these 4 reactivity sites. This could also explain why it appears to be highly contagious, lethal, and most importantly, by being able to trace it back to where these two monsters crossed paths, we will be able to fast track some of the trial and error processes for vaccine development that could save lives. 
  
I'm a pharmacologist not a virologist but for what it's worth, given this info, I would wager my bet on a HIV infected chimp in either South East Asia or Africa was bit or vice versa by a bat with the coronavirus and this is how they swapped.
