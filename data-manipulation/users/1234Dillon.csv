college,ffgbqsa,t3_etgx3b,1579902734.0,"Before you go to your RA your campus should have a student resident handbook, which basically outlines all of the rules of what you can and cannot do in the dorms this will more then likely be posted on your university’s housing webpage. Find this handbook, almost all university have a rule about guests in doors because of issues like this. 

Find out what your university dorm guest policy is, if you can’t find it, you might have to go to your RA or you can just call your housing department and they should know what it is. 

Once you find out what it is, you can let your bad roommates know what the policy is and that you want them to follow it. Expect them to not listen or care. To resolve this issue you will more then likely have to get your RA involved I know thats”snitching” but you know what you need your peace of mind and there being jerks. RAs are there to be mediators and help resolve issues and rules are there because people take advantage of the system. Good luck, the RAs are there to help use them, make them be the bad guys and enforce the rules."

Catholicism,ffc1sje,t1_ffbizbn,1579789376.0,"God told us to feed the poor, trump is cutting funding to free and reduced lunches at public schools. 

God told us to take care of the sick, trump took away the affordable care act which has taken away affordable health care for millions and has stripped people with pre-existing conditions the rights to insurance. 

God told us to take care of the old, he is cutting social security benefits for senior citizens. 

God told us to educate, trump has cut funding for public school. I could go on with the things he is doing against the Bible but I will stop at 4. 

Also why shouldn’t his personality be a factor. God Instructed us to be good people. Ask yourself in your daily life would you associate yourself with a person who has cheated on multiple wives? Would you be friends with a person who knowingly sleeps with prostitutes while being married? Would you be friends with someone who constantly degrade women’s and openly says because of who he is he can “grab them by the pu$$y”. Would you be ok if you went to a party and that friend mocked a disabled person or if anyone disagrees with that friend then he just called them “idiot” or if someone showed proof of why your friend was wrong he just shouted “fake news” Or better yet ask yourself would you be ok if your local priest acted this way (minus the marriage stuff). 

If the answer is no..........then why are ok with voting for this man for the highest position in our country only because he supports only one of values of the Bible?"
Catholicism,ffbcge7,t3_esdsjm,1579759567.0,"The comments on here make me sad as a fellow catholic. We as Catholics I believe get so blind sided by the pro-life debate. Yes it is a very important topic, yes it is one of the many things that is spoken about in the Bible. I feel like we find a candidate who say they are pro-life and then we just blindly follow them no matter what other horrible awful things they may do because you know what, they are for that one thing in the Bible and I am going to shut my eyes to everything else and stand behind him. 

But what about everything else that is in the Bible? Like Taking care of one another, accepting people who are not like you, divorce, adultery, not lying, feeding the poor, helping the sick, treating people with respect no matter who they are? 

Those things are hard to do right....... it’s much easier to just stand blindly behind the candidate who says he is against the easy black and white topic like abortion. 

We are better then this........ we need to stop taking it easy and stand up for the harder issues."

college,ff3snnh,t3_erf74t,1579547990.0,"Live in a college town and can totally back this up. The cats thing is a 100% truth and if you go to the shelter like 3-4 months after the beginning of the semester you can find purebred dogs that were surrendered. It’s really sad. 

I can’t talk to much crap because I did get a dog when I was in college and when it got to be to much I did have let him go. Luckily I found someone who was much older and looking for a trained dog so I rehomed my dog with that person."
AskWomen,ff357ko,t3_eqxs0f,1579533960.0,"She was always supportive no matter what I did but authoritative. I always knew she was “in charge” and the mother not my friend and had rules that I needed to obey but if I did break the rules I would get punished but not belittled. she was always there for me through the good and the bad, showed up to all my games, performances, when I needed a ride she was there. she also kept a clear line of communication with me. If I was doing something good she would tell me, if I was doing something wrong she would tell me in a gentle way this also made me comfortable and let me open up to her. Lastly she always let us be ourself without trying to change us, she never told us who we had to be she just loved us for our own unique qualities and supported them even if she had no clue what it was. I am 30 now and my still love my relationship with my mother."

Hate to get on my high horse here but when your young you are very impressionable and there a saying “you are the company you keep” idk if you really want your 15yr son dating someone who is willing to speak to his own brother and is clearly troubled. I say this not as a “Karen” but as someone who went through it as a teenager. When I was 16 I had a BF who was “troubled” and came from a bad home and he really started to change me because of his bad attitude. Luckily my mother stepped in and told me to break up with him. I hated her at the time, but now I thank her everyday."

As a substitute teacher I see this way to much. We are in a culture now that caters to the every whim of the “disabled” but what about the other students where is there protection? You stood up to a bully and ya you will get hell for it, prob for a long time but I think you did the right thing. You put her in her place and I bet from now on she leaves you alone."

I am a wedding planner and I HATE that people do this it’s not your day go away. If you asked the bride before hand and she agrees that it’s ok then that is one thing but lord let the married couple have 24hr in the spot light. 

I do think you should reconsider not going to there wedding. It’s 9 months from now and yes it’s your 1 year anniversary but it’s only one anniversary and you have the rest of your life for all the other anniversary’s. If you go solely to get people off you back, and so people can’t shove it in your face I would say that’s a win, be the bigger person and go."
relationship_advice,fcwrnrr,t3_ej3aq7,1578034884.0,"I don’t wanna jump into the whole “you need to dumb her” because that is not helpful. 

Her mind has obviously been filled with unreasonable expectations by her parents. I think you need to have a come to Jesus moment with her and explain your expectations as a family. You both should be able to compromise. Maybe that includes you getting a prenup explaining how finance are going to be split and if either of you cheat then the other does not get anything. I know from right now me and my husband (we are the same age as you) we both have our individual account where the “fun” money goes and we have a joint account where the bills money goes and we split the household 50/50. 

Good luck, you do need to come to some kind of compromise the #1 reason for divorce is issues about money, so heads up there."

AmItheAsshole,fchlgfr,t3_eh7csf,1577651590.0,"NTA I was one of thouse stuck up brides and I really did care if someone worse white to my wedding or not I told all my people to kick anyone out of my wedding who wore white. The fact that you checked in with her before hand and she gave you the ok makes all this ridiculous. You only stood up for yourself online. She is going to be pissy with you but it’s done now and she should not have thrown you under the bus. Or if after you talked she actually had an issues with your jumpsuit then she should have said something. 

My grandma also put me in my place and told me before my wedding, “if on your wedding day you think you can be “outshined” by another person at your own wedding wearing white you have more issues then just fashion choices.”"
