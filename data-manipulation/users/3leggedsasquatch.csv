personalfinance,feyqxpn,t3_eqxi2h,1579449469.0,"Others have pointed out the 1/4-1/3 rule and my brain goes to other things to keep in mind.  Right now it seems you could swing it, but here is more about which to think.  No job is purely secure, we can all get kicked to the curb, however, how secure are you you will not be laid off, and, if you do get laid off, would what you’d receive be sufficient for paying rent?  Rent will always go up each year; will your hourly/salary also increase?  Dogs are expensive with their food and medical if they have a health concern.  Can you put money aside each week for a just in case the pupper needs help fund?  Do you have a car and, although you could walk/bike to work at this place, will you still have to pay for a parking permit at the rental?  Living with your parents I assume they pay cable and internet.  If these are things you would want in your rental, do you know what it would actually cost you?  Living with your parents I assume you eat their food, perhaps kicking in a bit for groceries, but when you’re on your own, your whole food bill comes from your pocket.  Do you know what a weekly food bill may actually cost you? Same goes for personal care items like shaving and soap, healthcare items such as pain killers or cold medicines, and also for household items such as laundry soap.  Will you have laundry facilities at this place?  Water and sewer bills can add up.  If you need to use a laundry mat, consider how much that actually costs people each week plus the pain in the butt of dragging your items back and forth.

You can save money on many things.  Make your own laundry soap.  Buy a small washing machine (if the lease allows) and hang up your laundry to dry on racks inside your rental.  Shop at discounted food places.  TV has always been free through the air with the old bunny ear antenna.  You’ll lose less heat in the winter  if you seal up holes and open your shades on sunny days and you’ll gain cool air in the summer if you open your windows when the sun goes down and the block the sun during the day.  You can furnish your place and kitchen by asking people if they have hand me downs, finding items people are throwing out that have lots of life left in them, or going to thrift stores."

WomensHealth,fev70hp,t3_eqoych,1579393854.0,"Going to a regular GYN appointment for a yearly check can be nerve wracking.  Being that you were being seen because you had a bad pain, I assume your nerves were shot.  First, you had this pain and were probably very nervous about what it means or what may be going on especially since you hadn’t been sexually active.  Second, you had to have an exam you’d never had before with strangers prodding you.  Your legs shaking seems to be a normal thing that could happen because of your nerves.  Crying was probably also a way for your body to shake off some of the nerves.  Bravo for the medical staff for doing all they could to make you feel at ease.  

I think your reaction was normal for what you went through.  Stress and trauma that isn’t normal for your body can do really crazy things.  Last time I had an IUD removed, my body shook and I barely made it to the GYN’s bathroom before everything came out from both ends.  Then I passed out on the floor.  IUD insertion and removal can be nothing at all to some women, but excruciating and traumatic for others.  Some women may have taken what you went through with a grain of salt.  You were more sensitive.  That is just you and there’s nothing wrong with your reaction.  I hope the results of the exam show nothing medically major has happened.  Hopefully your pelvic pain was just worse than normal cramps."

WomensHealth,felfy1i,t3_epro2l,1579221252.0,"You go to the dentist twice a year just for cleanings and check ups, even though you don’t have an issue.  At some point in your life you will probably get a yearly blood test, eye check, ear check, or general physical just to see if things look OK, even though you feel fine.  If you work on your feet, you may go to a chiropractor or podiatrist for a new pair of orthotics each year, even though you don’t have issues.  You can go to a chiropractor weekly or monthly for adjustments, even though you don’t have back pain.  

The point is, you have body parts that require maintaining or annual check ups from a professional.  Your lady parts are part of you body and they require a professional to make sure you are healthy.  

I don’t understand why you want to ask your mother about making an appointment.  You are an adult.  Call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask for a GYN near where you live that is in network and accepting new patients.  Your insurance company may also have a website where you can create an account and log in to have a look around yourself.  Some members may have left reviews for GYNs as well you can read."

Most of the time I now just park my cart and walk up and down an aisle grabbing things so I don’t have to bother with the too big carts.  None of the stores here have baskets or any other option besides the carts."
Home,fcil2z1,t3_d5av8h,1577664358.0,"I get these in my bathroom sink.  It took a few times of me doing this but here is what worked for me.  They eat the shampoo and gunk and goo in the drain and there are eggs down there, so more will keep coming until you clean out all the goo.  You can get rid of some of the hair by buying one of those long flexible plastic sticks that have barbs on them.  Won’t hurt your drain but hair will easily grab on the barbs and you can pull them out.  Then I filled the drain and the over flow as packed with baking soda as I could and dumped tons of vinegar in until there was no more bubbling and no more gunk coming out.  Then I dumped down several tea kettles of boiling water down the drain and overflow.

I understand it was easier for me cleaning out the overflow in a sink than it will be for you in a tub.  You can try just doing the drain and plug up the over flow if you never take baths.  That way,  if there are any living there, they won’t be able to get out.  But just be sure you never use your tub or you’ll have issues from plugging it up."

I don’t know the proper word for this thing but it could be the open door sensor thing on your truck.  Look on all your door where that little lever or stick would be that presses in when the door is closed, therefore turning off the beeping and Interior light.  Maybe one of them got knocked off and that’s what you found?"

If they’re seeds a critter is hiding for later like some posters suggested, why are they left in the open?  Critters will hide food storage in a dark corner.  I don’t think they’re pooh from any critter either.  Doesn’t look like Pooh and there aren’t enough of them plus there’d be piles of Pooh in lots of places.  This is so baffling!"
NoStupidQuestions,fcfd16x,t3_eh62vj,1577628792.0,"During the day block out the sun with a thick curtain or towel.  At night open the window to allow In the cool air and use a fan to circulate the air.  Find the diffusers or registers in your room and check if they’re open.  Maybe a pet or a robot vacuum or a broom accidentally closed the damper.  Follow the duct work to the basement or attic (where ever it is in your house) looking for a damper handle that may be now closed.  It’ll look like a little metal arm and SHOULD be parallel to the duct if it’s open. (SHOULD be, sometimes people install them backward).  Newer McMansion homes tend to be ducted with flex duct which is something that can be squished easily.  It’s just a tube made of plastic and thin metal with insulation around it.  Maybe you have that in your house and it’s mashed between beams and boxes in your attic.  Or maybe a hole got poked in it and you can use some good tape to patch the hole for now.  They other thing you can do that’s even easier than tracing the duct is to just check that your register is fully open in your room and then halfway closing the registers in everyone else’s rooms.  Don’t shut them all the way, just throttle them back a bit.

Also, use cotton sheets and, what ever you may be wearing, be sure it’s cotton.  And check your pillow and mattress materials... don’t use anything plastic.  You need natural fibers around your body to keep cooler.  Check if your mattress has a protective cover over it.  If it’s one of those plastic ones that will keep pee from absorbing in the mattress, get rid of the plastic."
WomensHealth,fcfa79g,t1_fc9a6xi,1577627983.0,"Now that I’m thinking, I do recall having my period for 5 months and was given a shot in my hip to stop the period.  I have no clue what that shot was but now I’d like to know.  Too long ago to find out, though.  It did stop that period but they just went back to being wonky, which was normal for me.

But is your period light?  Or are you bleeding heavy?  If it’s light to where you can use panty liners I think you are good.  If it’s heavy you need to worry about anemia because you’re losing too much red blood cells and iron.  Have you had a blood test just to check your levels, to see if there is concern for anything at all?  Good idea to get one every year anyway."
Advice,fcbm2op,t3_egzwxd,1577588427.0,"Fill up jugs, cleaned out milk or laundry bottles, or a small bucket and have some friends and neighbors put them in their freezer.  Then put the frozen bottles in your fridge.  Don’t open the fridge often at all, only long enough to grab what you need.

Or ask on Freecycle or just ask friends for someone who has an old fridge or look in thrift stores for a cheap one.  Truck drivers use coolers that keep 40 degrees cooler than ambient temp.  Do you know anyone who used to be a truck driver who may have their old cooler?"
