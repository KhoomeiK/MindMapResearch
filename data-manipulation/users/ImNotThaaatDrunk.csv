unpopularopinion,fejxrjm,t3_egcbze,1579188269.0,"I agree. There is little offered in the way of world building or political alignment other than Nilfgard is bad. The characters are entirely unlikable. Geralt just sneers and snarls, lacking any semblance of charisma. Yennifer is boring as shit.  I don't even know why triss is in the series. The main plot points seem to be glazed over by poorly miked actors who either mumble or slur their lines in bad accents. The magic system is poorly explained and equally executed, as is the explanation of what witchers are and where they come from. The series does a great disservice to Witcher 3 wild hunt, which gave more backstory and character development in two hours of game play than the eight episodes on Netflix. The whole series lacks warmth, personality, and effort and feels like a modern version of Hercules: the Legendary Journey."

Zemeckis: I have so many questions.

Spielberg: we all have a ton of questions. First off, is this real? This isn't like a joke script, or something your kid wrote in seventh grade English class?

RH: why can't they just go to a currency exchange on taatooine?

Z: what's up with jar jar? Why all the slapstick?

S: You're planning on retooling the dialogue right? Like, ALL the dialogue?

RH: or at least find some merchant or trader who travels to republic systems that could exchange their credits for taatoine bucks.

Z: are the gungans even necessary? You have a lot of silly and goofy characters in this, 3PO, jar jar, boss nass, watto, this feels like a cartoon.

S: you are at least planning on getting a top rated actor to play young anakin right? Someone who can play a twelve year old? With plenty of prior experience?

RH: or qui Gonn could at least sell the queens fancy ship for something more pedestrian but with a working hyper drive right?

Z: tell me this Darth maul character isn't just another Boba fett ploy to sell action figures.

S: you weren't sober when you wrote this, we're you?
