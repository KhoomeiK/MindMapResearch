Whisper's advice is solid; your *behavior* is a very important channel for broadcasting your SMV and RMV to potential suitors.  Work on understanding the body language you're projecting, and that of others.  Learn more about how and when to give IOIs and how to telegraph your relationship availability.  This is not a call to make yourself available for *sex.*  Rather, a reminder that skills at projecting approachability can be learned and improved upon.  It's a game of getting prospects interested in you, then [vetting them](http://archive.is/aKr37) and choosing carefully who is worthy of submitting to.
