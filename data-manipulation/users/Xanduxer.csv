awfuleverything,ffeql5u,t1_ffepfns,1579860589.0,I read somewhere thatthere arent true plant based black hennas. Just deep indigo. So if henna ink is straight black then it has toxic shit in it. That being said I cant rrmember wherr I read that so I could be wrong.

But it was last year when watching some YT videos about the game did it hit me, no russian = no speak russian.

Granted i was an early teen when i  played the game or paid attention to the story and back then I didn't understand english that well."
techsupport,ffa5vz9,t3_esh4r0,1579728495.0,"And now all works. I paniced a little bit too early.

Had to change my onboard settings to mamually support m.2 not just Auto. 

Also updated bios bc why not.

 Attached my gpu power wires with a loop of velcro to the stiff motherboard 24pin cable to eliminate gpu hang. 

This whole procedure because I wanted to copy why whole ssd to m.2"
techsupport,ffa000b,t1_ff9znrq,1579725117.0,Yep me being a dum bum and assuming it works with gpu. Took that out and connected directly to the MB and I can now see bios.

Now the bios wont detect m.2 as bootable device... trying to update bios if that helps with it...."

Showerthoughts,feyjern,t3_eqt38y,1579446275.0,I actually think about thisbquite often. Like how i just see people walking on the street. That is how they perceive me as well. Just a thing going past them not knowing really if I am a person with a life or some npc in this simulation.

ChoosingBeggars,fexcwnk,t1_fewmyd4,1579428851.0,But the kid came with the mother but he would have not wanted the kid but had to take it for the mother. Also you gotta remember that these people usually don't text with the most cohesive or correct English.

gaming,fex9dld,t3_eqsylp,1579427208.0,Steam controller is the most comfortable  controller i have ever used. It just fits my hand perfectly and I just love the trackpad. Also the flaps on the back and the costomization of the buttons is sooo good.

Also that 3rd phase seems to let you take so many shots at the boss while it does nothing. Also that under slide manouver seems to be very effectiv as the bos takes long to turn around. Maybe in second phase have the boss to sweep with its back leg or a stab if you stay put too long after the slide."
Games,feq9sb9,t1_feoypse,1579339240.0,"This innaccurate and completely depends on the company. I do not know how things are in the US but there are actusl laws in EU that companies need to follow.

 Atleast at a big game studio I worked for couple of years back, everytime I did overtime i would get that added to my vacay time and other free times, also the company paid the overtime food.

I remember hearin one guy not leaving during crunch and the company actually sending him home. Same guy had like 12 bonus vacay days and he was almost forced to take a break and rest."
