AskWomen,ff9k1y6,t3_es99h3,1579714662.0,"At 27 (28 in March) I feel like my life is nowhere near settled. I still have strides to make in my career and my love life is still in the dating/sorting through prospects stage. Could be in a better place with my health/fitness too. So many of the women in my life are settling down, finding love, getting married, having babies, and making good money. I love them all so I’m happy for them, but like you said, I’m also a little sad for me."

relationship_advice,ff6a6fo,t3_ertsws,1579622715.0,"I just wanted to say I’m so sorry that this turned out so... insane. He sounds like an idiot and I cannot believe this guy is 29 years old. He is acting like a child. And his hesitancy About feeling “gay” because of boxers is so problematic. I was going to say that I didn’t understand how he could end up in a relationship with someone who is bi, but now I’m realizing he probably thought it was awesome because he was viewing you as a sex object and not as a person.

I am so, so sorry. I really hope you find someone who is worth your time."
AskRedditAfterDark,ff4g626,t1_ff48svv,1579562821.0,"Oh no! Don’t hate your body, please. You dropped off the rest of what I said “...with a true hourglass shape.” My large breasts suit my very curvy body. I’m sure yours suit you as well."

sex,ff3crnx,t1_ff3bidi,1579538557.0,"I’m pretty sure he knows. When we first started hanging out (about 7 months ago) he wanted to explore being FWB but I told him I had some feelings so it would be too complicated and I needed to protect my sensitive heart. And as I said, I straight up love him. I try to let him know that in a respectful way consistently."
AskRedditAfterDark,ff3c8eg,t1_ff334bs,1579538289.0,"As a big-breasted lady I say, THANK YOU. There have actually been A LOT of posts on reddit about guys being kind of anti-big breasts and it’s honestly gotten me feeling badly about myself sometimes. I have also come across it in real life too, where suddenly every man is an ass man (an area in which I am not really well-endowed). I cannot control the size and shape of my breasts, nipples, and areola without surgery, so what I’ve got is what I’ve got. Also, I would NOT look good with small boobs. I’m 5’7” and a true hourglass shape."
sex,ff3at3e,t1_ff38zrv,1579537574.0,"I’m honestly not sure. Though I suppose his BELIEF that he can’t be a good partner in and of itself precludes him from being a good partner.

Sometimes I think it’s his own feelings of inadequacy that’s holding him back. He has recently made big changes with his career path so he’s trying to get that on track. He also has ADHD which wasn’t diagnosed until college, so he seems to have some insecurities about his intelligence. Sometimes I think he questions his worth.

He also had a string of several VERY bad relationships (I’m talking manipulation, abandonment, threats on his life, and negative affects on his business and financial situation) that lasted years and never spent much time being single. So I think he’s just not emotionally ready. Probably frightened to be so vulnerable and open again. Funny thing is, he is quite vulnerable with me. He tells me things that he isn’t normally comfortable telling other people (he has even expressed surprise at this) - I have a way of making him feel comfortable and safe enough to open up.

As for what I can do for him? I guess really all I can do is just be here for him. Show him that I love him, that he can trust me, and that I would never hurt him like that. Give him encouragement and words of affirmation. The rest I think he has to do on his own."
AskRedditAfterDark,ff38yya,t3_erd04l,1579536502.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve had a partner I could do this with, but yes!  It feels very intimate, to be nude and vulnerable without sex being involved. My ex and I used to kiss and touch each other in non-sexual ways in the shower and it was lovely."
sex,ff364al,t3_er8hn1,1579534585.0,"Hooray! 

I have a friend like this, but he’s always saying how he is not ready to be in a relationship as he currently is not capable of being a good partner. I told him I couldn’t sleep with him if he wasn’t capable of really dating me. So alas, no sex for us (with the exception of a jumbled attempt at oral once that didn’t go very far). At this point, probably the only way we’d get together is if he were to figure his stuff out and admit he has feelings.

I’m glad things are working out for you!"
AskWomen,ff2bxsf,t3_eqxs0f,1579500115.0,"Similarly to other posters, my mom has always been very supportive of me. She has always been open and honest, and has encouraged me to be true to who I am. She had rules, but was not overly strict. She is also one of the most nurturing and loving people I have ever met in my entire life. She made so many sacrifices for us and still tries to spoil us rotten, even though we’re adults. I know that my happiness is what’s most important to her.

I’ve always been extremely close with my mom and still am. I’m sure I always will be."
dating_advice,ff0sq3y,t3_eqv3tl,1579471953.0,"I promise, you’re not alone. I (27F) did have a serious relationship for a little over a year in college, and then an almost relationship just a few months ago. Dating has been discouraging, as like you said, wading through the men who only want a fuck has been tiresome. My cousin (also 27F) had the same experience with online dating.

I have just more recently started meeting guys who actually seem like they want something more. I have learned my lesson though - free dating apps are not the way to go. There were times that the discouragement was so strong that I started to make concessions on who I am. Learn from my mistake and don’t do that.

Some other users gave you some great advice, I think. Continue doing things you enjoy with people you enjoy, and just put yourself out there. Best of luck to you, and chin up!"
dating,fet08fx,t1_fequsf4,1579370616.0,"I feel this response SO MUCH. Relate 100%. I love sex, but there are certain things that need to be in place before I am comfortable having sex with a particular person.

And about the friends bit: like you said, girls do those things for each other all the time. Me and my girlfriends even pay for each other. I do all the same things with my close guy friend. I literally just bought him a birthday gift. We go out for meals, we share meals at our homes. We go to movies, go to bars, play pool, have heart-to-hearts, run errands together, exercise together, do favors for each other... and in all of this, sometimes he pays, sometimes I pay. I don’t understand why there are people who don’t understand/believe that true hetero friendships are a real thing."

Now I’ve recently met someone who claims he can’t cum from  BJ unless he is also doing something to his partner. However he also admitted that all the women he’s been with seemed reluctant to give a BJ (he always had to ask). Challenge accepted."

offmychest,fehuftp,t3_ep5d4a,1579124085.0,"So sorry you’re going through this. It’s wild to me that someone could try and say you’re bigoted when you tried to make the marriage work and you clearly (from the language you use) are supportive of trans people.

You went into your marriage believing you were marrying a man. It’s reasonable for you to have a difficult time adjusting to finding out that your husband is actually a woman, especially if you identify as a straight woman, yourself. And even if you were into women as well, that doesn’t mean you have to be okay with having a romantic relationship with a trans woman. There are a lot of extra considerations to be made when being romantically involved with a trans person. Not everyone is built to handle that, and that is okay. It doesn’t make them bigoted, it just makes them incompatible."

AskRedditAfterDark,fe3jy3b,t1_fe3ewce,1578849942.0,"Yeah, I think I have. There have been times when I was so turned on and ready (after a couple of external orgasms usually) that as soon as the head of the penis gets near my G-pot I’m melted butter.

There is definitely a difference in dryness/friction pain versus stretching pain. The latter doesn’t usually last long once things start getting stimulated and you’re psychologically in it. The friction pain burns and stings like crazy and doesn’t go away if you go long enough without lubricating. Basically a friction rash in your vagina. No bueno."
AskMen,fe2rqfu,t3_enlczz,1578842151.0,"We just met this past summer and clicked immediately. There was mutual interest and he had asked me if I would go on a date with him, however he also informed me that he was not in a good place for a committed relationship. He had (seven months prior) just ended a string (years) of really terrible relationships and was working on changing directions in his career. So he explained that he did not feel capable of being a good partner to anyone for the time being and was instead looking for casual relationships. I told him that casual wasn’t really my thing and that if we slept together, I would definitely “catch feelings” since I already cared about him. I caught feelings anyway. 

Fast forward through through a bunch of craziness (including us almost sleeping together but stopping at fooling around) to now. He is living in another state (the state he grew up in and the state my siblings moved to) for an extended time, if not forever. We see each other about once a month for 2-3 days at a time. We are extremely close. We have no secrets and can be ourselves with each other, in a way we can’t be with other people. We have a special connection. People often think we’re married or that there is something going on between us.

I love him very, very much. He is my friend and one of the people in my life most dear to me. Unfortunately, I also still have romantic feelings for him, but I know we can’t be together with the way things are now. So for me, I’m still not quite over it. I’m working on it and I’m dating to find someone who is capable of being the partner I deserve."

sex,fdygbn6,t3_en8a3g,1578779524.0,"Definitely. I love men. I crave penetration. But I find straight porn to be too focused on the male experience. A lot of the time the girls are just “taking it.” I wanna see the focus being on the woman’s pleasure sometimes, and girl-on-girl seems to be the best bet. Also, I love scissoring videos. I think that’s because I LOVE to grind (it honestly gets me going psychologically), but hardly get to do that with a partner because it doesn’t do much for them."
sex,fdyfm50,t1_fdwhlqb,1578779258.0,"I agree! I think girl-on-girl gets me off better than straight porn, even though I love men. Lol! Like you said, I think it’s because mainstream hetero porn tends to focus on the pleasure of the man and has a lot of shots where the woman just “takes it.” It’s hot to see women getting off exactly the way they like, exactly the way I like."

sex,fdvx2v7,t3_en29vf,1578752679.0,"My shower sex experience wasn’t completely terrible, but it wasn’t great. I’m not a small lady (5’7” and non-narrow true hourglass frame) and my partner was decently tall (about 6’1”) so the shower was a bit cramped. Very difficult to get into the correct position. It was a lot of work for me and my legs started to cramp up lol. Now, if we were in one of those big spa-style showers, I could see how it would be amazing.

On another note: a larger bathtub (especially one with whirlpool jets) is a lovely place to get fingered. That was a great experience."

AskRedditAfterDark,fdrmb6w,t1_fdrin85,1578686510.0," 100% agree. It’s mostly the cruelty of others that makes us hate and question our bodies.

I’m not afraid to remind a guy that I am a real life person, not a porn star in a sexual fantasy film. Sometimes there’s going to be body hair. I’m not going to have a bleached asshole. Sometimes I’m bloated. I have scars from ingrown hairs due to incessant shaving because I was made feel that public hair was gross. I’ve got extra weight and stretch marks. I’m not always going to look 100%.

Just telling her you love her pussy, getting all up in it with abandon, tell her you can’t wait to eat it or to get in it. Just make sure you do this during sex, when she’s naked, and at unexpected times. If you do it right after she expresses her insecurity about it, she might think you’re just placating her. The only way I could see it working at that point is to look her dead in the eye with a sexy stare when you say it, and then go to town on her. That might actually be pretty hot.
