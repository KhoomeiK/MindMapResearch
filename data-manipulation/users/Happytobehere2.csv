We all need to be seen and looked at this deeply for the first 5 years of our lives. Deep.  This connection and attachment is the recipe for a loving, kind world.  Beautiful to experience. Thank you."

With it will be all the poison we have been projecting and inflicting on the world and each other.  Once this happens I really see the USA becoming slowly the idea she was imagined and we the people that hold human life, all human life as sacred.  That we step up and mold the world and our planet especially, into a new world order with love as or guide and fear released into the cosmo's.  A girl can dream.."
Dodgers,fen7hv7,t3_epq8uw,1579278661.0,"This whole cheating scandal makes me sick to my stomach. Football lost it's charm and now too baseball.  Where is the outrage from the other teams?  Being told to keep their mouths shut and not tweet or say anything? Come on now.  If you don't care why should I? Players, its your game.  Police it and make players accountable. Thanks, Alex.  Perhaps baseball can raise its bar and you can pitch to people who deserve and earned to be there on actual merit, who keep their job by working hard, hustling, catching the ball and hitting an unknown pitch with your hand eye coordination (supposedly your super power) vs cheating."

TrueReddit,fdno02g,t3_em54j2,1578589722.0,"I believe that all the institution's we have been raised on are all smoke screens.  We are starting to see this and we don't know how to respond.  Baseball and our politicians are the blights leading it today.  People lie, cheat, steal, hurt, disparage each other and as do companies. We are all everyday one upping each other and squeezing every last dime out of each other to do it.  We don't really do anything except buy stuff.  Food, restaurants gadgets, clothes, cars etc. Then we have them and we are still unhappy and so we have to buy something else, then the same thing again.  Making money to spend money and then post it for relevance.  Likes give us the fake high and we do it all again.  Feels like we are missing meaning, reverence and true connection."

JordanPeterson,fdhn4ri,t3_el3e69,1578426168.0,"We all see and hear things through our own lens.  He called out some shit.  They heard it.  He was not booed off the stage.  True or not they allowed him to say what he wanted and the agenda he wanted to push.  No one walked out or  put their fingers in their ears and said nanananan.  Perhaps we can all start to hear some truths as other people see and live them.   Examine our beliefs and make adjustments where needed.  After all, we all in this together."
JordanPeterson,fdhmiwj,t3_el8zz0,1578425803.0,This is wonderful to hear. There is more work to be done. I will say my concern with these happy phones are the disconnect I am seeing in parents and  kids.  I see little babies competing with a phone for attention.  Moms and dads need to be looking in their kids eyes and connecting on a deep meaningful level. Up to 5 years old at the very least. Eye to eye.  Soul to soul.  We will see in 20 years how absolutely avoidant we will be as a society.  I hope I'm wrong.

It opens up to so many more issues that need to be addressed.  Who, running for President is speaking directly to this problem? How do ""we the people"" help to make it better for all?  Profits are at an all time high. Perhaps this is the word that can be looked at.  We can do better by all with a bit less ""profit"" as the panacea."
