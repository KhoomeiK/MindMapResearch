Trufemcels,ff9xlvv,t3_erwb3r,1579723710.0,Stop attacking me so much
Trufemcels,ff9xhcu,t1_ff99fkc,1579723633.0,Final stage cancer doesn't sound too bad bc then I'd know that I'd die very soon anyway. Honestly I'd rather have that than depression.
depression_help,ff13ysc,t3_eqs02y,1579474987.0,"Hey I am having exactly the same problem. If I knew there was no hell, I wouldn't be here anymore. Idk how to help honestly. I would say do your research on every belief and religion and you will maybe find sth that convinces you. 
Maybe it will relieve you,maybe it will give you a point in life/reason to live. Stay strong and fight. Try to keep a healthy lifestyle. I am still going through an existential crisis."
Trufemcels,fevjdi0,t3_eqof4w,1579398108.0,It's not accurate because I tried out a photo of Madison Beer and it said only sth like 70% but she is at least 90% because she is a flawless Giga Stacy.
Trufemcels,fevivxl,t3_eqhxdg,1579397939.0,"Oh one time when I went to a restaurant with my Stacy friend, the cashier told her how pretty she is although I was standing next to her. It really hurts especially when you know that you are ugly.
I am sorry that destroyed how you feel about yourself, it is really tactless to call someone pretty while someone else (especially when she is not as pretty as her) stands next to them. Next time when this happens tell yourself ""maybe I am just not her type/taste. Maybe she likes that look or this and that better. It is enough when I find myself pretty."" I hope next time you feel good about yourself and that sth like that won't happen, bc it makes one feel like you are doomed to feeling insecure."
Trufemcels,fevhgoi,t3_eqkzrf,1579397502.0,I think the only way to avoid crushes is to avoid having guy friends. I mean you can still get a crush on guys but at least you won't fall in love. Therefore you need a connection with someone. So it wouldn't hurt you or bother you much if he wasn't interested in you bc you would have no feelings for him.
Trufemcels,feqduco,t1_feowahz,1579340621.0,"Yeah prominent just means bigger than the average nose, can be long, wide, hooked, big. But prominent doesn't necessarily mean all of them together can be just one. Sorry, explained wrong. Idk Giselle Bundchen is not a Stacy in my eyes.. But I found one with a prominent nose: Kirsten Collins."
Subliminal,fejgcl9,t3_eotkmo,1579172927.0,What do you mean with bundles?
Subliminal,fejg7tk,t3_ep4npv,1579172744.0,"I wouldn't do that, it would be like black magic. I mean I am sure you also don't want someone else to use a subliminal to make you attracted or falling in love with them."
ugly,feicaw7,t3_em07r7,1579135162.0,"This means you have a big brain and hence you are fucking intelligent and some people find intelligence sexy, so you won."
ugly,feic29g,t1_fdtmf53,1579135001.0,doesn't look that bad lol
ugly,feiba75,t3_emv80u,1579134478.0,"You are so right, can relate. I trust no one."
DysmorphicDisorder,fei9al0,t1_fei6q8s,1579133159.0,"I guess it is his eyes and more defined bone structure. He looks confident, you look insecure and kinda sad or tired. You are still not ugly you have distorted view of yourself."
DysmorphicDisorder,fei6fwt,t3_epadz3,1579131325.0,"Idk to me you look better than the one in the middle. Maybe you are just not his type, it is normal."
Trufemcels,fei5i2u,t1_feafa3i,1579130728.0,I want gay guy friends
depression,feg1p70,t3_eoow10,1579073125.0,"Me, too. I used to think that I will never commit suicide no matter how much I suffer but recently I realized that I was just fooling myself and it's a matter of time.

You don't deserve pain and humiliation just bc you're depressed and your mind says so. Don't listen to him in this case or as soon as you think this stuff imagine someone understanding in your head and make him explain the things to you and comfort you. You have a criticizing voice and a comforting voice. And this is not a pity or attention seeking post. It is a call for help and that is good!"
depression,feg1k5y,t3_eoub2g,1579072969.0,You can do it too. Maybe you just need more time for that due to these circumstances.
depression,feg1877,t3_eorigf,1579072579.0,"I wouldn'talk to parents about personal problems because they don't understand it. But they will see how wrong they were and wish they could turn back time and comfort you, if you commited suicide. Also don't listen to him, you already have it bad, I mean depression is cruel. Depression is not being ungrateful, it is being in pain and suffering from an illness. If it was physical pain, he wouldn't say that. You have your own struggles other people have their struggles. So what when other people have it worse? There are also ppl that have it better, should they stop being happy?"
Trufemcels,fef65jz,t1_fef4vba,1579049100.0,Nooo don't immediately assume that. It might take a bit longer for you to find a job but you will find one. Don't give up. I mean everyone has to work somehow.
Trufemcels,fef3nu3,t1_fef1hhy,1579047415.0,Is the unemployment part true tho? Are a lot of femcels unemployed? Would suck for me.
Trufemcels,fef06ok,t1_feegtaa,1579045101.0,wanna seeee
Trufemcels,feei6vx,t1_feegtaa,1579034254.0,Sure
Trufemcels,feegadk,t3_eoqo51,1579033153.0,"Stacies with thin lips and negative canthal tilts exist. But I have never seen a Stacy with a hooked nose.. I mean maybe they are prominent but therefore the shape is neither ugly nor long, just bigger than the average girl nose. Also never met a Stacy with witch skull. You can't be a Stacy if you have a witch skull. Maybe a high tier becky."
Trufemcels,feebfuc,t1_fee26c3,1579030308.0,"The taking photos part is so cruel and pathetic! 
I would take out my phone in high speed mode and take a photo of them, too. Make a camera duel out of it."
antiwork,fed3r60,t3_enw2m7,1578997333.0,"You are at rock bottom. Don't give up, look for a new job, make an appointment and find the right meds, do other stuff that is good for people's mental health. And don't you have someone to talk to? A friend? Reach out to someone. I know we depressed people tend to get desperate in situations like these really fast."
depression_help,fed3ebi,t1_fed2s8h,1578996813.0,"Yeah I also wonder maybe we are depressed bc we are just too traumatized, sensitive and feel that sth is wrong with this world."
depression_help,fed2oc7,t1_fed1loj,1578995741.0,"Aww man but don't you think they overreacted a little bit? So can you look for a new job?
Honestly, I have the same problem, have to go to a psychiatrist and psychologist but I have no job and therefore no health insurance. So it really sucks."
PinkpillFeminism,fed2jd2,t1_fecqrxf,1578995528.0,"If talking doesn't help, they have to face the consequences. How can they be so stupid and have zero self-respect."
PinkpillFeminism,fed2gbq,t3_eodod3,1578995402.0,OMG stahp! Women like her are the reason why men like that will never be extincted.

What's coming, girl?"
Trufemcels,fdp5570,t3_ek7743,1578620228.0,"Moids are so ridiculous.

Trufemcels,fdofwia,t3_elmvg1,1578604326.0,"You can text me! I have stopped watching anime for months but I started today again ""black butler"" because I miss watching Animes. But I think you are far ahead of me so I hope it is ok. I always wanted to have a femcel friend."
Trufemcels,fdkqjgv,t3_ellyae,1578509065.0,"I will turn 24 this month and I feel like this is a description of me ffs. First I thought I wouldn't care about what kind of youth I had and how much I suffered because I will die anyway but now I am so sad that I lost my youth to depression and not making any experiences. I also wonder what I did wrong, to deserve this and hope that I will die before I hit my 30s otherwise I will probably do it. There is nothing else to see for me here.

It is sad that you feel this way but always good that you are not alone. So, you are not alone. <3 
This sub makes me feel less lonely, I hope you feel the same."
