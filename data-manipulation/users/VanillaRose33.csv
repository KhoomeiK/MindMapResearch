Rabbits,ffcs25n,t3_esrjvk,1579806091.0,Mine bun preferred my bed 🤣 wouldn't touch hers unless it was next to the door to guard against cats taking her side of the bed.
Wiccan,ffckbes,t3_espn8a,1579801280.0,"So I have always been spiritual, and definitely though some people could preform magic. But I first learned about Wicca from a group of hippies that my ex brought me to buy from and smoke weed with. On of them explained to me the basis of the religion and it really interested me and made so much sense to me that I started studying."
funny,ffcji32,t1_ffbccmh,1579800788.0,He did warn her.
Wiccan,ffch1pb,t3_esn9s8,1579799294.0,"Ten years and I have never once gotten cake. What the fuck, I feel jipped."
Showerthoughts,ff9ldss,t3_es8lmh,1579715442.0,I have definitely used ice cream for sadness my entire life.
Dogtraining,ff9l40x,t1_ff949cd,1579715283.0,Honestly my dog cock blocks me when I'm ovulating. She ain't ready to be the big sister🤣🤣🤣🤣
oddlysatisfying,ff3e5wt,t3_er8mag,1579539263.0,Where can I buy these?

funny,fdhfbk3,t1_fdgstj6,1578421443.0,This makes me feel like a vanilla ass bitch. NGL
Teachers,fdgn4fp,t1_fdft5hd,1578402845.0,"I always said if it was so important to these administrators they would make a class specifically for socio-emotional wellbeing. I'm fine with raising my pre-K kids but when I'm tutoring high school students, it really isn't my job."
teaching,fde2h03,t3_ekprmo,1578329692.0,I have one now 🤣🤣 thankfully I started out the year with her unlike her brother who I acquired mid-year and was able to shape her into a well-behaved little girl. You wouldn't believe this sweetheart got kicked out of two previous schools before landing with me.
battlestations,fcxjc42,t1_fcx139e,1578064354.0,I feel attacked.
Makeup,fcws77x,t3_ej6ldc,1578035479.0,I take photos on an exhale

mentalillness,fcwrx7y,t3_ej57br,1578035172.0,"Take a hot shower and find something to keep your mind off of it. I used YouTube (probably to an excessive amount, don't do that) to keep my mind preoccupied. Just breathe for an hour and if after that you can't calm down call the hotline. They might not be able to do anything but sometimes just hearing someone else talk is enough."
Anxiety,fcwrmgg,t3_ej5m3j,1578034843.0,"I did the same thing a couple of months ago. My ex would routinely invalidated my PTSD episodes, tell me I was just ""playing the victim again"" or would give me the ""everyone has trauma, just suck it up"" line. It took 6 months of him completely ignoring me for me to leave and let me tell you, I am so much happier. It's terrifying at first and you'll doubt yourself every step of the way but in the end it is so worth it. You can do this and you will thank yourself in the long run, just stay strong and push through. I believe in you, stranger on the internet."
Rabbits,fcwr7gh,t3_ej4msm,1578034395.0,"The ""I want to relax but also binkies may be in order at some point"" flop."
Rabbits,fcwr55o,t1_fcvvl2c,1578034328.0,My bun only liked 3DS cables. Couldn't give two nuggets about any other cable. Some buns are just... Odd.

teaching,fcwqjvx,t3_ej5m06,1578033710.0,"I teach pre-K but right out of college I taught at a summer school program specifically for seniors who didn't graduate, for experience. I had one male student who would grab/slap/poke/oggle at my back side daily. I asked the director of the program multiple times to remove the student from my room but was told that I needed to ""stop wearing tight-fitting clothing, be more firm with the student and stop patroling the room"". I'm a 5'2"" 115lb woman, this student was twice my size and only 5 years younger than me. There was absolutely no way I was going to be ""more firm"" with him and not ""patrolling"" the room would mean students who were actually trying to finish their course work wouldn't get the help they needed and deserved. I finished with the program that year and never went back. I don't know what happened to that student, all I know is he didn't end up graduating."
dogs,fcwpefs,t3_ej93p4,1578032546.0,"I am truly sorry for such a difficult situation but the fact that you have given this beautiful dog a loving and warm home filled with comfort and peanut butter will make a difference in her passing. All you really can do is keep cherishing every moment and remember that you have given her the best time of her life, in a way you have saved her and that is what she will hold on to until the end."
teaching,fcwoszd,t1_fcwoiuy,1578031951.0,Also most schools are defunding art programs especially in middle and high school. The chances of getting a job as an art teacher AND for higher grades is pretty slim at the moment depending on what area you are in.

facepalm,fcw76g3,t1_fcvu071,1578018710.0,Have you ever seen porn? Because I can name at least 10 pornhub videos that have this narrative.
Anxiety,fcw6utu,t3_ej29di,1578018502.0,I use to feel this way then I found a job in my field that I love and started managing my time and taking care of myself. It really doesn't feel like I've worked 45+ hours a week anymore and I still find time to leave the house and do the things I love with the people I love the most. It's all about balance and setting reasonable expectations. Maybe in another 15 years I won't feel the same but at least for now I know what keeps the balance.
MechanicAdvice,fcw6cs9,t1_fcv0cfo,1578018175.0,This is my third cruze and as much as I loved my previous cruzes this one makes me not want to buy another one. With this and the case of the mysterious coolant leak I just want another civic 🤣
college,fcw5p1i,t1_fcw2zlx,1578017751.0,"Most of my textbooks we're updated yearly. It was near impossible to find the right book used and if you did it was only a couple bucks less than new. I once tried to sell back a brand new textbook for a class I dropped because I found out later it was taken off as a requirement a week after I signed up.  They told me they already switched to a newer version, from fall 2016 to spring 2017 less than a month."
college,fcw52je,t3_ej3dps,1578017331.0,My SUNY school required it only for freshman and on campus residents (there was only one kitchen in each resident hall which were taken by culinary students 99% of the time). I would talk to someone in the student resource office and explain your situation. It isn't fair that you have to spend so much money on something you are unlikely to use in its entirety.
MechanicAdvice,fcvyupl,t1_fcvbrnu,1578013227.0,Good thing I have a full year before I have too get it inspected again. Thank you so much
MechanicAdvice,fcuw5rh,t1_fcuurcu,1577989756.0,"Gas cap is fine. I tested it out by replacing it with the one from my sisters car, still had the same problem."
college,fcuvro5,t3_eitwz9,1577989539.0,"I did the same thing as you commuting and knocking out those gen. Ed classes in community college. My best advice is plan everything. Get everything ready the night before, clothes, bag, set up your coffee/tea/water whatever you take. Make sure you know your schedule and where everything is, then take a hot shower put on a good show and relax. You'll be fine, you've done this before a million times. Set a bunch of alarms to when you need to wake up, when you need to get out of bed and when you need to get your ass out of the house don't be modest about it either 10 alarms just means you are 10 times more likely to get out on time. Also eat a good breakfast, bagels are a good one, they fill you up and are easy to make but premade breakfast sandwiches are always great to wake up too. When you finally get going with classes make sure you write everything down in a planner, set multiple due dates. Say you have a lab with corresponding paper have a date to be done with the planning, the lab, the outline, the draft, the final product and make time to do it. Finally try to make time for yourself, I know it seems impossible but even 15 minutes a day to watch a YouTube video and wash your face will help you manage the stress. It gets easier as you get into the flow of things I promise."
Teachers,fclzkat,t1_fcknhzz,1577760361.0,"""How will you be paying me for the time spent?"" Usually gets me out of these."
mentalillness,fclym8b,t3_eht7ww,1577759671.0,"It's a medical condition and the only treatment recognize by the medical community is being who you truly are. How you go about that whether hormone replacement therapy, surgery or just changing your pronouns is up to you. Stay strong, you are perfect no matter what."
teaching,fcly8vv,t3_ehqf67,1577759406.0,Not accurate. None of those children have snot smeared on their face or pink eye.
college,fclgxvu,t1_fcl5zbg,1577747538.0,"10k was the amount for my community college for 6 months. I'm not sure what a university or a SUNY college would have their cost would be. All I know is my cost of living in my studio apartment is 850 (rent, utilities, internet) or half the cost of one semester of dorm living. Even if you added in the price of commuting (provided your car isn't an absolute money pit) it would still be less. Dorm life is a scam IMHO."
college,fcklb61,t3_ehmapz,1577727813.0,If you can get 20k for one room instead of 10k for one room wouldn't you cram two teenaged strangers together and watch the chaos unfold?
AskFeminists,fckjkld,t1_fcki8fj,1577726735.0,As someone who use to sell photos in college it definitely is an empowering rush and I would definitely define it as a fetish for some (not all some people do it solely as a income). So you are definitely spot on with this.
Teachers,fckfal8,t3_ehfg8f,1577724037.0,"It's ingrained into every teachers mind, Sunday scaries are no laughing matter."
glasses,fchgg1g,t1_fcha7jk,1577650274.0,If your eyes we're use to operating at -0.5 when they should have been higher. It definitely can do it.
glasses,fcgwmwa,t3_eh8j2i,1577644761.0,It happened to me when I had a huge jump in prescription. I would wear them around the house and take breaks every hour until it went away.
college,fcgnw5j,t3_eh6ofs,1577642229.0,Most community colleges have a daycare on site that take gov assistance. I would start there and see if you can find a degree or certification program that fits your need.
Teachers,fc65hzn,t1_fc3xdfv,1577472732.0,"Soc. Serv. Law § 371(4-a)
‘Neglected child’ means a child younger than age 18 whose physical, mental, or emotional condition has been impaired or is in 
imminent danger of becoming impaired as a result of the failure of his or her parent or other person legally responsible for his or 
her care to exercise a minimum degree of care...by misusing a drug or drugs, or by misusing alcoholic beverages to the extent 
that he or she loses self-control of his or her actions, or by any other acts of a similarly serious nature requiring the aid of the court; 
provided, however, that where the respondent is voluntarily and regularly participating in a rehabilitative program, evidence that the 
respondent has repeatedly misused a drug or drugs or alcoholic beverages to the extent that he or she loses self-control of his or her 
actions shall not establish that the child is a neglected child in the absence of evidence establishing that the child’s physical, mental, 
or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired.

Consuming alcohol while a child is under your care is considered reasonable cause for neglect in New York because of the fact that it impairs the caregivers ability to provide basic care. 

I as a mandated reporter which since you are an educator should be well versed in what that entails am required by law to assess the situation and make a judgement call. Which when dealing with young children means speaking with the parent/guardian to get a better picture of the situation. In this case like many it was a case of daddy came home from a hard day at work and needed a quick fireball and coke. Not enough to cause concern. I have to do a bit of investigating because honestly some of the stories these kids whip up are wild but are just a simple instance of them not understanding the situation.

Finally, it is not a open case because of the fact that there was no grounds for concern, daddy isn't a belligerent drunk. Even if it was, there is nothing in my story that could possibly give away the identity of the people involved so there would be no legal issue."
Teachers,fc2vb6l,t1_fc1wk2m,1577375010.0,Exposing children to alcohol is a reason I am required by law to report a parent to CPS.
funny,fc1ng3o,t1_fc1f5s1,1577324033.0,But those were your choices. I started at 14 years old and smoked everyday until after college. I graduated high school 12th in my class with honors and then I graduated 1st in my class from my tech school. I was enducted into the honors society right before I went to college. During college I maintained a 3.6 or higher GPA while working full time and managing an adult relationship. I graduated three years later with honors because of my 3.8 average GPA and guess what I strutted my ass down that stage high as balls. Everyday I accomplish my tasks high or not so honestly it sounds like you were just raised with no respect for hard work and dedication.
Teachers,fc1e2l2,t1_fc1dj18,1577315989.0,🤣 Your daughter is such a badass! I love it!!!
Teachers,fc04et1,t1_fbzoi9k,1577278048.0,Or C. I had to have a conversation with dad about how it is innapropriste that a four year old has been close enough to alcohol to know what fireball is. It can be consided neglect if a parent is exposing their child to alcohol.
Teachers,fc04b0o,t1_fbzk1rq,1577277905.0,Because I had to have a conversation with dad about why his four year old knows what fireball smells like.
depression_memes,fbzevkl,t3_ef7xhl,1577244378.0,Okay... Valid.... But last year I wanted to kill myself and it still felt like Christmas so I'm pretty sure it is just the lack of snow.

college,fbzejok,t3_eezrmg,1577244067.0,Just send an email or visit him when the holidays are over. It really only takes a couple of clicks of the keyboard depending on the program to change a grade and I'm sure once you make him aware he will be more than happy to fix it. No need to stress enjoy the holidays and much needed non-dining hall food.
Teachers,fbzecdi,t1_fbze75w,1577243879.0,Having to explain adult things to children to save your job really isn't fun. Timmy was pretty adamant that it was fireball in my coffee and I can't lie it gave me a good scare.
buildapc,fbze0wd,t3_ef9w6j,1577243583.0,Hair drier and floss. Use the hair drier to heat it and the floss to break the seal. If that doesn't work rubbing alcohol on cotton balls but be careful not to use too much then use the floss to really get it in there.
Teachers,fbzdruu,t1_fbzdnpp,1577243346.0,It would make the day far more interesting!
Teachers,fbyvvd1,t3_ef3r1s,1577227738.0,CC the email to your admin and don't respond to her. Let them handle it and remove the child. Parents need to learn that if they want their child to get an education they need to respect the people giving them one.
