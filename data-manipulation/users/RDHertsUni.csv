rickygervais,feoaw52,t3_eq3x3k,1579297544.0,"I think the great thing about XFM is that they were working within the confines of radio. So the hilarity of them saying things that will get them into trouble and Karl having to wrangle them in and just casually chatting about what’s on their mind as opposed to them just meeting up with the expectations to fill an entire podcast.

As much as I like the podcasts too I think it becomes a bit contrived. The way they react to what Karl says and even the way Karl goes on, it’s like they’re playing up to their roles a bit more."
