I got a few for you.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mcdonalds-100-beef/

https://www.mcdonalds.com.mt/quality/

https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/our-food-philosophy/commitment-to-quality.html

And before you say ""They're full of shit!"". I'll have you know they can be sued out the ass by making blatant false claims. What, do you think they get their beef from retarded cows or something? McDonalds has never not used less than grade A beef (At least here in Canada, where I live)

The reason they can sell cheaper is something called bulk. You ever wonder why Costco and Walmart can sell so cheap? The bigger bulk purchases a company makes the overall less cost. Anyways, I'll wait for your sources proving they buy rancid shit beef."
nostalgia,felmbii,t1_felegg0,1579225595.0,"They use 100% real beef, I know this as fact having begrudgingly worked at McDonald's. People who don't like the company will make shit up like the pink slime thing and sadly ignorant people will just believe anything that any idiot tells them to believe.

Edit: Looked at your profile after and got a pretty good chuckle out of the irony you frequent conspiracy subs. Heh, pretty hilarious."
