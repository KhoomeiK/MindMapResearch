Then again, I’m mainly talking about ad revenue, affiliate marketing, and drop shipping as being passive income models that can work, if not to the same degree. 

That being said, I’d like for all of the “just download this app/ complete this survey/ perform this menial task for a few cents” posts to die and burn in hell.

getdisciplined,fe5nd2n,t3_ent3xx,1578871727.0,"How easy do you make it for yourself to receive stimuli from the devices that encourage you to be passive? 

For example, do you sleep with your phone by the bed and check it first thing in the morning? One thing I've found is that if I use my phone for my alarm clock, when I wake up in the morning and turn off my alarm, it's second nature to then stay in bed, click over to Reddit, then Twitter, then YouTube. Suddenly, I have YouTube videos on in the background ALL DAY, even while I'm working. It's incredibly distracting and kills my productivity. 

When I noticed this trend, I asked myself what would happen if I didn't start my day by checking my phone. I went to Goodwill and bought a second-hand alarm clock and put it in my room on the opposite side of the room from my bed. I then took my cell phone and put it on the charger at the farthest point in my house from my room. Now, when my alarm goes off, I have to get out of bed to turn it off and I can't just stay in bed in check my phone. By removing that starting point, it's so much easier to just not go to YouTube and listen to videos all day while I'm working. 

Once I got in a habit of not checking my phone first thing in the morning, I decided to build another good habit into my morning. If starting by watching YouTube set me on a non-productive path, I figured that starting by journaling could do the opposite. So that's what I incorporated. I now get up, brush my teeth, hydrate, and journal all before taking a shower and getting dressed for work. Doing so puts me in a productive mind space and prepares me to be active and focused for the rest of the day."

Hit your core metrics, prove that you're a valuable team player, and then move into a new role. 

I felt like such a failure when I went into the career field that I thought I wanted to go into and hated. When I got my foot in the door in an entry-level role with a company I love, however, things changed. I still hated the job I was doing, but I only did it for one year.

selfimprovement,fdib3rc,t3_elioch,1578439012.0,"Are you familiar with the concept of ""fight or flight""? Some psychologists argue that the duality is a little oversimplified. There's also a freeze response. If you've ever heard of or seen someone completely freeze when they're scared or something bad happens, that's an example. I think sleeping could be a similar response. Your body's response to stress is to just freeze– go dormant, so to speak. 

I bet you could counteract that by prompting yourself to go for a short walk or got in another form of exercise when you start to feel like you're going into a snoozy shutdown. The book *Spark* by Dr. John Ratey outlines this really really well in the section of the book about stress."

marketing,fcgkz9j,t3_eh8lo2,1577641287.0,"Do you have a written marketing plan? 

Start by identifying your unique value proposition– what about you stands out from the others who are working on similar projects? How are you unique? What value does your uniqueness lend to your target audience?

On that note, do you have a clear target audience? If you write for everybody, you write for nobody. To build an audience, you need to be writing for a very specific customer persona and focusing on creating content that is going to resonate with that person. Be sure you know your audience persona inside and out. What is their demographic information (age, gender, location)? What hobbies do they have? How do they tend to vote politically? What questions are they asking? 

With your unique value statement and a customer persona, then you need to start looking at your content. Are you creating content that is meant to present a certain picture of you, or are you creating authentic and sincere content that brings value to your target persona? People want to read authentic writing– something that resonates with their own experiences. 

If you're creating high-quality content that's catered to your persona and underscores your unique value, you're about 50% there. Once it's created, how are your readers going to find it? Are you just publishing on a personal blog and hoping someone stumbles upon it? Or, are you leveraging SEO strategy and submitting guest posts with backlinks to your site to other publications? Are you using social media to build up a community of folks who are interested in your work? Are you building an email list and encouraging subscribers to share your work with their friends without being spammy? 

Finally, I totally don't say this to be rude or critical, but I do think it's significant that you asked the question ""Is it because of my personality?"". To me, this is a sign that you are doubting yourself– perhaps its imposter syndrome or old fashioned insecurity. But, if you don't believe in yourself, there's a chance that is going to shine through in your content and may deter readers. If you're writing online, you need to accept that you're committed to the long game. My first *year* of blogging regularly, I didn't have a single month where I crossed a cumulative 1k views. My the end of year two, I average about 5k monthly views and am trending upward. It takes time to build your brand, learn what channels work for promoting your work, and gaining the experience and authority to really make your writing shine."
AskReddit,fcghlkd,t3_eh8ibv,1577640128.0,"For sure. It's just me and my dogs, so there's nobody to be offended/ traumatized by seeing me naked. I just enjoy not wearing clothes."
Blogging,fcgee54,t3_eh7odk,1577639135.0,"This is a really interesting position to be in, and trust me it IS incredibly difficult to navigate the workload of building both of those brands. I'm speaking from a position of empathy here: By passion, I'm also a fantasy writer who is working toward being a published fantasy author one day. By platform, I'm a self-improvement and wellness blogger.

I've spent about the last two years trying to figure out the same issue that you're describing. Here's what I've figured out so far, and hopefully it helps give you a leg up!

1. First, it's important to keep in mind that when it comes to publishing genre fiction, having a platform is helpful but not 100% necessary. A lot of fiction authors build their platform with their work since genre fiction is one of the markets where editors tend to look for projects that are incredibly well written and have high market potential; the writing can stand on its own feet most of the time.
2. Second, if you're potentially interested in pursuing publication in a nonfiction field, that's where platform becomes incredibly important. Because nonfiction typically is meant to educate, inspire, or advise others, the quality of the writing is often secondary to the legitimacy and authority of the author. That's why so many gurus, big names, scholars, and CEOs tend to dominate the nonfiction world. They have the platform needed to both sell books and clearly identify them as an authority whose work deserves to be read.
3. I agree with r/MinnsThings that if you bundle both brands into one profile, it may be difficult to clearly connect with an audience for either. For example, someone looking for inspiration on their fitness journey may go to your website, see a post about fantasy writing, decide they're in the wrong place, and bounce. Conversely, someone interested in fantasy may do the same thing but upon seeing a fitness article. In general, if you're writing for two separate target personas, it's best to keep them separate. The exception to that rule would be if you have a target audience and content that blurs the lines– in this case, I think of something like Nerd Fitness, where it's not uncommon to see things like DnD campaigns turned into workout programs. They have an audience that is both fully nerdy and fully invested in fitness. If you can do something similar, that's an opportunity to create a niche that's simultaneously nerdy and sporty. Speaking as a marketer, it'd just be important to create a value proposition that distinguishes you from a platform like Nerd Fitness.
4. I also like r/MinnsThings idea of having a Twitter account for writing and an Instagram account for Fitness. The writing community is super active on Twitter and Instagram, being a visual platform, is great for things like workout routines, progress pics, nutrition advice, etc. On top of that though, I would advise holding the namespace for both of your brands across each platform. For example, I have the Twitter handle blakewritesblog, but don't actively post to it. Instead, I just use an integration to automatically share articles there as they get published. It has virtually no followers at this point, BUT as my brand grows on other platforms and as I look to invest in growing in different directions, I at least know that I won't have to fight with someone or pay someone to get that username.
5. Not a piece of advice, but like... can we chat some time? It seems like we've got super similar interests and I'd love to hear about your work/ I have no IRL friends that are as interested in both fantasy and fitness as I am."
marketing,fc6n5i9,t3_egcab8,1577484541.0,"I was in a very similar situation! I studied English at uni and was working in higher education for a while, but realized that higher ed administration wasn't a great fit for me. I had been doing some freelance writing and really enjoyed doing content strategy work with the couple of clients that I had at the time. After leaving higher education, I took an entry-level role that had nothing to with marketing at a marketing software company. 

In that role, I busted my ass to prove my competence and build up a reputation which then allowed me to take on projects outside of my core role. I scheduled coffee meetings and chats with folks in marketing and got to chat with them about their work. I also connected with our marketing blog's (about 5 million monthly readers) editor-in-chief and took on a few article assignments (which was still outside of my core role and in a completely different department). 

Over time, I was able to prove my skills as a marketer through the projects I was working on and value that I offered those in the marketing department. Now, I can sit at the table in marketing discussions and feel that my opinion is valued and my voice is heard just as well as those at the table who have more degrees than a thermometer in the field– regardless of our backgrounds, we have similar hands-on experience at this point."
