books,ffiwsff,t1_ffimyqi,1579984610.0,"In Sweden most public libraries use a Swedish system, SAB. But the university libraries have gone over to the dark side, Dewey, and the public libraries are following suite. 


I don't know Dewey enough to be able to compare it to SAB, but I think the former is rather clumsy for fiction. The codes are longer in Dewey, too, and Swedish topics are of course very low in the hierarchy. So instead of finding books on the Swedish language in Fc, we'll find them in 439.7. The Sami people are Mcs, in DDC 305.89455."

I think Hopkins' waltz would be good as background music in a romantic restaurant, but it has no interesting features that would make me stop and really listen."
mildlyinteresting,fffy1dw,t1_fffr31v,1579894288.0,"If you stand with your feet a bit more apart you look more self-confident and sort of stronger. Feet together you look like a doll. Little girls pick this up rather quickly, it's part of how females are ""supposed"" to be.

Most women naturally will have fat deposits on their inner thighs, which makes the feet together-position an act of strength and willpower."

MapPorn,ferx2x9,t1_fermysz,1579359232.0,"And in Sweden the word ""örlog"" is still used in some words pertaining to war at sea: örlogsfartyg = war-ship, örlogsflagga = war flag. The Germanic Wortschatze is pretty die-hard."

I think it's probably really difficult for a foreigner to know what towns to mark, since it's not only population that makes a town important. Think of Rovaniemi!"

dataisbeautiful,fdy4ixs,t1_fdy2cm5,1578776062.0,"Economic inequality has grown in Sweden since the 90's. The politics of most parties unfortunately seem to be from Matt 13:12 - Whoever has will be given more... Less taxes on real estate, bank savings etc. And less money for the unemployed, those too ill to work etc. There's also more tax reductions for those who have higher wages and for those who own their homes."

tifu,fdnt5c1,t1_fdn6w8t,1578592314.0,"American schools seem very limiting and single-minded when you hear these kinds of stories. 


In Sweden the teacher would probably ask the kid if he/she understands what they're singing and maybe engage the whole class in discussing the lyrics and which effects they might have on someone. The teacher might mention it to the parents, as a sidenote.


(If a kid repeatedly talks about dark things the teacher will take actions, of course. And kids are not allowed to scare other kids, so a murder rabbit would probably not be ok)"
tifu,fdg1gtf,t1_fdeibu4,1578376551.0,"Actually, I'm less confused now. And somewhat jealous! (Being monocultural and monolingual from birth is dangerous and will easily make you simplistic. Luckily I studied several languages through the years and now I live in a multicultural area)"

Lucky you, though, to be trilingual! I hope you'll get around tolearn German as well one day and then you'll be close to polyglot!"
MapPorn,fdebhfn,t1_fde31yx,1578335385.0,Partly because Sweden is not in NATO. All those countries were against Palestina as mentioned by another Redditor in this thread.

I don't know these languages, but if they say bures it's probably with some slight difference in pronounciation like buöres or maybe buõres. Skolt and Inari look weird (to someone who knows a little Northern Sami)."
aww,fcryxiy,t1_fcrfxey,1577908626.0,"In my area in Sweden you’re allowed to bring animals on the bus. The animals are supposed to be in the back of the bus, and allergic people have seats in the front. This is definitely not good for allergic people like me, but I haven’t heard much complaining. And I get just as sill from people with riding clothes on in the bus as from cats/dogs themselves. Asthma medicine is always in my bag...


Most people that bring dogs keep them on the floor if possible, or bring a sheet/towel for the animal to sit on, I’d  say 95%. It’s mainly young people who sit up front or do not use a blanket, and they usually apologize and move further back if someone tells them."

It's still difficult to understand the distances since the contiguous US is almost 20 times the size of my country, Sweden."

BeAmazed,fciddjn,t1_fci7ccq,1577660874.0,"From an environmental point of view this is not very good. The waves caused by the bridge may cause erosion and may also change the plant and animal life in the zone between water and land (depending on the area, of course).


The thought of a car going overboard and spilling oil etc isn't nice, either, but probably a smaller problem."

WTF,fcdomtj,t1_fcdh7ai,1577612023.0,"In Sweden they are probably the same as in the UK. There are strict limitations to what conditions they are allowed to treat. I think one reason they work for some people is sort of placebo, though, since they take their time and have a more human attitude than medical drs and physiotherapists.  


I actually went to see one because I had a severe torticollis (after doing my first somersault in twenty years, forgot to bend my neck, heard a crack, couldn’t move my head). I got rid of the torticollis immediately.


I know this was a condition that I could have fixed myself if I vould just get myself to turn my head enough, but I couldn’t. My body screamed noooo! when head turned just a few degrees to that side, and none of my friends would help me. So I basically just needed someone to grab my head and turn it, which this chiropractor did. 


TL;DR I think chiropractics can do a limited range of things right."
