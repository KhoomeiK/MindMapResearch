funny,ffec1n5,t1_ffdw931,1579842657.0,My ex cheated and left me 3 weeks after our son was born. He worked with her. His work had a baby shower for him. They are both colossal pieces of shit. I would totally have made this sign too if she didn't live in NYC.
Futurology,ffc1kmg,t1_ffbx8xu,1579789212.0,"Unfortunately, politicians say what the people want to hear during the campaign and do whatever the fuck they want while in office. My boss was volunteering with the Republican committee in his local town and I heard him on the phone saying exactly that - ""just say whatever it takes to get elected and then you can do all that other stuff"". 

I don't know what magical creature you think you are going to vote for, but i can guarantee that they are all going to say they have a plan to protect the environment. Figuring out which candidate is not completely full of shit is the real challenge."

AskReddit,fd0drxi,t1_fczsmrh,1578117383.0,I told my grandparents that it's an insult for me to call them family. You get stuck with family; you don't get to choose your family. I told them they were my friends and I would still be friends with them even if we weren't related.

depression,fcuspdo,t1_fcnd3s6,1577987748.0,"FWIW,  I didn't report you. I simply replied. I'm sure you have good intentions, but angry posts full of f bombs are not the way to get your point across. I can't stand seeing comments where people jump in and rip apart other people just because they can. It's supposed to be a conversation, not a fist fight. I appreciate your view on the subject, not your tone. Happy new year."

depression,fckv1x9,t1_fck0v8g,1577733807.0,"People also have the right to vent and not be judged. They even have the right to accept that sometimes there is no help. Even if OP was asking for help, what are you going to do? Post suicide prevention hotline numbers and links to support groups? Say shit like ""you are not alone"", ""stay strong"", and ""it gets better"". The worst thing you can do is angrily invalidate someone's raw feelings especially on this sub. Glad to see you cleansed yourself of that warm holiday spirit so quickly. It must have been giving you a rash."
