Assistance,fffcadc,t3_esd8vd,1579880803.0,"My mother suddenly passed away when I was 18.  We were all on separate vacations.  My older brother was away with his new bride, my older sister had gone on a retreat and I was going out for a 2 week backpacking trip in the desert.  My parents were taking my 8 year old brother and 7 year old nephew to visit family in Norway that my mother had connected to.

Everyone had left and my parents were the last to start their trip and as they were leaving the house, my mother collapsed, having complained about dizziness earlier in the day.  She had a sudden stroke due to a predisposition for clotting and a very rare heart defect that allowed clots to move more freely.  She was a ticking time bomb that no one knew anything about.  

I was pulled off the trail, everyone came home and she passed away a couple days later.  It was devastating.  None of us handled it well and it almost destroyed my family. Now, almost 16 years later, we have picked up the pieces of our lives but it still hurts to this day.  I just got married last month and it kills me to know my wife and any future kids I may have will never know my mother.  She was a great and caring woman.  

My advice is this: always remember her fondly and honor her memory by being the best you can be.  You aren't alone, no matter how lonely you will inevitably feel.  I wish you the best of luck and feel free to reach out to me anytime if you would like.  I'll be making a donation on your page."

YouShouldKnow,fdljsut,t3_em0dp2,1578525616.0,"My wife and I play Clue on the SNES all the time on the hardest difficulty.  If anyone played it, you'd know the slow trickle of info that you get and it's unlike playing the actual board game.  

We made little whiteboards up to mark down clues as we go.  We use permanent markers for the grid and dry erase markers for checkmarks etc. so we can wipe them off and play again.   

Long story short: Every week, we have to redo them since the dry erase markers take off the permanent marker if we run into the grid boxes.  I doubt anyone cares, but here I am anyway telling my little story and how this is relevant to me.

Edit: weâ€™ll look into tape for the grids lol I donâ€™t know why we didnâ€™t do that in the first place now"

You get an absurd amount of whatever you're ordering so the prices might seem higher, but you get something 2-3x the size you were expecting.  I've got enough triscuts to get us through a nuclear winter and I only ordered once."
CreditCards,fdi56ys,t1_fdhwhb9,1578435930.0,I use mine on Boxed.  I don't understand how it isn't more popular.  I get a load of pantry goods for cheap prices and get an extra 10 bucks off a month.
AmItheAsshole,fdi0ys6,t3_eliacz,1578433794.0,"YTA He was comforting you and you insulted his family and then talked about cheating on him.  I got Deja Vu typing that for some reason...  

BTW his family is your family when you get married.  You didn't have them as a family growing up, but they are your family regardless.  You can come up with as many extreme examples to make yourself feel better, but it is what it is.  I guarantee if he cheated on you, they would side with you and be angry at him.  I've seen it happen before.  

Don't actively try to push the good things in your life away just because you're used to bad things in life, but hey, that's just some random guy from the internet's advice"
amex,fdhixjv,t1_fdhi8a2,1578423619.0,"I believe AMEX actually does have an internally defined value for their points if I'm not mistaken.  It's .5 or .6cpp or something around there.  I remember stumbling into that information years ago, so it may have changed.  I believe it's tied to the value of redeeming them for a statement credit.  Don't quote me on that though, I'm going off of a foggy memory."
amex,fdhhz72,t3_elezha,1578423040.0,"Only referrals are taxable as they are income.  Think of it like a commission for finding new clients.

The point system is considered a rebate so it is not taxable.  

That being said, I know this info is easily found online so I kind of feel like this is a flex... but as they say: if you got it, flaunt it."
