AmItheAsshole,fefomao,t3_eoq0fz,1579060957.0,"YTA. You moved into a quiet residential area and don’t feel that you should contain your little snowflakes, thus everyone else suffers. 

The price of homes have nothing to do with being a nuisance and a disturbance. People are entitled to their peace. How inconsiderate and self involved."
aww,feca5fn,t3_eo6njp,1578969406.0,Dog looks stressed.

AmItheAsshole,fdssmks,t3_emrycx,1578707417.0,NTA. I’m severely allergic to milk. If someone who’s supposed to care about me prepared and expected me to consume  a product that would render me severely ill I’d leave. Not just for fast food (which should also be an allergen) but the relationship on a whole. Dead ass. That tells me everything I need to know.
WeWantPlates,fdsrd9j,t3_empwb2,1578706951.0,This is cute
AmItheAsshole,fdspgzo,t3_emr755,1578706255.0,NTA. Good for you showing strength and self-love!! Just don’t believe the slut part and you’ll be fine. Ignore stupid friends who are trying to weaken your boundaries.

AskWomenOver30,fd5uzq8,t3_ejxxa5,1578181832.0,"I’d like this. I’m very social when I’m social, but I’m a deep introvert who needs quite a bit of time for myself. I get claustrophobic easily and start to back away when people become too needy. 

A well-rounded man who can independently do his own thing is great. That’s not a measure of intimacy. Intimacy is about connection not codependency. There must be space between two individuals."
