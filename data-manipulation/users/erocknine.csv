All Kanji was originally Chinese, even hiragana was based off Chinese.

I'm sure the income for servers in smaller towns are going to be much worse, but in NYC at least, servers are not suffering. If they were, there are plenty of other retail jobs to work while aiming towards their actual career goals. Which is my other point, there are exponentially a lot more people going out to eat being negatively affected by tips than there are servers that would be negatively affected by lower tips.

So every cook should just demand the chef's job so the restaurant can have 5 chefs? Or demand a wage that equals $300 a day, which would require $30-40 an hour? Sure, an employer is going to willingly double his labor cost because someone was convincing. If negotiating a wage at a retail job was the solution, no one would be complaining about wage. I think I know when I see someone who knows nothing about the industry, or work in general. I don't think you know anything about how business works, at all.

Babies cry from the slightest thing because they've never felt anything like anything before. Any pain is the worst thing they've ever felt. Then you get to young teen to teen ages, dealing with issues they've never experienced before either, or realized even mattered before. I wouldn't immediately call them mental health issues, just like I wouldnt call a baby's incapability to deal with loud noises a mental health issue either. And if you start thinking you have a mental health issue, the less confident you are in your life, and the more dependent you are on other things like drugs and therapists in order to stay lively, which is a horrible thing to start your life with, and trust me, your life hasn't even started yet. You think people reminecse their preteen or teen ages? If everyone went to a doctor at a young age, half of everyone with creative capacity like artists or dancers would've been diagnosed with ADHD and given pills to shut them down.

The older you get, you just realize those issues you had at young teens weren't real issues at all compared to things you deal with as a grown-up. Try dealing with an existential crisis while trying to pay rent and groceries, cause that's pretty much the prime of everyone's lives at 20-35, and the top age is only getting higher."
