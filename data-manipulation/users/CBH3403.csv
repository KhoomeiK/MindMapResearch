Of all the people I think the FBI unfairly fucked with Hemingway, wasnt that unfair. He had tons of communist friends, was a major celebrity, and had a tendency to love a fight (dude fought in WW1, the Spanish Civil War, and broke the Geneva Conventions in WW2 when he literally lead a platoon of US troops into Paris to liberate his favorite bars). Jean Seberg didnt do anything, she was a French New Wave Actress who donated to the black panthers, Heminway was a literally a military trained writer, with a tendency to black the fuck out. I think the FBI has a duty to keep an eye on a person with that much power, who enjoys that good of a time.

firefly,ff73w2s,t1_ff722vt,1579640605.0,"I dont agree with you saying Serenity should be first, but I think Wheedon (thinking, correctly, that this was his magnum opus) could have done a lot more to preserve the show. From pitching it to another studio, he had a deal with Fox but they would have probably let him go to HBO or Showtime or more conducive studio (only for him to return after the show is over), to hiring more marketable actors (i.e. NPH tried out for the Doctor part, and honestly I think he would be perfect in the role), Wheedon had options. Most notably cutting back on the crazy ass production budget. Like why did they make the entire Serenity ship. Like I get that the ship is gorgeous and a great creation, but making one huge crazy set is much more expensive then 10 smaller sets. And finally, why didnt they use the Serenity budget for another season of the show. Universal liked the idea, because of the crazy Firefly DVD sales. I dont get why they didnt use that 30 million on a second season. Even if each episodes budget tops out at 2 million you would still have enough to make a complete second season. The movie seems like an extremely weird choice."

Reid and Smith, both very much risked everything while kneeling, and many former NFL players who joined them were just as brave. Kap risked nothing, actually it could be viewed as Public Relation stunt, instead of a protest because he lost his starting place to Blaine Fucking Gabert a literal week before. Yeah, people talk about Kap, like he was protesting during his Super Bowl loosing campaign, but he didnt. He only started protesting after he sucked for an entire year, needed three surgeries, and lost his starting spot  to a bum (meaning his contract was no longer applicable for a full pay out). Like I agree with his point, because it is true, I believe that he had the right to protest in that way, I just dont necessarily believe Kap had all the best intentions at heart. Now that being said, the way the league has black balled this kid is absurd, and I glad he sued to get his money because that is ridiculous."
flicks,ff6e0lt,t1_ff673em,1579625148.0,"Both are trying to accomplish different things, so I think the character gripe with the movie is pretty ridiculous. The movie is a hundred times better than the book, because it literally removes everything from the book, and gets to the bare bones of the story (the story of a father not wanting a family). Making it the perfect adaption. I mean the book is told from Jack's perspective, so of course he is a more positive character than the movies. In all honesty, great books are almost impossible to adapt to the screen. The Great Gatsby for example, could never work because it's such a inwardly tale. But, Kubrick does the impossibly by making Jack's breakdown visual. Honestly, Steven King's opinion is entirely mute because he made Maximum Overdrive.

firefly,ff65eds,t3_ep5cjr,1579619548.0,"I just finished the show, and it's the wide screen format. Honestly, I think Fox said ""Fuck this"" after that demand from Whedon. Which is honestly completely fair. 2003 isnt today, so you have to remember that most people had a normal television back then. Not flat screens, that can adapt aspect ratios, but boxy pieces of shit. So, immediately the aspect ratio would be completely off for the normal viewer (meaning those people watching Firefly live had characters out of screen or action that didnt fit into your TV's frame. Something you wouldn't notice streaming). This camera format was a major demand from Whedon (and aslo added millions to each episodes budget) who wanted to give the show a ""Searchers feel"", he even filmed the pilot incorrectly so that the studio was forced into airing the wide screen format. Which is honestly insane, when you realize the budget they gave him. Like Firefly is a nightmare story of studio intervention, but they still gave Joss a giant pilot budget. A budget most showrunners on major american channels will never see, even if they are super successful. Whedon claims he did everything he could for the series, but this is where I start to doubt him because the series wasnt a guaranteed hit. Again this isnt today, when nerd culture, is the dominate pop culture. Firefly is an adult science fiction show, with super adult themes, in a world that is completely original. Even with today's pop culture, you couldnt make that shit (i.e. Game of Thrones was on the NYTimes best sellers list for a decade before HBO even thought about making a series, and even then that first season is a pretty normal HBO show). So, why screw with the people giving you unprecedented millions for an unprecedented TV show. I get vision, and artistic autonomy, but not when it costs millions of extra dollars and doesnt add anything huge to the story (actually it makes the story less easy to grasp for a major audience). I also bet, Fox was paranoid following the embarrassment of that Heat Vision and Jack which was the most expensive pilot to ever fail. I mean it's a show about Jack Black an astronaut who goes on adventures with his talking motorcycle Owen Wilson, so it's not the craziest thing to happen (Dan Harmon the guy who made Rick and Morty wrote it). But it was a huge story, and embarrassment for Fox at the time of Firefly's production. So even after giving Whedon unprecedented freedom and buget, he still spat in their face with a format not conducive to the consumer product. Leading to Fox, and Murdock to say fuck this. So, they produced the rest of the first season, so they didnt have the embarrassment of Heat Vision and Jack, and then aired the show on the worst time slot out of order, because literally a huge chunk of the population couldnt watch the show correctly. However, they got screwed because nerds buy box sets, and the show is actually genius. So, they look like a bunch of clowns, even thought they had the audience's best intentions at heart."

It stinks cause we didnt get a Breaking Bad esque character arc, but I also think this was closer to Joss' image of the character. For all the shit we give Fox, they wanted Mal to be funnier, and his sarcasm (that becomes evident in the rewritten pilot the train job thing), makes the character work way better.

clevelandcavs,fclarb5,t1_fckuxc9,1577743520.0,"Cause Lebron publicly supported a totalitarian dictatorship while creating an advertisement campaign designed to ask questions of power. The irony is so large, it literally will cloud the rest of Lebron's career. That's what happens when you support a government currently imprisoning and killing (to harvest organs) an ethnic minority within their country. Just ask Charles Lindbergh..."
clevelandcavs,fclabr8,t1_fcl171h,1577743245.0,"If you down vote ""FreeHongKong"" it means number one your against democracy (that's fine there are many political systems on planet earth, and we dont have to agree on them) however, number two it means your into totalitarian dictatorships. Another totalitarian dictatorship at least in history was the Nazis. So, using my own logic, if you down vote a FreeHongKong post you at least like the Nazis."

AskReddit,fcknjwa,t1_fcjiefz,1577729184.0,"Some of it is stupid in hindsight. Like why would they ever test LSD on army veterans? Well think about it from that era. This is a new drug that literally makes you see things, they didnt know if it could fuck with enemy combatants or not. So it was tested.  Also, the guy in charge of those test, would always be the first guinea pig. I mean the mother fucker literally gave himself Sarin which is bananaland crazy. Same thing with the remote controlled dogs, and shit like that. We need to test stupid ideas to find the smart ones, and by god the United States is just the bunch of nuts to do it."

Basically, when comets and asteroids hit our planet, get through our atmosphere, but dont hit the Earth surface they hang suspended in air forming these triangle shapes in the skies. These triangles travel with the wind and can be miles long. They are also known to make human's trip balls and the Russians/Chinese have been experimenting on them for decades. All time weird shit.

PremierLeague,fck3vf3,t1_fcjrhga,1577715812.0,"I have never seen replays institutionalized this poorly. I thought people were crazy when they said the refs are purposefully fucking around so we go back to the old way, but yesterday that seemed half true. I mean it's astounding. Number 1, why the fuck does the premier league have so few cameras? As an American, it feels sinful. But, seriously the MLS has a better replay system and more cameras than the most popular league in the world.  Something I find mental. Like watch the NFL, they have mother fucking pylon cameras, but the premier league cant follow a back line.  Second, why are there individual VAR refs, this seems like the stupidest idea I have ever seen. Like no other fucking sport does that they all have replay centers. But, naw the premier league would rather let egomaniacal bastards fuck around with my Saturday. I mean I want VAR, it is absurd to say otherwise. We have the technology and we should implement it accordingly. But some of this shit is absurd."

P.S. that virgin “fact” is based on one guys quote and the fact that newton was super secretive. Nothing else. Your literally saying hey, I would rather not be the smartest man ever because I want to bang a few bitches. And I love bitches I’m just saying your logic is moronic and I find your opinion mute."
unpopularopinion,fc6cjgl,t3_egcaxa,1577477379.0,"Why the fuck is lacking masculinity a problem? What the fuck does that even mean? I mean fucking Sir Isaac Newton wasnt very traditionally masculine (dude grew up with a single mother) but he is one of the greatest men in history. Who the fuck cares if you are masculine or you understand manhood. There is nothing to understand. Life in general is complicated, and lacking a father figure definitely sucks. I would agree with you that it can have a negative effect (i.e. substance abuse, and arrest records) but you are going about it the wrong way. Manhood is different for everyone. It's different for me, and for my father, and we are closer than two peas in a pod. Your attacking a personality trait, and a societal problem as if they are the same thing. Masculinity however you define it, has nothing to do with father figures. Having a adult male figure definitely helps people become reasonable adults, but the cultural evaluation of our sexuality, has nothing to do with our father or how they raise us."
clevelandcavs,fc6amgb,t1_fc5rspm,1577476117.0,"Dude I am not a fan of anime, I am just not a fan of people shitting on other's fandom (also, the fact that you've never heard of either Cowboy Bebop or Spirited Away just shows me that you literally live under a fucking rock. I mean holy shit, one of those is a top 5 movie of the 21 Century, at least according to the fucking New York Times). This person literally made a Cavaliers image geared to their own interests, but you cant handle that. I mean it's about the Cavaliers, and about basketball because these characters are fucking playing basketball in Cavaliers jerseys so why does this not deserve to be on this sub. Just because this fans idea of fandom doesnt align with your version, doesnt make it wrong. However, it does make you an assclown of the highest order. 

Also, to quote Marshall Mcluhan, look him up, I know you are way to fucking dumb to know who he was, who was quoted by Andy Warhol (I hope you know who that is, but I still doubt it. He's the Soup guy, you fucking imbecile) ""art is anything you can get away with."" So, Family Guy is art, basically anything people are willing to share for other's enjoyment. So, in tern this weird Anime picture is art of the highest order and should be celebrated not mocked."

(Also Scotty from Star Trek literally landed on the beeches of Normandy and Ernest Hemingway helped liberate France. He was a writer but, all the soldiers loved him cause he would hook everyone up using his celebrity). However, fuck John Wayne. Wayne literally helped create this machismo masculinity but refused to serve because he had flat feet. Honestly, there is a ton of teenage boys at Arlington with flat feet, so that isnt an excuse. Especially when you realize that Wayne, would literally destroy Veterans careers in the Red Scare. Dude was the definition of a piece of shit war monger."

If you tell this person to stop or are rude to this person you have the maturity of a middle schooler. They are creating art about something we collectively enjoy, and are posting it on our communities forum. If you are a middle schooler, there is no need to be dismissive or rude to someone just because they are different. The oddities of life are consistently the best part. Finally you two behind the screen douches telling this person to stop, your inability to appreciate this persons creativity and effort makes you look fucking stupid. Like so fucking stupid. I mean what are you fucking ten? Jesus, people can be fans different ways, but there is no need to mock them for being a fan in a different way than you. God, did you guys have an accident or something, because that's the only reasonable explanation for your unabashed stupidity."

clevelandcavs,fbylyhn,t1_fbws4zl,1577220286.0,It’s the picks not Exum. Exum and Clarkson are the same level of player just opposites. I would argue Clarkson has massively out shined Exum due to draft position but beyond that they have no differentiation (beyond one scores and the other plays D). We want 2s nothing else. We are tanking hard but Atlanta still has our pick (protected) this is assurances and maybe we are looking for a trade for Kevin that needs 2s. The players add nothing to the table.
