Again, the rationale is that bank is controlling operational risk, ie you as a fraudster writing bad checks.  I saw the graphs of credit score plotted against profit for a given account and was surprised how as credit score got worse, profit got WAY better.  So it’s conceivable they’ve loosened further the credit score requirement or got rid of it to make money.  Even after fraud losses those accounts were still very profitable.  This is ~2006 or so."

Payments in Germany meant going into the Bundespost and handing over cash to pay your phone bill vs. mailing a check.  Or you could do an ACH payment.  But no paper.  You had Deutsche Telekom phone cards that could be loaded with money.  This is 20 YEARS at least before the US had such things commonly used."

I wonder if BBVA messed up on the reporting.  If no one is there to grouse about a process that didn’t happen correctly no one is there to alert the bank.  You might have gotten lucky.

technology,ffi053p,t1_ffhz4bk,1579960978.0,"You’re correct.  Cheksystems is the database where banks share information among themselves.  Like casinos who share information on cheaters - there is a mutual interest in avoiding fraud so such a process makes total sense.

Yes and banks are definitely willing to do what they can to say yes.  After all poor credit people are also the most profitable.  And if you’re a Wells customer your bank said yes for you :). 

That’s what’s disturbing about that 25% figure.  I’m skeptical."

technology,ffhx7is,t3_etolrr,1579957866.0,"Poor credit people don’t qualify for a demand deposit (checking) account because of the risk of fraud.  If their name is on the Cheksystems list (wrote a bad check) you also won’t get approved.

This seems outdated if the debit card does a real time balance check before transacting.  So I would imagine banks could start to offer this, except that they don’t make money on this kind of account if there are no fees incurred.

The real headline is buried: 25% of people in the city can’t even get a checking account?  Holy shit.  That’s the real problem.  Let’s dig into that one.  No way 25% of a city’s population is a bad credit risk right?"
