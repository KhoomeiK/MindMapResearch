gtaonline,ffq6sr2,t1_ffq3gbu,1580123568.0,"Yeah, there certainly is incentive to make the game less fun and more grindy than it could be and in a lot of aspects they have taken the absolute piss with that. Also they put a lot of content behind paywalls, but by the point the daily costs amount to something noticeable people will likely also have multiple sources of passive income, which still have the costs beat and require not much attention.

Sure I've lost a few millions to these daily costs by now but I don't really see people struggling to pay rent in game. R\* could have taken this way further if they wanted, especially with expensive properties like the penthouse or the doomsday facility.

The existence of shark cards makes me question a lot of design aspects in GTAO, but I see R\* more trying to push it with properties (again content gating behind paywalls) and car prices (then again they never went back and adjusted old car prices, which still leaves some quality budget vehicles, just imagine what the armored Kuruma would cost if released today).

I see shark cards more as an option for people who want something instantly than a means to pay daily fees."

gtaonline,ffq0ot3,t1_ffpxtm7,1580114026.0,"Them defaulting to auto aim when testing would explain a few things, also GTA always releases on consoles first, so that could explain why they'd focus on auto aim more than good free aim (though I personally play with controller on PC using free aim; not the best system, certainly not helping my shooting performance, but I hate aim assist in this game).

I don't really use public lobbies at all. The bad experience there starts with the loading times. Can't imagine still playing this game if we really were forced to sell in big lobbies, as it is clearly intended."
gtaonline,ffpx6ue,t1_ffpuoz8,1580109305.0,"Well if they go the direction RDR2 went this might all get even more inconvinient with the next game. They sacrifice so much fun for their immersion which immediately breaks when players step out of line.

I don't mind the daily costs that much as you will need to already have quite a few expensive properties before it really starts going, but the other things you mentioned sometimes really kill the fun for me. Especially paired with how clunky the characters handle due to the damn long animations. Can't stop and turn around because the animations need to play out.

Plus the whole thing about free roam businesses, they feel less like they are designed to be good revenue for and fun for players doing the missions and more to put some targets on griefers' radars."
gtaonline,ffpwuiq,t3_eui9gj,1580108878.0,"I think it's a necessary evil actually. It scales well as it only really starts to matter when you get to the expensive stuff. Having played an online game that doesn't have this kind of money sink - Sea of Thieves - I can tell it gets really boring if you can just buy out an entire dlc and just amass a ton of money with nothing to spend it on at all, to the point where the entire currency becomes useless.

Taxing the people who already have some of the most expensive items and about every building they can own *should theoretically* keep them from just getting silly amounts of money, which in return could mean that new items don't need to be that expensive as there's just not that group of super rich people whose wallets need some draining.

That being said the economy in this game is a mess, so it doesn't really work and in return R\* just keeps upping the ante with vehicle pricing."

gtaonline,ffpfwlr,t3_eues75,1580094049.0,"From R\*'s point of view it makes sense to just have one game that offers everything to some degree, it bolsters the playerbase and has them develop one game instead of many.

For players it can be a blessing or a curse. Advantage is that it's not just a racing game, you can make money in a lot of ways and have more activities in general, but if all you care for is racing then the map could be better and more geared towards that and you will have a bad time making money because racing, unless you are consistently winning, doesn't pay that well.

Personally I'd like to have just a racing game with slightly less arcady physics (and without all the unintended boosts this one gives) and a world more geared towards being raced. I'd still play GTA, but for other reasons."

Seaofthieves,ffk1n1z,t3_etyyaf,1580013057.0,"It sounds like a good game for casual gaming due to all progress and unlocks being cosmetic, but with the complexity of the ship controls, the (sometimes not completely intended) advanced battle mechanics and a decent amount of experienced players just being out for blood it just isn't.

I had a lot of these sessions during my time playing SoT, usually when playing solo as my friends weren't available, so I feel your pain. With all the random encounters and chance to run into other players you never know what you get yourself into, but I have to question if this inconsistency really is a good thing. And for me at this point it's more the case that I want to play with my friends, but not this game. Though that's also down to me getting bored from the ever same activities.

The rare ones cost more and your assistant will tell you about them when you get the chance to buy one.

\-A local businessman rigged his WiFi to send messages to any of his contacts, should they come within a block from his business. Locals threaten to sue or relocate.

\-Serial robberies intensify in Chumash' Fleeca bank location as there aren't just around a hundred robberies every day but now in addition to that more aggressive and highly armed parties coming in to rob the gear of the robbers themselves. They are taking no prisoners nor any bank inventory, but they will take the power drills.

\-As inflation hit Los Santos hard 99.9% of the population is still driving models from six years ago and older. Citizens are outraged that the latest Asbo compact car from Maxwell costs more than not one but two high end sports cars from 2013.

\- The Fort Zancudo military base reports a new record for LAZER-jets stolen from them. Most culprits are confirmed to be owners of hangars on said base, still the military did not revoke any entry rights or ownerships for unknown reasons."

gtaonline,fe5u2cr,t3_enrif7,1578874947.0,Would be cool especially since that'd add incentive to play with more people.
gtaonline,fdz6arz,t1_fdyh04f,1578787113.0,"Just tested that and it works! Thank you very much, this was seriously getting annoying"
gtaonline,fdvbveg,t3_en5n19,1578745827.0,"He sends you a message whenever you get close to his business. Madrazo does the same, but thankfully his ranch isn't in the center of the damn city. I have a nightclub near simeon, I really should just bite the bullet and relocate."
cats,fdoecdt,t3_em9s6d,1578603548.0,Very talkative today.
gtaonline,fdkmpzc,t3_elo8lc,1578506767.0,You can also get one of the base game sports cars for less than the Asbo.
gtaonline,fdd4fhk,t3_ekgrya,1578294351.0,"I played a ton of GTA Online but San Andreas still has it beaten in my eyes. SA is where the series peaked in terms of it being a do-what-you-want sandbox, also having multiple cities is great, V has a lot of underutilized areas on the map. And after SA R\* has become more and more restrictive with their mission design."
Minecraft,fdd420u,t3_ekgc0z,1578293903.0,"I always played with faithful 32 as I found the default textures to be really ugly. Thought it was just down to the low res, but since the rework I'm quite happy with the default textures (though I didn't like some of the stuff at first but it all comes together nicely).

Though part of me still wishes Mojang would have upgraded to 32 based textures in the same vein. This looks great, might switch to it once it's done."
gtaonline,fdd2kyg,t3_ekim4p,1578292246.0,"Yeah, a few tries went down the drain because someone got in the way of this guy. Guess with all the times the casino has been robbed and security got wiped out it must be difficult to find good people that pass mental checks."
gtaonline,fdcye69,t3_eklki1,1578288003.0,I always restart and go invite only after. The game is pretty much unplayable if you default to public sessions (like R\* highly incentivises you).
gtaonline,fd8y5ba,t3_ekavr2,1578225226.0,"Would love o see this in game, but can't imagine getting far in game before the Havok would fall off."
Minecraft,fczvicc,t3_ejmd4p,1578109320.0,"I usually plan in my testing world in creative, but at some point I got tired of then just rebuilding everything on my survival server. I plan out what I need to  but don't like prebuilding everything anymore."
GTA,fczuv2z,t3_ejk73z,1578109007.0,"What does he even complain about? Like there is nothing of substance, no actual claim of bad working conditions or anything like that. Just seems like a guy who agreed to do a job for R\* and now feels in hind sight that he wasn't paid enough because the game and the company got bigger than anybody could have thought. He likely got a contract describing the amount of work they asked from him and what he'd get for it and it was good enough for him to sign it. End of story, unless there were some bad working conditions, crunch or the likes.

And especially considering how big the game was with all content in it, his voice acting (while surely not bad) doesn't make 10% of it."
gtaonline,fctfloz,t3_eiljnq,1577941697.0,"Agree. When it comes to movement there always are a few tings really weird with R\* titles.

Apart from being forced to walk slowly there's a weird discrepancy between third and first person, like in the casino heist you can absolutely zoom through the finale with first person *sneaking*.

The character animations just take too long, especially annyoing when trying to move precisely and trying to stand still at a point or transitioning animations. Sometimes this makes you feel drunk when trying to go through a door frame. Or you are stuck in an idle animation at your laptop for a while.

And then there is the whole thing about having to tap a button in order to run or ride a bike quickly. I get that it allows for multiple different running speeds, but as a player its so much more convinient to press a button once and get into sprint mode."
gtaonline,fcilzy0,t3_eh8ncs,1577664803.0,I'd take artwork over gold. You can easily clear it out with two people and get more for it unless you have a third guy. And in that case you'll still likely get less with gold due to their cut.
