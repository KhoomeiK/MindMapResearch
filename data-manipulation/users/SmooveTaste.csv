Not all of his advice is bad, but there's no reason you can't have a sweet guitar and learn how to play it nicely. I get what he's saying about understanding rhythm: it's critically important. But buy a drumset or take dance lessons instead of buying a nice guitar? There's no reason you *have* to learn how to dance or play drums in order to understand rhythm.

For practicing rhythm or whole songs, I wouldn't use a metronome. Find some recorded backing tracks, loops, use a DAW drum synth or play along to other artists' recordings.

If you don't want or can't afford option 1, I'd go with option 2 based on my experience. I had an out-of-warranty XS Max I'd dropped and shattered the screen. Apple quoted $300+ to replace the screen assembly, which also includes the front camera, face ID sensor and speaker. So they did the repair and ran a self-test diagnostic. It failed the self-test, so they replaced it with a brand new phone, as is their policy. Sucks that I had to pay, but this was the best possible outcome: leaving with a brand new phone.

This song was written in the band’s early days and I’m not sure why they waited so long to put it on an album, but I’m glad they did because it really lights up this record. 

I wish they hadn’t put the best two songs on the album back-to-back at the end of it but I’m still happy they got them on an album before they split with Dave. 

Great fucking song to mark the end of an era for them."
