When I rode with her again I realized I was hearing the same songs in the same order, so I looked around and saw the case for one of the Twilight soundtracks.

todayilearned,fdzs4ys,t1_fdvgu92,1578794507.0,"In earlier use the ""middle"" of the middle class was in relation to owning the means of production/capital. They were professionals like lawyers and doctors who didn't fit into the category of either the working class or the ruling class.

As time has gone on (in some places) the ""middle"" has come to describe where they fall on the scale of income--between poor and rich. I imagine the expanding definition has to do with people coming to see the term ""working class"" as pejorative, and politicians etc. being happy to appease their aspirations by simply lowering the bar for use of the term rather than actually changing anything about their life."
