Denmark,ffi3ltg,t3_er080b,1579964103.0,"It feels like a loaded question, in many ways.

Firstly, we don't lose half our salary. We invest in our _population_.  There are stark differences in how America works and how Denmark works. In America, it's everybody for themselves. Here, we take care of each other.

We don't have to navigate a health insurance system. We don't have to worry about whether it's covered by our employer or whether we have to go out and get coverage by ourselves. We don't have to worry about whether a medicine we need is covered, because everybody has the same system. For medicine specifically, you basically pay the first ~150 hundred dollars on your own, and from there, the more you spend past that, the government covers a higher and higher percentage of your medicine cost. Here's a table, conveniently converted to USD amounts.

|0-147|147-244|244-530|530+|2872+|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0%|50%|75%|85%|100%|

Anyway, the cost for our health care is deducted from our salary automatically via taxes, and then everyone is covered. In the end, it's really the same system, it's just that our system is cheaper since there's less overhead, and there's no selfish ""I'm young and don't need it right now, so I don't want to pay"" behavior. The lack of this behavior lowers the cost for everybody, since the cost is distributed to the entire population. We also don't have to pay a cut to insurance companies. And of course, that's only a small percentage of our taxes, but the same could be said for a ton of things. The midwest is pretty notorious for having atrocious potholes, and while our roads aren't perfect, the images that I've seen on Reddit from time to time, have looked like pictures out of a 3rd world country, but nope, just Minnesota (for instance).

Another thing is that, it's never quite as simple as 40%. Everybody has deductibles, so unless you end up in the maximum tax bracket, you'll pay less tax than whatever your municipality's rate is. I currently only have the base deductibles since I don't have any loans or whatever, but I don't earn enough to reach into the maximum tax bracket, so I pay around 31,5% tax.

And our tax is progressive, which I believe the US tax system is too, but it still seems like a lot of people don't quite understand it. Whatever you earn _above the limit to the maximum tax bracket_ is taxed at that rate. Everything below will be taxed at the normal rate. So if the limit is, say, 100k and you earn 105k, you'll pay normal tax of the first 100k and the higher 52% tax (before deductibles) on the last 5k.

There are pros and cons to any system, but simply looking at it as if we are ""losing"" part of our salary is shortsighted and ignorant. That's like saying you lose part of your salary by having health insurance paid for by your employer. The reality is that you still gain value, since you will have health insurance, potentially even covering spouse/children.  
I much prefer our system, but I can see why the US system might be beneficial if you have plenty of money for premium health insurance and those kinds of things."
