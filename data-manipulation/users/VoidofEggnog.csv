pcmasterrace,fdrtwaq,t1_fdrokbf,1578689595.0,"Yea R6 is a little slower paced and so I prefer push to talk for games like that. Games like Rocket League are more fast paced and since I use a controller push to talk is annoying. I've gone a different route and I have push to mute set up. Anytime I'm talking to someone in my house, sneezing, coughing, taking a drink, etc., I'm using the push to mute so no one can hear me."

The difference is that we're recorded the entire time we're working from all the cameras people have. You dont have any room to be an idiot. However it's really not that hard. I've only ever received one complaint and it was because some guy thought I stole from him. And I dont even feel like I work that hard lol.

My fault with you was that you didn't say what the information was and compared it to my information which was different. Besides we'd live in an amazing world if people researched and read links and articles and didn't just read the comment and move on, but we don't live in that world. If you're going to share information you need to say what the information is. I don't know why you're pushing against that so hard."

If someone doesn't click on the link then they assume the info you provided is the same as mine which is false.

Also as for the murder comment I'm not sure what you're getting at. I never said murder wasn't against the law. Nor did I bring anything about murder at all aside from homicide by firearm statistics."

I specified I was looking at homicides because that's what matters. People kill themselves all the time and that's not the guns fault. Be it drugs or jumping off a building, people find a way if thats what they want. I'm not anti or pro gun, I was just trying to show the data that I got from the FBI.

civ,fccaitp,t3_egwsgw,1577596197.0,"Dams need to be placed on a river in between two floodplains tiles. For example if the IZ west of the marker wasn't there, then it would be a valid position. Just need floodplains on either side of the river, while in your current placement there's only one. For instance, if the rice directly west of Haarlem is a floodplain, then either that tile or the tile north-west of Haarlem would be valid as it would cross a river and have a floodplain on either side. Does that make sense? Dams only take up one spot but they still require two empty floodplains on both sides. Hope I'm explaining that correctly.
