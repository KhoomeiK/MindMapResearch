depression,ffa1hc7,t1_ff9jtfl,1579725983.0,"Yeah, I really should put some money away. Just in case..... 

Thanks for the advice and kind message."
depression,ffa06lv,t1_ff9t3fb,1579725223.0," yeah I will try to look around while staying there.

Thank you so much for your message."
depression,ff8qs02,t3_cml6ni,1579692233.0,"Cried every day since I started my new job. There is this one higher up who makes it a living hell. I get a long with every body else but as soon as she steps in everything I do is wrong. I am to slow etc... Which makes it so hard to continue to work.

I wish I could stay with the other coworkers....

For the long run I do not want to stay here but only because of this one higher up I hate it so much that I just want to quit immediately. She treats me the worse. 

I don't really have the money to quit.

Waiting for a sign. 

Something needs to happen, I know that and I am open to something new. I am so sad. 

Thanks for reading."
lawofattraction,ff5t8d7,t3_eqdrlk,1579609367.0,"Trying to manifest my dream job where I can stay for a long time as an introverted depressed being.

Got a job last week but it's really shitty. Don't see myself there in the future.

Please give me strength. I am open for change.

Hope all your dreams come true."
depression,ff5qo25,t3_cml6ni,1579606355.0,About to go to work. I hate this job. I really hope something better is coming and trying to manifest it.... Please give me strength.
depression,ff4h5hf,t1_ff0apzp,1579563494.0,"It happens. It's totally OK to be sad and feel emotions.

Try again. You are not alone.

Sending you a virtual hug."
depression,ff4guj0,t1_ff1l6u4,1579563287.0,"I am pulling you out of the water. I am drowning aswell... Sometimes but today I pull you out.

You are not alone. We all struggle to be fine sometimes. Let's stay afloat together.

No need to be embarrassed here. We are all struggling together and helping each other.

Lots of hugs for you."
depression,ff4fh32,t1_ff4def3,1579562350.0,"Since I live in Germany the Services I use probably do not apply to you but I am sure there must be several services out there which offer the same as a written service. 

(one time I had a bad experience but the cool thing is that I was able to keep writing with the same person if I wanted so.... This did make it easier and just taking my time to spell it all out made it more clear for me. I still have all the positive emails with the same person. So technically I can go back and read the thoughtful written messages or just continue the conversation.)

I just wanted to share my thoughts because I had several conversations with people with real issues like addiction who called the Hotline etc but... some were just so unprofessional and unhelpful... 

I get that you might want to speak to somebody but writing down something whatever you want can help too. 

There are also other reddit threads. (kindwords or some for suicidal thoughts etc) 

Once again I feel so sorry that you had a bad experience. It really shouldn't happen... And it truly makes me angry. 

I hope that you find something which suits you. Sending you lots of hugs."
depression,ff4dinx,t1_ff3aaty,1579561047.0," I often blame myself aswell for the past but You know... Just blaming our self does not really help and we can not change what happened only the future. 
People come and people go. Technically the whole world is open to us.

Don't be too hard on yourself. 

Wishing you all the best. Tomorrow is another day."
depression,ff4cr6f,t1_ff3b9wi,1579560549.0,"I am sorry. I heard that most of them don't get training and some don't even get paid which is so dangerous. We have real issues and hope to get professional advice in a serious matter.

I am so sorry. I haven't had a single good experience yet with the hotline. I tried similar services via email and it took days to get a response but at least it was thoughtful...

Life sucks often, I won't deny it and the pain doesn't magically disappear.

Sending you lots of strength and hugs."
depression,ff46sc9,t1_ff2vudo,1579556784.0,Thank you for your kind words. I hope we both reach our goal. Sending you lots of love and hugs.
depression,ff2suvo,t3_cml6ni,1579522704.0,"I hate myself. Feeling like I am pretending to be all what I am not. Just started a job barely a week ago and already hate it.
Thoughts cloud my mind. Just want to find something where I can go work and go home without hating it. Praying something to happenüôè"

It's totally OK to cry. Sometimes it needs to get out. Sending out a virtual hug."
depression,feds47l,t1_fed27yi,1579018710.0,"I was jobless for over one year. I know it's hard. Many don't even take the time to reply....

Just got a job starting tomorrow. It's nowhere near what I wished for but I will try...

I understand that living with your mom is not ideal. But it's only temporary.

I also had to move back home several times in my life and it was not fun....

You are not alone. Sending out a virtual hug."

I also regret many things I did in the past but we can't turn back time.

We gotta keep on going.

Sending you a virtual hug."
depression,feb1spf,t1_fe5efk9,1578954624.0,"In the past I also imagined to just die in an accident... But than I thought that after I die many people would have inconvienences because of me.

My parents also don't understand depression. They pretty much think it's lazyness and an excuse.

But depression is a real thing. You know it. I know it.

If your family does not help there are also other places to get help or ways to share the problem anonymous.

Sending you a virtual hug."
depression,feaztpx,t1_fe5vbpc,1578953980.0,"I used to work in a call center where no one really noticed if I was there or not. People were replaced all the time.

But it's not our fault that some company operate like that.

Maybe as a work force they can replace you but that doesn't change that nobody is like you.
That's the difference.

Sending you a virtual hug."

depression,feaxzs9,t1_fearuin,1578953381.0,"I am sorry to hear. Please keep on going. As a shy introverted person I also struggle with communication and most job environments prefer outgoing active personalities. I have not been able to find a job where I can fit in as an socially introverted person yet, but I am trying finding my right fit... It's hard.

Please don't give up. You will be missed. Sending out a virtual hug."

Sending out a virtual hug."
depression,fe5udzy,t1_fdrgpya,1578875161.0,"I got an job offer and accepted it after being jobless for over a year but before the first day starts I already don't want to go. The grass indeed always looks greener on the other side. I see other people happy in their job and wish I could be like them. Be an youtuber or work from home or being a digital nomad.

I can relate to your post. You are not alone.

Sending you a virtual hug."
depression,fe5ttz1,t1_fdtrdq5,1578874797.0,"True. As a kid I just did what I wanted without thinking . Now even games can't distract me from this sh... Life and all the thinking. But we gotta keep swimming.

depression,fdljyna,t3_elx3vg,1578525720.0,"You can always start. Just try it. Only if you start something there can be change.

I also struggled in school. Never got a higher degree and was unable to study therefore worked in several low payed jobs...I am currently jobless again since one year but through the jobs I managed to experience something. I also met my now bf.

I am 29 and sometimes my past catches up to me and I am sad that I couldn't do better in school etc.. 

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time but that is not possible so we can only forward. 

I also connected with people on the internet... People will come and go but it was nice for the time it last. 

 I also had phases where I was unable to do the basics. I don't judge you. It's hard. 

We can not turn back time. We can only change the future. Start small. It can be little things which make a difference. A tea, a shower or other small things. 

Wish you all the best."

Now I still feel way happier in my dreams. In fact it's like I live a double life there where I am just me but better...

 Those memories  do spark joy so in RL you can still hold on to them. I don't judge you.

Wishing you all the best."

Congratulations üéä I left my job one year ago and I know somewhere inside that I wish I could start with YouTube or any other job where I can connect but I still didn't. Even though my thoughts revolve around it. I got a new job offer where I can start next week but I already know that this will not make me long term happy. 

Thank you for sharing your experience. Be proud of yourself :) I wish you all the best"
