California just tried to ban Bibles a while back -- not directly, but the law they were using could apply to Bibles very easily and they told the public they'd never use the law to do that. We were supposed to trust them?

California just declared the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. Meaning, sending them money is an act of supporting terrorism.

The Patriot Act allows you to be detained indefinitely, without trial. The only requirement is that the government call you a terrorist.

Imagine if, a sheriff didn't like you, called up the NSA and said, I need dirt on this guy. They then forwarded a conversation you had with your mother from 10 years prior and, because the current political party didn't agree with your ideologies (let's say it's Republicans and you're gay. Or you had a conversation, via text about being gay with a minor -- very real, as it's illegal in Russia), they called you a terrorist and put you in jail indefinitely -- also a constitutional violation.

opensource,feqaq13,t3_eqckyg,1579339561.0,"I'm not as active in it as I used to be, but the game has changed and a lot of FOSS fans haven't changed with it.

FOSS was originally about being able to fix problems yourself. Go back and read the books and watch the documentaries. Stallman said people should be able to fix software without going to jail for copyright violations. For the most part, that's happened today. Microsoft's code is open. Apples. Oracle's. Etc.

The problem is, an entire movement grew out of that because society demanded it. Back in the day, FOSS was seen as Communist and we all know communism isn't productive.

So, hackers literally had to work together to show the world that sharing code to fix problems was more secure than having a single individual working on a program.

But for-profit companies are for-profit companies. Once they realized that letting people fix things that were broken was beneficial, they dive in head first. The GNU has never forbade money and software from mixing. It simply said users should have access to the source code for the software they buy so they can fix problems that arise.

It's like a phone. If you purchase a phone, you should have a right to fix it, if it breaks. Doesn't mean you still don't have to buy the phone.

smallbusiness,fepq727,t3_eqaq1m,1579327618.0,"First rule of business, or at least what they tell us copywriters, make sure there's a market before you start a business.

If you don't have a market, doesn't matter if you're selling the best food on the planet. People won't buy it.

If you already have a product (your case), you need to find your market. Start with a wide range of people and then start narrowing it down.

For example, if you notice only a certain group of people like your food, figure out why they like it. Then if only certain people within that group like your food, figure out why.

For example, Borox

Anti vaxxers like to avoid chemicals. No surprise, most of them are naturalists.

A lot are also stay-at-home moms and have free time.

A lot of them make their own products at home.

Borox is used in homemade laundry detergent. A lot of anti vaxxers do it.

Without looking it up on Google, I can promise you, there are a crap ton of articles telling how pure and safe Borox is. How it's a natural and pure alternative to laundry detergent. And I can promise you, Borox manufacturers are using those exact words in their ads.

They found a market, narrowed it down, narrowed it down again, and that's who they cater to.

A lot of businesses go all out, trying to appeal to everyone. HUGE mistake! They go belly up in no time. Hot Topic is for the emos. A & F is for the preps.

God is a bully but getting rid of God doesn't solve the problem, at least according to anthropological data. Zeus' followers were relentless when it came time for him to die out.

If anything, societies which practice religion are statistically more peaceful because the religion tells everyone what their identity is and what their purpose is. Religion serves as a form of social DNA. And the body is designed to attack foreign pathogens for the body's (society's) safety. Christianity developed an extreme immune system. But the building blocks of that immune system are at the core of human nature.

That being said, just because there are benefits, doesn't make it true. What I mean to say is, it's not the abrahamic faiths at all. It's humanity. Complex organisms tend to reproduce, what's happening to them on the micro level, on the macro. There are immune cells, and DNA, and lungs, and a brain in all societies.

Research shows note-taking to be a powerful memory aide and potent productivity booster. Keeping the brain active during dry meetings and boring lectures can be the difference between razor focus and falling asleep.

But with the overload of information presented in these meetings, it can be hard to keep up. One might be tempted to sign up for one of the various AI ""assistants"" on the market but if research is to be believed, this can be counter-intuitive -- having a less-than-desired effect. Instead of increasing focus, note-taking is passed to a computer and your mind is left to wander. No wonder first-world nations are less productive than their third-world counterparts!

What Can You Do?

Human conversation takes place between 120 to 160 WPM. The average person types around 40 WPM. And the average typist? Anywhere from 50 to 120 WPM. Even at full speed, a professional typist meets the bare minimum for keeping up with the human voice.

All this typing can leave you feeling strained and diverts your attention -- that's the opposite of being focused! And it definitely isn't productive.

""Slow down Professor!""

So, What's the Solution?

What if I told you, your note-taking needs could all be met with a 130-year-old technology? That you CAN take down all the important parts of a meeting and, that you CAN keep up while maintaining the focus you need? Interested?

Not yet?

What if I told you, this same technology was taught in every high school in America for nearly a century and that your grandparents and their parents before them, used it on a daily basis to achieve writing speeds of over 200 WPM?

This is a joke, right?

The basis of this technology can be learned in a single afternoon and put into use, the very next day. It relies on nothing more than a pen, a piece of paper, and a human mind. What is this technology?

Gregg Shorthand

Invented in 1888, Gregg Shorthand was created to ease the process of writing and taking notes. With a world-record speed of OVER 275 WPM, it boasts a distinguished history serving medical facilities, science labs, legal offices, secretaries, courtrooms, and world-renowned journalists, only to be replaced in the 70s by a machine achieving less than one-sixth its speed -- the modern day computer. And with all the advancements of personal computers, they still can't get note-taking right.

AI has a 95% accuracy rate -- tops -- when transcribing text. That means, for every 100 words, you lose 5 of them. As a professional, you know how important 5 words can be. Your meetings are then placed on hold, while you go in to correct the mistakes. Why not take the correct notes to begin with?

With its simplistic design philosophy and quick motions, Gregg allows notes to be taken literally faster than the speed of sound, giving you the time to both focus on what's important and get down all the details you need to do you job.

Imagine sitting in your next board meeting and being able to repeat back everything that was said, with perfect accuracy!

The basis of this simple system -- its alphabet -- can be learned in a single afternoon. You'll immediately gain a boost in speed and feel less strained while writing. From there, it's simply learning the rules, which are modular. The more you learn, the faster you write. If you forget one, your speed decreases but the system remains completely usable.

Gregg offers several editions to meet your individual needs, with a learning span of anywhere from a few years to just a few months. The more advanced versions offer the highest writing speeds.

There is:

\- Gregg Anniversary, which offers the highest speed but also takes the longest to learn. Was taught for legal and scientific documents.

\- Gregg Simplified, which was created with the feedback of publishers and teachers.

\- Gregg Diamond Jubilee, which was most popular in high schools because of the short learning period

\- Gregg Series 90, a simplified version of Diamond Jubilee.

If you'd like to get back to laser-focus and keeping up with what's really going on in your office, I urge you to give Gregg a try today!

I've been using the Anniversary Edition for 6 months now. I typically finish a private 3-page (A4) journal entry in under 10 minutes."

opensource,fcjak1e,t1_fcij8zf,1577681416.0,"Why does everything have to have a certification? If you know what you're doing, you use the more advanced browser. If not, you use the less advanced one. It's no different than using new software. Inexperienced users don't install new software because they fear viruses. Experienced users do.

Why certify?"
opensource,fchtm07,t1_fch5vwm,1577653981.0,"I can agree with that and yeah, I was conflating the two for simplicity sake mostly. I'm assuming semantics -- in this case -- are the properties of each element and rules for structure.

Think of my design more as using OpenGL to render graphics and lay text over them. If you want to create a border in OpenGL, you either have to draw a line or put a shape within a larger version of itself. You also have to choose a color before drawing your line. Then you choose to fill the completed shape or leave it empty. 

There are no properties and the browser itself would be semantic-free. Essentially, my design would have the developer draw everything, with the ability to import libraries of other drawings.
The only rule to this would be, there had to be a json root/main key. That's what specifies page structure.

Other than that, once a shape had been defined in your document or externally, you just point to it in the main function and it's drawn on screen where you want it. There are no properties or semantics. It's purely drawing and overlaying text.

As for your other post, was going to open source project and hope other solutions came to light. But at the same time, was hoping to use V8 for some background coding."

I'm arguing for a limited number of primitives (base units) that a developer may build up to something as complicated as they need their site to be. That way, anyone, taking into consideration the primitives, can make a competing browser.

You're confusing available options with complexity. All atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. How many elements are we up to now?"
