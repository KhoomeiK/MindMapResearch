hydro,ffmzyhn,t1_ffmu08k,1580060615.0,The internet is a strange and wonderful place. I want to understand the life of a ladybug farmer.
Veterans,ffgty9p,t1_ffgr9w4,1579914987.0,"Could be anything, family, friends, coworkers. Whether it's having trouble fixing something around the house, financial stress, or work.
Most of my jobs after getting out I've asked a coworker, supervisor, boss for advice on dealing with a stressful situation it's the same ""Well you were a Marine so I know you can figure it out/handle it.""
Today having my supervisors tell me they are worried about me (mentally) asking how to help. Then I spill my guts, my concerns, asking what I should do because I can't figure this out.... ""Well you were a Marine...""."
hydro,ffgce6c,t1_ffe1302,1579903129.0,"We believe the first time was a buildup of nutes on the cubes, either way the plants survived. This second time with WD-40 the leaves got slimy and fell apart under water. We cleaned and sterilized everything, completely redid the res, and put the plants in a storage closet with a lock that only teachers and one student have the key to. If this doesn't work then we probably have bigger issues."
hydro,ffdrmvp,t1_fepjicz,1579827233.0,"It appears that we have some saboteurs on our hand. Someone sprayed WD-40, on the plants or in the res. I don't know who, how, or why. But you can't mistake that smell. I'm very sad today."

hydro,ffaantk,t1_ff8wpjc,1579731170.0,"Plants looked fine when we got back yesterday, today many of the leaves were slimy and smelled like WD-40. Current hypothesis is that we have a sabotage on our hands."

gardening,ff22vvg,t1_ff21q2x,1579492321.0,"Strange it didn't even start out with any regular leaves it went straight to this. The leaves still taste fine, so I'll have to harvest while that's still the case.
I was paranoid that I accidentally was given a Malabar spinach."

Thank you for the insight, and please keep your fingers crossed for our little plants."

hydro,fepfzt9,t1_fep99wd,1579319548.0,"It wasn't really squishy, slimy or crunchy just kinda there,  I dunked one in water and a lot of it washed away, but still had a nice white haziness to it. I had my students wrap foil around the tops of the cups to block out any excess light. 

Rockwool was stored fine in a closed cabinet away from moisture, light, etc. If anything I was extra careful to wash my hands had my students do the same. Scrubbed the totes, sprayed with a little acid, washed again. 

I figured I should take any precautions I can since this is the first project at the school we have tried at this scale (30 plants). 

I started a new batch of seeds just in case, I would rather have a bunch of plants I don't need because I overreacted to something silly then to not have them ready to go."

Everyone in this sub is wonderfully kind, patient and helpful."
hydro,fenuh7o,t1_fenmdkm,1579290958.0,"It went from at least visually fine in the germinator with only water, to like this within 16 hours. This is a new tote, but otherwise I sanitized it as I usually do. One of my students prepared the nutes, I've never had this much buildup before, could it be buildup of magnesium on the cubes?"
hydro,fent3u1,t1_fenaili,1579290382.0,"Yes about 5 of them, but I sprayed all of them just in case.

I'm not sure what happened, they just entered the tote late yesterday, but were only in water before that."

On Google it was an immaculate site for any gardener, but when we arrived it was nothing but dirt, and a tiny broken pot that said ""mi"" half buried in the ground. Over that first month we learned the reason no green grass would grow over half the yard was because it belonged to the mint. At first we were over joyed we made mint tea, mixed it with our ice cream, but soon we grew tired and mowed it over to never be seen again. Until three days later when it grew angry and became 6 inches tall again I mowed it, and this time spread out further. This time I put round up on it, then bleach, then boiling water, but it only grew angrier each time. So I resigned to mowing it each week and watching the deer roll around on it at night. When we moved out I drove away knowing that soon mint would own this house."

hydro,fbmywft,t1_fbmqsrz,1576990549.0,"We went with the crop king desktop system. I'm somewhat well versed in hydro, but my gardening counterpart in the construction trades department isn't, but is fascinated by the concept. Despite my knowledge I have the handy skills of a wet sponge. Reasoning for picking crop king being that it would cover the hardest part for me to explain, while giving him a physical view of NFT and how it works(the dream being scaling up something I can't construct, but he can).

Lights Sansi LED grow lights 30W. Picked because I have had success growing with them in the past plus cost. This is my weakest point of knowledge. I have read about everything SAG posts but I can't make heads or tails of it. Our dream goal would require solving this shortfall, but for now these meet our needs.

Plants mostly lettuce varieties from my collection of seeds and donated by some seed companies. I planted ones that had unique looks or flavors to be eye catching. One farm is kale type greens, cherry tomatoes and peppers. Mainly to get across the diversity of crops hydro. 

In the end we will have a small ""frame"" to hold the systems and allow the lights to be adjusted. Rather than quickly buy an aerogarden I wanted this to be something students took ownership over by maintaining the plants, and building parts of it themselves."
