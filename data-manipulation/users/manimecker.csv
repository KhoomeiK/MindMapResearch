See, I'm a smoker, so I totally understand you. But you really need to start being more empathetic with other people and understand that most of them really dislike smoking, even if they don't tell you anything about it. This girl has a real medical problem, you really need to respect that so they can respect you back.

When I smoke and there are people I know who don't, I step really aside and enjoy my smoke without affecting anybody but myself. You need to respect boundaries, and people like you really give a bad look to smokers (yeah, we know we are killing ourselves, no need to tell us everyday)."

I'm 24 as well, my mom was 47, so I completely understand what you are going through. She also died suddenly and unexpected. No warning, nothing. She was healthy, hell, she was way more healthy than I am right now.

Now the only thing I have left is debt, no money, cigarette addiction and a massive depression that won't go away.

I would be upset (and angry for a while) if someone reported her account (and it was deleted) before I was able to copy all the photos. We will be getting the account deleted, but just not quite yet. From a personal point of view, please consider the family of those people before reporting the accounts. If you don’t want to see the account please consider just defriending the account.

It's not your mother that died, you have way less privilege to decide what to do with her Facebook account than her daughter. You fucked up, and you know it. She being drunk or not doesn't make you less of an AH. She's grieving, and I can tell you that because my mom also died and I find peace on her Facebook account, specially because she left so sudden and unexpected. I can have access to whatever messages you want, I don't fucking read them, I just see her pictures, cry, smile and log off. 

Next time talk to her before taking something really big away from her. I would be devastated if someone went and legacy out my mom's account. I will do it when I'm ready."
AmItheAsshole,ff82zey,t1_ff6lec1,1579664621.0,"I understand, but ultimately she was my mom, I don't care who she messaged with and what, checking her photos and old updates helps me to cope and smile, cry and smile again (I can't use my own Facebook because my account got disabled for whatever reason so I can't use it anymore, planning on getting a new one soon though). 

So, to make things clear, I do not see her messages and never will, she died a year ago. I just don't care about them, all I want to see is my mom, that's it. And I said earlier that I take prevention steps to avoid all you say: I disabled Messenger (so no delivered status), always inactive status so it doesn't show to others and never use it for something else than checking her own profile.

There was a time when I had to dig into all her personal info for her life insurance and other needed passwords and data, that was the only time I actually searched her phone and account for something needed.

Is the way I cope with things, and eventually, like I said, I will turn her account into legacy, but I'm not ready yet."

Sometimes my grandmother wants to publish some information regarding my mom, so I use my mom's profile to post because she had a lot of friends, family, acquaintances, coworkers and so on, so that's the only possible way they can get to know about something.

I still log in sometimes to watch her published photos because I miss her and I don't want to forget her. No, I do not spy on her messages, they will always be untouched, and I disable Messenger and I put the account offline all the time, so other people don't see she's ON.

I actually dropped out of college three times. I thought of killing myself several times, but I only tried twice. I was dealing with massive depression from teenager trauma. I also felt the same way you feel (sometimes I still do, but way fucking less than before), I was feeling useless, with no future, broke, no friends and wasting all my money left on drugs or alcohol. But all of this didn't lead me to anything positive, right the opposite, it put me on the deepest hole of my life. I ended up having an abusive relationship with a girl, did a lot of stupid things with her. I almost got arrested once because of my stupid decisions. It all came to a big realization of myself, when I had lost everything. I literally stopped giving a fucking fuck about others. Others have it easier? Fuck yeah. Others have it better? Hell yeah. Others took better decisions than me? Of course. But have others learned what I've learned so far? Fucking no. I know what it means to be alone, to be left behind, to see all your friends doing great while you are in the same place, stuck for 5 years so far. 

Wanna know how I'm changing my life right now? I stopped giving a fuck about what I've wasted and started giving a fuck for what I really wanted to do. I lost it all, trust me, I lost it all. I broke up with that relationship, I stopped going to uni (didn't even say anything, literally just stopped going and never went back) and started to work my ass off to save enough money to get back to college and get my real wanted degree. I'm now doing ok, not great, because my mother died a year ago and life has been really fucking hard since then. It's hard to pay bills, college, rent, and support my little brother at the same time. I'm 24 btw, but feels like I'm fucking 35 by now. I still have problems, oh boy I have them, but they are not affecting my life decisions like before. I still cry, I still vent everything to the air, I still miss my mom, and I still have bills to pay from my mistakes in the past. I'm so deep in debt, but I really don't care, I can't fix it right now so it's not worth to think about it, I will fix it when I can. Right now I'm just surviving, but I have a goal in my mind: get my degree. YOU REALLY NEED TO STOP TORTURING YOURSELF WITH THE LIFE OF OTHERS. THEY DON'T MATTER ON YOUR LIFE. I know it's hard, but you really need to force yourself to stop doing that shit. You will always lose if you compare yourself to others. You should really compare yourself with your better versions of yourself, your future self. Then you can start doing changes towards it.

You should really try counseling or therapy, whatever the hell you want to call it. It has been really fucking helpful for me, it's not perfect, but you can say whatever the hell you want to her or him and he/she will listen to you, and remember, you will be paying them to help yourself, so they won't threat anything, they will help you."
