The moment I’ve been dreading all year. My receptionist slowly opens the door as she leads an incredibly frail man into my office. She supports most of his weight, but her petite frame doesn’t even seem to notice it. As she gently sits him down in the padded chair, he gives a wan little smile to her and pats her hand tenderly. 

“Thank you dear....” he says, barely audibly, and receives a sad smile in return. I nod to her. “We’re alright for now, but please stay by the intercom.” I whisper to her as she passes on her way out. She gives a little nod and hurried out of the room. 

I look to my patient. For 50 years he has been coming to this practice, back when my grandfather ran the place. In all that time, every single visit has been steadily worse. Even back then he seemed ancient, his charts reading like those of an 80 year old man. In all those years, he never once gave a straight answer about his age. Always saying “old enough”. 

“You know”, I begin, chiding him, “if you came in more often, we could do more to help you...”. I give him a slow shake of my head, knowing somehow that it’s pointless at this rate. 

He gives a wheezy chuckle and shrugs lightly. “I get the one day off a year....and the travel is a nightmare.”  He suddenly gives me a piercing look, not menacing, just....knowing. Like he can see into my mind. “How were last years tests?”

I flick back a page on my charts and grimace. “Frankly, Mr Klaus, I don’t know how you’re here. You have nearly fatal heavy metal levels in your blood, especially lead and arsenic, your kidneys have all but shut down and your liver is failing. And this was all a year ago.” 

He signs lightly “Yes....that’ll be the electronics....that solder really does fume up...”

“Sir...we need to get you on chelation therapy immediately. Even then, I don’t know how long you have, weeks at most.”

“And you’re saying that based on last years tests then?” He says with a wry little smirk. “No, no....I think I’ll just let things take their course. I’ve had far more time than I’ve deserved”

I look at him for a moment, silent and pensive. His eyes suddenly look so tired. I kneel down to be level with him, and, in barely more than a whisper ask him, “so....are you ready to tell me then?”

He gives that look again, simply nodding. “You know.”

“What will happen? Who will do your job?” I ask, breathlessly

“It will pass on” he says simply, as he stands up slowly. He stands tall, extending his hand for me to shake. “It’s been a pleasure as always”

I shake his hand slowly, my mind blank. He lightly thumbs his nose with a smile as he walks out of the office, towards 2 short men in suits waiting for him with grim expressions, and out of my life forever...."
