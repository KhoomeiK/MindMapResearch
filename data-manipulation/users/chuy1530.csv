You can be about as picky as you want. You can also wait your entire lifetime before a kid who meets your requirements becomes available. Generally even asking for <2 means a long wait. And they’ll tend to place with families who they’ve worked with more, so if you’ve fostered several times and another family is refusing anyone over 2 (for example) they’ll tend to go with the first family."

CraftBeer,fewnajf,t1_fewi3vv,1579415555.0,"Here’s what you’ve got to get. When you spend money at a locally owned brewery that money stays local. That guy goes out to eat? It’s a local restaurant getting the money. That guy buys a car? It’s a local car dealership. That person buys groceries? Local store. Yeah, after a cycle or two the money is probably leaving eventually, but at least it’s cycling through.

You spend money at a corporately owned brewery yes, some of that money is staying local. The staff gets paid. But a lot of that money goes straight out of the local economy and to some board somewhere. It gets pooled into massive reserves, paid out to executives in obscene bonuses, etc. 

I don’t buy 100% local (80% of what I drink is homebrewed anyway but that’s another story). There are some corporate owned beers I really like so I buy them. But it’s an informed choice, and all else being equal I’m buying the locally owned stuff.  And everyone else ought to consider it too."

Too young to worry about that now, but definitely something to think of down the road. My daughter takes dance lessons too (she’s only 4 so it’s more ‘something fun to do’ than serious) and the owner of the studio is only in her late 20s and doing extremely well for herself."

Not wanting to date someone who is trans is fine. It sounds like you handled that aspect with maturity. She does too, in that moment, although really that’s something she ought to have put on her Tinder (unless she isn’t out about being trans and doesn’t want people who know her that come across her profile to know, which is a possibility.)

It’s kind of weird when someone is only interested at all in meeting people to date and isn’t open to the possibility of just meeting someone cool and being friends. I get it, I’ve been in that boat, but it’s not a great boat to be in. I get that’s your primary reason for being on an online dating site (I guess people use tinder for more than hookups now?) but your life is a lot deeper when you’re willing to just meet people. Here’s someone you apparently had something in common with, across the table from you, have the meal and talk! When people are only potentially interested in dating it leads to forcing a relationship that shouldn’t happen, since anything else is set up in your mind to be a failure."
