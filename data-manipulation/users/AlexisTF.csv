For real though, there's a lot that 13 y/o me would be proud of or excited for, even just with what has happened in the past month. I did end up losing my virginity, started dating one of my best friends (related lol), and I started hormones so I could finally transition. I'm not sure if I was out as trans even to myself at the time, so that one would be hit or miss. 

Young me would definitely be excited for my girlfriend *and* the gaming PC I built. I'd be happy to move on from whatever garbage computer I was using at the time"

Granted. Your ""son"" is trans and she is now your daughter. You had better support the shit out of her.

This past week I started ""dating"" my best friend and I was never happier. However, she tried to break up with her boyfriend and they ended up discussing polygamy with me involved. I was never asked about it, and I know I wouldn't be good in a polygamous relationship. It's not for me. So everything fell apart. I feel as though I've lost the only meaningful thing in my life after just a week. I've never felt worse.

I think that everybody should be allowed to say it, although there should definitely be social repercussions if they say it in a racist context. Context is always very important. And now that I'm thinking a bit more about it, I can't really come up with a scenario where ""nigga"" would be funny, but I'd rather not remove people's rights to say it. If somebody can say it in a funny joke without being racist, then kudos to them.
