While in some areas this is accurate it changes when we look at the whole world. As [IPCC Chapter 3 states](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/) \- 

""Increasing global temperature poses large risks to food security globally and regionally, especially in low-latitude areas (*medium confidence*) (Cheung et al., 2010; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014; Rosenzweig and Hillel, 2015; Lam et al., 2016), with warming of 2°C projected to result in a greater reduction in global crop yields and global nutrition than warming of 1.5°C (*high confidence*) (Section 3.4.6), owing to the combined effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events, as well as increasing CO2 concentrations.""

>At this point, I am certainly not convinced that there is an imminent catastrophic danger. Even the most dire of reports from agencies like the IPCC are based on the worst case scenarios with the most extreme (to the negative) variations of the input.

The majority of the IPCC Report is based around how to limit the damage, and results of 1.5C. [From the IPCC Chapter 5](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/Figure5.1-1024x612.jpg) \- when they touch on business-as-usual it's quite a lot more dire."

The most affected people live in low and middle income countries, some of which have experienced a decline in food security, which in turn is partly linked to rising migration and poverty (IPCC, 2012a). Small islands, megacities, coastal regions, and high mountain ranges are likewise among the most affected (Albert et al., 2017).

unpopularopinion,fdb8ebn,t1_fdaw2f6,1578254857.0,">it's really not that much to ask for you to take the final step and choose which sources to read

You haven't made a coherent point yet so I have no basis to begin looking at sources for the things you wrote.

You say things like - ""Just look at the UNs newest climate model (CMIP6) which hasn't been used in a single study that has shown human impact on the climate.""

CMIP6 isn't even complete yet, of course it isn't used!

The IPCC AR5 report used CMIP5 as it was the newest at the time, the next assessment report AR6 will use CMIP6 in 2021.

Stop listening to random YouTube people and look the information up yourself. I'll help you out and give you a link to the [CMIP6 overview presentation](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/images/modelling/WGCM/CMIP/CMIP6FinalDesign_GMD_180329.pdf) \- You can find the timeline on page 16. [This is linked directly on the CMIP website.](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6)"

aww,fdat9st,t1_fda71fy,1578249838.0,That's my current show to fall asleep to. It's fantastic.
unpopularopinion,fdasvhe,t1_fdaoemk,1578249676.0,"Decades ago it was known that staying on course would result in CO2 PPM of over 400, which directly results in increased temperatures, the ocean acidifying, and plenty of other issues you can read about yourself in the IPCC report if you would like.

No changes were made, so we hit those numbers and are moving well above now. It's not fearmongering when it happens just as expected.

If you mean fearmongering by fringe groups or media for clicks, yes those are just as dangerous as denialists."
unpopularopinion,fdar2tv,t1_fdanpv8,1578249143.0,"I'm sorry asking for sources offends you, but a random YouTube channel is not a source. That's why I ignored it.

If you, yourself, can't back up your thinking with real research papers then you should probably just listen to the consensus of those that study it - Man made climate change is real."

unpopularopinion,fdambq9,t1_fdaj49c,1578247661.0,"My point was simple, you said - ""In 2017 a massive solar storm occurred, the strongest in 12 years"". If this storm was as significant as you say then we should see a spike on that year, far more than those before. This did not happen.

If you would like to link some academic papers, and cite some of the areas you are speaking about, I would be happy to read it. So far you haven't said anything that adds up."

Just so I understand the rest of what you said - The data we track shows one thing, but you're sure that something that wasn't observed or documented had a different impact?

I get there is much we don't know, but this is a train of thought I won't follow you into. Especially as temperature rise is an ongoing trend. [Small gif from NASA.](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/globaltemps_agency_comparison_2018.gif)"
