Like, ive never been in a relationship and im pretty sure its also cus im barely on social media.

ADHD,ffk09aw,t1_ffjx5o4,1580011871.0,"Oh no, its fine hahah.

I initially went in for a ADHD evaluation. She just asked me questions about  my like. Like hobbies, relationships, friends,etc.

I think what stuck out as Autism traits , is the fact that i absolutely have no idea how to make friends lol. Not ""im socially anxious"". I literally have no idea (im learning tho)

I also have sensory issues, hate eye contact, get sensory overload,.  But what stuck out the most was the communication issue that are well known with autism. i have horrible communication issues, Im basically learning from scratch. Ive had to ask other people directly ""how do you make friends"" and write it down lol

ill pull straight from my diagnosis record lol. These are my ""autistic behaviors"" that the doctor recorded:

* rigid tendencies
* fixed interest
* distress during major changes
* sensory issues
* trouble noticing sarcasm
* stimming"
college,ffjmd2o,t1_ffixzm9,1580001576.0,"Lol idk why you're downvoted. People really act like talking to someone or getting the RA involved, solves this shit. 99% the time it fucking doesn't lol

I've been in this situation many times, and these kinds of people are usually selfish and filthy. They don't care if its a shared space either. If they dont wanna clean, they wont clean.

All I did was pretend my roomate / suitemate didnt exist. And stuck to my own space and kept it clean."
Asthma,ffedl1p,t3_et3qrd,1579844106.0,"I was diagnosed young. The doctor that diagnosed me was very good at informing my parents about my meds and what being diagnosed with asthma means and all that.

She retired like 3 years after that. The doctors I've had after that, didn't seem to care too much about managing my asthma.

The would forget to prescribe me new inhalers. They would make me do the peak flow test, and when they noticed i didn't have good results, they would just write it down and leave.

None of those doctors ever tried to talk about my asthma, or go into depth about managing it, or talk about a ""Asthma Action Plan"". I was apparently supposed to have one of those ""plans"", but i never have.

I was told before that i might ""*have COPD*"", even. The doctors didn't seem phased by this, nor did they have a in depth discussion with me about it. They just prescribe me an inhaler now, even though I've told them that it doesn't help me. I still cant breathe that well.

I'm now 20+ years old. My asthma isn't really under control at all. I just take it day by day. Managing my asthma has been basically...non existent.

I think doctors dont really take asthma seriously. I had no idea how to take the meds, there were no explanations either. i only, in the last few years, found out what a pulmonologist is. Everyone's asthma is different, and yet, i feel like doctors treat all the same.

I feel like I've had to teach myself everything about asthma + the meds + the triggers. I feel like the only way for me to get answers and for a doctor to seriously care, is to pay to see a pulmonologist."

badroommates,ff7asdp,t3_eriduf,1579644901.0,"You can talk to them about it...but thats not guaranteed to make them clean lol. Im speaking from experience.

I realized that most these people come from a home where their parents cleaned after them their whole lives. So if their parents arent at college with them, they let their environment turn into a pig sty.

I've tried being nice and talking to them, I've tried texting them, and then we met with the RA....None of those things worked. If they're fine with living in a disgusting environment , then they sure dont give shit about making others uncomfortable.

I honestly hate it. Because the are **no repercussions** for suite mates / roommates that dont do their part in cleaning...the RAs dont care because they're equally as filthy. 

It sucks because you can be as nice as possible and they still wont clean. you can tell them it stresses you out...they still wont clean.  Im practically seen as a clean freak at uni....when im really doing basic ass cleaning most the time.

If anything, college made me realize that i never ever want roommates...unless i absolutely have to have them. And people wonder why i never became friends with any of my suite mates / roomates"

This part of campus is like a 25-30 minute walk from main campus. And my uni is in a city where when we get rain, it comes down hard, fast, and last a while lol

And alot of times, the wind will come off the water, all wild like. So sometimes an umbrella is not an option, and my backpack will be too big to fit under my trench raincoat"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff3vi1g,t3_ergsxl,1579549753.0,"oh god, i feel this. Everyone around me is just ""*been there, done that*"" when it comes to sex and im like .....*sex???whats that??!* lol

But  i feel kinda the same way?? like, even on of my close friends just started having sex this year. And they gush and tell me how good it feels ad how now they dont think they can live without out it. And i cant be mad because id probably be the same way lol

It definitely something i wanna do, but i haven't met a single person who i could date. Id want to be in a relationship for a little while before i even dream of letting someone see me naked lol. I gotta trust them fully and completely first. And that hasn't happened yet.

And yea, i dont have confidence or self esteem issues either. i dont wanna do hookups, i wanna fall in love and then do all the fun stuff lol.

But i totally get where you're coming from. Everyone around is having sex and that's not a bad thing. But there's a stigma with being a virgin pass the age of like 20...so i definitely dont tell anyone unless i trust them.

I just keep in mind that the right people will come along in the future lol. And that ill know when that person comes along lol. And that you're not missing out.  I put myself at ease with the thought that  ill most likely be in a better place in the future, to where i can have sex alot lol.

Like right now, i dont have my own place, i dont own a car, etc. I wanna be able to bring my future significant other in my own car, to my own nice place, to have sex and stuff lol. Not have to worry about roommates or parents or anyone being nosy lol

I think the only time i get annoyed with it. Is when people are shoving it in my face more than usual. I had someone who wouldn't shut up for the whole day about how great sex was, and i kindly ask them to talk about anything else.  cus it had been 10+ hours of talking about that and my brain was about to explode lol."
ADHD,ff3s3fh,t3_erhnc0,1579547644.0,"Lol yea! after  i got diagnosed, i wanted to go back to yell at all my old teachers like *""I was struggling!!! i wasn't lazy, you nasty assholes!""*

But i haven't told anyone beside like...my one super close friend. And im not sure if they even fully know because i was super subtle about it.

I think its because were supposed to be sad about it lol. People are supposed to whisper ""*yea i heard they have ADHD...so sad :(*"".

 Its like we're not allowed to be happy about finally knowing the truth and being able to finally get help.

But im pretty sure if i ever got into a heated argument with anyone or any of the old teachers, id scream at them about how i was only failing because my neurodevelopmental disorders were undiagnosed and i needed help."
ADHD,ff3qqco,t3_erfkfx,1579546810.0,"I hate how we can never have this discussion because people automatically label it as ""**gatekeeping**"", when its not.

There's so many symptoms to ADHD.  Having just one doesn't mean anything. If i was only hyperactive, i wouldn't think i have ADHD. Now that plus executive dysfunction + Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria + all that other stuff...then thats when i considered i might have ADHD.

If you think you have ADHD, you should try researching about it and how it effects people with it. I read about well known symptoms of ADHD and also the not so well known one. I then listened to other people with ADHD talk about their experiences. After like 6 months i was pretty sure i most like i had ADHD.

Got evaluated like 2 years later, and i have ADHD and Autism! lol.

People do this same thing with Autism as well. They go ""*oh,  i dont like eye contact either! i must be autistic as well!"".*

I dont really ever get mad at people for this stuff, i just let them know that if they really think thy might have Autism or ADHD...That i would gladly help them try to figure out if they do. Usually if they dont think they really have either, they let me know tho."

You shouldn't feel uncomfortable or wrong. Everyone had to start somewhere. As long as its consensual and both parties are comfortable and ready, then I see no issue.

They also show no understanding or sympathy lol. cant tell you how many times ive seen dudes here comment some bullshit about how ""*at least women can get used for sex! at least yall can get laid!""* and think thats some smart valid comment. those comments get upvoted most the time too (*not a surprise*).

i dont post here cus the misogyny goes unchecked. But take the comments with a lotta grains of salt lol"
Asthma,feo56ms,t1_feo3sv8,1579295283.0,"Oh, my apologies then. Wish i could do that!

But i can definitely relate to being sick of it!"
Asthma,fenvg0v,t1_femhxq1,1579291506.0,"Lmfao what?? ""Most of asthma is mental"" ??? Not to be mean, but your doctor sounds like a quack.

Most people find out they have asthma from doing tests. Like...the numbers from the results dont lie lol. 

I had no idea I had asthma until my results came back and the doctor was like ""thats not where they should be...""

Like, I'm glad your breathing improved , but I dont think most folks asthma is ""mental"" lol."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fednr98,t1_fedafer,1579015966.0,"Oh this is such a great point!

I was like op in my teens, I never felt comfortable with make up and ""feminine"" things like dresses and skirts ,etc. Made me feel uncomfortable and not confident.

I found out in the future that I'm Bisexual and gender non conforming (idk if I'm nb yet or not lol).

In the past, I thought that's all I could be. A striaght cis girl. And that I HAD to be feminine, even if it made me uncomfortable. That I'm supposed to want and have kids .Cus society shoves it down our throats. that that's what we're supposed to be and supposed to do.

I just want op to know that theres nothing wrong with questioning. Theres nothing wrong if you decide youre non-binary or gnc. Even if you find out you're not striaght, that's okay!.

And I'm not saying all this to like, push op or anything. I just really relate to this post. For the longest time, I thought being a straight feminine cis girl was set in stone. And its really not."

ADHD,fe8qend,t3_eo42ex,1578929257.0,"I always say ""what was talking about???"" Lol

I'm pretty sure it annoys my family so much lol"
PublicFreakout,fdzxtm7,t1_fdyqigy,1578798431.0,"Im honestly not surprised, people are always eager to jump and confess how much they hate pitbulls.

they'll still say ""*all pitbulls should be put down!*"".  Any other breed gets leniency and understanding. But apparently pitbulls are the most evil aggressive dogs ever! /s

Other breeds bite and attack people all the time, and its ignored or its ""*blame the onwer!*"". But whenever a pitbull attacks, its ""*Kill that dog!*""

People who just hate pitbulls so much are just freaks , tbh. Any person that hates dogs or cats this much, is someone who has issues.  And not someone most people want around lol"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdzosv4,t3_en2phi,1578792520.0,"i know this post is almost a whole day old, but op: **This is not in your head. This happens all the time to many Women of Color. Myself included! Its because of racism and its not OK!**

The people in this thread downplaying this, is not surprising. Every sub on this site that focuses on one group, for example the LGBT sub and this one, have issues with racism. (*That they love to ignore btw*)

Thats a huge reason why i mostly just lurk here. cus people here can go ""*Yay women!!*"" and then turn around and treat the Women of Color in this sub like idiots when we talk about racism + misogyny that we deal with in our daily lives.

its pretty gross and lazy, tbh"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdzmp9m,t1_fdy2q1r,1578791791.0,"You're exactly right! I've just been rolling my eyes at people in this thread saying its *""probably body language""*...smh.

I've been experienced this treatment my whole life, and you know what? my body language has changed hundreds of times...only thing that stays the same is me being black lol

Women of Color *know* about this because ***we live it***....and this thread just proves what usually happens: white women downplaying the struggles we go through."
lonely,fdzcrfc,t3_en5t62,1578789022.0,"wow this exact situation is happening to me right now lol. i just texted them a week ago and got one response a week late....and no response from the other person.

I was fearful that once they switched majors, our friendships would fall apart because we wouldn't be taking the same classes / be around each other anymore.

my fears are sadly confirmed :("

ADHD,fdclnos,t3_ekgh0v,1578277984.0,"I remember when I was in high school and was really close to failing a chemistry class that was required for me to graduate.

I was seeing the school tutor everyday after school. She was trying to help me undertsand how to balance chemical equations.

And I remember not undertsanding it for the thousandth time and asking her to show me again. (I was the only student in there at the time).

And she told me ""didnt i already show you this? You don't get it yet??""

I never asked for her help ever again with anything and that was yearsss ago. I passed the class with lowest required grade.

THAT was the moment that finally broke me. I struggle to even ask for any kind of help now.

And it hurts that people scold me for beibg like this, too. ""You need to learn to ask for help sometimes"". Yea I fucking know....im getting better at it but its hard."

It makes me sick tbh. why would you choose to work with disabled people when you don't respect them or care about them?!?

Those ableist psychiatrist / psychologist will also be homophobic too! its sad because in the end, we suffer for their bigotry"
