RedLetterMedia,ffigvr6,t1_ffidtxl,1579973576.0,"Were you satisfied with rise of skywalker? I felt rise of skywalker didn’t address a lot of plot elements that last Jedi created. My perspective is as a fan of force awakens is that last Jedi, in my eyes, preemptively cut off several plot points that I was invested in before I felt they were fleshed out. If Rise of skywalker committed to what last Jedi was doing I think it would have strengthened the trilogy as a whole. The reason I don’t like last Jedi is rise of skywalker pretends it didn’t happen and tried to pick up where force awakens left off. So to me it’d be a more satisfying narrative if last Jedi was different/didn’t exist. From the perspective of someone who really enjoyed last Jedi, I could definitely see how rise of skywalker would be dissatisfying because IT drops a lot of the interesting elements that last Jedi created, like the Grey Jedi question, and how to balance the force without sith and Jedi. Rise completely ignores those interesting questions and tries to pick up where awakening left off"

RedLetterMedia,ffic7lb,t1_ffhtto8,1579970401.0,"For some reason the sequel trilogy went through development hell, and everything was rushed. If they had taken a couple extra years to plan, do some rewrites, not make last Jedi, it could have been decent. I don’t think the sequel trilogy is even comparable to LOTR because there obviously was no plan or the plan got absolutely fucked at some point *cough* last Jedi *cough*. LOTR was actually written, had setup and payoff for every subplot, and they took the time to do it right. But I don’t think I’ve seen blind praise for the sequel trilogy, every bit of praise comes with caveats and exceptions"

gaming,feknegu,t1_fekmv29,1579203667.0,"I’m not saying the soldier in the first panel is a boomer, I’m saying the concept of romanticizing soldiers from world war 2 and mocking the youth of today is conceptually typical of boomer humour. In reality many of the soldiers sent to die in world war 2 were basically children, 18 and 19 year olds. This comic seems to go no deeper than the concept “people from a long time ago = good, people today = bad” which is an extremely shallow analysis of the concept of war."
