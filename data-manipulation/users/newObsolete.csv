""From the time of the incident we suspected a possible drug interaction as the cause. Casey wrestled with depression for as long as we knew him. He saw numerous doctors and took an ever-changing array of medicines to get better. He finally had his depression under control. According to the toxicology report, the cause of death was due to a fatal interaction between depression meds, anxiety meds, and an opiate. Opiates being mentioned along with the term ""substance abuse"", coupled with ""rockstar"" stereotypes immediately conjure up images of hard drug use and addiction, which simply couldn't be further from the truth in Casey's instance. What the toxicology report doesn't show is that before our leaving for tour, Casey had a root canal, and he was prescribed Vicodin (an opiate) for the pain. Once again, Casey was not involved in anything illegal, nor was he a substance abuser."""

movies,fef9yez,t1_fef9egg,1579051655.0,"The system cares, but it's not family. As misguided and shitty as Pattinson's character is he still tried to do right by his brother by doing the only things he knew how to do to try to fix the situation. I guess that's why hes more sympathetic to me. Hes dumb and wrong and fucks everything up, but it all came from a place of love for his brother."
movies,fef5a1a,t1_fef4td9,1579048504.0,"Yup! But didnt you feel a little conflicted by it at the end? Like yeah,  his mentally disabled brother is better off, but Pattinson really tried for him and at the end of the night it just wasnt enough. Pattinson's character really loved his brother, even if he wasnt a good brother and  now his brother is stuck in a system that doesnt care about him at all. It was oddly bittersweet."
movies,feetmc9,t1_feery39,1579040946.0,"I'm not OP, but I didnt like it as much as good time. Pattinson's character was much more sympathetic in what he was trying to do and had some charismatic moments to add to the shittines of his character, like you wanted to like him even though you knew he was an asshole. Sandler's character just felt like a dude digging a hole until someone put him in it."

gamemaker,fdoayaf,t3_emf478,1578601920.0,Afaik there isn't a way to do it like that. You'll have to set up your menu different. I think the way I did it was to increment a variable when the stick was pushed and have the menu correspond to that variable. I hope that makes sense.
