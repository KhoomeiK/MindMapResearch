theunforgiven,fgkgbdc,t1_fgit6i0,1580864897.0,"Well, I managed to snag all the parts I could want except for the back of the torso and the storm bolter, so I'm set. I think I can get a spare storm bolter from a Dark Angels player willing to part with it fairly easily, and then I just need to get the standard Terminators kit, which I was already going to get, and get the back armor from there."
theunforgiven,fgkftgk,t1_fgkbhst,1580864561.0,"I know I can only use Deathwatch gear. (Though I'd totally proxy a Deathwing knight as a hammer and shield Terminator if I wanted that loadout. I don't think many would mind. My Space Wolf's frost axe already counts as a power sword.) He's going to be a standard storm bolter + power fist Terminator with missile rack.

I want the Deathwing parts for aesthetic reasons. If my Terminator is going to be a veteran of the Deathwing, I want him to look the part. I don't want to just build the standard kits, I want the members of my kill team to have some flair, something connecting them to their chapter beyond just the right pauldron. Look at what I have so far. The combi-plasma guy is also a Dark Angel, and I kitbashed him with bits from a DA veteran to give him the Inner Circle robes. My Space Wolf has a wolf fur cape, a frost axe, and a fancy wolf head backpack. My Salamander has a scale cape and a flame design on his leg armor. My Ultramarine is made to look like a Roman centurion.

If my kill team's Deathwing veteran doesn't look like one, might as well not even bother. Better make him some other chapter."
Tau40K,fgjerhi,t1_fgjcrpf,1580842513.0,"I recently converted 4 fire warriors into 3 firesight marksmen and 1 cadre fireblade with some 3D printed parts, and built the remaining 6 into Shas'ui with markerlights to swap with the ones without I already have as necessary. Not enough markerlights for all of them, but I had an unbuilt box of pathfinders I had to build special weapons gunners for Kill Team, so I went there and helped myself."
Tau40K,fgjdd13,t1_fgguq6q,1580841679.0,"Not OP, but I have a question: Can you uplink orbital markerlights? I'm expecting the answer to be no, since it mentions a markerlight fired by a model, but I'm open to a pleasant surprise."
Tau40K,fgjd06s,t3_eyhikq,1580841471.0,"If you mean unhelmeted heads, the kit comes with several of them. The backpack antenna and bonding knife are singles, though. But what really designates a fire warrior as a Shas'ui is having the helmet antenna painted in the color of the sept markings instead of the main armor color.

What I ended up doing was giving the antenna to one and the knife to the other and painting their helmet antennas accordingly."

killteam,fgg0hx9,t1_fgf3eyr,1580751595.0,"Aura abilities kinda end up having longer range, as the base diameter doesn't count for measuring that, but that mostly only matters under Commanders.

Tau are actually pretty mobile in Kill Team, with their high numbers of flying units and lack of heavy weapons (rail rifles are, surprisingly, rapid fire), so if he's not moving up the board, claiming objectives and setting up kill boxes with overlapping fields of fire, he's not playeng them to their fullest potential. 

Also, most people play with too little terrain in their boards, which unfairly favors long-range shooting teams. Try to take a look at the layouts tournaments use and see if you're doing anything wrong."
