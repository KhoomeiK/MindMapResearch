aww,ffdehxt,t1_ffd2lyo,1579819184.0,"Same thing happened with the heeler mix we've had for 5 years now. When we went to meet him he was running in circles and was just BARK BARK BARK non stop. Body slamming our other dog and was just WILD. My husband gave me a look like ""omg this dog is insane, no.."" But I was already falling for him. Took him home, trained him, exercised him and within a few weeks he was like a brand new dog! He wasn't allowed on the bed or allowed very much exercise previously and he was rightfully acting out. He was 9 months at the time so still very full of energy, but heelers in general need a lot more stimulation than most dogs. I'm glad we found eachother :)"

ChoosingBeggars,ffae6w3,t1_ffac4ea,1579733518.0,"Oh yeah, I'm a waitress and I get all giddy when people do this to me :) but not enough people do it. They are quick to complain but when you are doing great they don't always seem to notice... I will definitely start doing it more often! Such a simple act of kindness <3 you are good people!"
