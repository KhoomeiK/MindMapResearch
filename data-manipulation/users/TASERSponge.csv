Normally, the screens are on swivels and you line up and lock them to the image you’re going to make and then put a t shirt on the stand. There’s also printer versions now where the machine mixes the ink for you. I did this method in high-school applied tech with a scalpel, the green material we were using, and a screen. The material is glued to the screen with some liquid and then it is dissolved with some other liquid. In graphics, the same idea was used except we separated the image layers by color and then burned them into the medium material between the layers and screen with a high powered camera. Like others are saying I think the pictures were created on plastic and then transferred with paint after being adhered to the screen."

The only thing that calms it is biking but I recently was diagnosed with a hernia so I’ll have to stick to hiking. I’m going to miss my 6-pack.
