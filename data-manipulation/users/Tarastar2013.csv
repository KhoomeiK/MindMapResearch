relationship_advice,ffe1n0j,t3_et42jq,1579834358.0,"My fiance loves back scratches before bed, I always give him a back scratch and then I rub my hand across his back. It's become a ritual that we've done for the last 7 years.

I don't think you're overreacting, for me it's the little things that matter the most. Like meeting me outside to carry my backpack in the house when I get home from school, warming up my heating pad and blanket before I crawl into bed or even opening and closing my door. 

If he can't do the little things, then do you expect him to show up for the big ones. Just a thought."
nonononoyes,ff896e4,t3_erzijn,1579669683.0,"Thank you guys for understand where I'm coming from. I really don't care that much about the karma , I just wanted to share something cute with the world. I thought it might put a smile on somebody's face that could be having a bad day or that needed a smile. That was the main point for me cross posting it."
nonononoyes,ff77yl0,t1_ff76e3d,1579642897.0,"Thank you, I was looking for that one, but it didn't show up in my subreddits."
nonononoyes,ff77qzv,t1_ff6wf1v,1579642778.0,"I would completely disagree. I put that so it would belong somewhere else somebody would let me know.

1) I was trying to share something that was cute.

2) I've just recently started cross-posting and like I said before I was not quite sure it belongs there.

3) definitely not a karma whore. Just wanted to share. Thank you for your input though."

physicaltherapy,fepet4b,t3_eoxtz6,1579318722.0,"I know I already thanked everybody, but I wanted to thank you all again for your kind words and advice. It means a lot , it's nice to know the people that don't even know me are rooting for me. I know I'm going to do great and I'm going to become the best physical therapist I can.

Quick back story on why I've chosen physical therapy. I also just wanted to share a bit about me and my story of how I got here.

Ultimately the reason I became interested in physical therapy is because I've had 16 procedures since 2016 starting with a full hip and joint replacement. I currently suffer from complex regional pain syndrome otherwise known as CRPS or RSD. It originally started in my knee and after my full hip and joint replacement it's spread throughout my entire left leg. I spent the first year to two years in a wheelchair and if it wasn't for physical therapy I wouldn't be walking.

Through this pain and having to deal with all these medical issues (starting at 23 now 29) has opened my eyes to the medical community. Instead of getting beat down, moping and being depressed, I've chosen to become determined, stay positive and through this I hope I can show people that no matter what you have going on in your life physically or mentally you can do anything you want. I want to inspire other people to chase their dreams and be the best person they can be."
