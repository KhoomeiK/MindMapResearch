Libertarian,ffh5uce,t1_ffgxot6,1579923937.0,There's a phrase I like. Your rights end where mine begin. If we move to a cashless society then all private purchases will be tracked. I'm not okay with that.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffg3qj4,t1_ffg36cm,1579897804.0,When I break into homes and shoot children I go to prison because doing so makes me a monster. I don't know which is worse.

I dislike that police officers are part of the only profession where all members are blamed for the actions of one. I'm in petroleum engineering, I would be angry if people blamed me for Exxon Valdez or the BP spill. I've never been within a thousand miles of either place. 

I have met roughly a dozen cops. I liked two, was ambivalent towards ten, and absolutely despise one. That's about the percentage for everyone else I meet. I believe a lot of the pseudo hatred on reddit is due to the majority of the user base being young and with little life experience.
