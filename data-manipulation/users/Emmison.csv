1. Don't know. There are probably something in Stockholm, however I've read online some of those are toxic (people venting about things that are different from home -> whining -> pulling each other down with negativity) so proceed with caution.  
2. Making friends will be difficult. The most common way to meet people is through meeting regularly: job, school, associations. Even then it's hard to take things to the next level. I have close work friends that I've never seen outside of work. OTOH I never asked about hanging out after work, they might be willing. The kid could be useful although she is a bit old. Don't think daytime activities for 3yos is as common as baby things, but look into it. I also think you should put your daughter in preschool asap so your wife can focus on learning Swedish, that will help a lot.  
3. The kid will be fluent by the time she starts school. International school is not necessary. She will have mother tongue class in regular school.
