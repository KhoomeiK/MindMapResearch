TellMeAFact,fftlwjz,t3_ev6a0x,1580223900.0,'Knocked up' means to be pregnant. This comes from the old job of the 'knocker uppers' who used to get paid to wake households up before alarm clocks were invented. It was rumoured at the time the knocker uppers would go in and have affairs with women.

youtubers,ffne5cn,t1_fflnch4,1580064758.0,Just tried this in my community tab and it is a huge success already! This may be a winner if incorporated into a video.
youtubers,fflrhqq,t1_fflr9y7,1580043236.0,Yeah I can see how that would become an annoyance. They are so stupid because doing that literally destroys any chances of the algorithm picking you up.
youtubers,ffl5ptq,t1_ffiplru,1580035249.0,"I've never had those types of comments, I specifically mean swear words. If I can't use the word damn for example, I might not then leave the comment 'damn I miss the opportunity rover!' 

Do you censor swear/curse words?"
youtubers,ffl2nbq,t3_etybys,1580033664.0,Interesting. I've followed your channel for a while too! Did you do the poll in the community section or in video?
youtubers,ffigs9v,t3_etpvs1,1579973510.0,"Does anyone know if this has a positive or negative impact on views? 

I would imagine less comments means less algorithm."

PartneredYoutube,ff6p3ue,t3_eryjts,1579631933.0,"I wish I could stick to one.

I think people often conflate the word consistency with schedule. When people mention consistency it goes much deeper. It means consistent quality. Consistent theme. Consistent topics. 

If you can produce consistent content on a tight schedule, then even better. Yet I believe consistency is way more important than saying 'I upload every Friday at 8pm'. 

The schedule probably helps keep you on track and produce more content, which will naturally increase views and subscribers, but not through some quirk of the algorithm."

youtubers,feejgvs,t3_eoqpvz,1579034994.0,If you can get it above 50% that's really good. The more views you get the harder it is to maintain that 50%.
youtubers,fed3zjo,t3_eo8hp7,1578997675.0,I would imagine this video has a very high CTR. Welcome to the algorithm rollercoaster my friend :)

youtubers,fdxycgz,t3_en8hgx,1578774183.0,"This is an obvious massive effort on your part, but I think you have a big dilemma. It's up to you which path you choose. 

The humour is childlike, yet children will not stay around with the frame rate like that. You could make shorter vids with better frame rate and stick with the young audience. 

Or, if you aimed it at adults, it's possible they would stick around for longer with the frame rate as is. Kind of like a South Park humour. 

That dilemma aside, you are on your way to greatness my friend, and have earnt a new subscriber today!"
youtubers,fduh6f6,t3_emyqu3,1578732921.0,"Yeah, I had to delete a video that got 2 million views. It had no commentary so was a very foolish mistake. Now all my videos are super high effort and quality. Not had a problem since."

youtubers,fdtwvzk,t3_en24dj,1578723530.0,If not already done look into creating watch time traps. Make sure you have cards set up properly and video links in comments etc. Adds a couple of percent to your views but is really good for the algorithm to see that people are staying in your channel.
Bogleheads,fdtwifg,t1_fdtw31y,1578723349.0,Laziness and youth primarily. S&P has always outperformed any other index (I think). I live in UK btw. I'm aware I'm open to currency fluctuations but I'm not putting in a great deal at the moment as I don't earn enough.
