My husband and I live in rural Japan and finding any sort of almond flour or avocado oil etc. was out of the question. So, we started just eating local veggies and meat. Eventually we got a cost co card and we budget in a monthly trip to the Costco about 2 hours away and stock up on meat and cheese."

Keto_Diet,fd670tw,t3_ea7vo1,1578186448.0,Great job! Isn’t it amazing to think about how much weight that actually is? I’m down about 20 kilos and recently I went on a trip and one of my bags came in weighing about 20 kilos. All I could think was how heavy that bag was... and I used to carry that weight every day with me.
