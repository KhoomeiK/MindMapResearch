depression,ffiszr2,t3_etqbpl,1579981960.0,"Hi there!
I was in a similar situation back in high school.
I tried to confront the friends who have been bitching about me. I tried being nice, reasonable, and then at some point I just said fuck it, blocked everyone and left. They all knew I was dealing with problems at home, and they were too immature to break my trust.
After 6 months, my best friend contacted me and apologized. It took a bit of time for me to trust her again, but she showed me that she won’t do it again.
Moral of the story: if you respect yourself enough, you won’t allow this to happen. If they respect you, they will see what they did wrong to you and grow up and apologize. It hurts, but eventually you grow out of it and learn from it."

depression,ff8s3rs,t3_es440i,1579693908.0,"Wow, let me say first that I didn’t expect to wake up to all those notifications.
I would like to thank every single one of you for writing all those kind words. It’s very nice of all of you, thank you. I couldn’t wish for a better community :) 
I’m very tired these days, I work a lot and hard too. Plus, with the semester that started....
I try to convey my sadness and aggressivity in a non-harmful way, my only ways to do that is by playing video games and writing. And yesterday I just had this sudden urge to lay down and cry and yell all at the same time.
Never expected to have so many responses!
Thank you, every single one of you, for all your support and all the help that you gave me.
And don’t worry about the people around me: I love them with all my heart, and yes, they say things that for me seems pretty unfair, but I know they mean good. They have been trying in the past months to understand me better, and be more careful towards my needs and how I react to some situations, but sometimes they still slip, and I don’t want to hurt them, so I convey my strong emotions elsewhere. But they have been by my side through all my journey, and helped me the best they could, even though they saw me hurting and didn’t know how to help. So, I am glad this post also seemed to help people who relate to this feeling... 
Hang in there each and every single one of you, we can all make it. I believe in you guys."
BreakUps,ff7cjh9,t3_es221m,1579646383.0,"I never had a rebound, but I knew some people who did.
Mostly, they feel bad for having a shitty relationship, and they need to have someone else to help them patch it, and forget it, prove themselves they didn’t need the other person. While in fact, the only thing they are doing is damaging their own emotions and not taking care of them.
Also, the rebound might hurt less than the actual breakup they experienced before."

depression,fewj3ft,t3_eqrtwp,1579411585.0,"Somethings I wish I knew:
-Instead of seeing « failures » I see « experiences ». Everything is a lesson, not a failure. You only learn from the past and improve from it.
-Keep close every good deed you have done, closer than the bad ones. Although you must acknowledge the bad ones, you must allow the good ones to reflect who you are.
-Love yourself a little more everyday. In the end, the one who will be by your side your whole life will be you and only you."

depression,fewih77,t3_eqryjr,1579411206.0,"Saying depression is related to mostly sadness is a bit of a cliché.
Depression crawls into your life, and changes a lot of behaviours and habits. Beginning with the time you spend in bed, (either by insomnia or oversleeping) to taking care of yourself. 
I wish someone would have told me earlier, but... you need to take a break. At least, relax for a day,
And then, I recommend you to set yourself some objectives. Habitica is a good app for it. It may be something stupid, but it will keep you busy, and maybe give you some energy again to do what you want to do."
depression,fewhy06,t3_eqrzef,1579410896.0,"It seems you were experiencing symptoms of a panic attack. When you feel lots of pressure like this, your body tries to release it, but it seems like your mind was trying to stop it.
I’ve went through a lot of panic attacks in my life, it’s not always easy, but you can always come to talk to me if you feel the need to :)"
depression,fewh9fw,t3_eqs2p0,1579410555.0,"So, you think that becoming a person that loves manipulating people, feels no guilt doing so, has very little if no real attachment would become a better solution to your problems?
And if so, sociopathy develops itself through trauma and it shuts down the emotional part of the brain. 
The best solution in your case would be to learn to control and feel your emotions without them taking over you. Turning towards the « feeling nothing » would make you only more edgier and make you pretend something you are not, or don’t want to become, instead of being patient towards yourself and better yourself with the appropriate treatment.
Sorry if my words sound too harsh, I only want to help, but antisocial behaviour shouldn’t be a solution in avoiding your emotions. It only causes more pain. If you have any more questions, you can DM me :)"

depression,fe6lavs,t3_enzmg5,1578894701.0,"Hi!
I’ve been suffering from insomnia a lot as well during my depression.
I’ve tried many things: Sleeping pills, taking air, listening to relaxing music, relaxing sounds, or hypnosis too. There are also breathing techniques that release stress from the body, making you feel less stressed for 4 hours. 
Doing some exercises prior sleep helps too.
Reading a good book as well."

depression,fe6jpy9,t3_enxqyo,1578893128.0,"I know where you have been. It was a harsh place for me too and the Catholic Church. It’s believed that suicide is a sin, since it’s your life, a life of a children of God that is taken.
The Catholic Church is not at the same place as psychology of today, and your depression is nothing to be ashamed of.
Your father and your priest tried to help you in their very little means, it’s nothing against you.
Instead, seek therapy or help from a professional.
Explain clearly to your father how you have been. If he loves you, he will try to help you.
I know how it is. Been there with my mum. It was hard at first, but she is heartbroken everytime she sees me depressed. And she started reading about how she could help me, instead of relying on the Church. 
I hope the same for you!"

depression,fe6j1ve,t3_enx9k7,1578892482.0,"I’ve had this for a while as well.
Sometimes, it hurt people I love. But, I couldn’t always control this anger, so whenever I felt an intense emotion, I would write it down. So that it gives me time to rationalize and calm down when I write.
But, sometimes, when I was too depressed, I wouldn’t do it, still scared to hurt people, so I would turn this anger towards myself.
Not a very good thing either.
The best way to do so, it’s keep on writing how you feel, could it be here, or on a piece of paper and then make a ball out of.
Therapy has been helping me a lot on trying to control this.  Meds either make me feel numb or super intense in it."
