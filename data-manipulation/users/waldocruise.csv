But everything else I agree with. If our value above minimum wage is at a certain spot when we’re hired; it shouldn’t drop below that threshold if minimum wage is recalculated by the state.

And another nasty little secret of the business, unless your other job isn’t retail or is full time; most businesses have a busy season and a slower season where the hours will vary.
