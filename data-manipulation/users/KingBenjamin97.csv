Cutting everything down to a short length absolutely looks groomed it’s literally the same as when a girl doesn’t shave completely but just keeps it all short and neat. Am I saying he should avoid shaving certain areas completely? No but if dude is doing nothing right now he should just trim it all short and see what he thinks"
AskMen,fffrucz,t1_fffqhrv,1579890430.0,I would talk to them about how you feel about this though and say that while you do support them going you do feel that you need to be consulted about future decisions that affect you both. Your opinion should matter to them especially if you’re going to be apart for a significant amount of time. Like you’re talking months not weeks here it does genuinely matter that you’re both on the same page here.

I was going through some stuff extra pressure at the time, never actually cared about a girl before and knew we’d be living hours apart within the month all those combined made me try and stop feeling for her. We stopped talking for a while (about two months), we started again a while ago and still click perfectly and slip into flirty stuff by accident. She’s dating somebody now so we do call it out and actively shut it down when it happens but I dunno I’d be lying if I said if she becomes single I won’t ask her out and see if we can do it properly this time. I was freaked about actually having proper emotions for the first time (don’t know if I can say she’s the one but she’s the only one I’ve ever actually cared about out of all the girls I’ve been with) combined with all the other stuff going on and it made me make a terrible decision."

Clean yourself properly in the shower before they come over/you go there. You want to smell good and be clean just like you’d want them to be for you. (Also wash your balls, ass etc well bro you don’t want her to have stale sweat as the thing she remembers from a bj if you want another one in the near future). 

Buy proper fitting good condoms! Difference between it feeling awful and almost as good as nothing being on right here. If you’re using condoms as your contraceptive of choice then measure accurately and buy some good ones, don’t skimp on this a few bucks is nothing for how great the difference in sensation is. Personal recommendation if you want it is SKYN, they’re pretty much the best feeling I’ve found. 

Look up some “how to give oral videos” you want a basic idea then talk to her beforehand and tell her to guide you. Keep open communication and learn what she likes (no two girls are the same so this is always good tip for new ones). Foreplay isn’t an optional extra if you want her to enjoy it and not be in pain you need to warm her up first! 

Talk to her and tell her it’s your first time? Up to you but I’d probably let her know and say you want her to tell you what feels good. You want to make her feel as good as possible (prioritising the girl is a good thing mate it turns one night stands into multi weeks hookups good tip for your future + girls talk about this shit, you want a good review being circulated hahaha)

And have fun! That’s arguably the most important one. It’s a whole new world you’re about to enter into and it’s pretty god damn great just enjoy yourself don’t be under crazy pressure to perform or anything just talk to her and find out what she likes and you’ll be fine.

Do we enjoy it? Personally yeah, seeing a girl ripping the sheets off and shaking because you’re making her feel that good is pretty damn hot not gunna lie, that’s more than enough foreplay for me to be ready.

Does it turn you on? I refer you to the above. 

Is it an obligation/do it so she’ll reciprocate? For some I’m sure it is but nah for me personally it’s not. I like making her feel good, my main goal is to make her feel as great as possible during just like hers is to make me feel the same. 

Is it better with a girl you have feelings for? I’d say yes but I’d say that about literally all things sexual, they’re fun no matter what but I’d trade all my hookups for another month with the only girl I’ve actually cared about.

Always like it or just with right partner? Always good waaaaaay better with a partner you care about.

When actual female friends did it to me it depended how clearly invested they were before telling me (if I thought it was pretty clear before they told me and I’d non verbally shut that stuff down already) then it took longer with me normally stepping away for a while because they clearly didn’t get the hint before hand so I just wanted some desperation for a while. 

If it was somebody that I thought was less invested (didn’t have a clue before they told me and they just said something like “I like you can we get a drink sometime” rather than a big declaration) then like a week or two. 

The only one that has been a big issue has been this friend of mine who isn’t platonic, we’re platonish? Platonic adjacent? I dunno how to best describe it. We started out by hooking up, became friends. Stopped hooking up for a while, went back to fwb, after like 8 months of sleeping together she said she was feeling *insert long speech* I said I wasn’t ready for a commitment at the time (was going through a fair amount at the time and wasn’t used to actually feeling something for a girl I’m sleeping with, she was and is the only girl I’ve felt anything real for out of all the girls I’ve been with). We stopped talking for a few months, started again recently, we still click stupidly well and I now feel everything she did, she just started dating somebody else though. It started out being slightly awkward because I told her before I knew she was dating somebody. We got over that pretty quick (like a week). But the problem now is we accidentally slip into flirting with each other too easily due to our past and chemistry so we’re in this weird position where we’ll talk for a few hours it will go slightly too far we’ll call it out the next morning and say “let’s not talk for a few days” then either she’ll text me the next day or I’ll text her. (I’d feel bad if I was the one initiating and do a bit anyway but since it’s not intentional and she’s equally to blame I don’t feel awful about it). 

TLDR wasn’t really normal before, hasn’t gone back to a normal level ever. 

Tbh I’m just surprised her current guy hasn’t moved on they’ve only been together a few weeks, she’s great and really hot but still personally I’d take still talks to (effectively) an ex daily, an ex who has expressed romantic interest at that (admittedly before I knew they were dating) as a serious red flag and get the fuck out of that."

AskMen,ff2q3z8,t3_erbrw0,1579518846.0,Right who is actually going to care if they’re told this by their gf. Random girl says that kinda weird but your gf? What would you rather them do? Think of some other guy? Wtf
wholesomememes,ff1yq52,t3_er27i7,1579489262.0,Gotta love parents telling kids to shut up all the time then wondering why their kids don’t want to talk to them ever when they grow up
memes,fex7xpu,t3_eqthyh,1579426501.0,The only real exception to this is when it’s your girlfriend and you live a few hours apart so you only get to see them properly at the weekend. Anybody other than that is a psychopath who plans to murder you.
AskMen,fewzu6l,t3_eqj1ne,1579422035.0,Jesus Christ why wouldn’t you text first stop playing fucking games if you like somebody talk to them. I can tell you girls that actively messaged me first got way more attention from me than ones that waited for me to message them first. Personally (and I’m sure plenty of other guys agree) I take not texting me first as a sign you’re not that interested so that might explain the one word responses a fair amount
AskMen,fewyjxk,t3_eqjdpl,1579421462.0,So far it hasn’t really ever happened. Once it did because the condom was a really shit quality one (it was just one of those super safe thicker ones which super limits sensation) but we just got a different one out the testing pack we were trying out and went back to it without a problem. If you’re having problems maybe try a different one?
AskMen,fewxvkw,t3_eqjj21,1579421175.0,"You said you’re earning 250 now and don’t know how to dress, mate time to start buying bespoke if you’re willing to spend a few grand on a suit (normally 3-5) and start having things like shirts etc tailored properly (if you’re not willing to pay the extra for bespoke then get suits tailored properly). Looking the part is a big % of it. Other than that honestly you will just learn through exposure but you could look at YouTube or get a etiquette course if it really bothers you."
AskMen,fewwwjn,t3_eqkama,1579420749.0,"Find out together. I’d want to know the moment she suspects it, if she is that’s life changing for both of you."
AskMen,feww4p5,t1_fetc6sz,1579420411.0,Well she’s a cunt
