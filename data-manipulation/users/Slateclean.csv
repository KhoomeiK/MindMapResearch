He said when the conditions and visibility suit, which means excluding blind corners.  I just don’t think you’re getting it."

videos,ffsgcdo,t1_ffqubxl,1580181033.0,"Ever been in a proper whiteout at the snow or something?  Flying in one is wildly confusing since you cant trust what you feel - theres no visual reference points to re-sync your body to align when you feel a force that its a downward one - you have to use the instruments but vfr is heavy on looking-out as much as possible which is at odds with this.  If not for instruments, in cloud you can be in a dive but not feel or see it, nor when you’re rolling over etc - it may feel like you’re hovering but you’re actually rolling sideways but thrust makes it feel like down is down.

Technically, infinite cloud, you could get away with looping a 747 and have the passengers believe the g-force changes were just ‘turbulence’"

Is it autistic to use that as what seems to be an implied insult on a sub full of people likely on the spectrum?

I dont think this tool can be explained adequately for someone with the attention span of a goldfish - but i think someone using such an attention span can understand it within that time just by trying it.   The experience is much clearer than any explanation in words would do justice to.  Its like trying to explain snow to someone thats never seen it when its right outside so they could just step out."
