peloton,ffjwvwh,t3_etlket,1580009173.0,Ok here we go. They pulled back 35 seconds pretty quick.
peloton,ffjw5rc,t3_etlket,1580008592.0,"Finally getting to watch live cycling! Have missed all the stages so far. 

Also how late is the peloton going to wait to try to reel in the break?

Edit: they're really going to have to blaze it up wilunga  (sp?) to pull back enough time...I think. I'm not quite clear on GC time differences."

peloton,fen046r,t1_femy8he,1579273966.0,"Oh, I didn't mean to make the bag itself light. I meant to suggest I'd be happy having less things to carry in my backpack. Some days it can get quite heavy and my back would prefer a lighter load (especially the day or two after a bouldering session).

Lately I've just been in a mood to learn how to make/fix more things myself. Getting a framebag or handlebar bag would only be about half of the benefit. Learning how to make something functional from scratch would be the main goal."
peloton,femxt24,t3_epx1wi,1579272382.0,"The whole office thinks I'm absolutely nuts for still cycling in to work. This week I've managed to bike 4 days - every single day I've had to come into the office. Today's AM temperature was actually frighteningly low (and I don't have full face coverage so my cheeks got quite the sting on the ride), but there's no snow or ice on the ground at all so it was a very smooth ride in with a slight tail/cross wind.

I seem to have decided - against all sense - that I'm not busy enough and have been toying with the idea of learning how to make some gear for my bike - frame bag, handlebar bag, etc - in case I decide I want my backpack to be lighter. This may be one of my sillier ideas."

Fantasy,fedzth8,t1_fedxj42,1579023355.0,"I had only read Mirror Empire and Empire Ascendant years ago, when they first came out. Then I read The Stars Are Legion and The Light Brigade back to back in December. They were so good in wildly different ways. Then I checked in on the status of The Broken Heavens (the 3rd book in the Worldbreaker saga) and realized it was coming out soon, so I dug up my copies of the first two books to reread them. It's been really hard to do anything other than keep reading Mirror Empire."
Fantasy,fedrtlu,t3_eomxz9,1579018525.0,"Kameron Hurley's Worldbreaker Saga is great. I'm just re-reading the first two books right now, since the final book is out now and it's been a few years since Book 2. It's a nice reminder of how wild that world is. 

I also have a soft spot for C. S. Friedman's Coldfire Trilogy. Really interesting and dark world."

edit: can't believe i forgot a word"
peloton,fdrjpnb,t1_fdr3pp3,1578685494.0,"The main reason was that I didn't initially have anyone to climb with. Top rope climbing in most places requires a partner (unless the gym has an auto-belay system). I started out with bouldering because I was on my own, and stuck with it because I liked the isolation and quietly puzzling things out myself. There are some folks at my gym that I'm friendly with but no one I know by name and I can be fairly shy in person, so I haven't really put myself out there as someone to go top rope climbing with. I stuck with bouldering because it's just been a lot of fun and the gym that's closest to me is almost exclusively set up for it. I'm not able to get out often enough to climb to get bored of my gym's routes (they switch up the walls fairly regularly) so the one gym has enough variety for me at the moment.

edit: misread your question, so I rewrote my answer"
peloton,fdqtaem,t3_emhrv4,1578674412.0,"I'm happy to still be able to bike to work. The weather's been yo-yoing a bit in terms of temperature, but none of the snow we've gotten has been able to stick on the ground, so I've been able to bundle up and hop on the bike. I usually stop when there's a consistent layer of snow/slush that makes it too dangerous to mix it up with car traffic, tram tracks, etc. So far that hasn't happened. Tough part is that drivers seem to not really be expecting cyclists on the road as much this far into winter, but the forecast looks like I'll be able to go into next week at least so they'll be seeing me a bit longer at least.

It's my first season watching cross races and they're lots of fun. I've clearly been missing out. (Did you guys know that this Van Der Poel kid is also really good at cross? /s)"
peloton,fdqr2sx,t1_fdq5pfn,1578673060.0,"I have a good flat cycle path as part of my commute and I've managed to keep pace with some of the ebike folk, which I'm pretty happy about. They're great for drafting when there are headwinds too.

peloton,fdqqclw,t1_fdq995z,1578672613.0," A handful of years ago I picked up indoor rock climbing (specifically the bouldering discipline). I do that once or twice a week now and it's great for core, back, shoulder, arm and leg strength and way more fun than just doing weights/rubber bands. Also forces you to do a lot more types of leg movements than you would otherwise do if you just stuck with cycling as your main form of exercise. Having said that, you have to be in a relatively big town/city for there to be a climbing gym, and it's not something that can always be found in every city."
