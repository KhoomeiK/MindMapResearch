AskReddit,fexv4ry,t1_fexa0p7,1579437045.0,"In my very first school they had macintosh computers, tons of oregon trail. Switched to another school as that one was being demolished, and don't remember them having computers at all, but they did have reckless disregard for what we got up to during recess, so just replaced that with absolutely demolishing eachother in ""wall-ball"". Then I transferred yet again, and the excuse to demolish eachother there was ""tennis soccer"", basically just soccer with a tennis ball. After that though, I transferred to an entirely new school district and school 4 hours away, and one of their classes was based on learning how to type. I finished the program within the first week(I don't remember how long it actually was but I finished well before the half way point that they expected it to take) and just dicked around, only to find one day that my progress was all reset. Teacher had the audacity to tell me to just do it again then, and acted like I didn't complete it even though I already showed everyone my completion status and such. One of my first memories of being absolutely pissed and filled with rebellion and it was grade 6.  


Anyways, I ended up just bringing Doom on a floppy disk and ""installing""(there was no installing back then) it onto the shared drive for the school and just playing that instead, giving others the directions to play it, and afterwards having everyone do multiplayer matches with me. Computers were WILD at the beginning."

I was like 7. Ended up being a ""you can't use the computer without supervision"" situation until my grandma once again downloaded trash until it went into that restart cycle(not entirely true, the virus was probably already on it when I was just uninstalling the bloat) and she couldn't blame me for it.

Finding where the decline of TV in general started is something I'm not at all interested, but I think MTV was the first to start reality TV(whether it would've happened regardless or not), and the rise of reality tv definitely had an effect on such classic mains as Discovery TV(specifically, how it's made, and well made informative documentaries) and G4/Tech TV(but that was mostly a corporate failure, at least it lasted long enough to gift us with CodeMonkeys)."

Then I switched to PC, and now being a mage is feasible, so I just got bored of playing a necromancer due to mixing up the two mods and it being a little annoying. And started anew, as a nord brawler(specifically aiming towards a two handed axe or hammer) with really no focus on the storyline and just wanting to kill the empire(serves them right for trying to execute me).

The next three hours involved him building a lovely mountain resort sort of house, while I just built my way towards him in a super high sky walkway.  The timing worked out great though,  because just as he finished I finally made it over top and destroyed his base(the only thing I found before starting the skywalk was TNT, the cards clearly played himself). He was outside and going into the mine when I dropped the first one, and then promptly fell off. I missed, but played it chill, and actually spawned nearby. He was deep into mining at that point, and I grabbed my remaining TNT, and naturally placed it far more strategically. He was coming back when it went off, and I just broke out laughing my ass off, to his confusion. Soon as he saw I destroyed his house though, he immediately shut off the (I think it was 360) and ragequit. We never played again. It was a great minecraft experience."

gaming,fet7f1h,t1_fet3i57,1579372463.0,"I have lost the desire to game largely, but have what I need to do so. Have lots of media to soak up instead, which basically makes me a bookworm. Taught more than a few friends how to play league though, and with the drunken shit talking still getting honored thing, that was back when the enemy could honor you too, and I did it consistently. We lived together and I remember yelling at him ""I'm definitely getting banned for this"" while saying insulting shit and at the end of the game making him come look at my 8 honors(he didn't honor me, one left instantly).  
Cussing someone out isn't the joy of gaming, it's talking shit with absolutely no backing or ground to say it on. It's the ""gg easy"" after going 2-12 and your team winning for you, it's the ""not in a million years"" after living with 3 hp, it's the ""worth"" after dying for a ward, there's no anger in it."

gaming,fet5kof,t1_fese1yr,1579372030.0,"My first tag was SmilingGrenade, but all other pseudonyms have included three words like the one I have now. I never bothered adding anyone but used to accept most invites back in the 360 days, when I shifted to PS4 I block people, and ignore invites and usually only have one person out of a group that I've personally accepted or added, sometimes two. The one I initially got into the group with is almost always a lifelong friend though, the rest are just sidecharacters. Hell, I didn't turn on my ps4 for over a year and a dude I met from Fortnite(back when it was already getting trash) immediately reconnected with me. I'm great at being a bad friend."

My comment was more about you investing into GTA online emotionally when it seems so meek as far as online gameplay goes."

His second account wasn't set up in the settings to allow offline play, and his internet which is already shit and doesn't allow him to play online was down so he couldn't switch that little setting unless he went online, when he did every game forced a download. We did not get to game it together. Fuck xbone."
