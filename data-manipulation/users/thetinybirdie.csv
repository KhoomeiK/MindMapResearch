Either way....I love his response. Lol. Who asks about height anymore?"
Tinder,fcpgpeb,t1_fcpao8t,1577863245.0,"I noticed this too. I am going into the business world (specifically accounting), and know people will have a hard time taking me seriously. 

It's also probably because I am the height of a 10 year old (maybe, depends on the kid). Due note I am 4'10. (4'9 ½ technically)."

But I understand where OP is coming from. I will probably get downvoted...but here is why I think that. 

I understand where she is coming from because I have been in that position. She mentions how she tried to placate the situation and move the conversation away from her lack if sex life. She even mentioned how her friend kept ""joking"" about OPs lack of a sex life in front of her friends, they were not OPS friends, at the discomfort of OP. She mentions how her friend did not listen and she spoke out in anger. Yes, I get that it was uncalled for, but if they would have listened to OP I do not think she would have said that. 

I have also learned that people like OP's friend arent actually friends."
