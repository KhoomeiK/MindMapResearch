Hindsight is a wonderful tool to look at a whole story and make a judgement based on how it ended, but each situation bar the very last is just another day in Shadowrun. 

 A player kidnapped an npc? That's standard fare for Shadowrun. One of my very favourite stories involved a kidnapping, same players no less. 

When he caused a chase? That is also standard fare for shadowrun. This one had a smaller death toll than most chases. 

When he confronted the cops? Also standard fare. In fact the only thing more standard really is 'Runner confronts gang banger' 

In fact, suicide by cop isn't all that uncommon either in the game. There's even lore characters that have done it. 

Just say ""no"".... How much player autonomy are you prepared to sacrifice for something that hasn't happened yet?

That's a fair interpretation. However it hinges on the notion of the GM not as a neutral arbiter of actions and consequences but as an active moral component of the game. 

In Shadowrun I always make it clear in session zero that the only limitation I'm going to place on actions is A, can you do it according to your stats /skills/gear and B, are you prepared to deal with the consequences.

Jack had done no particular wrong. I'm not going to spin you a tale of how he had done scummy things to deserve it or anything like that. It's just not true, at worst he made the mistake of giving his fellow criminals, thieves and murderers too much access. Sometimes that's enough. 

>Sometime ""He can logically do it"" is not a good enough justification for allowing your players to do something.

I am prepared to disagree on this point. Player autonomy within a game world is absolutely essential in my view, and that does include the right to do stupid things. My job as GM is to enact consequences from the world for their choices, not to arbitrarily tell them they can't do a thing that they have the skills and willingness to do.

He has spent decades as an *independent* unless he's running for president. He's filed senatorial paperwork if he loses to run as an *independent*

See, I can do that too. Until you can refute that latter point, you aren't going to change my view.

Incidentally, I'm not the OP, nor an American, so I'm not sure why you're trying so hard, but I appreciate the effort."
changemyview,ff9k22c,t1_ff9bbyu,1579714664.0,">So no, you're flat out wrong. Bernie is a Democrat. And a far better one than those like Manchin.

He's far closer to their ideals, sure, but he's been an independent for decades except when running as president. He may embody their virtues, but he doesn't wear the team jacket."
changemyview,ff9jycy,t1_ff9ju4o,1579714603.0,"They only asked her about Sanders, the media would have immediately posted 'Clinton endorses Sanders' everywhere. She'd be smart to say nothing at all until the primary is over, but she likes to meddle too much for that."
changemyview,ff9ju4x,t1_ff9bgzn,1579714532.0,">Gotta love the gatekeeping though. There's no rule that says you must've always been a Democrat to be considered one now.

Clinton was the one who singled out lack of party loyalty as something she was personally affronted by in her book on the 2016 election. I don't care either way."
changemyview,ff9jp95,t1_ff9izev,1579714451.0,">Primary education should include teaching children how to think critically. I also believe that anything pretending to be news should be held accountable for reporting facts.

Fully agree"
changemyview,ff9jmmy,t1_ff9jfcx,1579714408.0,">And the job of a politician is to represent his constituents and support legislation that benefits the greater good, not to kowtow to a hayride, toe lines or hew to labels. 

I agree, according to her own book, Clinton values party loyalty. 

>Once the political label of 'Democrat' takes precedence over the political orientation of 'leftist' or the conscience and negotiated will of a politician seeking to serve the public, it not only ceases to be useful, but becomes actively pernicious to itself.

Couldn't agree more."
changemyview,ff9jizm,t1_ff9jf1t,1579714348.0,">So, uh, he is a Democrat

In name only, yes. I'm glad we agree.

You can stop any time you want."

changemyview,ff9jcoi,t1_ff9j5bo,1579714244.0,">If he wins and becomes president he will go down in history with a D next to his name, not an I. Saying he's an independent in the Senate is irrelevant.

I agree with you. According to her book, Clinton does not. She was in fact quite affronted at his continuing independence rather than putting that D there permanently."
changemyview,ff9j8ko,t1_ff9j2vj,1579714174.0,"And if I link to his filed paperwork to run as an independent Senator? Assuming such things are publicly available?

He's only ever going to officially be a Democrat when he has to be."

True, but that's not on the plate on the DNC party hq I'm afraid.

>I know the point of your comment was to highlight that Bernie and Clinton are technically members of two separate parties but to say Hillary is a democrat and Bernie isn’t seems like a misrepresentation.

That's a fair point, and a correct view of what I was going for. Regardless of who better embodies the ideal, at the moment Clinton is officially the Democratic party member and Sanders is officially the Independent."
changemyview,ff9ix8v,t1_ff9it1g,1579713987.0,">I’d like to also point out that modern day democrats reflect more politically conservative center, dare I say a tad bit rightish?

True. I think they're called blue dog Democrats, or at least I've heard them called that. I have no idea what it means though."
changemyview,ff9iu1j,t1_ff9io1s,1579713934.0,">Someone literally just posted that Bernie signed the Democrat pledge 

And I literally just posted that he filed paperwork to run as an independent Senator if he doesn't become president. Why does your bit of signed paper weigh heavier than mine.

Bernie has been an independent for decades at, all times unless he's running for president."

Yup, they're doing a terrible job in fact, or Bernie wouldn't be so popular."
