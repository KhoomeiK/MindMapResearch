People don't know that. They'll just follow the part of their religion that's more convenient to them. To many people, religion is something they can use to justify their hate for what's different. Many religious people I know didn't read the messages of love and forgiveness in the Bible. As a matter of fact, the most religious people I know can't even read. That's how unaware they are of what they're doing. Ironically, those were Jesus' last words.
