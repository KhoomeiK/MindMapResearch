TalesFromYourServer,fdxdpto,t3_en92pm,1578767707.0,"There was very little that pissed me off more than being snapped at. I developed this strategy to keep myself feeling human: 1. Customer snaps at me. 2. Quick spin to face customer with both hands snapping then morphing into finger guns with a huge obviously fake smile. 3. Abandon customer for mandatory “time out”. Once, this prompted a customer to follow me to the “server alley” (where the POSs, drinks, ice machines, etc. were). They reached out to grab my arm and I said “I swear to Christ if you touch me I’ll end your damn life”. Quiet lunch crowd; whole restaurant goes quiet. I looked up into the guy’s eyes, smiled, and said “I’ll be with you momentarily” and let the smile die. Stared him down till he walked back to his table. I don’t think I’m Billy Badass, but momma didn’t raise me to be shit on."
