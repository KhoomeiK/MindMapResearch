videos,fenodtj,t1_fennhgn,1579288516.0,"By using it correctly. I mean i can't change the word all by myself. All i can do is use it without the connotation and hope it catches on. Could it be that this is a common misunderstanding? What on side sees as pretending ignorance, the other side sees as trying to work past it?"
videos,fenmrz4,t1_fenm6yj,1579288009.0,I'm not pretending anything. I understand perfectly. But how do we get rid of the connotations behind the word if not by forcing it out?
videos,fenm1mq,t1_fenlids,1579287576.0,I don't know I just really hate the feeding frenzies that happen when somebody says and oopsie. Everybody sees the opportunity to get a quick hit in and somehow feel morally superior about it. I'll be the punching bag all day as long as i get to hold a mirror up to those self righteous morons. All they can do is take away my internet points. Notice i dont down vote these people. I value discourse.

videos,feniwxy,t1_fenhx7u,1579285670.0,"See, you're still doing it. ""Sure"" what? I didn't ask you a yes or no question. You know I'm not trying to enlighten you. You're having fun with this because you think you have the moral high ground. Doesn't that make you kinda sick when you think about it? Instead of trying to explain to me why my thinking is incorrect, you would rather scoff triumphantly with other guy over here? By the way, yes I understand where, from a different perspective, what I said could be viewed as trying to ignore racism. I get that. I only acted contrarian to asshole comments you who wanted to respond with insults. I think thats it."
videos,fenhyl5,t1_fengxr1,1579285084.0,"Ok do you not see how that comment is a reply to a guy saying ""people like you are the fucking worst"" and saying im not ""bout that life""? It was an idiotic comment. But yea jump on the bandwagon if it makes you feel better. Obviously this is not about building understanding"
videos,fenh3py,t1_fencpzd,1579284554.0,You two are so self congratulatory and off the mark its nausiating. This is exactly why its so difficult to build understanding because people like you see an opportunity to just dump on whoever is currently being pointed at just to make yourself feel superior. You dont want to improve anything. You only enjoy seeing and participating in attacking people.
videos,fenco2e,t1_fen9mba,1579281849.0,I'm not perfect and everybody has blind spots. Maybe I'm behind the curve I dunno. But i don't take my ideas from cartoons. And I don't watch either religiously. Especially south park.

Uh huh. You're a real winner dude. Maybe you aren't the full authority on what constitutes cruelty and what doesn't? If you're comparing a kid riding a horse to child labor then I think you're viewpoint is a little skewed. If this I a problem for you then go protest a dog show or a rodeo. You won't. Because its fucking silly."
pics,fdhmjui,t1_fdhl8ct,1578425818.0,"Its no more cruel than putting a sweater on a dog and its not absurd to let a little boy pretend for a little while before he has to go back to facing brain surgery. You're an asshole, plain and simple. Get off your soapbox. No harm is being done here and you know it. Horses have been used for transportation for centuries. This is literally a stroll in some shade. He probably got extra carrots for it. You really have some serious attention seeking issues if you're willing to steal it from a sick kid. Get a life dude."
