antiwork,ffjy5nu,t3_eu1ezt,1580010181.0,"This shit is right on par with rating yourself in your annual review. Who's gonna put below? Nah...i don't like raises. But on the flipside, giving  youself a top score requires 50 pages of examples."
AskReddit,ffjxug6,t3_etts4s,1580009936.0,Dying hurts.
AskReddit,ffjxsim,t3_ett7fr,1580009894.0,Dude....where to even begin.
antiwork,ffjwjm4,t3_esxtps,1580008896.0,I think and feel exactly the same way. I've been trying to console myself by remembering I only have 27 years until retirement. It's not working.
antiwork,ffjw2m3,t3_eu183r,1580008526.0,50k as a software developer? You're getting hosed.
antiwork,ffjvd3v,t3_et7cpz,1580007981.0,"Can you type ""negotiable"" in that field? If so, just put that."
antiwork,ffjuoil,t1_ffjhi4m,1580007444.0,I think leaving a small balance actually helps more. Like $10. I could be wrong though.
antiwork,ffjubm0,t3_eu0ueg,1580007156.0,"There isn't a point unless it's a job requiring micromanagement. All they do is meet, talk and dole out work. A ticket dispenser could do the same."
antiwork,ffjq9de,t3_etwlii,1580004202.0,"Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. He's gettin it from doin company crime."
antiwork,ffjpjcm,t3_ets0ci,1580003722.0,Machines are replacing jobs in every area. The only things that will be of value for humans soon is full-on brain work. I got hired as an accounts receivable associate and all they want me to do is projects and shit that isn't my job.
antiwork,ffjnf7r,t3_etmlhs,1580002290.0,"Plan your exit strategy. Joe lazy bum could do zero work and he would be safer than the person who complained. In corporate America, justified complaints put a target on your back.

Edit: assuming you are in the states."
antiwork,ffjn3xo,t3_etptln,1580002077.0,Mini-calendar of tropical places I'm not at. Every year.
antiwork,ffjmsxd,t1_ffjmctk,1580001873.0,You too my socialist friend.
antiwork,ffjmorb,t1_ffjmhil,1580001792.0,That and keeping our bosses employed. What purpose do they serve if they have nobody to manage? Pretty sure I'm forced to be there so my manager has a job.
antiwork,ffjm7l7,t1_ffjly58,1580001471.0,"Lol...clicking on excel sheets, you hit the nail on the head. Why does that have to be done at the office?"
antiwork,ffjm2l0,t3_etydac,1580001376.0,"When I worked customer service call center, my supervisor did the same to me. I looked her in the eye and said ""I am using the bathroom."" The way I said it....she realized how assinine she was being."
antiwork,ffjlhla,t1_ffjl9cb,1580000983.0,"Same. 40 hours a week is an understatement. Add in the 2 hours getting ready in the morning (female so it takes longer), the 30 min commute each way and it's a 52.5 hour work week."
antiwork,ffjkqsw,t1_ffjkcmy,1580000468.0,"Honestly, I'd rather work more if I can do it at home. Let me work from home and I'll give you more of my life. Sad trade for me but I hate the office."
antiwork,ffjkkzc,t1_ffihbxk,1580000358.0,"I have the same issues as you. I'm 40 and have been working since 15 and a half. Been looking my whole working life for what you're talking about and found you only get that flexibility after putting in time with the company. If you can get a job that gives you a laptop, do the time and gradually get yourself regular work from home days. Sorry if this isn't what you're looking for but it's the best I've found so far."
antiwork,ffjk1k4,t3_etuc45,1579999991.0,Basically everything you just listed.
antiwork,ffjju35,t1_ffjip80,1579999856.0,Maslow and his hierarchy of needs is right on but you shouldn't have to live in a rat race hampster wheel just to have the bottom of his pyramid.
antiwork,ffjia0i,t3_etc66r,1579998821.0,I completely understand and feel the exact same way. You are not alone.
antiwork,ffji1vk,t3_er0s2v,1579998668.0,It's even worse when you have a company laptop and can easily do your job from home but have to come in for no logical reason at all. It's like I'm being forced to be there in person so higher-ups have a job.....watching me. Glad I could keep you employed asshole.
antiwork,ffjhp3u,t3_estl9d,1579998458.0,This was bittersweet to read.
antiwork,ffjhgkb,t3_esrj3q,1579998317.0,"This is why I don't friend co-workers on social media. If they ask to do so, I say I'm not on there."
antiwork,ffjh1f5,t1_ffhtel5,1579998067.0,3 cents just fell from the sky.
depression,ffgktzq,t1_feypy3g,1579908546.0,Of course. You are not alone in this my friend. :)
AskReddit,fewa9rn,t1_f74o3we,1579407474.0,You make a good point and I get what you're saying. I didn't explain myself enough. I was only referring to greasy older douchey dudes that prey on ignorant young girls that don't want it.
depression,few8iv6,t1_fd7w6kq,1579406897.0,"Wasn't sure how to reply. I get it. I really do. I'm sorry you gotta go through this. While my reply doesn't help, the intention was to say that nobodies will. Only you can change how you think. I'm dealing with it too and it's fricken hard."
socialanxiety,few7c4c,t1_f09lllj,1579406381.0,Hey! How's it going so far? Just wanted to pop in and check. :)
cats,few5mei,t1_fepq09a,1579405743.0,For sure they do. Spoiled rotten and totally know they can pretty much get away with anything. :P
AskReddit,few16ax,t3_eqies2,1579404002.0,"I had a forever diamond necklace I got from my mom that I wore everyday for years. I always took it off before showering. I was in the bathroom taking my necklace off and the diamond charm piece slid off the chain and flew off. I didn't hear it land on anything. It just vanished. My bathroom at the time was a small, one bedroom apartment bathroom and I searched it on my hangs and knees. I never found it. The sink drain is the obvious culprit but the drain top was pushed down so far it couldn't of slid in there. I suspect one of the folks like those here talking about magic coins appearing out of nowhere is wearing it now."
cats,feoxzeq,t1_feoxsx0,1579307825.0,Thanks! He is quite the derp.
aww,feoryho,t1_feor9vh,1579304623.0,Ours are both boys too. Brothers from the same litter. They either love each other or hate.
depression,fd6471q,t3_ek1ll9,1578185292.0,What you said is only in your own mind. It's not real. You can't fix this until you figure out how to get out of your own brains lies.
depression,fd62j5s,t1_fd1uwif,1578184661.0,Mental illness is the worst affliction. You can't really prove it...it's not like a broken bone or cancer but it's worse in so many ways. It won't kill you. It'll just torture you until you kill yourself or exist in a life of misery.
pics,fd5utf4,t1_fd4xma7,1578181768.0,Simple-minded is the perfect way to describe him in this version. Joker is insane but he's not stupid. They missed the mark in that aspect.
cocaine,fcohh05,t1_fcd671z,1577832330.0,Fentanyl is extremely deadly in even a small dose. It's usually mixed in heroin but cross contamination can happen.
cocaine,fcc822e,t3_egw8aw,1577595439.0,Girl I knew from junior high school just died a month ago from coke laced with fentanyl. It was just a bad batch and she happened to get it. Her friend doing it with her died too.
