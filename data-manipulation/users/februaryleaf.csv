changemyview,ffhei9a,t3_et6j3l,1579931949.0,"“Fulfilling” implies there is some purpose being fulfilled.  “Meaningful” also implies purpose.  Gandhi and MLK’s lives would have been fulfilling and meaningful with or without spouses.  The woman that never gets married but spends all her time helping troubled youth probably felt her life was fulfilling.  The man that spent his time rehabbing criminals and getting them back on their feet probably found his life fulfilling.

I think too many of us don’t think enough about what we want our purpose to be.  With religion falling out of favor it is more important than ever!  Instead, our purpose is populated by the culture, religion, and upbringing of our youth.  We were taught our purpose is to enjoy this life, find love, and raise children.

That doesn’t have to be your purpose and, if you can find out what your purpose is, then you may even be better off than many people in strong relationships.  That being said finding a purpose is not easy and living that purpose can be extremely difficult and may never allow for trips to see the sunset.

However, I disagree that a long term partner is necessary for meaning and fulfillment."

changemyview,ffhcb66,t1_ffgg36d,1579929668.0,"Both are frighteningly expensive.  Adoption costs vary by state but can easily be over $20K.  I agree with your point though.  If bringing children into the world is unethical it should be universally applied.

Also, adoption takes years and may never go through.  Even when it does there are usually (very reasonable) laws around birth parent rights that give them up to a week (or more) to change their mind.  Although this is pretty rare it can be very scary to potential adopters.  Furthermore, there can be complications like mixed race adoptions and the fact that many adopted children did not receive great prenatal care.

Even furthermore is the fact that the US does NOT have a surplus of free and legal infant adoptions (that is why the waiting time is so long).  There are more parents wanting to adopt than there are children being put up for adoption.

If you really want to make a difference you probably ought to be doing foster care.  Foster care is an extremely fraught experience and it is potentially unethical to enter foster care with the intent to adopt (the legal system is designed so the primary goal is usually reunification).
