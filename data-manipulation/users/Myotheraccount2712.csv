dpdr,feivvi2,t3_epdck7,1579148629.0,"Gosh I wanted to write something like this but you wrote it for me. Im not sure about you, but I turned 22 end of last month and i think about my whole life and its all been a confusing blur. Ive never been able to retain information, even as simple as learning weight lifting moves at the gym (I tried but it gets so confusing and my actions dont feel like my own) and then its hard to remember and redo the move because my memory is blank. Know you are not alone. Lately its been better because Ive realized something lately that my ocd might be making this ""disorder"".. Youre constantly in your head and thinking about it and too aware of your ""window"".. (the minds window youre watching the world through everyone talks about).. something that helped me is to connect my actions with my thoughts by doing actions with my eyes closed (taking a shower with my eyes closed and feel the soap bottle.. visualize your surroundings while performing action. etc)..

StackAdvice,fdn4lik,t3_em0btc,1578577117.0,"For inflammation and brain fog, look into fasting and its history. Theres r/fasting and would highly recommend r/snakediet and its youtube channel for info and motivation. Cole robinson is very knowledgeable. Dont depend on supplements too much or at all, i realized myself with most nootropics theyre only putting a bandaid over a wound. Most supplements are a scam. Also look at Carol Dwecks ted  talks video ""The power of yet"" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J-swZaKN2Ic"
