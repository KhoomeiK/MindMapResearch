EruditeClub,femep8l,t3_epwzx3,1579251609.0,"I'm reading the Geometry one now, mostly because I came across it. I  had Geometry in high school and enjoyed it. When I came across the book,  I   thought I'd read it to to refresh my memory. The book is very, very easy to follow and provides a simplistic view of the subject. 

IIRC the book states that it is designed to introduce elementary school teachers to Geometry. This sounds about right.

I did find a simple error in one of the side bars that was driving me nuts until I verified that it was incorrect with my mathematician brother."

science,fdm7ztr,t1_fdm5kyf,1578542057.0,"I thought with income based repayment plans you pay a certain percentage of your income for twenty (?) years. After twenty years (I Think that's the length of time) your left over loan is forgiven but you owe taxes on the amount that you didn't pay. In other to avoid a big tax surprise, you are supposed to put enough money each month into a savings account to be able to pay the taxes that will be owed.  Between the smaller payment and the taxes, you still pay less each month than on other student loan payment methods.

Note that I am not an accountant."

EruditeClub,fcjdmkm,t3_ehhka3,1577683958.0,"I've been and still am regularly active in a number of physical activities for my entire life. In my late 40's I started karate because I felt I needed to get more flexible. It helped,  increased my flexibility a bit. Still, after more than a decade of karate I decided that my lack of flexibility was starting to impact my daily life so,  with reluctance, I started twice weekly beginner yoga classes.  In less than a month I noticed a life changing increase in my flexibility. Simple things like being able to check my blind spot when I'm driving.

For most of life I thought I hated yoga and then I realize I had NEVER tried yoga. There's probably a metaphor for life in there.

After three years of yoga, I still don't love yoga but I don't hate it either. I get so much benefit from it that I keep going."
