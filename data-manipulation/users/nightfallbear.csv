depression,fcrcog6,t3_eieavt,1577900048.0,depresses me every year. I've never had a new year's kiss at midnight. Always alone. I never even try to celebrate anymore. that really goes for every holiday. they're just normal days for me. time marches on. I'm alone. I'll be dead someday. hopefully that day comes sooner rather than later.

I'm a 43 year old gay man and I have a non-traditional body type that no one seems to be into. on top of that, I am pretty socially phobic and shy so I have trouble meeting people. and yeah, I get touch hunger a lot. don't really have any friends. haven't had a date in over 15 years. I haven't even gotten a hug in over a month. and...uhm, I don't know how I deal with it. I get depressed a lot. really anxious. I cry and I think about dying a lot. I dunno how to deal with it. I'm in therapy but it doesn't teach me how to ask someone to hug and cuddle me."
