firstimpression,fffvqty,t1_fffuqpj,1579892853.0,Athe makeup adds to that. I’m short and petite and want to be taken seriously… Especially when I’m lifting/ at the gym. So I use angular make up techniques to give myself a slightly sharper face. Bitch is not what I’m going for but I don’t want to look like a sweet pea either :/
