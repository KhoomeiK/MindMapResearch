todayilearned,fcjyihg,t1_fcjuyw7,1577710573.0,"It's true that coca cola has gained massive brand awareness but there are competitors out there, trying to get their profit. Sure, coke doesn't need constant advertisement, and they could go a long time without it. But even they are not immune to the competition. If no one would ever buy anything rather than coke, competitors wouldn't have a chance and coke wouldn't need too much advertisement. But since there are many other products out there, coke has to prove time and again that they are the best choice."
todayilearned,fcjy82z,t1_fcjtz6j,1577710233.0,"First of all, products have tiers. Cheap, one-time use products that have no emotional weight to them are on the low commitment and low thought tier. Coca cola is one of those. You don't have to go with a small segment target audience. You can advertise to anyone and everyone and you will probably succeed. Coca cola's goal is to stay the number one fizzy brand. With the goal and target audience (or lack of) in mind, they make their advertisement campaigns. Pepsi also can go for the same audience, as they are on the same tier as coke. But they are also threatened by coke and hurt by them. Their goal is a bit different, they want to prove they are better. That's why they would go with campaigns that would prove they are better, with a more direct message (not just 'enjoy life' like coke) and might even try to 'threaten' coke (like their tweet with the coke can wearing a Pepsi cape and the writing 'everybody has a hero). Avis does it too - ""we try harder""

With iPhones it's a different story completely. They are on a higher tier. Their product is of high commitment - if you choose a product that doesn't fit you you are stuck with it and won't easily replace it, as it would cost you a fortune.

iPhones are harder to sell, and bad advertisement would cost apple a lot. They need to focus on a smaller segment in the market. They go for younger, more technophile audience. They go with a sophisticated but minimal design, they tell you how much better their product is, and it's worth the price. Sure, some people would never use their product, even if it was offered for free (it also relates to the high commitment point I mentioned). They go for people who are either more flexible on their phone choice or even people who already have iPhones. People would not buy the product if it was not advertised constantly. (Of course too much advertisement can harm your brand, low quality advertisement could also do that. That's why you need to advertise smarter). People are fans thanks to brand awareness and brand awareness is not made by customers, but by advertisers"

Also there's something called web of associations (maybe it has another name, it's just a freestyle translation from my language). It's when you want your product to be associated with certain things and people. With the WoF example I guess they want the dresses to be associated with the woman (forgot her name) who wore the dress, the term ""fortune"", luxury...

Some marketeers also use it for disassociation. For example with margarine - it's unhealthy, associated with heart diseases, not natural... Marketeers show baked goods on the packaging so you will associate it with baking rather than the unhealthy effects"
