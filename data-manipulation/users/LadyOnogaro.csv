I definitely do not believe these women deserve to be murdered or that they were ""asking for it"" by their situations. I do NOT believe they are complicit in their murders, no. You asked why it was that their murders are not investigated. I believe that law enforcement and governmental entities in general believe women who are killed--often, no matter who they are but particularly if they are poor, mentally ill, addicted, etc.--are complicit in their own murders, and that's why they (governmental bodies, most of which are comprised of privileged white people, esp. white men) wrongly ignore these deaths and do not do the investigations they are supposed to be doing."

UnresolvedMysteries,ffdv4n3,t1_ffcvuqu,1579829694.0,"I think you have to look at the socio-economic status of many of these women and girls. People view them as ""throw aways,"" or they see them as complicit in their own fates, sort of ""well, if she hadn't been doing what she was doing or going where she was going, it wouldn't have happened to her."" The same thing happens with victims of rape. Many in the public see the victim as being at fault.

EDIT: Just to be clear, in no way do I believe murder victims, esp. murdered women, to be throwaway people. I'm saying that law enforcement doesn't investigate the deaths of poor women in the way that they do rich women (although rich women are not immune to accusations of ""courting their own deaths"").  All murders should be investigated, no matter the socio-economic status of the victim. All these victims had mothers, fathers, children, etc. who loved them. I'm just saying that a lot of law enforcement and others involved in investigations seem to rank murders in terms of socio-economic status and gender, and women always seem to come at the bottom of the list, especially if they are poor. It shouldn't be this way, but it seems to me to be that way, unfortunately. I'm sorry if my response didn't make that clear, but I think that's why the FBI doesn't investigate this epidemic."

UnresolvedMysteries,feckaz8,t3_eo8bmo,1578975992.0,"There's St. Louis Jane Doe from when I lived in St. Louis. I lived in Wellston, and the Jane Doe there was found in the neighboring community, University City, on a street that is really close to Wellston. That case haunts me.

I live in Lafayette, Louisiana and the unsolved case I know if here is [Crystal Grebinger](http://charleyproject.org/case/crystal-dupuis-grebinger). She had left a women's shelter and then disappeared. Only one of her shoes was ever found. People pretty much suspect her husband. (I sure do.)"

UnresolvedMysteries,fea00vb,t1_fe9dc5u,1578943000.0,"This happened to me and my sister. It was early in the morning before school started, and this guy was out there. He offered us modeling jobs, but of course we weren't going to leave and go with him. He said he'd be out there the next morning. I told my mother about it, and she said she'd talk to him about it. When she showed up and went to talk to him, he first thought she was my older sister (my mom was only 17 when she had me). But then he realized that she was my mom and that she wasn't going to let us go anywhere alone with him, so he drove off and then he never returned, thank goodness."
