GYM,ffevnar,t1_ffeve0e,1579867477.0,"To be honest I'm only just getting into working out for the first time in a while so it's probably best I don't worry too much about gains today, I can focus on that when I've got my body used to the exercise. Running is always good as a warmup so I'll definitely do that, and working all parts of my muscles will be great. Thanks for the advice :)"
