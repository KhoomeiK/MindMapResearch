Nothing works. No joy no drive. I’m seen as the little kid, no matter what I do. There’s more but if I write anymore I’ll be reminded of how much of a loser I still am."
depression,fenpkiq,t3_epvzb0,1579288976.0,"We’re all doomed, and there’s no coming back. It’s crazy to think we were all kids at one point but that light gets diminished each year. At this point, maybe it’s my bitterness, but why bother sheltering kids? It’s all going to fail. I failed. Why should I give hope and happiness to some snot nosed kid?
Oh great, I’m turning into a conservative boomer. Whoo."
depression,fenorww,t3_eq0um9,1579288729.0,Read my recent post. I’m just a background character who’s probably going to die soon.
depression,fdeie7p,t3_ekpvdz,1578339680.0,"Same. At the moment I’m afraid of the world. Idk, I watch too much news. Plus crap that happens in my own life. That and at the realization we’re fully committed to killing ourselves (as a planet.) idk why but I’m always nervous and scared that I will fuck up so bad that I will he killed...idk how to explain it exactly. Even with small decisions are making me spiral; if I have a soda I will have diabetes etc. and I normally don’t think this way. I got a girl atm but I’m worried she will cheat on me. That she will find the cracks in myself and peace out. I’m worried that my low sleep will kill me (I’m trying to wake up early but I can’t because of late night FOMO).
I’ve been working out for years but all of a sudden I’m getting doubts. I’m worried I will fuck up on a lift or that I’ll just stay stagnant. Hell I even got anxious and became so down after someone destroyed me on a FB group in which I disagreed with the OP on something I believed was closed minded. More and more I’m getting the feeling I don’t belong. I see people my age and everyone on social media is cold. It feels like everyone’s about “hustling” and everyone is a shark meanwhile I’m a whale. I’m worried about my finances, I’m worried about my credit score, I’m not even over the crap that’s happened in my life. 
Logically I can say this is all depression or something like that. But a part of me thinks I’m really not. That the world is becoming colder and colder. I don’t think I’m crazy or mental-for example earlier I heard a convo between two coworkers and all they said was, “HEY HOW ARE YOU?” “GOOD N YOU?” “GOOD” “THATS NICE” “THE WEATHER”
Oh god I’m losing my mind. I’m not ok."
