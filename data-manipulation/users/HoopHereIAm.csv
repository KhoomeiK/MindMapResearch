After that praise I’m actively taking communications courses to sharpen my skills as much as I can so that I can eventually become decent at it without as much anxiety and discomfort.

starwarsmemes,fdlcpzy,t1_fdl7vjl,1578521222.0,"The way I saw it was that Maul, post halving, tried to set up a rival Sith order with him and Savage. Palpatine later discovered this faction and killed Savage while keeping a now -submissive Maul alive (after a thorough electric cooking) to be his puppet on Mandalore. Ventress was Dooku’s own apprentice and assassin, as well as his best Separatist operative, who he would appoint the title of Darth once Palpatine passed away with old age (guess he didn’t know about the life-sustaining shit Ol’ Sheev had in TROS) or until Dooku or the Jedi killed him, continuing the Rule of Two should Order 66 fail and the Sith be forced to wait for a new opportunity for revenge. 

As for your claim that they’re just apprentices, would you call Cal Kestis or Ahsoka Tano “not Jedi” just because they were Padawans? Just because Ventress and Savage did not attain the rank of Darth did not bar them from being members of the Sith order (Sith orders, I guess). 

Lastly, Anakin was never fully committed to the Jedi. He only stayed with them because they mostly had the same goals (help others, oppose crime (especially slavery and piracy), war, and death, etc) and because they were all he’d ever known. But his Sith tendencies were always there, lurking under the surface: his willingness to kill people to save his friends (CW “Voyage of Temptation”), his outright approval of then-Captain Tarkin, his murder of people in times of rage (“I SLAUGHTERED THEM LIKE ANIMALS!”), and the list goes on. He was the perfect target for Sheev to manipulate his into becoming his apprentice, since he was part-Sith all along."

I’m so happy Season 7 will soon be released because it finally gives us a real ending to such a beloved series.

As for the main crew, they fucking suck. I know my opinion is significantly influenced by the scathing reviews of Rebels by Cosmonaut Variety Hour, but I can’t be the only one who agrees with Marcus. Zeb is cliched and pointless, Sabine is more of a Mary Sue than Rey ever was (at age 16, she’s basically Mando in regards to skills and she takes up the mantle of fucking legend Pre Vizla on top of possessing the black saber), Kannan, as the mentor character, was practically digging his grave from day one, and Ezra, baby space Aladdin, is the most inconsistent, annoying little motherfucker that just fucks up each and every episode with his shitty dialogue atop his being the main character of the series.
