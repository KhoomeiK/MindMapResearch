Basically, the first “decade” only had 9 years, but because that was so far back in time and we don’t often have a need to narrow historical events that far back down that precisely, we usually refer to events that happened that long ago down to the century and not the decade.

You were talking about how they didn’t work hard enough to earn their money, even though they represent Britain to foreign dignitaries, so a lot of outreach and public awareness to causes, etc. They don’t just sit around all day watching TV. 

I mentioned Billionaires, you said they don’t earn their money, so I asked about millionaires. 

I’m trying to have an actual conversation with you, but you keep bringing up the same tired points and it’s obvious you have absolutely no idea how the system works there. 

They want their royal family and if they no longer want a parliamentary monarchy, they have an easy way to remove the monarchy part. No one’s forcing them to have a monarchy of any kind, so whether it makes sense to you or not is a moot point. You don’t get to tell people living in other countries that their traditional government is trash, especially when that government isn’t actively murdering and oppressing people like other governments. 

You haven’t contributed anything worthwhile to this conversation and I’m done talking to you. I’ve presented you with facts and explanations going beyond the surface, and you’ve responded with whataboutisms as if you’re a 15-year-old who only knows how to view things in the surface and doesn’t bother to think that perhaps things might be more complicated than “royalty bad; poor people good”.

I hope you learn more about the complicated intricacies of the world and how we can’t just demolish entire governments without thinking about all the consequences, including how the royal family provides a sense of pride for the British, just as our declaring independence from them provides Americans with a sense of pride. 

Removing the royal family from British life could provide a deep sense of loss, both morally and economically, especially during the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. 

As Americans, we don’t and can’t fully understand how intertwined and firmly established the idea of a monarchy is in the minds and culture of the British people. This is one of the complexities that lies below the surface. It doesn’t matter, because this will always be a moot point for us. Only the British get to decide about the future of their monarchy and all we get to do is shut up. We decided a long time  ago that a monarchy wasn’t for us, so we no longer have a say in it.

>  ""they let the government pay them 'far less than market value' to live in their castles""

What?! The government basically owns the castles. All money made from the castles goes to the government to pay for running the country. They get a teeny tiny amount of that as The Sovereign Fund. It doesn’t come out of British taxes, it comes from money made from the castles they live in, like Buckingham and Windsor. The Sovereign Fund is a tiny amount of what the castles actually bring in annually. 

There are a few smaller castles like Sandringham that the queen personally owns that she inherited through her family that have nothing to do with her being a monarch. 


> face it dude, there's simply no way for you to make a rational argument in defense of monarchy in a progressive western country in 2020.

It’s their fucking choice to have a monarchy so leave it the fuck alone. No ones forcing them to have a monarchy and they have it set up so that they can dissolve the monarchy quite simply through Parliament. If they don’t feel like a monarchy is right for them, then they can very simply stop. You don’t have a fucking say, so just stop. 

I don’t see the British monarchy doing any harm. It’s not costing taxpayers anything (less than £1 per taxpayer) in fact it’s actually bringing revenue into the country. The Queen and other senior royals are extremely popular among the British and they know the ins and outs of how the monarchy works within their government than we do, so I’m going to trust their judgment and agree with them that if they want a parliamentary monarchy, then let them have one. We don’t get a say in their government."

The monarch has a right to live there, but she doesn’t own them. Any money made off these estates (which is a large amount of money) goes to the British government to run the country. Because these castles technically don’t belong to the queen personally, the public is able to take tours when the queen is not living there. 

Other castles, like Sandringham, are private properties of the queen and are not open to the public. Those have been inherited through her family and not through the monarchy. 

Your example of Mount Vernon is not an appropriate one. The US consciously chose to renounce any type of monarchy as a viable form of government for us, and in doing so, we renounced any type of heredity rule. Why would we want to pay Washington’s descendants if we renounced that very type of government? Washington himself wouldn’t have allowed it. After winning the revolutionary war, many wanted to make George Washington our king and he turned them down.

More importantly, some people with depression respond really well to antidepressants while some show almost no improvement after they start taking antidepressant medication. The study was trying to figure out why. 

This study focused on giving people diagnosed with depression either a placebo or the same specific antidepressant and showing them images with conflicting emotions (happy face with the word “fear” or scared face with the word “happy). They used a special MRI machine to monitor the brain while the subjects were being shown these images. 

They found that the subjects whose brains were automatically able to deal with the conflicting emotions on the antidepressants, also showed better progress with their depression in general, while the subjects who were on the antidepressant and whose brains had trouble dealing with the conflicting emotions still had trouble with their depression overall. 

These results showed that the current diagnosis of depression is too broad and they might be dealing with different illnesses. 

However, the subjects that were given the antidepressants were all given the *same* antidepressant, and as anyone who’s ever had to do the whole trial-and-error to find the right antidepressant knows, what works for one person is absolute shit for another. I’m wondering if the people for whom the antidepressant didn’t work just didn’t get the correct antidepressant for their brain chemistry."

Ever since the 2016 election, Trump has been sowing doubt in the election process with cries of “voter fraud”. For pretty much all of 2019, he’s been telling his supporters that it’s impossible for Democrats to defeat him in a *legitimate* election. 

He’s been setting the stage to have his supporters claim that the 2020 election is invalid if he loses. We all know that his supporters don’t listen to facts and the impeachment process so far has shown that the GOP doesn’t give a fuck about the Constitution or foreign interference in our elections as long as they win, so what happens? 

What happens if Trump says the election is rigged and the results are invalid and he has Congress behind him as well as the conservative majority on the Supreme Court? Keep in mind that a conservative-leaning Supreme Court essentially decided the 2000 election in favor of Bush when they reversed the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Bush v Gore. 

The FL Secretary of State, a die-hard Republican has stopped a recount when the votes showed Bush winning. The state Supreme Court ordered a recount. The Federal Supreme Court stopped the recount ensuring a Bush victory. Media analysis of the ballots showed that Gore would’ve won the state had the recount proceeded. 

Right now Trump and the Republicans have all the power. Our voting system is insecure and many states have no secure paper trail. McConnell has repeatedly blocked votes on securing our election system from both outside influence and from voting machines being hacked. 

This isn’t defeatist — this is a very real possibility that we need to be prepared for so that we can figure out ways to fight it. Trump and the Republicans have proven that they don’t give a fuck about our Constitution, our Democracy, or the people of this country, so we need to figure out a way to get their crime-riddled hands off of it and take our country back."

Why is he keeping documents from the House if he made a “perfect phone call” and has done nothing wrong — wouldn’t the documents exonerate him?
