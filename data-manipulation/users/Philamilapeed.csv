MonsterHunter,fd6l4eh,t3_ek3fbr,1578192618.0,"Nergigante subspecies, where the Nerg developed a mutation early in life that, due to its healing factor, progressed into aggressive, tumorous growths. This Nergigante has much weaker armour (weapons never bounce even at red sharpness, and every hitzone is very weak), is covered in cancerous growths instead of spikes, and can't fly; it relies on brute force from it's punches, slams, headbutts, and a greatly increased rate of regeneration. We'll call him Malignant Nergigante.

""But that just sounds like a weaker Nergigante"" I hear you say. ""What's the catch?""

Well, there's two. The first catch is those tumorous growths are all muscle tissue. As you break his parts, the tumors return much larger and attacks with that body part do more damage and cover a wider area (up to 3 times per part). By the time you break the final part for the final time, it basically no longer resembles a Nergigante and is more of a roiling pile of angry flesh.

The second catch: Malignant Nergigante has no HP limit! In order to defeat him, you have to break each part (Head, each Fore Leg, each Rear Leg, each Wing, and the Tail) three times. You have no choice but to make it more dangerous as the fight goes on. But once you've gotten the final break, it goes into a fit of rage, where all you have to do is survive it's rapid, unpredictable attacks and deal a final chunk of damage, before it goes down for good, it's healing factor stretched to the limit.

Anyway, that is my long-winded subspecies idea. My favourite existing subspecies is Baleful Giginox, because he's the best cave monster."
