I've never used Actix, but put it this way: if it's so valuable to commercial vendors, then perhaps the appropriate approach would have been to put their hands in their pockets and hand over some dough."

mm_ballbusting,fcxf5n4,t1_fcxe66o,1578061315.0,"OK, thanks. I'll investigate. I've never run a Reddit group before, so I don't know how things work. 

(I think) I've set ""automod"", so new posts are accepted on this subreddit without my manual intervention. It's a little unclear, though, as I get an ""approve"" box.

It's of course a little tricky as I can't be sure as to whether what I can see is the same as what everyone else can see."
mm_ballbusting,fcxexho,t1_fcxdzjp,1578061138.0,"Yes, I had been saying that they need a free tier, too.

Their Scaffcons seems to generate sufficient revenue - more or less - and I think they have cash reserves. So money isn't a pressing issue, I don't think.

My prediction is that the site will enter a slow death spiral. Far fewer people will cough up a subscription than say they will. There are some people who submit content, or chat with each other, who aren't subscribers. That will disappear. Content will dry up, and the whole thing will basically lose its point.

At least on here, the site isn't deathly slow. 

If there's only going to be a group of about 30 people on it, then they don't need a website, I don't think. Instead they need some kind of private chat, like kik, or something. 

We'll see, I guess.

Maybe they'll reach a point, or maybe they have already, where they decide that running a website is too much hassle for them anyway.

Maybe a new concept will emerge from the ashes of the existing site. Time will tell."

TumblrInAction,fcmxvej,t1_fcmh2cr,1577796997.0,"Yeah, but the Jews don't whine, they just get on with life. Jews have been heavily victimised (Nazi Germany being one example) in ways that really matter, so you'd think the SJWs would be on their side. But nope, that's not how things work.

I think it comes down whether people internalise or externalise their experiences. People who internalise things have what might be called a ""growth"" mindset, in which they see themselves as accountable for their actions and results. Like the Jews; although obviously they don't think they ""deserve"" to be in concentration camps.

People who externalise have what might be called a ""victim"" mindset, in which all their woes are the result of ""the other"". SJWs are victimhood incarnate. Everything is everybody's fault. So they love things like Black Lives Matter."
