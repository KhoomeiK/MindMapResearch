Nolan's joker seemed much more methodical to me, the unhinged insanity was definitely there, but it often seemed more like a mask used to propagate the goal of a far more cold/calculating villain.

Take the scene with him and dent in hospital. He continually emphasises that he's ""a dog chasing cars"" and that what happened wasn't part of some plan. That he should seek revenge against Maroni and the police. We know this to be false, he orchestrated the whole thing. He gets into Batman's head and leads him to save Harvey instead of Rachel, thus leading to the events that turned him into two face.

He's morally insane and has no regard for his life or the lives of others, but his primary goal was focused. He wants anarchy. He wants to show everyone that they are one bad day from becoming him. First by killing the Batman so the mob could bring it, then by realising this would still be the same sort control albeit for the other side (the ""It would be so boring"" speech). Therefore he moves to more direct means of causing anarchy and forcing people into situations where they will harm others.

Two face, the boat scene, the little gladiator match after killing Gamble, even trying to get Bruce to murder him. It's all to show that the world is hypocritical of his lack of morality.

Hell, compare it to the latest Joker. Joaquin's joker was amazing, but totally different. He really was just some unhinged dude. He didn't mean to start a movement and often killed without reason.

SW just felt like a cash grab playing off old nostalgia, evident by *another fucking death star*.

All the questions that were set up in the first were just dashed.

GoT's issue was that it was rushed, but it's an issue because they *did* have the material. I'm quite sure the ending in the book is going to be the ending in the book. The difference is that the book has two entire novels to lead in that direction and allow it to make sense whereas D&D just leaped there without reason.

Not to say Endgame was some shining beacon of plot. It mainly gets by because anyone who didn't idolise the film is met with rabid nerd rage.

I definitely disagree with this, also. Characters just didn't use their powers half the time so that everyone might get a shot in the big action sequences.
