AskReddit,ffv8pyc,t1_ffv7awc,1580258347.0,"You don't know what you're talking about, so please stop. You learned that tax brackets on the EZ form only apply to income in its respective bracket, and you think that defines some fundamental law of taxation for all. You're wrong.

When you have five dependents, including adoptions, own a home, are involved in alternative fuel, etc., you can stack several tax credits, which are not bracketed, but dry up very quickly as you pass one or two hard lines in income. These credits can be, for example, $2500 for everyone regardless of income, but then drop to $1000 if you make $75,000 or more, and then $0 if you make $100,000. No brackets, no sliding scale. I was a little unlucky in that twice in my career I got raises, less than or not much more than $1,000 over the year each time, but which pushed me across one of those thresholds causing a couple thousand dollars or more in lost tax credits each time. Hence, my income went up, and my taxes went up even more, and so overall I made $500 - $1500 less each year it happened.

It doesn't happen to many people, it takes a combination of factors, and it takes getting a small raise that pushes you over a big threshold. If I had an accountant or tax attorney or something working for me I maybe could've avoided it, but I wasn't that wealthy, we aren't talking 1% money here. But I wasn't wrong, the income and the taxes were correct, I took home less because I made more."

Putting glass over it (like in a frame) is probably the best technique, because then you can put the image in front of you but focus on your reflection, which is, virtually, 2x distance away. It's just about getting your brain to lock onto an image that only appears when your eye muscles aren't focusing on it.

Play around with cross-eye illusions. Hold your finger up while you look at something farther away. Do you see two transparent fingers? Now do it with two fingers, and try to get a pair of transparent fingers to overlap into a solid illusion finger. Play around with what you focus on while you do this. Look up some cross-eye 3d illusions on the Internet. The ""Magic Eye"" pictures are just a computerized version of this. The black dots are placed by an algorithm so that if you defocus your eyes and spread the picture into two transparent pictures, at some point the dots from each eye's image will overlap with one another to create an illusory 3D shape. You just have to get your brain to recognize and lock onto it.

Eventually what you're looking at is a cross-eyed or double-vision version of the entire original picture, but where the two unfocused, hazy versions of the image overlap each other in the middle, a clear 3D shape emerges."

I do 90% of the cooking when I'm home (including dinner almost every night), I put 3/4 of the kids to bed at night and get 3/4 of them to school/bus in the morning, and, while I'm not at work, I do at least half of the childcare and about 1/4 of routine cleaning and 1/4 of the shopping.

- Determinism is ubiquitous and non-falsifiable. It isn't valuable as an argument for or against anything. Might as well say that free will doesn't exist because God makes everything happen. It's logically the same.

- Free doesn't mean free from existence. If free will is a meaningful concept at all, one which can even be argued to exist or not, then 'free' must be something more specific and meaningful than ""unbound by anything at all, even existence itself.""

- We use free will in a meaningful sense in real life. ""Being of sound mind, and of my own free will..."" that means something people understand. This should clue you into the possibility that there is a flaw in whatever reasoning has led you to think it doesn't exist.

- I can reason and imagine multiple possible and likely futures. This reasoned imagination itself becomes part of the causal chain leading me to act in preference for some futures over others. This is called making a choice, and under most conditions is an exercise of free will. A rock rolling down a hill does not do what I just described. The notion that it was nevertheless all pre-determined, that there was only one future that ever actually would be, may be true, but it doesn't change anything I said before this sentence.

- Arguments against free will often rely on an incoherent notion of a self that is somehow acted upon and constrained by those things which comprise it. My memories and preferences and experiences and brain cells and what-not, somehow these aren't ""me,"" but they are external forces that constrain me. So what is me?

I didn't find them impossible, though you do have to repeat several times and figure out a strategy. The main thing is that you should never be standing around waiting for something to happen. If you are, then you're not doing things in the right order. Go do some other task and then come back to whatever it is you're waiting on.

There are usually multiple ways to accomplish a lot of the tasks, and often one way is much faster. Also often you can chain together several tasks in a matter of seconds if you plan it out and time it right.

The timed challenges to me are the ""real"" game. That's the only time I felt like a wild animal on the loose causing mayhem. The rest of the game felt more like a stealth game compared to that."
