80s,fe0bpct,t3_ejuaqe,1578808936.0,"Early 80s was different than the 70s. Pants were going slimmer (smaller than bell bottoms, eventually leading to tight pants). Collars and ties became slimmer at the same speed. 

Colors were different. Less orange, brown, yellow, green, more towards pastels and reds and blues. 

Hair went right in the middle of the feathering of the 70s and the big hair of the mid 80s. 

It’s like imaging if the was a morph video between the late 70s and mid 80s. The early 80s would be right in the middle of that video. 

It’s actually my favorite time period for fashion. Kind of a mellow, chilled out style compared to the late 70s and late 80s.

One said, “We COULD get in, but we have the Gestapo over here keeping us outside.” Meaning me. 

Looking back, I should have told the guy to leave right then. But I just looked at him and said, “You know, I have the choice to NEVER let you in.”

He apologized and kissed my ass the rest of the time in line. 

The funniest part is that they never made it inside. They were in line for at least an hour and had made it to the very front. They waited there a good 20 minutes. The next pair of people that came out were their friends! And they wanted to leave."

I’ve been a bartender for 20 years now. I really wish I had gotten into another field. 

This field of business is fucking hard. I’m so burned out but I don’t know where else to go for work. 

Also, I’ve worked with soooo many barbacks that want to move up to bartender. I think I’ve seen 2 make that leap in all my years. 

So imagine this—you’re 45, and still a barback. The money is good but it’s physically a very tough job. Not to mention stressful as hell. (There’s also the fact that most people in the industry end up as alcoholics or get into drugs.) Do you want to be stuck there?
