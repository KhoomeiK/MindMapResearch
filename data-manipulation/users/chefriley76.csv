 I am only paying $1500 for the anaesthesia (who wasn't in my HMO network...don't get me started) and $2000 of the hospital bill. It could have been very bad, but it turned out to be a mild inconvenience overall."

SouthFlorida,fdkjmu8,t3_eljn81,1578505066.0,"My son just graduated with his AA. He graduated in mid December, and he was already accepted into FAU. 

The 2+2 program is AMAZING in Florida. When you graduate with your AA, you are guaranteed admittance to a Florida University. It just may not be your first choice, but it's way easier applying with an AA than straight out of high school. Not to mention you get all your prereqs out of the way on the cheap."
