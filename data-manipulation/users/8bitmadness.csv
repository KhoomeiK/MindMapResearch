MMORPG,ffbl0ag,t1_ffbjnn1,1579770424.0,"It was a sarcastic comment. PvE content drives economies in most MMOs, and also brings in players. PvP is obviously going to draw in some of the playerbase, but not all of it. There's definitely some games that did full PvP better than others but they tend to be much more niche."

DnD,ff8m3wm,t3_erwgko,1579685281.0,"Having played a crapton of 3.5e, I still get shivers down my spine whenever artificer is mentioned because they can do some terrifying shit. Like, there's a reason why a well played artificer is considered tier 0. They can literally emulate ANY spell from ANY spell list up to level 4 in 3.5e.

However, The characters behind the class are usually amazing, and this is a great example of one. great character design overall."
dndnext,ff77wzo,t1_ff67a1y,1579642873.0,That's a good one as well.
dndnext,ff5hyfl,t3_erm7qm,1579593699.0,"Here's an interesting thing you left out: It's been pretty standard across many editions of D&D and even within Pathfinder that if you successfully save against spells, you KNOW you've been targeted with magic but you DON'T know what spell you were targeted with nor do you know who cast it at you if anyone.

Playing with this concept is actually really helpful as you could potentially restrict it to spellcasters, or in a campaign where magic is so common that even the martial characters know some of the theory behind it they'd also be able to tell if they shrugged off a spell, especially the mental ones. However, you could also make this a bit deeper (using the mental effects here as an example) by making it much more subtle and asking them to make an arcana check or maybe an int check to determine if that little mental misstep a PC made while on watch was a spell failing to effect them or if it was just them being a bit absentminded.

It gives more depth to the roleplaying aspect of the game and personally I really love it."

Guildwars2,ff52eky,t1_ff51bfw,1579578376.0,"You do know I'm aware of that, right? Hence why I said that I doubt Vulpera know BOTH common and orcish as reported by wowhead, as the two languages are the faction languages of the alliance and horde respectively, and Vulpera in their big release announcement a while back said they were joining the horde. Blizz really doesn't like people being able to talk to each other if they're in different factions unless they're friends on battle.net."
Guildwars2,ff4unym,t1_ff3vtxc,1579572859.0,"the racials are definitely different though, which is kinda nice. Apparently Vulpera are kinda OP as you basically get a second hearthstone you can bind to almost anywhere. What's even weirder is that wowhead says they know common AND orcish, which I doubt because blizz doesn't want it to be easy to communicate with the opposing faction."

What aspects of horror did I use in it? Uncertainty, paranoia, and most importantly of all, tension plus suspense. If you can use these, you can make a high fantasy horror campaign work even when things like teleport are a thing."

dndnext,fep663u,t1_fengrue,1579313011.0,"Simple: If there's no explicit rule on it, just follow existing rules OR consult your DM. It's that basic.

Also as for why armor does that when you try to inflict wounds someone, that's just a remnant of how they changed the system. Lots of spells were imported from previous editions and then had their numbers changed, and one of the big things was that offensive spells with a range of touch needed to be changed such that you made a spell attack with them, hence why it has you make a melee spell attack. I'd also argue that it was intentional because that way a blaster character can't just sit in the backline flinging cantrips at a target and having them always take damage at lower levels."
dndnext,fep4sqj,t1_fekzg3b,1579312133.0,"yeah low power or more dark fantasy stuff has its place in different systems, as they do that kind of fantasy WAY better than D&D's settings tend to do."

Still, there's definitely a good subset of tabletop gamers who actually ENJOY the crunch. I'm one of those guys, but I also love elegant systems so it's kinda a double edged sword."

Strongest monster in it was the Neutronium Golem, which has well over 2 million health, I think an AC of over 900, its natural slam attack had over +500 to hit and would deal an average of 200k damage, and IIRC the challenge rating was somewhere above 9500. Somehow manage to kill it? Well congrats, that's a fort save vs a DC of like, 200 to not be disintegrated and IIRC the range for disintegration is like, over 100 miles in terms of the radius. The suggestions for adventures range from mid cosmic to high cosmic. The supplements it's from basically add ways to become deities and beyond. Overdeities? yeah, you can go past that. I believe there's ""time lords"" with divine ranks over 100 and nearly 1000 HD. To put that into perspective, the neutronium golem only has 250 HD, though that hit die IS d1000.

Shit was fucking INSANE. Taking your average adventure and then scaling it up to the point where it feels like you're playing Asura's Wrath actually was pretty fun at times."
dndnext,fejfogm,t1_feiww8x,1579171962.0,"Can confirm, had to forever GM through 4e and it was a weird experience. It's honestly way easier to run if you can put all the stacking bonuses and penalties into a program so that you don't have to remember them off the top of your head. There's a reason 4e would have done better as a CRPG: The ""faster"" combat actually was quite slow because of all the constant number crunching you had to do thanks to bonuses and penalties from multiple sources constantly stacking and fucking about."
dndnext,fejfjk6,t1_feh1e9h,1579171761.0,"Not just physical punishment. HP represents your character's general state, especially when it comes to health and battle readiness. Your HP could be low not because you have any wounds, but because you're becoming mentally exhausted from having to put your all into not dying during battle. This could explain why cure wounds has a range of healing possible even when you cast it with the highest level spell slot available when it comes to fluff. A bad roll on that is because you cured what physical wounds were there, but there's things that were not able to be cured with that casting. Obviously repeated castings can bring you back to max HP, but that just means that the cure wounds spell is finally getting to mending the nonphysical ""wounds"" you have."

pokemongo,fcwngls,t1_fcuey7y,1578030675.0,"I can assure you, it's happened before. HOAs in suburban areas of major cities sometimes are in charge of public spaces that are accessible to those from the HOA's community, and those who are from outside of that community. Sometimes, those HOAs kinda end up power tripping and try to restrict who can and cannot use it, even when the space itself isn't actually OWNED by them and they are just the ones who take care of the space itself. At that point a legal battle can happen, and usually what happens is the HOA is told ""You don't own it, deal with it."" Rarely, however, the HOA has been taking care of the areas for so long that they can claim adverse possession and the land that was once public becomes private, allowing them to decide who can and cannot use it.

TL;DR it's happened and it's actually kinda important because HOAs sometimes take care of land that doesn't legally belong to them simply because people in that HOA use the space(s) often."

wow,fctkqe6,t3_eikh6v,1577946821.0,"Compounding probability though. You've got a chance EACH TIME you run. That means given the listed chance of Apophis striking Earth (which is outdated) will be LESS than the chance of getting Invicible after you've made a total of 3 ICC runs (at which point the approximate probability of getting Invincible would be 2.97%).

Also for those of you despairing about the drop rate: It's just as bad as you think. it takes about 229 runs to reach a 90% chance of getting it to drop. It takes DOUBLE that, 458 runs, to hit a 99% chance of it dropping. In other words, if RNGesus hates you, even if you have 10 alts running it every week, it will still take you nearly a YEAR for it to drop and even then it's STILL not guaranteed."

It's in an area where you can find mountain lions, deer, bobcats, coyotes, etc. It's basically as close you can get in a major city to wilderness. I'd just grab my ghillie suit that I made last year for airsoft (I used plants local to that parkland for it), my hiking framepack, fill two gallon jugs with water and put them in there along with a sleeping bag and sleeping pad. Add some camo netting I've got, some pitons, some paracord, and an E-tool I bought at a military surplus store back in high school. Ghillie suit is in the bag at the top. Wear a hoodie and quickly walk to the entrance of the parkland from my home at around 3am. Put on the ghillie suit as soon as I'm completely out of line of sight. Go to one of the secret locations where there's a big depression in the ground. I'll use the E-tool to dig a bit deeper and then I'll cover this spot with the camo netting as well as some sticks and other stuff found around the area. I can get to this location without disturbing any of the plants in the surrounding area and the ground is mostly chalk so you don't really leave footprints. It's around a half a mile from any homes and also doesn't have cell coverage. It's a dead zone and even people who hike a lot never go near it because it's COMPLETELY overgrown. I'd be able to wait out 48 hours there and all I'd need to do is sit in comfort. I'd be insulated thanks to the sleeping pad during winter, and during summer I'd be pretty shaded and in an area that's relatively cool most of the time compared to the surroundings, so that just leaves the water I took which is all I'll need for the next 48 hours.

Games take time to develop, especially MMOs. an MMO will average around 6 years at least in development from start to finish, and again, that's an AVERAGE. And to give you some perspective here for some big games: TF2 took 9 years, L.A. Noire took 7 years, Spore took 8 years, the original Shenmue took 6 years, and Diablo III took 11 years.

So you expect gameplay videos when they had to add onto that development cycle with DEVELOPING A BRAND NEW ENGINE TO SUPPORT WHAT WAS ENVISIONED?! Well for one, there ARE videos from earlier in beta 1 with general gameplay, though lacking some elements. On top of that, the development cycle of this game has effectively been in the public eye the entire time. It's a kickstarted game, after all. On top of that, a lot of announced features are from the ""BSC"" days. BSC stands for Bat Shit Crazy. They were throwing ideas around that might never actually be implemented, so you can't really use them as an example of CSE lying.

Tl;DR there is no reasonable inference to make here, and ""because there is no gameplay to record"" is objectively false because there are ACTUAL videos of gameplay, they're just few and far between due to the restrictive NDA (which honestly is industry standard)."

CamelotUnchained,fc50c1f,t1_fc4idtr,1577436567.0,"There's no definitive proof that they are or aren't, so positing they are is frankly really dumb. If they deliver an actual game, you're probably going to feel pretty dumb about these comments, so rather than being a debby downer, just watch and wait. Whatever happens happens, and if they are just building an engine to license the outrage will be legendary."

Otherwise NTA, though it'd be in your best interest if you used a reformation tincture or other aperitif designed to make it safe for them. IANAL, but his family can and likely WILL sue you for a large amount if he doesn't reform post digestion, and if you can't pay they can put a lien on your body (this means they can literally ""repossess"" body parts from you in order to pay off your debt). Even if they lose in court, they might pay a more experienced pred to take you out as well.

Either way, lawyer up for sure, and contact an attorney that specializes in vore law. There's plenty that will work on contingency."
CamelotUnchained,fbxkubv,t3_ef0kpj,1577192105.0,"Beta 1 is the current phase of testing. It's planned and scheduled in advance, not freeform at the moment. The later stages, that is Beta 2 and 3 are going to likely be more something that can just be played as is, but I doubt they're going to let progress be saved before launch as this is an RvR game and while the progression is horizontal, that still can give a pretty huge advantage to one faction on a given server."
