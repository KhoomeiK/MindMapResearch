interestingasfuck,ffb75a6,t1_ffb4cu4,1579753610.0,"If an artists worth is dictated by how much detail and realism they can put in their paintings then anyone with a camera is a better artist than da Vinci.

Da vinci excelled in his technical abilities in regards to painting, especially given his historical period, and he deserves a lot of praise for his ability to wield a brush. But (to name another artist), few people are going to consider John Baeder as ""better than da vinci"", even though he clearly has a much better ability to paint. This is because da Vinci has an ability to make audiences feel things that Baeder does not. (Imo, chiefly because his reputation influences people to believe his art is having a big effect on them, bigger than it would if he was an unknown artist.) And, to go back to my previous point, munch has earned a reputation and cultural impact on par with da vinci not because he's as good with a brush as the Italian, but because his paintings stuck around in people's heads.

If munch and da vinci can be (reasonably) equally well known and respected for their art, and artistic quality is in the eye of the beholder, then both of them produced equally meritable art."
interestingasfuck,ffb68e3,t1_ffb3qti,1579752892.0,"Your comparison to engineering unlines the issue with this line of thought though. You are approaching art purely as a pragmatic venture, where ""an artist should strive to make the *best* technical art"". A six gigabyte CAD drawing can have just as much skill time and effort poured into it as the mona lisa, yet the typical person would not consider it ""art"" because it evokes no reaction. 

While effort and technical skill are undoubtedly deserving of praise, ""how well you can replicate reailty"" is not a good measure of artistic ability, because if it was, whoever has the best camera will always be the best artist.

The crux of it is that the more you focus on how ""technical"" an art peice is, the less you reward actual artistic thought, creativity and divergence from the mainstream. And those three things are what I believe are the most important things in art."
interestingasfuck,ffb2dfq,t1_ffb07ob,1579750053.0,"The issue of course is that ""effort"" is a terrible way of judging art. Like, to the point that its literally the argument used by nazis to discredit artists.

Art, it has been decided after centuries of philosophical thought and debate, (and not by me) can only really be defined as ""the result of deliberate human actions that cause a reaction in the observer of said art, regardless of whether those reactions are positive or negative"".

I mean, does da Vinci deserve a better grade than Edward Munch? da Vinci's art was a lot more technically complex, but Munch's was a lot more emotionally intense. Does ""realism"" really have more artistic value than expressionism? If I spend four weeks copying the mona lisa, is that worth more than original art I spend only two weeks on?"

rareinsults,ff5co81,t1_ff55so6,1579587437.0,">There are parties who just want accurate predictions and will pay handsomely for rigorous analysis of what will become of their investments. I have heard of no evidence that finance is reacting in a major way to global warming.

it may simply be the case that it's cheaper to let their investments get destroyed and build new ones. It's possible that they are being willfully ignorant of the truth they paid for. It's possible that they're just trying to stick their head in the sand and only put forth the funds to change when they have no other choice. It's possible that scams exist, successfully selling investments that won't ever pay off. There are a lot of reasons as to why the financial sectors actions may not be the best representation of reality. 

You mention that they pay handsomely for these analyses. Which means  I must ask you to consider: *who* are they paying? Maybe we should listen to those people directly."
rareinsults,ff4uf4t,t1_ff4jbtw,1579572694.0,"As far as I'm aware it's never really been said outside of alarmist groups (and liars) that the oceans were going to rise a gigantic amount. The general story I've always heard was ""one to several meters by the end of the century"" or something along those lines. Perhaps you remember something different. While a  few meters rise won't put half the us underwater, it is enough to put certain very low lying places, like the Netherlands or Kiribati, underwater, and that is worth worrying about just from a humanistic point of view.

Additionally ""beachfront"" doesn't mean ""water literally lapping at the foundation"". In reality the vast majority of beachfront homes have several meters elevation over sea level, spread over many more meters *between* them and the sea. A house sitting on a 60m cliff overlooking the ocean is still technically a ""beachfront property"" and would likely be advertised as such.

Further to that, architects in all likelihood are designing these homes to have specific placement and construction to resist a rising water table while being as close to the ocean as possible. While I haven't studied architecture for a while, as an engineer, it makes sense to me.

Additionally, banks can make a profit off a beachfront property long before its swallowed up by the waves, if it ever is. It wouldn't exactly be unprecedented for an investment to be short lived yet still make a lot of money, because the return on investment in these cases is dictated by more factors than just the lifetime of the land. I mean, scams exist, after all.

Finally, I find it kind of hilarious that you're basing whether or not climate change is real on what the banks think. Why exactly would the banks know better than anyone else? People can be wrong, stupid and fallible no matter how much money they have. You can see photos of coastlines across the world slowly shrinking with a Google search. You can draw your own conclusions, you dont have to defer to the opinions of rich people and big organizations."

HistoryMemes,fewel8u,t1_few9hr4,1579409296.0,"Most of said conquest resulted in purely political changes, and did not result in repression of Christian thought. Furthermore, much of the places that raised armies for the Crusades were never actually subjugated by Muslims in the first place. Even further to that, Christians had actually been *reconquering* land that had been taken by Muslims at the time of the crusades. And even further to *that*, the Christians spent a lot more time stealing, looting, pillaging other Christians, and mass murdering Jews than fighting Muslims during the crusades.

In fact, the actual causes of the Crusades are still hotly debated by historians across the world, with many linking it more closely to the political situation in Byzantium, having loads of christian warriors with nothing to do, and reform within the church, rather than some righteous revenge for the brutal conquering of their lands. I mean, a large amount of the people involved had likely never even seen a Muslim in their life (people's crusade), so you tell me how they could have had the global political awareness to be waging such a war in the name of retribution."
