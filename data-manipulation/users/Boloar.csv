Kissed my 'dream girl', it was literally the happiest I ever felt in my life, true bliss ... And then I woke up. I can't even describe the feeling of depression like a physical weight bringing me down.

Simultaneously the happiest and saddest I'd ever been within the space of a minute, before or since that day nothing else has ever come close."

If you're not already using a digital recording interface (which is basically a small mixer in its own right), then get one. It will have output on the back which you connect to speakers, and a separate headphones output on the front.

Look for one which has at least two inputs, so for example you have the option to record two voices for a podcast, or guitar and voice, simultaneously. One input will limit your options slightly, although it might not be a deal breaker depending on your needs."
audioengineering,ff8kw1p,t1_ff8h4xq,1579683413.0,"Speaking as an amateur, common tip I've been seeing on here is a faster compression on a per-channel basis, and slower compression on the master to even things out. Really useful!"
audioengineering,ff8kqru,t1_ff8h8fj,1579683194.0,"Go see a live orchestra. If it's a good one, you'll notice how the instruments never overpower each other at any volume (brass sometimes being the exception, of course), which is the mark of good musicians working with directions from a good conductor (and of course the written music).

I'm an amateur live mixer for acoustic music shows, and as a classical musician I treat all the instruments like a classical orchestra. Leave 'space' for everything in the mix, compress the loud ones, and I've tried to make a habit of listening to enough music so I have an idea what tends to sound 'right'."
