On your second question, usually with really big trees they start at the top and bring them down in sections. It's safer than just dropping something that big all at once, (they lower the pieces down slowly on ropes usually), and easier to break down if its already cut it into manageable chunks. Eventually it all has to get cut up fit on a trailer and get hauled away, or cut into usable pieces for firewood etc, so there's no upside to cutting it down whole."
nextfuckinglevel,ff6rtkl,t1_ff6p2gv,1579633552.0,"I'm totally guessing, but usually if you're taking down a really big tree you start at the top and bring it down in sections so you can control it more easily on the way down. He'll probably drop down and keep cutting sections.

Edit: the way he is just letting them fall would be pretty dangerous in most settings . If this was a normal, residential tree job with a crew, the pieces would be lowered down with ropes so nothing on the ground gets accidentally crushed."
