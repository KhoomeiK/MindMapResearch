We can joke all we want about Britney's hair-chopping episode, but mental illness is no joke.  People with real schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder cannot function in any way while unmedicated, and they often attempt to discontinue their medications.  Either Britney has one of these conditions, in which case the love and support that enables her to go on performing is amazing; or she's being involuntarily restrained with heavy psychotropic medications as part of a conspiracy to siphon her wealth away from her.  My guess is the former; it's less interesting but seems more likely.

As a counterpoint, I once dated a girl whose brother was in the process of developing full-fledged schizophrenia.  He would stay away from home for weeks at a time, come back complaining of being infested by imaginary parasites.  He couldn't keep his attention on one thing for more than a minute or two.  He would become violent if any attempt was made to redirect his attention from his paranoid delusions, once striking his elderly father (who ironically enough was a child psychologist) in the face.  Meds worked - I once took him to the pharmacy where it took two hours to get him to consent to pick up his Risperdal - but he wouldn't keep them more than a day or so, always flushing them down the toilet.   

When his father developed dementia severe enough to interfere with what caregiving the son would accept, the son went wild for a few months.  Eventually he was incarcerated, first in county jail, then the state hospital for the criminally insane, where he remains several years later.  There was nothing to do about it; it would have taken a team of eight healthy, strong people working round the clock to keep this guy's life manageable, and that simply wasn't available."

personalfinance,ffalp1z,t3_esjrsc,1579738873.0,"Don't tell them that you're not fully committed to your current position until you're absolutely certain that:

1)  You're fully committed to the new position.

2)  The new position actually exists.

The trick to this is understanding that management isn't just management.  You want to start with an informal conversation with the manager who'd be your direct report at the new position.  That means identifying that person and getting them on the phone (no email or text!)  The conversation goes something like this, ""Hi, I'm MinorRunz, in the Freeble group at OldLocation.  But family has asked whether I could move to NewLocation, so they can help out with my mother-in-law's new tentacle!  I love my job so much, so the first thing I wanted to know is whether I could Freeble at NewLocation too!  Freebling is so great and I'm the best Freebler in the company!"" 

Once you understand whether they'd want you in a new position elsewhere, you can then go about the process of thinking about the whens and hows.  If the answer is ""no,"" then you just pretend like the conversation never happened.  If it comes up, you curtly point out that mother-in-law found other help for her new tentacle, then change the subject.

The problem with informing a current direct manager that you're not fully committed to your current position is that it can close the door to promotions, training and raises.  If I knew an employee were moving away in a year, would I give them a hefty promotion and raise?  Hell no, that's a waste; I'd reserve those things for people I expected to still be around in 5 years.  Sure that manager will keep an open-door policy to hear about such things, though; that's their information line, it's how they learn what they need to know to make those decisions."

Why?  Turns out it's a /r/legaladvice type of answer.  Turns out that payments are more than just simple money transfers; they are also one of the legal elements that helps put contracts in force.  Sometimes people accept payment under a contract, proving their intent to be bound by that contract, and then later wish they hadn't.
