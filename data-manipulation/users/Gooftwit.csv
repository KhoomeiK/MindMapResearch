While I agree with this in theory, Nazis and fascists don't care about words. They want to argue only from feelings. If they cared about words and facts, they wouldn't be nazis, because if you do more than 10 minutes of research, you can see that the entire ideology is dogshit. They only follow it because it benefits them and puts them in positions of power.
