csharp,fg46kt6,t1_fg3leax,1580497216.0,"I have had to deal with equipment which suffered performance issues due to excessive standard out logging, so I would agree that it can become expensive.  However, the applications I am developing are to be used for serviceability of equipment, and the logs are part of that serviceability design."
csharp,fg43i0h,t1_fg3ut5a,1580495384.0,"I'm not throwing new exceptions, I rethrow the same exception (throw;).  My libraries that catch, for example, a webexception are not going to contain the logic that logs to filesystem or displays the exception details.  I separated these duties, and allow the exceptions that are being thrown anyway to be caught and released for the sake of having meaningful logs.

And as stated, my log requirements demand that I catch and release in order to log the progress of an exception and provide state and contextual information along the way back upstream, which those who digest the logs find incredibly useful.  To do things differently requires developing more architecture for the sake of addressing concerns that are not seen or observed in my code.  There is no performance concerns in using exceptions like I do in a single user desktop application.

I'm developing serviceability tools with an emphasis on logging the procedure of the application so that there is an increased awareness of problems when they arise, without having to rethrow custom exceptions after encountering webexceptions.

I understand your points though.  They just do not apply here."
csharp,fg3iz26,t1_fg3hqpl,1580482670.0,"I understand that.  I also don't make software that needs to worry about the expense of exceptions.

I write software for a support department which interfaces with equipment that we support.  It's very important for me to have very clear logs on the behavior of the software (we use these logs to help troubleshoot the equipment we work with).  When the exception is thrown and the error message pops up immediately, I see no problem with the way exceptions are being used in my code but I do see better and more informative logs, which is an important part of the software I develop.

There is a time and a place to use them, and some of the alternatives present a lot of muck in my code base.

But you are exactly right, exceptions are more expensive than other options.  I hope exception performance would be improved because it's a very nice way to propagate an exceptional state upstream."
csharp,fg3gi63,t1_fg3crhv,1580480939.0,"I prefer to catch and re-throw exceptions around in my code so that I can log the journey of the exception throughout my application, or ignore the exception as needed (some exceptions you can safely catch and ignore).  I **handle** most of my exceptions in my ViewModel command with a MessageBox to the user.

For example, my EndpointController.Connect method may catch a WebException and log ""Failed to connect to endpoint, throwing exception upstream."" and throws the exception upstream to the ViewModel that made the call to the EndpointController.Connect method, the ViewModel command logs the exception again and shows the messagebox to the user.  I don't want my EndpointController to show a messagebox (it's not close enough to the view to present UI), but I also don't want to hide the fact that an exception occurred within the EndpointController.Connect method."

business,ffuytvh,t1_ffua59w,1580251954.0,"That is actually a big problem.

Most of our news is made to be sensational because no one cares about the mundane.  Capitalists learned long ago that there is money to be made by telling people what they want to hear and calling it news.  It's a very competitive market, and the interest of the people can fade quickly.  But there is an article for pretty much everyone.  There are articles for and against every argument, on every topic, from a variety of outlets.  There are also a lot of biased opinions and advertisements woven in.

And that is just the business model of our big conglomerates, e.g. CNN and Fox.  Many outlets are intentionally peddling non-factual, misleading, and extremely biased opinions.  Many outlets attempt to control how the news is understood (let's hear from the panel to tell you why I'm correct.)  Perhaps then it is deserving that it's getting harder to tell the difference between reputable and satirical news.

People don't verify the content of articles before sharing when the content either already aligns with their personal bias and opinions, or if it comes from a source which they have entered into a trust relationship with.

But let's be real for a second, no one has time to come up with an informed opinion before making quick a rebuttal on the internet.  But rest assured there is an article to validate their uninformed opinion, and it's only a quick Google search away."

Even where it is just decriminalized, there continues to be penalities and stigmas surrounding posession, and cops must continue to intervene in some way if they catch you with it, and so even in those states, people must live in anxiety for choosing to possess a substance.
