germanshepherds,fenomd8,t1_fenjlnt,1579288651.0,My Jax just turned 9 months old and is at 93lbs. Very muscular derp. He is totally unaware of his strength and size. My daughter and gf have a hard time handling him when he acts a fool. I personally like to wrestle with him sometimes.

germanshepherds,fedk238,t1_feaba4m,1579013492.0,"My previous GSD was given to us by an elderly man who became very sick. He was the best dog. Well mannered, calm, gentle with our other animals, loving companion anyone could ask for in a GSD. When he passed we got a 6 month old GSD boy. He has been a handful some days. He can be as calm and loving as our previous dog or as crazy as Satan himself some days. It's all a day in the life of a GSD owner. He is fairly well behaved for me and my daughter, but my gf does not have the patience she needs for him and becomes very frustrated. You will have days where you need to just stop and take a few deep breaths and calm yourself, but in the end they are  in my opinion the best dog out there."

One rocked like no other before or after and one reached into people's hearts through their ear canals with fantastic rhythms, timing and overwhelming solos. It's unfortunate lifelong rock fans like myself will be seeing more and more legends pass now as they reach their twilight. One thing is for sure though people like Neil Peart contributed to some of the best songs ever created in rock in the last 50 years. RIP Neil."

The next morning the skin below the head had swollen to the size of a baseball. I was scared shitless that I was going to have to tell my mother.

germanshepherds,fdb2fnu,t3_ek4o6j,1578252989.0,The dog closest to us has some tree trunks for legs. Stocky dog. Looks younger too almost identical in size and color to my 9 month old. I would love to have 3 of him. Regretting not taking his brother when we got him. The breeder was going to give us two for $1000 since they were 6 months old and nobody was interested.
