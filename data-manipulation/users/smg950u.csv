pcgaming,fev3hnl,t3_eqnoiq,1579392655.0,"I know this isn't the answer you want but ds4windows is pretty good, not ideal, but you are using an ""unsupported"" device by Microsoft and you kinda have to take the wins you get with msoft.

Edit: read your question wrong, ds4w mounts to your pc as a regular old controller, so the fault is probably on the game. The above stands about a ds4 not being an official controller in the eyes of Microsoft, with good reason. Sony broke the standard used by xbox and other usb controllers (flight Sim, racing sim etc), and windows can't really be expected to support that out the box."
pcgaming,fev2wys,t1_feurmgd,1579392549.0,Some devs do tricks to not allow it just to be a pain in the ass. Take all epic store games for example.

razer,feezrsb,t1_fedk9j8,1579044830.0,"I think ff chrome and edge are all in a race to just barely have one feature that another doesn't. Chrome has a bit more in terms of web store/support, Firefox is more driven on privacy and is more resource efficient, edge has better than the rest in windows integration and is pretty fast.... Etc etc. You can't really go that wrong with any of them, and acting like one is superior besides the very minor differences is really just an opinion."
mechanical_gifs,feez4gh,t1_feeyqy4,1579044410.0,"~~Probably in the days of Back to the Future, they did a lot of flying shots with miniatures placed over videos of the real car right when it hit the ground. Nowadays it would be all done in a computer, the movie Dunkirk is a great representation of what can be done in modern times. That while movie has like 10 real extras or something and amazing huge beach shots full of people you can't even notice aren't real.~~

Edit: nevermind. I swear I've heard before that a lot of it was done in CGI, but it sounds like I'm as wrong as the guy that told it to me."
