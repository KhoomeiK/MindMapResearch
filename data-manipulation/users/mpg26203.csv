darkestdungeon,ffdavvr,t1_ffd9ql2,1579816905.0,"Well, thing is, trinkets are very situational. For example, for a vestal, Junia's head is absolutely better than ancestor's map. Every character and every playstyle requires different trinkets, there is no such thing as a best trinket overall.

By the way, why do you think scouting is everything? I mean, sure, it's important, but everything? A surprised party can be a problem but you could just have a dancer party for that if it worries you, it finds traps which is admittedly really important (but ONLY if you are in the cove, traps are a joke everywhere else imo), and I guess finding secret rooms and what every room is for (for example, if it's a boss fight, a curio or a room battle) is important too.

Yes but such an ability is pretty much useless, seeing as how to effectively use bleed, blight, debuffs and marks, you need a party that specializes on it. For example, marks are only useful when you have two or more characters that can deal extra damage to marked enemies. Blight and bleed are great when you have two or more characters that constantly spam it, otherwise they really don't do that much other than to kill enemies with high PROT and low HP.

Not only that but, if I understand correctly, it causes an effect randomly, yes? If so, what if I need to blight an enemy but I mark and debuff him instead? Combat abilities should never be that randomized, they can be randomized but not that much.

The ability you described is so randomized that it's whole purpose is defined by RNG, to the point where it has no clear and solid purpose at all, you just use it and see what happens, the effects could be useful or they could waste a turn, the dice decides. The occultist has RNG, sure, but that RNG ability is always a healing ability regardless of RNG and RNG only decides its effectiveness. This is different, this is just a fundamentally bad idea.

This is just a worse arbalist. It has a gimmick that gives you no reason to use it. You could make it worth using by making all of the effects really powerful, like, deal 10 blight damage at seeker level or something ridiculous like that, but then it would be unbalanced and people would have to put it in just about any team composition just because of the off-chance that it deals some really OP blight and/or bleed damage or cripples the enemy with a debuff so bad that they are dead on arrival."

darkestdungeon,ff24elq,t3_er5aho,1579493501.0,"Okay, the following is a point that almost nobody seems to consider, so here it goes:

The existance of a PvP mode in a game will almost certainly make the community more toxic.

You might be wondering why I think this is the case. The reason why is because I don't think I have ever seen a PvP game without a toxic community, especially not a shooter, but I have seen many shooter games that are not PvP and have a community so great that you could perfectly play for 1000 hours without having a single slur thrown at you, such as Warframe and Deep Rock Galactic. This makes me think that the presence of a PvP mode gives the game a more toxic community. I think this might be either because PvP attracts players that crave a sense of superiority to others and are very toxic (namely 12 year olds who are bullied at school and, generally, people who have very shitty lives), or because PvP being a thing generally makes people salty seeing as how winning and losing against other people becomes a thing, and losing against other people... Well, feels bad, people don't like to feel like losers. Maybe it's both of those reasons.

I've also noticed that multiplayer games without PvP (or with a VERY unpopular and fogotten PvP mode, such as Warframe) tend to have very few cheaters, and I think it's probably because, from my experience, most cheaters are people who enjoy making others salty and angry, which could be for various reasons (source: I used to cheat in online games when I was younger), and they cannot get such a thing in non-PvP games. Basically, cheaters play a different game, where the goal is not to win, but to ruin people's day and laugh your ass of at their reactions and the things thaht they say, and that game is not present in non-PvP games.

There are some games, such as TF2, that have a less toxic community in comparison to other PvP games but they still do have a shitton of toxic people (in the case of TF2 they seem to be all concentrated in Mann Up MVM mode and in community servers, for some reason), and I am pretty sure it's because TF2 is probably one of the least competitive shooter games out there (and, as it turrns out, the Mann Up mode is very competitive because real world money is on the line, and in community servers things tend to get very sweaty and interactions with other players do feel more like you are interacting with a human, mainly because people use chat and voice chat in community servers while they usually don't in casual mode, which I think kinda proves my point, more competitive game = more toxicity)

Taking all of this into account, I just wouldn't wanna risk DD2 having a toxic community, which would also infect DD1, so I'd say no PvP gets a no from me. This community is absolutely great, let's keep it that way. Also, if DD2 ends up being the same type of game as DD1, then there is literally no valid reason for PvP to become a thing.

Most of the points other people have made in this comments section are very valid too if you ask me."

He has a ton of HP and damage but he gets stressed out really easily and has shit speed, which I think makes his HP and damage pretty fair despite being pretty high in comparison to vanilla heroes. Not only that but when he reaches 100 stress, he gets a special affliction called ""aggressive"" which makes him deal more damage and get a few resistances and debuffs, but also he'll sometimes take control of his turn and sometimes he will hit your other heroes, which is a problem because his damage is something to be afraid of.

Also his abilities are very interesting. He can only hit the 2 front rows, so he is a good frontline tank and he is good at killing enemy frontline tanks,

Interesting. I wonder if they patched this out because they noticed people were using the antiquarian like this to make the siren fight trivial.

>Yes. They do use all of their skillset. But most, if not all of the antiquarian's skills focus on self-preservation(Get Down! being a prime example). So the worst she could do is heal the Siren for 1\~2 HP, or give her a meager buff with the force-guard move. Even with all this, I still found her using 'Get Down!' 50% of the time(maybe my memories are biased idk).

I mean, sure, and also the only skills that she has which actually do any damage, are just pitiful, but shouldn't you be worried about fortifying vapors? That dodge buff is huge, to the point where if upgraded and used properly, it can turn the game into a joke, and the siren already has a shitton of dodge, any more of it makes things more difficult, right?

I am sure the bible gives explanations as to the reason why evil exists in the world, but I assume that you are an atheist (If you are not, I apologize for making that assumption) so I won't get into that.

This might sound bad but I think bad things, catastrophes and evil have a place in this world and are necessary for balance, plus they almost always give birth to something good. Just because, say, you are diagnosed with cancer, does not mean God does not exist. Maybe your death will teach someone a valuable lesson, maybe God is testing your faith, maybe you already fulfilled the plan God had for you, maybe you'll survive and give someone else hope, so on and so forth, you don't know that.

I mean, a huge amount of people died in WWII, which is very sad, but WWII also brought countless technological advancements and made a lot of countries realize that wars are not economically viable, and that they should be avoided at all costs, due to the sheer destructive power humanity's inventions have. Were it not for that, I am sure Russia and the USA would have ripped each other apart with nukes decades ago back in the cold war.

Also, the fact that there are problems in the world, gives humans a purpose in life, which might be to either fix them or to overcome them and achieive a goal.

Were the world perfect, everyone would have food and a roof, nobody would have to work, electricity would be infinite and entropy wouldn't be a thing, and we'd have no real reason to do anything other than relax, play videogames and watch movies. Because it would be a perfect world, that lifestyle would not bring any downsides and everyone would be in good health and with good fitness without having to do anything, plus everyone would live forever and not age, which would not be a problem either because space and resources in Earth would be unlimited. It would be nice and all but... Would there be any point in heaven if the earth was literally perfect and nobody ever did anything wrong or died?

The world is not perfect and evil exists in the world, but that does not mean God does not exist. This is my point of view anyways."

Using analogies and parables in an argument, if not done properly (and it's very hard to do it properly), can make you look like a pseudointellectual moron that likes to be cryptic about things. It's best to straight up say what you think and WHY you think it, make valid and elaborate arguments with good reasoning behind them.

It's possible to use them properly and they can help, but your time is better spent building a clear argument.

>We shouldn't just ignore atheists, that's useless and gets you nowhere. We should try to debate, debating is healthy,

See, the thing is that almost nobody knows how to debate properly. There are a ton of different rules and techniques that you NEED to know about if you want to debate anything, and the thing is that almost nobody except for politicians, journalists and other professionals that need it, takes the time to learn about said rules. Sometimes even journalists suck at arguing, despite the fact that it's a huge part of their job (have you ever seen the ""so what you are saying is"" interview? It's atrocious).

A few good examples of those rules would be:

Always be very respectful, never use, say or do anything that resembles an insult or personal attack, anything that could offend the other person or anything that could make them feel like you are talking down to them or insulting their intelligence. For example, ""you are just fucking wrong"" is something you should not say, say ""you are wrong""  instead, it has less weight but, unlike the former option, it does not make the other person feel like this is a fight and not a debate. Don't say ""are you dumb?"", don't say ""you don't understand"" (depending on the context), don't say ""as simple as that"" (depends on the context), the list goes on, it's really not easy in the slightest to know which things are a no, because ""don't use swear words"" is not nearly enough.

Never say anything that could make the other party go in the defensive, because once you do that, it's gonna be impossible to change their mind about anything, they will subconsciously treat this as a fight instead of a debate, their mind will now be closed, and it will all be entirely your fault.

Acknowledge and take into account all of their points or at least pretend that you are doing so, and make sure to never misrepresent what they are saying.

Don't nitpick the other person's semantics or grammar

And those are just a few, there are a ton of those.

>maybe you could change their mind :)

I am sorry but that's an unrealistic expectation. It won't happen, it simply won't, even if you do know how to argue properly. 

Atheists are just as confident in their belief that God does not exist as we christians are confident in our belief that God absolutely does exist.

I am gonna assume that you are a christian. Look at yourself, would anyone be able to switch you from christianity to atheism or any other religion? Chances are, the answer is no. Atheists and people from other religions are in a similar position."

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

No, no it's not. The MC actually has a really deep backstory and personality, plus he is really good at coming up with strategies. The whole concept of ""I am not gonna save the world, I am gonna take care of goblins, which are a problem too"" is really good.

Goblin slayer generally has really good writing and story but people tend to mindlessly say ""lol it's just fanservice and rape"" because of a single scene in the first episode (which by the way, serves the purpose of making people feel disgusted at goblins and I don't think really it's meant to be taken as fanservice), often without actually having watched it.

I mean, I tend to avoid talking mad shit about a topic if I am aware that I don't know a lot about said topic, mainly as to avoid making a fool of myself, but also because it's the logical thing to do. I take a ""well, this is what I think but I might be wrong"" stance instead of an ""I am objectively right"" one if I know I am not an expert, and even in those topics where I think I am an expert, I try to be very polite when expressing why I think I am right.

In an argument, debate, conversation or discussion or any kind, the goal is to exchange information, not piss off the other party, make them feel bad somehow or flex your perceived knowledge about a topic, and to achieve the goal, you just cannot ever be an asshole towards the other person, nor can you insult them, their arguments or their opinions. If you disagree with their arguments and opinions, say so politely and explain why, and you better have some good reasoning behind it.

I have no idea why but a lot of people here on Reddit, despite getting into arguments all the time, are completely unaware of all this.

Animemes,fej5vei,t1_fej4gkh,1579158137.0,">That explains a lot. Gender identity and sexual orientation are separate. Trans people can be straight, gay, bisexual, asexual, or whatever.

I totally know all of that, except ""trans people can be straight, gay, bisexual or asexual"", I did not know that, I always kinda thought they were like the other sex in every way, including sexual orientation.

>So I want to preface what I'm about to say by stating that I am ***NOT*** calling you transphobic. But this argument is used literally word-for-word by transphobic people as a way to justify bigotry and hatred. I'm not throwing any flack your way, you said you wern't familiar with transgender topics so I don't think you meant any ill will. But be aware in the future that there are some people where that sentence will push a lot of wrong buttons. They've probably heard it said by some very not-nice people and painful memories could easily surface.

I understand, thanks for the heads up.

By the way, in the thread that you linked, everyone is giving really valid arguments as to whether or not Felix is or is not trans, and after reading the arguments of both sides in that thread for a while, I think the actual canon conclusion to this whole topic is that Felix is not canonically trans and that his girly behavior, along with the whole ""I am a cute and girly girl"" thing, are a product of his relationship with Crusch, along with personal preference, and not a product of his sexual orientation.

As I said before, feel free to think that he is trans, there is nothing wrong with wanting some representation, but canonically he is not trans.

He didn't say he identifies as a woman, he said ""I am a cute girlish woman"" (According to you because I don't really remember that from the anime, would you mind linking a clip? Thanks), which does not mean he identifies as one, nor does it mean he has gender dysphoria. Straight cis males can say that too. I am a straight cis male and I sometimes say that kind of thing as a joke when I am with my male friends. People say a lot of things, that does not make them true.
