AskReddit,femeykn,t1_felwxan,1579251988.0,"NOAA:  The birds are also the origin of the infamous chem trails, which actually are cloud controlling sprays released to manipulate rainfall. 

By controlling rain, you can 1) better grow your crops of drugs for the pigeons and 2) cause flooding so your enemies are swept away and black mold grows in damaged buildings, especially centers of radio, television, wire, satellite and cable companies. Now you control communications, and the FCC shows up, too!

Mwuhahahahaha!!!"

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,felapeu,t3_epl7kd,1579217769.0,"This is from memory, so I may not be 100% on minor details, but the meat is honest and true.

Years ago (late 90s, early 00s?), two ""hoarder"" houses in Waukesha county, Wisconsin, relinquished hundreds of animals, I think thru the deaths of the elderly hoarders. 

Of course, many of the cats and dogs had not had proper care, so after all were cleaned up and made as healthy as possible, there were a lot of missing parts and scars.

One of the local humane societies (maybe Elmbrook????) brilliantly held a ""Scratch and Dent Sale."" I remember a lot of advertising on PBS.

It worked. People all across the US (literally as far away as Washington state) applied to adopt these ""slightly used"" pets. 

Years later, I was told by a new acquaintance who had applied for one of those babies that a local shelter assisted in the adoption process, and if an animal that had already been adopted was asked about by someone far away, the Wisconsin shelter referred the people back to those local shelters. I have no reason to doubt what that woman told me, and I did see a picture of her three legged, one and a half eared cat.

If shelters don't work together like this already, IMHO, they should.

Good luck, Jubilee. I hope you find your happy home."
