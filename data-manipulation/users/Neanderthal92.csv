offmychest,ff433rv,t1_ff3yt1x,1579554491.0,"Obviously I don't share your exact situation, but I sympathise with much of what you're saying. I've had those dreams too, about people I'd rather forget, and I know how much it fucks you up in the morning. The best advice I have is to allow yourself some time to feel your emotions (realistic dreams can be overwhelming, especially when they include details you thought you'd forgotten), then let go as best you can. It sounds like you're already making great progress, so I wish you all the best."

offmychest,ff3un5c,t3_ergl41,1579549219.0,"Jeez this hit me hard in the feels. I don't know what to say,but if you need someone to talk to DM me. I hope you're doing okay."
offmychest,ff2u72y,t3_erca44,1579524326.0,"I had one of these many years ago. Watch out for the 'false calm' and love-bombing once you confront him and tell him you're  breaking up - once he starts feeling the pressure he's going to amp up his manipulation to max, and he's going to try to get to you however he possibly can. Stay strong and remember you made the right decision. Wishing you all the best."

offmychest,fezzpaj,t1_fezmglz,1579463631.0,"I love this, well said."
offmychest,fd9g80q,t3_ekd5lu,1578232964.0,I'm happy for you and I'm glad that you're feeling the love from those closest you :)

AskReddit,fc4y7e7,t1_fc4f19z,1577433580.0,Big oof.
offmychest,fbqxj91,t3_ee6ipn,1577036693.0,That's truly wonderful. I hope you all have a very merry Christmas.
