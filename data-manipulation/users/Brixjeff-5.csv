Switzerland,ff33sgg,t1_ff2wz3q,1579532949.0,"Just go stargazing one evening, preferably as far away from light pollution as possible! If you see a point slowly moving in the sky, about as fast as a jetliner but not blinking, you’re looking at a satellite. Shooting stars on the other hand are much brighter and very much faster. 

The ISS for example is clearly visible even in bigger urban areas, and it’s easy to check online to see when and where to look for it.

Also wanted to mention that the next batch of 60 StarLink satellites launch tomorrow, so expect to be able to see a line in the sky again soon. Check r/spacex or r/starlink for more info."

how do you suppose they would do that? You can see satellites all the time if you look a bit, StarLink sats just have the particularity of flying in close formation"

facepalm,fekrb0q,t1_fekptny,1579205985.0,"Of course it’s arbitrary, like any other system of measurement that isn’t based on physical constants of the universe (like the Planck unit of distance or time). A nautical mile is also an arbitrary distance, because the size of the earth is arbitrary. It’s not even consistant with reality because it is based on the assumption that the earth is a perfect sphere, which it is not. (This does not matter if you’re the captain of a ship, but it does if you’re trying to design a GPS device, for instance)

A meter is however an arbitrary distance in an useful way, because it corresponds to human scale. You can extend your arms, or walk two steps, and say “this is about one meter”. Then you can take one tenth of that distance, make a cube of it, fill it with water and call it’s mass one kilogram. These two considerations, with the consistency of the base 10 and the scale which fits well into everyday life, makes metric a super useful system of measurement, in comparison to imperial anyway. 

But if you get into the specifics, it is still basically an arbitrary scale, which is why in specific situations one may prefer another system of measurements. However, this is not an argument in favor of imperial measurements, because those are even more arbitrary and inconsistent amongst each other."

facepalm,fekchgg,t1_fek7h5v,1579197167.0,"In the real world, but only in navigation. And that is only because these two were specifically designed for it: a NM is the distance on the surface of the earth corresponding to an angle of one arc-second, taken at the center of the earth, and the knot is a unit of speed derived from the NM. This makes computing and planning ship routes somewhat easier (especially in the old days, without calculators or computers) but it’s really the only case in which it’s useful. 

It’s also used for air travel because using the definition above, a nautical mile for an aircraft at 33,000ft (10km) is less than half a meter longer than the one for a ship sailing on waters below. 

I know that I’m going to break the circlejerk here, but the use of nautical miles instead of metric isn’t even the only case of alternative measurement systems being used instead of SI, because it makes more sense. Quantum physicists for instance will rather use electronvolts (eV) rather than joules for their calculations, because it makes more sense to use those to compute the behavior of really small particules. But that’s about the only reason to use eV (unless you like really large numbers)

I guess what I wanted to say is that there are many “real world” applications in which there are better measurement systems than SI, but those are usually really specific, and have a measurement system that only makes sense in those precise cases. My guess is that you, as an average redditor, aren’t going to be in a situation in which the SI system isn’t the one that makes the most sense."
