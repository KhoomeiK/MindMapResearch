PrequelMemes,ffgx0ou,t1_ffguy3v,1579917222.0,That's why we don't see him anymore in movies. He probably made a boatload of money.
SubredditDrama,ffgvesx,t1_ffg9pva,1579916046.0,"Trolling has become defined, to me, as ""temporarily giving up pieces of your moral compass for attention""

The level they are willing to give up just varies."

phoenix,ffgmqk1,t1_ffg3w59,1579909837.0,I really appreciate the whole mod team here and every thing you all do. But you (in particular) really need to find another way to talk to people you don't like in your home town sub. Its cringy.
OutOfTheLoop,ffgkk77,t1_ffgg0dv,1579908364.0,It's very easy to not be a trabsphobic jerk. It's nearly impossible to not come off as one at some point unless you ignore talking about it. It's a weird time but I've even been attacked online when I thought I was supporting the LGBTQ community. Then I got attacked. Then another LGBTQ supporter attacked that person about what they said. It's ALWAYS a shit show. It's a weird time.
OutOfTheLoop,ffgka4f,t1_fffqt9s,1579908178.0,No. People on the Twitter left do. Most of the left agrees with Joe and is happy to have him endorse Bernie.
OutOfTheLoop,ffgk3ra,t1_ffg23wf,1579908061.0,It's only controversial on Twitter.

phoenix,ffecmuk,t1_ffdpkqh,1579843206.0,"Big truck with flashy lights breaking traffic laws easier sight when going right speed. BIG TRUCK TOO FAST. SMALL TRUCK NO REACT IN TIME. Talk like this big asshole thing when referring to people dead.


There's so many things that could have happened. Two people screwed up and something really tragic happened. Unfortunately one of the people who screwed up is dead so he can't exactly be in the conversation of punishment. Treat people with respect."

DotA2,ff5cwo7,t1_ff5cep8,1579587692.0,Yes he did know. I asked him to cool it and he doubled down and said some really inhumane things. This was the first time I just didn't want to be in the same game as someone who talks like that because of the degree. I feel bad for the 3 other people but it just wasn't worth going backwards on very expensive therapy. Luckily I'm not banned because this was a first on my account from 2013.

DotA2,ff4oy84,t3_erm6mw,1579568931.0,I was just there until in a moment of weakness I let slip to my Monkey King that despite his insult my mom's actually dead. He spent the next five minutes focusing on this and I just had to leave the game. Great Community DotA. I love being a support player.

atheism,ff1tzp9,t1_ff0f896,1579486147.0,The atheists are allowed to speak on behalf of their religion and quoted the book of Satan during their equally allotted time in Phoenix recently. Republicans are pissed and don't want them to have the same rights as Christians during political events. It's hilarious.
