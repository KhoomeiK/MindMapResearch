BisexualMen,ffg5tgb,t1_fffhpff,1579899082.0,"I'm in this exact boat myself. My girl is actually the one who suggested it to me. She knows I am into being pegged and am a bottom, but doesn't want to do any of that stuff for me and has actively been encouraging me to find a dude to satisfy that for me and explore. (Haven't been with a dude yet but been pegged plenty of times in the past) being my first time with a dude I feel a large amount of pressure and am not quite sure where to even begin. I get attention when we go out to the gay bars and clubs, even gotten a few numbers. But nothing that really clicks yet."

I love those, blended fruit, low in sugar and calories and high in protein, I eat one with my breakfast every day, between that, oatmeal and a protein shake I have 55g of protein in my first meal of the day. 

Also the store brand equivalent one is great too, and depending on the price and grocery money for the week I switch between the two brands."

Honestly an e cig kept the cravings and irritability of nicotene withdrawal at Bay. It was a few weeks and I didn't even want a regular cig, 6 months and when I tried a normal cig it tasted terrible and I put it out. 

It was no perfect fix, but I used it as a crutch to help me get through the hard parts."
