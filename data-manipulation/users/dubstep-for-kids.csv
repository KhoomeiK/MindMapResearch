LeftTheBurnerOn,ffwi8vf,t1_ffw69l6,1580301905.0,"During the peak of Fortnite and the rise of Ceeday (a fortnite meme youtuber creator) his viewers asked him to watch some of his videos. And he got really mad saying ""No I dont want to watch his videos I just want to play"" and the people weren't even being annoying it was just something that lasted like 5 minutes and he then asked the mods to ban anyone who said ""Ceeday"" for a say. Then he said ""No you know what? Perma ban them I am done"". Perma banned his own viewers who weren't being actually annoying but only agree with themselves to try to convince him to watch Ceeday. 

Another situation that happened is not that long ago. He started complaining about the current situation of the game. He tweeted ""This game is trash"" and he got responded by Ninja saying literally something like ""just play another game dude"". Now I dont know the real intentions of Ninja but for me it wasn't something DK should have ranted about and called him out during his livestream even to the extend of blocking him on twitter.

Tbh I agree with ninja, if you dont like a game just dont play it. I started disliking fortnite so I gravitated to other games like Modern Warfare and Siege. Ninja didnt actually do nothing wrong but it is true he should have minded his own business."
