Im done arguing with someone that clearly view animals as objects. I'm not expecting everyone to love or even like animals. You just don't have to hurt them."
todayilearned,ffeonp0,t1_ffenwnu,1579857664.0,"No. But let's compare humans living in a developed society to wildlife animals. Totally comparable.

Can I use the same argument to justify rape? Lions also eat their babies. Can I also do that? I know its illegal, but people shouldn't be outraged about it imo.

You get the difference, right? One thing is out of our control. The other is not... 

I dont blame people for finding it hard to cut out animal products of their diet when it has been so normal to them. But defending the abuse and torture the animals go through is disgusting. You just end up lying to yourself."
todayilearned,ffenoar,t1_ffelx9p,1579856182.0,Imagine caring about animal cruelty.
AmItheAsshole,ff9p0rg,t1_ff9lhqa,1579717678.0,"OP already put effort into it, but didn't want to put even more effort into it. What the hell are you on about?"
AmItheAsshole,ff9kfn7,t1_ff9jdlp,1579714885.0,"Well, it definitely would make you closer to an asshole if you knew you were having multiple vegetarians coming over to eat, and you dont tell them that you wont make anything without meat. This does not goes both ways like you think it does... 

I would never call anyone out for being lazy if they made food for me that I can eat either. I would appreciate the effort the host put into it, instead of being immature and calling the host out for not putting in even more effort."
AmItheAsshole,ff9hxoa,t1_ff9hl3d,1579713394.0,"Yeah, OP could have done that, but OP already said he/she didnt want to. How hard is that to grasp? 

I don't hate meat eaters at all. I just dislike when people pretend they cant eat a vegetarian/vegan meal as an omnivore."
AmItheAsshole,ff9h1f4,t1_ff9gft2,1579712846.0,"You clearly dont get the point. So killing 1 animal is just as bad as killing hundreds? Reducing harm doesnt matter to you? Jesus..

I know alot of vegans that spend less money now than what they did before they went vegan. You control how much you spend on food yourself."
AmItheAsshole,ff9gr5j,t1_ff9g86h,1579712670.0,"The host only wanted to make the vegetarian atlernative because it was more convenient. So he/she should have only made the meat alternative instead then? So the vegetarians should either have to eat that or dont eat at all? Why cant meat eaters just suck it up for a meal? Like I said, if you HAVE to have meat in every single meal, you should inform people beforehand, or change your terrible habits.

It's not only one person thats vegetarian in this scenario either."
AmItheAsshole,ff9flk7,t1_ff9d128,1579711965.0,"Do you know why alot of you omnis see it this way? Because it makes it easier for you to continue your bad habits by making the ones that are trying to do good be the ""bad/weird ones"". Not necessarily conscious, but it's easy to jump on that train.

 I know it can be hard to look at something that you have done your whole life as unethical, but if you try to be a bit more open minded about it, and educate yourself, you will see it differently.  Thats what I did. I've always been against animal cruelty, but I never really saw how animal agriculture was exactly that until last year. Now I align my actions with my morals, and if the majority of humans did that, omnivores would be the outliers, not the vegans."
AmItheAsshole,ff93tx5,t1_ff8ziky,1579704179.0,"Virtue signaling? Really? 
You clearly don't know much about this topic if you seriously mean that. 

It's funny when omnis try to make vegans look bad cause they aren't willing to give up animal products."
AmItheAsshole,ff8yul4,t1_ff8wnz5,1579700409.0,"Veganism is not about being perfect. Its about doing whats practicable and what kills the least amount of animals. And it doesn't involve enslaving, torturing, and slaughtering trillions of animals globally every year.

Growing crops for livestock also does alot more damage than what is used for humans."
AmItheAsshole,ff8qlx1,t1_ff7l2vy,1579692007.0,"That's not comparable at all. Omnivores don't think its immoral to eat plants, but vegans think its immoral to kill animals when we don't have to. It's actually that simple.

If you can't eat a meal without meat (you can), you should specify that before you make someone else make food for you. Just like if you have an allergy or if you are vegeterian or vegan."
TrueOffMyChest,fcuocth,t1_fcuoaer,1577985251.0,Sometimes it's hard to tell. Sorry.
TrueOffMyChest,fcuo5au,t1_fcu1anp,1577985135.0,Lets come up with terrible examples to justify animal abuse. Great.
TrueOffMyChest,fctzkf2,t1_fctrb1d,1577967188.0,"How is this garbage of a comment upvoted?

Imagine comparing plants to animals. You are insane."
soccer,fcqt0zf,t1_fcqsrga,1577891758.0,You are insane if you think thats a dive.
soccer,fcqt097,t1_fcqsnw6,1577891750.0,Dive? are you fucking mad
soccer,fcqmzma,t3_eihvlg,1577888855.0,CHO is a fraud. The fact that he hasn't scored in the premier league yet is shocking.
soccer,fburld0,t1_fbtpz3v,1577119243.0,Like it wasn't a freak accident. Jesus christ.
