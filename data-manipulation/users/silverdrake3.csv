Once I get my own shit under control i'll apply for MH Tech. Gotta remember to take those mental health days instead of ""toughing it out""."
Dudeism,fgm9tc1,t3_ez86oo,1580920578.0,"I'm kind of working on the same thing. I've been a Donny for way too long (occasionally with frantic self-hating episodes that don't really have a character I can reference) so stress levels tend to be high.

I try to set myself up so I'm surrounding myself with things that make me happy and content, and discarding things that don't whenever possible. This is much like the Dude's sparse apartment-- he's got his rug, Caucasian ingredients, and is otherwise fairly minimalist.

I also do things, again, that make me content and happy. Enjoying the company of my dog, for example. Tea is definitely a favorite of mine, especially when combined with video games or a good video. I like [nature](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCONd1SNf3_QqjzjCVsURNuA) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Nj4gkoi_n5eCcrKCVOXKA), [letsplays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioOMe7NDn9ko2H0hiKLHeQ), and I've recently gotten into [bonsai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxWc7cn-M-22gie8oPslLcA). All very enjoyable things that work for me, and that's what matters.

Take it easy."

CPTSD,fgjndj3,t3_eyu0gz,1580847599.0,"When I have a bad day at work, on the way home I go to a thrift store and pick out one nice (<$10) thing, even if it's candy from next to the register.

Not much, but I love browsing thrift stores so it's nice."
ptsd,fgguwj6,t1_fgfst7p,1580770107.0,"Yeah, I saw that one in the related links. I'm having a hard time grokking the tips tho. My supportive ppl can't always be available, and I'm working in a job where you can't ignore the boss's requests for even a minute. I'm scared i'll get ""set off"" again next time I screw something up and get fired."

I've been trying to stop fawning as much, but it's so hard. I feel like I'm coming across as obnoxious or, worse, an ""attention whore"" (long story). Even saying ""no"" is monumentally hard because I end up being very waffley about it, using ""uh"" and ""I don't think I..."" so it's super easy for someone to bulldoze me and get their way regardless.

Self-blame is another big one, often turning into self-harm.

Dissociating in social situations, yup, got that in spades. I get fixated on where I should look. Should I look at their eyes? No, no, that just feels like suffocating and what if I stare like a creep? Their forehead? Their hands? Their clothes? The wall behind them? Wait, what were they talking about?

So, yeah. Any suggestions welcome. I'm so tired of this."
