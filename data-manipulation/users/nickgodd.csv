EscapefromTarkov,ffckh51,t1_ffck44n,1579801376.0,"Yeah but regardless if the sight is centered in its housing or not, if your optic is zeroed correctly it should still shoot where you put the dot. I know what you mean because I’ve seen it as well on certain sights but it doesn’t take away from wether or not it’s zeroed."
EscapefromTarkov,ffck075,t1_ffcish0,1579801092.0,"Yeah, we all hate it.. it’s stupid and pointless and it’s been pointed out a million times in the subreddit. If people just searched these posts wouldn’t pop up multiple times a day."

EscapefromTarkov,ff9pq9y,t1_ff9paih,1579718198.0,"Night raids are definitely a plus one! Unfortunately learning the game at night definitely isn’t suggested. Try running interchange or woods.. I personally learned the game by playing on woods. The scav interactions are more predictable and geared players tend to farm the boss. 

Also check which servers you’re connecting to. At night since I’m on the east coast I’ll connect to European servers and I get instant queue times pretty much. When you’re in the launcher you can find the server list right above where you click to launch the game."
EscapefromTarkov,ff8wdh3,t1_ff8wbf9,1579698282.0,I feel your pain.. try going in solo then you’ll have an easier chance getting in than with an entire 4 or 5 man

EscapefromTarkov,fdqqs4a,t3_emr1gn,1578672878.0,This energy system is for when the game is complete and one whole map. It’s not even a big deal and if it is- bring some food and water in.

EscapefromTarkov,fdm1kir,t1_fdjy4cp,1578537622.0,What about late spawns? Raids where you spawn in a few minutes in. No different than loading in late.

You’ll learn a lot about what battles you want to pick, how big sound actually matters in this game, and you’ll die. A LOT. But you’ll get a lot better at the game faster because you’re not relying on your teammates so much."

relationship_advice,fdi3pin,t3_elf8xd,1578435185.0,"What’s on the lease is what they have to go by, they signed a legal document and are expecting you to go out of your way so you can help them out and they’re being dicks to you. Your boyfriend is also a dick. You’re being completely reasonable by helping out saying you’re moving out mid lease. They overstepped their boundaries and next time they go into the space that you’re renting out without your consent you have every right to call the authorities over it because it’s against the law."
