Meanwhile, the only people in Japan were women and children, the sick and the elderly. They trained children to fight with bamboo stakes. They were lacking in every kind of military hardware. The American bombers were coming in waves of hundreds at a time, without suffering a single plane lost to enemy fire. 

There might have been guerilla skirmishes in the mountains, but there was no way the Japanese could have mounted anything near a credible defense. Give the course of the war another year, and they'd all be dead anyway. They were starving, and half were sleeping in the open.

LOL, I should write a book about it. Long story short: I've been fascinated by ""electronic brains"" since childhood. Got my first computer in 1982. Learned to program, and became obsessed with it.  Even earlier, the idea of ""electronic bulletin boards"" were on my mind. I literally discovered the internet in 1989 after getting an account on a machine at the local university. I became so focused on getting Usenet to work, I spent months at it, and should have kept a journal, but didn't. Anyway, the web was being proposed around that time. 

In 2005, I was developing a software for my own use, a way of keeping and curating websites that could be shared and commented upon, that would live on the web. So you could access your bookmarks from someone else's computer. AKA a ""social bookmarking"" site. 

Anyway, I was looking for examples of social bookmarking sites, and that's how I found Reddit. From a software POV, I'm pretty well pleased with how Reddit works. It's avoided/solved some of the problems that plagued Usenet. 

OTOH, Usenet was open-source and used distributed servers. One of the unexpected things about how public networking evolved on the internet is how it's become so centralized. It's ironic. Back in the sixties, when some of us knew that the public would have terminals at home, we had 'mainframe mentality', because computers were so huge and expensive. Time sharing was the norm. When the microcomputers came along, and the topology of the internet was in place that allowed and encouraged wide distribution of server resources, we have instead gone ""back to the future"", and are basically watching TV, fed to us from huge server farms, that eat way more energy than ever -- when we thought microcomputers would save energy. 

Still gung-ho on open source, and would like to see some good efforts put into replacing some of the Big Internet Corporations with open source, distributed applications. We were looking for more democracy, after all... not centralized power."

The Boeing SST was much larger than the Concorde, and during its development, there was one compromise after another. It started as a fixed wing, then became a swing wing aircraft. The bearings that held the wings weighed more than the payload. The thing was a mess. 

I had a close relative who worked on the project as one of the chief engineers. He loved it, but I could see all kinds of problems. They really didn't know how to build the damn thing to fit their promised capabilities. E.g. it didn't have windows, for reasons of strength. I argued that passengers won't like it. Years after the project was abandoned, I was told that it *would* have windows... :)   

Being so much larger and heavier, the sonic boom ruled out any flights over populated areas. New York to Los Angeles in quicktime was not going to happen. The SSTs were only useful for trans oceanic flights -- and they killed fish with their sonic boom all along the way. 

Around 1980, a Concorde was based in Honolulu, that took passengers on late afternoon flights to the east, into the night, then back to Honolulu where they could watch the sun set for a second time. That would have been pretty neat if you had $1,500 (iirc) to spend.

Before the nudity ordinance, the club had other problems with not being allowed to serve alcohol. There was a bar right next door to the place. 

FWIW, the ordinance went into effect around 2001, and there were protests at a few local art galleries, in which nude models took part. Those places weren't hassled.

There used to be a passenger boat named ""Idaho"" that ran up the Columbia river to the gold fields in what is now Idaho. That seems to be the most accepted theory locally. 

There was also a real estate development in Colorado called ""Idaho"", that changed its name when the Idaho Territory became official. 

I was taught in grade school that it was a Shoshone word meaning ""behold the sun rising over the mountains"".

OldSchoolCool,fesvj5a,t1_fesigv5,1579369444.0,"When they started doing it, yes. There would be a supervising artist who would colorize a key frame, then worker-bees would use something like a paint bucket tool to colorize individual frames, item by item in the scene, according to the colors set by the supervisor. It was extremely labor intensive. 

That was in the early 90s, but vision technology has come a very long way since then. 

Something that was unexpectedly cool when I first saw it is the fact that when you 'tint' a black and white object with color, the shading is automatic. I saw that in an exhibit of colorized black and white photographs of flowers. The artist had put watercolor over the black and white, and all it took to bring a grey rose to life, was a single shade of red. So it's actually a bit easier than you'd think to colorize a single colored object like a flower or a car or a building. For patterns, ouch."

You obviously care about him. Rapist, rapist, rapist...

What I'm suggesting is that maybe Tarantino wanted to rub it in. Forget the murders. Did not happen. Polanski is ONLY a rapist. It's the ONLY thing that matters, right? Hate him, remind him of his loss. Make a joke out of it.  because you ""care"" about ""the rapist"". LOL.

So the Manson murders didn't happen. Next, a movie about the Holocaust, and how that didn't happen, either. Because you care."
