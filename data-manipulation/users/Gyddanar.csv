Parahumans,fevggrc,t1_fegjrgu,1579397087.0,I wonder how many meanings of cleave we're working with here then.
Parahumans,fetavj3,t1_fet9ju1,1579373447.0,"Yeah, the core problem their power is trying to fix is the function of their relationship.

This means that as their relationship changes, so too does their association to their power.

And they *can't* ignore or let their relationship be either.

It could also be that 'change' is a concept key to their power. That any power coming from that shard 'flower' would be very, very easily variable. Perhaps with the aim of analysing how a host handles a changing tool, rather than taking the 'all I have is my consistent hammer' approach that, for example, Sting might have."
AskReddit,fet4emu,t1_fesjmyu,1579371744.0,"Can't remember precise sources off top of my head, but I studied this in Uni.

Basically, in what is now modern-day Turkey's north-west coast, they discovered ruins of several cities stacked on top of each other. (Wilusa, as someone else mentioned)

Those which had been sacked/fell to war, likely had been attacked by raiders from what is now Greece, called the Sea Peoples. This matches up to the fact that in myth, Greek heroes attacked and destroyed Troy at least twice.

It's not likely that the whole Helen of Troy thing happened, but we have found evidence from the Hittite empire of a treaty existing between the Hittites and a Wilusan king called Alexander (name latinised). Alexander was the 'true' name of Paris of Troy, who Helen ran off with.

Off the top of my head, the true motivation for proto-Greeks to war with/attack 'Troy', was that 'Troy' controlled access to the Black Sea. The land around the Black Sea was/is super-fertile. Greece is not really. So free trade/access to the Black Sea was super helpful for Ancient Mediterranian wealth.

Again, apologies. Writing this off my phone, so going off memory rather than re-writing/copy-pasting one of my old essays.

EDIT: TL; DR: Trojan War as in myth likely didn't happen. However it is very likely that there were real-world events that got turned into/memorialised through oral history/spiced up into Homer's version"
Parahumans,fesyxrc,t1_fest51m,1579370303.0,"For Chris/Labrat, I think you can mine his ""I'm a changer"" deal for a lot.

It's how he wishes his power worked. Chris believes everyone is a monster, under the human mask, and his main motivation in life is to remove that mask.

The irony for Chris, is that the more he uses and applies his tinker power, the more he helps. The more he, in his uniquely fucked up way, improves things. So he's a human wearing a monster mask so to speak. He deeply, deeply wants to be pure-and-simple monstrous."

If it is something the system sees as something anyone can do (perception more important here than reality) or if the system does not value it, then it receives less money.
