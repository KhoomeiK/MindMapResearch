ADHD,ffiv0ck,t1_ffgqm5f,1579983393.0,"Yes he is free roaming but that’s not ideal. Tortoises are notorious for attempting to go from A to B through the most inconvenient and dangerous way for them possible. 

For example: Shelly is currently and temporarily set up on the floor in my living room out in the open during the process of overhauling my house. He has a dog bed set on a towel with blankets over top of everything. Next to this I have a reptile lamp stand with his UVB lamp and a ceramic heat lamp that isn’t a light. The lamp stand is C shaped so it’s designed to slide the base under a reptile tank. In other words, it has to be weighed down or it’ll flip. Mine was weighed down with a Dewalt drill box. 

My roommate, who is home sick, checked on him at 2 PM yesterday and didn’t hear anything amiss the rest of the day till I got home from work. I came in to the living room to find Shelly on his back completely covered in his own poop. The lamp was turned over and there’s a burn mark on the wood floor. 

Shelly got a scrubbing bath. His area was dismantled for washing with new towels put down for him after a thorough mopping of the floor. And a plate of food put next to his bed.

What does he do? He decides the best way around his bed is through the narrow passage between TV stand and the lamp stand that he’s not going to fit through. To make himself fit he shoves the drill box aside. I had to race to catch everything before the lamp stand catapulted him back into the position he was in earlier. Mystery solved. And now the lamps and the stand are in another room till I figure out a better set up. Instead he’s got the electric fireplace to keep his area warm. Even then, he’s decided to nap elsewhere where there’s a draft. 

When this overhaul is done, I’m setting him up behind the couch. There’s about a foot and a half wide gap between the back of the couch and the wall making a protected on 3 sides niche about 3 or 4 feet in length just for him. I’m looking forward to that. 

That was my Friday night! I told all the babies, “I swear if I don’t get something really awesome for Mother’s Day!” 

I love animals too. It’s a lot of work. Very similar to dealing with a room full of toddlers. You can’t be shy around bodily functions. You will experience poo in all it’s forms and range of smells. I wish you luck!"
ADHD,ffiqtaf,t3_etkdzt,1579980407.0,"Ugh!! Thank you!! Someone else who has clearly made this speech like a broken record!! 

There is no “squared away”! There is no cure! There is no one instant magical foolproof solution that works for everyone permanently!! The medication doesn’t work that way! Doing everything for me while helpful also makes me co-dependent!! Running in like a knight of shiny check books to save the crisis in 24 hours or less does not permanently solve the real problem that caused the issue to get to the point of crisis level!  

Continuously saving the day voluntarily because you feel obligated to and then complaining about the cost and the inconvenience is not the motivator for self-sufficiency you think it is. And don’t look at me horrified and confused as to where I could have possibly gotten the idea that you think I’m a burden after the fact. I’ll just say the same thing you tell me all the time, “use your brain!” 

Yes I am smart! Yes I am capable! Stop acting like I’m not when you’re scared of me messing up! 

I am not complaining about my “condition” when I tell you about my symptoms and how they affect me! I am telling you to be patient and give me some leeway while I struggle to figure things out! There will probably be more crisis while I do that so don’t get all pissy and have a Vietnam flashback when it happens!!! 

You want this process to go more smoothly? Great! Let’s brainstorm a viable way around this together like adults! Too much of an inconvenience on your precious time? You’d rather stand there and bitch like a “judgy McJudgy Pants”? Don’t get all bent out of shape when another expensive crisis happens then!

Yes I’ve had this conversation many times as well... And they never retain any of this information like next week all these issues are going to magically change."
aww,ffbirre,t3_eslt2p,1579767230.0,George is proud of himself. As those named George tend to be. My dad and my nephew are both named George.
AnimalsBeingJerks,ff6lons,t1_ff6939c,1579629859.0,"Lol Both. Lions are very family oriented. They get very attached to their pride members. That said, male lions are also very territorial. Females stay within their birth pride. Once young males get to a certain age though, they become a threat to the dominant male of the pride. They get kicked out. Brothers usually stick together in coalitions to challenge the dominant male of another pride and eventually have their own family with them. If the females of that pride are particularly attached to the males they currently have, they fight with them for the sake of their pride."
AnimalsBeingJerks,ff5p9f7,t3_erqtdh,1579604420.0,Aw those boys are still young! They’re probably their own coalition at this point. Probably got kicked out of their home pride and their banding together to find their own pride. They barely have manes yet. Either way lions are so squishy with each other. Sleeping in a pile is nothing new lol. Easier to keep track of everyone that way and lions are just the huggy type of families.

ADHD,ff3hvef,t3_elf15j,1579541372.0,"These are all wonderful tips! Thank you!

I spoke to one of my coworkers who I chat with about this stuff all the time. She has anxiety issues that she’s being treated for and her husband has ADHD. He’s also a teacher and a tech nerd and a cross country coach. 

We determined that what I really need that I don’t have is a means of accountability. I’m not good at doing the self reward thing because all the rewards I can think of are too practical and inexpensive so what’s stopping me from just going out and getting it. 

My roommate and I are already analyzing what stops us from doing things we should be doing and possible ways to arrange things to get around those mental obstacles. 

My family is very helpful in a lot of ways, but they also have no chill or sense of boundaries. They are very accustomed to their own routines and their own houses being as clean and organized as something out of a magazine. So it’s difficult for them to wrap their head around a household that doesn’t naturally fall into a workable routine automatically. So it’s difficult for them to effectively help me with accountability because they’re too easily frustrated.

I tend to be more responsible at work. There are things I can do at work that would just be a distraction at home. We have a wellness program at work, but our wellness program focuses more on diet and fitness. They don’t have any way to monitor changes in home routine. And my coworkers are busy with their own stuff to consciously commit to helping a fellow coworker with something like that.

However, that said my coworkers are also very nosy. Asking them to do something is inconvenient, but setting something out for them to just happen to notice and comment on is not inconvenient. It’s weird how that’s a thing.

I’m setting up a portion of my cubicle wall for before and after pictures of things I want to work on in my house. And a section for proof that an area I already worked on is still in good shape. I’m setting that up on a wall at home too so when I get accused of not doing anything I have digital proof to the contrary.

At work I’m titling it “Detoxing the house” and at home it’s “exorcising the house”. I’m thinking of decorating it with sage and holy water. Maybe a ring of salt."
ADHD,febwli6,t3_eo7qrc,1578963542.0,"Sorry I break was over and I’m not allowed to touch my cellphone during work hours.

I’m very used to having to explain this to people because my situation is bat-sh** crazy complicated.

I work Monday through Friday 8-5. My job is probably the worst possible job for someone with ADD. It’s monotonous, highly stressful, repetitive, mind numbing, and highly detailed with lots of exceptions to rules of procedure and procedures are subject to change suddenly and frequently. My department also has a tendency to get blamed for everything even things we don’t take care of. I work for the county Clerk Of Courts. I am one of 4 processing clerk deputies for the Civil Department. We’re like house elves. The judges have no idea who we are and have never actually met us. We do not set foot in the courtroom at all. We hide in a cubicle all day typing over 100 words per minute. All the judges know is all their paperwork magically gets done somehow and there is a person somewhere who does this. By the time I get home I’m mentally exhausted from trying to focus on my work all day. I’m usually ready to crash as soon as I get home.

I have a roommate. Yes she helps, but her situation prevents her from being as helpful as she would like to be and certainly not as helpful as other people expect her to be. She has Bipolar 1, severe anxiety, depression, PTSD and OCD. She has almost daily migraines with aura. Her hip bone is uneven so she’s naturally off balance. This has caused her to have spinal issues. She has joint issues, a very susceptible immune system, partial hearing impairment, chronic bronchial issues...I could go on. She does not have a driver’s license for obvious reasons. When medical transport or the bus isn’t taking her where she needs to go, I drive. She is trying to get on disability. Her 3rd appeal hearing isn’t till February. She can only work part time at Panera due to all of these factors, so she can’t contribute much financially at the moment as well as physically. 

We have 5 pets because we’re really good with animals and have a soft spot for them and people keep giving us the pets they can’t care for anymore. They are very demanding and make a lot of mess.

My family is made up of a lot of crazy people who don’t understand boundaries, are extremely overprotective, controlling, and have no tact whatsoever. They love me very much. They love me to the point where they basically have me under surveillance so they can insert themselves into any situation they see as a problem sometimes even before I’m aware there is a problem. I don’t ask for help. Dad finds out through third parties that I am not aware of and explodes on the scene demanding I do whatever he tells me to do or I’m going to die!! Not because he’s going to kill me, but because whatever problem he was informed about is always apparently a life or death situation to him unless he fixes it himself. And he would never forgive himself if he didn’t act immediately and save me from dying!!! I wish I was exaggerating, but this really is an accurate description of the level of crazy that I’m dealing with. And this really is my Dad’s thought process when he does this. I know this because he vents to the rest of the family without realizing it and gets them all riled up thinking I’m in imminent danger and I’m irrationally ungrateful about being rescued. And they never question the validity of this. His crazy is my fault because I’m irresponsible and I demand too much help from him. Remember I don’t ask for help. He has informants that go over my head so he’s decided I need help and I’m just too embarrassed to ask. None of this is rational. There is no way to reassure him or reason with him on this issue. He’s 80. He’s not changing now. All you can do is pick your battles and say “Thank you” a lot and try to do what he wants within some level of reason so he goes home. 

I’ve tried focusing on one habit at a time, but then I’m not focusing on other things that are just as important. Those fall behind and something gets disconnected for example. Now I’m going to die because Dad knows someone at the gas company who just happened to notice who I am and he thought he’d let Dad know because that’s something he’d want to know. And Dad’s storming into the house because I’m going to die with no working furnace in the middle of summer! This actually happened less than 10 years ago. 

I’m a hard working person. I just need someone who gets it to challenge me to move when my brain says it’s done moving for the day. Someone who’s not a raging lunatic and who can work at a similar pace to mine. 

I don’t know. Maybe pick a room or a handful of tasks that might take a similar amount of time and/or effort to accomplish. Give each other a set interval of time to do that on a given day. An hour. 2 hours. Share before and after pictures for proof you did it. I don’t know what you’d get or not get for succeeding or not, but I’m game for suggestions. Agree to do this 3 times a week. See where we are after a full week. Maybe it’s a stupid idea. I don’t know I’m just throwing stuff out there. I don’t have many friends. What friends I do have are very busy and I haven’t had contact with them for a while. My friends at work don’t interact outside of work. My best friend is my roommate. With her psychological issues and neurological issues, often her symptoms are very similar to being high functioning on the autism scale. But she didn’t test positive for being on the spectrum, according to her psychiatrist this is all trauma based anxiety. So to get her help with house stuff, I have to slow down and guide her through things one step at a time until she gets what she’s doing and how you want it done. She doesn’t just know to do things, you have to ask and be extremely specific with instructions. She’s so focused on what she feels she needs to do that she gets tunnel vision. She doesn’t notice anything else unless you tell her to notice it. I’m fine with all that, but there are a lot of things that I need to be able to move faster. I’m thinking you guys can move faster. We can challenge each other and I don’t have to literally hold your hand except in a distant supportive way. 

I’ve already broken through some of my auto pilot. I moved down to the living room. I’m sleeping on a very comfy couch. I did this to jolt myself out of auto pilot. It’s working. A lot of our habits have changed, but I still need to book it with taking care of big chunks of a complete household overhaul that Mr Crazy Pants has decided to delegate and that I genuinely agreed to. He’s just a raging lunatic and he’s demanded this needs to be done in 2 weeks so he feels I’m free to do other things and work on a better routine in a house that isn’t going to kill me. 

I’m sorry for the rant. My situation is very unique so it takes some explaining. I’ve tried so many different methods and followed so much of the same advice over and over. I’ve had ideas I’ve tried that my psychiatrist has requested pictures of so he can share those methods with others. While those ideas have been innovative and have apparently been successful for other people, nothing seems to stick for me. Maybe because I’m alone. I’m very isolated. Everyone actually willing to help is severely limited, feels compelled to be a dick about it, or they’re on Dad’s payroll. Those are my options."
ADHD,feafkk6,t3_eo7qrc,1578948111.0,"Yes my roommate and I are doing that first thing already. Rewards don’t work for me because I have no impulse control for that stuff. My brain very much lives by the rule out of sight out of mind so if I can’t see the important thing I need to remember to do I won’t remember to do it. But yes that is the goal for me to have everything have it’s own place. Changing one habit at a time is not an option at this point. It would be preferable, but I do not have that luxury. My family has decided to help me get myself together. By “help”, they think that means they are the adult in the room making them in charge of monitoring my progress. Because clearly I don’t know how to make decisions and I don’t know what kind of help I really need. Baby steps aren’t noticeable enough to be considered visible progress. For them a week is a long time. I should be done by then. Not meeting these expectations of clearly visible significant progress in a very short period of time results in them starting a fight where I am forced to defend myself with explanations they consider to be cheap excuses. Once the house is what they consider to be squared away, then I’ll be allowed to go at my pace with a routine sort of. Also by “help” they mean only actively helping when it’s convenient for them so I am expected to do most of this myself."
aww,fe9cb9w,t1_fe8w823,1578936310.0,"Lol shield toad. I love that! 

I think tortoise people just have a pet peeve to make sure that people differentiate. I think when most people think of a turtle they think of the kind that spends most of their time in water. Tortoises can’t swim. At most you’ll see them soaking in a watering hole shallow enough to rest their bottom shell on the ground but keep their head above water. They’re also strictly herbivores unlike the others. Terrapins are turtles that spend equal time on land and in water. And turtles that are turtles spend most if not all their time in water. They only come up to breathe, bask on a log, or lay eggs. Yes. They’re all technically turtles, but those 3 sub types are very different from each other."

aww,fe6pgnh,t3_enylr8,1578899351.0,"That is a tortoise. All tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. Tortoises are specifically terrestrial meaning you’re going to find them in more arid environments. They don’t swim. They wallow and dig and climb. That’s why their legs are more like trunks and their feet aren’t webbed."
ADHD,fe6otw8,t3_enybk3,1578898588.0,"I’m on a mood stabilizer for severe depression and anxiety with suicidal tendencies. Now I cry more often and it’s hard to stop, but I consider that progress. When I was younger, my mom didn’t like when I showed extreme emotions. Even positive ones. So I stopped showing those emotions. I tend not to get too excited about things. I don’t lash out when I’m angry. I just get very quiet and I don’t look at anyone. Mom started calling me “Ice Princess” and “Hard Hearted Hanna”. She’d tell people, “when I’m on my death bed, I want Carolyn to pull the cord because she won’t cry about it.” So being able to cry is progress to me.

I’m actually more famous now for having the opposite emotional response. When I get so stressed I hit a breaking point, I start laughing and I can’t stop. I’ll go for at least an hour or two of maniacal laughter where everything is hilarious. The girls at work get popcorn. They equate it to an episode of Batman. Everyone calls it Joker Mode. I have a distinct laugh. When I really get going even just non stress laughing, I end up sounding just like Mark Hamill as The Joker. It doesn’t help when my roommate chimes in with a quiet “I’m Batman” in the middle of it either. 

Right now I’m going through a very serious phase which isn’t good. I’m taking everything too seriously. I haven’t really unleashed my Joker in a while so I’m sure that will erupt at some point at the worst possible moment."
ADHD,fe6n27o,t1_fe6cxmp,1578896585.0,"Yeah. I seem to have very bad luck in that area. I can’t even have parties. No one shows up. I find if I plan everything and do the invites, no one shows up. They don’t even call to let me know. They just don’t show up. It’s uncanny how this happens. Everyone’s daughter spontaneously goes into labor, or they get sick and go to the hospital that day, or a house crisis that needs immediate attention like the main breaks. All legitimate emergencies actually happening at the same time all to people I invited to a party a month ago. Legitimately. I’m saying they’re not lying to get out of a stupid party. All these random crises happening. At the same time. All completely randomly on that particular day.

But if someone else does all the invites and I still host the party, none of that happens and the party goes as planned. It’s the weirdest thing how this happens. No one believes me either. My dad asked me to stop trying to have parties in college because no one ever showed up and I was just wasting money at that point. Now if I host something now that I’ve moved back to my hometown, I have to convince some very confused friend or family member to invite everyone for me to make sure people show up. And they always think I’m just being weird and paranoid. Except my roommate. She’s seen this phenomenon happen first hand. 

One of 2 curses I seem to have. The other being a shopping curse. No one has heard of the thing I’m looking for when I need it. Even something as common as a particular size of a generic brand of Tupperware. “Tupperware? I’ve never heard of that. I don’t think we carry anything like that...” The day after I need it. The same exact sales person: “Yeah. We’ve always had that. Duh! Everyone knows what Tupperware is!” Face palm!! 

Does anyone else find they have epic bad timing like that? Scheduling things to find people randomly needing to spontaneously bail for a legitimate reason? Needing help at the exact time no one is even remotely available to assist except maybe that one person who just had back surgery. They don’t know how much help they’ll be but they’ll sure try. Having a bad day on the one day that’s the worst thing to happen? Like, everyone is allowed to have a bad day or a grumpy day, but you just happened to have your one grumpy day and snapped at the one person at work who’s family member just died and now everyone thinks you’re an ass? Or having a particularly bad brain day on the one day corporate decides to show up and they just happen to be having their one grumpy day?"
ADHD,fe6amn3,t3_enpyrc,1578885571.0,"I have 2 alarms I set on my phone. Sometimes a 3rd. I also 3 pets that I sleep with. Normally there’s a 4th, but he’s in my roommate’s room right now during our whole cleaning process. 

Taz, my male cat, has hyperthyroidism. Without his medication, he’s in a state of raging hangry. Have you ever been so hungry you forget what food is? That’s Taz. We call it Shaggy Syndrome. He follows me around screaming till I drop wet food in his bowl. He also wakes me as soon as he senses me stir. Every time I get up to pee is an opportunity for him to get a can of food. He has several tactics to get me up. His favorite is to find a plastic grocery bag and paw at it till I snap awake. With the lights off and barely conscious, that plastic bag sounds like he’s peeing where he’s not supposed to and will pull me out of a dead sleep. “AAH!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING???” With his mock innocent “I’m up to no good” trill.

Sammy, my female cat, has a very impressive purr box. She tolerates Taz enough that if his attempts haven’t worked, she’ll tap herself in. She will sit on my chest, purr very loud, and touch my nose.

Taji, my cockatiel who is hanging out with my roommate, wakes up with the sun and immediately begins singing and having a full blown conversation with the sun loud enough so that the sun can hear him through the window.

Shelly, my tortoise, stares at me from his dog bed till I prepare his morning salad for him. I can feel him staring at me.

If my roommate’s dog, Sissy, manages to wake her up before 6:45 she may run in, eat Taz’s food while he’s not looking, and then launch herself on top of me to attempt a French kiss before I wake up enough to turn my head in time. 

So that’s 8 alarms. Sometimes going off every 2 hours throughout the night. Taz is the only one willing to negotiate. He may get huffy about it, but he’ll go lay back down for 10 minutes if I ask him to. And on weekends I just have to tell him mommy doesn’t work today and he’ll curl up with me and give me an extra half hour or so. Really he just wants his pill, his wet food, everyone else fed and watered, mommy to brush her teeth and go to the bathroom... and then I’m free to go back to bed for as long as I want."

You’ll kill a beast and there will be an immediate echo. And I’m a classically trained vocalist so he gets all excited when I break into musical theater or opera. I made up a simple 3 note “I love you” song for him and he’ll sing it when I’m leaving for work in the morning. Monty Python “Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life” is his mommy is showering song.
aww,fe2l686,t1_fe29yow,1578839794.0,"Aw! Yes even cockatiels can be just as rewarding! That’s why I said they’re like toddlers. They really are like taking care of a human toddler. You have to commit. They’re smart, destructive, messy, adorable, and trying. They eat a lot of the same things we do. They’re extremely social and they like to yell for fun a lot so they’re loud. I have a very cheeky cockatiel. He’s turning 13 this year!

We also have a tortoise. They really are like old Hungarian men. I say specifically Hungarian because their stubbornness is on a whole other level. Tortoises are stubborn, determined, and have epic resting bitch face. They’re faster than you think and they can climb. They’re also strong. Mine climbed a 3 foot woodpile. I followed him down the sidewalk 3 houses down to the empty houses yard where he decided to stop for lunch. Then he tried to climb their padlocked back fence. Why? There’s always something better on the other side. Probably the bestest place for a nap. I had to pick him up and cart him back home. “No we’re not illegally breaking into the yard.” 

We also have 2 cats and a dog. We used to have a hamster too, but she passed a few months ago. The carnivores like to baby the other two. Sammy (our female cat) has been charmed by the cockatiel. She wanted to hunt him at first and then he serenaded her so now she sits next to his cage to be groomed and sung to while she watches the squirrels out the window. The tortoise gets the star treatment though. They bring him blankets and pillows. This is all completely unprompted by us. We have not trained them to do this. And the hamster would get in her ball and chase the cats. She really enjoyed terrorizing them. Even outside the ball my male cat would try to share food with her. He really likes taking care of the other pets. He follows me around reminding me to do things like a nagging spouse. My family is just now figuring out I’m not exaggerating when I say I have 5 children. I win in the grandchildren numbers game and I did not have to give birth."

“You’re smart. Why can’t you do that yourself?”
“You’re smarter than this Carolyn!”
“Stop making excuses!”

Yeah I’ve heard it all. Mostly from friends and family. That’s why I try my best not to ask for help because I always get a barrage of that which makes me feel bad for inconveniencing people. And then they all get mad that I didn’t ask for help when I needed it because that’s even more of an inconvenience that they’re apparently obligated to solve for me since I didn’t bother to ask for help when the problem was more manageable and less expensive. If I call them out on this paradox, then I need to be more sensitive to the important schedules of others when I ask and I need to give a specific recent example that they also remember in that level of detail that they can also agree happened the exact way I remember it happened with no alternative interpretations. There is no winning for me in this game btw.

I have started writing a cheeky memoir of sorts. Rules For The Carolyn: A list of rules Carolyn must follow when attempting to interact with others. That I will be sharing with my therapist. And then sharing with my stepmom the next time she comes with me to therapy."

ADHD,fdovrwe,t3_elommu,1578613995.0,"ADD And Loving It. I found it to be a unique approach. An entertainer who does primarily sketch comedy and improv agreed to be officially tested for ADHD on the program, so it shows him and his wife going through and filling out the official questions on camera. So they’re laughing at how spot on the questions are and they’ll give anecdotes of things he’s done in the past or on a regular basis as examples. And in between these snippets are interviews with experts. A lot of the experts in the program are the authors of some of the books people have listed here like “You Mean I’m Not Lazy, Crazy, Or Stupid?” “ADD Stole My Car Keys.” And a lot of these authors also have ADD. It’s really well done. 

I don’t think you can access it from Amazon Prime anymore, though it is still listed. The best place to get it whether you want the DVD or just want to stream it, is to go to the official ADD And Loving It website. You’ll also find the books by the authors featured in the program there as well as other merchandise there as well.

Oh and that’s just the tip of the iceberg sweetie. The rabbit hole that is my childhood doesn’t fit in a handful of posts. I will say this though. There are a lot of people who have had it much worse than me, but I still wouldn’t wish my past on anyone. It’s a bad trip that I can say is actually very unique.

ADHD,fdmyklq,t3_em5aok,1578571455.0,"Sounds like my supervisors! I’m sorry you were initially embarrassed about it! I was taught not to mention that stuff about my condition in the work place either, but I’m glad I didn’t listen. I stopped being shy about that stuff after my HR director demanded I do the research on ADD. I figured it’s a part of me. It’s not an excuse, but it’s a reason why I sometimes do things that make little sense to normal people. Why bother hiding all that when it’s probably more advantageous to educate people on how it affects me, ask them for a bit of patience and see if they can offer any genuinely helpful feedback on how we can get around this quirk that I may not always have 100% control over. If they just sit there and bitch about how annoying I am, doesn’t that make them part of the problem and aren’t they wasting my time as much as I seem to be wasting theirs? They couldn’t argue with that.

And now I’m finding more and more that the whole office is gravitating toward that attitude. And because of that my coworkers and bosses were the ones who helped me improve my communication skills and helped me get over my fear of authority figures. Which in turn has helped me find my voice with my family so we can start to repair those relationships. Hiding doesn’t help."
ADHD,fdjkk83,t3_elommu,1578475232.0,"I have not read any books. I went straight to medical articles and forums. But I did watch a great video that got me started. ADD And Loving It. 

I was having trouble getting to work on time and my HR director was getting angry because I wasn’t taking my ADD very seriously. I mean I was raised with very old fashioned parents who only seemed to know the myths. These were people who had my IQ tested along side my ADD back in the early 80s when I was about 4-5 because they heard a rumor ADD means you’re stupid. Low and behold I tested with an IQ of 128 so I shouldn’t have any problems unless I’m just being lazy. So no. I wasn’t taking it seriously. 

Turned out my HR directors son has it so he knows more about it than the average person. He suggested I take the time to research while they work on why I was having trouble with my prescription coverage. No authority figure had ever done any of that before. Never actually tried to help me get the resources I need and made helpful suggestions rather than just yelling and making fun of my incompetence.

Incidentally that night this video was showing on PBS. I missed the first 10 minutes but it made me stop and “I should watch this just to see what it says.” 

I was shocked to say the least. I knew it was an issue with focusing, but it’s so much more than that. I was surprised by how extensively the various symptoms stretch across every aspect of a person’s life. Every area where I struggle the most can be attributed to a symptom. I was also shocked that it’s genetic. I was always told I got it from a traumatic childbirth. That I was predicted to have serious developmental disabilities or not survive at all so I was lucky I made it out with just a mild case of ADD.

Come to find out it’s really genetic and my case is actually severe. The next thing I noticed was how much the symptoms reminded me of my dad. I could see a line of behavior: traumatic childhood experience getting in trouble because of a symptom run amok; scared daughter will have the same experience; must save daughter now before that happens; become obsessed with setting up perfect financial fail safe; forget to tell anyone else about awesome protection plan but have a distinct memory of telling the people he forgot to tell; spontaneously whips out bank contract on hood of car in church parking lot and orders daughter to sign; gets irate when presented with questions because questions means she doesn’t trust you’re just trying to help prevent disaster and that’s a personal insult!!! Okay let’s get ice cream. Daddy loves you!

Like you can’t access anything entertaining on your phone till you get rid of this annoying pop up that refuses to be ignored.
ADHD,fdcq4kt,t1_fdckrdl,1578281233.0,"Yes it is gaslighting. To be honest though I don’t think they are being intentionally abusive. I think they’re oblivious to how they sound and oblivious to how they contradict themselves. Even in the same sentence. I think if I were to record them and play it back they’d still have no clue. My therapist wanted to smack my stepmom and tell her to go home. She thinks she’s so oblivious that she can’t possibly contribute anything to the conversation. I told my therapist that was the point. If she’s that clueless, then they all are. It’s a really weird phenomenon. They show all the signs of a toxic family, but they have no idea that’s what they sound like. And if finally ever wrap their heads around that concept, I can almost bet money they’d be horrified.

Also there’s a generational thing here. My grandma and I would discuss this in length. The difference in child rearing techniques back when she had her first daughter (my mom) to how her great grandchildren are raised now. My grandma’s doctor advised her not to show affection to her children because that would make them weak in adulthood, so that’s what she did. And now that technique is considered abusive. Grandma said she wasn’t sure about the whole “hugging just because” thing when she first heard about it with her grandchildren. It took some getting used to for her, but she was glad that affection was a growing trend. She never would have thought that would have a negative impact on her children because that’s what doctors recommended at that time. 

My mom was 37 when she had me and my dad was 40. A lot of child rearing techniques that were standard for their generation would now have an official psychological name and be classified as abuse nowadays. That’s why there are so many people in my generation with attachment issues. The cycle either continues or goes in the extreme opposite direction for the next generation. Either way each generation will traumatize their kids in their own special way. I found my talks with grandma quite enlightening. A lot of stuff made sense after grandma and I started trying to figure out what went wrong. And she was special because she and I could talk about this stuff and she knew I wasn’t trying to blame anyone. She knew I was just trying to understand, so she didn’t take anything personally. It’s actually quite interesting to see how things evolve between generations. 

And yeah, I don’t have many friends. No one has time or patience. People tend to keep me at arms length. I’m always too much in all the wrong places and not enough in all the wrong places. I just sort of try to be useful."
ADHD,fdcj2a9,t1_fdcd30j,1578276132.0,"That’s okay. That was an honest answer. People have said I have the patience of a saint. (Not my words and I don’t know if I believe that.) And I do come from a family of high resilience. We’re the kind of people who tell our doctor in ICU, “you have 3 days to get me out of here or so help me I will check myself out whether you like it or not.” “We’d really like to keep you in for observation for a good week.” “You have 3 days starting now.” And I’ve seen my dad sacrifice everything for his family. Everything he’s gone through. I couldn’t do that to him. He’s fought for me. I’ll keep fighting for him. 

I just don’t like being a burden. I don’t like the implication of it. It makes my brain go to dark places like, “would it be easier on their finances if I just wasn’t here? It seems it would be less inconvenient for them.” 

And I don’t like when people say I should prove myself to him. In my experience people see what they want. They’ll spin anything to fit whatever narrative they believe. They have to be willing to see something different for any proof to work, but that’s usually the advice I get the most and it really doesn’t make sense. In fact more often than not the advice I get from my family isn’t really advice at all. It’s just them trying to convince themselves they did nothing wrong and their bad reaction is really my own fault instead of admitting that I have a point.

I guess the advice I’m looking for more specifically is how other people cope with confrontation with a loved one who means well but doesn’t understand. And they’re hitting below the belt, but they don’t realize they’re hitting below the belt. I have a tendency to freeze up. Words are hard. I can’t articulate my point of view in coherent sentences. A lot of times I fold in on myself and internalize everything. I’m alone a lot, so I tend to over analyze after the fact. I’ve pretty much been trained not to lash out like most people do. I’ve been trained to see things from everyone else’s point of view before mine. These are things that have been drilled into me since I was a kid. Everyone else’s reactions are perfectly normal and valid. But that rule doesn’t apply to me in return. I just need to understand that everyone else is fine and I deserve whatever I get and it’s my job to adjust myself to fit the needs of others. Forcing them to hear my voice and putting my foot down when I object to something is still very new to me. My family can be very intimidating and standing up to them is in some ways terrifying. It’s like walking up to a mountain and telling it not to be so hard headed only to trigger an avalanche. Something very minor could potentially start the apocalypse. So I guess it’s more... how do you keep your cool under these circumstances?"
ADHD,fdcbued,t1_fdc6pnp,1578271183.0,"I agree. This is definitely my family though. I can’t deny that and I can’t just avoid them because they don’t know how to talk to me and have no tact. We’ve been through too much as a family and they really do mean well despite not knowing how to show it. 

My sister’s problem is she has been vastly misinformed about me. My mom was on a lot of steroids because of a heart transplant. Those types of steroids in such high doses for such long periods of time have psychological side effects similar to symptoms found in bipolar and/or schizophrenia even. When you’re that sick all the time, in that much pain all the time, with those kind of side effects thrown into the mix... You’re just angry and you’re not thinking straight and a little kid makes a great punching bag to project all the things you hate about yourself onto. My siblings are over 10 years older than me. Mom had a habit of venting about me over the phone to her. So she grew up under the impression that I’m selfish, self centered, irrational, irresponsible, and ungrateful among other things. 

My dad also tends to be very intense and tends to panic when things aren’t just right. He swoops in unannounced like a banshee pointing at things he doesn’t like in my house. He works himself into one hell of a tizzy till he convinces himself I’m going to die if he doesn’t take action now. Of course this is very upsetting. It’s hard to defend yourself without sounding like a 12 year old when you’re really 40. I usually end up arguing and crying. I am not normally a cryer. 

My defensive behavior and stuttering wailing is very upsetting to him. He usually vents to anyone who will listen in the family. He doesn’t even realize he’s doing it. Of course, I’m not there so they only get his perspective which seems to corroborate with moms perspective in the past. So they have this inaccurate picture painted for them of what kind of person I am.

It means they really do love me. They really are concerned for my wellbeing. They are doing what they feel is right. And they have no idea who I am as a person, but they are convinced that they do know. You don’t avoid that fight. You face it and hope they figure out what dumbasses they are so you can be better as a family. Doesn’t make it any less frustrating though."

He may get angry and lash out or act up. Getting him to breathe and talk about it without being judgmental is really hard but will help him in the long run. It shows him he can trust you to have his back no matter how frustrating things get. Some days he’ll have it more together than others. It’s neurological. Not something that can be fixed or cured. It’s a daily struggle. Teach him it’s not an excuse, it’s a reason. It’s not his fault, but there’s no reason he can’t find a way around it. And not all the symptoms are inherently bad.

Not perfect. Not even sub par. But back to where we left off at least. Took care of a big chunk. Bought a printer/scanner/copier. It’s wireless. It can help us digitize a financial budget. We’ve narrowed it down to 3 programs that we like. I’m sick of not having a clear view of what I’m working with financially. It also prints photos. We’ve been teaching ourselves how to use photoshop. We’re very creative. I see it as a business opportunity for extra money. We’ve done so much and worked so hard. People said we should be proud of ourselves. 

Then Dad came in. He doesn’t see any progress therefore we haven’t done a thing. We had an issue with the bank on 2 previous electric bill payments. He found our notice with our notes of a minimum payment to take the disconnect off the table till we can figure out what happened and resolve the issue. He just thinks we didn’t pay and I’m wasting money. He helps so some of that is his money he thinks I’m wasting. He brought up his new favorite talking point. How much he spends on me per year voluntarily and the financial burden it is for him. 

I accidentally vented to my sister. Her favorite talking point is that Dad is 80. He should be retired but he’s not because of me. I should be less dependent on him. Less demanding. (I don’t ask for help. He does this voluntarily. Aggressively voluntarily. Like a helicopter parent.) I need to understand the inconvenience they’ve had to face by treating me like an equal, by taking time out of their busy schedule to come over and delegate how to clean my house, inform me of their superior knowledge of ADHD that apparently I haven’t bothered to research properly, and burden of trying to see things from my point of view. 

Here’s the kicker. They don’t understand why I’m depressed. They don’t understand where I got the idea that they think I’m a burden. They love me. They would never say or imply anything like that. I shouldn’t be so negative. That’s a habit I need to change. I need to be less defensive and more open to change.

So yeah. I’m feeling that way too. I probably shouldn’t be alone with my thoughts right now. Yes. I’m haven’t missed a day of medication. But I think my emotions correctly express the situation so there’s that. Let’s be miserable together! Shall we?"
ADHD,fd7rm9d,t3_ek64ik,1578209011.0,"Congratulate the small victories. It’s easy to worry about your kids and get caught up in a spiral of worried frustration. It’s difficult but teaching your kid to laugh at his mistakes, dust himself off and problem solve through the consequences and/or try again is very important. He’s going to make a lot of mistakes and it’s going to make it harder and harder to get back up. Laughter lightens the load and makes it easier to get back up again. 

If he asks for help, don’t make a fuss and claim you don’t have time and leave it at that. That’ll just teach him not to bother asking. Instead, try negotiating a better time or a better idea and then stick to that plan. It shows him to respect the obligations of others, but that his needs are also important. 

Kids are surprisingly in tune to the grown ups around them. How you react to him and interact with him and others will eventually be reflected in how he handles similar situations as an adult. Is he going to respect his own time and the precious time of others? Is he going to ask for help when he needs it? Is he going to brush off set backs and try again? Is he going to feel confident enough to problem solve for himself when he realistically can? Will he be able to resolve situations through negotiation and compromise in a civil manner? Will he be able to express how he feels or how his symptoms affect him to you or another adult so that you can help him find creative and effective ways around those issues? These are all important skills that really make a difference in adulthood. Sadly there are a lot of adults ages 30 on up who don’t know how to do any of that."

You still have to fill it out but they explain what each box is for and in extreme cases may take dictation. My roommate specifically needed my help with medical aid forms. She has severe trauma based anxiety and many physical health issues. I’m telling you all this to assure you that you’re not alone. Now without a sympathetic family member or friend I’m not sure about specifics. Every state/county has different policies and programs.

Our public libraries are also very helpful and on less busy days will also answer any questions. I know this because my cousins husband is the head of one of the departments at the main branch.

A magazine on the coffee table is a mess they feel compelled to apologize over. And the fact I find that strange and a little disturbing is cause for alarm and obviously my medication isn’t working well enough. Dishes left in the sink is cause for a meltdown. Someone clearly needs to accompany me to my psychiatrist and tell him to up the dosage because the dishes aren’t getting done and I’m going to die!!! I wish I were exaggerating this.
ADHD,fcz97ng,t1_fcyx64g,1578096217.0,"Me too. Dad called earlier and apologized for getting frustrated. I asked my sister how New Years went and ended up on a tangent about how I tend not to celebrate small victories because it usually means something bad is going to happen.  Case in point. Of course she informed me I need to grow up and then passed all that information on to Dad because apparently he should know all of our private conversations. But I need to grow up and stop being so dependent on him. 

It’s always after these conversations I realize they really have no idea what we’re fighting. Dad seems to think he’s going to hire people to clean my house and I’ll be able to magically have a perfect routine that I’ll be able to keep indefinitely or else. My sister seems to think that I just make excuses, get defensive and negative for no reason, and demand too much from Dad. They don’t see their part in any of this. 

It’s like being in a war room strategizing an attack and their are 2 generals from a different country who think no else in the room can make a decision without their help. In reality, they have no idea who their real opponent is and they’ve vastly underestimated the situation so really they’re contributing very little to the conversation.

Dad was like, “just fight a little longer. We can finish this in a couple weeks!” I just said, “No we can’t. There is no end. There is no cure. No quick fix. No final battle and we’re done. Breaking bad habits and developing new routines takes time. This is merely a learning experience. It’s an ongoing process. Realistically speaking the fight never ends. It just evolves over time. You have to be diligent and consistent and there’s a lot of room for error. I really need you to understand that Dad.”"
