love,ff50uma,t1_ff4ssy6,1579577208.0,"Sorry I couldn't offer you a better solution . Being much older than you I can tell you from experience that alot of times you will find love when you least expect it. Don't be on a mission, just live life...you never know who you will meet...when or where you will meet them. Just live with a open heart. You are still young. You are still evolving as a person. Many people will come and go in your life. Each will leave an imprint in your heart.Some experiences may be difficult and some will be amazing but all the trials, errors and triumphs will shape you as a person. Things happen for a reason and there is a purpose for your existence. Just be patient, live your days being the best person that you can. That's all I can say based on my life experiences. I wish you the best and hope you find your happiness."

relationship_advice,feyl6u9,t3_eqxa3v,1579447063.0,"My opinion is ""yes"". You cannot force feelings to be there if they are not. The only reason to ever stay in a relationship is because you both love each other and cannot imagine living life without each other. There should be no doubts. I understand you don't want to hurt her but the sooner you end things the better. The longer you wait the more emotions will be invested ."
tippytaps,feyj5mh,t3_eqx16h,1579446154.0,"Oh my goodness. Cuteness overload. If everyone in the world had a puppers like this to come home to "" depression"" would not exist.

aww,feyh2qr,t3_eqx2x2,1579445459.0,Adorable. Enjoy your new furbaby and thank you for giving him a forever home. May you have many years of happiness and unconditional love together.
love,feyg1kr,t3_epqt8e,1579445022.0,I would recommend getting a pet if you are able. You may not have found the human version of the love of your life yet but I guarantee you that if you got a pet you would have unconditional love and companionship. It may fill the void in your life and most likely help with the depression and sadness you have. Not to mention you would be providing a home for an animal that is currently without a home or someone who cares about them.
relationship_advice,fes7s2q,t3_eqhdf6,1579362259.0,"You started out with "" I'm happily married"" . Apparently not by the rest of your story."
relationship_advice,feroup2,t3_eqgpqi,1579356633.0,My parents have very different sleep cycles. My Dad goes to bed very early and gets up very early and my Mom goes to bed very late and gets up very late. It actually works out perfect . They each have their alone time . My Dad's in the morning and my Mom's at night.  Works out great as it allows each of them their alone time which is very important to have in a relationship especially if you live together. Embrace it .
aww,fenorrt,t1_fenhxtx,1579288727.0, I agree. Very heartwarming. Restores some of my faith in human kind

dating_advice,fd57d68,t1_fd50t29,1578174932.0,According to one guy he said a guy interested in only FWB would tell a women anything she wanted to hear just to have sex soI figured what would be the point. I just wondered would a guy do all this texting just for that.
dating_advice,fd567nw,t1_fd54b7t,1578174600.0,That's all I was wondering. Like I said I had not been dating in awhile so I don't know how things work these days. I have read and heard so many negative experiences . I just did not want to let my feelings to get to involved for nothing.

Advice,fd4x0h2,t1_fd4vvji,1578171879.0,Thanks for your input.
Advice,fd4thbt,t1_fd4sisg,1578170929.0,That's why I am asking if this sounds like he would only be interested in FWB type of thing. I haven't been actively dating for a bit so I don't know how things are in the dating workd these days.
Advice,fd4sr6y,t1_fd4sckc,1578170786.0,Thanks for your input. I hadn't dated in awhile so I am not sure how things are these days.

relationship_advice,fcjy97v,t3_ehlio1,1577710269.0,"No they are not. Some may not be 50-50, but should be pretty close. You sound like you are doing everything yourself. Mentally, physically and financially. You do not need or deserve this bum. Cut him loose and your life will improve dramatically. You will meet a guy who is willing to be a true partner to you in life. Many wishes for a much better life in 2020 for you."
relationship_advice,fci920r,t1_fci8o30,1577659230.0,I never said I thought that.
relationship_advice,fci7dkc,t1_fchrmor,1577658617.0,"Not ALL women get expensive hairdos and  expensive manicures. Personally, I do my own nails as I am not about all that fake crap. Fake hair, nails , eyelashes, etc. I guess if some women need it to feel attractive that is their business. I think you are just meeting the wrong type of women but please don't lump us all in the same category."
relationship_advice,fci5v7v,t1_fci22ep,1577658124.0,I agree.
relationship_advice,fchrx29,t3_ehb1du,1577653491.0,I don't care about a guys money. All I care about in that aspect is that he can support himself and does not ask me for money. I have my own income and am able to support myself. The most important quality to me is honesty.
datingoverforty,fc9569s,t3_ed46ka,1577547213.0,I am not on facebook and I am a trustworthy person. I do not feel the need to post my life online. The people that are important in my life are notified IRL about anything newsworthy. Not everyone likes to live in the limelight.
