relationship_advice,femxfi7,t3_epzuim,1579272118.0,"I've had a situation where a friend told me he liked me romantically whom I really love and cherish, just not in that way. I remained friends without problems to this day and would like for this to remain like that. I truly appreciate this persons presence in my life and I'm happy for this person when I know they've found a good partner and a happy relationship. That being said, I don't know the dynamics of your situation, but you feel alright remaining friends, do it. If you think that will be a problem, ask your friend to stay away, explaining it will only do you more harm than good."

unpopularopinion,fdeh92i,t1_fde6flq,1578338981.0,"This! Everytime someone is trying to go against the trend, they just feel the need to insult the other type. I thought exactly the same as you! OP said a tan made you look old and trashy. To a insecure naturally tan person, growing up in a predominant pale area this could make them insecure!"
unpopularopinion,fdegth3,t3_ektsdb,1578338713.0,"So, I'm a naturally tanned girl. I like that. I just don't understand why people feel the need to shove their insecurities down someone else's throat. I get what this subreddit is about, but this seems to be common practice. I don't care what your skin tone is so please, could you just do the same so we could get on to more productive things?"

wholesomememes,fcxqgc9,t1_fcxpmx4,1578069012.0,"Well, it's a blanket that ways more than normal. It has weights distribuited through out the blanket and should feel like your whole body is being hugged. I think a lot of people use it to cope with anxiety and sleeping problems. I don't have one myself but I've been reading some product reviews and they seem really nice."
