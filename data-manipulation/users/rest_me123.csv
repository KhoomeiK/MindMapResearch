The Cavendish experiment just measures gravity between masses and the constant on earth. How does it proof the globe? The origin of gravity is still not known.

The coriolis Force is a good argument, youâ€™d need to trust the cloud footage from space though. 

Some ships donâ€™t disappear behind the horizon when they should, as several videos show. 

The space footage of earth can be artificially made these days. I must say the no gravity footage on the ISS is pretty convincing though.

You donâ€™t know if you can go around earth in every direction without doing it yourself. 

Eclipses are indeed a problem in flat earth theory."
