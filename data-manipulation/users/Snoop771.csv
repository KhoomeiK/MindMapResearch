AskReddit,febq4dh,t1_febmqcx,1578961483.0,"Incorrect. A photograph shows a relation between space and light, hue, saturation etc. It is simply data presented in a way as to appear as an image. A photograph is a graph. A TV presents a dynamic graph. It doesn't really matter, I'm sure your not interested in the truth, only things which confirm your world view. That's fine but it will work out very badly because facts will remain the facts whether you deny them or not. Anthropogenic climate change is a very obvious example. You can't change reality by denying it."
AskReddit,febnx30,t1_febm1fo,1578960865.0,No. You said if someone did not want to have sex with a trans person they would be transphobic. Same logic applies to homophobia. That is extremely irrational although not surprising. Reddit is censoring me because the extremists on Reddit don't like facts which contradict their view of the world. I can't have an honest debate on Reddit so I'll stick to doing it in the real world where it actually matters.
AskReddit,feblzoq,t1_febihgy,1578960196.0,Look up what a phobia is.
AskReddit,febjmnq,t1_febihgy,1578959509.0,So if I dislike having sex with someone with a penis I am homophobic?
AskReddit,febh46e,t1_febf6fj,1578958715.0,"Incorrect, a phobia is an anxiety disorder that is diagnosed and treated by psychologists. It is an irrational fear. Having a sexual preference that does not include trans people is not an irrational fear."
AskReddit,febeqsg,t1_febco0q,1578958110.0,Yes it is. And moronic people are diagnosing bigots with phobias all the time with no qualification to do so. Now if only people can recognise that phobias are mental health conditions that should only be diagnosed by qualified psychologists instead of by some pleb on social media in order to label some bigot.
AskReddit,febcmgv,t1_feb3adx,1578957508.0,"Any word with -sexual as the suffix refers to sexuality, not gender. An exception is the word ""paedophile"" which refers to a sexual preference for children even though it literally means ""loves children""."
AskReddit,febbm0x,t1_feaz58g,1578957185.0,How about letting qualified psychologists decide what is and isn't a phobia?
AskReddit,febay9f,t3_eo83cx,1578957061.0,"Yes. Although I feel like this may be baiting for some attack. The sex partner has a right to know what to expect. Transgender is not the norm so they will be expecting the gender you represent yourself as. Most people are attracted to one gender or the other so they will want to know what gender you are (including trans). It's a complicated issue of course and there are exceptions, but honesty is best if they want to avoid confusion and problems."
AustralianPolitics,feb9hpg,t1_fear33i,1578956589.0,"Of course they are, most of the media are scum. I wonder how much of the public mental health problems are due to the media. I think it would surprise most people."

AustralianPolitics,feay0mq,t1_fe9culm,1578953389.0,It defies logic to say that the country emitting less pollution per person needs to improve more than the country polluting more. Obviously you are wrong but you lack the humility to admit it.
GetMotivated,fe7z2nq,t1_fe7wx2z,1578920690.0,"You're right, the suffering in this world is only sustained by apathy. Truely malicious people are far outnumbered by the apathetic and the malicious would be powerless if there was no apathy. We're all guilty of it to an extent, some far more than others. If it eats you up it's no longer apathy. Regret means you're changing for the better, that's great. Some people go their whole lives not giving a sh!t about the suffering they caused. If there is justice at the end of this life I'll gladly pay my price knowing that I truely deserve it and that it is fair."
GetMotivated,fe7bxyv,t1_fe7b85n,1578912554.0,Not possible in my experience. You have to go by their actions. I've seen people who seem like lovely people do horrible things and people who seem like monsters do very kind things.

GetMotivated,fe7a1br,t3_enz7gg,1578911974.0,True. Small acts of cruelty (including apathy) also have a tremendous impact.
UpliftingNews,fe79rjy,t1_fe7951i,1578911840.0,You're doing a great job at not arguing since you said you would stop three posts ago. Who would have thought someone who thinks people are not responsible for their actions also has no integrity?  That doesn't make complete sense at all. Since you seem to have no self-control (which explains why you don't want to be responsible for your actions) I'll end it for you.

UpliftingNews,fe6uyw3,t1_fe6u2bw,1578905704.0,Incorrect. I judge their apathy as monstrous. People are being killed and are suffering greatly everyday because of it.
UpliftingNews,fe6ugx4,t1_fe6tt2p,1578905529.0,Apathy is the reason the vast majority of suffering in the world can be sustained. It would be a vastly different world without it.
UpliftingNews,fe6tkhu,t1_fe6t8gg,1578904834.0,"It says volumes about your values. If you're not willing to stand up against people doing horrible shit with your money and in the name of your country then yes, you're a very bad person and if there is a god you'll answer for that when you die.  Hopefully by being born into a country destroyed by the US. It's very hard to respect someone like that. Especially when all they had to do was turn up and vote. Not fight in a war, not weather a chemical attack, just turn up and vote."
UpliftingNews,fe6tdef,t1_fe6t60g,1578904541.0,Why don't you know who you're voting for if they are not anonymous?
UpliftingNews,fe6tbtj,t1_fe6t4aj,1578904476.0,The government's actions are only possible because of the lack of opposition in most people and ample apathy.
UpliftingNews,fe6t6z1,t1_fe6t104,1578904281.0,Obviously you are. Not voting is a vote for the winner. Trump would never have got in if the people who stood the most to lose voted against him.
