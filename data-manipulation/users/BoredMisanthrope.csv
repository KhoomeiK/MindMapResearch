gaming,fen8z2q,t3_epzmh8,1579279574.0,"My guess is this is something he might have did with his dad, maybe the only thing, and he's trying to recreate it. They grew up with such positive memories of it when they were a kid that they desperately want you to feel the best part of what they felt growing up.

But parents also need to understand that their kids are separate people. With separate interests and separate experiences. No matter how hard he tries, his experience of it will not be your experience of it.

I grew up being forced to play soccer. Hated it. Thus hated soccer for a long time. Wouldn't watch it or anything. Then I watched the world cup on year and was like, hey, this isn't bad. Still didn't watch leagues or anything. Next world cup, more into it. Then the next, and after that cup was over I was like, let me check out my local team.

Just bought season tickets this upcoming year. Which is to say, interests can't be forced. You find things on your own. That's something maybe you should talk to your parent about.

This also reminded me of the fact most games my dad had no interest in but I do remember he enjoyed Top Gun and Ace Combat, the flying games. I remember being a kid and we set beach chairs out in the living room because the Playstation controller didn't reach any regular chairs. I hadn't thought about that for years until just now. 

All that's to say, maybe soccer isn't it but keep trying to find something and ask he do the same."

gaming,fcsuzer,t1_fcsnrkx,1577925781.0,"My recommendation is go indie. Get humblebundles and cheap subscriptions. Play the stuff you've never heard of and can't imagine playing. Give it an hour anyway.

I spent 180 dollars on the last 3 AAA games, all for a combined play time of 3 1/2 hours. Some random ass tower defense game I'd never heard of that I got in a humblebundle? 26 hours play time.

They Are Billions which I only played because I had gotten the EA access thing on a whim? 270+ hours. The Long Dark, random game I don't even remember how I came across but figured ""eh, why not"", 450+ hours.

We live in an age where big budget titles get hyped to epic proportions, shoved in our faces, told by review publications the game is the next coming of christ, a chorus of followers echo chambering around the internet about how amazing it is to be part of the in crowd who got there first... And then many of us sit down to play it and go ""... Wha? People made a big deal about this? Maybe I'm just not really into gaming anymore"".

Gaming didn't change. The industry around it did because the amount of money going into it now. It's not a niche hobby anymore. It's big business. And it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Big titles take less risks, stick to formulas that have proven themselves, just like the movie business.

It's like music. There's still great music out there getting made, but you won't find it on the radio. Not usually. Sometimes good and profitable collide and we win out. But usually, it's whatever product hits the lowest common denominator. Gaming is like that now, the big titles are rarely going to be the most fun. If for no other reason than the winning formula of the day is already getting played out to death."

AmItheAsshole,fc4csf8,t3_efwmzz,1577412932.0,"Yta mostly because of how you over reacted. I understand with her being 8 months pregnant, alone, closing a business, that she's an opportune target for criminal activity. For everybody out there saying ""oh this is normal for the industry"" or whatever else, not anywhere I worked. Closing up by yourself at night is a major security issue and not something any business I've worked at would allow. Male, female, pregnant or not, you make yourself a target right off the bat just by being alone.

Considering she's carrying your soon to be born child, I get being extra nervous about the whole situation. Texting your brother asking ""why is she alone"" and demanding it be brought up next meeting, you overstepped your role here. Proper way about it is once your wife is home tell her why her being alone in that situation is not okay, and tell her you hope she will bring it up so that work doesn't allow ANYBODY be in that position.

As for the people saying you're being sexist, honestly, that's nonsense. While a male should not be in that situation either, an 8 month pregnant woman is undoubtedly more vulnerable. And I'm not saying drunk guy would do anything, but if somebody decides to do something criminal, the criminal isn't going to worry about whether his victim selection process is sexist or discriminatory.

Still, I have to go with Yta because despite not much you could do, you managed to overstep with her boss and be disruptive and perhaps even distracting her in this situation.

But unlike most, I don't think your nervousness and displeasure of the situation is unwarranted. And I sympathize, even though I think you handled it poorly."
