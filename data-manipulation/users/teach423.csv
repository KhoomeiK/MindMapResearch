Makeup,ff7wmh9,t3_erwffy,1579660103.0,Watched a girl straight up pick up a lipstick once and put it on. I was shook.
onguardforthee,ff7wh3w,t1_ff69nxl,1579660004.0,Nah man. I'm a teacher. If a kid gets hurt on their way home from school we are 100% liable. Not saying it makes sense but it's the truth.
todayilearned,feilunw,t1_fefou89,1579141561.0,"Oh funny Canada geese story! I used to work at a swimming pool that had a pond and Park area near it and some lady came running in holding her kid (3-4 years old) who was covered in blood. We all assumed he had been hit in the parking lot or something. Nope, he was chasing a goose and got attacked. Some Band-Aids and ice and he was all good. 

The scream they let out when you get to close is in every Canadian's nightmares."

My go to response is ""You know what I do like having this much time off. If you want you can go get th same degree as me and also become a teacher. Lots of districts are hiring."" That shuts them up pretty fast."
AskReddit,fd5lymx,t3_ek07fx,1578178897.0,"As a Canadian I think this is going to end poorly. It's going to be so cold inside. Also, so mosquito-ey in about May."
AskReddit,fc5qihl,t3_ega9qc,1577463767.0,"Rerack your weights for the love of God. I had a guy leave 4 45lbs plates on a squat rack once. He left it on the very top wrung though. I'm 5'2"", I did not get to do squats that day."
AskReddit,fb99pts,t3_ebuquu,1576632995.0,"""When are you having kids?""

I just started my masters and my husband just finished his PhD a year and a bit ago. We want to enjoy being adults with disposable income for a bit before we make babies. I don't feel like getting into a discussion about how much I like sleeping in, smoking weed, and online shopping with every third person I talk to."
