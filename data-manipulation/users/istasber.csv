I don't know how it works in witcher, but someone else implied that it was similar to Skyrim in that the shops refresh on regular schedules. If the goal of having limited shop currency is to promote scarcity as a gameplay mechanic, then it's horribly unbalanced as implemented since you can just rest at the inn or quick travel between shops to circumvent it.

There's no good rational in-universe reason for a vendor to have unlimited currency, but unless you have some kind of complicated economic system in place where realism is an important piece of the gameplay, you're just making things tedious and obnoxious by having a limited currency.

Marx-leninism, the authoritarian system that's the basis for communism as a political party, was based on marx's works, but it wasn't something marx himself advocated. For example, Marx viewed communism as the inevitable consequence of capitalism, and was a huge opponent of socialism because he viewed it as a way for capitalists to retain power without addressing the real issues of capitalism. Marx-leninism views communism as something that has to be implemented by a government, and views socialism as a necessary step towards that implementation. It's an entirely different philosophy."

People are making a big deal about how close we are to the cap, but the window's not closed yet. I get why people want to blow everything up, it's exciting to see everything built from the ground up, but that's not gonna happen until the GM and coach get fired, and I don't think were anywhere near that yet with as good as Zimmer's record has been and as good as we've drafted over the past few years."

Cuts/trades/restructures/extensions could go a long way to reducing cap hit.
