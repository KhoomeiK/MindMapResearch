MonsterHunterMeta,ffxfq7n,t1_ffxbtbh,1580324231.0,"Fair enough, and I completely agree. 

The weirdos like me that want to hyper-optimize everything, but can’t survive any MR fight without HB3 thrive on these subs. Also, I looooove build variety and genuinely appreciate other people doing the same. For example: *whispers* I play elemental greatsword **and** hammer. 

Do you have a good build for that support set btw? I always try to do support but I’m so dang bad at it. What weapon would you recommend? Disregard if it was purely hypothetical. 

I also genuinely appreciate you seeing that I wasn’t being argumentative and being super chill about both of our opinions. It’s so refreshing."
MonsterHunterMeta,ffx76ti,t1_ffx5kga,1580319180.0,"Completely agree. The posts like this that are “I want max deeps while maintaining xy and z skills, any recommendations” is, in addition to the meta compilations, what this sub should be for. 

Just had to chime in on my guy getting decimated by a crowd of anti-toxxers.

Edit; sorry, I forgot to mention the point: if the entire purpose is comfort and not “I’m optimized but want these skills-help” or something similar, and is instead: “I’m doing this, nah I don’t want that” then maybe a different sub is suitable. And for dang sure a contributor shouldn’t be bombed for suggesting such. 

Isn’t the inherent anxiety about being called elitist scum so super fun? I’m assuming we all hate it too and that’s why we came here."

Interestingly enough, the second time I stumbled into the ending that has you fight your dad in Hirata. So I went Shura, Return, Purification, Immortal Severance."

monsterhunterclan,ffic9y8,t3_etqgqk,1579970446.0,"Sorry if you already know this, but a little tip about arena quests: they’re puzzles. 

They are designed to be “figured out” for each weapon loadout and monster. For example, banbaro arena quest he has a very low KO and paralysis threshold compared to a normal banbaro so the idea is to lock him down with the para hammer loadout while another hunter does MAX DEEPS or whatever. 

Each loadout has clues like in the Zinogre quest, the greatsword has slugger 5 and punish draw. So clearly the idea is to knock him out using the impact mantle and draw attacks and creat openings for the damage focused longsword loadout. 

I hope that makes sense and helps a little bit."
monsterhunterclan,ffic0oq,t3_etqxpj,1579970273.0,That matches up with my play schedule perfectly! I’m MR300something but with the health these MR monsters have it won’t be apparent that I’m late-game.

I feel like Jho’s roar got nerfed in Iceborne because it was impossible to roll thru in base game but in Iceborne it’s easy to get thru. 

I know that last bit was out of nowhere but it came to mind and I think jho and hazak roars were mentioned in the video I linked as being unrollable"

Wide 6 is markedly weaker in Iceborne than it was in base game. Theoretically the best DPS comes from Normal 7, however, in practice, long 6 is king for now. This is strictly speaking in terms of a normal non-scripted hunt. 

When I play GL I play Long 6 if I want to mindlessly farm (it’s so safe it’s basically easy mode but it’s still fun) and Wide 6 if I want to have some high octane button-mashing while practicing my evade hopping."

MonsterHunterMeta,ffegr56,t3_et6hj0,1579847380.0,"Long, normal, and wide Gunlance are essentially 3 different weapons. 

For long Gunlance, you spam charged shells, an optimal safi Long GL has 
-Shelling Long lvl6
-Slot upgrade IV
-Sharpness V x 3

Wide is a poke, boom, poke, boom, repeat playstyle and you’ll want to put some damage in there as well. My wide6 safi I think has 
-Wide shelling lvl6
-Attack V
-Attack VI
-Sharpness V x 2
***because you won’t be building around status, the values are incredibly low and remain that way. I experimented with all the different statuses and blast was the only one that procced at least once in every test with most instances bearing multiple procs 

Normal Gunlance I didn’t build from safi but it would look similar to wide. The normal GL playstyle is full-burst spam (quick reload, slam, release all shells, slap, quick reload, repeat)

Edit: sorry I didn’t see the bottom part. Yes, Gunlance always always runs Zorah 3 piece and artillery 5. 
Essentially Long Gunlance needs 
-Artillery 5
-Focus 3
-Capacity boost 
-whatever you want

Wide GL needs
-Art 5
-guard 3 minimum
-attack and affinity boost 
-sharpness loss mitigation
-whatever you want

Normal
-art 5
-same as wide

The guard skills are a bit more important in Iceborne and I run guard 5 on all my GL sets because the knock-back is REEEEAL heavy and especially the poke-shell wide play-style really takes a hit in damage uptime if you’re getting guard stunned left and right. 

Last note, your hop has iFrames just like a roll (not sure if they’re less or the same). iFrames are in the beginning of the hop, so learn to use it so you can just jump rope thru roars and other stuff. I also highly recommend evade extender as a QoL skill."

LSAT,ff0cpqs,t3_er2263,1579467611.0,"The LSAT is a very difficult test if you’re unprepared. It would not be a shocking thing if the best student you know scored a very low score on the test if they did not study. 

With that warning out of the way, the general answer for LSAT studying is to find old LSATs and take those over and over. This method is only effective if you have an answer key that explains why the correct answer is correct and the wrong answers are wrong, this is often referred to as a “supplement.” 

Further, there are courses both online and in-person that your boyfriend can purchase that will help. These classes have have mixed reviews but both sides of the “does it work” coin concede that it is not a complete waste of time. It’s just very expensive relative to other methods of study so the value assessment is probably skewed accordingly. 

Finally, there are unpaid and “free” routes like finding LSAT study books from a library or using YouTube or Khan Academy to study. This is not going to be the best way to go for many reasons but the main two, in my opinion, is a lack of structure/order and as with most things, you get what you pay for. 

I hope this helps."

The little pops when the sword is amped, the massive damage potential when you’re hitting through dead bodies and teammates (anything that’s alive or was once living procs your amped phial Bursts) and a super sick Ultimate move. 

Switch axe is my favorite weapon (tied with Gunlance cuz explosions) and muuuuuuch easier to master than CB. You should still play CB, it’s super fun too, but SA is where it’s at. 

Couple things: master the fade slash, master morphing out of combos instead of stopping to switch manually, master morphingng out of combos BACKWARDS to create distance, and master the art of the hop. 

Final note: evasion skills on switch axe are highly recommended from me. Extender is the best option for me because Switch Axe rewards positioning. Evade window skill gives extra iFrames on hops than a normal roll."
