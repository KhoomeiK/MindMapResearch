Maybe you could try to get the same benefits/feeling from something else ? Weighted blankets, heated pad, maybe snuggle in your warm bed and do some guided meditation... Overall I think understanding why this is so soothing for you might help !"
trashy,fftd5zx,t1_fftaf3q,1580217017.0,"I would consider ""highlighting that she's displayed some questionable behavior"" equal to saying she has flawed opinions so we shouldn't listen to her, ie cancelling her. 

Even without that, you're going ad hominem, which I also denounce !
You're not saying ""her argument is wrong because x"", you're saying ""SHE is wrong because of personal views and because SHE is a bad person""."

selfimprovement,fe763hz,t3_eo05yr,1578910565.0,"I have the exact same issue, except I don't always manage to at least feed myself and clean, so, y'know, good job !
Try to get healthier, sleep regularly and enough, eat well, exercise, maybe meditate.

If that doesn't seem to work, go to the doctor, get some blood tests done, check for thyroid issues, or food intolerance if you also have some digestive issues for example."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fde0j22,t1_fddue4g,1578328421.0,"I think it's a crystallization of sexist ""rules"" in society, ie women shouldn't be ""slutty"" and seek sex, but the man should want her and seduce her. Put that to the extreme and women feel guilty enjoying sex so they like feeling forced or brutalized because then it's not their ""fault"" if they're having sex (and enjoying it). And men feel pride in submitting a woman they seduced or coerced I guess.
This is speculation but it's how I explain the existence of my own kinks, which are also light BDSM stuff. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fcv7n3q,t1_fcuz8mr,1577996336.0,"Which is a description of her. She is currently a woman with hairy armpits, so he finds her gross."
AmItheAsshole,fcv7i4s,t1_fctz9i3,1577996251.0,"She didn't insult him and call him gross, she said how she liked it better, just as a guy will say you look pretty with your long hair or this particular dress. 
And thankfully the general opinion is evolving towards acceptance of natural body hair :)"

I also don't like shaving and I'm stopping/reducing my shaving, and my partner did have an opinion and preferences, which he expressed respectfully and I took into account.
He didn't call me gross or disgusting, he just said what he liked more. There is room here for a polite request from him, exactly as you did for his beard.

FYI, I started trimming instead of shaving to have short and discreet armpit hair without damaging and irritating my skin, using an electric beard trimmer, and I really love this solution. It was a suggestion from my bf who isn't a fan of armpit hair, but didn't want me damaging my skin :)"

Beans, salsa, corn, rice, cilantro, onions, peppers, salad, fresh tomatoes, and if not vegan, add cheese and/or sour cream.
