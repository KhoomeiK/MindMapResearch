Then when she had a kid (before I knew her) and really needed something safer, swapped her his newer Accord (he drove the Civic until just recently, when he traded it for a new Accord Sport 2.0T manual). She drove the Accord well into our marriage until kid #3 was on the way, at which point we caved to convenience and traded the Accord on an Odyssey (those who think a 3-row SUV is a good substitute for a vehicle with power sliding doors when you have 3 kids in car seats are downright foolish). 

We road tripped the shit out of that van. Tearing ass across the great plains, sometimes at triple-digit speeds. Flying down dirt roads in Montana, tossing it through corners like the world's biggest rally beast. Driving up trails that warned ""4x4 only"" until it ran out of traction or ground clearance. 

Only sold it because the wife wanted something new and the kids were older and out of car seats, so we didn't need the sliding door convenience as much. So she got a Pilot. And we've continued the road tripping and hard use, only now adding towing to the mix with a camping trailer. It's got 152k on it now, and I've just rebuilt the brake calipers and replaced the front CVs. It really needs shocks and outer tie rods soon, too. But all of those are maintenance items, and we expect them to wear out more quickly with the way we use it.

We'll probably keep this one a long time, too, as our oldest is beating driving age, and a car/insurance for them will consume the new car budget for a while. I'm sad Honda hasn't been making a car like the Leaf, because an EV is what I really want to get for the kids. They don't need a ton of range, and maintenance is minimal.
