UnresolvedMysteries,ffggrlg,t1_fffyss7,1579905878.0,"Human nature is to panic in these situations. I would imagine it's similar to people ODing and someone dumping the body, which is unfortunately pretty common."
ColoradoSprings,fff96ls,t1_fff8qj9,1579878812.0,"No, I used people making poor choices as an example. Why does no one accept accountability for their actions? Why is everyone giving me shit, and not the cop then? Lol, it's like jr high in here. The cop didnt rig up the other person's car and then push the pedal down with their secret cop powers.. the other person made a choice to race. Do you use this theory when your kids try drugs? ""Well the other kid offered my kid drugs, so they entrapped my kid and made them do drugs."" Im sorry, WHAT?"

GERD,ffdw00o,t3_et2k5r,1579830306.0,"I'm sorry, I absolutely adore Obama, but I dont see this as a huge ""milestone for our community."" A lot of people have this, and I'm sorry, but we dont need celebrities to ""draw awareness."" We might be miserable, but if you think about it, we are actually pretty damn lucky that our gut bacteria is all that's wrong, when there are people out there suffering FAR much worse than we are. Yes, this sucks, but it's manageable, unlike many other things that need awareness brought towards."
