PA Announcer, to me, has always been probably the coolest job in the world. We have a good one in Seattle, Tom Hyutler. He's been doing it since 1987 back in the Kingdome. His voice is one of the best I've ever heard through a PA system. I can vividly hear his voice in my head doing some of my favorite players back then:

*Designated Hitter Edgarrrrr MarrrrrTINEZ!*

*Right fielder Jayyyyyy ByUHner!*

On top of his great voice, the way he says the visiting players' names is badass as well. He's not all happy when saying their names, other ballparks' PA announcers often sound too happy to be announcing the away team's batters. You always know when the good guys are batting if you're walking into the stadium a little late or you're chillin' out on the concourse."

He was meowing a lot and seemed very lost and scared so I hung with him for a little while, even went in and got some of my cat's food and water, he didn't touch it but I think he was grateful because he gave me some head bumps. Hope he found his way home."
