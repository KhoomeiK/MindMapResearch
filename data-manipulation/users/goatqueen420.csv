Symbology,ffdr0io,t3_et1btw,1579826830.0,"Looks to be an upside down Odal or Othala Rune. 
It means """"heritage; inheritance, inherited estate"" in Elder Futhark. 

They might be a witch/ follower of Norse paganism. 

Extremely unfortunately Neo-Nazis have made an attempt at appropriating the symbol for their means. 
They have some sort of ""Heritage"" complex that all land rightly belongs to the aryan race or some backwards dumb shit like that. It is absurd and disgusting and unfathomably wrong. 

It's lesser known than a swastika so more people can get away with it. 

Needless to say the Pagan community is pretty angry and defensive of the whole ordeal. 

Some more info on the rune: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odal_(rune)

You're laying there, your face is gone, you're breathing through your bloodied bones and the last thing you hear is laughter..while they poke you and watch you wiggle.


Horrific.
