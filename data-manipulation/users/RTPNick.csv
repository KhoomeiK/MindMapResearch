politics,ffhel60,t3_etco84,1579932037.0,"GOP Republicans just do your job and abide by the oaths you've taken. The Senate as we have seen (Merrick Garland, impeachment trial format) can set it's own rules for evidence. Trump can only obstruct if the GOP lets him."

politics,ffattvx,t1_ffa8sxp,1579744341.0,Pulling out was not the way to handle it. Trump gave up the seat at the table. The other countries still in the agreement don't want to deal with a dumbass the continues to make matters worse. He is a whiner and liar. A whining liar. Iran de-escalated the situation by strategically limiting their attack. Unfortunately they were trigger happy and downed a passenger plane.

politics,ff9xn9q,t1_ff7b2gs,1579723732.0,Probably a good idea. Which is why the nuclear agreement was negotiated and enacted. Apparently it was working until dumbass withdrew the US from it. Now he's whining to try and reestablish one. Unfortunately he thinks killing Salimondi and additional sanctions will bring them back to the negotiating table.

politics,feh222h,t1_fegwryb,1579107515.0,"Probably has to do with AG Barr. However, I imagine it is being investigated on the DL and hopefully will be revealed later. Maybe 1) after the impeachment trial, 2) during the lead up to the election or 3) after the election should the Dems win back the presidency. Hopefully all three."
