SuicideWatch,fdkq9ij,t3_elu4me,1578508903.0,I'm honestly feeling the exact same way right now
SuicideWatch,fdcmrrs,t3_ekn1fa,1578278779.0,I'm a freshman in highschool in the same situation. I've learned there is no way to truly be in control. The thing that is keeping me alive is thinking how others will feel. My grandma died a year ago and I remember the feeling of pain at the funeral. The thought of that feeling being in my few friends and my family is the only thing keeping me going

SuicideWatch,fdc8q7t,t3_eklels,1578269305.0,"I also feel unworthy of people I know, if i had any advice I would say to try to keep people close. What's keeping me alive right now is worrying about others emotions for when I'm gone. The emotions of the 5 people who truly care about me"
SuicideWatch,fdc71rp,t3_ekl5nk,1578268363.0,"Life sucks and so do people, over half the people of the world are jerks and it's sad, but the common population doesn't care. It hurts when it's people society paints as people who should respect you, like your parents. I am now realizing that what society says isn't true, parents are like any other person. They have high chances to be jerks. Think of them as just people, random strangers, and I don't think it will hurt as much. I don't know where I meant to go with this but I hope this post makes you feel better in some way. Happy birthday"
