I still reach for him at night while I sleep. Driving home from work I still have a glimmer of hope to see the lights on as I turn up the drive. I miss his laugh,his jokes, his witt, his handsome brown eyes. I miss his love and I miss our future. I got this tattoo as a symbol of out love - Absolutely I Do - Is what he said to me at the alter, it's the lovers tarot mixed with death. My fire for him will be eternal. 
17yrs we were together it's hard to believe, we were just kids. I hate I have to stay here and live without him . Nothing is as good and warm, or happy now that he's gone."

firstimpression,ffdd3kv,t3_eszn1n,1579818341.0,You don't look mad. You have nice eyes. You look like you have a sense of humor. A little arrogant perhaps. You excel at most things and are pretty happy dude. Have bit of temper behind closed doors.
AskWomen,ffdbmx1,t3_eswj5k,1579817408.0,"I moved for my husband to a tiny coastal town that I had never heard of. We had been dating 2yrs on and off and had only lived together 6mo. We moved back to his home town for work. It was so, so hard. He knew everyone, had history with people that I didn't know or understand. I hated the town, the lack of amenities, the weather, the small town gossip. It was hard and I did resent him at first, we fought a lot. Only reason we made it, is because we are both stubborn mules.

I got a job, I made my own friends, not just his buddies girlfriends. I tried new sports and activities that were popular in community. I put myself out there and I tried.  It was really hard and lonely at times. It took a solid year before I even remotely started to think of this place as home. It's been 14 or 15 years now, I'm still here."
widowers,ffclv1n,t3_esi25a,1579802213.0,"Such a hard decision to ""let them go"" 
My husband never told  what he wanted done with his aches. I have an idea where they should go, I'm just not ready to do that yet. 
I dont want to sound cheesy but truly he is all around you. He's part yourself, because he helped make you the person you are.  Your memories and sense of self is part of him.  I wish there are a easy switch to all this pain we carry.  Best of luck to you. Pamper yourself and lean on your support system."

books,ffb38kz,t1_ffavp6b,1579750656.0,"I dont normally read these type of novels. Lately I've needed to distract myself with minimal effort. So I picked one of Karin Slaughters, I read it in an afternoon. If you like her books,  I reccomend -Sometimes I lie, twisty and easy read. Chevy Stephen's she also similar in style."
