SweatyPalms,ff89i01,t1_ff6xoad,1579669974.0,"None of the answers here suggest heli logging. It's done on the coast of bc, the loggers have to ""top"" the tree like this, then at the bottom they cut the trunk almost all the way, so when the hell comes and lassos the tree it snaps with a gentle tug and the heli flies away with the tree. To save time from climbing down and back up, they will toss a line to the tree next to them (if there is one nearby) and swing over, topping a bunch in a row before coming down"

diydrones,ff0zszj,t3_eqwdf2,1579473854.0,"So a 1-in diameter hose a 100-ft long filled with water will weigh around 16kg, so you're well within the ""heavy lift drone"" category. A quick Google search tells me the best guy on the market can only lift 30 kg and the next runner-up can lift 20. so once you add the pressure nozzle and all of the other equipment you need to have on it you're probably having to design a drone that can compete with the best ones on the market. What's your level of drone building experience?

You'd be crazy to try and have it battery-powered if you're already running a hose of the ground, so now you have to deal with boosting the voltage so that you can compensate for the drop over a 100ft. I'm not sure how many amps it would be drawing under normal operation but You're also going to have to fight the forces of the pressure washer and nozzle.

finally, would you even legally be able to fly this beast? You probably have to have all sorts of certifications to fly something like this in my country but I have no idea what your local laws are. 

Do I think it could be done for under 15k?  Yes, but I'm assuming the cost of learning how to do so is not included. When a single mistake can cost you your drone learning can be a very expensive process. That's also assuming your time is not worth money either.

I'd say if 15K gets you the drone you need and you think you can make money off that investment definitely don't bother trying to make your own"

It can also cause corrosion over time. freshwater however is not very conductive and will not short circuit your boards.
