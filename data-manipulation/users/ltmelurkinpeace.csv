TumblrInAction,fge464d,t1_fge3kp8,1580690968.0,"Another thing that we often see is that men will attempt to belittle each other and others when they feel that their masculinity is being called into question. Which is part of why toxic masculinity is so hard to address in many cases. The toxic elements of masculinity have been ingrained in our sense of what it means to be masculine in our society. This makes it doubly hard to address with men who haven't already realized there are elements of masculinity that lead to negative outcomes for men over and over again. Of course some men will also say ""you are harming men"" when pointing out that there are toxic elements that are reinforced by society that can, and should, be addressed. The only way that is true is if we assume that those elements are integral to masculinity and are the core features of masculinity as opposed to a byproduct of multiple systems within our society."

The self-destructive tendencies that tend to make men not listen well to deeper issues, not seek help unless there are clear physical problems, that make men fear being seen as ""weak"" by their peers, etc. Of course this CAN be addressed over time but one of the biggest hurdles to overcome on addressing it is men themselves and their self-reinforcing of these ideas, because part of toxic masculinity almost requires one to not accept it's existence in the first place."

Another issue is men are significantly less likely to seek help (by a magnitude of around 11x) if they haven't been physically injured but only mentally/emotionally hurt. Seems to me there is an underlying issue of men not seeking out or accepting help when it is offered and THAT issue needs to be addressed or overcome before we can just throw money at trying to help men the same way we help women within our society. We put funds where they will hopefully be used, and men are way less likely to use funds allocated for shelters (of all kinds)."

Refusing help for some other reason as opposed to their peers of other groups.

facepalm,fg5zkci,t1_fg5z2v1,1580545948.0,"Gender is social.  Not sure why you are conflating sex and gender by trying to say gender is the biological aspect.

Edit: to clarify for anyone that happens along. To the best of my understanding, sex is what is generally considered the biological aspect. As in your characteristics you were born with that have to do with sexual reproduction and how one would procreate. Generally accepted as the Male and Female of our species. There is also intersex, which can display in a variety of ways and one may never know they are intersex through their entire life because it may never become an issue. One may not be able to ""change"" what sex they were born as, or be able to procreate as the other sex, currently. It is possible to undergo processes that change many of the aspects associated with sex though, including genitalia.

Sex is distinct from gender, but often has some (or a lot) of overlap dependent on a lot of factors. One big factor is the culture in a given area, and is often why gender is considered a largely social construct. While one's sex interacts, in some cases, with one's gender that is not a rule. Gender, by and large, is used to refer to how one presents themselves to others within a society and ties, loosely, into how they function within a society. As society changes over time as do the gender roles and norms, and the way they are used. Which is something we observe by looking back at history in our own culture and in the culture of other areas."

Oh, and just for fun gonna edit again. Don't know why, just so I can? I'm just having fun editing at this point because someone is getting angry about me editing to try and be more clear while simultaneously being upset I wasn't clear enough in the first place. Also, the gaslighting was attempting to convince me of what I intended to try and convey. Since you seem to not actually understand what gaslighting is and that trying to convince someone they actually meant x when they keep telling you they meant y and apologize if they mistakenly made you think they meant x. You tried to gaslight, it has nothing to do with ""acting crazy"" or me constantly admitting I did a poor job of presenting my idea initially and correcting it and you still acting like you knew I meant something else.

I also didn't miss that they would have earning potential afterwards, I specifically left that out (and even outlined this elsewhere, but can't blame you for not seeing it) because it was about getting the two more extreme numbers and the actual income, for most athletes, would be somewhere between depending on a TON of other factors that can't really be accounted for in a ""general case"" like I was making.

Because with most professional sports you can't reasonably look at how much they make a year and just stop there. You need to look at how much they can make over their lifetime because many time its hard for them to do other things due to the stress and injuries their body goes through.  


So, for example, if someone makes 7.8m a year but is only able to play at that level for 5 years they will have made 39m. That 39m will need to last them till they die, unless they have other skills to fall back on, and even then they will likely need that 39m to supplement their medical expenses depending on where they live (some countries the medical expenses would be null so. . .). So if they live to 70 and their career ended in their 20s, they would be making closer to 800k or so a year. Which is a LOT easier to see someone living comfortably (even easier if they live extravagantly) and ending up blowing through in a year as opposed to a few million. Its one of the reason we see a lot of professional sports folks end up bankrupt because they didn't have the mentality ""This is what I'm making in my lifetime"" and instead ""this is what I'm making every year.""
