Documentaries,fdoono4,t1_fdn7r48,1578609458.0,"It definitely happens. I went to visit Hebron ~4 years ago. The streets have steel netting covering them so the settlers can’t throw rocks at the locals, so now they throw human waste. Some streets have put up tarpaulins.

We had lunch with a very nice Muslim man who was also very angry with the settlers. Every day they walk past his house and many others to remind them they are in charge. There are soldiers everywhere, some with grenade launchers. There was a shooting in the mosque in 1994 resulting in 30 dead (shooter included) and 125 injured. 

Because we were New Zealanders, we could go wherever we wanted. Our tour guide had to walk a different route to get to our lunch area. We walked down the road for 3 mins, he had to go through 2 checkpoints and a circuitous route. There were parts of the tour where we would walk past the checkpoint freely and he would have to wait behind. 

Our tour guide told us they have a saying “Abused child, abusive parent”.
