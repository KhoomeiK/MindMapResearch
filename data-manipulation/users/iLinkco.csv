Entrepreneur,fecur0x,t1_fe6wpcl,1578985406.0,Really? Illegal? even if it's among friends and does not leak out? Have you ever done this? lost any money? please if you can share your experience i would be grateful.
Entrepreneur,fecuoda,t1_fe6xlhq,1578985322.0,Sure it is not secure. That's why they do it only with their closes friends and family and those who are really trustworthy.
Entrepreneur,fecumco,t1_fe6zoy6,1578985258.0,"Hmmm, didn't know it is a common system among many nations. Thank you for the information. I still want to try it myself."
Entrepreneur,fecuix2,t1_feba622,1578985152.0,"Yes, you are right, that would be more simple. But I guess they look at it also as a means of saving money."
aww,fd9jmbo,t3_ekaod3,1578234239.0,Oh! Incredibly beautiful! Look at those little cute paws!
aww,fd0i53w,t1_fcu4kmn,1578119142.0,"It's really sad how some people are willing others get harmed to get to what they want... If only we could see all the creatures and ourselves as one, then we could understand the pain they take, we would even ache with their pain... Thank you for caring, I really appreciate your standpoint and wish there are more people born and educated like you."
aww,fctxcy4,t1_fctunxu,1577964317.0,"I agree ... most of the terrible things happening in the world can be stopped if we care and not support them. If there is no customer to buy or adopt these poor animals, then the breeders will stop, for there will be no profit to be made by doing these terrible things to animals."
aww,fctvlcm,t3_eiwodg,1577961792.0,This is sooooooooooooo cute ... !
aww,fctuwzs,t1_fcttmhy,1577960809.0,"awwww... It's really sad... she is not my own, a friend of mine adopted her a few months ago. But what you just mentioned about how they suffer our urge for cute things... how cruel ... I'm really impressed... we need to ban such cruelties... I am a vegan and can't really see other creatures suffer because of us... 

Ps. and I'm not knocking your decision as well... just moved deeply by the fact you unveiled to me... and I am most thankful of you doing this"
Entrepreneur,fcdntas,t1_fc2hlix,1577611811.0,Glad you liked it and I'm sure you will find it very useful and helping many times in your life... actually it is a non-official Iranian system of loan invented by Iranian house-wives. I learnt it from one of my friends who's wife is Iranian... ;)
Entrepreneur,fc2ag8r,t3_efr5lf,1577348580.0,"How about this option:

a domestic loan with family and friends.

Works this way:

you tell your family and friends that here is a loan you are going to put, say for example $10000. it should be paid in 20 months, each month $500. the money goes to one person every month and every body must pay 500 dollars each month for 20 month. by drawing the names of participants every month the winner of each month is selected. But the first collection of money is yours as the holder and responsible person of it. This kind of friendly loan does work really good because there is no interest in the repay.

You can find more people and raise the total amount to what you need. take the first money collected and draw names every month and every body will finally get their money back."
