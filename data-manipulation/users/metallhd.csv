If you were using brand new media, a week is probably not long enough to cycle the tank properly.  As others have suggested, it's not that rare of a problem, but unfortunately there is a clear risk of losing all your fish without appropriate precautions.  With uncycled tanks the principal culprit is ammonia, but frequent water changes will help this.  Suggest to take a look at the FAQ here in the sub for advice and information on cycling.  If you have a friend who's a fishkeeper maybe ask them if they could give you some used filter media so you can jump start the cycle, assuming their setup is free of disease of course.

The whole scenario wreaks to high heaven, there are a myriad of odd details.  t may seem unlikely he committed suicide, but if the alternative was bringing criminality on the Royal Family and perhaps Trump, well maybe he did fall on his sword, it is probable to some degree that he was encouraged.  It seems very strange that an interview, even a bungled one, would force a Royal to withdraw, so perhaps there are something to those allegations as well, his mother is really pissed at him.  It certainly wasn't any legitimate accident, so that can be ruled out, but remember the case of Michael Hutchence when I say that, birds of a feather maybe.

Pros:  Vibrant city full of life, modern and relatively small population, just over a million.  Close to many natural wonders such as the Rocky Mountains (Jasper and Banff).  Home to the tallest Canadian building west of Toronto, which is directly across from the new arena which is home to many concert events\* and the Oilers of the NHL.  Known as the 'Gateway To The Klondike' because it literally was the stepping off point for prospectors on their way to the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 19th century.  The city has a modern light rail system in the midst of a giant upgrade, and an efficient public transportation system.  There are many city owned libraries and recreation centres of architectural distinction, and the library system was awarded ""Best In The World"" a few years ago also.  The city [gym](https://www.edmonton.ca/activities_parks_recreation/commonwealth.aspx) I go to is simply amazing, no other word. For people who enjoy the outdoors Edmonton is ideal - many outdoor facilities and parks exist, and the city itself is the closest to the northern wilderness and the Arctic in North America, hence its historical role. Camping, hunting, fishing, hiking, also all manners of winter recreation activity are readily available within a one hour drive.  Skiing in the Rockies is four hours away.   
 Edmonton is bisected by the North Saskatchewan River, which flows north to the Arctic Ocean, but comes from the Columbia Icefields.  Edmonton is a city of many cultures, with several large expatriate communities including Indian, Somali, and Vietnamese.  There are many languages spoken but English is prevalent of course.  There are many excellent restaurants; I am lucky enough to live in an area where there are perhaps 50 places within a 10 minute drive or walk, from Asian to fusion to chicken to bread.  Grocery stores are large and well stocked, Edmonton does have something of a foodie vibe, especially with all the famous summer festivals the city is known for.  \* apparently the city has some cachet among big artists as a good concert place, we get all kinds of shows.  Hello Shelbyville!  

Cons:  It's a hard hard place to be a hockey fan.  There is no downtown nightlife.  Like, pretty much zero.  It's like the French Quarter off Bourbon Street at night.  It's a city for cars, like Los Angeles.  It can be difficult to get around in the winter for many, especially the disabled, because of the snow, but there is an excellent disabled transport system also, and all city and other public facilities are accessible.  And oh yes, con number one for living here is maybe the biggest bragging right too lol.  It's just so. fucking. cold.  From December to February temperatures should be expected to dip below -30C, with windchill this past week bringing such temperatures as -50C (that's minus 60 F, America).  Windchill is a brutal thing - when it gets that cold even the slightest breath of a breeze is bitter, and if the wind is actually blowing your exposed flesh can freeze in under 5 minutes.  It's really, really cold.  The ironic thing is that it can be glorious out - not a cloud in the sky, and bright sunlight.   Good times!

mildlyinteresting,ff22sq5,t1_ff21zw8,1579492254.0,"There's an enormous amount of seemingly misplaced concern about Jeffery Epstein.  Had his death occurred in a novel or film you'd be cheering because he was morally reprehensible, and wealthy enough as a slimy financier to get away with it.  I have no doubt that neither his killer nor Khashoggi's shall ever be named, they will just sink back into the swamp.  Apart from a few bleeding heart conspiracy meme chasers, though, and unlike Khashoggi, no one really gives a flying fuck about Epstein.  Whether he did it or someone helped him along, the world is a better place.  Move on."
