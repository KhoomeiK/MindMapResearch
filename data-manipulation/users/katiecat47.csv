insaneparents,ffvw9t9,t1_ffvw3eg,1580275184.0,That’s totally fair! I meant more like how this post goes on and on and in a weird direction. A little more than just like hey that’s not cool and I’m upset.

insaneparents,ffvvm4j,t3_evh024,1580274592.0,I was always taught if you haven’t done anything wrong there’s not really any reason to get super defensive like this. Just my opinion!!!
Advice,ffqiizw,t1_ffpj76s,1580135557.0,"I COMPLETELY understand! I am the same way! I don’t know if it’s any comfort to you, but when I was able to finally get some help it changed my life! Obviously the OCD and anxiety doesn’t fully go away but life is a lot more manageable and neither runs my life anymore. My parents were like that too when I was growing up, but now that they’ve seen the difference treatment Has made for me they no longer feel the same and are very supportive. I hope you’re able to get some treatment ASAP and just know it is possible for it to be better and you’re NOT crazy!!!"

Also, is it possible you have some untreated anxiety? I know my anxiety can manifest in obsessing over one thing and becoming fearful about things that potentially may happen. Counseling has helped a lot. Just a thought!!!"

TalesFromYourServer,ffcuhue,t1_ffb4lkt,1579807516.0,Omg it’s the worst!! Especially because we make some of the food for to go orders too and the guys on the line yell out what they need. So if it’s just the items we make we get a written ticket but if it’s stuff they make too then they just yell out what they need from us and keep the ticket. It can get really chaotic sometimes. I always feel bad for new servers because it’s a lot at first.

Edit: also if the skin is hot to the touch that can indicate that there is infection. Not sure if that’s what you meant by red hot but I thought I’d throw that in."

AskReddit,ff9b20o,t1_ff94i9x,1579708898.0,She died from esophageal cancer. Quite different lol but I think maybe he was trying to be poetic. It also may help to know my grandparents had an obsession with eagles. Which was also fucked to my child brain because then we inherited said eagle stuff and to me it seemed fucked my grandma was killed by an eagle and our house was suddenly full of them.

insanepeoplefacebook,fehxor1,t3_ep8740,1579125942.0,Also I’m sure a pedophile isn’t going to post this on an adult site to bait kids??? People overreact so much and want everything to be something it’s not. And I agree with the comment about a kid being upset over a specific toy regardless of monetary worth. Mine got upset over an onion once. Kids are nuts.

AskReddit,fe855mu,t3_envws2,1578922698.0,We have opposite work schedules and don’t get to see each other much but we make sure we have one night a week together. I also pack his lunch and leave little notes every day and give him random snuggles and kisses. He will do little things for me too. Sometimes it’s just about making sure the other person knows you love them and that you appreciate them. It helps to know their “love language” too. Like my boyfriend is big in affection. I’m big in acts Of service. So we use those things too show the other they are loved.

facepalm,fe34217,t1_fe2ruhp,1578845737.0,Ritalin is methylphenidate. They use it to treat ADHD and such mostly in kids. In my case I was prescribed (kind of off label or whatever )a very low dose as a stimulant to help me have more energy.
AmItheAsshole,fe2wbve,t3_eno5q8,1578843579.0,NTA. Your friends bf is immature and probably freaks out when someone mentions a period. I’m guessing he also doesn’t know Bc is used for more than just not getting pregnant. Good for you for taking care of your health and life!!

AmItheAsshole,fcd8cat,t3_eh2uor,1577607618.0,NTA. My best friend in college was killed by a drunk driver. Anytime someone around me talks about driving drunk I politely bring up my friends death and how quickly one persons decision to drink and drive affected the lives of many people and caused so much pain. You are completely right to not want to contribute to this mans dumb decision to drink and drive. Plus he sounds like someone who is inconsiderate and also isn’t a particularly good friend to have.
