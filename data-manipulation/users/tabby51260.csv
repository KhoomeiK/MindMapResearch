Similar experience about a car following:

A friend and I were biking around our small rural town in summer. We were.. Probably 11 or 12? Anyways, we're just joking and going along and we notice this car behind us going slow. We go off to the side of the road so they can pass. Car doesn't pass. We think it's odd but whatever. We decide to take a turn. Car follows. We decide to go around a block in a circle. The car still fucking follows us. At this point we're starting freak out because - why the fuck is this car following us? So we go to a house we can see with a gate we think we can open. We put our bikes away like one of us lives there and just talk for a few seconds. The car slows and stops a second, then finally moved along.

I have no doubt that if we hadn't stopped at that random person's house we would have been raped or dead or something.

As an adult, I was visiting my parents and my dog wanted out at 10:30 at night. (Because she *always* did.) We were walking down the street and I just.. Felt odd. I heard a truck behind me and the guy kinda slowed down but still drove by. He was.. Kinda looking at me too. But whatever, truck went by end of story, right? The only thing is, I felt fear go through my body like I never had before. The second he took a turn my dog and I bolted back inside to my parents house (it was pretty close). It's damn good thing we did too. Peeking out of our window I saw the guy pull out of the neighbor's driveway that lives across the street (their house blocks the view to my parents house) and drive around the block multiple times.

I told a cousin about later, he'd had a similar truck tail him while he was on his bike at night and had the same thing happen when he took off through someone's yard and then hid. Truck went around looking for him.

Out of curiosity I looked on the sex offender registry and the guy who followed me looked a lot like one of the people registered. It wouldn't surprise me if it was that person and that it was the same one who'd tailed my cousin too."

I like his tv personality but the more I hear about how he treats the people who are supposed to be his friends the more I dislike him as a person."
masseffect,fdt4qni,t1_fds8x4t,1578711897.0,"Fuck, even if you live in a place with more affordable housing it's still not always feasible.

Like, student loans are killing my so and I over here haha. Plus, a lot of the houses that are for sale are newer and go for 250k-300k (compared to Brooklyn I know that's nothing!) But it's still pricey.

But hey, at least we have jobs and can afford the bills. It could be a lot worse. In a few years we should be able to have more disposable income. Just.. Gotta kill the loans."
politics,fdt2au4,t1_fdsy8tb,1578710992.0,"Not voting is part of why we are where we are now. I didn't want Hillary but swallowed my pride and voted for her anyways because I knew no matter what Trump would be worse.

If Biden somehow gets the nom and people abstain again we'll likely end up with another 4 years of trump.

It's not about who you like this next election, what's important is getting as many racist, misogynistic, assholes out of our government as possible."
GirlGamers,fdsddjf,t1_fdrrb15,1578700076.0,"And then there's me who varies by the game. Jedi Fallen order? 2nd highest difficulty. Kingdom Hearts? Critical. (Fuck me though it's hard.) Fire Emblem? Hard classic.

And then other games I just sorta go: Nah.. I'm in this for story. Like Mass Effect! I usually just play on normal. I'm not great at shooters so normal is the perfect amount of challenge. Witcher 3 I play on the 2nd easiest difficulty as well."
greysanatomy,fdrx26y,t1_fdrouif,1578690999.0,Yep! I never would have guessed Jo and Laura were the same person if it hadn't come up in a Google search haha!
greysanatomy,fdqla08,t1_fdqkpmg,1578669384.0,I mean year though. I assume it was before 2013?
Games,fdqboqr,t1_fdnipk5,1578662253.0,"But also, these expansions aren't being directed by Masuda. It's by that long haired dude who looked younger. My guess is that the younger newer developers might care more about what fans want than the older crew."
nightwish,fdqbaox,t1_fdoowpx,1578661908.0,"To be fair, I feel like Fahrenheit makes more sense depending on where you live. My state wildly varies in tempature throughout the year. Like... Summer can be 100 degrees (f. I think that's 32 C, right?) with 80% humidity while winter can get to -20 or lower. (While just dropping below 32 F would get you below 0 in celcius)"
greysanatomy,fdq85nz,t1_fdq30m0,1578658849.0,"Out of curiosity when did she join the show?

She's been voicing Lara Croft since 2013 in the Tomb Raider games and has always been awesome. That was also my first experience with her.

Edit: corrected Croft's name."

Source: started the demo and almost cried from happiness. The old sketchy art on menu is back too and my favorite one was the one I first saw. :')

Definitely going and pre-ordering tomorrow."
NintendoSwitch,fdo0x07,t1_fdnirve,1578596842.0,And the FF7 remake!

pokemon,fdn07os,t1_fdmzrr2,1578573170.0,"Compare them to HG/SS which had all Crystal content and extra additions like battle frontier.

ORAS had.. No Emerald content and outside of Zinnia, riding Latios/Latias, and catching basically every legend added nothing.

Hoenn is my favorite region and I'm still upset about what happened to ORAS."
AskReddit,fdllv3b,t1_fdlb390,1578526957.0,"A lot of anime don't though.

Violet Evergarden, Snow White with the Red Hair, Yona of the Dawn, Tokyo Ghoul, Wolf's Rain, Naruto, Black Butler, and a crap ton of other stories come to mind."
AskReddit,fdllp0c,t1_fdl6t7r,1578526848.0,"2nding Psycho Pass.

Tokyo Ghoul is another more serious show.. But has some supernatural elements. Same with Wolf's Rain, Shiki, Attack on Titan, Death Note, Fullmetal Alchemist.."

I've got an 8-year old cousin I always take time to spend time with at family gatherings. All of the other adults are definitely ""grown ups"" but there is no other child her age. Who else is gunna play with her?

All of the other adults (well.. Minus my husband and a cousin a few years younger than me) give me judgemental looks (especially my parents) but who gives a fuck?

She's having fun, I get to have fun and ignore my parents.. It's great!"

I sleep with them both."
