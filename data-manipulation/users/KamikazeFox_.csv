nfl,ff4wr56,t1_ff47jya,1579574296.0,Idk wtf I'm getting downvoted. It's a honest question about a new scenario involving gender mixing in the locker room.

Think if a make coach walked into a females locker room, it would be chill. No."
sports,ff43tw5,t1_ff43hjw,1579554937.0,"Ya, its exciting and om happy. And I agree about the Pat's this yr. They were very HoHum. Boring, not real play makers, dee was good but eh. 
I guess I can agree about the ppl tuning in to watch the game. But I still stand by the pats being the most loved and hated team around. 
Maybe we get Tua next yr and brady leaves. Will they still hate us?"

nfl,ff42nop,t1_ff3w4xb,1579554213.0,"This actually opened my eyes to why it is a big deal. At first I was like, "" so, she's just doing a job"". But the way you worded it honestly illuminated how it's for all females and showing what they can do. Its pretty cool.



BTW, prob so much hate bc for us guys, we don't have a equivalent to things like this. Any guy who breaks gender lines to do something females do, are often considered gay or feminine; thus most men not respecting what was done."
nfl,ff4267o,t3_erg8r0,1579553915.0,"I wonder what she does in the locker room. Just not look, wait until the dongs are away. I'm honestly curious. Being the first female coach, how does she deals with all these "" First time issues""."
