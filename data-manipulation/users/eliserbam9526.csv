AskReddit,ff98d5s,t1_ff81cr6,1579707202.0,"I can see why people are commenting about depression, but I feel like there's a difference in losing passion and energy for something rather than having no passion in the first place. I have very severe depression and on my worst days I can't do anything, but when I'm feeling a little better even the most trivial things like pizza will excite me because I'll remember how much I loved it in the first place. However someone I know didn't show any emotions the day we graduated uni, not even a smile, and she modelled what to do on what her sister did which to me shows a lack of passion or drive in the first place rather than losing it."
AskReddit,ff97zfc,t3_es53p0,1579706954.0,"Someone who shows no emotion or passion for anything. I know someone who is proud of not having cried in 5 years, which is fine for them I guess, but bragging about it just makes them seem almost robotic."

AskMen,fdms4z8,t1_fdmp9hd,1578563072.0,"I thought the exact same thing. When I had mine removed my partner came with me then took me home afterwards after stopping to pick up some sore-mouth-friendly foods e.g. ice cream, soup. It's not something I would ever dream of asking or expecting a coworker to do."
tifu,fdlm3fb,t1_fdk9s6l,1578527110.0,"Exactly. I'm 24, I work full time and I have a degree but I had a baby last year because we were ready and wanted one. I think had my situation been different we wouldn't have entertained the idea, regardless of our age, ie if I was in my thirties or forties and didn't have a job or an education I wouldn't have entertained the idea of even trying for a baby."
tifu,fdllyt8,t1_fdkg90r,1578527025.0,"I think your 20's are a funny age in that a lot of people are at different stages in their lives. I'm 24 and I have a 10 month old. I'm in a stable, almost 10 year relationship, we have our own house and both have good jobs. I also have a degree. I don't know settling down always seemed more appealing to me than living out my youth and partying. I'm happy, my partners happy and I'm sure if my son could talk he would probably say he's happy. A lot of the people I went to school with have also got at least one child and good jobs. My uni friends on the other hand are still living with their parents, they go on holiday regularly, go to concerts, clubs, drink etc and they also seem happy and I'm pleased for them.  My mantra is as long as you're happy, healthy, not hurting anyone and not in financial ruin then live and let live. Though maybe I'll have a terrible midlife crisis in the future."
TwoXChromosomes,fdlkt8i,t3_eluwox,1578526270.0,"Jesus Christ the longer you stay pregnant the more difficult an abortion procedure could potentially be! I feel like a lot of American doctors try to stop women from having an abortion just in case they change their mind when in reality it goes from taking pills to surgery or even labour in some cases. 

Also pregnancies can be difficult. Mine could've killed me and my baby. To think of someone going through what I went through for longer than they have to because they're not continuing with the pregnancy makes my blood boil. Just let the woman choose, not doctors, activists etc"
TwoXChromosomes,fdlkf14,t1_fdkxffe,1578526016.0,"Sorry you had to go through an abortion, but I'm so happy to hear you had such good care! Slightly different context when I found out I was pregnant as we were trying for a baby and said baby is now 10 months old, but when I went to the GP to confirm the pregnancy he outright asked me if I wanted to continue with the pregnancy or not. I feel like it's the norm over here to ask a woman what she wants to do and I'm sure if my circumstances were different I wouldn't have had any trouble getting an abortion. God bless the NHS!"

aww,fcxpx11,t1_fcvg1lb,1578068678.0,Yes to this! Babies do tend to breathe out of their noses at first but blankets shouldn't be any higher than their armpits. The fluffy blanket underneath and the soft kitten next to him also a big no!!
funny,fcufzy4,t1_fctkpga,1577980057.0,"This is (as far as I know) incorrect, or at least rare! Milk ducts sit behind the areola so a pierced nipple will unlikely affect the ducts themselves. However, some women notice milk leaking from the piercing holes. 

I'm no expert though. I've been breastfeeding almost 10 months, I attend breastfeeding support groups and researched almost every breastfeeding related problem possible."
funny,fcufsf0,t1_fctkcb6,1577979909.0,"There's a lot of misinformation on this comment. I looked this up the other day as I'm currently breastfeeding and my partner asked me if I'd consider getting my nipples pierced. From what I read, apparently milk will come out of the new holes and so more milk will come out if baby is in a position to stimulate milk flow from the new 'holes', but it won't increase/hinder milk production. So you'll still pump the same amount if you have a piercing as someone who doesn't. It's also recommended to take the piercing out during feeds."
funny,fcufih1,t1_fcu2u0k,1577979716.0,"I'm currently breastfeeding and most of the milk actually comes out of the nipple, not the areola.. at least mine does anyway! Some fluid comes out of the Montgomery's glands (areola bumps) but nowhere near enough to qualify as a feed"
