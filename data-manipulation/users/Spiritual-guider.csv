friendship,fcly2pb,t3_ehv1cr,1577759285.0,Sounds like a friend who doesn’t appreciate you and only uses you when they need you.
LastNight,fcj8m4e,t1_fcgqhxa,1577680024.0,"Thank you! I love writing, and I love to paint pictures in people’s heads. I think it’s interesting that you say you hope I can find someone better, I heard that a lot whenever I spoke about her. I guess everyone could see how unfair she was to me, but me."
Workinmoms,fba27yr,t3_d6ozui,1576660634.0,"“Written like a straight couple” I personally see nothing wrong with that. Straight couples, gay couples are all the same and we fight very hard every day to make sure we’re all treated equally. I on the other hand am happy that there role in the show was the same as the other couples. Also in season one they did have an intimate scene."
