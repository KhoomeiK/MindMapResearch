news,ffa9amm,t1_ffa6ows,1579730388.0,"The facts likely don’t meet the requirement for actual malice. In a defamation suit, especially against public official, the allegations must be so well-supported as to surpass plausibility.

TumblrInAction,fe2uzq2,t1_fe0c3k9,1578843130.0,"So obviously I don’t agree with him, but here’s my best bet as to what his argument could look like:

Heavily restricting access to anything pornographic to people under 18 will limit their exposure to sexual material to basically what is mainstream and shown to the world. although things are changing, in most of the world the mainstream material is almost exclusively heterosexual/heteronormative. If there’s a kid who is predisposed to be gay but only sees material that is sexually charged in a hetero setting then they will be brainwashed to think that is what is supposed to happen and not see that the way they feel about the same sex is okay and something that should be embraced. 

Add in some woke terms and claims of oppression and it would probably look something like that ^^"

LawSchool,fcvc3x6,t3_ej41wo,1577998986.0,"Start early, prioritize. If making a rigid schedule will help you then do that and stick to it. There will be mishaps and exceptions but if you take an honest look at your workload and portion out your time to get to the readings and assignments you will find there’s a lot of time in there to get a quick workout in. 

If you can’t get schedule in time to get a good workout (you can) pick up a good kettlebell and go to town at home. There’s really nothing you can’t do with an appropriate weight kettlebell and a floor.

Edit: in case you were looking to go an at home route this is a good place to start and get comfortable with. You can branch it to almost anything from here.
