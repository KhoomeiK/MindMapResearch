SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffhcijh,t3_etjzxa,1579929872.0,They never give enough warning for these events! Now its too late for me to panic farm to level up! Do you think my padme team will be able to 7* this survey? What mods do people recommend?
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffbzepe,t1_ffb9ybk,1579787535.0,"Great question. In my store I see a crystal pack of 15710 crystals for the same price as the hyperspace bundle.

I guess 1st place gives about 800 crystals per day over f2p (400 from Arena and 400 from ships). So looks like its about 20 days to break even. And thats just the crystals. As F2p you're gonna be spending ages longer farming. Its pretty nuts! Numbers get worse pretty quickly if you're not 1st place though, so better get in that shard chat."

chess,ff5r1uy,t3_ertbiy,1579606850.0,"I want to say no, but actually it might be possible by taking a checking pawn en passant? Thats the only scenario i can think where you could remove an attacker from one direction and interpose in a different one? Still think its impossible due to the angles involved."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ff576yb,t1_ff4o9tz,1579582213.0,Great question! With the hyperspace bundle now available there shouldn't be any more pesky f2p players below level 85. Just get rid of the level bar!
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ff2r2dp,t1_ff2mkb6,1579520250.0,I mean thats kinda the point. All the f2p's saying you can get by just by focused farming and smart gearing wouldnt get anywhere near their current payoffs if they started again today. All it takes is 5 people in your new shard to have bought hyperspace bundles and to be in a shard chat to effectively lock you out forever from decent crystal income.
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ff2j4lp,t1_ff2eaqz,1579508447.0,"Tbh: After seeing Ahnald its almost crazy not to do that. Spend $100 and get top 20 arena rewards from day 1? $200 for first place from day 1? Or slog through and climb arena as f2p. As f2p starting today you'll never even reach top 20 payout anymore, so forget snowballing. By the time you hit level 85, theyll be reliced. So you'll continually slip further and further behind."

adventofcode,fersz6n,t3_eqgnow,1579358042.0,"Bad news: BFS will almost certainly be too slow. The puzzle is much larger than the examples. As you guessed, the search space grows very quickly.

Good news: DFS is very similar to BFS and should find a solution. It should be quite easy to build a DFS solution based on what you've got with minimal code tweaks.

Bad news: The solution DFS finds may not be optimal.

Good news: There is another algorithm thats very similar to DFS which is guaranteed to find an optimal solution if you can work out a good heuristic. Hope thats not too cryptic! Good luck!"

worldnews,fdu65ja,t1_fdu54e2,1578728252.0,"Acceptable discourse? Perhaps, but in my opinion the main concern is that it deflects the conversation away from the original topic. When you're just shooting the shit its probably fine, in a debate or a serious discussion its a weak argument and should be called out. Not sure where Reddit comments sit on that spectrum."

movies,fdn84zf,t1_fdn4yh8,1578579862.0,"Somehow its lacks some of the charm of Hot Fuzz. I think its mostly to do with Simon Pegg playing against type. But the more I watch it the more I like it. I agree the symmetry is really something though. I think its more layered than the others in the trikogy, and thats saying something!"
chess,fdmn1ea,t1_fdmeg8e,1578556254.0,Interesting idea. Here's another. They play an odd number of games. If the scores are tied at the end the player who was black more often wins. Higher seed gets to choose if they take black or white for game 1.
bloodbowl,fdjxq7h,t1_fdjq5jw,1578490807.0,I think running a game or two to save up for the apo is worth the risk. But maybe thats more for an eternal league? Apos not really necessary for lizards until you start facing mb/claw.
