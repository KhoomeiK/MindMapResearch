People seem to get far too offended about things these days, it’s at the point where everyone is so worried about what others will think they just shut their mouth.  For what? To ensure the other person is not offended, hurt, when they may need to hear these negative things at times! This sensitivity stuff is getting way out of hand."
offmychest,feolmdu,t1_fen9tug,1579301913.0,"I’m in a union, but that doesn’t change the way the hiring is. And if you file a grievance about not getting a job even though you fit all the requirements, chances are it won’t do anything. The reason you still don’t get the position is usually vague and along the lines as “there was a better candidate that better fit the position”. No specifics on why you didn’t get it."
offmychest,feok3w1,t1_feo6gnk,1579301295.0,Really?? That is pathetic. Where do these companies even get off paying $15. A masters education should be worth more than that. That is so sad...
offmychest,feojygz,t1_fenyy5l,1579301213.0,"They also don’t have enough internships to cater to the amounts of graduates. The other issue is many places don’t bother with grades because they want someone with the experience so they can same money on training costs too. I would say knowledge is important if your going to be a doctor, nurse, or lawyer but all other careers you can get with just experience and minimal knowledge."
offmychest,feniatv,t1_fenhigb,1579285292.0,That definitely is! I’m probably going to have to start looking later on though. Currently expecting my first baby and so that’ll tie me up for a bit! But I haven’t really taken a look of hris though so thank you for that idea! :)
offmychest,fene8cb,t1_fen20d5,1579282799.0,"It’s not so bad! I’ve even there 7 years now and I make $30/hr and now I am a lot happier than I have a job that pays well when I see others barely surviving after finishing their degree and are still working and making $17-$20/hour. I just kinda wish my own company gave me a chance to demonstrate my skills and hire me for internal positions pertaining to my HR degree..but then I gave up and realized they still want the damn 3-4 years experience! That being said, my husband and a friend all got HR degrees and not one of us are doing HR lol"
offmychest,femzhhq,t3_eq0mo8,1579273539.0,"I went back to school to finish my degree, got my degree while working 40 hours a week at my job in a call centre. This was 3 years ago...guess where I’m working now? The same call centre and same position...didn’t get an interview at any of the jobs I applied that said “entry level” and I have 15k more student debt. College is a joke, the market is over saturated with college graduates since our parents pushed us to get a degree and now here we are. With our degrees and still not hireable in our field. It’s all about who you know now and who can kiss the most ass. Knowledge is not important"
offmychest,fems55n,t3_eq0bre,1579268051.0,"Thank you for sharing your story. I’m so sorry you’ve been through all this and are still feeling the past everyday. I do think you are in a better and a better environment. Let yourself be happy with your new bf :) just take one day at a time and if you break up, then you have great memories and experiences instead of just shitty ones. Being gay in the Middle East would be very hard and I can only imagine. My cousin is gay and Muslim in Canada and I have a few other friends who are gay and Muslim in Canada and while it was tough, I think a lot of other countries are more open to homosexuality. Have you looked elsewhere in the world? Maybe check out other countries to see if you can apply for work elsewhere as a back up? What are you doing for your studies? Good luck!! And I know it doesn’t mean much but I am proud of you for getting out of the Middle East."
relationship_advice,fehv5ym,t3_ep8vif,1579124500.0,"I bought a town home 5 years ago and moved in with a friend right away. She pays rent...then my bf moved in 3 months later, and we just got married in May of 2019 and are expecting a first child in June 2020. My friend is still with us lol she is thinking of moving, but the economy is so shitty right now she would probably pay more in rent so she’s like meh. We plan to make the baby transition as easy for her as possible (not treating her as a baby sitter or anything). She has her own bathroom as well. She calls us mom and dad and we call her daughter lol we have a nice family dynamic. People make what they can with what they have, you can get married and do what you want; all that means is you have an extra friend to share the fun times with. Oh and I’ll add we bought a dog in 2018 so we really have a nice family dynamic now haha. It works for us. :) marriage is not a lot different if you are already living together either. So go ahead propose and your friend will be thrilled! And your gf :) 

Also, we have said if we move in a few years she can come with us and rent the basement lol"
