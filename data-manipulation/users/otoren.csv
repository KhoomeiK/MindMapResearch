therewasanattempt,fei7dj6,t1_fei690t,1579131927.0,"Most pro-choice people also want as few abortions as possible, because an abortion is typically the last resort used when a woman needs to not have a child when she is already pregnant - whatever her reason may be, including health reasons or financial reasons. The best thing to do would be to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place, and to provide support for women who do get pregnant unintentionally so that they have viable options for their future, and the future of a child they may have.

Actual policies that reduce abortion are good sex education, widely available sexual health care, widely available birth control, prenatal and neo-natal health care and support, widely available and cheap daycare or other childcare options, and the loss of a stigma against sex.

Edit: Also, your premise is that abortion is murder, which is a legal definition and is not correct because it causes a lot of other problems. Giving legal personhood to non-viable fetuses is a very complex issue."

There were quite a few people voted to 0, so probably someone who is a TERF came through the post. Or it could be one of the many anti-women trolls who feel they are not represented well in this sub and downvote everything out of spite, even if it has nothing to do with them. Unfortunately, that happens quite a bit in female-oriented spaces on Reddit.

You know how political views are described more as a horseshoe than a line? I feel like TERFs are the left-wing version of tradwife alt-right women. Both espouse harmful views of women but believe they are celebrating femininity, while not understanding how limited and harming that view of femininity is."
TrollXChromosomes,fcw4b5k,t1_fcvtg82,1578016829.0,"If you were born in the early 80s, you're probably a Millenial, so you'd have to be a Moomer! Actually, I like to refer to the people at the tail end of Gen X before the Millenials really get started as Gen [Y Tho](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/y-tho).

TERFs boil down to this: biologically female persons are the only ones who are women. You will see a lot of focus on the womb/ovaries, and on menstruation, as important parts of what they define as womanhood.

For people who are inclusive, ""woman"" refers to how the person views themselves, i.e., their gender, rather than biological sex. So a person may be AMAB (assigned male at birth, or biologically and chromosomally male), but is still a woman because they know they are one regardless of their physical being. A person who is AFAB (assigned female at birth) but knows they are a man would not be a woman. Or maybe they know they are not a woman OR a man!

To a TERF, both of these people are wrong - so the AMAB is a man, and the AFAB is a woman, regardless of the individual's self-identity. TERFs would be the kind of people who misgender trans people on purpose to reject the trans person's self-identity.

Basically, the enemies of TERFs are anyone who rejects a strict biological binary for an individual's identity. It doesn't matter if you are trans, cis, straight, gay, purple, an elephant - if you believe that individuals have the right to decide their own gender identity, you are the enemy of a TERF.

There is a lot of regressive misogyny in TERF thinking, because of how reductive it is (i.e., people are definable by their reproductive organs, and women in particular by things like menstruation). You may see their positions framed as a celebration of femininity, rather than the exclusionary garbage it frequently is.

I don't off the top of my head know any good resources on intersectional feminism, but TrollX has always been a pretty good and open place for discussion. In a more intellectual sense you may have luck (if you want to look into more in-depth discussions) looking for resources online for inclusive, intersectional feminism, which would be a feminism that celebrates women of all types, not just biological women, and women of all shapes and sizes and colors, not just able-bodied or white women.

It can be difficult at first to figure out the difference between celebration of a group of people, and the exclusion of a different group of people to elevate some onto a higher status. It's like learning to look for coded language, and having the critical thinking tools available to dissect not just the words, but the implication behind words. For instance, a celebration of women as ""menstruators"" is immediately exclusionary, because any woman who can't or doesn't menstruate is not a part of that group. Women with health issues, women above childbearing age, trans women, etc, would all be excluded under that model.

Hope this has been somewhat helpful."

Also, they can't fathom women having sexual agency, so a woman coming into a men's bathroom to harass them isn't something that would even cross their mind. But it probably has crossed their mind to go into a women's bathroom and harass women.

offmychest,fc43q14,t1_fc40g3v,1577405835.0,"I'd say women don't like guys who treat them like they're not just regular people. Most women dislike being talked to as if their sex is the only thing that matters. Like the OP here - a lot of people wouldn't be particularly surprised at a man changing his own oil, and there is no reason for a woman not to be able to do the same physical thing. It's not like you change oil with your penis, after all! (Uh, but if you do, maybe you should stop, that doesn't sound hygienic)

Plus, this is a self-selecting sample of people who have things that bother them. So of course the women who come here are going to be talking about things that have bothered them.

What I'm saying is, you shouldn't be so afraid to make friends of either sex. The most awesome thing would be for you to come out of all this feeling comfortable talking to men or women in a friendly sense! It can be hard with strangers, but just remember to respect a woman's boundaries the same way you would respect a man's."
