What hasn't been mentioned as much is that all the geometry data isn't being stored locally on your computer like in past flight simulators. Instead it's going to be streamed to your PC over the internet from their Azure servers containing over 2 Petabytes of world data from Bing maps.

It'd be much more efficient to just evaporate the water using waste heat from the reactor and then just condense it back into liquid water in a separate tank to get fresh, potable water. Then you're not using electricity in the process and can just tap into the cooling system for the needed heat energy.

I'd especially think they'd avoid electrolysis on saltwater subs since electrolysis of seawater produces chlorine gas. When your that deep underwater with no easy escape, I don't think you'd want to risk gassing your whole crew should a leak occur."

My reasoning is that the ISS isn't free from atmospheric drag. It's enough that they have to occasionally boost their orbit back up or else they'd eventually fall back to Earth's surface.

You just use the waste heat to evaporate seawater and then you can condense it back into a collection tank and have fresh, potable water. It even has the benefit of helping to keep the reactor cool. Modern nuclear powered aircraft carriers even do this on a much larger scale."

People are getting so focused on trying to keep the planet how it is right now instead of realizing it has been in a constant flux since life first took hold here. Sure, we're definitely speeding up the rate of change, but this how evolution and nature works. People are part of nature, not separate from it. Organisms that can't keep up die off and make room for new organisms that can. 

Humans wouldn't be here if that process didn't happen. When life started producing oxygen on the planet at large rates, it killed off the majority of anerobic life and aerobic life took over which eventually lead to us being able to evolve and become the species we are today. That's an extinction event far greater than anything happening right now. If we were present for that massive atmospheric event back then, would we have tried preventing it or let it happen?"

That's basically as much as WWII and was caused by just the Mongols. The majority of Natives American tribes had a large culture of war with each other before European settlers arrived in the Americas so that adds on a lot but hard to get a good estimate due to their lack of written history. The Aztec empire killed a lot of people before they were wiped out by disease. Not even sure what the death count approaches when you factor in all of the different wars different Chinese dynasties had. 

My bet is that modern weapons have a definitely killed far less than older weapons have."

Once someone figures out how to profit more from Green technologies than sticking with fossil fuels, you'll see lots of governments shifting their stance on climate change. And this WILL happen. We're already seeing it happen with coal. It's now cheaper to install solar/wind power than it is to build a new coal power plant of equivalent energy yield. As a result, less and less coal plants are being built and more are starting to shut down.

 If someone can figure out how to sequester carbon from the air and use it in the production of a fuel equivalent to oil and have it still be cheaper than the price of a barrel of crude oil, you'd see governments flip to it practically overnight.

A tiger for example gets stuck in a heatwave, it's dead if it can't escape or find shelter. A human gets stuck in a heatwave, he can build a shelter to provide shade, dig into the ground for natural insulation from the heat, or think of other ways to stay cool in the heat and survive.

They're still getting usable/marketable data off you with what you're doing anyways. Should probably also go try and learn about how those algorithms work and try and implement them in some code. You've got a pretty selfish view that your data carries that much importance for them to track it on an individual basis like that.

They don't sell individual data, it'd be pointless to as you'd barely get any useful Info from that. You need large datasets to get marketable data and if you start putting importance on any individual identifiable info in the data, it starts to introduce bias into your algorithm that decreases the usability of it. 

They instead aggregate your data with other peoples to find trends. The company that buys the data can only tell that someone listened to a song and a bunch of other people also listened to it, they don't know who specifically listened to it though. It becomes a mess of data essentially. Using the insights gained on that large dataset, Spotify can then tune their algorithms to spit back a list of songs similar to a song passed to the algorithm based on what other random people liked that listened to that song."

It's caused by your brain getting confused over what your eyes are seeing and what your inner ear is feeling balance wise. Good news is that for most people, their brains will get used to the disconnect over time and you'll stop feeling the nausea. If you haven't already, try turning on the chaperone settings of your headset that give you reference points of the real world inside the headset, I've seen it help some people."

That's the main problem here because the weather mod relies on it heavily to reduce visibility. His options right now are to reimplement fog in the game to be particle based, disable it when inside but then the fog will be gone when you look out a window which ruins the immersive part of the mod, or keep it always on which is what he's currently doing."
