Rational_skeptic,fc3pavz,t3_efseob,1577395245.0,"Went to visit my ex back home a few years back and his cat was an absolute mess. Howling, balding, clumps of dusty fur where there was any, just looked absolutely miserable. I asked what the fuck was wrong with her and the ex said ""She's in heat and has fleas."" 

(Just for clarity, we both swear like sailors and lovingly hurl insults at each other when one needs a swift kick in the ass)

""Why the fuck haven't you fixed her in the last 10 years?! And do you need me to pay for some Frontline?"" 

""Nah, I heard Frontline is super bad for them, and I don't want to take away a natural part of her physiology."" 

""One, the powder OBVIOUSLY isn't working. Two, who the fuck told you that the most common flea treatment recommended by vets is going to kill your cat? Three, there is absolutely no excuse on this earth to not fix your animals."" 

""I heard this vet say that the chemicals can be bad for them."" 

""YOUR CAT IS NEARLY BALD BECAUSE OF THE SHIT YOU COAT HER WITH EVERY DAY. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON?!"" 

""A couple of years now."" 

&#x200B;

I couldn't talk him into spaying the cat despite all of the studies showing that they live longer, healthier lives. I immediately drove to the nearest pet store to buy Frontline, told him he could suck it the fuck up this once to solve a TWO YEAR OLD PROBLEM and then switch to whatever ""nontoxic"" bullshit he wants for maintenance afterward. Came back a couple of months later to a (mostly) clean coat of fur and a much friendlier cat. Sadly she's so morbidly obese that she can't clean anything below her front armpits, but at least all the fur had grown back. I've been demanding that he take her to a vet about the weight issue but he just says ""I put her on a diet!"" I love that man, but his pet care drives me to absolute rage. 

&#x200B;

1. You can believe your ONE vet who tells you that the treatment EVERY OTHER VET RECOMMENDS is poisonous, and have an absolutely fucking miserable and unhealthy animal, or you can use common sense and ask for a second opinion when the first one isn't doing anything to help. 
2. YOUR ANIMAL WAKES UP FROM SURGERY WITH ONLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WOKE UP WITH SOME PAIN IN A STRANGE PLACE, \*\*NOT\*\* THAT YOU REMOVED A PART OF ITS INTERNAL WORKINGS! Do the right fucking thing and give your pet a few hours of light pain, confusion, and anxiety, and in return you spare them years of desperation to find a mate, get laid, and possibly the discomfort and pain of pregnancy, birth, and having their spawn stolen from them. 
3. If a doctor told you that your child's seizures were a problem and to start treatment A, but months go by and there's no reduction in seizures, what kind of fucking moron wouldn't go back to the doctor and ask if there's a treatment B?! If your vet tells you that your cat is dying from conditions related to obesity and to switch to a low-calorie pet food, but your cat doesn't lose weight, FUCKING ASK YOUR VET FOR A NEW SOLUTION. ""I started feeding her a little less but she's still fat"" THEN FEED HER EVEN FUCKING LESS YOU NEGLIGENT PIECE OF SHIT!
