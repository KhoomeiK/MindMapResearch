Or are you born in another country? Heck if you research about ""la conquista"" you Will see that one of the reasons of Moctecuzoma xocoyotzin doubts was because they tought Cortez was quetzalcoatl. At least the huey tlatoani now about the aztec priesthood are you from the greath houses? Because if not you would be a macehual and you would submit to the huei tlatoani and I asure you the most you have to aspire is a soldier if you where a man, aztec society was really machist, women at most where wives and if you where genderless maybe a canon folder for a sacrifice. But of course doubt of my ancestry, doesnt matter Im learning nahuatl and have been reading, hearing and researchinh aztecs. But aniway if you want to talk about aztecs, im always UP to that oh! And one more thing quetzalcoatl was the god of teotihuacan the mitic City wich mexicas mytified.

Ah and anothir tibit: I wouldt put aztecs that high knowing they where defeated by their own people, more than spaniards, other Kingdoms hated them."

Aniway on the subject, well I believe you can be catholic and say you are genderless but bear in mind that is between God and you, other may judge you and other try to advice you. My advice is love others like you want to be loved, beign a Christian and a catholic boils down to that, for guidance go to a priest, and after you wander your life and return, bear in mind that church welcomes you, or at least this catholic Will be happy for you return."
