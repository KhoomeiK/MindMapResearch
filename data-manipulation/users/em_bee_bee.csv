EnglishLearning,ffqkxj6,t3_euoeis,1580137386.0,"Ok so gotta is just an informal/slang way of saying the two words ""got to"" like ""I gotta go"" = ""I have got to go"" or ""I've got to go""

If you were to say ""I've got an idea"" you would pronounce it as ""got- AN"" not ""gotten""

Gotten is it's own word to use differently. It is a past participle of ""get"" and as such should be used with a helper verb, usually have or has

Example: I am going to get apples. -\> I **have gotten** apples.
