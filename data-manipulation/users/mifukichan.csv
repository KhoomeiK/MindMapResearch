dating_advice,ff1cy05,t3_eqsqcx,1579477575.0,"Yes - I remember once I went through a sexual harrassment issue at work. A man I was hoping would ask me out spotted the issue and reported it to our boss... the problem was solved, but I was left realising that there was no way he'd make a move now after he saw how uncomfortable I was with the other guy's advances, even if they were clearly inappropriate. 
I knew this meant I had to ask him out, so I did. It was the first time Id ever asked out a man, but we're still dating, so Id call it a success!!! You can do it!!"

AmItheAsshole,fc8du8r,t1_fc5sxmh,1577532678.0,Exactly?? When you out someone with conservative parents you literally ruin their life.

This might be a long shot, but a while ago I had this weird glitch where the saved photo would appear at the very bottom of a random folder... it was super annoying and I don't want to send you on some dumb endless mission, but it's what happened to me. If you have the same issue it'll be a weird miracle!"

AmItheAsshole,fc76wce,t1_fc76puu,1577499148.0,"What he did was super shitty obviously, but how are you or OP supposed to know how their specific conservative parents would react? How about this then: op RISKED his brother's life, rather than outright ended it, and we all still don't know if it's safe or not. You dont sound like a gay person to me with how little you have thought about this."
AmItheAsshole,fc76ewt,t1_fc4y8j3,1577498781.0,It is literally the end of the world for ops brother??? Dudes life is ruined?? Do you have any idea how your life is completely fucked when you're outed as gay and have conservative parents?? So many people on this dang thread seem to think it's not a big deal and it hurts my heart.

AmItheAsshole,fc762jp,t3_eg58rc,1577498519.0,"YTA. HOLY SHIT you don't out people, ESPECIALLY when they have conservative parents. Your brother was being a dick, but you absolutely knew what you were doing when you outed him like that, there were so many other ways you could have gone about it. Anyone here who says NTA is really obviously straight and completely ignorant of the problems faced by lgbt people by their own choice. You were the massive asshole, dude."
AmItheAsshole,fc75soy,t1_fc5ldny,1577498309.0,"It's not about sexual orientation giving immunity, it's about ruining someone's life for something way less severe? Yeah bro was a dick, but he's had his life ruined, not just been humiliated. How can't you see this?"
AmItheAsshole,fc75ou4,t1_fc56ulp,1577498225.0,"When it's true and youre trying to figure out how they know and get past the shock of them finding out, it is 100% harder to compose yourself and think of a backup or play it off. Youre also really obviously straight and have no idea what issues gay people go through, or have bothered to try and care. Yah the bro was a dick, but your comment really makes your ignorance shine through and it's an ugly look."

It is wrong, malicious, and a harmful thing to say!
Keep learning and growing. I don't think we on reddit can help too much since we can't meet irl, but you seem kind."
