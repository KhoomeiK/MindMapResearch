Personally, when I see these types of images I just roll my eyes. It seems like she has red hair in the way natural to a white woman. It's not that the picture isn't nice, it's just funny, but not surprising, that in one of the few games with actual representation, people would automatically whitewash the fanfiction. However, after reading what you've written and taking it at face value, I realize it's more complicated than that.

Anyway, I wouldn't have even responded if it had not been for your comment, and to add a word of support. I would have made a mental note of distaste and moved on."

This whole post screams coin tell Pro level confusion. Either that or someone who desperately needs to believe that there is a difference in the way white people in America and white people in Europe view themselves.

It was Europeans who colonized the planet dummy. No amount of jargon, or complexity is going to change that.

I'm not saying that every white person is maliciously and consciously racist, but to argue that wasps are somehow the masterminds behind all racism comes across as some half-baked conspiracy theory.

Edit: just, because whiteness is a religion, doesn't mean that Blackness is a religion too. I would argue that Blackness is a facet of the white religion. I mean, even woke black people are still struggling with some form of internalized anti blackness.
