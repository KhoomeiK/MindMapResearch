And if Apple wanted to capture the USB-C phone market then they will have to have USB-C themselves."

AskReddit,ffhph38,t1_ffhii5l,1579946941.0,"that is if that was surprising/interesting to you. but if you know that it just eventually happens to NPCs that you create, then maybe you don't find it interesting enough to warrant an answer. or maybe you already know what happens when you give them knowledge that you exist and you're more interested in what would happen it they don't know? does a god even think and feel the same way a human would? maybe the difference between a god's mind and a human's is as big as the difference between the mind of a human and a tardigrade?"
AskReddit,ffhp6h8,t1_ffhcqzh,1579946483.0,"if a real god exists, is this god really ""good"", or did it's creations evolve to become relatively good to each other for the sake of survival? i mean even animals seem to be relatively good to each other and does not seem to be trying to destroy each other into extinction. is it a singular god?

Did a bunch of chemicals thru random chance eventually just become ""alive"", then actively or passively tend to reproduce and stay alive that even the ones that seem to have no consciousness, like viruses, do so? And then evolve enough to eventually have consciousness, emotions, intelligence, and enough creativity to create arts and sciences and build objects to enable it to fly out of it's planet? was it all just a very long and very lucky chain of events that made this possible? if it was random, how likely is it to happen? do certain subtances have a natural tendency to go this way eventually? can lifeforms like these exist without containing carbon atoms? why have life at all? is a virus truly ""alive""?

the existence of a god does not make sense to the logical side of my mind. but i guess my mind still has a side that is primitive enough to think a god possibly exists just like how a lot of cultures from all over the world, from the ancient times to the modern, think so. maybe that makes me a moron? is it really the ""primitive"" side of my mind that makes me wonder about the existence of a creator? i'm too high for this."
