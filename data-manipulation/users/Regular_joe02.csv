a country you were never a part of. The People’s Republic of China has never had control over Taiwan. When the PRC overthrew the Republic of China after WW2, all the ROC leaders and loyalists who could fled to Taiwan and set made Taipei their new capital.  Their still officially the Republic of China even.

Since the PRC can’t forcefully submit the ROC without the US stepping in, they choose to pretend like their not independent but it’s like.. get real guys."

KerbalSpaceProgram,fdpo17n,t1_fdlhw4c,1578634232.0,"This reply makes it sound to me like you don’t cut your throttle during launch. If that’s true then yes, even if you angle, if it’s a steepish angle you will go so high that you’ll escape kerbin SOI before your orbit path goes all the way around.  Once you raise your AP to 80 km just cut engines. Burn prograde again at AP to circularize. Some people in here are getting really technical.. it’s not really that technical"
KerbalSpaceProgram,fdpmma9,t1_fdofjo9,1578632933.0,"It also depends on what Thrust to weight ratio OP is launching with.

I build typically to about 1.5 and just launch- turn to 45* at 1000m and 100m/s and stay there till AP of 80km.  (I like wide margins)  typically costs me a frugal 3200 Dv tops.

todayilearned,fdo02ko,t1_fdmiyne,1578596342.0,"Precisely!  There’s a strong dichotomy to a lot of the lessons in the Bible that only become apparent when looked at as a whole. Which can easily be mistaken by well-meaning people on both sides when you only look at one half.

The message of salvation itself is another example. The fact that good deeds don’t get you to heaven and  “only by faith” [in Jesus sacrifice] can man be saved. Yet, “faith without deeds is dead” so we’re left with this confusing notion that yeah.. Man can’t work his way to heaven, but if you believe and live out that belief the way the Bible talks about, good deeds will naturally be a result.

Can I go on a quick tangent ask what your opinion is on the concept of sin?

One things that’s always grind my gears is this idea that it’s a spectrum. It’s a very human thing to do we like to put lots of things on a sliding scale where one is worse than the other but if we look at what the Bible says about it, there’s no little sins and big sins. It’s more akin to... breaking a window. Let’s say you shot a hole in it with a BB gun. Doesn’t matter that’s it’s just a small hole, the window is now broken, and it needs to be replaced. So if you smash it with a baseball bat (murder) or poke a small hole (lying) it makes no difference, the window is broken. 

What do you think?

I feel like if more people viewed it like breaking a window, and less like a spectrum.. we could stop hating each other because “he’s an alcoholic” or “does drugs” or “has a different lifestyle” and just be kind and show love to each other like we’re supposed to. Nothing kills a sense of moral superiority like realizing your little white lies make you no better than the drug dealer down the street."
todayilearned,fdnt5mf,t1_fdn5com,1578592319.0,Right? I did not expect such a positive response from this. Thank you
KerbalSpaceProgram,fdmhlvk,t1_fdh2hd4,1578550190.0,I really like your design athletics. Very cool! Miss my early KSP days just trying out new things.

However, as my literary teacher used to say, whenever you see a therefore, you have to ask “what’s the therefore there for” (corny I know)

Anyways, if we look back to the section preceding this one, we see that they are talking about not making things of a materialistic nature the focus of your life, but rather, focus on the spiritual. Verse 24 (paraphrasing) No one can serve two masters. You will love one, and despise the other.... you cannot serve both God and money.

So what it’s really saying is: don’t spend all your time being concerned about material things, which are temporary, but pursue a life focused on God and he will make sure your material needs are met.

So while at first, the verses you referenced, when viewed alone, might appear in a way to be referencing getting handed things for nothing, it would be a bit of a misinterpretation to apply that meaning to it.

Anywhere the Bible does actually speak on the subject of work, it very much does say to give everything your 100% best.

Col 3:23  “whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you are working for the Lord”

And specifically References providing for your household as a part of a faith-centered life in 1st Timothy 5:8 “anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for the own household has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.”

We also know that work was part of Gods plan for a perfect world, as even in the garden of eden, the Bible’s picture of life in paradise, it was Adam and Eves job to tend to the garden and provide for themselves.

 So, yeah. Sorry if that got a little lengthy, Just thought your choice of argument was very interesting and it piqued my interest. Cheers!

EDIT: a word"
kerbalspaceprogram_2,fdhl4vx,t3_elcyma,1578424961.0,"Ooh! Playing off your idea, and making it a multiplayer thing.

You could create a contract to “Rescue X Kermin from Y planet” and again, post a reward of some sort. Once you accepted the game would just load in the relevant kerbal/equipment like it does in the current game solo missions. This would be so exciting! People could design their whole KSC around a blunderbirds style organization.

Come to think of it this contract mechanic isn’t the most plausible thing I’ve heard so far in regards to how exactly they could do a multiplayer. Really gonna have to try to not get my hopes up!

Devs plz :)

AskReddit,fckgnyl,t1_fcjonyp,1577724913.0,"I can only speak for Afghanistan, but theres no winning when the locals literally don’t care to maintain their own liberty. National sentiment is just not something that’s in their culture. They don’t care. They grow their poppies and they don’t give a shit who comes in and says they’re in charge.

When I was in Afghanistan in 2014 as soon as we’d pull out of a location, or turn over an outpost to the ANA (afghan national army) they’d turn around and make a deal with the Taliban to look the other way as long as the taliban left them alone.

Yes there were some that I met which really believed their country could be something great.. but the majority just don’t care no matter how easy we try to make it for them. So we’re either their, or we’re not. No one else is ever going to take up the torch.

science,fc07izz,t1_fc05ek2,1577281870.0,"I’m not necessarily agreeing with beanz.. but there’s some shit out there that needs more explanation. The stones of a great pyramid are massive in their own right, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons. Seems massive but conceptually explainable that leverage and pulley tricks could get that moved.

Now take the foundation stones of the Heliopolis. 1,650 tons. There’s really no way. Now I’m not taking it to the conclusions u/ahoomanbeanz is, but I am admitting that something else is going on here.

The Romans themselves, meticulous record keepers, don’t even claim that they put them there. Later scientists just looked at the Heliopolis on top of it and gave them credit for the whole site. Now stones that large. Again, 1,650 tons, some of the largest single blocks found anywhere, ever. Would have been such an achievement the romans would have certainly documented how they came to be there. But there’s nothing.

It’s a fascinating subject to look into. Someone, maybe not aliens, maybe not “gods of old” but someone with more technology then the ancient civilizations we currently know of, were here before us. That much is pretty clear."
