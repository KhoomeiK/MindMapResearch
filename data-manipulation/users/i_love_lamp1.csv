borderlands3,ff3abma,t1_ff39laa,1579537313.0,"> You sound surprised that there can still be good items that are hard to obtain while the game is balanced.

Not a great writer unfortunately so that is probably my downfall. 

Moreso disappointed that BL3 doesn't feel like they are hitting the mark for items/builds to be both diverse and powerful.  GB preached that diversity was a big deal and when I try to make a different build the items specific to it usually are a massive pain to get. Hence my complaint of items seeming to be treated differently. 

They are making headway if they continue to go the same way as they are. Class Mods need to be revised in the wake of the DLC."
borderlands3,ff398c3,t1_ff1hktb,1579536673.0,"Title doesn't mention anything about ""everything is equal"". Please read the title before blurting a response.

Balance to me is about usability. After all that is what GB was after from the get go. For items to be usable and viable under niche builds.  The problem to me is it feels like GB is pulling an ""Animal Farm.""

borderlands3,ff0b3sc,t1_ff0arnr,1579467081.0,That still doesn't make sense. If all items are equally viable or balanced. Why would some items have comparably lower drops rates from dedicated loot sources than others?

MonsterHunterWorld,fdwzt7t,t1_fdww621,1578763856.0,Yes. It's very noticeable. I'm not too sure on the numbers but for solo hunts it's probably your choice on which to use but I think ATT UP is the better option since it's just a good general use buff.

musicians just hit the keys they mean to hit.  Or potentially are getting at how musicians will recognize chord progression from just hearing and know what to do next rather than having to slow down and think about what comes next.  Or are referring to reading sheet music and not having to think too hard on the notes to play, timing, etc and just play it.

I doubt they are saying musicians just go brain dead as soon as they start playing an instrument.  I'm not nearly as experienced as you are musically, so I may be wrong.  I have a hard time thinking someone actually believes a musician isn't thinking while playing."

borderlands3,fddh0u1,t1_fddghtz,1578311904.0,That too.  I would like to see named enemies be able to drop only dedicated drops and all world drops are from non-named regular mob enemies.  It would help breathe new life into mobbing I think and also satisfy specific item farming.
borderlands3,fddga5v,t1_fddfzab,1578310967.0,"For the most part, I've given up on farming rare spawns.  Dedicated drops in general are disappointing and have lost their charm that made farming in BL fun."
borderlands3,fddfsp2,t1_fdd6q2u,1578310333.0,"Or drop their dedicated drops 100% of the time, keep the spawn rare but not the drop.  Remove one RNG so it remains at a 10% ""drop chance""."
MonsterHunterWorld,fcy6j9l,t1_fcy26ig,1578075500.0,"It will proc faster initially but the monster will gain resistance to procs throughout the fight, leaving you with a massive amount of status threshold to build up to.  It might activate an extra proc in a fight. I usually get 2 poisons on a Safi run with SnS without anything extra for it.  


Also, the status weakness will have an effect on monsters.  The higher the stars, the longer the proc lasts and Sofa Jesus is super weak to poison so it lasts a long time.  The longer the status lasts, the less time you have to build to the proc threshold since monsters can't be affected by a status and gain threshold damage  to them at the same time.  Only one or the other.  


In my opinion, in terms of DPS status, such as poison vs blast.  They both are fantastic and probably very good for the average player.  However, if you're a sloppy player (like myself), poison is better since you don't have to be constantly doing damage to the monster since the poison damaging the monster for you.  I like poison on support builds so I can contribute to DPS while I'm breaking from attacking to buff/heal/etc. If you are great at sticking on a monster to give constant pressure, blast is better, since the you build up to the threshold and then it procs instantly and then you keep building up to it.  Same rules apply as mentioned above.
