dogs,ffgigr4,t3_et8uk8,1579906981.0,"1. exercise and occupy the puppy! bored, over-energized puppy = puppy never giving big dog a break.
2. this is normal. the puppy has to learn to accept ""no"". as long as your dog isn't aggressive towards the puppy, a little nip or growl may be how the big dog teaches little dog to take social cues. it's very natural. it's not dangerous unless your dog will take things too far. if you aren't sure about how your dog will handle this, you may need to separate them a bit and socialize the puppy around ***other*** ***dogs*** until he learns to stop when another dog says stop. basically he has to learn from somedog. if your dog's not ok teaching him without really getting aggressive, another dog needs to do that teaching."
reactivedogs,ffb2hjg,t3_eslj5n,1579750133.0,"first, do ***not*** allow the child and dog to get that close to one another for the time being. period. yes, it's incredibly hard. i had to first create save spaces the cats could go throughout my place and then move to completely separating 2 dogs from 2 cats. all in a 1 bdrm apartment. all just me, myself and i tending to all of them. all 4 being exceptionally needy creatures. it was hell, lol. but you can't risk the safety of anyone. so take the steps to separate the child from the dog. at no time should the child be standing, walking or running in a space the dog can access.

once that's done, we can talk training each being. i cannot emphasize this enough. most child dog bites are 100% preventable. they occur because adults either can't read the situation enough to see all the warning signs before a bite happens, or doesn't take the steps to unequivocally prevent the dog from having opportunity to bite the child once they do notice something is wrong. this can build up over days, weeks, months or even years before the dog feels he has no option because his plethora of warnings are being ignored. so that's your absolute top priority!!!

now that the kiddo's safe and the dog doesn't feel threatened, we can work on training the child how to interact with dogs - this isn't an ""every chance i get"" kind of thing, though. this is a controlled interaction. that's the big thing here - controlled. not just correcting or reinforcing behavior when the dog and kid interact out of your control and you happen to be able to teach in that moment. a child's interaction with a reactive dog at this stage should ***never*** be random. you control ***when*** they interact, ***so that you can control*** ***HOW*** ***they interact.***

one thing i noticed is you said the main spot this negative interaction happens is in the playroom, but that she's now forbidden from there and it happens elsewhere. were there ever dog toys in the playroom? does the dog play with the child's toys? does the child play with the dog's toys? are the dog toys left around the room anywhere in the house? this could literally be as simple as the dog resource guarding her toys or toys she wishes were hers.

did the dog have a bed in the playroom? is the dog usually laying down before these interactions take place, regardless of location? the dog may simply feel her personal space is being invaded. as cute as all the pictures we see of the toddler napping on top the dog are, this is not even close to reality for most dogs. just like us, dogs have their personal space bubble. and just as you might become annoyed at someone repeatedly violating your personal space without permission, so do most dogs. the dog needs to ""invite"" the child into her space before the child is allowed to enter it. that can only be done right now by complete separation as it's not just your kiddo but also *you* who don't know what this particular dog's personal bubble is.

how does the child react when the dog approaches and growls? (ignore, scream, hit dog, babble at dog, look dog in eye, etc?)

you mention you ""make sure \[your\] son does not go after the dogs"", but remember dogs don't think like we do. observation during intentional interaction between child and dogs is key to figuring out what is making your pup feel that your child ***is*** going after her or her space or her things. some dogs will just leave everyone else alone unless they're willfully ""attacked"". other dogs have a much more particular definition of what constitutes a violation of their sovereignty, haha!

hang in there! and please, separate them pronto and then work on the rest of it. the answers should never stop at separation. separation is simply a non-negotiable emergency fix. but it's hardly a solution! 

this is quite long, so i'll wrap up. but once you have a safe and complete handle on the coexistence of the small beings, if you answer some of the above queries, i might be able to be of some use lol.

you got this!!"
dogs,feerfs3,t3_eodqb5,1579039617.0,i'm so sorry for your loss.
Dogtraining,fe622ri,t3_enqk8y,1578880043.0,"well my initial thought is he's confused. you said he was doing find when going outside? was he using pipi pads at all during that time or 100% either going outside or the occasional accident inside? if he wasn't using pads at all during that time, the thing is, he was being trained not to pee inside. so then he has no idea what you want from him now.

the other things is pipi pads often have pheromones added that signal dogs to go there. he may have some sort of issue with the particular pads. trying a different brand might help, though i'm not sure how much variation there is in the pheromones each company uses. seems like something that would be pretty universal.

another thing, are the pads scented? maybe he dislikes something about the smell. again, could try a different brand or get unscented pipi pads.

what process do you use when you take him to the pads? the fact that he's laying down and whimpering makes me wonder if it is indeed utter confusion as to what he's supposed to do with those pads and why you won't take him outside where he knows is the place he's supposed to pee. however, dogs don't usually just walk up to a spot and pee per se. they wander around first until they find the perfect spot (pipi pad should be such in this case) and then pee. if you're ""\[taking\] him to a pipi pad"", that process is arrested. do you make him stay at the pad until he goes?

hopefully something there sounds applicable. if you want to provide more info tho i might be able to be a bit more helpful :).

dogs,fdotxnt,t1_fdm50w4,1578612796.0,"the other type of bad rescue organizations are the financially dishonest ones. any hint of secrecy or restriction on who can know what or be involved in what within the organization is a red flag. for example, if the foster families aren't allowed to take their own foster pets to the vet but instead one person or a small group of people are the only ones allowed to take them in. there's always exceptions, and even that could be nothing shady. if, however, most of the animals that they go to the public to contribute to medical care for have poor outcomes from their medical care, one must wonder if they're actually getting that care at all. same goes if the person(s) responsible for financial matters gets offended at requests to see receipts, chronically makes odd excuses for why they can't product the receipts (my foster dog ate the receipt only flies so many times, haha!) or simply habitually ignores requests to produce such documentation. but, again, keep in mind that there's nothing with a bigger tendency to mislead than appearances. so if you're concerned, do your homework, talk to someone else in the organization who's not involved with anything financial and isn't bff's with the person in charge of finances. 

as long as medical care is actually being provided, i'd take a financially ""loose"" rescue over a hoarding one any day. but in the end, any manner of financial shadiness is extremely damaging to the cause and is ultimately stealing not just from contributors but from the animals who should be benefiting from those dollars that manage to find their way into a fund besides the animal care one.

sadly so long as there are entities that need help, dishonest people will use that for their own gain, be it as a means to hoard animals or fill their own bank account disingenuously. in the end, though, the best thing we can do is volunteer ourselves with honor, and, if we find ourselves offering our services to a less than honest operation, take it to the appropriate authorities to investigate far more thoroughly and accurately than your or i could.

i absolutely get not wanting to be a part of a corrupt rescue. but never forget that even if you find yourself smack in the middle of something bad, so long as you've been doing good with your two hands, the animals you came in contact with will still be better off for your having been there and your conscience will be clear. in some cases, the best thing we can do, in fact, is to infiltrate bad organizations with good. i'm not saying you're going to find yourself with a bad rescue, of course, but simply that as long as you're doing what is good yourself, that's... , well, good! :)"
Dogtraining,fdngu04,t3_em197x,1578585509.0,"ugh, i hate it when people throw food on the ground! my older girl has chronic pancreatitis, and eating much of what most people in the US call food will make her extremely ill and could be fatal. my younger girl inhales things she finds on the ground giving me no time to take them away. we're still working on consistency with ""drop it"" with her, and my older will ignore me depending on her current RATtitude lol. it's not only rude and littering to throw human food on the ground, it can be deadly to our pets and wildlife in general.

anyhow, yeah, seeing we can't stop people from doing that, le sigh....

are you walking him down a busy street or more residential roads? on residential roads that aren't super busy, you could super carefully walk him down the middle of the road :-/. basically keep him far enough away from the sides of the road that he can't reach the litter. it's a sucky solution, though. but it's temporary....

start teaching him ""leave it"" and ""drop it"" at home, as those will ultimately be what you use to prevent ingestion of roadside trash. take your time teaching it before using the commands on walks. the goal being 100% obedience to those commands. googling how to teach either of those should produce good reward-based guides. use more and more prized treats the better he gets until he'll obey instantly, without consideration of exactly how delicious the contraband is when the command is given. once you're ready to take the commands on the road, bring the highest value treats you can carry (i mean pieces of chicken might not be practical to carry on walks, haha), and when you give the commands immediately produce his reward to encourage and reinforce that leaving or dropping the contraband gets him a prized morsel and lavish praise from you.

be patient and just go for avoidance of the roadside food litter in the meantime. you don't want him confused or frustrated or worried about these commands. it's easy to want desperately for the pup to be ready for the next step a bit too quickly. if you find he's wavering on immediate obedience with a specific training treat, always remember it's ok to take a step back. that treat might just be a little too enticing for him at that point. go back to a little less-liked treat as the one he has to leave or drop and practice more before moving to the more prized one again. ultimately, if these commands are taught patiently and thoroughly, you won't really have to worry so much about what he comes upon on walks as you'll have verbal control over what he does with his finds."

reactivedogs,fcyghkd,t1_fcxezy6,1578079707.0,">There’s plenty of context in the OP, and most of the top comments acknowledge that it may be possible with the right resources to rehab this dog. If you have specific shelter or rescue resources that the OP should look into, by all means recommend them.

yes, there is plenty of context:

1) the dog has never actually injured or tried to injure anyone. twice he was scared, to the point of feeling the need to defend himself, by humans who had no clue how to interact with or read a fearful dog. one of those times, we don't even know if the dog actually intended to touch the hand at all. once he was scared, to the point of feeling the need to defend himself, by a human who either reacted without thinking or had no clue how to interact with any dog, ever, fearful or not. three for three, this ""dangerous"" dog willfully inhibited his bite, choosing ***to not harm the person***.

2) humans have repeatedly and for 5 years failed this dog. he was not given the training required to live within the expectations of human society. he was not given the socialization required to live within the expectations of human society. and do not attack those people, either, they are wonderful humans who saved an abused liter of puppies. did the best they could with what they had and what they knew. they are personally unable to provide for the dog. that's precisely what rehoming exists for.

people doing ignorant things and/or ignoring this dog's repeated, escalating warnings is not a valid reason to kill a dog. humans failing to provide training and socialization is not a valid reason to kill a dog. a scared dog actively choosing not to do harm to the humans who pushed him to the point of feeling the need to defend himself is not a valid reason to kill a dog.  


>People don’t take euthanasia lightly here. Do you think a bunch of people all decided this morning “gee, I think I’ll go on the internet and tell someone to kill their dog today”?

I think ignorant, scared people, who are misguidedly convinced that they need to tell someone to kill their dog in order to protect society, are sincerely doing what they think is right. They have invoked logical fallacies and allowed emotion to cloud clear thinking. Unfortunately, a passionate inhumanity is still inhumanity. And a blinded good intention can make a person incredibly illogical and dangerous. Those who would ask no questions, recommend no second opinions and afford the dog no chance of being taken in by a shelter or rescue, are dangerous and should not own dogs or have any say in the lives of dogs. This does not mean they are evil people. Good people can in fact lose their way.

However noble their intentions, many persons have allowed themselves to believe that they are qualified to read a post on reddit and become judge, jury, expert witness, financial advisor, determiner of availability of affordable experts in the OPs area, and, finally, executioner. It is horrifying the number of assumptions and assertions that have been tossed about with hubris instead of evidence in order to justify killing this dog.

True. And killing is also the only way to ensure that an animal without a bite history will never bite (again). 

That type of thinking is sadly what leads to the mass of people wanting the OP to just kill the dog. A dog biting means the human or dog pushed that dog beyond his breaking point. And that's all it means. If you want an animal that has no breaking point, adopt a unicorn, lol. There is no such thing as a ""safe"" dog. Yes, there are characteristics in every dog that suggest whether he is more or less prone to biting. A human doing something foolish or ignoring warning signs and getting bit for it simply means they found the buttons to push to get that dog to try to take control of a situation that scared him. And that means using teeth when his warnings are ignored. These bites were ""inhibited bites"". As in the dog didn't want to chow down. The conflation of anything related in any way with the word ""bite"" regardless of everything defining what bite means in that instance and a dog attacking people is incredible. A dog who has actually ***attacked*** someone who isn't attacking him/those he's supposed to protect, is a serious issue. A ""bite history"" is, in and of itself, not. The context of those bites changes everything. I wish people would settle down enough to actually read and think before just dismissing everything else said as soon as they see the word ""bite"".

yes, some dogs are truly a danger and rehoming is unwise unless they can be rehomed to a very specific environment that is designed for truly aggressive dogs. those dogs, however, are pretty darned rare. in this case, there's no way to label your boy as a rehoming danger without a behaviorist determining he has underlying animosity towards other living creatures. the only bite that wasn't clearly human caused was the treat bite, and a little more info would probably reveal that was not a malicious event.

i'd be far more interested in whether he's been attacked by other dogs, whether he's been harmed or seriously scared, intentionally or accidentally by an adult or child, whether he had any socialization during the crucial 8-14 weeks old period and, if so, what that socialization looked like, etc.

while i commend you for rescuing him and his siblings, it doesn't sound like you or your friends who took the other puppies necessarily have the knowledge to work with rescue dogs. it doesn't matter that they were 5 weeks old, they still experienced trauma. they were ripped from their mother and left alone, defenseless and starving in a box. so, yeah, they're doing to be reactive. no puppy who went through that would ***not*** be reactive. it's awesome that you saved them, don't get me wrong!! but it's also not at all surprising that they have all had ""behavioral issues"". unfortunately, most of those issues could have been corrected or greatly mitigated during puppyhood, but when they aren't, you end up with reactive adult dogs. all that means is they're afraid!! they aren't malicious, they're scared!

most traumatized adult dogs can be greatly helped with their fears. it's easier during puppyhood, and lack of proper socialization during puppyhood in itself can create a reactive dog without that puppy having been abandoned and left to die. combining their trauma and lack of knowledge in how to work with them as traumatized puppies, and maybe lack of knowledge that most dogs will ***not*** be too thrilled with other dogs and strange humans if they aren't properly socialized and when to do it, you get exactly what you're describing. all these siblings can be helped, not just your boy.

if we accept the mentality that scared dogs should be killed as suggested by others..... just no.

now if your dog ***is*** assessed by a ***licensed behaviorist*** and determined to be more than just a scared dog who never got the training and support he needed after being left to die in a box, then, yes, be there for the euthanasia to comfort your dog. but a dog should not be sentenced to death because evil humans left him to die and then uneducated humans didn't know how to handle a traumatized dog. none of this is his fault. there's a big difference between a truly aggressive dog and a dog who is petrified and trying to defend himself with the only weapon he has at his disposal - his teeth. how exactly do we think dogs should protect themselves when they're scared? the most painfully blatant example of this is when your friend got bitten. seriously, what did she think was going to happen when she come up besides a scared dog and grabs him?? he's going to whip around and bite. that's how dogs are!!! was he even aware she was there before she grabbed him? did he know and trust her? how would you like to be standing petrified trying to fend off something you thought was a threat and then have a creature towering 3 feet above you grab you from behind?

your dog needs someone who understands dogs and understands traumatized dogs. you did an amazing thing saving him and his siblings! but you've done as much for him as you can and know how to do! you've done your best to love him! not everyone is equipped to rehabilitate traumatized dogs. and now you've had to move, you've got a traumatized dog in a small space with his fears surrounding him. that's not your fault. you've done your best. and i'm not pointing fingers at you. i hope you realize that! but my point is also that it's not ***his*** fault. and he shouldn't be killed simply because he didn't receive the support and training he needed. if it's gotten to the point that he's crossed over from scared dog to trying to bite you because you look at him wrong, then fine, euthanasia is likely the best outcome for him. but that's not what you're describing, and it's sickening that people are trying to get you to kill him without getting him assessed by a professional. 

there ***are*** no kill shelters and rescues. it's flat out false to say that ""If you give a dog like this to a shelter or rescue, they will euth the dog...."". Whether that happens is based on what entity you give him to and whether they have a conscience enough to assess the dog and not just kill him because it's freaking easier. and that's precisely why it happens when""If you give a dog like this to a shelter or rescue, they will euth the dog...."". it's not because that particular dog is determined to be a true danger to every living thing, it's because *they don't want to spend the time or money or effort into finding an adopter who knows how to handle a reactive dog.* Simple as that. dogs with ""problems"" take longer to get adopted and sit in shelters longer taking up a kennel. that kennel could be used for a dog who will be easy to adopt out. so they kill the one dog to make space for another they can get rid of quicker. i get that the insane need for space in kennels puts people in a hard position and it makes some sort of logical sense to free up the space for other dogs in need of rescue who will get adopted quickly. but being in the way is really not a humane or decent reason to kill a dog. nor is being stressed. again, there's stressed and there's stressed. if a dog is in such bad shape that he's miserable 24/7, then ***maybe*** putting him down is the kind thing to do. then again, ***maybe*** prozac is the kind thing to do. that's a hard argument to make when 90% of this country lives on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds. what, since it's a dog and not a human with exactly the same problem - stress due to anxiety - we decide for it that it would be better off dead?? that's a hard sell and a dangerous path to go down as a society. and then, there's stress. regular old specific things scare a dog and stress him out and guess what? he's happy as a clam the other 95% of the time. but we should kill him because 5% of the time he's stressed so it's kind to end his life?? again, way jacked up. what makes that even more disgusting is that ***most reactive dogs can be worked with and become massively less stressed.*** but we should still kill him because, what, there's too many dogs and a dog without ""problems"" doesn't take time and resources?"

Dogtraining,fc9p86b,t3_egs38r,1577556085.0,"Do ***NOT*** get angry!!!! This will make her aggression 100x worse!

First, figure out why she's biting. Is she angry or does she just not realize she's hurting you? What you can do when she bites is yelp like a hurt puppy. Those pain-yelps when puppies play to rough are what teaches the offending pup that they need to be more gentle.

If she's ""angry"", you gotta figure out why. Does she actually have a short temper, or is she fearful? Fear is very often the culprit. Was she recently attacked/""attacked"" by another dog? Or even unintentionally scared good by another dog. Did a human scare her because they thought it was ""funny"", or unintentionally scare or hurt her? A child grabbing a tail or hitting is common. Did someone yell at her and freak her out?

If you can't find a very good reason for her likely fear, a vet visit is important. Dogs get grumpy when they don't feel well. She could be in pain, sick, not sleeping well, etc. A vet should check her for medical reasons for her being on edge.

If medical reasons and any hint of dog or human ""aggression"" towards her can be ruled out, she may simply not be amused by whatever's going on at the time she bites. Since this isn't only when you reach for her (which can be scary for a little dog!), but apparently just running up to your mom out of nowhere and biting, start paying very close attention to her mood and watching what's happening right before she becomes aggressive. It's quite possible your mom's doing something that scares her despite it having nothing whatsoever to do with her. It's also possible there's some environmental coincidence. Was there loud music on at the time? Did someone yell across the house to someone else? Was pup hungry, tired, under-exercised at the time? Just like humans, a dog doesn't always respond appropriately to things he doesn't like. A hungry dog may become a hangry dog who gets pissed if it looks like the cat is having fun. The cat might be clear across the room, but if pup is tired and wants to sleep and the cat is rolling around on the floor batting at things, dog could become simply annoyed and lash out at the cat, another dog or a human. That kind of thing.

Once she's medically cleared, if you don't know precisely what's triggering her and why, getting her assessed by a dog behaviorist or force-free trainer would be highly advisable. The sooner you figure out what's going on and use force-free training to reinforce handling her emotions in a positive, calm manner instead of an aggressive one, the more likely this can be completely reversed. Waiting will not only result in potential harm to her bitees, but will allow her to practice improperly using her mouth to handle her emotions.

Good luck!! Breathe! You'll get through this :)."
Dogtraining,fc9my71,t3_egskp4,1577555099.0,"Fear: Did a dog chase her or get angry or aggressive with her? I don't mean necessarily attack, but simply scare her good.

Example: Do you have any other dogs who bark at dogs or people? Or say Grandma has a dog she's around who barks?

Breed: Research the breed(s) she is. Certain breeds don't tend to do well around or accept other dogs and/or unknown people. Unknown includes that boy. Simply seeing him, even saying hi to or getting pets from, someone isn't enough for her to consider him on of ""her people"".

Socialization: The critical window for socialization is 8-14 weeks (some say 4-14 weeks). If she was not properly and thoroughly socialized with all manner of other dogs and people during this window, you may simply be seeing the natural progressing of that missing training. The good news is she's still young! It won't be nearly as easy to socialize not that she's well past the time where dogs are most capable of learning and accepting concepts foreign to their natural instincts. But your chances of success are much greater at 8 months than later. Get her into training/socialization classes yesterday.

Over-excitement: Dogs bark when they get so excited about something that they don't know what to do with themselves. This is often seen when a dog's human gets home. They jump on and bark at their human. This time, it's not out of fear, anxiety, wanting the person to go away or not knowing/trusting the person. They're simply super stoked to see you. It's like a child squealing in excitement, or you ""dancing"", fist-pumping, making an enthused utterance, etc. Physical manifestation of super-happy. In this case, it's a matter of teaching a young, excitable puppy how to self-regulate that excitement and self-calm. Classes could be helpful. If you choose to do at home, not giving her attention until she's calm in any and all situations where she gets crazy excited can be helpful. Don't be angry at her, just don't return her excitement and don't giver her the attention she wants until she's taken a breath and stopped bouncing/barking.

Under-Exercise: She's a pup, and while i'm not sure what breed mix she is off hand, I'd bet she needs a ***lot*** of exercise. **Most** dogs are severely under exercised. A bored dog will find ways to entertain himself. A dog with excess energy and no outlet for it will find ways to expend that energy, or simply become hyper because the lack of exercise is driving her crazy. Try some running, fetch, chase, long walks at least a couple hours a day and see if she calms right down. Remember, do not react to her barking in the meantime.

*Do not react:* Completely ignore her barking. Don't look out the window to see what she's barking at, look at her or even look up or turn your head from what you're occupied with. Literally act like absolutely nothing happened. If your ears are cracking, hold your breath for a few seconds - randomize the time! - and wander off to another room without looking at or speaking to her. Don't come back the second she stops barking. The goal is to show her she gets no reward for barking - your attention or interest - and you really could not be less interested about another dog or human outside/approaching. On the other side, so ***not*** scold, yell at or in any way make a thing of it. Negative attention can be worse than positive attention for barking. You responding positively - any response that isn't yelling at or rebuking her - is rewarding: ""oh, hey, barking gets me attention! cool!"". You responding negatively - ""shut up!"", ""oh crap, another dog...."" either scares her - fear of your anger and/or anxiety because she doesn't know what she did ""wrong"" - and/or causes her anxiety precisely because you're anxious. If you seem concerned when a dog approaches or you see one outside or you see the boy/another person, he has no idea that it's her impending bark-storm that's making you anxious. All she knows is you get anxious when you see dog or human. If her human is made anxious by these things, surely there's something truly wrong.

Since you're training her to be an ESA, I would highly recommend you get her with a force-free trainer immediately. As you already know, service animals simply can't be reactive. She needs extensive training and exposure to all kinds of people and animals in all kinds of situations in order to be a safe ESA. The cost and time is an investment in a safe, long-term support animal. :)

This is ***FAR*** from expert advice. I have no credentials. My knowledge, insofar as it is accurate, is simply gathered in the process of parenting my own dogs. In many, if not most, cases, while the general knowledge and wisdom is useful, every dog is different. Without knowing you, your girl, your home, your personality, her personality, etc., etc., any advice/ideas are completely generic and may not apply to your girl at all. A behaviorist or force-free trainer could provide better advice for your specific situation."
Dogtraining,fc6r70n,t3_egcqgf,1577487406.0,"My first thought was exactly as someone earlier's: try taking her together. Fear or over-excitement (say if he's always the one who plays ball with her outside, so she has no time for that boring poo business when he steps outside with her) are the ""obvious"" things.

But there's another critical line of thought: how long does he give her to do her business when he takes her out vs when you take her out? How long does she generally take before she goes when you take her out? When you take her out, do you go back inside right after she goes (pee or poo)? When he takes her out, do they go back inside right after she pees on trips outside where peeing is all she's expected to do? Do you both take her to the same area? Does he only take her at one time of day and you at another because of something like work schedules?

If you care to give a shot at answering the above, I might be able to throw out some more ideas in case it's not the typical fear/excitement thing."
Dogtraining,fbvzb7o,t1_fbf7doa,1577138270.0,"Just be careful what breed (mix) you adopt when you're ready for a second furball. it's really hard to know the true personality of a dog who's at a shelter or who's been in foster care for only a short time. So if there's any clues as to the breed(s), research that breed of dog before you adopt to make sure you don't adopt one who does best as an only-dog. Having two who resource guard - especially if the new dog resource guards you - which can happen with rescues - is challenging... to say the least. And be sure to look at many websites that claim to inform readers of the typical temperament of a breed. I've found a massive amount of inconsistency; even diametrically opposed info on some characteristic. The ""most popular"" assessments have been far more accurate so far for my mixed-breed girls."
