ChronicPain,ffja4i9,t1_ffj7tmr,1579993989.0,Thanks. Appreciate the info.
ChronicPain,ffj2yhn,t1_ffiq9ag,1579989067.0,"Yeah I get extremely paranoid on it  and start crying and wanting to die. Too many racing thoughts and desires to escape that. Too sensitive.

Indica doesn’t work either. What they claimed was “indica” on the label didn’t work like it supposedly should. Made me paranoid too. 
Only gave me “restless” sleep if you feel me. I sleep but its not restful. I wake up like the nap didnt happen. I think it doesn’t allow the “deep sleep” phase to happen like in normal sleep or something like that 

Also I used to be really addicted to weed until paranoia got too bad. I’m afraid to be a slave to it again. Withdrawals had me so messed up. I couldn’t think of anything but weed, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, felt sick, was irritable and it all lasted a whole month. So I only smoke when desperate due to stomach upset from food on occasions unrelated to chronic pain. But no pain relief. I tried edible indica about 2 hours ago though too. My boyfriend bought some. It has me paranoid right now lol. I’m hiding in the bathroom cuz my cats are also needy and I can’t focus on them. I’m just cracking so bad right now."
ChronicPain,ffj2a57,t1_ffiulvy,1579988589.0,I’ll try some. Thanks
ChronicPain,ffj26oq,t1_ffiubib,1579988521.0,I think because I “abused” weed in my therapist’s opinion and had bad withdrawals on klonopin  they think I’m drug addict. I never abused pills but they assume I did. So stupid. I doubt I’ll ever experience a good pain pill. But who knows. Maybe there is hope and an open minded doctor can help
ChronicPain,ffj20zw,t1_ffiimgg,1579988408.0,"Gonna try some meditation rn. See if it works.

Yeah gawd i hate myself for losing control.
It makes me want to hurt myself for breaking things in the kitchen and screaming so much I’m shocked the neighbors didn’t call the police. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I fantasize about hanging myself. If I can’t keep it together I’m thinking of going to the mental hospital. I don’t want to snap again. But first I’m gonna go to a wAlk In appt tomorrow and beg for a referal to pain management or something. I can’t keep not sleeping."
ChronicPain,ffj1n1h,t1_ffiizkm,1579988127.0,Wow. Sorry to hear that.
ChronicPain,ffj1c31,t1_ffj128a,1579987908.0,Thanks. I Appreciate the comment.
ChronicPain,ffizp72,t1_ffij0bd,1579986718.0,"Yeah I feel like I’m someone else. Definitely extreme changes in personality.

Tried the pillow thing.
And I bought an expensive and well reviewed mattress too from Satva. It’s good to my back but useless for my hips. for me I have to just stretch and rub all day then jump into bed immediately and lay as still as a statue. If I so much as “micro tense” up my leg or butt (which  seems to tense for literally any small movement of my body) I will start to ache again. It’s so weird. Sometimes it works for a few hours or the throb comes right back and I hop out of bed and stretch and massage myself for half the night.


I’ll look into the other stuff you mentioned.
Thanks for all the info."
ChronicPain,ffizdcl,t1_ffir8db,1579986477.0,I’ll look into pain management. I didn’t know I could do that. I thought one had to be dying or something for that. I also hope my doctor will say yes. I have to get approval and referrals from her. I can’t just go. I miss PPO. I’m on Empire Blue cross blue shield (medicaid management plan.)
ChronicPain,ffiyr5f,t1_ffil2ae,1579986027.0,I’ll look into all this. Thanks.
ChronicPain,ffiypzt,t1_ffij3k0,1579986005.0,They kinda work but not really. I either sleep too much on them (like 16 hours) or I toss and turn. And they make me feel tired and “hung over” and irritable when I wake up. The sleepy feeling doesn’t go away and I struggle to be active.

Helpful a little. I also have a therapist. I notice you do too. That’s a good step to take."
politics,feva4i3,t1_fec576j,1579394987.0,There is a video on youtube from Sanders years and yrs ago saying he believes women can be president. This was actually more like decades ago. She is desperate and full of shit.
therewasanattempt,fet18c3,t3_eqfa24,1579370886.0,But the guy also doesn’t speak for all Mexicans. He’s just one Mexican. I’m Mexican and I’m offended. There’s more to us than this played out fucking image. We’re people not caricatures.

nextfuckinglevel,fek19l1,t1_fedtoou,1579190453.0,"I personally felt Into The Wild was a cautionary tale. It was only romantic until he ends up stuck and starving etc etc. I didn’t walk away thinking
 “I wanna do that!” I don’t see how the book or movie was romantic in a sense it would inspire anyone to make his choices or ones similar. But if it has inspired people I wonder wtf part about him dying made them want to go do what he did. The book and movie show what happens when u go unprepared thinking it’s some adventure that one can handle with limited knowledge and preparation."
trashy,fejhnfg,t1_fej0c16,1579174675.0,"I don’t think they look like shit and thus it makes them attractive. I don’t see the “ugly” part at all. I just think they just are hot period. I always find conventionally handsome men to be the ugly ones. I don’t like thick big jaws that look disproportionate, gross muscular bodies, and “bedroom eyes”. They also come off like  fuckboys. And I think muscles look like tumors. And muscle ridden legs look like women’s legs and I guess because it gives them a plump look or something. Lastly big asses on a guy is gross to me too. I feel it should only be on a woman. I like skinny guys with “weird” faces but I guess for me I don’t see them as “ugly attractive” or weird. Just attractive period. I can never see the unattractive part. So whenever anyone is like “eww” or “he’s ugly but hot” I’m like “but where is he ugly?” 

Lol. Idk but that’s me"

Ok ok I jest. But also fuck her."
lastimages,fehzt2m,t1_fdeo989,1579127211.0,Literally no underlying causes? What did the autopsy reveal? Sorry I mean I believe it but isn’t there a cause for everything? And I’m also sorry to hear. My condolences.
lastimages,fehyq91,t1_fehllyh,1579126563.0,Any clue why she did it?
lastimages,fehxpp5,t1_fehgsgn,1579125957.0,Do u have a source for this info? I want to read more about those statistics.
television,fehw5nm,t1_fdi31ql,1579125061.0,All the things you said “the documentary should be about” is exactly what it is about. Watch it.
