PoliticalDiscussion,ff7z5gd,t1_ff7yscm,1579661844.0,"Executive privilege has to be invoked by the president. No other person could say that’s covered. By the way that had its limits and is not an end all be all. It doesn’t cover criminal activities. 

Another note is any subpoena denied after the house officially started their impeachment is a crime. That doesn’t need to be decided by a court. The house has full powers to investigate and hold the executive branch accountable for their actions."
PoliticalDiscussion,ff7yfvh,t1_ff7x0s1,1579661345.0,"They have the power to issue subpoenas to provide oversight of the executive branch. Congress is a check on the executive branch.

But neither of that matters, the government shouldnt have the right to take money from a law abiding citizen. He wasnt breaking any laws at all. That is a violation of the bill of rights."

worldnews,feamfn0,t1_fea94ec,1578950276.0,"So another article came out Trump gave a kill order for the dude 7 months ago. So the question is why would he wait to kill him now? 

Trump even came out and admitted that he did this to shore up support from the GOP in the senate. 

This is a just a distraction from the impeachment."
instantkarma,fe9voc8,t1_fe948mm,1578941816.0,This could have given the dude a heart attack.
worldnews,fe9v36c,t1_fe9rl3q,1578941739.0,The point is yes. The dude did need to die. He was a bad guy. The reason no one had gone after him was the blowback. So the timing for trump to launch this killing is completely suspicious.

He believe what a cop told his friend. He believed the cop was telling the truth. You don’t know what else was going on in the guys life. You are making a great deal of assumptions, just because he killed himself doesn’t make him a piece of shit.

They need to be demilitarized as well. They are there to serve and protect. Not fuck people’s lives over on their petty little whims in a position of power. 

If they don’t want to be held to a higher standard. They can go find a new job. 

I want to see cops actually go to jail for violating the laws and I want to see them pay out the ass. The person not the taxpayers. When police departments get sued. The money should come from the cops pension. Or force them to all have to carry insurance always. 

I’m sick of cops getting away with shit that they should be in jail for."
