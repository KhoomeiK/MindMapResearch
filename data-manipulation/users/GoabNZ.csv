prolife,ffejp6z,t1_ffeh3ye,1579850823.0,"I agree that I am anti-abortion technically. The issue with having prolife (or in this headline's case, the March for Life) relabelled comes from two reasons. 

First, the reason I'm pro-life isn't because I'm anti-abortion, its because I support life and that means I'm generally against abortion. I do support abortion when the mother's life is in threat so its not like I'm anti-every-single-abortion. But rather, I'm pro-as-much-life-as-possible-over-convenience. Saying that I'm anti-abortion is putting the cart before the horse. I'm not pro-life because I'm anti-abortion, I'm anti-abortion because I'm pro-life. 

Secondly is image. Even though I believe pro-life to be the morally correct choice, pro-life is the best word to describe to be palatable to opposing viewpoints. Being ""anti"" implies negativity, especially to a side that views abortion as a good, or at least necessary, thing. Framing pro-lifers as anti-abortion can send a mixed signal to prochoicers. Rather than disagreeing, because we promote life and that means abortion is restricted, it instead sends the signal that we only want to take what they view as a good thing. That our only concern is taking abortion away, and not the reality of promoting life. Being solely anti-abortion implies that we don't care about the child, just as long as its born, which is a narrative some prochoicers do hold. When we do in fact support welfare and do adopt, and we are concerned with any medical or genetic condition present."

It depends what you mean by egg. If you are referring to eggs you buy at the supermarket for consumption, no they are not chickens because they are intentionally not fertilised. I'm of the knowledge you can buy fertilised chicken eggs but they are unethical and banned in many places, but they would be chickens. Baby chickens, yes, but chickens nonetheless.

Because I'm countering this narrative that women have absolutely no responsibility whatsoever. A narrative that is twisting reality to try and make abortion more palatable if women aren't seen as responsible for the sex they had. Yes, men are responsible for for providing sperm - but women are responsible for opening her legs, there is no way around this reality.

Consider this possibility - if the man doesn't know that sex causes pregnancy, but the woman does, then she could object and assuming no rape, she doesn't get pregnant.

Now consider the alternative - if the woman doesn't know about sex and pregnancy, and the man does, he may ask about pregnancy, or he may make assumptions that her silence means she is okay with the risk.

If the man is ignorant, as long as the woman isn't, no unplanned pregnancy would occur. If the woman is ignorant, then unplanned pregnancies may occur."
Abortiondebate,ffe9490,t1_ffe86ss,1579840097.0,"I never said I was for a rape exception though. All I was saying was that in consensual sex, both parties are equally responsible if a pregnancy occurs. Thats what this particular thread boils down to. The only way rape enters the conversation is not about creating a rape exception, but acknowledging the instance where one party doesn't get a choice. 

Of course I give a shit about rape. But I also care about human beings in their earliest stages of development. I am allowed to care about two things simultaneously."
Abortiondebate,ffe8c9s,t1_ffe7tb8,1579839460.0,"Well I'm actually blaming both technically. The ultimate point being that women aren't getting pregnant against their will, they also played a part and are equally liable, so ignorance isn't an excuse (unless, I suppose, if the woman genuinely didn't know about sex and pregnancy).

But no, pulling out isn't recommended because it isn't reliable, from the the aspect of sperm being present before climax, to men being able to pull out in time. Its got nothing to do with disease."

If I ""put"" it in her, it's because she let me. And if it gets her pregnant, it's because her body released an egg. So if that egg gets fertilised, it's also her responsibility.

Abortiondebate,ff416gv,t1_ff3m8lj,1579553300.0,"But there does have to be a line. Otherwise murder is legal. You can say 24 weeks, but I'm pointing out that it is an arbitrary date. It's your opinion to choose there, of course, but it's not based in an objective reality that 23 weeks and under is fine but over is murder, other than that you've declared it to be. If birth was the line, then it'd be acceptable to abort a 35 week fetus but not a premature 25 week one, which is not objective at all, it flies in the face of any personhood argument, as though something like birth fundamentally changes what a person is.

 Likewise, I can say that conception is the line and you could argue anything from sentience to pain to viability to personhood, but those are also arbitrary (not to mention variable as our knowledge advances) as to whether abortion is murder or not. That is what I'm trying to say. There is no scientific way to establish at what date is acceptable, only how broad or narrow murder is defined. You can say it doesn't have to be objective, but then you can't fault prolifers for arguing that conception is the cut off."

They are NZ owned, are well known for their customer service among banks, and have giveaways each month where so many hundred dollars in an account will count as an entry. The only downside is they don't have as many branches so its better if you do majority of banking online."
