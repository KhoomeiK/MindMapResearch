BPD,ffe1tbg,t3_et2s8a,1579834486.0,"Recently kept something from my therapist that ate me alive for over a month because I thought she'd judge me, and when I finally decided to ""come clean"", she really helped me through it."
BPD,ff812tf,t3_es4b8r,1579663222.0,"Don't know if this is exactly what you mean, but I work things out on my own in the car as if someone else is responding. I'll full-on envision another person giving me reactions so I can continue my story or continue problem solving..."
BPD,ff2zu0u,t1_ff2yifo,1579529826.0,"The cops were sent to my place of work, so he gave them my address and came to see me. As a friend who was concerned.

I assume they'll want to meet with me tomorrow, and I feel so sick to my stomach. I know I want to establish this boundary, though. I feel if I'm doing my job and doing it well, there is no reason to provide weekly updates or have them ask me about my mental health. If they feel I'm slacking or whatnot and ask me, I guess that's a different story...

Ugh. I'm bad at this boundary thing."
BPD,ff2zn66,t1_ff2xlu9,1579529665.0,"I assume they'll want to have an informal meeting tomorrow, so I'll plan on telling them I'm uncomfortable with them having this information + will no longer provide weekly updates."
BPD,ff29ane,t1_ff293b8,1579497608.0,Why?
BPD,fewlt4y,t1_fewkrf9,1579413953.0,"I'm the same way! I posted a while back about how I can think logically but cannot accept it, and this is exactly that. I know in my heart that, if another person I know loves me, like a best friend, said that, I would have some no reaction. It's because this is someone who I'm somewhat into..."
BPD,fewkdex,t1_feweh69,1579412554.0,"Experiencing this right now. Someone said ""cool, talk tomorrow"", and even though this is a completely normal way to end a conversation (or so I've been told), it's killing me. Normally they'd say ""sounds good, talk tomorrow"". I mean... wow. How are we supposed to cope and NOT fall into the rabbit hole of believing they now want nothing to do with me and are planning to end our relationship?"
BPD,fe4pwiw,t1_fe4o0e0,1578861716.0,"The most relatable comment for sure. Judging by my post history, I'm sure I'll start isolating soon enough!"
BPD,fe2r2b1,t1_fe2qp1p,1578841947.0,"Honestly, simply knowing I'm not alone in these feelings helps! It's interesting to bring up object permanence and it relating to our inability to believe relationships can be maintained without seeing someone every other day, I'm going to look into this!"
bipolar,fdz6iai,t3_end50v,1578787148.0,I find myself being affected by what happens in my dreams and using dreams to motivate my actions in everyday life..
BPD,fdrv7k0,t1_fdruc2u,1578690301.0,"I really want to attend. And I've known most of them for three/four years now... I know they're not the best communicators, and I also know they live much closer to one another."
BPD,fdrq2ts,t1_fdrm644,1578688041.0,Okay. I feel so weird and unwelcome going into the situation now.
bipolar,fcznpml,t1_fczmdns,1578105228.0,"unfortunately I am planning on drinking tonight, but with close friends... I just can't stop... fuck"
bipolar,fczjcz0,t3_ejodcs,1578102518.0,"new to my bipolar diagnosis... did not know how harmful drinking is (until drinking too much on, admittedly, several occasions and making horrible decisions and then spiraling the next day...)"
BPD,fcx8g6g,t1_fcx76e7,1578055361.0,"Good point. I'll confront it within myself, but definitely do not want to share with others haha..."
BPD,fcx70qz,t1_fcx6tnw,1578053832.0,"I also had a dream I was diagnosed with cancer... so it's really just dreams, but I always make more out of them than they truly are, if that makes sense."
BPD,fcx6ygm,t1_fcx6tnw,1578053762.0,"It could be an ""anxiety dream"" as you say... I've felt guilty about something for a little while, and I had a dream where something I had done came to light, not even with people I love, a stranger... I just felt so horrible when I woke up."

crazyexgirlfriend,fcsv9ul,t3_eipmvb,1577925995.0,I did as well! I hope we both are able to move past it + take the lessons learned.
BPD,fcsr8vw,t1_fcsr0bw,1577923081.0,"I once searched our previous texts to see if they had ever used ""ok"" before instead of the full word... We are one in the same with this mindset. It sucks."
BPD,fcsqquf,t1_fcsqgjo,1577922724.0,"I have this thing where, if I cannot see their face, I fail to feel we are on good terms. I don't know if that makes sense, but I'm a very in-person person haha."
BPD,fcspi1t,t1_fcsm260,1577921831.0,I will try my best!
BPD,fcrgfah,t3_eik06q,1577901489.0,"PHP is an option to consider. I understand where you are mentally, and my program helped me greatly. It prevented me from ending up in inpatient, or worse. Do you have the means to enter a PHP?"
BPD,fcn5x2u,t1_fcn0y8g,1577804115.0,"Truly all you can do. Trying is incredibly difficult, and you got this."
BPD,fcmzymn,t1_fcmvvkg,1577799157.0,Thanks for the advice. I hope you can move forward with your pain and into the New Year with a solid mindset!
BPD,fcmvgtq,t1_fcmrurm,1577794156.0,"I've been dealing with a specific situation as of late, and it seems like I've chosen the right decision, and then, ten seconds after I've made it... I go down a rabbit hole and believe it's the wrong one.

I don't know if we can ever know what the ""right"" and ""wrong"" decisions are..."
BPD,fci6hus,t3_eh7phi,1577658317.0,Please wait here with us for a while. We would love to chat. Share our stories. Hear yours.
bipolar,fbz6did,t3_ef0dcd,1577236475.0,"When I'm at work or out with friends, I am putting up a facade. I am actively trying to be enthused, to react appropriately, and to engage myself in conversation because I feel like I have a reputation to uphold.

When I'm alone or one-on-one with someone, I'm myself, and it's a scary difference."
