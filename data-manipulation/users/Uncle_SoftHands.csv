For those who aren't aware, WorldMax primarily makes parts and supplies them to other companies. One notable snare made from their parts is the Pork Pie BoB. However, they do have a line of their own snares and they sound beautiful. It may not be seamless, but as far as my ears can tell, it's 90% of a Black Beauty for around 30% of the price."

But I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. I think there are a few reasons why you'd be lacking in power or control with heel toe. Lack of strength or technique, lack of ankle mobility (most people these days have that problem, myself included, to fix, just scoot back a bit), or poor pedal setup for the technique. It doesn't have quite the same potential for power of the slide technique, but there's no lack of power if you're doing things correctly. I find I have more control with heel toe than sliding, and the movement is just more energy efficient overall.

Not that the slide technique is bad, it's great as well."
drums,femh4yo,t3_epttw0,1579255258.0,"I find that setting up your pedal well is really important for heel toe playing. Give yourself more beater length first of all. And spring tension is really important. Too little and it's easier to do but lacks power. Too much and it's near impossible to even pull off. It could be helpful to lower your spring tension just until you get the muscle memory developed, then raise it back up to work on the strength.

Also, consider that if you spend a lot of time sitting, your ankles probably aren't that flexible. It can be really helpful to scoot the throne back an inch or two in that case"
