40kLore,fejdwp1,t1_fei9agg,1579169292.0,"Let's say unarmed vs plate instead since mail isn't really lighter.

In both of those scenarios the lighter fighter is completely screwed. The advantage you have of not having the weight of the armor is minor. If anything the increased vision is probably the biggest advantage. But the guy in plate kills you in one blow potentially while he is more or less impervious if both are fighting with a sword.

In a fist fight, there is a reason why there are different weight classes. A heavier opponent stomps a lighter one typically. Speed is only a factor because of the cube law but it doesn't mean actual speed. In fact bigger=faster in terms of actual speed, just like you are faster than an ant but the ant can take way more steps per minute than you. Basically the reason the heavier fighter will attack slower is because of his longer range which is just an advantage. The only advantage to the light weight is that moving the entire body out of the way is easier and fighting takes less energy."

factorio,feg9fm5,t3_eowln4,1579083433.0,"I have a minor pattern that saves a lot of trouble with mining ore. I begin by placing an electric miner so that the edge of its mining area touches the let's say the left most of the ore field's X axis, and the upper part touches the upmost part of the field on any of the 5 Y axis the miner can mine from. Note that sometimes that miner only uses up maybe half its mining area. Next you place the next miner straight downwards so that the upper edge of its mining area is one tile away from the first miner, which means that both mining areas border against each other. Then you continue this pattern until there is no more ore further downwards. Then you place the next row of miners in the same way but so that the left most edge of their mining areas are 1 tile away from the first row. Often the second row will start slightly higher due to the shape of the mine field. 

Continue until there are no more mineable ore.
Now all of the minerals will be mined, connecting the miners with belts is easy and the field lasts a long time with no other adjustments needed except deleting some miners that will run out.

Points of note

1. Most fields have a thick patch in the middle that gives much more ore. Here you can place miners closer together on the y axis for increased production.

2. Often times you can compress the miners a bit like above to make sure that the bottom miner doesn't mine only a few tiles.

3. Some of the outer miners will only have a small ore patch to mine from, maybe 2000 instead of 100 000. I usually build them but disregard them from my calculations, but you can skip them altogether also."
