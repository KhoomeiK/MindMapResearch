It was far more equal.  Equal doesn't mean good, it means equal.  

You can look at the emergence of the Chinese middle class as a disaster, 500 million people trying to live like Americans and drive cars everywhere.  If the peasants have enough to eat I really don't see much advantage to the idea that now they can buy cars and televisions, that will never be sustainable for the entire Chinese population, and it's only possible because 2/3 of the country are second class citizens who aren't allowed to leave their rural prefecture.  It's grossly unequal, and what came before was in fact more equal even if the average standard of living has increased.
