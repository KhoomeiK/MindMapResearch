She had it for like 20 years. She kept it in the corner of the room where it got no sunlight, never trimmed it, barely watered it- it looked fresh out of a nursery. 

When I got it, I tried so hard to take good care of it and it immediately died on me...

A year ago or so I got a little orange cactus that I constantly neglect (hmm, did I water it this month?) and the thing is thriving.

I got my first fitness tracker from them maybe 10 years ago when they were still relatively new company. 

I always liked how you could check your stats online or on their app for free. 

Also, at one point I had a fitbit zip that went haywire for no reason, and I contacted customer service about it. I wasn't sure what they would do since I had it for over a year (at least), and they sent me a new one for free! Didn't even pay shipping. 

So I currently have the Versa, and while it hasn't been perfect, I still love the shit out of it. You can download a flashlight app on it, and it's fairly bright but not blinding which is perfect for 2 am trips to the bathroom."

They may say no, and you can offer a raincheck. Still, either way it'll mean a lot to them to know that someone cares."
