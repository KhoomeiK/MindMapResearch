woof_irl,ffra8g4,t1_ffqrjl4,1580153831.0,"The blunting isn’t (only) from the abrasiveness or that kind of coating. It can occur from any toys, and usually isn’t a problem."
woof_irl,ffra4lm,t1_ffqjq4n,1580153765.0,If the dog plays with balls or other toys a lot this can happen. It is often called “blunting” and it is usually not a problem. Vets say the joy and training they get from the toys is usually worth it.

vegancirclejerk,febrw4k,t1_feb03bz,1578961950.0,"Oh, I see what you mean now, *they* cropped out the credit and the caption from someone else’s twitter, then posted on IG. Gotcha. That really sucks then on both/all counts and kinda makes it all that much worse."
vegancirclejerk,feagx3k,t1_fead3w9,1578948606.0,"The screenshot is posted on Twitter by a vegan account (I posted it and it was shared quite a bit, maybe others did too), but I don’t know about if the Instagram folks did too - only follow them on IG. 

Just looked them up on Twitter, environmental focus/bio, don’t see this tweet (they’re not active on that one though, only 57 tweets and under 100 followers)."
DanceTutorials,feabz26,t3_eo1idd,1578946809.0,"Little “happy feet” in there near the end, along with shuffle and other. If you want some cool shuffle moves, look into electro swing (nu swing, etc) too."
vegancirclejerk,feaa580,t1_fe8tdmf,1578946175.0,"This is instagram, and nothing vegan in the caption. And while the people behind the account could be vegan there is nothing on their bio etc indicating they are vegan. Based on the posts and bio I wouldn’t consider it a vegan IG account. If the Twitter is the same people and vegan, that would be cool :)"
vegancirclejerk,fea9t1t,t1_fe69eg2,1578946059.0,"Oh and this isn’t twitter, it’s instagram."
vegancirclejerk,fea9krl,t1_fe4u50l,1578945979.0,"If the account owners are, they have been hiding it pretty well. It’s predominantly an environmental account (posting wise and bio). I followed a long time ago thinking it was at least vegan friendly but with stuff like this I’m not sure anymore. 

Considering the comments - and if they are vegan - an odd tactic if so."
vegancirclejerk,fea93mf,t1_fe69eg2,1578945820.0,"Yes, that’s what I thought and why I was following it, but it only mentions environment in most posts and all bio etc. EVen is they are vegan it’s not very evident and why omit them from this entire post. 

Pretty surprising omission either way (it is not mentioned in caption either), and a ton of comments on both sides of the fence within."
intj,fdk6vb3,t3_eloe6x,1578497430.0,For many it can be a confidence issue. It can come and go - including for those where it’s out of character too - based on current life circumstance.
facepalm,fdh129t,t1_fdgplbe,1578413064.0,Less emissions than using livestock.
antinatalism,fdasfr6,t3_ek0kge,1578249509.0,"Yeah. Been reading about climate change (“global warming” “greenhouse effect”) since the 80s. Train wreck for over a decade since that’s when I researched this all when we were getting to “that age”. Wow maybe 15 years ago now. 

But yeah 9 months was when things hit the fan. Right. 

Zero sympathy. None. You parents just want to pretend you are in the clear for making a really really bad decision you child will be forced to live with."

vegancirclejerk,fd2t4tv,t1_fcyuzfw,1578151368.0,Just some Instagram influencer idiot - had no idea who she was until people started sharing some screenshot of her quote that she claimed she was “vegan except salmon except special occasions”. The first thing on google when I searched to see who she was — this lovely article though (which doesn’t give her any traffic and was mildly entertaining if you like train wreck stories - https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html)
vegancirclejerk,fcytbfv,t3_ejcma3,1578086628.0,"Learning from the recent Caroline Calloway “version” of vegan, it seems. Such a great source too... a scammer who also bought her followers. 

And we get called militant “gatekeepers” for simply adhering to an official definition. I wonder why we do this, Caroline."

DebateAVegan,fcm5ac2,t1_fclecsc,1577764600.0,"The regenerative vegan community is the smallest it seems. I would recommend finding/joining the Facebook group if you’re on the platform - might be some Australians in it, or someone to point you in the right direction . 

At any rate there are some really interesting conversations that include a vast and diverse range of skills. It’s obviously a vegan run group, but not everyone there is vegan so you do get to learn about many sides of whatever is being discussed."
