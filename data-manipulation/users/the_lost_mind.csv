MaladaptiveDreaming,fex5ggk,t3_eqqqzz,1579424750.0,"Hey I have this too. Its starts off good then before you know it, you somehow managed to hurt your own feelings. The way I get round them is that as soon as I start to feel bad about myself I force myself to return back to reality. On the one hand tho, sometimes the negative ones can be good for working out how you feel and stuff, kind of like dreams,  but on the other hand they make you feel crap. I could give the ideal advise and say analyse them - do you know why they are there - but tbh I don’t want to face that so I just shut them off. Yeah, maybe don’t do what I’m doing ha ha"

ForeverAlone,fcgvouq,t3_eh38hw,1577644391.0,"I have the same problem. A guy I was sort of close with for lots of years used to be shy and friendly and now is overconfident, brags, and it annoys me how much he’s changed and he doesn’t even realise it. However, I believe that underneath people never change. I think people are good at covering up their past, but can never truly let go. I think cutting him off is all you can do, why surround yourself with people who can only hurt you?"
