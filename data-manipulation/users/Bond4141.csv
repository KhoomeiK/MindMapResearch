76% or so black Americans come from a single parent household. Compared to iirc 26% non-hispanic whites. That means 76% of black males lack proper father figures, and will likely latch onto whatever they can relate to. On top of that there's easy access to women with no emotional connection via apps like Tinder. Resulting in a lot of relationships that won't pan out. 

The lack of a proper male role model will make the women unable to find a properly matured male to settle down with. And the men will likely be overly masculine and aggressive. They don't know how to properly act. This will cause more single parent households in the future as well.

Add onto that, that being a single mother brings in more welfare money than being in a relationship and you have a spiraling culture going down the drain.

If welfare was removed, or at the very least changing it in order to financially encourage relationships would go a long way.
