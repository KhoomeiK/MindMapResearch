AskReddit,ff6zwsb,t1_ff6nh3u,1579638327.0,"That sounds pretty awful honestly. I've considered defense work since its usually a more stable salary with other perks but learning how to bill and track hours is not something I care to do. The job is stressful enough without worrying about reports and billable hours on top. I also like representing the ""little guy"" more but I certainly don't begrudge someone doing defense work. Our job is to represent our client's interest even if the client sucks sometimes or even if the case is crap. There are plenty of garbage cases against insurance companies too but I have talked to a lot of defense attorneys who know a plaintiff's case is good and worth more but the adjuster refuses to pay without going through a circus and filing what are often frivolous (in my opinion) SD motions, going to mediation without intending to pay, etc. I'd imagine that would be frustrating at times. Plaintiff's tend to be much more reasonable when it comes to listening to their attorney's advice regarding case value, settlements, etc.

No real point to this comment, I just rarely talk to defense attorneys outside of them being opposing counsel and none of my IRL friends are lawyers, so it's interesting to hear about."

Overwatch,ff3wk5k,t1_ff3toci,1579550410.0,I think there should be more flexibility or at least some champs that can play multiple roles like soldier dps/healer or dva tank/dps or moira dps/healer. Just throwing out ideas but it would at least give more options.
Overwatch,ff3vqe3,t1_ff36uj6,1579549897.0,"Perhaps having certain characters be flex picks could help. Instead of 2-2-2 it could be 1-2-1 with 2 flex picks. Every team needs a healer and a tank but does every team need 2 of each? Some characters like Soldier, symmetra, and mei could be DPS/support. Or Dva could be tank/dps.

I don't know what champions specifically it could be or how many flex there should be(I actually haven't played OW in a bit). I play Smite, a MOBA and it is pretty much locked into solo, mid, jungle, adc, and support. Support and solo are usually tanks, mid usually a mage, adc usually hunter (ranged dps), and jungler is usually an assassin. However, there is a lot of wiggle room there as long as the team comp as a whole makes sense. 

The risk is that given more options people would queue support and just pick a dps or something. This does happen but not very often in ranked. In OW, having certain champs as flex could help or *gasp* rely on people to actually play the role they choose. Just some thoughts"

Fantasy,fdt7isp,t1_fdocx7j,1578712939.0,"I think the ""best woman author"" lists may have the opposite effect. By separating them out you inadvertently are placing them in a lesser category. If they were actually as good, then they'd appear in the overall top lists. That is why people think diversity reads might not be as good. If your company had to hire 20% minorities then many people would doubt any minority hired was the best person for the job. The same shit happened when I went to college. People would assume the black kids only got in due to affirmative action.

It's all bullshit but it's often subconscious and unavoidable. I honestly think these lists of top female authors or top diversity books often have the complete opposite effect."
Fantasy,fdt5ysf,t1_fdprigy,1578712354.0,"If you recommend a book because the author is a woman or black then I'd assume the book is not as good as books recommended based off the content of the book. It'd be like telling me to buy a book because the author is poor and needs the money.

This is often subconscious and I never realized it until this discussion. But saying ""here are the best woman authors"" is putting them in a lesser category and may have the opposite effect than intended. I'd rather the worst NBA player than the best WNBA player on my team. But books are different. There are no inherent disadvantages in writing. If the books by women really are as good, then why even separate them?"
AskReddit,fds4fgn,t3_emuqkb,1578694119.0,"Fashionable pants for females with pockets or possibly shirts with an inside pocket to hold your cell phone, car keys, and wallet.

I wear a suit for work and the breast pockets in the jacket are amazing. If I could design pants or a shirt to include such convenient features it would change the industry. The trick is to avoid the bulging or discomfort."
AskReddit,fdrowj6,t1_fdqirt5,1578687583.0,"About thirty years ago my mom bought a fisher price wagon. I think it was meant either to sit in while mom pulls. My mom still uses the damn thing thirty years later for yard work, moving mulch, etc. That thing is unbreakable."
Fantasy,fdrfcsz,t1_fdrcb13,1578683686.0,"I don't know how far into it you got, but in my opinion it gets better. Minilan starts off unlikeable but now he has a wife, kids, and is more a mentor figure than cocky asshole wizard. Recently the story has focused on other characters such as his apprentices. I also like how the story goes into great detail exploring the economic effects of magic and politics. And the magic system is quite interesting.

Then again, I am easy to please."
Fantasy,fdqxxae,t3_emtody,1578676438.0,"While the wizards in Spellmonger can certainly fight at range, the combat wizards use a 'spellblade' (basically a sword that can cast spells like a wand) and use magic to boost their speed and reflexes. They often engage is melee combat."
AskReddit,fdg4925,t1_fdfb8w9,1578379419.0,"I think cops are being trained not to ask that. If they do I always say no ""I'm not sure officer."" Even if you're pretty sure you know why you were pulled over there is no way to actually know why the cop pulled you over, so you are not lying. I find the, ""Do you know how fast you were going"" to be much trickier."
AskReddit,fdg3hrg,t1_fdeq4qj,1578378618.0,"Similar story. ""You running late? I clocked you at 15 over."" ""I am now...""

He laughed, gave me a warning, and I did end up being 10 minutes late."
AskReddit,fdg1pia,t1_fdf7kqt,1578376789.0,"I don't think that is true and it likely varies by jurisdiction. Maybe as a pedestrian, but I'm pretty sure if you are driving you have to show ID.

Regardless, it is terrible advice to deny giving your license/registration/insurance when you are pulled over."
AskReddit,fdg0lxv,t1_fdf0hf7,1578375713.0,"You are 100% correct. Even hiring a lawyer won't get you off without additional evidence such as another eyewitness, video, etc. The judge always believes the cops over the defendant. An attorney will more likely strike a deal with the prosecutor to lower the charge before going in front of the judge - something many people don't even realize you can do before the hearing."
