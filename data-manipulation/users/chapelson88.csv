Parenting,ffpckiw,t3_eugwof,1580091663.0,People criticize you if you work and they criticize you if you stay at home. You can’t win so don’t try. You and your husband made the right decision for your family.
todayilearned,ffpcfuk,t3_eugxi5,1580091573.0,Well that was lucky.
Parenting,ffpcdj0,t3_eugyp2,1580091527.0,You shouldn’t feel shame. You should feel grateful your daughter trusted you and told you. Don’t do something to break that trust.

ArmchairExpert,ffjr0tm,t1_ffbe52q,1580004700.0,I think a parent could be horrible. I think a single person could be horrible. That makes that factor cancel itself out.
ArmchairExpert,ffjpygk,t3_eu0aec,1580003997.0,Dax interrupting someone.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffjpqe6,t3_eu0cdk,1580003852.0,None of us love her. *

AMillionLittleThings,ffh2erg,t3_etkf6g,1579921276.0,Of course that isn’t a wig. That’s supposed to be her hair growing back.

Parenting,fffejnf,t3_etcai5,1579882232.0,You’re pregnant and that trumps his stuff. Tell him to go to bed earlier if he needs more sleep. I know it’s easier said than done but I’m pregnant right now and am annoyed on your behalf.
UnresolvedMysteries,fffecsv,t1_fff7xqc,1579882113.0,Nooooo not sweet Fred Savage. Ugh everyone is ruined.
Parenting,ffdkh2w,t3_et1hpe,1579822787.0,"You’re in the hard part. It’ll get easier. Baby carriers help. Strollers you can insert the car seat into help. Not needing to feed and change your baby every hour will help the most, so some of it just takes time."
