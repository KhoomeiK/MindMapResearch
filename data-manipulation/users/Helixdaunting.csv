I'm sure there are white nationalists giving each other a thumbs up as well, does that mean we should stop doing it?

>as a covert way to own the libs

How exactly does using the OK sign ""own the libs""? Also, what do you mean by ""owning the libs""? Do you mean that white nationalists are using the sign as some form of protest against ""libs"" (which I assume means ""people who are not white nationalists"" which is a thankfully large portion of the population) rather than as a symbol of ""white pride""? That means it isn't a sign of hatred, it's a sign of children being childish.

If white nationalists are using the OK sign to ""own libs"", then they're simply displaying how much they feel that their ideology is under threat. This is a good thing because their ideology IS, rightfully, under threat.

White nationalists and their ilk deserve to feel that society is at war with their ideology, and their petulant attempt to co-opt the benign popularity of the OK sign shows that society is (slowly) winning the war."
