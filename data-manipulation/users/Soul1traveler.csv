 So he fights through the horrible feeling to gag, and when she pulls it out, a long thin strand of it trails out where it had dripped down his throat. I guess she used too much, and when she pressed it in to imprint, it just had nowhere to go but down."

 I quit smoking weed and drinking a month ago and it *really* helped me realise how much I was using them to cope with my depression and anxiety. Its a bandaid, not a solution. And its expensive, and as my tolerance went up, I needed more to get myself to the point that I felt functional, and then it stopped working and I started drinking all day everyday.

Not to say thats whats gonna happen or is happening to you, but lashing out on random people on reddit and trying to act cool because you smoke weed is not really the way you should want to present yourself to people."
