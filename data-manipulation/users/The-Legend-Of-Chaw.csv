memes,feiae49,t1_feia0wx,1579133884.0,"Well, in the game ‘Grand Theft Auto V’ players are asked to complete challenges, such as but not limited to: stealing motor vehicles, collecting bounties, stealing/acquiring illegal goods, etcetera. One such challenge is stealing cargo vans (like the one pictured above), and delivering them to your warehouse, to be sold at a later date for in game money.
