dauntless,fekswnn,t3_epiohp,1579206925.0,"Oh totally. But prior to match you can stipulate what you want to be primarily. BS or LH. Bohemoth slayer or loot hunter. If you choose bs your power is greater but only on the bohemoth, and your armor is slightly weakened.
LH,
Your armor is stronger but only on the barrier for the loot and your weapon is slightly weakened.

This could be more of a mode. 

With a required 4 people. Max 8.

The smaller the party the harder it is and the larger the payout.

It could be timed.
To ensure full participation and provide the needed constraint."
