todayilearned,fdn6ub1,t1_fdll9qf,1578578892.0,"Sounds like you got too high or don't get high very often, drove a little, and freaked yourself out because you thought you couldn't do it. Where, in reality, you were probably driving completely fine. The opposite happens with alchohol."

todayilearned,fdn6hwh,t1_fdkvwyy,1578578623.0,"Maybe you got too high a few times, I smoke more than triple that (not sure why you included that number anyway) and couldn't be more comfortable, safe, and attentive when behind the wheel. I notice 10x more effect on my driving from one beer than I do from being completely baked.




Driving impaired is a dick thing to do, and you are a douchebag if you do it. 


But luckily, weed doesn't impair my driving. Maybe it does for a 16 year old ripping bongs for the first time, but literally not at all for me. The differences in tolerance and effect from alcohol cannot be stressed enough."
cars,fdm6fxj,t3_elut0l,1578540947.0,Crashed on the highway at 75 mph in the rain because of an obstacle in the road and my airbag didn't go off less than a month ago. Luckily me and the 3 kitties I had In the car were fine but it was insane. The tow truck driver was like wtf because my bumper was ripped off and the sensor was destroyed but the bag didn't go.

videos,fc93834,t1_fc92few,1577546302.0,"Look at the recidivism rates for Norway, Finland, and Sweden. They treat their criminals like royalty compared to us and  90%+ of criminals never re-offend. That's why it seems like reforming people doesn't work for you, because WE are doing it WRONG. We are throwing dogs who stole a piece of meat from the dinner table in a cage with a pack of wolves; and expecting them to get BETTER while they are in there."

videos,fc91qo6,t1_fc8plx4,1577545625.0,"Except the judicial system should be trying to reform the driver, to insure that something like this never happens again. If all we want is revenge than we may as well torture him, but that adds nothing to society and doesnt do anything good. Is it better to have a person locked up for 50 years, costing lots of money, or is it better to reform them after 5 years and let them re-enter society. It's hard to be objective about things like this but we need to look at other countries and how they do it."
