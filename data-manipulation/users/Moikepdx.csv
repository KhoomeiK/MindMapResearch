AdviceAnimals,fgueo9n,t1_fgu0l3d,1581118958.0,"You seem to be conflating two different definitions of the word ""right"". I used the word only in the sense of ""correct, proper and acceptable"". You are using the word in this sense (i.e. when you wrote ""right and wrong are relative now""), but then are using a different definition when you refer to the bill of rights and the desire for rights. These usages refer to the very different meaning ""a moral or legal entitlement"". We could debate whether all American citizens should have the right (entitlement) to vote in the election, since clearly they do not have the right (entitlement) now. But what I said is that it is right (correct, proper and acceptable) that American citizens should be able to vote for their president.

Right and wrong in a moral sense have always been relative, with usually minor differences in opinion between people. But as people have moved toward claiming that what is right is defined by the law or current status, we have given way to greater moral relativism, where one group may argue that the status quo is moral since it is the law, while another argues that a change to the law is necessary and morally justified.

I would also note that these two differing viewpoints are largely embodied by the major political parties in the US. Republicans are (usually) arguing for maintaining the current status, or even moving back to the way things were historically. It makes some sense that the wealthy often prefer this option, since any advantages they enjoyed that allowed them to become wealthy could be removed with change. And if they happened to be advantaged and become wealthy under the historical system, they believe it's because they followed the rules, so they were perfectly justified.

On the other hand, people who feel a moral obligation to re-examine and re-level the playing field regularly (and possibly even give historically disadvantaged people some assistance to make up for past imbalances) are more progressive in their thinking and tend to fall on the side of the Democrats."

I say supermodels get approached less because that is what supermodels say, not because a PUA said it. I tend to believe people when they give a first-person account. This dynamic does not apply to women who fall within the normal range of hotness, only those that are ""off the scale"". It probably applies less now than it used to, since so many people hearing the ""approach anyway"" advice. But the vast majority of men are still too intimidated to approach the hottest women.

2) Republicans fear that Democrats are trying to skew elections (resulting in accusing Democrats of voting multiple times, rounding up homeless people to vote in multiple precincts, encouraging illegal aliens to vote, etc).

3) Since the Democrats are cheating, if the Republicans cheat it is only to restore fairness. This cheating is therefore justified.

This may stem from an underlying biological difference: Older men can still father children, while older women reach menopause and cannot.

I went for a closed-mouth kiss... she instantly shoved her tongue down my throat as far as she could like a chameleon that thought my uvula was an insect. It wasn’t pleasant or romantic at all. I didn’t go for a second kiss.

Your description doesn’t identify what went wrong, so here are some general pointers:

1) Your lips shouldn’t be dry, even if you’re not “deep kissing”. Make sure they have a little moisture on them. The lips should slide over each other. If you want to figure out what it should feel like, try rubbing one or 2 of your fingers over your own lips. Figure out how much pressure and what movement speed feels good. Use that knowledge during the kiss!

2) Do something with your hands. Good options include putting them on her waist just above the hips (you can pull her in slightly and squeeze lightly during the kiss) or one hand on her neck or cheek on the far side from the one you are approaching. Back of the neck also works if you are straight on. Touch should be light, sensual, and guiding her slightly (as if leading a dance).

3) Try concentrating on one thing - say her lower lip. Put your lips on either side and suck at her lip very slightly. Keep moving a little. After a second or two shift to her other lip or another spot.

4) Don’t be afraid to use your tongue to moisten while kissing even if you aren’t putting it into her mouth. It’s often best to tease with the tongue first even if you do intend to move on to an open mouthed kiss. If she is doing the same, you may get some light tongue contact here.

5) Timing- let it feel natural. Don’t make it too quick like you are scared of her, but don’t force it to last artificially either. You can back off and move in again. No rush!

6) Enjoy the sensations and focus your attention on her lips. Try to be fully in the moment. 

Hopefully your next kiss will be better. Congratulations on getting the first one out of the way!"

1) Delaying or withholding the payment of funds allocated lawfully by congress is a crime. So a crime actually did occur when Trump engaged in this behavior.
2) Obstruction of congress is also a crime. By hiding evidence and lying, plus refusing lawful subpoena while arguing simultaneously that: A) Executive privilege allows him to be exempt from any subpoena by congress. If they really want to enforce a subpoena it must be done through the federal courts; and B) The federal courts have no jurisdiction in the matter due to separation of powers.

Dershowitz has as much as admitted (on an interview with NPR) that his legal argument doesn't actually hold water in this case. The only way the republicans have maintained the argument is by segmenting the case so that Dershowitz makes a theoretical constitutional argument that interfering absent a crime is OK, while other members of Trump's team argue that he has committed no crime.

However, under wet conditions the rear sliding out does become an issue first. Further, when the front starts to slide the driver feels it and can brake to add traction the the front, simultaneously slowing the vehicle to bring it under control and improving turning ability. In contrast, if the rear slides the driver won’t feel it in the wheel and once it begins to slide, braking (the natural reaction of inexpert drivers) will shift weight away from the rear, decreasing traction further and causing the vehicle to slide out.

TalesFromRetail,fg0k9ic,t1_ffzuwco,1580409494.0,"False. No... not just false, this is dangerously and absurdly false.

Look up recommendation for installation of tire chains. When it really counts, front is the recommendation. The only exception is for rear-wheel-drive since you need traction on the drive wheels to go anywhere. Having steering is far more important than having more drag in the rear. Steering is also the only way to recover from a slide. You can continue to corner if your rear wheels start to slide out. You cannot do so if your front tires won’t turn the vehicle. Total loss of vehicle control is far more catastrophic than a little instability in the rear. 

Besides, having 2 good front tires will prevent the loose rear scenario anyway. I’ve driven with chains in ice enough to know.

Edit: See my further response below. Although front is more critical for snow/ice, apparently the reverse is true under wet conditions. Accordingly, the recommendation for better tires in the rear is neither more dangerous nor absurd."

AskReddit,ffxbdq4,t1_ffwwn08,1580321676.0,"The number of times I’ve seen this false fact boggles the mind. A theory is not a fact, and this theory is far from proven. In races between man and man on a horse over long distances the man on the horse still wins. An unladen horse would be doing less work and have better cooling (no saddle or rider to retain heat). Further, the whole theory is predicated on other animals inability to cool, which means even if true it would only apply in warm climates.

The theory arose by thinking that historically humans may have run down their prey to exhaustion. That assumes we were a bit stupid by not thinking to use tools/projectiles despite having opposable thumbs, but worse it assumes we couldn’t choose to go after slower animal species, or even younger, older or weaker animals within a herd. Nobody would ever be trying to run the healthiest, fastest animal to exhaustion since it makes zero sense to do so.

This is a bad theory based on flawed logic and misunderstanding of evolution combined with unstated assumptions about limitations of performance capabilities of land animals based on weather. These flaws make the theory ridiculous. 

P.S. This isn’t the worst garbage theory to get significant media attention. For that, look to “we will never colonize the stars”.
