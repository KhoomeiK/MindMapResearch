I don't see how it is that different. The Tiger is a bit more resilient, but a bit worse against infantry. The Pershing is a little less resilient, but a bit better against infantry.

Just look at the hard stats of the tank, it is perfectly serviceable.

Jokes aside, don't understimate the use of smoke to assault enemy positions, specially if you can get something like a KV-8 close to the enemy line. 

Other than that, artillery works, specially the BM-13, the ML-20 and the B-4. I am a bit partial to the ML-20 due to the long salvoes, but  realistically the BM-13 is the better option. Get recon over the area to increase accuracy, and if you have heavy artillery deployed, be wary of Stukas dropping 50 kg bombs on them."

A bit sidetracking into real world territory, but I think it is worth it because sorts of follow that logic for a couple of weapons. 

With WW 2 and the advent of the general purpose machine gun (namely the MG 34 and the MG 42) the same weapon can have the roles of both a light machine gun and a heavy machine gun depending simply on the configuration.

For example, the MG 42 with a bipod and a 50 round belt in an assault drum is considered an LMG (light machine gun), being its more mobile incarnation. As such, it is the squad weapon of the Grenadiers. 

Meanwhile, the same weapon, but with a 250 round belt and mounted in a Lafette 42 tripod is now an HMG, a heavy machine gun. Less mobile, but with much increased firepower, up to 3,5 km effective range. Gunners would keep multiple ammo boxes and belts, and spare barrels (spare water in the case of the Maxim or the Vickers, for example) to keep the weapon firing through continuous periods of time. That would be the MG 42 weapon team deployed from the Kampfgruppe HQ. 

A succint explanation of the different types can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8aAXsJRzTM)
