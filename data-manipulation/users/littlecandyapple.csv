RBI,ff7jycb,t3_es07nm,1579651323.0,Never heard an English person use the word mailbox & this is definitely an adult trying to mimic ‘creepy’ handwriting or a child’s. Call the police or stop karma farming smh

UnresolvedMysteries,fent9qz,t1_fenj4be,1579290477.0,Thanks for sharing! This is really interesting. The part where it says the hitman might have took her ring to show that the hit was completed makes me wonder if the man who murdered the Marions did the same with the custom ring. Maybe he got the wrong Marion first.
