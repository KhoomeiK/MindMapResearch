Here in the UK, when I was little you used to have a license for a dog - they got rid of the system some time ago. But a license, kinda like a driving license, that shows you're a responsible person around animals. And a conviction for animal cruelty should get you a ban. 

It's so easy and rewarding to be nice to a dog - just feed them, exercise them, and they'll love and protect you. It's not hard. Someone who can intentionally abuse this relationship has something broken in them. Dogs shouldn't be seen just as property, but as almost-people."

Here in the UK there's a housing crisis - people these days just can't afford to buy unless they've got really good jobs or their parents can help. The numbers of people sleeping rough seems to be growing yearly, and there's no sign of house prices falling. Thing is, houses are an investment for many of the people who vote for the Tory party and many of its members - and building sufficient affordable housing could cause prices to drop. Plus a lot of them are landlords and like being able to charge high rents. I gather other countries have similar problems. Personally, I work full time and live in a van.

She was just getting her life back together and had to get up in court, look at the fucker, and relive all those horrible experiences. They really went into detail. She ended up getting a heroin habit - she said that was the only thing that numbed her enough to be able to deal with the process. Before, she'd been a smart young woman with a good job she was doing well at. IIRC he ended up serving a few years and then getting deported - but that didn't help her. I don't think a lot of people realise how damaging sexual violence - and the legal system - can be to the victims until it happens to someone they care about. I'd never criticise any victim for not wanting to report an assault, it's always down to them how they want to deal with it.

AskReddit,fe0m1lm,t1_fdzhixf,1578815860.0,I tend to find that the withdrawal from subutex is harder the longer you've been taking it. They don't tell you this.
AskReddit,fe0lmok,t1_fdyiktu,1578815646.0,"Ah yeah, I'm on buprenorphine. It feels much cleaner than methadone, like you're not on anything at all. It's easy enough to taper off, but the final step can lead to a couple of months of withdrawal. That said, methadone is fiercely addictive. I knew a woman on 80ml who was sent to prison for 4 months and they denied her methadone (this was in the 80s) she said she was just as sick on the day she came out as when she went in. Mind you, I am the only person I know who has successfully done a methadone reduction - it can be done, step by step. It worked for me because when I got to zero I got on a plane and didn't come back for eighteen months, and had a really supportive partner. Good luck.

Edit - I tapered the methadone *very* slowly, over maybe 8 or 10 months. When you're at 80ml you can drop 5 and not feel it, but when you're *on* 5, you dilute it half and half with water and remove one mil at a time."
AskReddit,fe0kzup,t1_fe0aswv,1578815294.0,"Hmm. Yeah, that's disconcerting. Maybe ask them what they're staring at? It's a bit hard to understand because I would never do that to someone unless they were staring at me. But I was brought up to believe it was rude."
AskReddit,fdye1gy,t1_fdxovek,1578778713.0,Indeed. We use a silicone gun to squeeze silicone from the tube. That doesn't fire anything either.
AskReddit,fdy8byd,t1_fdxs9am,1578777114.0,Can you reduce? Break up pills and slowly reduce your dosage? I'm also on opioids and a former heroin addict. Obviously if you're in physical pain and need the medication to stay pain-free you wouldn't want to reduce - but if it's just an addiction at this point you may want to address it sometime if it's bothering you.

WTF,fdxqz68,t1_fdxbgvj,1578772034.0,They're worth 5k and they're just flapping around town? I'm surprised they've not been stolen. Although they are clearly homing parrots - they could have been stolen a few times and just flew back to the zoo.
