Sure, the Confederacy was built on their idea of ""State's Rights""--which included the ""right"" of states to permit the keeping of Black people as slaves. It was a tragic attempt at a country based on horrific ideals, such as the ideal that one human can legitimately own another as property and treat them as objects.

Edit for those in doubt:

>In March 1861 the new vice president of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens, said in a speech at Savannah that the conflict over slavery was ""the immediate cause"" of secession. Stephens pronounced one of the charters of American civic nationalism, the Declaration of Independence, with its ringing affirmation that all men are created equal, to be false. ""Our new government is founded on exactly the opposite idea,"" said Stephens. ""Its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man; That slavery...is his natural and moral condition. This, our new Government, is the first in the history of the world based on this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth."" ([McPherson, in Gleeson and Lewis, 2014](https://www.sc.edu/uscpress/books/2014/7325.html))

Stephens's [Cornerstone Speech](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/) in full.

While there's a lot of nuance and complexity involved, the fact remains that the Confederacy was based on the idea that Black people belonged as property; this isn't ""revisionism"", **it's the very word of the Confederacy's vice president back in 1861!** I don't see how anyone could even attempt to argue against this; it's right there in black and white.

Ethics,fdjz0fp,t1_fdjxpl8,1578491839.0,"Interesting examples. I'll need to do more research on this. Thank you for taking the time to elaborate.

I do wonder about whether this trust extends to promises to never break up, though. Intuitively I'm inclined to think that promises like this are among the most frequently made and most frequently broken, in almost any society, even Japan (I'm inclined to try to do some more research on this somehow, although I'm not sure the data exists). 

On another note, I also do think that there have got to be some circumstances in which you would agree that it would be the right thing to break the promise. Maybe I'm wrong, but let's see. I would like to posit another scenario.

Say another couple, Sally and Chet, are in a similar situation. In this scenario, Sally made the promise to Chet.

Five years later, Chet develops a chain smoking habit. He smokes constantly; three packs a day. The smell of the smoke and smoke residue causes Sally to feel really sick, and the exposure to the second-hand smoke increases Sallys risk of a painful premature death.

Would you say that Sally needs to honor her promise to Chet, even though it's causing her to suffer a great deal, and may cause her to painfully die? Chet is either unable and/or unwilling to stop smoking. I do think that most people would agree that Sally is within her rights to break up with Chet and break her promise, for the sake of preserving her health and well-being, but of course that isn't proof in and of itself that Sally's escape would be ethical."

I don't agree. It's perfectly possible to promise to do something unethical knowingly, and also possible to promise to do something that seems ethical at the time, but actually would turn out not to be.

>To ask if it’s [ethical]* to do things even if those things are unethical—which is exactly what you’re doing by including unethical promises under the “always “ umbrella— is self negating.

The very purpose of the counterexample is precisely to illustrate the fact that keeping promises is not inherently ethical. The premise that it is ethical to keep ethical promises seems evident. The claim that ethical promises must be kept is a different claim from the premise that *all* promises must be kept. 

*(I hope you don't mind the small correction I made. Hopefully it was not in error. If it was, my apologies)

Another, more everyday example, could be a promise to never break up with someone. Breaking this promise could be a good thing if a relationship turns toxic and ends up harming one or both partners.

Say Ted and Red are a teen couple. Red says to Ted, ""Never break up with me. Promise!"". Ted says, ""Okay, I'll never break up with you. I promise"". Fast forward 10 years. Ted and Red are now nearing 30. The relationship has gone sour, and Ted wants to break up.

Breaking the promise is going to lead to a better outcome for Ted, and probably Red too. Ted isn't going to be able to provide Red with a good relationship because he's no longer in love with her, or even if he is, he can't be with her because they're no longer getting along. This is also going to cause problems for Ted's family relationships, work life, the list goes on (so parties that weren't even part of the promise are going to be negatively affected if Ted keeps it). Red is going to suffer from having a dysfunctional relationship with Ted, and neither of them are going to be happy.

I think you're right about that! But I think there would be a flip side to the coin.

An example that comes to my mind is a parent who takes the drug, and so they're pretty happy almost all the time. Without the anxiety and fear of something bad happening to their child, where is the motivation to be a good parent?
