I’m so sorry you went through this, please try to take care of yourself and don’t worry about what your friends would say. Seriously if they can’t support you are they really your friends?"
offmychest,fdma0m5,t1_fdl6l4q,1578543561.0,"My crazy ass just stares them down until they start to feel uncomfortable. I fricken hate men like that, seriously. I probably looked at you in the first place to see if I need to be wary of you possibly attacking me, do I look like I want to talk to you? 🙄 

This is exactly why I don’t even bother trying to fix my resting bitch face."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fdm9q3f,t1_fdkwwag,1578543341.0,Lol “hi I’m _____ and I will eat your first born and set a curse on you if you decide to send me a dick pic” 😬😂
MakeNewFriendsHere,fdm9n06,t3_elxlqt,1578543276.0,"I mean... I’m 23F from CANADA? That’s close enough right? 🤣 I like playing video games, reading, animals, cop shows, the real housewives, and anime. I’m also a truck driver. If you’re interesting in chatting feel free to send me a message!"
Advice,fdm7tag,t3_elxfy4,1578541925.0,"Let her know she isn’t any less of a woman for knowing these things. I’m a cis-woman truck driver who always has my nails done (I tend to switch between gel nails and acrylic), my hair done and down to my mid back, pink high-viz vest and pink steel toe boots. I pride myself in being able to do a ‘mans job’, being able to check my tire pressures in the morning, checking my trucks oil and coolant levels, climbing onto the hood to wash my windows while fuelling, scraping my box out when I get asphalt stuck in there. I love getting dirty, cheering when my favourite hockey team scores (GO JETS GO! 😁), eating whatever tf I was ant without worrying about looking ‘feminine’ enough. But I also love doing my face masks, and getting mani-pedi’s, I find it endearing when guys try to take care of me at work, etc. 

I actually work with a trans lady named Cindy and she’s still more ‘masculine’ in her own eyes. She knows she is a woman but doesn’t feel the need to show it with those extremes and that’s awesome! Other trans women feel differently and want to be very flamboyant and high-energy about it. She just needs to figure herself out and realize it’s okay to like ‘masculine’ things and still be feminine."
offmychest,fdk9b56,t1_fdk8lr4,1578498996.0,I’m trying. I can’t stand hearing from him anymore and I’m so done dealing with him.
Advice,fda9hew,t3_ekagek,1578243273.0,"Don’t ghost her, honestly? Call the police. You SHOULD be able to get her an involuntary psyche evaluation and she’ll be committed which seems to be what she needs. You actually have a legal obligation to inform law enforcement of her threatening to kill herself, because if you KNOW she’s been saying she’ll kill herself you can be held liable if she actually does. 

Keep in mind it’s her mental illness and in no way is it ever your fault what she does to herself. You didn’t flat out tell her to just do it, you didn’t support it, you obviously have been trying to stop that from happening so it’s NOT. YOUR. FAULT. ever. Take care of yourself, and if that means leaving her then do it, but make sure you contact the police with her threats/plans to kill herself. My ex had to do that to one of his ex’s actually. 

I’m hoping for all the best for you!"
CatAdvice,fd9rpoq,t1_fd70tis,1578237143.0,"Good to know! I don’t use a spray bottle for my cats usually, it’s never really worked with them."
CatAdvice,fd6y6sk,t1_fd6uh95,1578197180.0,"That’s interesting actually. It works with my one cat, and my other cat just calms down and then goes right back to what he was doing. I also heard spraying them with water doesn’t work but it used to work for my ex MIL."
CatAdvice,fd6tzwj,t3_ek5olc,1578195690.0,"It’s much better for them if you feed them about 2 to 3 times daily with wet only. My cats were like this as well and my vet gave me this advice:

When they beg for attention and get up in your face IGNORE THEM or they will constantly do it. Any attention is good attention so just completely ignore them until they behave or put them in a kennel until they are quiet. 

Don’t leave ANY form of food out, this took a lot of trial and error with my cats. Things that I didn’t expect them to go for they tore into (a sealed container of rice they somehow knocked over and tore the lid off) and MY PLANTS :(

And most importantly what was the game changer: feed at the exact same times every single day. I feed my cats a full can each at 6:30/7am and then half a can each at 7pm. Made a huge difference because apparently cats are very opportunistic hunters/eaters and so if they know that they can expect food at a certain time they don’t tend to get into as much and aren’t as desperate. 

I’m telling you, it works but it takes a lot of effort in the beginning and it will take some time. Just stick to it. My vet also said when I was trying to start my cats on a raw food diet that it’s about who’s more stubborn... if they realize that that’s what they’re getting they’ll eat it. They ultimately won because my one cat has a very sensitive stomach as it turns out 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Advice,fd6clql,t1_fd6cgrt,1578188917.0,"It’s completely fine, I felt the exact same way and I soooo wish I could vent! Like I said, it’s normal to feel frustrated and uncomfortable and stuff. Good luck, I hope things go well!"
Advice,fd6cbmo,t1_fd6ankt,1578188795.0,"Lmao I feel like I keep saying this but I completely get where you’re coming from. I get like that with my depression/anxiety as well, the only thing is I get very frustrated/angry/irritable when my anxiety gets too bad or I get overwhelmed. 

You seriously shouldn’t feel bad, it’s nothing you can REALLY control. Some people don’t like going on meds and that’s fine but it took me 5 years to find the right meds. What I’ve been doing when I notice I’m getting ‘lazy’ or whatever is doing one small thing, like get up and brush my teeth or brush my hair. Then later I’ll fold a couple clothes and call it a day. You don’t have to deep clean like a maniac every single day, it’s your home so you should be able to do what you want. And it’s okay to have those days where you don’t do ANYTHING. Baby steps. 

I can completely see how you would feel like you have no privacy, I would be so paranoid if my ex in-laws were able to just look out their window and see if I’m home lol. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m personally a very private person. If you can set those boundaries that’s amazing, seriously. I had that same kind of relationship with my ex’s mum, but she didn’t respect my boundaries and would get angry all the time. Always felt closer to her regardless. 

If you’ve been with your boyfriend long enough you could also try talking to your MIL on your own or with your boyfriend as a buffer? You could make it clear that you aren’t angry, you still want to spend time with her, you care for her etc. but that you would like to have those boundaries. It’s a difficult situation, I know, I literally went through the same thing and I wish I had been more firm with my boundaries. Your mental health and your relationship needs that space. I seriously wish you all the best! I know it’s a difficult situation, it can make you feel uncomfortable and I’m telling you you are NOT wrong for feeling the way you do."

She got both of her cats for free and they are so unhealthy it’s sick. The only one she paid for was her third cat, a Maine coon and she does actually take care of him (2 other cats aren’t vaccinated but the maine coon is, only baths and brushes him, only takes him to the vet, etc)."
Advice,fd4q7t7,t1_fd4p5n8,1578169998.0,"Honestly I completely understand where you’re coming from with wanting privacy. My mum was the same way, would always go through my stuff. 

Your points are completely valid and he has to start understanding that. My ex boyfriend was the exact same way with his mum, his mother was the exact same as your MIL and I talked to him about it many many times. He never got it, let his mum run our lives, she got to do everything she wanted and it got to the point where I couldn’t do it anymore. I REALLY hope he just gets it through his head that you don’t dislike her, you just want space and privacy. 

How is she able to get into your home? That would be where I would start off right then and there. Maybe tell her you lost your key so you need hers to cut another one and just never give it back? 😬"

Advice,fd4nj7c,t3_ek1qrx,1578169164.0,"Plain and simple you have to put your foot down and CALMLY tell your boyfriend that this is bothering you and it’s becoming to be a problem in your relationship. If he can’t stand up to his mum about it he’s probably not right for you, trust me, I’ve gone through this exact same scenario. Make it clear to him that you do still like your MIL but she can’t just pop by whenever she wants, eat all of your food, and smoke all of your weed."

offmychest,fbumdbp,t3_eeekzt,1577116828.0,"I live in Canada so I don’t have to worry about this as much (although I live in the murder capital of Canada 🙃) but I’m always concerned for those who live in America. As an outsider it’s crazy watching a country literally crumbling and overflowing with violence and darkness. Canada is getting there too, but it’s just crazy. There weren’t nearly as many school shootings when I was in school, and that was a minimum of 5 years ago. I hope America gets control of their gun violence issues, and what you did is so freakin’ sweet. I’m sorry you lost your love, it must have been so painful. I hope you heal and have a good life."
