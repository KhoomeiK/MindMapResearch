NoStupidQuestions,ff4btm0,t1_ff3frmq,1579559939.0,"Nah, it's just winter, the cat is getting cold...
But really, yes. The cat has gotten attached, and trusting. Like you do with a good servant that proved themself. My dad spent 13 years of his life sleeping askew because of acatthathedidnotwant."
worldpolitics,ff2ow95,t1_ff2b1fy,1579517025.0,"Well, at least you make every side of this discussion agree one thing. You are a turd with a chip on your shoulder, that is looking at his life and knows that it is crap, will be crap, and cannot be anything else than crap."
wallstreetbets,fezauk7,t1_feytx36,1579455473.0,You know what is cool also in Jersey and Guernsey? They have 1£ bills. Perfect for tipping the strippers. You cannot do that on the mainland.
imsorryjon,feybk6f,t1_feybexl,1579443306.0,You dare blasphem and call our Saviour an idiot!?
imsorryjon,fey6yq2,t3_eqw561,1579441557.0,"Good clear style, nicely done. We want more now. You are trapped."

witcher,feo7ldh,t1_feo71yc,1579296248.0,Thanks again. I really need to read the books.
witcher,feo63dr,t1_feo5zcf,1579295601.0,"So pure stupidity? 
Thank you!"

AbandonedPorn,fegs41h,t1_fef6y19,1579101249.0,I am getting strong Final Fantasy 7 flashbacks.
nocontextpics,febnncz,t1_fe8p23j,1578960754.0,"I went there on a foggy and rainy day, so there was absolutely nothing to see beyond the rock, in any direction. I kept expecting to see dragons emerge from the depth, it was terrifying."
TwoXChromosomes,fe8z762,t1_fe6czwq,1578932473.0,"I want to scream at the TV sometimes. Pretty much every times they show a discussion about abortion in TV series and movies, they pile on the fear and the regret even when they show a pro-choice stance. Very rarely do we see a woman that is matter of fact and relieved without the cliche ""I had to, but watch me suffer emotionally"".
It's as if there is a rule about forced grief in the Hollywood playbook."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdyo80p,t1_fdxe58u,1578781866.0,"Do you think those birds realise how gorgeous they are? Because he has a swagger that says he does, but I may be anthropomorphing."

Nah, the comments can be very gnarly tbh."
AskReddit,fdlssbe,t1_fdj8m2t,1578531638.0,"I know a 30 something Nimrod. Great guy, kinda proud of his name. But he is not from the US, UK, or an Englophone country."
europe,fdh3qek,t1_fdgrl5b,1578414726.0,"I remember growing up and understanding the world around me thanks to those cartoonists. The newspapers seemed daunting, but their satires drew me in and got me to read the whole articles as a child.
Yup, I will never forget. And definitively will not forgive."
HistoryMemes,fdh34k1,t1_fdgw3v3,1578414356.0,"Ah, yes, thank you for defining feminism, Mr.

Ps: nothing against Trans, btw. Just amusing to see a guy wading into this debate."
tumblr,fdgkrx3,t1_fdgkn3n,1578400635.0,It was not awesome. But Evan MG made a great Obi Wan. And Neeson was also a good worst Jedi Master of the Galaxy too.
MovieDetails,fdf8zy5,t1_fdf0yl8,1578356107.0,Nope. Not clicking. That movie claimed enough of my tears already.
ABoringDystopia,fdddw24,t1_fddduec,1578307688.0,"The 9, 23 and 27 buses drivers get thanked a lot."
ABoringDystopia,fdd77vn,t1_fdczmvl,1578297882.0,"We do thank the bus drivers in London, we are not savages. Yet."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fcxd94k,t1_fcxcxkd,1578059804.0,"Still talking about the Ottomans. Not the main religion. The leadership may have been of mixed blood, but the population using the slaves were not white.
But indeed, we were discussing the Sultans with friends not long ago, and it was a mindfuck to realise that they were likely more Russians by blood than Turkish."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fcxcrbb,t1_fcx24g2,1578059386.0,"Not really, the Ottoman white slave trade was still strong 500 years ago and much later."
HistoryMemes,fcuhbsd,t1_fcu02cp,1577980965.0,In France.
HistoryMemes,fcuh590,t1_fcu2367,1577980841.0,"London!! Where in some neighboroughs, you pretty much only hear French."
marvelmemes,fct3qjq,t1_fcsvv98,1577932094.0,"If the Accords had been signed, Pepper and Peter would have been on the list and open for conscription. Banner, his good buddy, would have been put under the thumb of his worst bully, and he supported the creation of the Insight project.
I love Tony, I do, but the man messed up."
AskHistorians,fcr929o,t3_eidzs6,1577898542.0,Can we have an answer? I am genuinely curious now and most posts are deleted.
religiousfruitcake,fcr6lfl,t1_fcr6bm2,1577897538.0,"I am a Catholic (pretty lax one tho). I do not really feel any kinship with many Evangelical trends from the US, so I understand the occasional confusion tbh.
Religion is strictly personal, and has no place in politics, Schools and laws."
religiousfruitcake,fcr60su,t1_fcqpayz,1577897290.0,Catholics are Christians. And she was a fruitcake.

tippytaps,fcnc8bz,t1_fcnbtr4,1577808567.0,"Kids had the hype of Christmas, have been spoiled like mad. Then the days after, they are still excited, have more gifts than they know what to do with but are still hoping for more. They are over stimulated and morph into little assholes. It settles quickly but you still want to yeet them out of the window for those 2-3 days."
tippytaps,fcnb6aw,t1_fcn2jfx,1577807856.0,"No matter what you do, those little kids have no rule no creed. You can be the best parent and they WILL make you look like a dumbass. Like tiny little agents of chaos."

tippytaps,fcmtoek,t1_fcmbco8,1577791746.0,"I love my nieces, I really do, but if you spoil a dog with toys, you will get endless enjoyment and no entitlement or tantrums. Pure Joy. You do that with a kid and you get a bratty 5yo. (The Christmas aftershocks are kicking in, if you were wondering...)"
AmItheAsshole,fcmrow0,t1_fcmh90p,1577788920.0,"I would actually look at the behaviour of the wife with the daughter. The mum's insecurity may be part of a wider range of strange behaviours, some targeted at the daughter. She may be the one threatening to withhold love regularly, especially when nobody else is here."
HistoryMemes,fchy3f4,t1_fchtcxr,1577655484.0,"His brother was also a prisoner, but drank the kool aid and a little bit more, making Vlad even more salty."

dataisbeautiful,fcfqmnj,t1_fcd40bx,1577632768.0,I read on Reddit some times ago that a Japanese survivor was laid off after the catastrophe because it was dishonourable to have survived.
