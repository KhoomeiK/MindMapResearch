AskReddit,ffcqdg6,t1_ffbvgyb,1579805029.0,"This especially hits home working in the medical field. Sometimes the worst part is seeing how devastated the family gets seeing their loved one not remember them, or even get agitated and lash out and hurt themselves and others. Sometimes it’s seeing the glimpse of who they used to be, and their struggle to hold on to those ever increasingly fleeting moments.

I hope medical euthanasia is an option if I get get to that point."

AmItheAsshole,feyng4k,t1_fexvn9z,1579447960.0,"If you have such terrible chronic pain, maybe speak with the host beforehand to sure you can be accommodated. People need to take an active role in their health rather than expect the world to cater to them. 

This especially tends to apply if you have an “invisible” disability or are grossly obese. The general public likes visual proof that someone needs extra considerations, and unless someone is obese themself most people tend to have a level of disgust rather than empathy. It’s unfortunate but is a reality. 

And really, what adult throws such a childish tantrum toward an elderly animal? This person seems to be absolutely revolting inside and out. NTA"

nursing,fepqk4j,t1_fem26bz,1579327948.0,Yes! But mine has two inflections. The first is talking nice to the cute old person. The second is the bless your heart/fuck off tone to the asshole giving me problems. My coworkers can tell the difference and it’s apparently amusing.
nursing,fepq9ou,t1_fekdk2t,1579327684.0,Yes. Always use worst case scenario to convey both the need for efficiency and to provide of sense of I know what the fuck I’m doing. Works every time!
nursing,fepq5we,t1_fekajp9,1579327587.0,"With my neutral expression I’ve gotten the whole “well you don’t look very sorry.” My now truthful response is, “due to Botox injections I am physically incapable of making the facial expression you desire.” Obviously I’m not that frozen, but it seems to throw people off enough that they shut up for a moment.

news,fepcqmm,t1_feol3ao,1579317314.0,Unfortunately it seems like an inordinately high number of people don’t know their own medical history or even what medications they take or why. I’m always happy to see a well informed patient that can advocate for themself in an educated manner. It really does make it less complicated and and faster to treat an issue when you can a complete background to start with.

AmItheAsshole,fdhb0e2,t3_ele17v,1578419152.0,YTA. My husband is a big gamer. He doesn’t collect any toys or cards but is big with games and upgrading his pc and electronics. I tend to buy high end clothing. A casual outfit would equal or exceed what your wife wanted to spend on an every day handbag. You’re lucky she isn’t buying multiple designer bags at a few thousand each. If my husband ever tried to police what I spent my money on (we are a child free couple that each earns about an equal amount) there would be some serious issues.

The only one that I actually like is snap kitchen. The food is filling and almost all their entrees are in the 300-400 cal range.

PlasticSurgery,fdgeaaz,t1_fdfxpc4,1578392703.0,"I agree with this. I’m an average weight and had full body lipo with great results. At the time of sx I contemplated chin lipo and/buccal fat removal. The sx refused bc of exactly what you said. That as I age my face would loose its youthfulness faster and look wane. As much as I’d like that snatched jawline with absolutely no fat when I put my chin to chest it’s just not worth the long term repercussions.
