Python,ff6aur1,t1_fanfeuu,1579623149.0,"Imagine you're building a website with django, for example. You might need a specific version of the django library, and you might need to keep it for years and years. You want to keep it even if django introduces changes to its behaviour later, so that your code keeps functioning.

And the same goes for every single dependency in your project. Say you need the package unidecode, the same explanation applies. You might want one specific version. Well poetry (and pipenv) allows you to do that. You create an ""environment"", which will only be used for this one project you're building. ""Inside"" of it, you will have all your dependencies installed, in the correct version.

And even if you don't care about one specific version (because, let's face it, django e.g. is not likely to introduce many backwards incompatible changes, at least I think), it's still pleasant to be able to copy your working directory to your production server, and run just one command that will install everything you need to get it running."
