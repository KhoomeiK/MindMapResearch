pcmasterrace,fegs4zv,t3_eozhu6,1579101266.0,"Ok, I have never seen that model of dell monitor in that color before. Good monitors. I have a dell E177FP. it was made in June 2006 and I have had it since 2012. It still works great nearly 8 years later! It was given to me by my mother, from a garage sale, dubbed the Un-sale, at her work, where everything is free. This monitor was the first flat panel computer monitor to ever enter my household, and the second flat panel, after a 32-inch Sony Bravia HDTV, to enter my household overall."

hardwaregore,fe450t3,t3_ema4mz,1578855842.0,"From that grounding screw, a wire is soldered on to it which trails on to the board, ending with a soldered point. Midland made the WR-100 from 2002 through 2012. I've had my WR-100 since new in 2009. I bought my WR-120 in 2016. I love these radios. The WR-300 came from a thrift store for $3.99. I snatched it right up. That one was made in 2011. Hey, take yours apart and post some photos and I may be able to diagnose why the antenna broke. PM me."
hardwaregore,fe3nr81,t3_ema4mz,1578851136.0,"Ok. I just took my WR-100 apart again. The antenna is attached internally via a ground screw which is screwed into the plastic bottom half of the casing. I'm afraid part of it may have broken, resulting in the antenna falling out."
hardwaregore,fe3lgj6,t3_ema4mz,1578850357.0,"I own a WR-100 i.e the same model in your picture, a WR-120 (which is the WR-100, but redesigned), and a WR-300. All of them can use an external antenna. Unless you have basic soldering skills by which the connection is made internally, there is no easier way to fix it. I had no intention of being rude if that's how you took it. I accidentally broke the antenna off my first WR-100, so I replaced the unit under a 30-day return policy my local Target had."
