AskReddit,ffmh38d,t1_ffm7ugt,1580054612.0,"It makes a little sense... and at the same time I’ve been where you are. Accepting help is hard. It’s embarrassing to let someone see the mess, and it goes against everything on my core telling me that I have to be self-sufficient at all times. The problem with me doing things myself (and possibly you as well) is that I will get part of the way done and begin feeling much better about myself and my situation... then promptly slide back into where I was before. Or something will happen and I’ll have a week of being extra depressed, make a mess again and “give up” until my house is gross. 

The only way I’ve been able to keep my place clean long term and avoid sliding back into old habits is to hire someone. I schedule the cleaning lady as an incentive when I notice the mess starting to return. I don’t want her to walk into a hoarding situation or something extra messy/gross and having her scheduled means I’ll wash all the dishes and pick up/declutter my worst areas before cleaning day."

trashy,fesz2kk,t3_eq9fen,1579370345.0,"Get your TP, bread, lettuce, marshmallows, *whatever* in your hand, reach behind and under until you make contact with your taint. Don’t stop too early, you have to actually touch down— but wait, you’re not done yet! Don’t just tap. Touch down, and then slowly drag upwards, toward the small of your back. Be careful to follow the curve of your rear, don’t lose contact even for a second. You’ll feel the wipe going across your butthole and that’s exactly how it should be, that means you’re doing it correctly. When you get to the end of your crack, lift off. I highly recommend folding your tp in half (or getting another slice of bread) and doing it once more to make sure you’ve cleaned yourself properly. It’s always a good idea to take a quick peek at your wipe afterward, too. This way you can see if it’s still dirty and you could use another pass (or three), and to check for things like tiny worms wiggling about, or drops of bright red blood that could alert you to health concerns. After everything is complete, discard your wipe in an appropriate place— the toilet or a trash can. Then wash your hands! Scrub them up with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, then rinse throughly and pat dry. Hand sanitizer can help in a pinch, but is not as effective so it’s still important to wash your hands as soon as you have access to a sink. Good luck with everything!"
