Also whenever we go there, at the airport we get to skip all the hassle of customs and everything because a close relative who's retired but has a high position in the airport pays the officials off, equivalent of maybe 30£ or so.

That two types of seas dont mix? It's in the Quran.
The process in the womb? It's in the Qur'an.
The universe is expanding? It's in the Quran.
The earth's core is a hot fiery place? The Qur'an says that disbelieving souls will go to a place deep inside the earth, implying some sort of place of punishment.

And then you have the countless literary miracles in the Quran as well that could not have been made by a human, let alone an illiterate Prophet. 
Research it, studies (by non Muslims even) have found so many complex techniques. 

And then, why would Muhammad (pbuh) talk about his own mistakes in the Qur'an? How would he know of future events either? After the Romans were defeated by the Persians, the Qur'an declared that the Romans would defeat the Persians and that happened."
