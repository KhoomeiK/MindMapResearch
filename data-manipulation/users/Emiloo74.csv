fatlogic,fgli2io,t1_fglg697,1580898862.0,No worries! It means latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.
fatlogic,fgkbpab,t3_eyrcxb,1580861848.0,"Rave: Finally broke out of the 160s this weekend. Not by much, but it is the downward trend I have been working toward for months.

Rant: I feel like a busted can of biscuits in my pants. Blobby and doughy forever! I know this is like a body tax for having been so obese for so long. ""I am losing weight and nothing fits! Nothing fits because I am a free-form dough ball...ooooh."" 

I will get over this feeling, I know. It is so frustrating, though, and makes my efforts feel futile. I know I cannot change the past, but I often wish I had never gotten to and stayed at the point of morbid obesity. It was not fun or empowering. 

Gonna go sit with my grumpy self and read about structured and unstructured data to get my mind off this loop."
fatlogic,fgk6tyo,t1_fgjo11m,1580858729.0,"Whew! I have been there with estrogen pills, even the low dose ones. Fingers crossed you get regulated with your break! 

Will you be able to use the mini pill later, if estrogen is a no go? Mini pill was the shit for me! YMMV."
fatlogic,fgk6iqt,t1_fgjsflc,1580858536.0,You got this!
fatlogic,fgk6b2v,t1_fgk164q,1580858406.0,"Ooo. I hate how people feel their bodies are sacred and must not be commented on, but they are free to say shit about other people and their bodies."
fatlogic,fgk5zu2,t3_eywljh,1580858216.0,I wonder what the fascination is with size 2 and weighing 105 pounds? Those are both things I have heard through my life.
fatlogic,fgk5oia,t1_fgk2c50,1580858028.0,Yeah. I am LADA T1 and not thrilled with their flippant attitude toward diabetes. I guess they'll get it whenever their shit progresses. IDEK.
progresspics,fgk17l8,t3_eyxref,1580855395.0,Yesssss! Great of you to make the comparison. It always helps.
MurderedByWords,fgjzmyo,t3_eyxzn4,1580854519.0,Damn. That is good.
cats,fgiavda,t3_eyogfn,1580814620.0,"We use an air can for our cats when they go where they aren't allowed. Scares them with the sound initially, then the mere threat of the can gets them scooting away."
worldnews,fggbrw8,t3_eybred,1580758521.0,I don't know whether to laugh or cry. WTF.
mildlyinfuriating,fggbicz,t3_eybstr,1580758361.0,I will sometimes do that to mess with my younger coworkers. It gives me lulz.
PoliticalHumor,fg7vaic,t1_fg7u4cz,1580602349.0,My opinion is they know their base supporters will gladly eat a shit-filled lie over the truth.
PoliticalHumor,fg7sbay,t1_fg7o3fm,1580600231.0,I have read as much as I can and nothing weird or fucky was found re: Hunter Biden being on the board. It is a desperate lie they cling to for whatever reason.
progresspics,fg7qujg,t3_exebtx,1580599173.0,Awesome!
food,fg7qmna,t3_exeeky,1580599016.0,My husband would love it. Thank you for sharing!
todayilearned,fg217ln,t1_fg1uu41,1580436337.0,Yep. I saw them at some festival and got the pissiest vibe from the singer. The other guys were just rocking out.
fatlogic,fg20u4q,t1_fg209b1,1580436164.0,"Damn it, Emiloo. Fair game! 

Yes. It would have helped her vision, too."
mildlyinfuriating,fg1rcho,t3_ewf4n5,1580432070.0,Was she hangry when she opened the bag?
todayilearned,fg1q6wi,t1_fg1q3zq,1580431614.0,That's not surprising.
fatlogic,fg1nvic,t3_evgf4b,1580430507.0,"So, I am due to regain the 90 lbs I've lost since 2007? All at once? Well, shit. That jams up my plans."
fatlogic,fg1nk8n,t1_ffzn4sa,1580430344.0,"It does not feel good, that's for sure."
fatlogic,fg1mvwf,t1_fg1i60w,1580429978.0,"That drew a ""holy FUCK"" from me. What in the hell is wrong with people wanting that as a memory?"
