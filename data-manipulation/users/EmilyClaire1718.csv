Familial status or being able to get to college before 22/23 doesn't matter as much as it did in the very beginning of adulthood. 

There's always going to be better or worse, and if you're anything like me your goals will grow with what you've achieved (which causes me to feel like I'm consistently not measuring up.. when in reality the goal post just keeps on moving up. )

Make sure you take the time to recognize what you have accomplished and Pat yourself on the back for the work you HAVE done, even when the odds seemed to work against ♥️"

antinatalism,fedvncn,t1_fed235g,1579020856.0,"Suffering by definition is linked to pain and hardship. If you are having a good time then you are not suffering. If you are feeling anything BUT negatively, then it is not suffering. 

You could link anything we all collectively consider 'bad' and assert that its only subjective. Genocide, slavery, torture etc. And we only care about its effects because of lived experiences or trauma. 

Does that take away the impact? No. Does that shut down the impact? No. 

I feel you're being incredibly intellectually dishonest. If you disagree with the subject matter that's 100% fine. But don't sit there n say that the feeling attributed to negative and bad experiences/emotions isn't inherently bad."

My strong aversion to (mostly) leafy greens makes iron and protein a LOT harder to come by. I'm still doing my best to work around it and to get myself to start liking it because I'm sticking to being vegetarian. 

It honestly just takes more forethought than to just throw some chicken in the oven and maybe that's why it's harder for people? I'm teaching myself nutrition and asking for help so I do get more vitamins but it does take considerable more effort. 

Maybe that's why people find so many excuses?

I'm a little bit in the diet anti-natalist side.. I feel like MOST births are unethical. 

If we look at humanities impact on the billions of other species that inhabit this planet thoughtlessly adding more multiplies suffering across the board... Especially when there are SO MANY human beings already. We are in no danger of dying out. But we are in danger of destroying our planet and ourselves by endlessly multiplying (see, climate change) 

A more personal reason for me has to do with the wealth inequalities and the overall quality of life I experience in the USA. 

Of course, the only person over whom I can enforce these anti-natalist ideas are over myself. I can just hope to encourage others to really measure the impact of pro-creating themselves."
