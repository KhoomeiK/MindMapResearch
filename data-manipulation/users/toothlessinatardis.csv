offmychest,ff4f2qr,t3_erhisj,1579562083.0,"Agreed. I had a bf cheat on me twice - once I didn't know about at all until after we'd broken up, the other I suspected during the build-up of it happening. The second time around, he cheated on me multiple times a week for about 4 months. He'd also cheated on his girlfriend before me with a girl, Kayla, who was cheating on her bf with him.

Kayla got mad when her bf, who lived across the country, started dating someone else before breaking it off with her, but not long after he started dating that other girl. Kayla now basically exclusively dates married men. When with her friends, she jokes about her current tryst's family - including the children. All of her friends hate cheaters as well but laugh along with her jokes and everything while I sit there feeling uncomfortable. I don't know if she's on Ashley Madison or some garbage or how she finds these dudes otherwise, but if I knew their names, I'd tell their wives in a *heartbeat*. Even if they knew about it, at least I'd feel like I'd done my due diligence.

Like, if you're in a polyamorous relationship or something, you do you, boo. But it's not for everyone and you don't do that junk without first talking to your significant other. Hiding it means ill-intent. Which means you don't care about the feelings of your significant other. Which, to me, means you don't deserve any sympathy from anyone if they ever call you on your sh\*t or blast your business to the public - you made it public when you decided to look outside your relationship, even if you tried to keep it secret. Maybe that makes me an AH but having been through it and learning pretty much EVERYONE else knew about it but just didn't tell me, it's embarrassing as hell and really hurtful because I legitimately loved him. He deserves to be just as embarrassed, IMO. People already knew anyway."

AmItheAsshole,fevank8,t3_eqlbl1,1579395179.0,"100% NTA. I'm currently pregnant and have always known (even years before getting pregnant) that the only person in the room with my will be my boyfriend. I want one person whose actions I can anticipate and accept in there - and that is my boyfriend and no one else. None of my mothers, not my dad, ...though honestly, MAYBE my SIL if she were able to be there because she's the most calming person I know and I could probably use that.

It makes sense that your husband's sister would have your MIL in the room, it's HER mother. It's not YOUR mother. Not that she has more right to be in the delivery room when it was her daughter if she didn't want it, but MIL has even less so with you. Yes, you married into the family, but that connection isn't the same for everyone and she had absolutely no right to go in the room like that as she already knew you didn't want her there. More so, so did your husband. Your MIL knew better and decided what you wanted didn't outweigh her position as a grandmother and your husband took advantage of your state at the time to try and let her sneak in.

I don't think you need to feel too bad about it, he did it to himself (I'm not saying it would be easy to not feel bad as I'm the type of person to feel bad if that happened to me as well even though my whole family knows my plan). If he hadn't taken advantage of your state of mind at the time, a kind of ""it's better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission"" thing, then he would've been there. Giving birth isn't the time to mess with someone's emotions. It is the absolute WRONG time. Like...one of the wrongest times there can be. And unfortunately, he learned that the hard way. Also should've been more attuned to you and noticed how panicked you were getting and end up snapping back to reality and get his mother out of there."

AmItheAsshole,feazi1g,t3_eo6j73,1578953872.0,"I have two adopted sisters from what is considered a 3rd world country, they have always been fully aware of their country of birth, the fact that they're adopted (they celebrate both their birthdays and a combined ""Gotcha Day"" as the youngest's original ""gotcha"" day is only a month after her birthday), and knew that their foster mother until my parents were able to get them was their biological grandmother. TBH, one of them, when upset, used to threaten to go back to her home country all the time (she is also very very spoiled, more spoiled than the older sister for sure) and my parents would say, ""If you want to, we can absolutely visit and you can tell us what you think then."" This would make her backtrack some, but I know if the opportunity came up, they would both be interested to meet their biological parents though they are quite content with the life they have right now. They are biological half-sisters, so their fathers would be different, and I think that interests them even more because there would be more to learn about not only themselves, but each other.

I also have a cousin and an uncle who were adopted (my uncle married into the family). I've been around it for a long time and while I haven't experienced firsthand, I have seen/learned what my sisters go through. But even without that experience, I don't think it's hard for anyone who hasn't adopted a child to understand that they will grow up to be curious about their birth family, and whether you like it or not, she does have another mother. One who couldn't support her, but it doesn't necessarily mean she didn't want her, she did what was best for her family and her child under the circumstances. Your daughter obviously sees you as an important figure in her life, *you raised her*, and I think this is something she wants to experience with you. To kind of be like, ""Thank you, birth mother, for giving me the life I have. My mother has been fantastic and has treated me very well and I am SO grateful to both of you for my life."" It's an important moment for her and she wants everyone important to her to be involved. Telling her you can't go because you don't like the idea that there is another mother out there is pretty selfish and lacking in understanding of what it is your daughter is and will go through while meeting her biological mom.

My advice, suck up the insecurity and realize that this is absolutely not about you and being a bad mother or something but about your daughter learning more about her culture, history, family, and getting to see her at least *seven siblings*. You should want to experience this opportunity with her.

I used to be in charge of my company's disability program and one of the biggest things I had to know about was exactly how ADA worked in regards to service animals, especially because we had a lot of animals where I worked, so cross-contamination, aggressiveness, etc. came into play. It's easy to spot an animal that isn't an actual service animal because of a few things:  
1.) They're not a dog or a miniature horse.  
2.) The owner continuously lets people pet their animal. A service animal is doing a job and an owner of a legit service animal would VERY rarely let anyone pet their animal because they are on duty.  
3.) The animal constantly walks ahead, barks, acts like a pet instead of a trained animal. Service animals are trained to stay out of the way. Between legs, under chairs/tables, to walk by their owner's side, etc.  
4.) Hidden away in a stroller. Like...covered by a blanket and trying to pass them off as a baby as long as they're not currently barking kind of hidden in a stroller.

To figure out the distinction, an employee/business owner/etc. is allowed to ask 2 questions: ""Is this animal required because of a disability?"" and ""What work or task has the animal been trained to perform.""

Almost every person whose animal I had to turn away from the entrance shoved a card in my face that said their animal was a registered service animal. I got to tell them, ""ADA doesn't require a registration card. After our interaction today, I can tell that your animal is not a service animal and is therefore not allowed to enter. We have a kennel available by the parking lot."" And honestly, I never came across an owner with a true service animal who carried that card with them.

ADA has a nice little [FAQ](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html) that maybe OP can review with the friend to help guide in making sure the animal can get to service animal status."
AmItheAsshole,fe6c0c8,t1_fe5x691,1578886584.0,"That's kind of where the distinction between ESA and service animal comes into play. It could be you have a service animal for emotional support things. Like there are legitimate service animals for those with PTSD because they can sense when an attack is coming, know how to get help if anything is needed, etc. But if it's just an ESA like, ""I just feel calmer when this animal is around"" the public space legal protections just aren't there because no one knows how a random support animal is going to act compared to trained service animals who behave in a calm manner."

My mom doesn't always ask for grandchildren or anything but my stepmom does. Between my mother, the absolutely ridiculous person my dad dated between my mother and my stepmom, and the early days of living with my stepmom, I was always on the side of not having children because I never had a good example of a mother. I had angry, selfish, ridiculous, and manipulative women around me. The only good motherly example I had was my grandmother and she died of cancer about 3 years ago. There is one woman who graduated with my older sibling who's raised an amazing child and has recently had 2 more and seeing how she's raised her first child and currently raising the other two alongside, I've considered her a role model if I ever did end up becoming a mom.

I'm currently 6 months pregnant (and haven't told my birth mother because I mostly cut her off years ago) and while I'm terrified every day of being a bad mother because of the terrible and not-so-great role models I had growing up, I also have over a decade of experience being in supervisory and managerial roles to teams of up to 250 or so people. The groups of people who worked for me are years later still telling me I'm one of the best supervisors they've ever had and am who they compare other leaders to in jobs and careers they've gone into later. It's given me a confidence boost because I only became the leader I was after also having to deal terrible leadership mentors and learned exactly what I didn't want to be like. So I'm trying to apply that same process to being a mother: remembering the things my mother figures did that I think were absolutely wrong/toxic/manipulative/etc. and finding better ways to handle it and hoping that I turn out better than what I've always feared I would.

I'm absolutely not saying that you will change your mind or you should or anything like that. Just giving the experience of someone who has been in the same predicament and had told my family I wasn't sure I would ever have kids (never really explained the reason why because I didn't want to hurt my stepmom's feelings...but I would absolutely tell my birth mother), but I wasn't always super-confident in that decision, I just felt like that's where life was leading me so far. It's honestly whatever works best for you. You know what you want and she doesn't have to like it but it also doesn't mean you have to put up with the comments.

I visited Ireland last year and if you notice someone is approaching you faster than you're going, you're supposed to slow down and move to the outside of the lane to let them pass. It's basically always let the faster person go past you as soon as safely possible to avoid this kind of situation. Something I kind of wish existed in the US, but that would be asking a lot because a lot of people already hate following the majority of the road rules. Like slower traffic keeping right while on the highway or using turn signals to indicate lane switching, etc.

Other dude is still the AH and should've noticed that he didn't have the space to pass properly, so that's still obviously on him but I can understand the frustration and wanting to go around.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWVEAYh62kE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWVEAYh62kE) 

My bf used to complain about me taking longer showers (about 25 min) because I also have thick hair, it used to be curly (my hair has DRASTIC changes every 9 years or so, it's dumb), and because we had just started dating, I shaved all the gd time. Though, also, I didn't shower at his house often because his bathroom was disgusting. He lived with a roommate and it's like they'd never heard of shower cleaner...or not keeping the shower curtain bunched up on one end as to not create a bunch of mold and mildew. Or to leave the door open because they didn't have a vent so all the extra moisture created even more mold and mildew. They never cleaned the shower floor. I could go on. So the few times I *did* shower at his house, it was spent doing everything very carefully so it didn't contaminate myself with everything in the shower anyway.

Meanwhile, he had told me when complaining about the length of time I spent in the shower that he didn't even really wash his ankles/feet because he figured the soap that came of the rest of him would do the job. Other guys at work agreed with him on this. The ladies at work were just like, ""Gross! TF?"" Meanwhile, women are supposed to step out everyday looking like they were just airbrushed for a magazine with perfect hair, perfect skin, no hair except on their head/eyebrows, acne-free, practically pore-less, etc. but Aphrodite forbid it takes time to do that because apparently women are just made that way and that sh!t is just supposed to happen.

And I can say it's not easy to get over and the rage will be re-induced often; if you randomly see him in passing again, his car, people who look like him, when people ask about him, etc. Honestly, I don't know how long that anger takes to go away as it's been over a year since I had everything confirmed and confronted him about it and I think about the whole situation pretty regularly still and get annoyed again.

I only hope that you're able to do better than me and realize you're the better one in the situation and you're absolutely better off without the jackass. I wish you luck and all the best in the future!"

relationships,fbhyuu3,t3_edbk7w,1576885999.0,"My sister is 17 and goes through this. Every time she gets a new boyfriend, at 2 weeks, it's ""OMG I LOVE YOU"" and she gets really attached for about 3 months...and then something happens, they break up, and about a month or so later, she's with another guy that she ""LOVES SO MUCH.""

I only had one bf during high school and we dated for about a year and a half. Around 3 months, I felt the same way you did but he went to a different school, so we didn't see each other all that often and it kind of helped in a way. Two months after I was thinking, ""I don't think I'm feeling this,"" we actually realized we loved each other - like, a mutual understanding of the feeling coming up between us. Sometimes, there's just a lull in the relationship, that happens. But other times, it really is just that they're not someone you want to be with. It's a process of growing up, really, and learning how your tastes and feelings work.

Being honest is really your best option. Don't be rude about it, but just be honest about your feelings with the girl you're with."
