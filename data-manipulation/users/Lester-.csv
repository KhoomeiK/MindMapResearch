todayilearned,ffgsemy,t1_ffgs8d4,1579913855.0,Probably because of alarmist propaganda like what you just posted. Far more people die because of accidents involving fossil fuels than nuclear.

politics,ff94cac,t1_ff80yhn,1579704534.0,Literally every other developed nation on earth has faced the same challenges and has implemented universal healthcare.
politics,ff7u337,t1_ff7sjbu,1579658386.0,"Let me put it like this: in 1966 the United States was the world's preeminent super power. Botswana was one of the poorest countries in the world and newly independent. They only had 4 miles of paved road. In 2020, the leaders of the ""left""most party in the US tells its base that Medicare for All is a pipe dream, despite it being widely popular (60+% support). Botswana has universal healthcare. Can I tell you how this is possible? No, not really. Do I have a better plan than Obamacare? Definitely not, but I'm not the fucking president. But to tell me that I should be glad we knocked out one third of uninsured people is laughable. Its ridiculous that there are uninsured people at all, and part of the reason why that is comes down to the ineptitude of the Democrats.

Also, they have lost more than they won over the last 40 years. I specified 20 for a reason lol."
politics,ff7rsg3,t1_ff7pd30,1579656794.0,"You are right about the 2008 bailout, I was being dumb. That said, Obama vocally backed the bailout.

Democrats love to blame their inability to win an election on anything but themselves: the Supreme Court, Russian Hackers, Bernie Sanders. At some point, a pattern emerges which shows that the party just can't win. Clinton's total lack of a ground game in the midwest in 2016 was embarrassing. Winning the popular vote is literally worthless without winning an election.

The ACA is bad. I'm sorry that you feel so strongly about it."

politics,ff7i9wx,t1_ff7ft0f,1579650184.0,">What about the thousands of people in Iraq and Afghanistan that died as a result of broken promises from the dems? 

Democrats controlled the Senate, but voted 29 - 23 to authorize force in Iraq. Obama promised to get us out of Afghanistan by 2014. That didn't happen. He said that he would end the war in Iraq in 2010. That also didn't happen. Hillary Clinton pushed to send 40000 more troops to Afghanistan and keep troops in Iraq.

>What about when Obama sided with the banks over everyday people?

In 2008, when the sub prime mortgage market crashed, Obama sent 700 billion dollars in aid to some of the worst offenders.

> What about when the Dems lost to George Bush twice, and Donald Trump once despite both being wildly unpopular?

This is just inarguable lol

> What about when Democrats repeatedly approved bigger military budgets and reauthorized the Patriot Act? 

Democrats voted to extend the Patriot Act just this November. On December 17th, the Senate passed a bill 87-8 that increased military spending by 22 billion dollars. Only 4 Democrats voted against it.

>The Affordable Care Act was completely gutted by the time that it passed.

40 million Americans are still uninsured, so not so affordable I guess."

politics,ff79sq9,t1_ff7868x,1579644084.0,"Oh wow, that is a massive record! Maybe she should run for president. I'm sure people would love her. I don't see anything about her pushing for 40000 more troops in Afghanistan though? Or where she wanted military intervention in Libya without going through congress? Or arguing to keep troops in Iraq?  Surely, those were pretty big wins."

politics,ff78jac,t1_ff77n2u,1579643228.0,Democrats held the majority in the Senate (50 plus one independent who voted against war) for the Iraq vote. It passed 77-23. Democrats voted 29 - 21 in favor of military action.
politics,ff75vki,t1_ff757jj,1579641735.0,"It's only enlightened centrism if you think that there are only 3 possibilities: Republican, Democrat and center. As it turns out, I am not any of those things. I am a socialist. I never said that they were ""100% ineffectual"". They have had some success, but I am not going to back down that on the whole, the Democrats have been ineffective and have basically rolled over for whatever the Republicans want. 

That's not what whataboutism is you fucking idiot. I literally responded to that comment in the exact same way they responded to me.

Whataboutism is when you respond to an accusation with an accusation with addressing what you're accused of. ie; The USA accuses the USSR of silencing police dissidents and the USSR replies by asking ""what about how you treat black people?"".

Giving examples or counter examples to support an argument is literally the most basic rhetorical device."
