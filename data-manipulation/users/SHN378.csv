Although the world looks incredible and photo realistic from 10,000ft it won't be able to generate good details at ground level. 

If I understand the technology correctly; the AI went through the Bing satellite images and recognised objects to render in 3D (trees, cars, buildings) 

I wonder if that same technology and technique could be used with street view images to bring more detail at street level? 

But this map is something like 2PB. With all of the street data too, that would be massive."

Because that's the fucking point. The USA isn't even a clean place FFS. You have entire towns that haven't had clean water in years and bankrupt cities that can't afford to clean. You have millions of people that have the same level* of healthcare as people from those 3rd world countries (*none)  

All of that is irrelevant, because we are not talking about how people catch measles. We are talking about how to prevent it. I'll give you a clue. It's with vaccines."

World health organisation a good enough source? 6.2 million preventable deaths world wide in 2018 alone.

The article states that immunization would prevent a lot of deaths. Not all, as some of them are down to malnutrition."

Your link is trash. It literally says nothing. The gist of it, seems to be about the lack of evidence of vaccines causing autism and then there is a just a random quote from a antivaxxer that says it's all ""plausible"" with no further context or evidence. 

At best, the article has been written in a way that will fool stupid people. You included. If you take the Lyn Redwood quote and search her. You'll see that she's almost constantly proved wrong. 

What's more is that your argument about the pharmaceutical pay offs falls pretty flat in every other country. I'm from the UK. Land of free healthcare. Big pharma makes no where near as much from us as they do from your broken system. Do our vaccines cause autism too? If so, then what do you think they're gaining from it over here? 

You only need to look at the rise in preventable illness to see what harm your doing. Then again, your bullshit only works on the stupid and I guess you'll wipe your selves out pretty soon."
antivax,fel3wz4,t1_fejy862,1579213520.0,Yeah. That's a lot of words. Zero answered the only question I asked. Which isn't a suprise. You're just repeating the same shit as every other Antivax loon.
