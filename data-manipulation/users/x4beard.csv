I mean, it's stupid that they have a Robert E Lee day, but the way you described VA, at least it wasn't in response to MLK's holiday."

Over 95% of farms are family owned. These 95% of farms own over 80% of the farmland in the country.  

And to settle additional questions you may have, the majority of the family owned farms are small farms (< $250k gross annual income ). If you're anti-corporation, this should make you happy. I'm not sure why you're attacking me.

Finally, Walmart is a publicly traded corporation, it's not family owned. The Walton's own a slight majority of the stock, but that doesn't make it a family owned business. These phrases may not mean anything to you, but they have well defined meanings."
