Probably 30-35 years ago lawyers sued mental institutions, states, the federal government and anyone else they could think of on behalf of people institutionalized against their will.  Used to be if a parent or spouse said you were crazy they put you away indefinitely.  Those lawsuits led to the 72 hour hold but only if you are a danger to yourself or others.  So the mentally ill ended up being put out of institutions and many became homeless.  A subset of those break the law and end up in prison.  Lots of the federal inmates have done nothing more than threaten the president or another politician.  That's an automatic sentence behind bars. But they do try to treat them.  The federal prison I worked in spent millions on psych meds and if inmates didn't take them they were put in solitary.  So 99% took them.

AskReddit,fcjtr1x,t1_fciph9h,1577704285.0,This one is new.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcjtoci,t1_fcjg9jj,1577704176.0,That is a separate part of the problem. Private prisons would love for any crime to have a mandatory minimum.  Look at the case of the judge bribed to send youth offenders to the juvenile facility in Pennsylvania.  Didn't matter the crime.  But police funding is often driven by the war on crime.  Asset forfeiture is the big cash cow though. Most places you just have to be charged.  There are lots of examples of wealthy business people being charged simply so the police could steal their assets. It is a nation wide problem.  Drugs scare people so that is their red herring at election time.  https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/asset-forfeiture-abuse
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcjti0w,t1_fcjd67l,1577703918.0,"That's the post conviction side.  There is money there in sex crimes too.  But the police lobby has worked very hard to keep all drug crimes on the books and to never allow asset forfeiture to be repealed either. Why do you think there is such tenacious resistance to state marijuana laws?  They don't want the states to get the tax money, they want to keep taking the cash and sports cars from drug dealers. https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/crime/article/Texas-police-department-awarded-Corvette-from-6524250.php"
bigboye,fcj7xxk,t3_eha477,1577679532.0,"I read an article about grizzlies online, many years ago.  A guy was going hunting on an island in Alaska so he got a grizzly permit just in case.  I think he was looking for caribou.  Anyway he shot a bear and took pictures of the paws against his chest and they were nearly equal. It wasn't the record but I think it was very large nonetheless.  They are formidable creatures."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcj56hy,t1_fcj4wnd,1577677542.0,"I definitely agree.  The damage from trafficking is untold and it is a world wide problem.  That being said, there is actually an argument for decriminalizing sex work among women who do it voluntarily.  Australia has seen many positive results since they legalized prostitution. Less disease, pimps are gone, trafficking is down.  It won't happen in the US for another 50 years unfortunately. All of Trumps supporters will need to be dead."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcj4dfo,t1_fcizn8g,1577676976.0,"These girls may have completely refused to cooperate, given their one illegal behaviors.  This prosecution may have been completely motivated by parents and a district attorney that wanted an easy conviction or political capital. I knew a singer when I lived in Nashville years ago who slept with a couple of 17 year old groupies.  Very willing partners.  But one of the Moms found out and coerced her ""innocent"" daughter into testifying after the Mom demanded charges be brought.  This guy did 5 years in prison, Tennessee after all and 1980s, for not being able to tell a 17 year old from an 18 year old while he had a hard dick.  Just food for thought.  If you read the article this guy wasn't sneaking in houses and raping virgins."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcj42xw,t1_fcj3dr1,1577676765.0,"You forget there is money in the ""war on drugs"". Asset forfeiture is one of the main sources of law enforcement revenue in some jurisdictions. There is no money in the war on sex."
