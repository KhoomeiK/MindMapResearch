NoStupidQuestions,ff31ta9,t3_er1vm8,1579531439.0,"If my family/friend REALLY needed me they'd call me more than once, or at least leave a message, but realistically, they know if they need me, that they should text me and ill get back to them immediately. The moment anyone in north America picks up a spam call, even if it connects for just a couple seconds, we get put back into a list that marks the number as active, gets sold off back to more spammers/phishers.

This means more spam calls, more targeted phishing/malware texts from people posing as your bank, government agency like a courthouse or some other important figure to steal information from you. 

I was recently a victim of identity theft and bank fraud, we couldn't catch the person, but at least I was quick enough to react to my stuff shutting down that I got it all cancelled and my accounts back in order before anything terrible could happen. At one point, less than three months ago for about 7 weeks straight I was receiving spam calls from out of country numbers every single hour consecutively in a 24 hour period during that time, gets annoying when you're at work and you think it could be important, or trying to sleep and think its a friend in trouble etc. Then there's also the calls that try to charge you hundreds of dollars for every minute spent on the line and run your phone bill up at the end of a month.

In short, just don't answer your personal phone these days. Wait for a message in your inbox or a text. If you're concerned about job offers, they'll still leave a message if they truly need help, to which you know the number is now sage and could call them back immediately after the left message, or they'll even email you if you can't be reached by phone as long as that was provided. As long as you don't answer your phone to unknown numbers, you'll save yourself lots of time, and money."

MonsterHunterWorld,fcu30lq,t3_eixlwu,1577971009.0,"Play how you want, there is no set builds, until arch tempered(lvl 50+ HR quests) where you pretty much need armor/trait specific stuff, you can use whatever you want, 

Typically people build +3tier health boost, combined with strongest cooked meal, at full health unless you wear armor specific things with a bad defence rating vs what you're fighting (full behemoth for example gives nice critical stats and decent attack, decent armor against all attacks except for dragon being -18, so xenojivs beam  for example would basically one shot you no matter how much hp you have. A good hunter has more than one set to fight different monsters at higher levels typically, unless you focus on just pure attack/defence/hp/critical and use whatever else to fill in the gaps.

I'll tell you my favourites, I use insect glaive and I have two styles, one is essentially critical focused, so I have higher affinity set into it to increase crit chances, (my armor halves sharpness loss on critical hits with its lvl 2 tier effect (4 armor pieces set) , so the more criticals, the less weapon sharpening I need to do combined with razor blade, halves sharpness loss in general (except for long arch tempered quests which I'd only have to sharpen one time all game) I'd never have to sharpen from blue sharpness back to white level, it just stays white. (higher sharpness value means more base damage), has max health boost, and then a bunch of stuff to help me evade, evade extender, evade window, critical status (so whenever I'm on fire, poisoned, etc, I use less stamina doing evades to get away from the situation without having to worry about my stamina while being targeted, and some attack point boosts in there, anywhere between lvl4-7 attack is fine depending on what charm you want to use.

With all my evasion stuff and critical, allows me to close the gap further to get those hits in on the beasts, nonstop attacking with very little white tier sharpness loss, and keep my dps high. With high hp to take a couple strong hits befor I am to go down.

My other build is more for mounting creatures, and I put a focus of teamwork into this build. Stamina action reduction helps too. Max wide range, so as long as people are in view (not off screen on the mini-map) they get all the buffs and heals at full effect from me, with speed eater to speed it up just a little, give everyone heals if a team gets hit and everyone low hp, double the heals for other players if they also potion up, attack boosts and defence as well, astera jerky for gradual healing or if everyone lost a huge hp chunk simultaneously. Has +3 stamina cap boost, and +1 stamina recovery which allows me to stay airborne and be a helicopter with my insect glaive for 4 sets of attacks befor I need to land on the ground to recover. 

every action in the air consumes stamina, but timing with regen makes me nearly able to infinetly stay in the air as long as I can hit a target to continue the chain, you can hit a monster up to 7 times as you spin in the air with weapon in one attack, moving around, between each attack, you can use 1 evade to cover distance  to get closer or flee if you see a strong attack coming and need to get out of the way, as long as the last hit of the attack hits the target (the first 6 ticks of damage don't matter, you can miss as long as the last one hits). In one set, you can leap up to become airborne, evade in a direction to get closer/flee, attack, which closes more distance again, evade again, attack again, evade again and attack again(4th airborne attack in a row will always land the character) but with high stamina+regen, I can instantly do all that two-three more times befor I need to stop and recover my stamina again.

Airborne attacks allow mounts to be possible (without using the claw from icebourne) so more time spent in the air hitting the target means more mounting chances where I can either down the flying creature, or just let my teammates smack it for dps as I just chill on it using stamina to keep it in one spot rather than downing it (with all my stamina, I'll watch my bar, as the creature gets stunned and stops ill look at my stamina bar and decide whether I should down it or just stay on top longer and go another rodeo round (up to 3 times depending on the monster) to let my teammates continue doing whatever they have to do with little worries about the beast attacking them, every mount is basically a success, even an arch tempered teo/Luna stands no chance against my mounts. I use the downed time to either sharpen my weapon, place some bombs on target or recover everyone's hp/stamina/buffs again. And then I'm back to airborne dps again, rinse repeat."
