Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ff7dcsq,t1_ff7cq3q,1579646938.0,A Reddit newbie I see.  It is no good posting actual facts round here.
AmItheAsshole,ff6pogg,t1_ff6hlmn,1579632274.0,Grow up and try living in the real world rather than your naive fantasy  realm.  He who pays the Piper calls the tune.
AmItheAsshole,ff6ghhx,t3_erxl53,1579626683.0,YTA - if you want to control your wedding then you pay for it all.  If someone else is paying then they get a significant say.
ukpolitics,ff6g9ti,t3_erxljb,1579626551.0,But that is one of the reasons you lost.  If you can not see that just ignoring reality has not worked well so far why do you think doubling down on it will work next time comrade?
UKInvesting,ff69sug,t3_erk8d5,1579622468.0,If you want diversification or a geographic or industry specialisation buy an ETF but if you want a particular company just buy their actual shares.  So if you want high exposure to Google then just buy Alphabet shares directly.
clevercomebacks,feer79z,t1_feem7iy,1579039476.0,What we think of as rights should not be set in stone 200+ years ago never ever to change.  That is flawed.  That is stupid.  That has lead to many many problems.
clevercomebacks,feeiyqv,t1_feefc55,1579034702.0,Yes as times change.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fdw5nee,t1_fdup1om,1578755343.0,No he will lose his job but the paper can not 2nd guess the disciplinary hearing by saying so in advance.
clevercomebacks,fdp22e5,t1_fdp1hf0,1578618146.0,Grow up.
clevercomebacks,fdobe4m,t1_fdo8ljs,1578602134.0,Grow the fuck up.  What is and is not a right has changed multiple times.
chemistry,fdo39hp,t1_fdnqgte,1578598091.0,I really do not see it as very much use at all even for that.  There is just too much complexity for this to work for anything other than the simples salts and they are trivial to work out anyway.
clevercomebacks,fdmyv30,t1_fdmxfcy,1578571777.0,"Yeah maybe; they can of course be added and then rescinded.  These ""amendments"" as you call them would not have to last for ever and ever even if they did seem like a great idea say 228 years ago.  I'm not sure about you but 228 years seem like quite a long time ago and maybe the people then could not have imagined a fraction of what the world looks like now."
AmItheAsshole,fdmx4st,t3_em8ert,1578569796.0,NTA - they asked a question you gave an answer.  If they expected you to say the US was perfect they should not have asked what you did not like.
CasualUK,fdmx1z0,t3_em8e9b,1578569700.0,No mine has it in the kitchen with eggs in it - as it was designed for.
clevercomebacks,fdmwxw0,t3_em7xkz,1578569561.0,"There are some places in the world who update their laws from time to time so they do not get out of date, just a thought."
chemhelp,fdmvkut,t3_em58fh,1578567848.0,75L of bromine is a lot to measure in grams.  I think the teacher has fucked up and assumed bromine gas but at STP bromine is a liquid with a density of 3.1g/ml.
chemistry,fdmuwse,t3_em5ifk,1578566958.0,What use would this app really be?
chemistry,fdgsnxg,t1_fdgcvob,1578407307.0,Or entirely right.  There are a lot more elements needed for even simple life.
facepalm,fde20qg,t3_ekvdc9,1578329399.0,What an idiot everyone knows American cars corner like boats.
ukpolitics,fdbpu4c,t1_fdbpkpd,1578260026.0,Exactly this and the last paragraph of this article really hits the nail on the head; most European nations have a better healthcare system than the UK for not a lot more money.  We should copy the best parts of their systems and ignore completely the US model.
Foodforthought,fcqw97g,t1_fcjkp5i,1577893166.0,Yes.  Most of Reddit are very left wing very young and very naive.  Once they grow up they might realise what insufferable tools they once were but I doubt most will grow up enough.
WTF,fcj1q7v,t1_fcj0cr3,1577675095.0,"I'll take all your money as I'm 50.  
  
You are right I do not understand American gun culture because it makes no sense to anyone other than a few Americans.  Why is your desire for a gun so important?    
A single shot bolt action hunting rifle I can understand.  A hunting rifle with a small magazine, OK.  An AR15 or similar no.  A hand gun of any kind no.  The only things those are good for is killing people.  Open carry or having your gun easily accessible in your vehicle or home no.  Why can you not understand that it the norm for the developed world.  Why do Americans want to match third world countries?"
WTF,fciz6rn,t1_fciyrym,1577673348.0,I would bet a lot of money that I am older than you but you are right I do not live in the US so I am not so blinkered by abject fucking insanity to think mass gun ownership is a good thing and that nothing can or should be done to change it.
WTF,fcixv6t,t1_fcix3zz,1577672431.0,Yes a poll is less accurate than asking everyone so why not ask everyone a binary question and then go with the majority answer?
WTF,fcixkkp,t1_fcixby3,1577672225.0,The answer to a problem with guns is not more guns.  If you can not grasp the simple concept that gun violence can only be solved by fewer guns you are lost.
WTF,fciwri9,t1_fciwl8l,1577671671.0,Sure polls are always wrong when you disagree with the outcome.
WTF,fciw7b1,t1_fcivk4d,1577671285.0,Yes I agree but polls suggest stronger gun control laws are wanted by the majority of Americans but the vocal minority win out and the gun deaths continue.
WTF,fciw07f,t1_fcivmo9,1577671149.0,The state killing someone after the crime does not stop the crime.  Can you show me any facts that dispute what I said?
clevercomebacks,fcivsbt,t1_fcivd6g,1577670999.0,Did those guns start out as illegal or were they originally made and sold legally?
WTF,fcivg0p,t1_fciuxen,1577670770.0,So what?  If the constitution was perfect it would not have needed any amendments but it has had a few dozen and they can themselves be amended later.  Other countries had laws than needed changing as situations changed.  What makes the US so different?
WTF,fciuklk,t1_fciu7be,1577670166.0,Countries where guns are highly restricted or illegal have much fewer deaths than in the USA but obviously those things are not connected at all and so America should carry on doing nothing about gun violence.
WTF,fcitxav,t1_fcitbpk,1577669725.0,Most of the civilised world at least tries it first rather than just pretending nothing can be done.
clevercomebacks,fcithg1,t3_ehew7e,1577669423.0,"Only one country in the world thinks that the problem of gun violence can be ""solved"" by more guns."
politics,fcintm2,t1_fchfywy,1577665735.0,In what fucking universe is the Corbyn led Labour Party centre-left?
Foodforthought,fcimugj,t3_ehbcba,1577665210.0,"From the UK this article reads like the pathetic ramblings of a fool who can not grasp they are the one out of step and instead insist everyone else is wrong and stupid.  
Edit: and judged by my downvotes reddit is also out of step."
AmItheAsshole,fcikhsi,t1_fcii3bw,1577664078.0,"So 100 years and 5 generations and you think of yourself as German-American?  That just does not make any sense to me at all.
EDIT: what things do you and your family do that you feel are German?"
AmItheAsshole,fcihn9x,t1_fcifwem,1577662700.0,For you with dual citizenship that hyphenated designation is accurate but for most Americans it is not.  Less than 10% of the US population is entitled to dual citizenship.  If you can only hold a US passport you are 100% American.
AmItheAsshole,fcif0sc,t1_fcia5i8,1577661553.0,"Yes, you get it.   Worse is some black guy from London whose grandparents came over from the Caribbean in the 1950's who'll get told he's African-American."
AmItheAsshole,fcidc05,t1_fchl9p5,1577660856.0,As a matter of interest how many generations do you need to go back in your family until a direct relation was born and grew up in Germany?
insanepeoplefacebook,fciblip,t3_ehcp2c,1577660166.0,"Yeah moving mass shooting into church means the useless ""thoughts and prayers"" can start imediately.  Problem solved,"
AmItheAsshole,fci8274,t1_fci4jue,1577658858.0,"So you are American but your parents were not.
EDIT:  why downvote a factually correct answer?"
AmItheAsshole,fci5pol,t1_fci14jr,1577658074.0,I would guess that there is much much more in commen between your family and another American family with Scottish heritage there there is with actual German or Scottish families.  The German and Scottish familes would both view you as American and far removed from their European views.  If those German or Scottish families moved to each others counties they would still consider themsleves German or Scottish beacause that is where they were born but if they then had children they would be the opposite because of where they were born.  As a matter of interest how many generations do you need to go back in your family until a direct relation was born and grew up in Germany?
AmItheAsshole,fch77dh,t3_eh9yjm,1577647893.0,"ESH   
SIL is not Italian she is American.    
You're not German you are American.
If you were born and live in America you are just an American.  Stop focussing on where your distant ancestors came from and grow up."
chemistry,fcf1wpp,t1_fce64k7,1577625901.0,Dilute it and see if it is still red.
chemistry,fcdwcdm,t3_eh30a6,1577614490.0,Is a solution of it red or yellow?  Does it dye fabric/paper red or yellow?
Foodforthought,fbxznm6,t1_fbxsx17,1577204558.0,3 week's holiday is still low compared to other 1st world countries.  Too often I see the US compare itself to the third world and pat itself on the back rather than look at other advanced countries where the comparisons do not look so good.
explainlikeimfive,fbddjdv,t3_ecsgbt,1576758564.0,"I do not hate her but do find her strident denunciations very childish.  Which is slightly forgivable given she is a child but not completely because she has been given a platform worldwide.  Yes climate change is a real problem, yes we need to do more about it, yes some countries are really not doing very much but do not make out that the world will end tomorrow.  Humanity has been very good at averting crisis after crisis by scientific and commercial advancements.  I see no reason to expect climate change will not be dealt with in the same way."
