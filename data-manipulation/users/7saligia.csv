Many years and a kid later, this came back to screw with me. The kiddo enjoyed running around outside. There was a wooded section behind our back fence, and we ran into snakes, spiders, raccoons, lizards, chiggers, and whatever other wildlife wanted to invade. 

One day, I spotted a tick on the kiddo after he had been playing outside. Instant anxiety, and we immediately tried to remove it but that bloodsucker was latched in and would not move. It did not matter what method we tried, it wasn't going anywhere. Any method you've heard of, we probably tried it. Yet it would. not. budge. It was hunkered down and enjoying the opportunity to gorge on this young snack. But still we persisted. 

What seemed like any eternity later, we decided that we should take the kiddo to the medical professionals. Surely they would be able to deburrow that frakker. But first, his father wanted another look at it. He despises spiders and always let me take care of them. He decided that a tick was close enough to a spider that he did not want anything to do with it. As such, until this point, he had only glanced at it in the beginning and then just observed my failed attempts to evict the bugger.

JustBootThings,fdcazc4,t3_ekguvu,1578270661.0,"This happened at my son's graduation. It was a tad warm, and I remember thinking that it had to suck for them to be standing there in formation as long as they were before the ceremonies even started. Guy was wobbling, and my son reported that they repeatedly instructed the kid not to lock his knees. They allowed him to take a knee pre-ceremonies; he seemed to recoup and be doing better--only to drop on the parade deck later. They handled it fairly smoothly and most of the attendees didn't seem to notice."

FTR, he was a kid himself at the time, and I'm fairly certain that the TV show was purely coincidental and likely left on by another sibling. Still some disturbing imagery that seared itself into my brain as I quickly backed out of that room."

funny,fc1ieu0,t3_efnzra,1577319708.0,"We had an ugly Christmas sweater day at work last week. A director wore a sweater with two snowmen on it because she likes snowmen. 

Both snowmen's carrot noses were right at tit level and nipple position. One slightly lower than the other. Carrots were a tad saggy. (Hey, it happens as we get older; no judgment!)

She ended up wearing a sweater over her sweater, but it was too late. People had already heard about it and kept coming by to check it out (& give her grief)."
