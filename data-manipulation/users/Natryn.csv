Portland,fffxngf,t1_fffwq12,1579894048.0,Damn I can't even imagine spending $200 a day on anything...
Portland,fffw0nr,t1_fffpvby,1579893026.0,$1300 of smack in a week?  How much do you think a banana costs?
Portland,fffvdw0,t1_fffljvy,1579892626.0,"I'm using the words ""free money"" to mean giving someone money in exchange for nothing.  You could also give someone money to work an artificially created and unnecessary job, like a cashier that is replacing a machine.  Either way the person needs  an income to survive."
singing,fffugc1,t3_etds41,1579892044.0,"I think there's a time for praise and a time for tough critique.  I don't think telling a talented person to aim higher and telling a young insecure person they're doing a good job are necessarily conflicting ideas.    


He could just be playing the crowd and being tough on talented people to seem like more authoritative though.  I have noticed he's especially kind and supportive to women he's attracted to vs. others.  Also I've always found it strange for a non-singer to critique singing talent."
Portland,fffk0b1,t3_etch02,1579885617.0,"When you tie survivial to jobs, these are the kind of solutions that are required to sustain employment numbers.  Either some people get free money to survive or we come up with stupid jobs and stupid rules to keep the stupid jobs."
Portland,ffb1k6c,t1_ffazmed,1579749491.0,It recently became a federal crime.
media_criticism,ff7v14j,t1_ff7ubzm,1579659023.0,I read the article and also don't see a basic implication that all trump voters are racist.  Also I'm pretty sure this is an op-ed.
todayilearned,ff5mx5w,t1_ff4f85g,1579600916.0,Have you seen someone hanged? Or seen someone see someone hanged?
Portland,fej5wqf,t1_feiz9q2,1579158181.0,"I think the idea is to invest it, and inflation lowers the worth of the money as well.  30 years ago.  There are over 2,000 billionaires today.  30 years ago there were less than 100."

vancouverwa,fcoz6eo,t1_fcoy5r8,1577845656.0,True but not the case if there were spots available...
todayilearned,fcb11w9,t1_fc8f64l,1577580597.0,Fox is a good example of bad people
todayilearned,fcb0ew1,t1_fc90szb,1577580200.0,"His whole thing was that everyone is worthy of love and admiration because we're all special ""just the way we are"".  His gift was showing others they had something to give too;  That they were and always would be valuable.  I don't appreciate him because  he was perfect, I appreciate him because of his awe inspiring love and compassion for others.  His goodness never felt fake, like it was something you just had to do.  He just really genuinely cared about everyone, even strangers.  I feel like sometimes we can forget that's possible and that's why I value him."
todayilearned,fc8bs9h,t1_fc89k9d,1577531359.0,Mr. Rogers - The American Buddha
todayilearned,fc88ql6,t1_fc7y8t5,1577529407.0,"He was the only person I'd still consider flawless human being.  He seemed to have a very deep and genuine interest in the well being of others, especially children.  He had a TV show years ago called ""Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"".  He taught children how to handle difficult feelings and self acceptance and appreciation with compassion and was never condescending and always kind.  While he disagreed with violence and negativity, he never preached to anyone, and always spoke from a perspective of pure empathy and understanding towards others.  I've never read a single bad thing about him."
thanksimcured,fc83h44,t1_fc82r8z,1577525967.0,Debt isn't always avoidable.  What was illegal about the advice?
