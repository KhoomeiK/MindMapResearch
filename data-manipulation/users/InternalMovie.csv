AskReddit,ffon1tl,t3_eu6iol,1580079388.0,"Okay so when I was about 12 I think- I was in 7th grade around 2002-2003 and my art teacher had on the wall a picture called ""the geisha and the maid"" was a ukiyo-e style print and I was like to myself ""what's a geisha?"" So I think I forgot for a few weeks to look it up but at some point I did. And I typed in Geisha and all is well saw lots of gorgeous photos of what I would later find out to be maiko (apprentice geisha) and so on- and I found a really great website and that website had links and sources to other great websites except one. When I got to that link and I kind of remember the URL name something like hardcoregeisha or something, and being 12 years old and naive I clicked on it and incomes a plethora of stuff a 12 year old girl should not see. I still don't know why that link was there on a really credible website."

AskMen,ffh9ybt,t3_etcmuk,1579927424.0,"Supernatural. It got a bit ""too breathy"" for me. If an episode didn't end mid fight or mid reveal- then it always ended with the brothers having an argument of ""no Dean you're wrong!"" or ""listen to me Sammy""  and although I LOVE the supernatural genre- ghosts/demons/witches/werewolves etc- the show SPN got a bit silly for me the older I became. The first time I saw supernatural I was 16 and season 1 had just ended and 2 was just starting up. and I was like- upon seeing Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki for the first time I said to myself ""No way do people get born that way- no one is that naturally good looking. It's impossible."" and i was hooked. and then I liked the ghosts and monsters and all that and played a game called Until Dawn simply because it made me think of SPN- and I couldn't help it but any time I watched a demonic possession movie or ghost movie me and my sister would joke ""This movie would be over in 30 minutes if they called the Winchesters"" and its still funny to say -  But overtime I found myself wanting something a bit spookier, darker with more punishing results. and it sort of went that way sometimes- but I got really disinterested around season 5."
AskReddit,ffh8t73,t3_etdal4,1579926408.0,"I didn't date one but I am good friends with an ex high fashion model- not super famous but definitely more famous than me or anyone we know.  she was and still is my best friend since we were 12. we were born just days apart and she's basically like a sister to me. She is super gorgeous. We went to middle school together and even though I moved away, we remained very close and often met up. She did some modeling for clothing catalogs and went to talent agents. She continued this for a few years and eventually got noticed by a modeling agency and got signed on with a brand.  She made lots of fucking money. She did however choose to quit due to stress/eating disorder and hair loss.  She now teaches dance to girls and is doing wonderfully.

Also went to HS with a guy who was drafted into the NFL. From what I remember he was a really nice and swell guy to everyone including an awkward fumbling girl like myself. I was a freshman and he was a senior. He was on the winning team in superbowl 50."
AskReddit,ffh4u9i,t3_et8871,1579923152.0,"Unicorns and mermaids! Because the lore behind them is pretty rad to me. Unicorns represent something different all around the world. They're small horse-like creatures - not originally nor exactly horses as modern society makes them out to be but, smaller like a deer or a large goat, cloven hooves and boar like tails generally. Typically good luck- sometimes they mean death and horror. Also: Mermaids! I love mermaids but they're often mixed up with Sirens. They're not the same thing though. just as Police cars and Fire trucks are not the same thing. Atargatis/Ataratheh was the first mermaid, and was basically the Syrian Aphrodite. Sirens did not have fish tails or scales, and were 3 cursed women with bird bodies and a woman's upper torso. their names were Peisinoe, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia. They were Persephone's hand maidens- punished by Demeter for not protecting her daughter from Hades. Their songs sounded sweet as they offered you your greatest desire but mainstream media narrows it down to 'sex' only.  Anyone who was in earshot of the songs would end up either dead or involved in a catastrophe women and children included. Mermaids, were a good omen though- not murderous 'mermaids'. myths  go back telling how they saved sailors and unfortunate people lost at sea, and they would reward you with treasure usually if you proved to be a good person. My favorite - 2nd to the unicorn book I always rented in Middle school was a book only about mermaids. I think the book was called ""Mermaid tails from around the world"" And the unicorn book was similar and i think had a Michael Hague style unicorn on the cover and featured all different kinds of unicorn stories and origins but i don't recall the name."
AskReddit,ffh0wbs,t3_etbrdf,1579920135.0,"In the late 80's and until about 1999, My mother had a Siamese cat named Fred. Absolutely gorgeous and sweet cat. Whenever he was vexed at her, he would dig through my parents dirty laundry and pile all her stuff up away from my fathers and shit on only her things. She took him to the vet repeatedly and tests were run, but he was completely healthy. Just a bit of a prick to my mother whenever the dog sat in his spot. (he was trained to only sit on a dark blue or black towel)."

I'm 5ft- so the majority of men are taller than me. Idm a guy who's closer to my height tbh. But I'm not going to ""talk down to"" him just because hes 5ft 3, and as long as we can see ""eye to eye"" and get along great then I see no issue."
