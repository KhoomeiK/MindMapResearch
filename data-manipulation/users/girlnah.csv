I've made it a point to drop these kind of people from my circle. Hard stop. Dont value my time? Cool. Peace. Then when they ask why I ghosted, I dont answer. 

You are kind, that is why you are second guessing yourself. Plus, losing what we feel are friends to us can be a bit heartbreaking.  Like a loss. But now you have space and time for people who value you, your time, and the booze you'll bring is the extra incentive!

I would 1000 percent invite you to my place if you are close to San Diego! Fuck it! Let's make new friends in 2020. 

Happy New Year and MUCH LOVE TO YOU!"
SuicideWatch,fc76c05,t3_egk9ca,1577498722.0,Thank you both. This is always a tough part of the year to navigate through.
creepyencounters,fc4jjja,t3_efytgq,1577418511.0,This had my full attention the entire time. OMG. I am glad you are okay. I am also glad that you have realized a part of yourself that is not healthy for you. I am in the same place. Good luck to you (and I love your writing style. Amazing).
SuicideWatch,fc403cg,t3_efyji7,1577403105.0,I'd love to talk.
SuicideWatch,fc3zlkj,t3_eg0l39,1577402732.0,I can relate.  I am having these feelings today.
confessions,fb5ogus,t1_fb5lj1y,1576531428.0,This is actually what I needed to read. Thank you. Thank you. It has become such a distraction for me. I loved that girl man. But it's time for a change.
