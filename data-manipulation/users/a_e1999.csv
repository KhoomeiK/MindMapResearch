fatlogic,fexjwbe,t3_eqob2b,1579432182.0,I don't know what's worse.... That it can cause you panic attacks or that your OWN gym gear can trigger you.....

Pretty hard if you have panic attacks the moment you step out and see the sun. This is genius. 
But thanks I think I'm cured"
fatlogic,fcaxa6n,t1_fcawg8z,1577578440.0,I somehow understand what you mean but I think saying what's healthy and whats not is just a description of food. Just like saying too much sugar is unhealthy. And if you look at a normal pizza you can buy at a restaurant it's unhealthy because of the amount of fat it has.
fatlogic,fbgps4x,t1_fbgd7x5,1576855749.0,Omg this is exactly what they always want. Being a fat person not wanting a fat person but crying like a bitch because the non fat person doesn't want to date fat people. The irony. The controversy.
