KidsAreFuckingStupid,ffdn39o,t3_esyocl,1579824393.0,"My little brother did worse. He poured out a whole tub of baby powder on my moms bed. And then proceeded to jump on the bed.

My mom yelled for me to come upstairs. And then opened the door and my brother was just sitting on a bed in a room coated in baby powder.

My mom couldn't help but laugh because when she opened the door i guess she just gasped and he said. ""It's okay mom, it's okay"""

confession,ff49rw3,t3_erc2dd,1579558644.0,"The truth is, you don't deserve to have him in your life, you could have ruined his. You were old enough to know better, but kids do very stupid things sometimes so hopefully you can learn to forgive yourself.

You should apologize. In writing, but I wouldn't expect a response.

After the first time you threatened him he probably never wanted to see you again, but was likely terrified you were going to ruin his life."

datingoverthirty,feu60w6,t3_eqjop6,1579383418.0,"I just have a question about where do you draw the line.

I hardly ever drink. But when I do...it's to get wasted. It might be 1ce every few months. I'm just curious if that would be acceptable to you, or if you only want someone who has a single glass of wine. 

You perfer sober which is fine. My friend who really likes to drink has a girlfriend that doesn't drink at all and it hasn't seemed to cause issues. She will volunteer to DD and it doesn't bother her that he drinks. But you sound like your very judgemental about it. And that's where your going to have problems because even if they don't care that you don't drink, if they feel judged they won't like being around you."

EngineeringPorn,fej16tn,t1_feis0gy,1579153208.0,I'm a machinist. And you would be surprised how easy some software makes things. The truth is the trade has become less skilled over time as technology gets better. And I say that as a 30 year old.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fehw1cx,t3_ep492k,1579124995.0,"I understand that some people get upset when it's suggested that rapists and pedophiles that get raped in prison get what they deserve. But this video is what makes me feel like it really is how those crimes should be punished.

Locking this guy up doesn't do anyone any good.

Monsters like this needs to feel fear...helpless. He needs to be put in a room with 1 or 2 guys that are 6'3"" 250lbs, that throw him around like a child beat him up, spit on him. Make him feel afraid and helpless for every last second of his worthless life.  Just like his daughter and that dog have for years.

This loser doesn't deserve a grave. Put is body in the dump.

That's justice."

happy,fc93j9k,t1_fc9291m,1577546443.0,"Man, relationships aren't built on power. 

She's timid because her brother is also my best friend. Her mom calls me her second son. And our friendship means the world to both of us. There's a lot on the line.

She's absolutely gorgeous. Out of my league and the reality is she can have anyone she wants. She's choosing to date me. What more could I want?"
happy,fc92sk6,t1_fc8hjga,1577546105.0,Completely agree! Me and her have talked about it in the past. Communication is key in everything!

When we had the conversation in the past she said, there's so much pressure on us to make this work that it has too, and I'm just not ready. It's something that has lingered for years and now I guess we are ready."

Me and her are the same person lol"
happy,fc8s9v7,t1_fc8iuuy,1577541068.0,"Well what I think you should do is use that time to work on yourself! I'm almost 30 now, but from 17-22 I suffered from depression. Then I started taking medication and still do, but it has improved my life so much.

The reason I say that is in my experience dealing with depression is that it is so exhausting and takes so much out of you that you have nothing left to give. I screwed up a great relationship because of that. 

Things do get better. Like I said its something I've battled for 12 years now. And I've hit the bottom many times. And there are still tough days. But the truth is the only person who can get you where you need to be is you. It's okay to lean on someone on those hard days."
happy,fc8r5xn,t1_fc8ikav,1577540507.0,"DON'T DO THAT! 
I mean I'm no expert, but I was in the same position and she didn't feel the same.

She knew I wanted to be together. But we talked and I had just said that I needed to put some space between us because it wasn't fair to her and it wasn't good for me.

The truth is she means the world to me as a friend. And I wasn't willing to give that up either. Give yourself as much space as you need to get yourself in a position where you are okay being friends. And if your lucky she may realize she doesn't like that space. And if it doesn't go that way hopefully you saved your friendship."

happy,fc7jzwj,t1_fc7ivdq,1577509870.0,Dude honestly it's much more difficult of a situation than just friends. So we have to keep it quiet for a little. I just had to get it out had to tell someone.
datingoverthirty,fc689t5,t1_fc5ry5k,1577474559.0,"Well to be honest I'm usually just swiping quick. And I'm judging them by their first picture. So if we match and I swipe through their pictures and that first picture is misleading, which a lot of times they are. That's when I realize I'm not attracted to them, or if they have certain things in their ""about me"" part that throw up instant red flags. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I've only invested seconds into them, until we match.

But admittedly I don't date much. I get a good amount of matches but I just usually find it's not worth the trouble/dissapointment when I don't have any luck with the girls I'm messaging."
datingoverthirty,fc5n4er,t3_egbp1y,1577461902.0,"Guy here. So I love when girls message me! It happens from time to time. But if I'm being honest, 80% of the time I don't reply.

I match with a lot of people I wouldn't date. And I assume I match with a lot of woman that wouldn't date me.  I really don't put much thought into it before we match and swipe pretty casually and get picker once I have matches.

Keep doing it! Eventually you'll message the right guy."
