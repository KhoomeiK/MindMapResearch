Past posts on him here report he's also accused of using this display to try to lure children into his house where he says there are more decorations, and neighbor children accused him of molestation too (which all jives with the court docs). 

It seems THAT was the catalyst for the neighbors to finally ask him to take reign in the display. Not even take it down, just adhere to some safety guidelines. 

In response he immediately started shining spotlights into these neighbors' houses and saying he could see their daughters naked with it.  Making signs with neighbors children's names on them. And all these profane signs.

...Oh and he lives right across from a Christian elementary school.

That house is also packed with guns per police reports (which show there's mean behind his sign threat of bloodshed). And he's got an record of no less than 4 arrests. One of those arrests for his refusal to pay child support for the children he's accused of abusing IS what kicked off all his aggression. He's been fixating on causing chaos ever since.

Congrats you picked the wrong day to try me and frankly it's a very touchy subject for me of late given that we're closing in on the 20th anniversary within the next 2 years soooo, let me tell you-

I was fucking right in the midst of where the fucking plane crash went down in Pennsylvania! Thank you. Don't you DARE tell me I don't remember. 

My school was right by where it went down, the tiny Mayberry-like peaceful town I grew up in and loved so dearly was hit by evil I hadn't even heard of before. Childhood stopped essentially for us all in that school at the moment I now realize. 

And in the middle of all that we had the damn national guard and police come in full gear with guns, helmets and evacuate the entire school into the basement shelter in case there were more explosions, more burning debris, or worse some accident from the rescue aircraft sent to the crash. We huddled down in shelter that was for maybe made for 100 with several hundred of us for hours hearing choppers, sirens, seeing the horrible field on the TVs they hauled in just so we'd know something about what was happening down the road. All us kids were silent for hours in there. Shocked into muteness. Then one-by-one our parents showed up late in the day in tears to take us all home. Passing cop cars and news vans screeching back the other way to the pit of death in that field. 

Not to mention a classmate of mine had a father who worked at the Navy Department in the Pentagon and we sat there and watched his workplace burn on TV right next to her as she broke down on to the floor in hysterics. Stuck there with us not being to do anything or know anything since she lived in PA with her mom, not being able to even call because no one could get through the phone lines to DC. We all thought just watched her dad die in real time on CNN while she shrieked in agony and recoiled in visible pain. 

So PLEASE don't tell me I don't remember. PUH-LEASE. Don't you try to imply I don't know it wasn't simply a time marker alone, which for one thing, I NEVER EVEN SAID. My understanding of the significance was clearly evident by the words MONUMENTAL. It's called a fucking context clue. But no, you're illiterate and thought it was my fault and you were gonna ""gotcha"" me over how patriotic 9-11 righteous you where when you have NO IDEA who's on the opposite side of your screen and what I knew, what I saw. 

And that all I was doing was simply explaining why someone would bring it up in such a manner as just a monumental time marker- IE meaning: just monumental in the extent and universality of which the horrendous world changing event serves as a compass point in everyone's lives who lived through it. In the range of catastrophic events we've only had 2 times ever before. It's JUST MONUMENTAL. M'kay?! Obviously that shows I get the gravity. The whole point of my post was saying that just monumental BECAUSE NOTHING WILL EVER BE THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE AND NOTHING'S BEEN THE SAME SINCE. 

Get it now?

THANK YOU. So unless you saw that field filled with of charred plane full of human beings crushed to powder unless you smelled the jet fuel and DEATH.

Through all my medical issues, I've learned one thing myself and by observing other patients- if your doctor isn't listening to you and your status isn't getting any better, they aren't even exploring options to search for: it's time to find a different doctor. Cause that's not good medical care. 

I know that's easier said than done for a lot of people to be able to switch doctors with insurance and everything, and finding neuro-opthamologists can hard too if you're not near a major city. But in these kind of scenarios it's a serious necessity. 

I got the run-around for years from doctors on my endometriosis because I was so young. Also had trouble with my IIH, the first doctor I went to on it wrote me off. I asked for a second opinion and that doctor found anomalies in my vision tests immediately and eventually diagnosed me. 

You can't just trust your doctor if they're giving off such worrisome signals and especially if you're not being heard. Those are big warning signs you have a bad doctor and could put your health in danger.  

Trust your gut and if you feel disregarded be firm about advocating for yourself. 

That might means finding a new doctor, or asking to see another doctor in the practice you currently go to for a second opinion, or if you can't leave your current doctor, be strong and let them know exactly how you're feeling about their services. Even come into your appointments with actual references to articles or studies that link the shots and IIH if you have to. Do whatever you have to to get the best care and be heard."

Unfortunately, you know we're not as likely to be fertile as is with the endo to begin with. That's the first thing that my gynecological surgeon endo specialist said.

It takes a few months for your system to adjust at first and that's when you'll have more acute symptoms but then things even out. Now I only get flashes every so often at night or when sick w/ a fever. IDK if it's because we already have a lot of these menopausal/hormonal symptoms with endo, it wasn't a shocking foreign experience to me. The menopausal symptoms are nothing compared to the hormonal shit I'd have when I was ovulating with endo. (That was a nightmare.)

I'm not even on anything to manage the menopause cause it's so minimal & being FTM I didn't want the female hormones. But they give you something for that if you want it.

Sex drive hasn't changed. If anything I'm more into it now cause I'm not in agonizing pain non-stop.

I have a life now. I can't express that enough. I wasn't living before my hysterectomy. I was a prisoner."

JUSTNOFAMILY,ff7297v,t3_ery2l1,1579639671.0,"We've had to explore this from an abusive sibling of mine who was endangering her kids. In my state at least (PA), grandparents rights are mostly based on the issue of whether or not the grandparents have ever lived with the children for a sustained amount of time (months & up) or if one of the birth parents is dead.

(I see your dad lives with you, that could be an issue. He might have a case. You should really speak to a family lawyer for consultant at least.)

We were told it was highly unlikely for a grandparents rights case to be successful without those unless there were extraordinary circumstances- extreme neglect due to open drug abuse, etc.

From the parents standpoint there are certain things you should do to boost your case in case they file-

\*You must show you did not want, nor encourage, and made attempts to limit their access to children for a length of time. This shows you indeed had serious misgivings about their contact with the child and that enforced contact would be potentially harmful to them. (This one is going to be tough with your dad in your house. The argument he could make was obviously you weren't concerned about his influence and access to the children since you had him living with them. This is a problem. Is there a way to get him out?)

\*You should document the toxic behavior of theirs that exists that is the reason for your desire to limit contact too and that support your case. Emails, letters, documents, make contemporaneous notes of their behavior. Make the notes dated and descriptive (place, duration, those involved, the who/what/where/why/whens) and bound in a composition notebook (so any removed pages would be evident, then never tear out any pages and fill it in in order by date). You can also take photographs of anything that you might see visually that's harmful (for an extreme example- does grandma carry a bottle of whiskey and loaded gun in her purse? grab a photo of it, that kind of thing). Some people record things but the legality of recording people on video and audio by state varies and without consent they can sometimes constitute wiretapping (I believe that might include NY) so that's not something I'd try without consulting a lawyer to make sure you're totally in the clear.

\*You should also have any witnesses to their behavior or people who can speak to their poor character ready to write a supporting letters on your behalf. 

These are just the basics, I'd again say contact a lawyer for a more detailed plan of action. But these are things you can get a head start on to help your side."

UnresolvedMysteries,ff6mcau,t3_erq93w,1579630263.0,"Sketches are notoriously hit or miss. Especially considering the 2 in this case are completely different. They won't be able to go off them much due to that.

They'll probably use it more as a measuring stick of a already suspected individual not go looking for a suspect just based off of the sketches.

What I immediately noticed was does that look like a guy who could easily walk that bridge trail? Let alone kill two older (thus stronger) aged children near it? Probably not, he seems a little too heavy, a little too old to be able to do that physically and reasonably swiftly.

Also in the news report it's pretty clear he's a run of the mill criminal, he's got all kinds of accusations from robbery, guns, drugs, rapes, assault. General purpose low-life yes, but no history of murder accusations however and that's the most important thing they are likely to be searching for. And nothing in the news reports mentions he targets the specific age range victims like Indiana. Quite the opposite, he's all over the map, he's got male victims, women (no ages or mention of them being young), a pregnant lady. He's clearly an opportunist, not a somebody who would risk killing 2 kids in broad daylight along a trail he knows other people are on- that's not easy and very high risk. He likes low risk that's what the date rape drug is for. And speaking of that he's clearly got a hallmark when he does commit his crimes, using date rape drugs. Not overcoming people with sheer force like Indiana. It just doesn't add up or even seem remotely similar.

For the relative proficiency with how the Indiana killer worked, the odds are police are looking for a person who's murdered before and is probably a rapist whose victims have also been the same age-specific range & gender. Teen girls or other younger looking women."

Wait what? Am I misunderstanding what you're saying or did you really just say there won't ever be a cancer cure because what....hospitals and medicine companies make money from it? That's what that sentence means?

Hospitals and medical companies wouldn't hold back a cancer cure over money. If your patients are dead from cancer you can't make anything off of them!!! Duh!

Secondly a curing treatment would be in such universal demand whoever finds it will probably make the biggest fortune in medical history.

My second laparoscopy helped for about 2 years.
