relationship_advice,ffcce5h,t3_esufvn,1579796419.0,I think you need therapy. You mentioned he has 2 bachelor’s degrees AND 2 master’s degrees... plus he has the ability to hold down minimum wage jobs in the meantime...? And that’s just not good enough for you??? Maybe he doesn’t want to be a fucking doctor! Maybe he wants to put his degrees to another use ffs. If him not being a doctor is this much of a big deal to you then leave him for his own good. The trash always takes itself out.

unpopularopinion,ff4p1kg,t3_erlhcq,1579568998.0,"Different drugs affect different people differently. If you are an adult with a clean mental health history than the chances of a ‘harmful’ side effect from marijuana is pretty low. Marijuana is much safer than alcohol, or other rec drugs. But it depends on the person. Some people cannot handle it. For me, if I drink 2 or 3 beers I can barely function. I’ve never once had a good experience with alcohol. But I can smoke a few joints and feel great. My best friend is the opposite. She can drink all night long no problem, but 2 hits from my joint and she has no self control."

AskReddit,fezsmfr,t1_fezm11u,1579461128.0,Yeah I can relate. I recently had to end shit with my best friend. I guess it’s better this way. I do miss her sometimes. I’d rather be alone than feel lonely around someone that’s supposed to care about me the same way. And I’m not close with family either so we’re on the same boat. Something I do is just look for someone that looks even more miserable and alone than I do. Whether it be in college or at work or whatever. Thats how I make acquaintances.
AskReddit,fezqjjd,t3_eqvh0p,1579460388.0,Honestly fine. Despite recently ending things with my best friend. Plus I feel like my boyfriend is falling out of love. A word of advice to anyone on here: The trash always takes itself out. I’m not going to dwell on people who don’t care about me the same way I care about them. I spent way too much time doing that. Being alone doesn’t mean you have to be lonely. People who seemingly have tons of friends often times have problems within their friend groups. I feel like friend groups always talk shit about each other behind each other’s backs lol. Wouldn’t want to be a part of something like that. Just focus on being your own best friend. If you can do that then you won’t feel so alone

unpopularopinion,fesl9y8,t1_fesi1k1,1579366407.0,"Agreed, couldn’t have said it better. The ‘debates’ have become more of a contest, rather than a productive conversation. It’s very sad in today’s day and age that we have to put labels on everything. I have conservative views, and I have liberal views. Every time I voice my opinion on a particular matter, the opposite ‘side’ immediately dismisses my opinion. I’m not a conservative or a liberal. I’m a citizen with an opinion. As we all are. We need to work on agreeing to disagree. Different opinions is what makes our country free. And we need to realize and embrace that. I love having conversations with people I disagree with. Even though I might disagree, it gives me an entirely new perspective on the issue."

We’ve become two completely different people, and maybe that is for the better. But my boyfriend/ex is who I am so concerned about. He is just so tired and hurt by me it’s killing me inside. I absolutely hate it. I’m always going to want to work things out and be with him, but I’m beginning to think that he is just better off without me. I’ve being doing nothing but causing him pain. But I do need to start taking better care of myself and my depression. I’ve tried to go to therapy multiple times but it just never works for me. I also do not do well with medication.

AskWomen,fde16fw,t3_ekvi2h,1578328849.0,I never liked it because it wasn’t a common name. People would ask me when I was born all the time (My name is a season.

AskReddit,fcicgo4,t3_eh8gs2,1577660504.0,"I smoked pretty much every day in high school. At the time I was very depressed and needed to take the edge off so I could function like a normal human being. It was great for a while, but looking back now I could have done so much better academically had I just learned healthy coping mechanisms. When I started college, I decided to cut back immensely and only smoke on the weekends after work, when I had my homework done. This was much better for me and my grades really improved. I started to exercise and read more as a way to cope with depression. I hadn’t really exercised or read when I was smoking every day. I started to have intense vivid dreams for the first 2 weeks of cutting back. It was awesome. I also felt more in tune with myself, and now I can’t stand laying around all day doing nothing. I still smoke, but only after I’ve gotten everything done for the week and have free time. Smoking a joint in the woods is still my absolute favorite thing to do when I’m feeling stressed."
