snakes,fff4zx3,t1_ffek19x,1579875849.0,It just doesn't look like pre-shed to me *shrug* with any snake I've interacted with. I hope for her sake that it is though.

MonitorLizards,feyqc67,t1_feynibq,1579449264.0,"I agree that being willing to listen and adjust helps, but it's obviously still not ideal. Hence why I said one thing, then switched to actual helpful advice. I didn't see the previous post, apparently.

And yeah, they don't understand glass, which is why I suggested covering it. To provide solid sides that he can comprehend a little better?"
MonitorLizards,feyedu7,t3_equhfh,1579444342.0,"This is gonna make me a jerk but. You shouldn't have adopted/rescued an animal that you weren't prepared for.

Other comment is correct. He needs substrate deep enough to burrow in, things to climb, multiple hides, some somewhat buried in said substrate. A good size water space that he can swim in. I would move your heat and UVB to one end rather than the middle. Wouldn't hurt to cover the sides of what I presume is a tank, sometimes the glass is confusing and could be giving him additional anxiety.

Diet is a whole big thing too, he shouldn't just have rodents they're high in fat.

You're going to be building/buying a pretty huge enclosure for him pretty soon, so get ready for that.

I would get him a proper setup then let him settle in a bit before you try to socialize with or handle him."
rapecounseling,fepnhja,t3_eqbiyg,1579325244.0,"Damn. I'm sorry that happened to you, that such a trash person was allowed to be in your life and now appear to open old wounds. Our stories are pretty dissimilar, but I wanted to tell you that you're heard. And I want you to find an animal to hug, and then call someone to talk to. Hotline, doctor you see regularly, doesn't matter. Healing is something you need, and maybe this is a good opportunity to seek it. Eating yourself to death, while tasty, isn't the answer."
