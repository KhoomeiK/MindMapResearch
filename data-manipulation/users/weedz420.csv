PrequelMemes,ff71me2,t1_ff6ryrh,1579639326.0,"It was an alright movie on it's own; but the problem was they Game of Thrones Season 8'd it and invalidated / made the entire rest of the saga not make sense. And it didn't explain shit when it was supposed to be the final film in the main saga.

I.e.) how was Anakin the Chosen One and fulfilled his destiny if Sidious can just come back from the dead, how did he even come back from the dead, new force healing ability out of nowhere (even usable if someone is dead), what the F was Snoke, why did the mural on the floor of the first jedi temple look exactly like Snoke in 7, what about the droid attack on the wookies?, etc.."
videos,feyv9fg,t1_fewisgv,1579450963.0,It's true.
