It's sad to hear her say things like that about people of other races and even her own race. It seems like she suffers a lot from internalised racism and sees white people as this ""pure"" race or ""perfect"" race which is absolutely absurd. She should lift herself up instead of putting herself and, most importantly, others down. You should tell her that."
mulattos,ffvqwfw,t1_ffvqm9s,1580270749.0,I'm sorry you've had go to through that. I know how you feel. Could you tell me more about the girl who claims to be black but still says bad things about black people? Could you give me examples of the things she's said?
mixedrace,ffvphmw,t1_ffvnfwf,1580269696.0,We can't. In order to achieve true tolerance we must stop tolerating intolerance.
mixedrace,ffvn1cy,t1_ffvmasg,1580267986.0,"Exactly. ""I can't be racist against someone because I don't hold societal power and only people who hold the most societal power can be racist"", bullshit. That's like saying ""I can't be a thief because I don't have any money and only people who hold the most money can be thieves"". It doesn't make any sense."
mixedrace,ffvll1n,t1_ffvjvjf,1580266989.0,"You're correct on the first sentence. Racism is prejudice *and* discrimination *and* antagonism against someone based on their race. But your definition of racism isn't the correct definition of racism. In no dictionary will you find a definition saying that racism has something to do with societal power. It doesn't matter which race or ethnicity currently holds the most societal power, if you discriminate or antagonise someone based on their race, it's racism. Plain and simple. That's why you can also be racist against white people."
mixedrace,ffvk22b,t3_evd9do,1580265956.0,"I also used to identify myself as black until I was constantly being told I wasn't black because I've also got white ancestry. It's safe to say these people killed my black identity. But life goes on and you'll eventually find out who you are, even if it didn't happen today. Your identity might, and most likely will, change over the course of time just like it happened with me. And there's nothing wrong with that. 

What you want to identify as, that's what you are. No matter what anyone tells you! Many people even call albino people white even though genetically they're 100% African. Sounds stupid? Because it is. Remember, people don't know what you are deep down inside. Only you do."
mixedrace,ffvj0ox,t3_ev99vo,1580265253.0,"I'm glad you're attracted to a person and even more glad that they like you back! I assume you're from the United States, as in your story you mention how virtually everyone has made such a fuss about your race? Here in Europe we don't care about race that much at all. Of course we acknowledge it but we don't let it determine our relationships or how we talk to people. We don't assume someone belonging to race X is automatically Y and so forth. 

If the white boy you're attracted to only likes you because you're Asian then that should be a deal breaker. Believe me, I've had white people say to me they want to hang out with me because I'm half black (or in their eyes, black). If he fetishises you because you're Asian, then that should DEFINITELY be a deal breaker. The sad truth is, you never really know what the ulterior motive of people being around you is. Of course the majority of people are around you because they like and care about you and you're good company, but there are other kinds of people, too. 

You could nonchalantly ask him whether he sees you as his friend, as his female friend or as his Asian friend. If he sees you as either of the first two then I wouldn't call it a problem. But if he saw you as the last one, then he might primarily like you because you're Asian and then like you because you're you."
mixedrace,ffvfyxb,t1_ffu8x6x,1580263219.0,"You're right, but nevertheless they've had a large amount of foreign people in their country for decades already. If division based on ethnicity or race was needed, they would've inducted a division like that already. 

Why do you believe this kind of division based on ethnicity and race is needed?"
mixedrace,ffveffo,t1_ffv0hwe,1580262186.0,"First, let's look at the definition of racism. According to Lexico (Oxford Dictionaries), racism is ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized"". *Typically* one that is a minority or marginalised, but not solely. Thus you **can** be racist against white people, even if you belonged in the minority and they in the majority. 

I do understand how deadly racism can be. People have chased me shouting that they're going to kill me since I was a child, just because I've got certain ancestry. That still doesn't mean I have to be ""saved"" from a certain race or that I necessarily need a safe space from a certain race, just because a very small percent of a certain race acts differently against me because of my own ethnicity and/or race. 

Reading that kind of statistics about Native American women is heartbreaking. That's something that never should happen to anyone. But do you happen to have a source to back up your claims that Native women have a 1 in 2 change of being raped and that the majority of those who rape them are white men? 

Unfortunately being prejudiced against someone because of their race and thus discriminating them is the very definition of racism. In no dictionary will you find a sentence saying that ""racism is prejudice or discrimination by white people against non-white people"". 

I live in Finland which, according to statistics, is the most racist country in the European Union. I still don't feel like I need to be afraid of white people as I know that the vast majority of white people in this country aren't racist. I do admit that I need to be afraid of *some* white people, but excluding them **all** from my life because some of them have discriminated against me? Absolutely ridiculous. 

Even if you don't yourself believe in it, you can be racist against white people as racism is being prejudiced against white people (like OP, ""it’s fucked up to say all white people think alike but they sort of do"") or discriminating against white people (""any white person being friendly with me is just going to get ignored"", ""fuck them"")."
mulattos,ffvb7yf,t1_ffuhkue,1580260025.0,Would you like to share your experiences of racism from black people?

mixedrace,ffvb1we,t1_ffu95tx,1580259912.0,"Sorry to hear that. The argument ""you aren't black because you don't look black"" lacks intelligence because there are albino people, for example, who are 100% black even though they don't look like your average black person. Even though many fail to admit it, there's a lot of racism going on among PoCs, also in the black community."
mulattos,ffu5y4w,t3_eu9w9j,1580235188.0,"You're fine as you are. Do you already know what you identify as? Your identity might, and probably will change over the course of time. I'm half black, half white and I used to identify myself as black when I was your age. Nowadays I identify myself as mixed, which is essentially what I am. I embrace both my blackness and my whiteness and I'm completely fine as who I am. You will be too, don't you worry about that!"
mixedrace,ffu4ppq,t1_ffu433o,1580234442.0,"I used to identify myself as black for years but as I met more and more black people who told me they didn't see me as black and thus didn't accept me, I eventually started to identify myself as mixed, which is what I essentially am.

mixedrace,ffu3ifx,t1_ffrjuls,1580233701.0,That sounds like a tough situation. I'm an individual who's sure had his share of racism and my advice is to try to stop caring.

I've gotten bad looks from black people when I've been out with my white friends. Also some black people get offended when you're half black, half white and you identify as mixed (which you essentially are). I believe it's because they see it as mixed people being ashamed of their blackness, which is definitely not the case. It's merely embracing both your blackness and whiteness."
mixedrace,ffu0dem,t1_fftu1tp,1580231746.0,"I understand your point, as (according to Wikipedia) a safe space refers to ""places created for individuals who feel marginalized to come together to communicate regarding their experiences with marginalization"". I understand that we as PoCs are marginalised in the Western world. But to completely discriminate against white people (""any white person being friendly with me is just going to get ignored"") because of prejudices (""it’s fucked up to say all white people think alike but they sort of do"")? That's racism and morally wrong. You can have a safe space without completely discriminating against a certain race, even if they were the majority and privileged in society."

mixedrace,ffto50y,t1_fftn12p,1580225414.0,"It needs to be acknowledged that many white people may think and act that way too, and I believe it's as morally wrong as anyone, including PoCs, thinking and acting that way. Imagine if OP was a white person saying he/she is tired of PoCs and doesn't want to associate with them in any way.  ""Fuck them"", they'd say. Imagine him/her saying that protecting yourself from PoCs and a safe space from PoCs is needed. Sounds racist, doesn't it? Because it is."
mixedrace,fftn9pg,t1_fftm6ga,1580224839.0,"In most countries racism against white people isn't a thing? Do you believe in the concept of ""reverse racism"" not existing? I don't believe in ""reverse racism"" existing, there's just racism, as simple as that. If you're ignoring someone based on their ethnicity and/or race, that's discrimination. If you're discriminating someone based on their ethnicity and/or race, it's racism. It doesn't matter who belongs in the majority and who belongs in the minority."
