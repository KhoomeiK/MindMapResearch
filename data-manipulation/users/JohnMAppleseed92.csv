MDMA,ffpz53f,t1_ffpysoh,1580111851.0,"I just rolled for the first time in about two years. It was a great experience. Every experience is unique. I think part of it is your mindset and being by your close friends. If I do mdma and I’m not with close friends or meeting people right away, it will not work as well.

Even before that though, I had plenty good experiences rolling. I waited a year or so after my binge, but I guess it’s been a while since I lost the magic. Are you sure you’re getting good rolls?"
MDMA,ffpymzk,t1_ffp5ous,1580111171.0,"Nah, not for the rest of your life. I can attest I had a few binges 5 years ago, so I quit for several years before resuming occasional use. Eventually the magic came back."

I think the two could definitely result in a nod mixing with some intense visuals. I’m asking out of curiosity and not judging: is xans okay to take with fentanyl? I always thought the respiratory effects were dicey."
confessions,ffp2n3m,t1_ffp214x,1580084961.0,"I know that you say that you don’t feel guilty, but I think your subconscious is telling you that you don’t feel guilty, so that you can receive what you deem as necessary judgement (self-punishment that you feel you deserve) from people on this thread. Think about it this way: Would you really be posting here and saying you don’t feel bad about it, if you actually felt okay about cheating on your girlfriend? Probably not. You would have moved on. 

So we’ve gotten that out of the way. Clearly you feel guilty. So why do you think you actually hurt someone that you should care about? Was she doing something that made you upset? Was she the perfect girlfriend? What was going on in your life at the time? Do you or did you feel self-destructive? 

None of these questions in any way justify your actions, but in order to correct your future behavior, you need to question what caused your past behavior. Clearly you feel bad about it, so why would you do something to hurt those close to you, and by indirect action, hurt yourself? Ask yourself these questions and refrain from negative self talk and calling yourself names, and you should get to the root problem here."

It was my first time going out to a bar in a long time, and my friend had already set us up with some girls. I think I may have been more anxious then I thought. And the one mg just wasn’t cutting it. I had just worked out and I hadn’t eaten well that day. I think I may have been a bit dehydrated. All of those factors may have influenced my experience.

quittingkratom,ffjxkoz,t1_ffjwvus,1580009720.0,"I find that a bit odd that he would be so sure you’re going through PAWS at day 5 since acute opioid withdrawal typically peaks around day 3 and lasts for around 5-7 days. 

I’m not a doctor, but I would be hesitant to assume you are going through PAWS until a few weeks have passed. By believing that you are in fact in PAWS could have a negative impact on your mental state and prognosis, like the placebo effect. 

I also see that you relapsed once within your acutes. Although relapsing once will not necessarily send you back to day one, it does have the potential to prolong the acute process. 

Medical literature is a bit nebulous on PAWS to begin with. Be careful with some PAWS treatments, as they may end up being counter productive in the end. Opiate antagonists may be good for cravings and reducing symptoms. Other than that, I would hate for you to pick up another habit or even a medication dependence to something with the semblance of being benign such as antidepressants when it is not necessary. Regardless, time is usually the best medicine."
depression,ffjwb2x,t1_ffjw2dh,1580008708.0,The best thing I learned to do distract myself and not think about feeling bad- eliminate all negative self talk and sources of negativity. I can see that that’s hard to do if you’re reading this sub.
serialkillers,ffjkkly,t3_etzcpg,1580000351.0,"I have also been interested in this for quite some time. I have a book that may be of some interest to you called “The Psychopath- Emotion and the Brain” by James Blair, Derek Mitchell, and Karina Blair. It’s contents explains the difference between Sociopathy and Psychopathy from a clinical and neuroscientific Perspective. It is a bit dense, and very empirical. The case studies do not mention specific notorious murderers, but it focuses on the primordial brain development and conditional factors that lead to criminal and anti-social behavior."
quittingkratom,ffjjqts,t1_ffjhr36,1579999798.0,"Just for your assay, PAWS is more of a long term issue that occurs a minimum of several weeks after usage and has the potential to last for several months depending on the substance. You would not be experiencing PAWS at your 100 hour mark, nor would you be experiencing it within the first couple weeks. Kratom has serotonin properties to it, so the acute withdrawal can last a bit longer. If you were addicted to any opiate, you would most likely still be in the acutes after 100 hours. I think what you’re experiencing is the individual nature of the withdrawal itself. You may have been feeling good initially due to the surge of dopamine and adrenaline that your body may have been deficient on, now that those levels have stabilized, you are more affected by the absence of endogenous endorphins and serotonin. Your body and brain  will likely take several weeks to a month to stabilize itself- endorphins generally recover quicker, whereas serotonin can have a longer and more protracted withdrawals, as evidenced by serotonin acting antidepressants.

I would suggest that you go out and do some cardiovascular or any kind of physical exercise. Try to keep busy and set small reasonable goals to activate your brains natural reward and pleasure system without the use of drugs. This will speed up the process and keep your mind off of disposition."

I was in 3,600 mgs Gabapentin for a year and I used to take the two together sometimes and separately other times. I never noticed a difference. I never used more the 1.7 gs on a regular basis of phenibut. Were you looking for a specific feeling that you got with 3gs? Maybe your physiology is a bit different because 3GS would have put me to sleep for a few days."
phenibut,fffvzyi,t3_eteww0,1579893013.0,"Just so you know, there isn’t actually cross tolerance between phenibut and Gabapentin. I know they are both Gabapentinoids technically, but most of the withdrawals from phenibut come from its GABA-b activity. Gabapentin is not known to cause crazy withdrawals and psychosis upon cessation. They are very different substances.

Check out the Doors of Perception by Adolous Huxley. I don’t agree that LSD connects you to another realm, but it can share similar characteristics to known ‘religious epiphanies’ I’m an atheist, so I don’t agree with anything spiritual. Some people who trip acid are very pretentious and ill informed regarding where these paradigms came from. 

Also, drugs have been connected to spiritual practices with native Americans for centuries. Have you heard of ayahuasca? These guys may have gotten some ideas from the original entheogen. I for one am not going to call native Americans religious ceremonies pretentious. I’m sure I’m going to get downvoted, but there is a psychological healing power to psychedelics. I don’t believe it’s mystical, but recent studies on psilocybin on PTSD are interesting to say the least. These guys don’t understand why what they’re feeling is impressionable and positive, so they attribute it to the divine- something most people do. I don’t fault them for it.

Summary: doing acid does not connect you to a spiritual realm but because it mimics spiritual experiences in a powerful way, young guys and mystics confuse the two without really understanding the neuroscience."
