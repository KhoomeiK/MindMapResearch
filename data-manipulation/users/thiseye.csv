CFB,fffalv4,t1_fff8bde,1579879735.0,I'm always afraid of Arkansas no matter how bad they are. They have a way of surprising us.
todayilearned,fevtkn8,t1_fevsp2p,1579401318.0,"It was an ELI5, not a debate the merits of the post"
todayilearned,fevnryf,t1_fevngym,1579399474.0,Climbing Mt. Everest costs a lot of money so only people with lots of money do it. If you have lots of money then $4000 is not a lot of money to you
CFB,feedqyg,t1_fecovop,1579031658.0,"To this day, I will never understand how Lee wasn't given a shot. He certainly couldn't have done worse."
CFB,fee6oda,t1_fedl380,1579027510.0,"9 percentage points lower completion percentage than his previous worst outing this season (incidentally, against UT State). He/they definitely had to fight for every yard for much of the game. He still had one of his best QBR's on the season though (again, UT State was his worst (!?) by far)"
CFB,fee4ycv,t1_fee3imf,1579026488.0,Actually hurt his stats. Both playoff games and the SECCG brought his completion percentage down even though he was still very good in most/all of those.
CFB,fedgus0,t1_fedfxhh,1579011164.0,He didn't have an off-season to learn a scheme he's never played before in his life.
CFB,fedgi6y,t1_fedg6wc,1579010901.0,"Really was the difference maker. It was a bold strategy that makes Coach O the hero, but just as easily gets him run out of town if it doesn't work out in their favor."
CFB,fecl9w6,t3_eogbh0,1578976701.0,"You'd think in a 5 hour game, ESPN could manage to show all of the plays. That's like the 5th LSU play they didn't show the snap."
CFB,fec8t62,t1_fec88oj,1578968667.0,Ya they did it better
CFB,fdr8ivj,t1_fdqkvcs,1578680995.0,"yay, that's just what we need. How about the East step up their game?"
LSUFootball,fdpb9kw,t3_eme6pf,1578624325.0,Upvote this if you like LSU! ðŸ¤š
todayilearned,fdp7urx,t1_fdod8jl,1578622042.0,at this time of day at this time of year in this part of the country localized entirely within your closet?
Frugal,fdfi15p,t1_fdeso29,1578362171.0,"""Well gee, that *sounds* great GljohnMGS, but I'm not a *millionaire*. How can a regular Joe like me afford these magic sponges?"""

nfl,fdbrh10,t3_ekjap0,1578260853.0,Vikings are responsible for 4 out of 11 Saints playoffs losses all time
recycling,fd6imcb,t1_fd6hcuq,1578191601.0,"Your mileage may vary depending on your area but worth a shot! Like I said, I don't understand what people do with them as they're not very good moving boxes usually"
recycling,fd6b6iy,t3_ek4r3y,1578188301.0,"Remember reuse before recycle. I put all mine on Craigslist for free every few months and they get taken pretty quickly. No idea what people use them for, but I just did this today and they were gone in a few hours."
CFB,fctlafb,t1_fct4g8o,1577947479.0,I was gonna say honey badger
politics,fcr8d2y,t1_fcqyzl1,1577898269.0,"Most of the urban areas you mentioned have  voted blue for some time, not just Austin"
worldnews,fcne2jf,t1_fcnci7f,1577809774.0,Well they tested if you could trade immediately after a tweet but most of the consequential tweets ended up being when markets were closed so the bot didn't end up doing much.
LSUFootball,fcct41k,t1_fccmoth,1577602316.0,It benefits every other team in the conference financially for us to do well
CFB,fccqohq,t1_fccgtvt,1577601501.0,"We only play in national championships when they're in our backyard. It's a thing we do. 2003, 2007, 2011, and now 2019"
CFB,fcb0t2f,t1_fcb0oo6,1577580444.0,We only play in National Championships in New Orleans. It's our thing
CFB,fcayon9,t1_fcayi1a,1577579235.0,I have some unopened butter extract at home because we were gonna try a recipe a few years ago. We never did
CFB,fcaqrx4,t1_fcaqfxp,1577574743.0,They used to. Buying gift cards with gift cards is generally not allowed in most places for whatever reason
CFB,fcaoiqu,t1_fcaoaj5,1577573387.0,Les?
CFB,fcannef,t1_fcanisz,1577572855.0,I think it's both. Helps each other out that Joe is so accurate and the WRs are very capable of getting open and catching anything close
CFB,fcamm67,t1_fcalha2,1577572251.0,I looked at how OU and LSU played you guys and figured 13.5 was way too big of a spread for us. But maybe it wasn't?
CFB,fcalcp5,t1_fcal4mt,1577571508.0,I feel ya. I'm guessing because it was our first real game and the D took some time to adjust to vastly different pace on offense
CFB,fcakyj8,t1_fcaki2t,1577571261.0,People here are already saying it's the reason despite what happens the rest of the game
CFB,fcakc9h,t1_fcak2li,1577570886.0,Ya that was awful. I was waiting for a replay but nope
