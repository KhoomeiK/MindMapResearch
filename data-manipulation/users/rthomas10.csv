Patience is a learned skill and practice it when you can. It will serve you well in life. (Patience can be seen as confident) Most of the time we are more confident because we have made the mistakes of youth before, the ones that you are making now, a know that the situation will work out in the end with very little effort on our part. Patient observation often wins out. Just remember the lessons of your youth in your later years. :) Then everyone will look at you and ask the same question ""How did he get to be so confident?"""

I see a lot of younger men like this one on here asking the same question. When I was a younger man my parents, mother and father, told me that things would progress this way and not to expect to have it all figured out and I never expected to. However most of the younger generation expect to have it figured out as soon as they are out of HS or College and are concerned because they don't. Weren't they coached on this? Did a generation of parents just forget to do this?"

Edit: Pet insurance. Early years and late years are important for this but you generally need to keep it for the life of your friend. Pups can eat socks, underwear....surgery sometimes. Older dogs have age related issues. I understand that you can't always get insurance but at least start a fund to save for the eventuality. Put away 10 bucks a week or something. Eventually you will need it. We use www.GoPetPlan.com"

Treats, leashes, crate, bowls, bags, collar, chew toys (not rawhide), dog bed,....etc. Nature's Miracle for urine smell control. carpet spot cleaner....etc. Don't know where to end. We have so much dog stuff.

When there is a change in activity level take them out to pee! Wakes up...outside, runs around and settles down...outside, eats....outside, any change in activity level! The more you get them to go outside to pee and poop the more they learn to go outside only. No breaks if they pee inside it's your fault for not reading them right! after their last vaccine start socializing with other dogs! important with huskies cause they can be a bit dominant. Take them to the sidewalk outside the shopping center or mall or something to meet lots of people, let them pet the pup so they get used to lots of people.
