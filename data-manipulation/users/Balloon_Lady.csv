He was likely to young to be a decent father but his own mother sneaking around behind his back to take that choice away was just cruel. It also robbed him of any trust he had that his family would have his back when things got tough. 

It didn't help that after he got married and had two kids it was discovered that his wife was pregnant before meeting him and put the baby up for adoption. My aunt and uncle got divorced for many reasons but high on the list was the fact that my aunt got to reunite with her child when he became an adult and now he, my aunt, and my cousins are all super close.

BalloonTwisting,fepsr9m,t3_epz108,1579330013.0,"It sounds like you're paying a pitch fee and charging per balloon. As you can gather from the above advice that's unusual in our industry. Balloon twisters are usually hired and paid as entertainment not billed a fee like a vendor. But what's done is done.

My general rule of thumb is $1 per balloon with a $2 start fee. That's to say something like a 1 balloon dog would be $2, a 2 balloon pony would be $3, and a 4 balloon wacky hat would be $5.

Helium filled balloons cannot make it into space since they float only because helium is lighter than air and the higher you go the thinner the air is.

NoStupidQuestions,fd3xdx9,t3_ejsr15,1578162440.0,"This is a great question!

First we need to determine what kind of balloon we're discussing. 

Mylar/foil balloons are the devil. They never decompose, are shiny which attracts birds, and retain helium for much longer than latex balloons so they can really travel far. They can also get tangled in power lines and knock the power out. If you use Mylar balloons make sure they are weighed down and ideally inside. 

Latex balloons are biodegradable but it takes a long time. 5+ years is a good STARTING point for how long it takes. The ribbon they are typically tied with are not biodegradable and will be problematic until the sun implodes. Until the balloon returns to dust it's dangerous to animals for both suffocation concerns and blocked gastrointestinal tracts. For this reason the World Clown Association condones balloon releases and all members agree to never participate in a balloon release of any scale for any reason."
