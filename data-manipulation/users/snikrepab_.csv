The U.S. Department of Agriculture has taken another whack at former first lady Michelle Obama’s signature achievement: Establishing stricter nutritional standards for school breakfasts and lunches. And on her birthday.

On Friday, USDA Deputy Under Secretary Brandon Lipps announced [new proposed rules](https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/school-meals-flexibilities-fact-sheet.pdf) for the Food and Nutrition Service that would allow schools to cut the amount of vegetables and fruits required at lunch and breakfasts while giving them the ability to sell more pizza, burgers and fries to students. The agency is responsible for administering nutritional programs that feed nearly 30 million students at 99,000 schools.

Lipps said the changes will help address what he described as unintended issues that developed as a result of the regulations put in place during the Obama administration. For example, when schools were trying to implement innovative solutions such as grab-and-go breakfast off a cart or meals in the classroom, they were forced to give kids two bananas to meet minimum federal requirements.

But Colin Schwartz, deputy director of legislative affairs for Center for Science in the Public Interest, says that the rules, if finalized, “would create a huge loophole in school nutrition guidelines, paving the way for children to choose pizza, burgers, french fries and other foods high in calories, saturated fat or sodium in place of balanced school meals every day.”

He says that limiting the variety of vegetables served allows french fries to become even [more central](https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/news/2018/september/04/study-finds-french-fries-are-number-1-veggie-consumed-by-american-toddlers) to students’ diets. He says the potato lobby has been pushing for this change, and that the potato industry was behind a change that happened quietly [last March](https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-breakfast-program-substitution-vegetables-fruit). The USDA allowed school food authorities participating in the School Breakfast Program to substitute potatoes in place of fruit without including vegetables from other subgroups in the weekly menus.

“The Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 has been called one of the most important obesity-prevention policy achievements in recent decades,” Schwartz said. “Yet the Trump administration seems intent on sabotaging it. While there’s plenty of room to strengthen school nutrition further, these proposals taken together instead are basically aiming a flamethrower at it.”

Potatoes USA, the marketing organization for the 2,500 commercial potato growers, did not respond to requests for comment.

Specifically, the new rules allow schools to cut the amount of fruit included in breakfasts served outside of the cafeteria from one cup to a half cup. The remaining calories could be filled with sweet pastries and granola bars. For lunches, the new rules allow schools to offer potatoes as a vegetable everyday and gives them the flexibility to provide pizza and burgers over more nutritious choices.

Nancy Roman, president of Partnership for a Healthier, said that these announced changes, “sound like a step in the wrong direction. If anything, the science of the past few years suggests that we need even more fruits and vegetables at each meal, and the less processed the better. It’s not just what is on the plate, but how it is prepared. And particularly young children need more exposure to unprocessed, easy-to-eat, fruits, vegetables and greens.”

[*Trump administration rule could end free school lunches for about 500,000 children*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rule-could-end-free-school-lunches-for-about-500000-children/2019/09/24/4c488f66-def1-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_17)

These changes come on the heels of other controversial program alterations rolled out by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in 2019, weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. Perdue cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift. The rule was part of USDA’s Regulatory Reform Agenda, developed in response to President Trump’s executive order to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens.

The rule provided the option to offer flavored, low-fat milk to children participating in school meal programs, and to participants ages six and older in the Special Milk Program for Children and the Child and Adult Care Food Program; it reduced the whole grain requirements to half of the weekly grains served; and it provided more time for schools to comply with reduced sodium levels in meals.

In essence, these shifts allowed foods served in schools to be saltier, fattier or more processed in the name of palatability. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals. About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of school meals is impactful.

Many of these changes flout the good news about the nation’s school nutrition programs reported by last year’s USDA “[School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study](https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-nutrition-and-meal-cost-study),” which was the first comprehensive assessment of school meals after the implementation of Michelle Obama’s[ Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/10/11/make-school-lunches-great-again/?utm_term=.bfc123284e03&tid=lk_inline_manual_4&tid=lk_inline_manual_23).

[*Why is the USDA downplaying good news about this Obama-era school nutrition program?*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/07/why-is-usda-downplaying-good-news-about-this-obama-era-school-nutrition-program/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_24)

Under the Obama administration, the nutrition guidelines for schools that participated in the National School Lunch Program shifted, requiring cafeterias to increase their offering of fruits and vegetables, serve only skim or low-fat milk and cut trans-fat from the menu altogether. They also required school cafeterias to cut sodium in the food they were serving.

The study showed that, after the implementation of these healthy food changes, the [Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810369/), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches: Scores went from 49.6 out of 100 in school year 2009-2019 to 71.3 by 2014-2015.

And while Perdue has argued that healthier food offerings mean more food waste and lower participation in the programs, the USDA study revealed that there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards and that food waste remained relatively unchanged.

The School Nutrition Association is the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals which has frequently advocated for less stringent nutritional requirements. Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that while the organization can’t comment on the new rules until they have been release , but says that the SNA recently released a [2020 Position Paper,](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__schoolnutrition.org_legislation-2Dpolicy_action-2Dcenter_2020-2Dposition-2Dpaper_&d=DwMFAg&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=xEHLg2qSNqg257YWWXr-I32xUNg8mqaVQk_q-DUFMHE&m=AZpHqlVXE54VTjXRegS90PSaNFVhEPPY0tRE9RnA0-A&s=uWuvSCKWwRfp6SMogazKOPqJwWFtOh4QbyjP8A582ag&e=) which calls on Congress to preserve the current flexibility on whole grains, sodium and milk.

“We support efforts to streamline overly complex child nutrition programs,” she said.

news,fenqh45,t1_fenqf06,1579289285.0,"CDC staff will ask travelers about symptoms, places they have visited in Wuhan, and take temperatures. Suspected cases of illness will be transported safely to pre-designated facilities in those cities, Cetron said. Many will likely end up being referred for further evaluation, and that may take hours and up to a day, officials said. As a result, “it’s unlikely they will make immediate connecting flights,” Cetron said.

CDC officials acknowledged that in the middle of winter, it’s far more likely that symptoms will be caused by common winter viruses than the new virus, he said. At airports in Asia, authorities have screened thousands of people before they identified the one or two individual cases, he said.

The three cases outside China include two Chinese tourists who flew to Thailand. The first tourist is in stable condition. The second arrived in Thailand on Monday with a fever, Thai authorities said. The third case is a Chinese resident of Japan whose case was confirmed on Thursday. He has recovered. All three travelers flew from Wuhan.

New information from China[ late Friday](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011809065) about additional infections among people who had close contact with initial patients, but did not go the animal market believed to be the origin of the outbreak, provides more evidence for human to human transmission. The patient in Japan also had not been to the Wuhan animal market but had “potential close contact with unspecified pneumonia patients in China,” according to the [Japanese Ministry of Health](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_08906.html).

One reason for concern is that the new pathogen is in the family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The[ SARS epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/04/24/thousands-flee-beijing-fearing-sars/da04ce95-058d-408c-ad97-a8f2017e4058/?tid=lk_inline_manual_23) began in China in November 2002 and over eight months, infected more than 8,000 people, killed 774 and sparked mass panic as it spread across more than two dozen countries before it was contained in the summer of 2003.

SARS spread to humans through infected civet cats sold in live animal markets. Most patients in the Wuhan outbreak also worked or had some other exposure to a [large live animal and seafood market](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011509040) that Chinese authorities shut down Jan. 1.

The airport screening is the first time such monitoring has been deployed for an infectious disease since the Ebola epidemic in 2014, when officials screened travelers arriving at U.S. airports from three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Since Wednesday, passengers at the international airport in Wuhan have been required to pass through electronic temperature sensors at each of its doors, according to the South China Morning Post. Anyone with a temperature over 100 degrees is required to undergo a manual check and if high temperature is confirmed, “spend a period of time in a quarantine facility.”

Health officials say they don’t yet have enough information to draw conclusions about whether the new virus can spread easily from person to person, or describe its clinical features. The source of the virus also remains unknown.

But the emergence of a new respiratory illness that originated from an animal has raised concerns among health officials and infectious disease experts. If an infected person gets on a plane, “they have the potential to transmit the virus on the way, and the more people who are infected, the more chances the virus has to replicate in people and mutate,” said Matt Freiman, a virologist and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who studies [coronaviruses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html).

Human coronaviruses, known for their crown-like spikes on their surfaces, cause illnesses of differing severity. Some transmit easily. Novel coronaviruses emerge periodically, with SARS emerging in southern China in 2002 and MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, a decade later.

With cases of the new virus found in Japan and the most recent case in Thailand, there is increased worry of spread to a wider area, Freiman said.

“This also suggests that either animals shedding the virus are still in Wuhan or that there is more human-to-human spread than is recognized,” he said. “Both of these scenarios are problematic for control of this new virus.”

Of 45 confirmed cases in China, most were male, middle-aged and elderly, with early symptoms of fever and cough, Wuhan health authorities said. The patients included a man who worked at the closed market and his wife, who had never visited it. The two who died were both men over 60 with underlying chronic diseases. The first had been a regular customer at the market, but health authorities have not said whether the second had contact with it. Five others are reported to have severe illnesses.

Of the 45 cases, four — all men — were reported late Friday, Wuhan health authorities said. Their condition is stable. In addition, of 17 close contacts of the first confirmed patient in Thailand, at least one has low fever and mild cough, authorities said.

The number of serious illnesses indicate this “is a big worry, this is a legitimate infection and that this is really going to cause problems,” Freiman said.

Controlling transmission and finding the animal source are key, say health officials. Chinese authorities said specimens collected from the closed market tested positive for the new virus.

Several countries in Asia have increased surveillance and entry screening at airports and other transport hubs. Suspect cases with pneumonia and recent travel history to Wuhan have been detected in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.

Analysis of air travel patterns to map the potential spread of the new virus found that the top 20 destinations for travelers from Wuhan are in Asia. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest volume, according to a study in the Journal of Travel Medicine, based on 2018 travel data."

I have worked with middle school students for the past three years and most students with IEPs have been boys.
