"" The most recent inflow of water from the now heavily controlled Colorado River was accidentally created by the engineers of the [California Development Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Development_Company) in 1905. In an effort to provide water into the Imperial Valley for farming, beginning in 1900, an irrigation canal was dug from the Colorado River to the old Alamo River channel, directing the water west and then north near Mexicali. The headgates and canals suffered silt buildup, so a series of cuts were made in the bank of the Colorado River to further increase the water flow. The resulting outflow overwhelmed the third intake, ""Mexican Cut"", near [Yuma, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuma,_Arizona), and the river flowed into the Salton Basin for two years, filling what was then a dry lake bed and creating the modern sea, before repairs were completed ""

We had the export of oil banned up until late into Obama presidency, it being legal to export is a relatively recent development.  That ban was in place for nearly 30 years.

> Finally, transportation and other logistical costs are already built into prices, 

Yes and no, yes the infrastructure and middlemen to export exists, no not every company producing oil in the US has said infrastructure or works through said middlemen.  When you use someone else's infrastructure you pay for it.  So if your a domestic producer selling domestically the price differential has to be high enough to justify you using a middleman."

The term your looking for is elastic vs inelastic.

> You think US gas companies will sell prices at the same price in the United States when they can sell it for 25% more internationally 

Depends in part on the price of transport and whether they have the logistics capacity to export.  This is also ignoring the fact that the US government has no problem banning export.   Finally, while the ME produces quite a bit of oil their is actually quite a bit of global oversupply at current and losing access to ME oil is partly built into the price already."

In a stable democracy it is rare to cut a social service, one they go on the books they are nigh impossible to remove.  It is part of the reason SS is so fucked, you can't even begin a political discussion on it.

They are basically incomparable subjects.  Military spending frequently goes up and down since WWII, social services on the other hand basically only go up.  For comparison -

So yes/no? Did I ignore responding to it in full yes, did I ignore what they were incorrectly asserting, no.   That is also ignoring the fact that the kind of additional tax you would get for most military issues is incomparably small to the behemoth of a tax increase you would get for a public good like universal healthcare.

ehhhhhh. I think your just not looking at a long enough timeline if you truly believe that.  We have just had I think it was the most peaceful decade in history for example.  Beyond that people the world over are better off than they have been in basically recorded history.  Things like food security, basic education violence as a whole are at the best levels basically ever seen.  

Alot of this one way or another has much to do with the political shift of the world, where your average person has greatly more influence over how their government behaves.  A lot of this comes down to one of the biggest things that has pushed societal revolution, technology.  Our ability to communicate with and understand our world has been rapidly progressing for basically the last 300 years.   This has pushed slow but sure societal and political change that on the whole is for the better.   

Think about it, 300 years ago you most likely lived in some sort of monarchy, likely did not know how to read, getting a solid meal every day would have been perfectly doable but challenging and you had little if any sway over your system of governance unless a lord or some sort got pissed off.  

Hell just look at the last 100 years in Europe and America (hell even China), the amount you know about your government and your ability to influence it is greatly increased.  in the 20's if I recall my history correctly the US was on the gold standard which is profoundly shit for the working man.   One of the reasons we are off the gold standard is because the ability of your average person to influence government.  I.E. Deflation."

The end point was Iran was given a bunch of cash it didnt have before.  So the spirit of that claim is true, even if the exact details are a bit murky based on wording.
