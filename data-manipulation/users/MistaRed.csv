And while i won't really argue that pigs and cows and such are better off in farms, but it's pretty arrogant to think that somebody can decide whether a stray cat or dog is better off dead or not as these animals tend to be unmolested most of the time(I'm not against mercy killing, but the way PETA seems to be doing it is honestly a little top much)"
