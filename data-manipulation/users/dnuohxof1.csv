sysadmin,ffcakny,t3_esewdz,1579795272.0,"Personally I don’t like disabling wallpaper choice for my users. We’re not in a highly branded or super secure marketplace or anything and I enjoy the freedom, so should my users.

I hear horror stories of nude Pamela Anderson’s, shameful Facebook photos, and political rags but I have yet to experience that through 3 clients totaling over 2,000 users. So until that happens, happy wallpaper changing. Personally I think that’s an HR issue rather than an IT issue. If they’re going to be inappropriate with a desktop wallpaper, odds are that’s the least offensive thing they do in the office.

Now we do set branding on newly imaged machine and a lot of users just don’t bother. But the few who do stare at their screen performing monotonous tasks for 40 hours a week enjoy the ever-so-small slice of peace looking at a picture of their kids or vacation spot as they switch between windows and tasks."
