depression,ffhi5rv,t3_etkvgj,1579936319.0,"oh no i'm so sorry, this made me so sad to read and i'm just gonna put some thoughts down because i am so mad at this guy

* whatever he said about your appearance is his subjective opinion - it just means you're not his type. some people like big noses, some like small noses, whatever, there's something out there for everyone and you shouldn't take his preferences into account because they're just that, his preferences and nothing more
* beyond that, it's shitty to say that to anyone - i'd never tell any of my friends that they're unattractive, i'm their friend because i see all the good things in their personalities and love them as they are so if this guy is truly your friend he shouldn't be saying such hurtful things to you
* so your personality's not attractive \*to him\*, who cares? he doesn't sound like a catch himself, i wouldn't date someone who treats their friends like this
* and about your clothes - please correct me if i'm misgendering you but if you're worried about dressing too masculine then i'm assuming you're a girl? my opinion doesn't matter here either but personally, i'm a girl and i think girls who dress on the masculine side are hot as fuck, i've never seen an exception to that, and ik there are guys out there who agree with that too so whatever/whoever you're into, you deserve to find someone who likes you the way you are
* people have glow ups all the time, you haven't peaked yet don't worry
* also i think i'm ugly and unattractive af most of the time, but i also just had the thought that i've never seen someone else irl and went ""wow they're so ugly"" - at worst, they just look like a regular person and i'm not personally attracted to them, but i've never thought anyone looked bad. chances are no one else is thinking that about you either
* i know what it feels like to not be liked by anyone, it really really sucks and i wish i had better advice for dealing with it. please just know that you are enough and that you're very strong for having any clean streak of cutting in the first place - relapses happen and you can't blame yourself for them. over time, the clean streaks will get longer. keep going, you got this and i hope you feel better soon, sending hugs <3"
