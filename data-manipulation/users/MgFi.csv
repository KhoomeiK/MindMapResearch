AskReddit,ff9i2yj,t1_ff9c1c5,1579713484.0,"Local issues have a way of becoming national or global, if they affect enough people.  Water supply isn't a problem where I live, either, but I'm guessing that a not-insignificant portion of my food supply is reliant on water from the Ogallala Aquifer or the Colorado river.  There are millions of people in south and southeast Asia relying on water from disappearing glaciers in the Himalayas, or water that is being diverted within China instead of leaving the country.  There are millions of wells tapping aquifers around the world that are not replenishing fast enough to be sustainable water sources, and that water is largely being used to grow food.

If you haven't heard of it before, go read about the Aral Sea.  It was once the fourth largest lake in the world (by surface area), and easily identifiable on every map of the globe.  It's essentially gone now.  The water that fed it was redirected into irrigation works in the desert.  Its disappearance has changed the local climate, destroyed ways of life, and literally changed the map of the world."
AskReddit,ff9gf7h,t1_ff9bwti,1579712466.0,"You are correct in an absolute sense, but the problem is a relative one.  The real concern is the availability of potable fresh water at an affordable price in the locations people are currently living.  Los Angeles has plenty of water available, the only problem is that it's mostly in the ocean.  Desalinating water is much more expensive (and energy intensive) than using water from a local aquifer or the aqueducts that have been built.  If the aquifer becomes depleted and/or the aqueducts become oversubscribed, you now have a shortage of potable fresh water.

In other places it can be much worse than that.  If the river your city has relied upon for hundreds or thousands of years is itself fed by glaciers that are shrinking, you're going to have increasing water shortages as those glaciers disappear.

Sure, water is not created or destroyed, but it can be polluted, shipped away (in the form of agricultural products), or evaporated away (by the acres upon acres of whatever it is you're growing in the desert).  While the water still exists in these cases, it is now much harder to access and/or consume (safely)."

RedditForGrownups,fdjukfa,t1_fdjr8am,1578487986.0,"I wasn't even thinking about waking up to care for the baby when I wrote my response above. My first guess would be to agree to take turns somehow.

As far as adopting a schedule (for him) goes, I think the important part is the structure rather than holding firm to set times. More like, ""when I wake up, I take my meds, shower, eat breakfast, do the dishes, take out the trash if it needs it, etc."" regardless of what time of day that happens at.

I can see why this is all coming to a head now, but that also makes this the worst time to be trying to tackle his challenges too. Everything is harder when you've got a small child to care for.  On the bright side, any kind of schedule you can adopt that involves the child is likely to benefit the child too.

One other thing you can attempt is accepting the negative emotions but letting them pass.  Easier said than done, I know, especially when you're tired yourself. Once you've got a plan, be ready to expect it to break, iterate on it until something is working, and persevere emotionally so long as you can rationally assess that progress is happening.

RedditForGrownups,fdhmrq2,t3_elaszy,1578425950.0,"Most people are going to tell you: you can't change another person, run!  However, I'll run with the idea that he really wants to change, and simply needs help, and that you're willing to put in a significant effort yourself so long as progress is being made.

To recap: He has mental health issues, works ""gig style"" jobs that allow a casual style which probably  provide him with an irregular income stream and an irregular daily schedule, and has never had a solid reason to change the way he dresses or grooms.

It's good that he's working on the mental health issues.  Only he can really process all of that.  The best you can do is support him however you can as he works through it all.  The fact that he's willing to go to therapy suggests that he wants to change, which offers a sign of hope.

The trouble is he's got a lot of changes to integrate into his life in relatively short order if he wants to start making a net contribution to your family, and that's going to be difficult.

Getting onto a regular daily schedule could help with a lot of this.  If he can start waking up at the same time everyday, and then have a list of things to pay attention to in order, that can turn a lot of what you expect from him into habits.  Wake up, take meds, bathe and groom, do some dishes, take out the trash, etc.  That can all be turned into a regular daily routine, and you can mark progress on how well he's adopting that routine.  It should also help his mental health to have more structure in his day.

The gig work, which I'm guessing happens mostly at night, is going to conflict with establishing a schedule.  You'll have to figure out a way to support him adopting as regular a schedule as possible in light of this.

The same thing applies to his finances, really.  If he has an irregular income, it must make planning very difficult for him.  The best way I can think of to tackle this is to keep track of what he makes over a ""representative"" period of time, and then use that to estimate his monthly income.  Then I would help him create a budget based on 50-80% of that number, and a plan to save the rest in order to smooth out his income stream.  This will probably be a work-in-progress for quite a while, but you should be able to gradually add structure and predictability if he's really on board with the idea.  I'm guessing you'd probably have to come up with the structure for him, and sit down with him periodically to apply and adapt it until it becomes regular and/or familiar enough to him for him to work with it on his own.

As for acquiring different skills... you could start helping him learn to cook.  Pick a couple of simple dishes and write out or find a recipe for him to follow.  Let him practice those dishes a few times before adding new ones.  I have a similar struggle with my SO, who has no interest in cooking.  One way we work through it is by periodically ordering meal kits which take a lot of the beguiling variables out of the process for her.  The kit has exactly what she needs and a recipe that only calls for what's in the kit.  This allows her to get used to the process of cooking without having to worry about grocery shopping, keeping track of ingredients, measuring, etc.  Over time her confidence in the kitchen has been growing.  My assumption (and goal) is that someday she'll get more comfortable cooking without the ""training wheels"" on.

Beard trimming is just another skill, from this perspective.  I'm guessing there must be plenty of YouTube videos out there on beard trimming that he could watch."
