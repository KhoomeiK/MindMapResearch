3 separate rate increases in the last 5 months alone totalling more than $30 per month, while the channel package lost 2 channels.

1 phantom bill for over $30 for 17 hours of porn nobody could possibly have watched because nobody was home that day.  That took 3 phone calls and over two hours of my time to get reversed.

Absolutely no way to watch any sports from this state or any neighboring states, pro or college, without paying almost $200 a month.

Tried to help someone sign up for basic internet (no streaming, just enough to get email at home without cellular data).  First they lied, said there were no plans under 100 mbps available for $80 before fees.  Then, when pressed about affordable internet requirements under federal law, they came down to 20 mbps for $50 before fees.

But hey, their customer service folks are professional and courteous now as they laboriously explain for the 10th time (but in perfect, un-accented English, unlike years ago) that neither they nor their supervisors nor their supervisors have any authority whatsoever to do a damned thing about how expensive and outage-prone their service is.

Oh, and the 100 mbps service has never, ever, even once, shown up as higher than 70 mbps on a speed test while we had it... except on [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net), which Comcast owns.  Al the others top out at precisely half that, every day, except during prime time (6 pm - 9 pm), when it's even slower.

Their bills went up almost $30 in the last 5 months alone, in two separate increases (one for the package, and one for the fees).  And they LOST two channels.

Because they need internet access (who doesn't? everyone needs email & Google) and a phone, and their building is Comcast-only, they must pay nearly $200 a month if they want to watch any local sports at all.  There's ZERO sports at all in any channel package below the 3rd tier up from basic.  They will not offer any internet speed lower than 100 mbps if you are buying other services.

But mundanity, for lack of a better term, isn't desirable for its own sake.  As you say, real life is relentlessly, unavoidably so already.  But mundanity, in moderation, creates relatability, a world you can understand and feel like you belong immersed within.  It creates conflict, because all problems can't just be ""magic-ed"" away.  And it throws actual fantastic elements into relief, enhancing their effect.  I'd argue that lightning trains, magic robots, dinosaurs, and everything else at once in Eberron, in a nominally sword-and-sorcery setting dilutes the effect of all of it, generating yawns rather than smiles.

Let's take a look at a truly far-out, fantastic setting: Dark Sun.  I was once so in love with the fact that all domestic animals in the setting are unique.  There are no horses, no cows, no chickens, pigs, goats, etc.  They're extinct, if they ever existed.  Better yet, there are no direct analogues for them, only approximate ones.

I tried to do that in a more conventional setting once, and my players hated it.  It wasn't relatable.  Riding a featherless ostrich or giant ant in a desert setting seemed to fit, but missing horses & cattle & dogs in a different setting made it unrelatable, even though there were analogues thereof.

So, context clearly matters.  Mundane vs. Fantastic isn't a straight-line spectrum, with a ""good"" and and a ""bad"" end, if I'm honest.  But neither is pumping one or the other way up to an extreme good in and of itself."

Garden-variety shale, limestone or sandstone that's easily mined and sculpted isn't going to stand up to even one strong guy with a good, steel pickaxe for very long.  Granite or marble, on the other hand, are very hard and will just get chipped, giving the golem plenty of time to strangle the guy.  Or several guys.

If the golem is animated entirely by magic, being one solid piece, it's essentially a question of ""how long to break this rock into small enough chunks?""  If it's more of a stone ""mannequin"", with moving joints and parts, then those points are vulnerable just like they would be on a living creature.  Even if you can't ""kill"" it, they can immobilize or cripple it by applying force or leverage to those spots any way they can.

How do the golem's senses work?  Does it have eyes that can be blinded?  Does it even hear?  Does it see people by their ""aura"" or like a human sees?

Lastly, there's trickery.  A man-sized statue (or ""mannequin"") made of solid stone is going to weigh more than a ton.  Mud, sand, and silt could be used to trap it.

Bedbugs,ffe13mf,t3_et0y7k,1579833972.0,"Bed bug bites are localized immune responses all but identical to those from Mosquitoes or other bloodsucking insects (as opposed to Spiders and other venomous ones).  They can vary greatly in severity and take up to several days to fully appear, and several more to fade, depending on irritation and scratching which can prolong that.

The most common reaction is none at all.  Over half the population isn't allergic to any detectible degree to the bed bugs' anticoagulant saliva.  There are no marks, no noticeable wound, no lump or welt, no discoloration, and no irritation or pain.

The next most common reaction is about what most people suffer from a mosquito.  After 12 to 24 hours, the welt and itching become noticeable, and fade after 1-2 days.

Some people, less commonly, may notice bites immediately upon waking, or not for almost a week.  Very rarely, some individuals may react very strongly to the allergy, which can result in very pronounced rash, weeping sores, and severe skin irritation, secondary skin infections from scratching, or even localized necrosis if those infections go untreated.

The best thing you can do to check for bed bugs is inspect your mattress, box spring, and behind the headboard weekly for bugs, shells, or black residue spots that smear reddish-brown when rubbed with a wet cloth.  Other common sign locations are behind hanging pictures or curtains by the bed, and baseboards.  And, of course, bedding, pillows, pillowcases, etc.  If you inspect these areas carefully for 8 weeks straight and find nothing even remotely suspicious, you almost certainly do not have bed bugs."

Many Americans of all walks of life (except the rich, of course) find many obstacles to voting, including onerous Voter ID requirements.  As I explained above, it's usually not about whether ID is required - it almost always is, in some form - but which, specific forms of paperwork are required, and that those are chosen specifically to target voters who may not know or do not have the resources (free time, money, information) to get them.  This is on top of voting itself being a one-day affair with crowded and inconveniently located or sparse polling places, especially in poor inner cities, long lines and other obstacles that, in the end, prevent poor people from voting as a statistic.

If you have to choose between keeping your job and voting, illegal as that is, you are going to choose your job, especially as a member of the working poor.

True, as I said in my original post, anything is safe IF you do your homework and pay heed to safe handling.  There's a big difference between hosing down your sandals that you wear barefoot right before heading out the door vs. a very light spritz to your work shoes with which you wear socks, before you go to bed and which you won't wear until tomorrow morning.  That first example's definitely not going to be good for you, especially repetitively.

Bedbugs,ffa5lxw,t1_ffa4u2q,1579728339.0,"Technically anything is safe if you understand how to use it and use safe practices.  Supposedly dish soap dissolved in water works just fine as a temporary repellent, which is all you're trying to do.  Full disclosure: I've never used it, but I've spoken to exterminators who say it does work like that.  You're not going to kill anything by spraying anyway (they're hidden inside the shoe, under the insole, between stitching, inside the tongue, etc., if they're in there).  They won't get hit, but they will dislike the smell and get out within a day.  They just come right back if you don't keep spraying.  The purpose of spraying shoes is to not carry them outside and spread them around.  It's not particularly useful for other parts of the home.

What I have used is ordinary pesticide (Steri-Fab), and rubbing alcohol (70%).  In the U.S., any pesticide that will kill a bed bug on contact (and, therefore, work as a temporary repellent if sprayed near them, for about 12-24 hours, driving them out of the item) will mention bed bugs explicitly on the label.  If it doesn't, it won't work.  There will be no difference between brands or formulations for this purpose.

As for alcohol, it's highly discouraged because it's flammable. You're basically dousing your possessions in accellerant.  One space heater in the wrong spot and you're burning your house down.  It's safe as long as you pay attention, don't over-spray (a little goes a long way, for repellent purposes - remember you aren't killing anything), and keep the shoes well away from heat and flame.

If you're under treatment, it's a good idea to keep your shoes off the floor and outside your bedroom as far as you can manage.  Spray them every day, inside and out with soapy water or garden-variety pesticide (rated for bed bugs) to keep them from nesting in there.

If you're exposed outside your home, either do the same and leave them outdoors (no balconies, windowsills, etc. - on the ground or on furniture that's on the ground) for 24 hours, or run them through the clothes dryer on hot for a full hour.  That last might be destructive to many shoes' glue and stitching, so be careful.

Garlic and onion are the most commonly applied flavorings in most cuisines I know, and you can substitute with sweet onion, shallots, scallions, or even leeks or, at worst, parsley in many dishes.

It's important to realize that most things do benefit from some small amount of salt & pepper, which is why they're there..  Eggs are a great example of this.  Tracking your salt will make you feel less anxious.  The table / kosher salt you add when cooking is actually the hardest to really estimate, for me.  1 teaspoon of table salt has roughly the full daily recommended allowance of sodium for an adult.  But a teaspoon full of salt is quite a lot in terms of cooking.  Imagine how long you'd have to shake your shaker into a funnel to fill a 1 tsp measuring spoon.

For eggs, I recommend capsaicin.  Hot sauce is marvelous.  Read the label, as for anything, to make sure you're not also adding more salt, or that you ease up on what you normally add if there is significant sodium in the hot sauce you like.  Alternatively, use actual peppers if that's your jam.

I rarely salt vegetables I make because I usually involve salted butter.  At least you know what that ends up being at 100 mg sodium per tablespoon (1/8 stick, about 2x what most people consider a ""pat"").

In the end, you'll have to google some recipes for flavor profiles.  Some are obvious, some aren't.  For example, garlic & onion are fairly generic & show up in a lot of widely different cuisines.  Oregano & basil form an ""Italian"" profile.  Rosemary & sage often show up together, as do Rosemary and Thyme.  Cumin and Paprika are often underappreciated as well.

Wait until you have to cook for someone with an Allium intolerance on a very-low-salt restriction and a WASP retiree's disdain for ""spicy"" anything.

Oh, yeah, they were completely wrong and just gatekeeping bullies picking a fight.  Now I remember.

As far as your post goes, I find that since no random drop buffs, including CBL, do anything about the Last Cookie Problem - how the final upgrade in a holiday set has a greatly diminished chance of appearing because if you ""roll"" one you already have, you must wait for your next drop and roll again - it takes no more than half, and often much more than half the amount of time to do it with CBL as without.  And in that time, you can make a lot more progress and get more stuff done, depending on what you're after, if you have your Prestige bonus unlocked.

With CBL, you blaze through all but 1 or 2 of the upgrades each holiday... then wait for many hours for the last 1 or 2 to drop.  Without CBL, you have a more sedate pace early on, but the whole array of drops for each holiday only takes slightly longer to complete.  So, in that sense, it doesn't seem to be doing what it appears to be designed to do.  It's not CBL's fault, though; it's just a random drop buff like any other.  It's because the holiday drops are not built like the News Ticker Fortunes to adjust probabilities to account for what you have already unlocked.  It's really baffling why Orteil doesn't fix that, given that he's acknowledged it's a problem on this sub,years ago, and clearly has a solution given that it doesn't affect the Fortunes at all.

The others are right, though.  It can't hurt for garden upgrades.  Unfortunately for me, I decided the garden wasn't fun and stopped at my 2nd seed log just before CBL was added."

In a less-than-modern setting (i.e., no firearms or explosives), airships will pretty much be permanently out of range of any offensive weaponry, and be devilishly difficult to board via another ship or balloon.  In other words, they're about as safe from banditry and piracy as possible.  Between that and time savings, it's still going to be cheaper for some classes of goods, at least, than overland transport.  Civilization grows via water transport - ports and navigable rivers.  Conquering the sky means there's a river everywhere, and any place, even the most remote outpost, can be a port of call.

The downside is that they're likely to be expensive to maintain (ordinary sailing ships are, in their own time, and they don't require specialized lift gas or fuel for hot air).  They're also much more vulnerable to weather.  A seagoing ship with a competent captain can furl sails, batten down hatches, and ride out all but the worst storms, with onboard carpenters to replace damaged masts & spars.  An airship will just crash, and it won't take that much of a storm to do it.  Weather will also play havoc with schedules.

If you're not talking about moving freight, observation (spy ships, artillery spotting or scouting for armies) and bombing (from safely out of range of anything nasty they could shoot up at you) are also priceless features of flying craft of any sort.  And airships have the lift capacity to become bombers even without explosives.

So, I guess one requirement is ""good weather"".  Ultimately, those concerns - the ability to keep schedules, maintain safety, or operate military craft reliably in bad weather - are what sunk airships in reality."

aldi,ff4jbdf,t3_erl10j,1579564979.0,"This is widely acknowledged to be how Wal-Mart gets their unbelievably low prices.  If you shop broadly there, you run into things that are slightly or sometimes even greatly more expensive than they should be, individually.  They pick these items strategically.  The unusual flavor of pickles you like may be way cheaper there, but milk, eggs, bread, and other staples will be a few pennies more, and really popular odds and ends like Hershey's Syrup and cleaning products and whatnot will be significantly more expensive.  The better it sells, the more likely it is to be not as cheap as you'd expect, as far as I can tell.  Not to mention how lackadaisically they restock shelves.  Any deal worth buying empties out instantly and isn't restocked all damned week it seems, leaving you to either buy the more expensive stuff next to it, go to another store, or go without.

The problem with comparing them is that there are things I have literally never, ever seen at any of the 3 Aldis within 30 minutes of my home.  Ground pork, soda other than standard Coke (not that anyone should be a big soda drinker, but heaven forbid someone's sick and you want basic ginger ale...), family-size teabags for brewing quarts of iced tea, pork roasts - heck, beef roasts for that matter - whole poultry, all-beef hot dogs, mozzarella cheese (of all things), and many others.  Aldi simply does not carry enough variety of products, let alone any kind of choice for any given product if you don't like or can't use the single choice offered, to shop only there.

I value the place greatly, I don't know how I'd survive without it... but it absolutely necessitates shopping in at least one additional store, for a different reason but otherwise exactly how Wal-mart does.  Not that they're the only two, TBH.  You basically get squeezed and gouged if you only shop at one market in the 21st Century U.S.  Adam Smith must be twirling in his grave.

budgetfood,ff34r05,t3_er2zsi,1579533643.0,"TL;DR: steam in a covered pan, on any sort of burner, on medium heat, half-covered with salted water.  Root and dense veggies like potatoes, carrots, etc. might do better mostly-covered in water (3/4, let's say) and with no lid, on medium-high heat.

Why?  I discovered this when learning to cook carrots - fresh ones, but hear me out.  Lots of people are sensitive to the condition of cooked carrots.  They're often overcooked and mushy, among other things.  A recipe suggested this method and it works great on sliced, raw carrots.

What's that got to do with frozen veggies?  Well, you nuke them directly, they get mushy.  You steam them - in the microwave or in a double-boiler - and they get mushy.  What to do?  I love broccoli, for example, but it is HIDEOUSLY expensive to buy fresh, not available in convenient quantities, and requires a fair amount of work on top of all that.  Usually stuff you need 30 minutes with a knife to prep is cheaper (i.e. whole carrots, for example), but not Broccoli for some reason.

So I get frozen broccoli, but it's always limp and soft no matter what you do.  So I tried the pan method for carrots with it.  Works great!  If you low-ball the water, all you end up doing is getting a little browning, which may not look great but tastes fine as long as you don't burn them.  For broccoli, I didn't thaw ahead of time, but it might do to allow that for some things; you'll have to experiment."

cookingforbeginners,ff19hvn,t1_feys2a1,1579476539.0,"It still depends on what you're freezing.  Some things handle the inevitable tissue damage better than others.  A steak will always come out better than strawberries, 1st time or re-frozen.  Generally things that are pretty far broken down - soups, stews, etc. - freeze excellently and you can't really tell they were frozen after cooking.  Something like fish, which will survive freezing before cooking, probably wouldn't do well being frozen afterwards.  It'll still be safe as long as you follow food safety guidelines about leaving it out at room temp, but it may not be tasty or good-looking amymore.

Generally speaking, you want to fight freezerburn, and the best way to do that is to keep as much air out of the item or its container as possible.  Water vapor in the air is where the frost comes from, and that's what damages and adds wateriness to defrosted food."

A lot of Japanese traditional breakfasts involve unusually-seasoned, foam-brick-like omelettes, though they can be challenging to make if you aren't used to them (and I have no advice on that score; I've seen & eaten them, but not cooked them).  Also various preparations of rice, pickles, veggies & seasonings with a raw egg tempered in while still piping hot (and therefore cooked within the rice), appear to be common, from what I can see as a Yankee who hasn't been to Japan, at any rate.

I know fish is a big part of breakfast in Scandinavia (in the words of Mel Brooks, ""many different Herrings""), but I don't know more than that.  It's another place to look.

Personally, I don't mind traditional cereal (sometimes; it gets old fast), and my favorite breakfast is still ""country style"" scrambled eggs, with sausage, hash browns, and cheese (traditionall onions & peppers, but I usually skip those) mixed directly in while cooking the eggs.  Of course, over-easy with toast dipped into the runny yolks is a special treat, since I can never seem to get the eggs right myself; the yolks always get too done by the time the whites are remotely edible.

I was raised on a diet of toast with peanut butter because we were dirt poor and that's about as fortifying of a breakfast (protein & carbs, relatively little sugar or bad fats) that you can get and eat warm for under $1 per serving.  I find myself gravitating back to that if I'm in a hurry or don't have motivation to make something else.  A very poorly provisioned hotel breakfast at one point taught me that peanut butter goes very well on toasted bagels, of all kinds, as well.  Of course, if you're in Europe this is going to be Nutella, but other than the higher sugar content, there's nothing wrong with that."

There's a lot of leeway and variation in this dish, but the essence of it is:

* Mashed potatoes, plus
* Onion & celery, finely diced and sauteed in (a generous amount of) butter
* Breadcrumbs, toasted in butter
* Mixed / blended together, then baked @ 350 until the top crusts over
* Rough porportions:  3lb potatoes to 1 cup (each) chopped onion & celery, at least 1/2 lb butter (plus some for the veggies & bread), 4-6 slices of bread (stale & crushed into crumbs) or 1-2 cups breadcrumbs.

Things I recommend are:

1. Peel your potatoes unless they're Yukon Gold.  Normally I don't but you don't want to see skins in this dish.
2. The finer you dice (or even use a food processor on) the onion & celery, the less you'll need to apply a mixer or blender afterward.  More smoothly mashed potatoes cut down on this, too.  You can eliminate it altogether if your veggies are very finely chopped & potatoes are pretty smooth.
3. Extra milk and especially butter help a lot.  You should put twice as much butter in this as you would if you were making regular mashed potatoes (accounting for what you put in the mashed potatoes, to begin with, of course, but not for what you apply to the veggies & breadcrumbs.
4. Scallions are even better in this dish than regular onions.
5. Parsley and sage are optional but nice additions, to taste.

I am no giant fan of either onion or celery.  But I gotta tell you, this dish has a unique flavor all its own and is very delicious.  Nothing quite like it.  Everyone should try it at least once."
