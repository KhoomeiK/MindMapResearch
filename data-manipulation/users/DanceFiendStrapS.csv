MurderedByWords,fggelab,t3_ey3xk8,1580760239.0,"I will forever keep saying it until it comes into fruition. Unless your child is immunocompromised or *actually* allergic to a vaccine, if you don't vaccinate them you should be charged with child abuse. If your child infects someone immunocompromised and they die, they should be charged with manslaughter.

They don't care about someone who has no immune system coming into contact with their unvaccinated child. They wouldn't feel remorse if that person contracted the disease or even died because of their fucking stupid decisions. Fuck pro-plaguers."
