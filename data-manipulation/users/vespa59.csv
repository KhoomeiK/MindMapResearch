It is true that all former strippers are married to absolute pieces of shit. They don’t even *have* parents to try to impress with the caliber of partner they managed to land!

Grow up, dipshit. It’s a job, like any other. You sell a little part of yourself for money. We all do it; some of us are just a little more realistic about what the transaction is."

By the time it arrived I was starving and so stoked for this delicious chicken (seriously, Bae's chicken in Portland is BOMB) but as soon as the guy took the box out of his delivery bag I knew. Thankfully the chicken and the waffle fries got away untainted, but the texas toast was a 50% loss and the rest of the meal was a little less awesome just from having associated with those disgusting green fuckers."

They’ll match you with someone in a similar situation and the that person’s donor will get matched to someone else, and so on until your recipient gets theirs. A couple of years ago I introduced a friend who was interested in donating but had no recipient to another friend who was on dialysis. Less than a year later they each had a functioning kidney, as did another dozen or so people in the chain."

Plus, the fact that you got fined so hard you had to pull out of the EU is gonna ruin a lot of what you have left. You’re fucked and you damn well should be. It’s not impossible to take care of peoples personally information. For a lot of incidents, it’s a matter of slowing your growth a bit to invest in good security infrastructure and people.

AskReddit,fdff55q,t1_fdex67r,1578360244.0,"I once had to follow a cop to the hospital on my motorcycle (it was a motorcycle cop) after a friend of mine crashed and was taken there. After we moved her bike to the side of the road he asked me if I knew where I was going and I said, ""not quite, can I follow you?"" 

He replied, ""heh, sure, if you can keep up!""

Holy shit. I knew motorcycle cops could ride but this guy was fucking nuts. We definitely busted 100 mph a couple of times in Sunday freeway traffic and at one point we were lane splitting through stopped cars at like 80. It must have looked absolutely bananas to see a regular person on a black Triumph tailing a cop on a 1200cc BMW police bike like a reverse action movie chase scene. 

When we rolled up to the hospital he gave me props for not losing him or my life and then, really concerned, asked me if my GoPro was running for that ride. Unfortunately, the battery had died earlier in the day and I got none of it. He was like, ""if this shows up on YouTube I'm coming for you."""
