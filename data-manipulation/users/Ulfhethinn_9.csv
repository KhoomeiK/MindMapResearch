Lean forward as you do it. Lean as far forward as you can. You don't want to be upright, or god forbid, leaning back.

Keep your feet pointing down, ready to catch yourself on your toes, like you would when sprinting.

Take jumping steps backwards, one foot before the other, and catch yourself a few steps down with your hands and feet, and remember to fall forward as you jump back. Keep doing this until you can effectively jump back two or three steps and safely catch yourself.

When you feel secure, try chaining these leaps into each other without pausing. After you've got that sorted, you can CAREFULLY, try it without hands. Go slowly at first, and think about what you're doing and how you can do it better and safer.

With practice, I'm sure you can do it, but it won't be easy! It took you more than a year to learn running forwards on flat ground, and this is way harder!

LearnUselessTalents,fen1ru1,t3_emfdbw,1579275048.0,"Keep your arms at chest height and be ready to protect your head if it comes to it. If you fall, you only want to think about protecting your head.

Lean forward as you do it. Lean as far forward as you can. You don't want to be upright, or god forbid, leaning back.

Keep your feet pointing down, ready to catch yourself on your toes, like you would when sprinting.

Take jumping steps backwards, one foot before the other, and catch yourself a few steps down with your hands and feet, and remember to fall forward as you jump back. Keep doing this until you can effectively jump back two or three steps and safely catch yourself.

When you feel secure, try chaining these leaps into each other without pausing. After you've got that sorted, you can CAREFULLY, try it without hands. Go slowly at first, and think about what you're doing and how you can do it better and safer.

With practice, I'm sure you can do it, but it won't be easy! It took you more than a year to learn running forwards on flat ground, and this is way harder!

If you get it down, post a video somewhere and tag me in the comments! I absolutely want to see this shit!"

After practicing your ""new voice"" for a while, would you say it actually becomes your voice? Do you now naturally speak in your desired feminine voice?

Basically, I want to know if it's possible to change how I naturally talk. Say, one year from now, can I talk the way I'd like to without really thinking about it?"
