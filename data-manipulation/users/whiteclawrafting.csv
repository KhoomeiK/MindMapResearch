Divorce,ff7aq0y,t1_ff7adxr,1579644844.0,"Thank you for saying that, that's very kind of you. And I have often wanted to ask my ex that, but I also have to live with the fact that what's done is done and I may never have all the answers I want. Ultimately, we were two people who probably should have never gotten married, and our relationship was not healthy in many ways. I completely agree with you, I think divorce should be an absolute last resort, barring abuse of course."
Divorce,ff79mu5,t1_ff78d1h,1579643966.0,"1. I'll fully admit I was much more passive than I should have been. I was young and insecure. Suffering from depression doesn't help either, instead of standing up for myself I internalized everything.

2. Honestly, nothing. I know that now. I didn't know that then.

3. Not that it really matters, but I was not the one who initiated the divorce, my ex did. So I didn't ""leave without standing up for myself"" in that sense. But yes, I am scared of it happening again. That's why a year later I'm still single and am currently in therapy to work on those issues. I want to make sure I don't make the same mistakes."
Divorce,ff6fgdj,t1_ff5in5j,1579626040.0,"From a standpoint of my core values, those have not changed. My ideals, political beliefs, morals etc have all stayed the same. But as far as what I like to do and what types of things interest me. When you're in a relationship, you make compromises, and it's possible I made far too many. I would feel guilty watching certain shows or listening to certain music because my ex thought they were stupid or childish. I didn't get to do a lot of the activities or events that sounded interesting to me because he thought they were silly. So now I'm getting out, I'm doing those things. I also struggled with depression, and during my marriage I let it consume me, to the point where I wouldn't go out and try new things. I'm doing that now too, and I'm learning I like a lot of things I thought I'd hate, and vice versa."
Divorce,ff4tvpn,t3_ermx0z,1579572334.0,"For me it's been about rediscovering myself.  I lost a lot of who I was in my marriage, and while it's been scary and at times crushingly lonely, it's been a lot of fun figuring out who I am on my own. I'm learning a lot about myself, and in that I'm learning to be comfortable being alone. Do I want companionship again at some point? Absolutely. But I want to make sure I'm in a good headspace first. I want to get into a relationship because I want *that* specific person, not because I just want *someone*."
StLouis,ff4t2zk,t3_ern8ow,1579571783.0,"I'm confused. Is this man claiming to HAVE a 36 your old woman at his home, or is he claiming to BE a 36 year old woman? Because one of those is a serious crime, and the other sounds like either some type of mental illness or some guy wanting to play out a rape fantasy."
StLouis,ff0pkp6,t1_ff0b0wa,1579471076.0,"How does this make him a douche?  Pretty much every athlete has cities they don't want to play for or move to.  Heck, most people in general have places they don't want to go."
Divorce,fepfh8m,t1_fep7vx9,1579319188.0,"Sure. One thing my therapist does a lot for me is ask me ""why"". If I tell her that something makes me sad, or that I feel guilty, she asks me questions to help identify where those feelings are stemming from or to try and explain the feeling beyond just a word. One thing specifically she's having me do is when I have those emotions - sadness, anger, loneliness, guilt - to learn to identify them, put a name to them, and to figure out what it means to ""sit"" in those feelings instead of pushing them away, which I tend to do. Journaling has been very helpful for me too, writing out my thoughts and what's going through my head, which also gives me something concrete to bring with me to therapy. Another thing my therapist has been helpful with is challenging the way I talk to and about myself. I tend to put myself down and she's been working with me to focus on the language I use when I talk about myself. She's given me some book suggestions as well, although most of them have been relating to my issues with my parents and not my marriage. I hope this made some sense, if you have more questions please don't hesitate to PM me!"
Divorce,feo19wd,t3_eq5x39,1579293715.0,"I've been in therapy almost weekly since September.  I feel like it's been helpful.  I still have a ways to go and things I want to work on, but I've noticed progress. A big piece is being willing, and then actually doing, the work on your own. My therapist has been immensely helpful in giving a different perspective, challenging my patterns and thought processes, and giving me things to work on. But none of that would make a difference if I didn't go home and try to implement it on my own. It can also take a while to find a therapist who fits your needs. If this is the first therapist you've worked with, I recommend searching for someone else before throwing in the towel entirely. I know it can be very discouraging and frustrating, but when you find the right therapist it makes a world of difference."
Divorce,fekcr33,t3_epmpa7,1579197324.0,"He's looking for a concrete reason, and one that absolves him of any wrongdoing. It's easier to play the innocent victim than admit you played a part in the downfall of your marriage."
Letterkenny,fehvpv3,t3_ep4796,1579124815.0,"Pretty much anything Shoresy says, but these are my faves:

Fuck you Jonesy! Your mom shot cum straight across the room and killed my Siamese fighting fish. Threw off the pH levels in my aquarium you piece of shit.

Hey, can I have your address? I'll put a little note in the mail, remind you how fuckin' useless you are.… Can I grab your email? Oh, I'll just get it from your mom."
StLouis,fehu270,t3_ep8m4b,1579123872.0,"I was lucky enough to have gotten through for tickets to the watch party at Enterprise. It was such an awesome experience to be there. The energy was insane, it felt like you were at the game. And the energy after the Blues won was almost indescribable. People were going nuts. Lines of people giving high fives to strangers in the concourse, lots and lots of tears, and the line for merchandise was so long. Even the energy outside around the arena was amazing. It was the first time I had ever seen or experienced anything like that before, and it happened to be my birthday which made it extra special!"

Divorce,febsrl9,t3_eoct1x,1578962247.0,"I would interpret this as any bonuses you get in the future, anything after the date the divorce was official. Just to be safe if you still have your lawyers contact info I'd double check with them."
stlouisblues,fe9w2p0,t3_eo7o9a,1578941940.0,"It really just depends on the game. Most, if not all, of what's available online are resale tickets. I would not bet on them having tickets available directly from the arena."
StLouis,fe6jlgf,t1_fe69pcd,1578893009.0,Those photos are stunning! Thank you for sharing.
Divorce,fe0lbwd,t1_fe0j6hk,1578815473.0,"Wow. That last sentence really hit me. There were so many lies from my ex, about everything. Even when I confronted him with evidence of his emotional affair, he still lied to my face. What makes me think he would be honest with me now?

And you're absolutely right, just because we want answers doesn't mean we them. That's something I'm working to accept with the help of a therapist.

Congratulations on your engagement! That's wonderful news. It's nice to see someone who didn't become jaded about marriage because of divorce. A lot of people on this sub have a ""never again"" mentality, which is valid, but it's refreshing to hear a different story."
Divorce,fe0ees3,t3_enjixk,1578811825.0,"There's no hard and fast rule about dating after divorce, and everyone deals with divorce differently. The separation is still very fresh and at this point most people are just trying to keep their heads above water at this stage.

That being said, proceed with caution. The logic behind waiting to date is to make sure you're in a good mental place to do so. It's tempting to ""get on with life"" right away, and in theory there's nothing wrong with that, but it can lead you down a path of not really dealing with the issues. Don't use dating as a distraction. That's unhealthy for you and it's unfair to the other person. And I know it's cliche, but I think there is value to learning to be comfortable being alone.

I'm sorry you're going through this. It's tough now, but it does get better."
