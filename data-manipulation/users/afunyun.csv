Insurance,ffm70by,t3_etjoau,1580049634.0,"To me it sounds like you think it's ""totaled"" but it's actually repairable. When a lot of people see significant damage, they think immediately that it's totaled. That's not the case. If the vehicle is repairable and the amount is below the ACV of the vehicle, they're going to give you the money to repair the vehicle, nothing more. 

Since this estimate was $1900, if you take it in to a shop & they tear the vehicle town & find more damage, it could potentially be totaled. But, that is not guaranteed.

I would clarify if this was an estimate or a total loss valuation. Your idea of totaled & the insurance idea of totaled are likely very different. 

I don't see how on earth an insurance company could offer $1900 for a 2013 F-150 of any trim unless it was basically destroyed prior to the accident or already was a salvage title."

Insurance,ffbsd8l,t3_ess06v,1579780922.0,"As far as the extra insurance on the rental, in some states they will pay it and in others they won't. Depends on the case law in that state. You can ask. I know if Texas for example we will not under any circumstances pay for it, but I have seen us pay it in New York. They will most likely need a copy of your current declarations page proving that you don't have comp/collision in order to pay it.

If you do change your policy then yes the rental would be covered, but keep in mind the changes typically won't go into effect until the next day so don't immediately cancel the rental insurance if you do this.

As far as the lost wages, they won't pay them. At least not for the accident itself, sorry. The only time they're going to pay lost wages is if you're missing work because you're treating an injury, or if you used your car for work and now you can't because of the accident (lost revenue). Having to miss work because you got in an accident and had to wait around at the scene, get a rental car, get your vehicle to a shop etc are not something that's reimbursed."

Insurance,fei0pm0,t1_fei0huv,1579127754.0,"No. You're being made whole by having your vehicle repaired to correct specifications & having a rental provided in the meantime to cover your loss of use. Your insurance company frankly doesn't have any interest in your ""inconvenience"" and furthermore cannot ""fight for you"" for anything beyond your vehicle repairs being reimbursed & rental reimbursed by the other insurance company. Additionally, the only reason they can ""fight for you"" for that reimbursement is because it seems you're using your collision coverage in lieu of trying to file directly with the at fault adverse carrier. If you were trying to file with them directly, your insurance company would not be able to ""fight for"" anything. Anything beyond what they're doing now, you're going to need to take it up with the other insurance company."

You can try and file a diminished value claim but with a 5 year old vehicle and minor damage, you're gonna need a good amount of supporting documentation. You can try and get a DV report from a company specializing in that, but you will have to pay for that. Is it worth it? Maybe. That's up to you. If it was a $56k suv in 2014/2015 it's probably a 20-30k vehicle at most now, so don't expect them to write you a check for 10k even with documentation."

You should both be listed drivers on both policies anyways since obviously you drive each other's vehicles so they were probably going to find it at renewal regardless. If it was at fault on your wife's end they will surcharge for it, if it wasn't, geico does not surcharge for non fault collisions.

Insurance,fduz9nj,t1_fdtlldv,1578741281.0,"Hmm yeah, those are both service letters of experience. The only thing I can think of is that they somehow didn't add the exposures up properly when creating the first one, or somehow those claims were still open and they just wrapped them up between when the got the first letter and the second, which I feel is unlikely given the dates.

Regardless if the second letter is correct unfortunately it doesn't matter if they accidentally put lower amounts on the first letter. It sucks and they definitely dropped the ball there but it doesn't change the reality of what the payouts were."
Insurance,fdt9x0r,t3_emzvs1,1578713833.0,"Geico has different letters of experience. One is a claims history letter, another is a letter of experience. The claims history letter is from the claims department and lists payouts by exposure, not by total claim amount. This means they have to manually add each exposure, so the collision would be one entry, property damage another, rental another etc and they would all show on different lines. 

I think what happened to you is that the first one was a claims history letter, not a letter of experience, and whoever sent it out from the claim department mistakenly did not include all exposures on the claims, artificially lowering the amounts shown on the letter. 

The second one is probably an actual letter of experience from the service department, which is easier to create and harder to mess up, so it is likely correct."

Put yourself in the shoes of the adjuster that's assigned to her claim. On their end, you're saying she r/e you, which makes sense. But, if you want to claim anything on anybody's policy, you must be able to prove it. If you have no proof, and they're saying something different happened, who are you going to believe? The person you're contractually bound to handle claims in good faith *(aka believing their story)* or someone else who's trying to get paid out under your claim whom you have no contract with?"
Insurance,fdkpfxt,t3_elw62z,1578508413.0,"Geico has several underwriting companies, like most large carriers. GEICO has at least 8. GEICO Choice, GEICO Indemnity, GEICO County Mutual, ETC.

They are all GEICO. The only real difference is that they all have different rating structures. A driver can be placed among each underwriting company according to their risk. Depending on your state, GEICO vs GEICO county mutual could mean they thought she was a higher risk driver or that you were, each company has their own rating structure in the state they operate in.

That being said, the UW company has absolutely 0 interest in the liability between claims. Both of your claims are being handled by GEICO corporate claims. Trust me when I say this. They treat DI (double insured claims) as if they are separate companies (regardless if you are both with GEICO, GEICO County Mutual, or different ones each). The adjuster on your claim will not be able to access the claim for the other party, just as theirs won't be able to access your claim.

To your adjuster it will be as if the other person had another insurance company, like progressive or something. It will have no bearing on their liability decision."
Insurance,fdkook8,t1_fdkjb1g,1578507957.0,"1k shy seems like they should have totaled it. Usually it's considered an assumed total if it's anywhere near that amount. The reasoning is that it's assumed there can easily be a couple hundred to 1k+ of supplemental damages in there that aren't caught initially. Do you know exactly what the dollar amount was they would've totaled it at, or are you assuming?

If it's a DRP, usually they will at least warranty the repairs. That's the main thing. I would get with the shop & them and try and get the rental covered. A lot of times they can work something out. 

Usually even if they managed to not total it before, they would just go ahead and total it now if it truly was that close to the TL threshold. I'd try and figure out what their numbers are."

Insurance,fdjpvnh,t1_fdjhco0,1578482765.0,"If the delay is on the shop then usually your auto damage adjuster can negotiate and have them pick up the rental.

And yes, by policy language, your insurance company will only cover up to 30 days, or in a lot of policies, up to a maximum amount. A lot of them arrive at 30 days by dividing the max by 30 days to give you your daily rate. Aka, if you have $1500 of rental, you have $50 per day, not to exceed $1500 total. If you have not actually hit this dollar limit, it's possible they can pay for a few extra days.

This is why when setting people up with a rental when the repair is expected to take a long time I recommend them taking the smallest rental they can, so that they don't burn through their dollar limit in the event that the repair takes longer than expected.

If you have hit the dollar limit of your rental, the insurance ***will not*** cover any more days. We call this ""extra contractual"" (meaning outside the contract language) and it is a HUGE no-no. At my company we need approval from like 6 levels up (usually the regional liability administrator) to do anything that's extra contractual. So if you've been a customer for 30 years they might consider it as a courtesy, but beyond that don't expect that. Usually the only reason an insurer pays anything extra contractual it's because they're paying punitive damages when they've lost a bad faith lawsuit, so you can imagine how hard it is to get.

Also just because the repairs are taking a long time does not make the vehicle a total. The vehicle is only totaled if the dollar amount to fix it exceeds the worth of the vehicle. Doesn't matter how extensive the repairs are unless they're the type where the vehicle is never going to be safe again, and usually you hit the dollar amount easily in those cases."

You would have gotten several written notices that your insurance would be cancelled, and the only reason you'd be unaware of that is if you didn't check your mail/email, and ignored their calls, or you didn't update your contact info with Geico.

Not surprising they would be unresponsive.
