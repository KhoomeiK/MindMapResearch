BrandNewSentence,fgmiqbd,t1_fgmhooa,1580925382.0,"That was the same argument made against women, and folks of color. They thought their judgement was bad. A lot of felons are not terrible folks, they just made a mistake."
BrandNewSentence,fgmimba,t1_fgmi1th,1580925316.0,So when they're out of prison they should get to vote?

UpliftingNews,fgmfc1s,t1_fgmf2jz,1580923388.0,"Stereotypes are not something to base judgement on. By giving fathers more time to spend with their children, they will form a closer bond with them and ultimately will be more willing to do those tasks. Financial power in a family should be split within the family."
UpliftingNews,fgmf1b1,t1_fgmeip3,1580923221.0,That's not what I asked.

YangForPresidentHQ,fgk1pbe,t1_fgjmaw8,1580855675.0,"The DNC is not a governmental organization. It's privately run entity. George Washington warned us about parties, and we didn't listen. We should really listen to warnings from presidents more often."

Looks like New Mexico doesn't require a Work Permit after the age of 16. Of course, you could talk to your school counselor, since they're the issuing authority."

politics,fggaoiu,t1_fggahmf,1580757860.0,I would be willing to pay a 45% tax rate (as an adult) if it meant all of my basic needs were covered. Finland consistently ranks high as one of the best places to live. Us Americans have become so used to our ineffective government that were surprised when government's elsewhere are an actual force for good and are effective.

MadeMeSmile,fgb39v0,t1_fgaska7,1580658124.0,"Well, there's actually a bit of be ate about this. Some argue that you should row back down through the gears and use engine braking in order to help stop. Others argue that you should use your brakes and let the car coast (which is what you should do is  emergency situations as well). It's all about wear. Do you wear out your brake pads, or you clutch & transmission forks? I'd argue that you should wear out your brake pads, as clutches and forks are more difficult to service and more expensive."
