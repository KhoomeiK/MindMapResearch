worldnews,ff9mqu5,t1_ff95bzz,1579716245.0,I filter my tap water and drink it at my house now but at my previous house it the water was absolutely disgusting even filtered. I went through hundreds of plastic water bottles and jugs there
vegan,ff6jn7e,t3_erw4r9,1579628616.0,Just say you don’t think it’s ok to kill animals and eat them but most people do
AskReddit,fetnljq,t3_eqhd7i,1579377262.0,I absolutely need caffeine even if I’ve  slept enough. I recently discovered that if I go without meat for more than 2 days I have no energy and will want to die. If I go into a building or car with electric heat my entire body will itch like I’m covered in fire ants.
AskReddit,fetmrlo,t1_fepxhdx,1579376958.0,I missed a lot of school and failed a final but I was always nice and helpful to all the teachers so they changed some numbers and let me pass
vegan,fet3xf6,t1_fet0yyt,1579371592.0,I guess this just seems more directly linked to it but you’re right there’s no difference
vegan,fet0l92,t1_fese8e5,1579370733.0,The only difference for me is that the fire could potentially drive entire species of animals to extinction or close to it. Other than that there’s no difference
vegan,feppph3,t1_fepcal8,1579327181.0,That’s completely ridiculous
videos,feotk57,t1_feojnes,1579305238.0,I love the smell
vegan,felhau2,t1_feidu9z,1579222157.0,Ducks that live in human populated areas don’t have as much food as they should because people destroyed the natural environment so I think it’s a good thing to feed animals there.
MurderedByWords,felgf5p,t3_epq2zx,1579221574.0,I don’t know why some men care if a woman has slept with other guys before them. As long as it’s not happening while we’re together I really don’t care
vegan,fek10yv,t3_epb8on,1579190305.0,I’m not a vegan but that looks delicious and I’d happily try it
depression,feisjyb,t3_ep1aaz,1579146111.0,You’re only 22 it’s ridiculous to give up at this point. You can do anything you want from this point forward. Try something new go somewhere different. You can change your life right now. If you don’t like where you are then leave. Have faith and take a leap into something new
AskReddit,feino9v,t3_ep7tm4,1579142781.0,Hurtin Inside by Bob Marley that song speaks to me like no other
todayilearned,feeej2k,t1_fedkenf,1579032115.0,That’s just what’s been preserved. I bet humans were making some form of art before that and we just don’t have it anymore
todayilearned,feeedt9,t1_feea9wd,1579032030.0,Species doesn’t really mean anything. There’s several meanings and under most of them different species can produce children
todayilearned,feeebdn,t1_fedpcpp,1579031991.0,And we maybe descended from other human species. We just don’t have samples of their dna to prove it

TheWayWeWere,fdtjw2p,t1_fdsrm9y,1578717818.0,I’m actually getting gas cheaper than they did. 2.60 here in Alabama
TheWayWeWere,fdshr43,t1_fdr0vo1,1578702981.0,What’s their other option. If you’re a poor coal farmer in a small town your only other option could be Walmart or McDonald’s where they’ll make even less money.

worldnews,fd6i94g,t1_fd5w8vb,1578191443.0,International laws don’t apply to America. We don’t allow foreign courts to prosecute Americans for war crimes
pics,fcsu213,t1_fcsjk5v,1577925108.0,A small but disturbingly large percentage of Americans do believe that. I live in Alabama and I have met several people who say it was better then for black people. Of course they’re not racist at all and are actually looking out for the blacks
worldnews,fcrqya0,t1_fcrnu1l,1577905426.0,"You could say that about literally any ideology. Libertarianism, socialism, communist, capitalism, they’re all just words people put their own meanings onto. There are a few true believers in any ideology and most people twist it to fit their own values or interests. I’m pretty religious myself but I would never want the government to enforce my views onto other people. All I want is for people to be free to do as they please without hurting others. It’s hard to put that into words and it’s obviously a lot more complicated in real life situations"

worldnews,fcrn95a,t1_fcr74ps,1577904034.0,I know a lot of people who say they’re libertarian and not one of them believe that bullshit
worldnews,fcr2ykn,t1_fcqztwd,1577896023.0,I guess if the companies were clearly advertising their meat and water as poison I would be fine with it. Obviously the government shouldn’t allow companies to sell tainted meat and water as clean. In fact I think water should be government owned and no corporations should be allowed to drill it for almost no cost and sell it back bottled. If people want to smoke crack that’s not my business. If these crackheads then go on to commit serious crimes they should be imprisoned for a long time for those crimes not for using drugs.
DunderMifflin,fcoaduk,t1_fcnuer3,1577827419.0,I don’t think he was drunk. He hit the mailbox on purpose because there was another car in the way and he didn’t care
worldnews,fco3h81,t1_fcnmfvb,1577823369.0,That won’t stop Coca Cola from drilling more and selling the water back bottled

worldnews,fcn68x7,t1_fcmw0au,1577804363.0,I don’t blame them if they can get away with it. It’s the universities who are letting them do this and still giving them diplomas
worldnews,fcjezto,t1_fciyxm0,1577685218.0,People won’t wake up and do something real until major world cities start getting evacuated. By that point it’ll be way too late

AnimalsBeingBros,fby4o3w,t1_fbxzdbe,1577208006.0,My dog’s favorite food in the world is carrots. If it was up to him he’d eat carrots and fried chicken every meal
Futurology,fby32zx,t1_fbx9vrs,1577206905.0,People need an alternative to vote for. No one deserves a vote you have to work for it. The only other real candidate was Hillary Clinton and she didn’t give people a reason to vote for her she just expected people to vote against trump
Futurology,fbxxfhk,t1_fbx8551,1577202997.0,"I’m in Alabama and I’m confident he could win an election here easily. His supporters either don’t know about the dumb shit he says or just don’t care. I don’t even really blame them for voting trump in 2016. Trump came in promising  infrastructure, healthcare, jobs, and tax cuts and that corrupt slimy politician Hillary Clinton promised no change. People are desperate and there was no alternative. He’s a liar but at least his lies were good"
