I think there should have been something done, so that the banks who lent out those subprime mortgages should have had to go insolvent from the all the money they owed the public. Then the recovery had and has less jobs than they try to portray to the public.

I don't think that punishing the banks would have necessarily led to better outcomes for the working class, but it should have been done regardless to nationally discourage that kind of reckless lending practices going forwards. I think Obama was incompetent when it comes to the recovery. He was born with a silver spoon up his ass. He has no idea what the common person deals with, and he likely never will."
dankmemes,fff9kie,t1_fff4tgd,1579879064.0,"The American Psychological Association aka the people who write the DSM on what is and isn't a mental illness disagree. They list gender dysphoria as a mental illness, but there are plenty of trans people who do not experience clinical levels of distress after transitioning. They *specifically* do not list being transgender as a mental illness if you go to their page on the topic.

Considering that prolonged distress that negatively affects one's ability to live their life is the main criterion for almost all mental illnesses, that stance makes perfect sense. I'm sure you don't actually care about the facts, though, considering you're trying to defend the use of a slur that implies that trans people are trying to trick straight men into sleeping with them. If you'd ever talked with any trans people you'd soon find that most are scared to death of facing violence in any sort of situation remotely like that because statistically the rates are so high, especially if they're a person of color. You're just looking for an excuse for your bigotry, though."
worldnews,ffelrp1,t1_ffegruh,1579853485.0,"You'd be amazed how many Chinese people side with their government always or ignore the atrocities they commit. The whole sub is brainwashed slaves, but sadly even a lot of Chinese people who study abroad and have seen other cultures still think their government committing mass ethnic cleansing is A-Okay. I've talked with a few of them. People say Americans only care about their own country, which is true, but imo a lot of Chinese are much worse when it comes to this sort of insular attitude."

A crossdresser can and likely will go home and take of their clothes and makeup and whatever else at the end of the day. A trans person doesn't really get to do that. I know there are some people who cross dress everyday, but they are few and far between and probably understand why that terminology can be dangerous. A lot of people are really ignorant and don't know the difference at all."
UpliftingNews,ffebl7a,t1_ffdhgzr,1579842243.0,"You honestly think that Obama was *trying* to mess things up with his recovery plan? He's a horrible human being who literally killed multiple American citizens abroad without due process, but even I don't think he was trying to create a jobless recovery. Without what economists have learned since The Great Depression and some sort of recovery initiative, the 2008 recession would have been **worse** than The Great Depression. Was it handled as well as it could have been? Hell no. I still don't think that failing was intentional, though."

UpliftingNews,ffea0vf,t1_ffdie28,1579840858.0,"All the studies I've seen show that what you say is untrue, and that an accepting/unaccepting family is one of the largest predictors of suicide and whole bunch of other adverse things like alcohol/drug dependency, violence, discrimination, and even HIV rates.

This is coming directly from someone who has excruciatingly bad dysphoria compared to most. If tomorrow the world collapsed and I suddenly lost access to my hormones, I would not even hesitate to kill myself because I simply cannot imagine any amount of physical pain ever comparing to it. That's just it, though, some people have fairly mild dysphoria. Others have cripplingly bad. Being treated as less than human by your own family is traumatic and damaging for your mental health no matter who you are or what problems you face, though."
coolguides,ffe8l0w,t1_ffdwr24,1579839659.0,"I gotcha. I guess I'm just not taking this post the same way as everyone else. To me even if being spiritual is listed as a green flag doesn't necessarily imply that not being spiritual is a red flag.

I don't even agree that being spiritual is a green flag personally, and I would describe myself as a spiritual atheist. It really is a terribly vague term as well as this thread shows."

coolguides,ffdrbh7,t1_fezs6eh,1579827021.0,"I have a philosophy/worldview that takes some elements from religions that have existed across various cultures and times that impacts how I live my life. I try to mesh these ideas in with my understanding of psychology, mathematics, and a whole slew of other fields. If the individual beliefs don't mesh with all others and especially the facts, then I throw them out. I've incrementally refined my beliefs over time in this way. I basically independently stumbled into correspondence theory of truth because I had to find some way of determining for myself what was true and what wasn't in the wake of my insane family's young earth creationist upbringing.

When I first started this process to make sense of the world I was learning all the time. Occasionally now when I find new beliefs it's as if I've found a lost puzzle piece that informs and makes sense of all the connected information. There's no superstition or woo at all, because all of my beliefs have to jive with science. I'd still refer to myself as spiritual because of my beliefs, though, and if I *had* to pick a label for my beliefs I'd call myself a Taoist. I could easily pick some other term if I wanted to, though, because the core of my ""spiritual"" beliefs have been in various religions and cultures as I said."

technology,ff9s97f,t1_ff9nucq,1579720095.0,"I agree with everything you just said. The problem is that both our government (republic) and economic institutions (capitalism) are exclusive rather than inclusive ones. I think some countries like those in Europe which are democratic ""socialist"" states can remain stable if still wildly immoral under capitalism, but we have no limits to the number of constituents our so-called representatives can have. We used to have one a long time ago. 

This inherently means that as the population goes up, the price of buying individual votes through lobbying aka legalized bribes only goes down. Because firms lobby for special rights and privileges that allow them to grow even larger, there is always a vicious cycle of corruption that makes any country like the US ever more corrupt as a function of time. We are not a stable nation under late stage capitalism,  nor can we be unless one or both of these institutions is fundamentally reconstructed."
technology,ff9ni58,t1_ff9m395,1579716697.0,">A truly free market with lack of all force & coercion cannot exist. 

Don't conflate capitalism and markets. IMO market socialism is the best chance our society has. Please look into it. Markets are far from perfect, but they're by far the best option we have right now. Capitalism is what ruins it by skewing the playing field through inheritance and private property. A market socialist system can be the best of both worlds, with  democratic workplaces, equal opportunities for everyone, *healthy* cooperation and competition, etc."

ABoringDystopia,ff8h8ap,t1_ff8g46k,1579678377.0,I literally watched the cycle speed up in front of my eyes when I frequented /r/me_irl for a few years. I left when it got to the point where people would shit all over other posters/commenters for a meme that was popular the day before. Who tf has time to check a meme subreddit every couple of hours just to see what's in at that particular moment? It just really highlighted how pointless the whole thing was for me.
ABoringDystopia,ff8gsds,t1_ff8a68j,1579677805.0,"I mean actual ""traditional"" families would be even larger and more unified. Like for most of human history families or tribes all slept communally IIRC. I know this sounds trite and boomer, but we really are simultaneously the most interconnected we have ever been as a species, and yet in many developed nations we see each other less than ever before.

I think there are serious problems we create for ourselves in terms of both physical and mental health by following along with the societal models we've created. They exist because of historical economic reasons, but up until now we as a species really haven't examined what we're exchanging by becoming so, so far removed from our ancestral environment.

Instead of picking berries many of us mindlessly play candy crush which evokes the same sort color and pattern recognition dopamine loop, but do these things really bring us the same fulfillment as getting to literally enjoy the fruits of our own labor at the end of a long day, baking those berries into a pie and sharing them with loved ones? Many of our jobs are so mindless and soulless. Yet automation, which should be the great liberator from these oppressive roles, is on track to enforce them even harder under our capitalist hell-system. Idk where I'm really going at this point, and I'm a bit tipsy. Anyway. We shouldn't try to go back to some idealized past, but nor should we be content in our present situation. We should, however, examine our past and find what traditions are worth keeping before we throw the baby out with the bathwater as industrialization marches on."

On some level you're absolutely right, though. If there were plenty of historical examples of it then anarchism/democracy wouldn't be considered the radical position that it is.
