I read another article this past weekend about the sexual abuse among the Amish.  I get so sick and tired of men In the name of God taking advantage of girls and boys for their own sexual pleasure.  It’s so disgusting .  However in all these religions it’s okay, because apparently it’s what God wants to happen to our children."
