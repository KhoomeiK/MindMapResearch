Tho the game is still watching cancer spread, kill it early but not too early as wallachia is my experience
Edit: imereti is a top notch spot for cutting off his expansion towards the east. Make him choose between you and big allies and mamluks, he’ll usually fight mamluks. So then call a war of your own and proceed from there
Edit2: but yes he also declared on me once even tho i managed to win it. Man fuck he hates you just as much as you hate him lol. So yea its a difficult game regardless"

Whoever put it up first determines the price, if the dead zone is large and you put it up for a low price a buyer would get some of his money back, vise versa with you making more money also works as the buyer will adjust as he’s either later to ask for that price (therefore getting less back than before) or asking to buy below the seller’s price therefore no transaction happened (at all even as like i said it was a deadzone, nobody else would be selling for cheaper as theres no sellers on the bottom side of the deadzone, only buyers.

You’re no relative that has helped you in your life and i’ld just like to say you don’t owe him much, i’m saying this because of how difficult dealing with this can be. but do know if your relativee are pulling you down the biggest life savior are your friends. He might come over as slightly delusional and counter-productive with working towards happiness, yet in his mind he’s trying to survive and live another day. It’s a struggle that simply requires a lot of time, not even necessarily involving just you as this is not a 1 man job. But you can help him.
Physical activities are A++ (i’m not talking workouts, just doing anything together in the same space/room, even gaming will take hia mind off of sadness and more inclined towards people caring. Also i’m unsure about your age but you might seperate cities one day, so is the way of life. I have since 1 friend whom i haven’t lost in my life. We’re both busy people and can’t meet up often, but it’s really important to keep in touch. Sometimes we can meet and we just drink beer from 1pm till night catching up, so is the way of life.

You quoted “public”
then lets clarify that between public business property where employee’s are certainly allowed to have reasonable expectations of privacy, same goes for a school, stores, entertainment parks whatever. But that’s not the same as on the street public.

Oh wel te vinden, you ofcourse searched rotterdam-breda which only had a result from issues from breda-den bosch. That’s where the suicides actually happened.
https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/trajecten/s-hertogenbosch-tilburg
97 issues in 700 days. Average waiting time: 1 hour and 52 minutes, aaaaaaaight thats amazing bro. Oh and yea busses no, ns doesn’t always put in busses asap. Worst of it all was that i would be leaving from my hometown delft, already seeing online on some newspaper someone had suicided yet ns was still hopefull about timings and took them 20 minutes of me standing on breda to actually confirm it would take 2 hours, they don’t cancel properly. Everything with ns is about reaching high % instead of high satisfaction in my experience.

Last to add, the data is just incorrect you can tell so yourself. An average waiting of 2 hours once a week is simply because someone suicides once a week. Yet the graph show material issues on top, that can’t be right i know for a fact as i’ve traveled there. They skew data"
