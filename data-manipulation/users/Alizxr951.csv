If everybody’s pleasures were taken away, most would kill themselves because if you ain’t happy what’s the point of living right. Smh"
depression,ff2154g,t3_eqzk3k,1579491009.0,"Only Lord knows why I was born and I gotta realize that the point of living isn’t Happiness and it never was. It’s to serve God and Live the way he wanted us to, which is love everybody, Be respectful, Never prideful and THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHEN YOU DONT, be strong and know that no matter what happens in this world Good or Evil, If God got us then We gonna be Alright"
AnxietyDepression,fep01rg,t3_epzw9z,1579309121.0,Hey I know this isn’t what you want to hear but read the Bible( specifically Pslams) and learn about Jesus Christ the true God. I know exactly how you feel. You feel so dissociative and wonder why the fuck you’re born and what the point was if it was pure suffering and pain that you never thought existed. Me believing in god didn’t get rid of my issues like magic but gave me a reason to believe that we were born for more than just pain and suffering. There’s so much historical evidence about Jesus Christ that it’s a little overwhelming. Think about it.
depression,fe4lsd9,t3_eno7v3,1578860622.0,"I feel you with that but honestly having faith in god makes me feel better because no matter what happens to you on earth, you still have the next life with Jesus Christ in heaven and he will never leave you . Obviously you’re problems won’t go away but you’re still given the assurance that this ain’t all there is to life. I feel like that’s why the book of job is an important book and something we can all relate to. I feel like that book was meant to help us more than job himself . As reassurance that no matter what happens you will be okay as long as you have faith in God ."
