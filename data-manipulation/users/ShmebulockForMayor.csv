CowsForBurgerKing,ffilvq5,t1_fd6x2s9,1579976999.0,"Could argue this is about people voting or campaigning against their own interests, LAMF is about the response to the consequences. Bit of a thin line though."

You need to learn the difference between socialism and social democracy. The first is the USSR; the second is all the countries with the highest standards of living. 

Third trimester abortions are not the issue. Those are only done if the mother's life is in imminent danger. I don't think any Dem intends to make those freely available. Besides, no woman will carry a fetus for 6 months and *then* go ""nvm""."

gaming,fex28n6,t1_feuocfb,1579423120.0,"My favorites are: 

**Thomas Was Alone** - platform puzzler with a good story and beautifully narrated 

**Dandara** - metroidvania with a unique movement and combat system 

**Rollercoaster Tycoon Classic** - excellent port with a ton of scenarios 

**Atomas** - addictive puzzler

**Desert Golfing** - the most zen game in the Play Store. 

**Bridge Constructor Portal** - a great bridge constructor game AND a good use of the Portal brand"

3d album came out and they began to lose me. It didn't have the oomph of their previous work. I stopped keeping up with their releases. 

When I finally saw them again at Graspop 2011, they didn't have half the energy they did before. Just feels like they lost their spark."

Archer. Gravity Falls. Hilda. We Bare Bears. Both Avatar shows. Voltron. Over the Garden Wall. And I haven't even gotten round to Regular Show, She-Ra, or Gumball yet. 

And I am not even starting on anime because that's a whole nother universe. Animation is a wonderful thing and anyone giving you shit for watching it as an adult can go suck a tailpipe."

I'm not too hopeful yet, not with the disastrous Junji Ito Collection anime on mind, but I'll reserve my skepticism and wait for the first reviews. Ito's style is REALLY difficult to directly translate to animation, so they need a lot of good tricks and adapt it more loosely than Collection tried to do."

reallifedoodles,fd219bs,t1_fd0dkgv,1578140088.0,"Read it, you mean! It's a manga by Junji Ito. There is a movie adaptation but reportedly it's not very good, plus a lot of the strength of the manga stems from Ito's very detailed line drawing, so I'd leave the adaptation by the wayside and get the manga. It's among my all-time favorites."

The teacher gave me 4/10 because she did not believe I had not copy-pasted everything. Apparently she did not understand what I had written and she had to check with her boyfriend whether it was correct. My parents had to intervene. Wound up getting it changed to an 8/10."
