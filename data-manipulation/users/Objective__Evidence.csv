R&D costs are not why drugs are so expensive in the US. They recoup the cost easily, raking in literal billions on some drugs. 

The costs are so high because the US government, who's favourite hobby is letting companies rape their citizens, allows pharmaceutical companies to set their own prices, while in other countries the government negotiates with them first.
