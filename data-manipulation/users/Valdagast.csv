Physics,ffj5u8z,t1_ffizhk3,1579991151.0,Your mind-reading skills must be off. I am very concerned about misguided diversity efforts. What the universities need is not so much diversity of color or gender (although there may be other reasons to push that) as diversity of ideology. And there's a definite lack of that.
Physics,ffhzkw0,t3_etpy1g,1579960419.0,Dangerous when ideology trumps truth.

cats,ffhz9mp,t3_etqvek,1579960104.0,"It depends on your budget, but a Feliway pheromone releaser will make the cat feel at home (it's basically feel-good smells for your cat). Otherwise, take it calm and let the cat come to you. It will be scared at first, but even a very scared cat can become a cuddle monster (like my cat Nisse, who hid under the sofa for the first two weeks and now cuddles up to me whenever I lie down)."

cats,fff1evj,t1_ffeyw86,1579873039.0,That's what I do. Take the head in one hand and the butt in the other. Pull and twist. (The only time my cat has hissed at me was when I did this - he was upset that I broke his toy).
