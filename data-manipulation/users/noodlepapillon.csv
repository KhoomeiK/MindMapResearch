TwoXChromosomes,ff5fnmb,t3_erl9cd,1579590797.0,Have you seen the Brooklyn 99 episode that displays the difference in how men and women are treated professionally? I saw it yesterday and it made me tear up. I totally recommend it. We all need to stick together and I hate how true your post is.

fatlogic,ff5fil9,t1_ff57cut,1579590629.0,"Pole is so good for fitness and confidence. Before I got sick I did it and it is right up there with swimming as perfect exercise. Basically every girl in the class looked like a suicide girl except me but after a couple of lessons I got comfortable and had so much fun. Totally give it a go. My studio does introductory sessions, hopefully a place near you does the same!"

melbourne,fd44uwo,t3_ejx26b,1578164468.0,I was woken at 5am in Ascot Vale to the sound of an alarm I've never heard before (I originally thought it was an odd car alarm) and a bunch of emergency service sirens. Anyone know what was/is going on?

CPTSDmemes,fcx68ni,t3_ej826d,1578052940.0,Mine got teary and I never went back. Lol. I didn't know how to respond to it.
melbourne,fc4waz8,t3_eg1rxq,1577431079.0,"People are so confused about this side of town. My friend who lived in my apartment block in Ascot Vale to West Footscray to sponge off her partner and won't shut up about how dangerous Ascot is and how she's amazed I haven't been stabbed yet. I love it here! It's so nice and the rent is decent enough. I don't think Footscray is any better or worse despite the rep it has either.

I went to Frankston for the first time last week and that was pretty funny but its also beautiful there! I got robbed more in St Kilda (two times, different rentals) than anywhere else I've ever lived (zero). ðŸ¤·"

But I don't mind, I've still got work, there are a lot of new salons around that probably wont last the year (that happens with every non-groomer owned salon around here) and word of mouth will start to spread. My heart goes out to you all who don't have a second income X"
