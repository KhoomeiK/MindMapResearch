csgomarketforum,fefqc71,t1_fefo8g3,1579062191.0,There's like 4-5 collections that have mil-spec skins that you can use for tradeups that have lower prices...

PublicFreakout,febukzq,t1_fe8poec,1578962891.0,"You do realize that guardian link shows that, per capita, Native Americans are the most likely to be killed by police right? And White People are killed the most often overall. So if anyone should be mad about police brutality, it's either White People and/or Native Americans. There's not a disproportionate amount of black people being killed."
Chipotle,fe8mc4t,t1_fe8kewy,1578927872.0,"People in other countries would kill for a chance to live under a roof with plumbing, a heater/ac and food in a fridge, your ego is just so big that you would rather be broke than to live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a close friend? That's messed up. You don't realize how good you have it in the USA, we are all practically 1%ers here."
PublicFreakout,fe8lvfg,t1_fe8lg4d,1578927675.0,Agree to disagree.
PublicFreakout,fe8lkdu,t1_fe8jk3b,1578927576.0,"Just curious, what are some examples of racist police brutality from the last decade? I'm currently researching this topic and I would love a few examples that prove your point?"

First of all, I would roommate with someone if I were you, $1350 for rent by yourself is outrageous. I pay $400/month in California by roommating with 2 friends."

Chipotle,fe6nlkb,t1_fe5v0c1,1578897166.0,"They said they work ""doubles every single day"" so if I'm doing my math right, that's 80 hours per week, right? That's a shit ton of money, way more than I get and I'm doing fabulous. Just got a 2018 Honda Civic :)"
Chipotle,fe6n8jo,t3_entzkx,1578896773.0,"If you can't ""make ends meet"" while working 60+ hours a week, I have to ask, what are you spending your money on? Because I work 40 hours a week and I still have like $1,000 left per month after all bills and groceries. Seems to me like you need to go back to the drawing board lol."
PublicFreakout,fe6n0ey,t1_fe6mi9c,1578896532.0,"Yes... this is not a one way street.

Other races can be extremely racist towards white people. Infact I would dare to say, in my own personal experience, the white people I know are less racist than the black people I know."
PublicFreakout,fe6mavy,t1_fe6lzzs,1578895750.0,"You're delusional... All lives do matter. Black people aren't the only race that's effected by racism and such. I'm white and I got bullied for the color of my skin on multiple occasions, sometimes physically."
wholesomememes,fe6dcph,t1_fe6c13o,1578887604.0,Explain? I'm really curious what I said that's not true
wholesomememes,fe5x8wv,t1_fe5wskt,1578876981.0,"You have the privilege of living in a city, you don't have to. Prices for housing decrease drastically the further out of the city you go. Get a 3 bedroom house in the outskirts and roommate with a couple of your buddies and you're looking at about $400 in rent each, or in other words 20% of your income (working full-time minimum wage). And that's in California, I'm sure it would be cheaper in pretty much any other state.

Edit: It looks like people don't like to hear the truth. If you are in your 30's and trying to ''settle down'' with a minimum wage job, you're doing it wrong. If you are in your 20's with a minimum wage job, the above approach is perfectly acceptable (unless you're a very anti-social person)."

FashionReps,fe56vwt,t1_fe0u4jn,1578866158.0,"It's an ongoing battle we are currently in. Black people use the word hundreds of times a day, including in the most popular songs all over the media, but as soon as a white kid says it everyone flips their shit. Even though white people created the word and now they are stealing it from us. Black privilege at it's finest."
FashionReps,fe55z7r,t1_fdxo47i,1578865948.0,"If you don't want edgy white kids to say it then let's make it illegal to be used in the media (including rap songs). That should take care of it.
