UnresolvedMysteries,fe95s7k,t1_fe54m5x,1578934557.0,I too believe that he himself gave his name. Otherwise I think the police would never have discovered him. They were at a dead end pretty much.
UnresolvedMysteries,fe5ul5x,t1_fe5udpb,1578875292.0,"Interesting, I didnt know about the absence of calls, texts or emails. This is case is really disturbing."
UnresolvedMysteries,fe587dm,t1_fe55mhv,1578866494.0,I agree that if there is a MannyIRL he must be a criminal mastermind and a very powerful guy. I was expecting the documentary and the police to at least try to identify this but they simply just ruled out that theory because of the Basic Instinct one. It was hard to believe that he beat himself like the photo that was shown.
UnresolvedMysteries,fe53bud,t1_fe49luf,1578865289.0,"How did they debunk the Manny theory? I don't remember that. After watching the documentary I still believed the theory. Okay, sure he's a narcisistic guy amd would do anything for attention but the facts pointing to the theory were strong."

selfimprovement,fdfpt9x,t3_ekxt9i,1578367309.0,"I understand your feelings and I think it's natural to remember the good times you had while with someone and feel like you are less happy now, therefore, unhappy now, and you need someone to have those ""good times"". However, that is not true. Take care of yourself and your mind, seeking to be auto-sufficient and happy by yourself. This way, you will be content with your life with or without someone. Lovers, friends, family members can come and go and you will still be fine. You will have no fear of letting people go if they are not good for you. This could be a wake up call for you right now.
Thats only my opinion on the little that I know you. Well, stay strong and enjoy life as much as you can!!!"

selfimprovement,fd6wzrx,t3_ek4p58,1578196775.0,Keep it up!! If you REALLY want to change your mind and perspective about things (and I believe you do) you WILL be able to change. My advice is to take some time everyday to clear your mind and set it the way you want it to be (meditation is a great tool).
