I'm now in an open marriage,  so permanent hall pass, and have taken advantage of Fetlife, Whisper, and occasionally Tindr, to make up for lost ho time.

askcarsales,fcf44s3,t1_fcbzyp5,1577626433.0,"A lot of this is on the customer though. 
I'm at a small dealership in a small town. 
We price new cars at invoice minus rebates and used cars fairly, based on market value. 

When my customers are up front with me as far as what they want (car/features, budget or finance terms) and their situation (credit issues and trade info), a car deal usually takes around an hour to an hour and a half from the time they walk in the door to the time they drive off in their new vehicle. 

When they want to play games like throwing in a trade at the last minute, not mentioning they owe 45k on their Chevy Malibu, driving 6 vehicles instead of going through a few questions to narrow down options, or saying money is not an option then wanting a new SUV with leather,  nav, and a sunroof for $300 a month and nothing down, it turns into a long torturous process for both of us."
askcarsales,fcf22ne,t1_fccapi3,1577625949.0,"This isn't on the dealer though,  it's on the bank.  They're only going to do 84 months on a new car and will want to see excellent credit and possibly a decent down payment.

We can't ""accept"" finance terms for you."
askcarsales,fcf1oly,t1_fcb4vot,1577625814.0,"I've lived in those areas - median household income (not individual) under $40k, unemployment that hit 15% a few years ago and has dropped more due to people running out of benefits than getting decent jobs,  20% of the county on Medicaid, 15% on Medicare, 1 in five living in poverty. 

I've worked at a buy here pay here and one of the little lots selling the shitty cars other dealers rejected to broke people for 24.9% interest,  and I've worked at a franchise dealer.

A lot of people can get a newer and more reliable car with a warranty for lower payments,  even if it costs more on the sticker, but they don't know that because they've been taught all the deserve is the 140,000 mile shitbox they're paying $260 for every 2 weeks and that will break down and maybe cost them their job or cause them to have to pawn some things or take or a payday loan to fix when it inevitably breaks down."

askcarsales,fceywhk,t1_fcavudu,1577624994.0,"The problem with this is we don't often know the exact car they're cross-shopping with.  We get told ""give me your best price because I've found the exact same car for $1000 less"".

Sometimes it's a very similar car (often at a dealership with $1200-2000 more in fees and add-ons they don't disclose). Sometimes they're comparing our one owner, clean carfax, 4x4 with the highest trim level and a bunch of option packages to a base model 4x2 or manual with 60k more miles, 3 owners,  and 2 accidents."

todayilearned,fceqr2n,t3_eh15i5,1577622898.0,"I live in a city in North Carolina with a lot of Mayan people. It can get confusing with EMS and things like that because so some of the older people only speak K'ich'e, Q'anjob'al, Awakateko, or Mam and there are almost no translators for those languages around here.  Many of them learn Spanish before English because so many people assume they speak it.

Many of them were bought here by Case Farms to work in a chicken processing plant and they are a very exploitative and downright cruel company that takes advantage of the language and cultural barrier because it makes it harder for them to get other jobs."

None of the other stuff is necessary & its really easy to end up spending a ton (I didn't get into D&D when I was much younger because my first exposure was a friend who had a huge collections of books and miniatures and I thought I needed all that and couldn't afford it).

I just DMed my first couple games this week,  and ended up spending a lot getting ready for it, but it turns out the main things I used were minis (any kind of figures would've worked) and a dry erase map & markers. If you were only going to buy or make one thing,  I'd go with a mat,  but I bet this time of year you have or could cheaply buy some wrapping paper with a square grid on the back, and that works fine."
