raisedbynarcissists,fff598w,t3_esypyz,1579876037.0,"What. The. Fuck. Zyprexa is a heavy-duty anti-psychotic. That shit will mess you up. I take it periodically when I get kinda weird and yeah, the weight gain is insane and that's the most tame side effect. 

Definitely find another doctor. Tell them everything. I have no idea what the long term side effects are for taking an anti-psychotic that you're not supposed to take but that's definitely worth looking into."

Pushing myself way too hard, ignoring symptoms, blaming myself for being lazy, dissolving into a sea of self loathing and watching as my life completely collapses around me because I can't accept the grim, sobering realities of living with PTSD... But yeah; weighing yourself must be pretty traumatizing too."

ChoosingBeggars,feae677,t3_eo7kas,1578947518.0,"I briefly worked at a poutine shack on a touristy waterfront in Canada. Had a dude order food for his family, hand me US bills, and then ask if we could do a military discount for him... We didn't offer a military discount, not even for Canadian military. He scoffed and paid anyway, but like, I'm pretty sure he was American, due to his accent and US money. Why the fuck would we offer a military discount to a foreign armed forces member?"

TIL_Uncensored,fc5pc2n,t1_fc5gk92,1577463115.0,Oh interesting!!! Does it go away eventually? I grew up in a household where my parents smoked indoors with the windows closed (gross) so I've pretty much always been exposed to cigarette smoke. I do hope it goes away eventually.
TIL_Uncensored,fc5fx7n,t3_eg9lin,1577456449.0,"I quit smoking because it got too expensive... This *kind of* makes sense to me, but I do have a much harder time dealing with my emotions and stress without nicotine. I'm not sure if I'm happier? I guess I'm saving money."
