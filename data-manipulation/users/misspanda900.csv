OCD,ffgll96,t3_et5lym,1579909062.0,"Same, sometimes I’ll read about someone else’s obsession and it’s something I don’t obsessed about but then I will obsess over whether I will develop the same obsession now I’ve read it."
OCD,ffgbh9t,t1_ffgb5g0,1579902577.0,"Yeah I do the over explaining part and repeating things to the point my family are like “ok we get it shut up”

Also I’m just starting to realise how much of the things I do are ocd, also realised I’ve had ocd for as long as I can remember. Getting therapy soon though so it’s all good (well it isn’t but at least I’m getting help haha)"
Anxiety,feic4dj,t1_feic2mj,1579135040.0,Nah it takes 3 minutes and teaches you how to clear your head.
Anxiety,feic0hj,t1_feibs6k,1579134968.0,"You should try meditation, you can get an app for it (calm) it’s been helpful for me to get to sleep before. It’s just guided breathing no weird stuff."
Anxiety,feibokl,t1_feibhjp,1579134747.0,"I know that feeling, and the fact you’re not sleeping adds to the anxiety right? 

What I do is try to count, but I’ll do 2 numbers at a time or count backwards so it takes a bit more concentration. Also try not to check the time as it will make you more anxious.

If you have anxiety over sleep as well it’s good to try and except that sometimes you just won’t sleep and that’s ok."
Anxiety,feibfpv,t3_epb54k,1579134581.0,"Take a deep breath, it’s going to be ok. This pain won’t last forever things do get better. Just take it one day at a time and if that’s too much take it one hour at a time or one minute at a time. You can get through this."
OCD,fe55kyv,t3_ensvb5,1578865835.0,Has to be an odd number for me because I’m weird hahaha
OCD,fdp46tm,t1_fdp3z9q,1578619592.0,"Agh that reminds of the time I was checking stuff in my room, I was stood in the middle turning around looking at the plugs one by one going “yep” as I saw they were off and after a while I couldn’t even say the word yep anymore it was like my brain gave up talking and didn’t know that word existed anymore. Made my anxiety worse. Did that for like 2 hours."
OCD,fdnuzar,t3_emd9wq,1578593379.0,My ocd is now playing up because I noticed I put two of “then”  haha
OCD,fddgh77,t1_fdd0t4r,1578311224.0,"Glad I could help. 

I’d say worrying about that stuff is more anxiety which I guess comes with ocd, it’s just the constant obsessing over the same thing which I find makes it ocd."
OCD,fd5d6vt,t3_ek1kmk,1578176452.0,"Of course not 

You would have to get hit pretty hard"
OCD,fd5cgjv,t1_fd50yx8,1578176243.0,"omg same I’ll get this thought like “imagine how awkward this would be, what if you do it” and it also it feels like I’m actually going to do it or have done it."
OCD,fcz5q88,t1_fcz5m2j,1578094206.0,OMG...now I think about it that’s true. The more I obsess the more ridiculous and stressing the whole thing becomes.
OCD,fcz42k8,t1_fcz3wvo,1578093245.0,Synesthesia tho
insaneparents,fclp0l6,t3_ehlz7e,1577752982.0,"Thought all parents did this...

Me:*starts to cry*

My parents: “oh don’t give me that shit you know you did wrong”"
socialanxiety,fckzsoe,t3_ehir4w,1577736714.0,"I basically got so fed up of myself and said “fuck it” and started doing things I was scared to do. 

Spoiler: they’re never as scary as you think."
socialanxiety,fcksfbl,t3_ehgisk,1577732185.0,I go into airplane mode before viewing messages sometimes so they can’t see I’ve seen it straight away. You know just in case I need time to come up with a reply and also because I worry it’s something bad.
socialanxiety,fcknawt,t1_fckn7ya,1577729030.0,"Same, I can spend weeks thinking about one thing I said wondering if it was ok and wishing I hadn’t even said it. The other person probably long forgot about it."
socialanxiety,fckifv0,t1_fckibsa,1577726036.0,"Yep it’s very annoying, recently I’ve tried to be like “fuck it you only live once” and just say what ever it is as long as I think it’s in reason.

Worse that can happen is the person gets annoyed and you apologise...I guess"
OCD,fchx3oq,t3_egqeeh,1577655154.0,Just recently started taking it don’t know if it’s a placebo but been feeling really weird. It acts as a stimulant for me. I still get intrusive thoughts but I don’t spiral into a mess obsessing about them. It’s like my brain is moving too quickly to care. Not sure if I actually like it...
AskReddit,fchnl09,t3_eh6fpq,1577652087.0,Your symptoms
OCD,fca4baq,t1_fca3t94,1577562866.0,"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/902151/OCD-cure-magnetic-therapy-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/amp

Here it is I wasn’t actually searching for “ocd cure” or anything it just happened to come up when searching for something related."
Anxiety,fc8n5j3,t3_egqh9g,1577538326.0,"Yep I do this with all sorts but thought it was my ocd. Also feel like I can’t tell anyone what I’m thinking because then it will become real. 

Also get mad at people for things my brain has probably made up then feel really bad about it. The whole things so confusing because at this point I’m struggling to see what’s real and what’s not. 

Can’t really offer advice but know you’re not alone."
OCD,fc6qrxs,t1_fc6myb1,1577487110.0,This too
Anxiety,fc6q0g5,t3_eghn2y,1577486573.0,"Do it, probably won’t be as bad as you think and the only way to overcome your fear is by doing what your scared of.

Honestly you will probably feel so good about it afterwards too."
Anxiety,fc6pwug,t3_eghq2k,1577486502.0,It does have a voice tho...just my voice
healthanxietyhumor,fc5ag12,t3_dabes7,1577451014.0,This is ocd
HealthAnxiety,fc5abyj,t3_eg9exc,1577450884.0,I’ve had a low level ringing In my ears all my life. Thought it was normal till I realised other people don’t. It is possible you are only just noticing it because the wax in your ear made it more noticeable but you’ve been blocking it out before that.
OCD,fc3xgx7,t1_fc1805h,1577401138.0,"Omg same tho, recently when ever I get an intrusive thought I’ve been touching my nose three times to make sure I’m “safe from it happening”"
OCD,fc3xcak,t3_efxrg2,1577401046.0,"Yep, thought I was just weird aha"
Anxiety,fc3jgzi,t1_fc335yf,1577391154.0,"I took another 400mg after 4 hours and honestly I haven’t been this calm in months. My head is just so quiet. I don’t know if it actually does anything or if it’s just a placebo or I’m having a good day but this is weird. Starting to actually freak out about how calm I am but I can’t because I’m calm. I have pretty severe anxiety too (with ocd)

Will say this though, this is the only day I’m taking them. Ibuprofen will end up fucking up your stomach and liver if you take it every day."
Anxiety,fc2hj4x,t3_efpztk,1577360566.0,"Ibuprofen has actually always had this effect on me some what but I thought I was imagining it.

I just put it down to probably always feeling a bit achy or head achy or whatever and since ibuprofen gets rid of that it made me overall feel better. Maybe there’s something more to it though. Seriously thought I was the only one tho.

Going to go take some now and see.

Edit: it’s been about an hour and I’m still over thinking but I’m also able to think more clearly and logically now and my thoughts aren’t bothering me to the point of tears like they normally do."
