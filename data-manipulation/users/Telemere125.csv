Survival,fefv0fm,t1_fefj75h,1579066080.0,"I agree a .22 is a good idea, and I have a few of them myself (along with a crazy number of bricks), but I wonder why people don’t recommend a high-power pellet rifle more often.  I bought one for less than like $100 or so that shoots almost as hard as a .22 within short to medium range; at least strong enough for small game hunting. It’s easy to maintain since there’s no gunpowder residue. The ammo is even smaller and lighter-weight than .22 rounds. It’s not illegal to own if you’re a felon. It’s much quieter than any firearm. I’m sure there’s more reasons I’m just too tired to think of them right now."

It might be horribly unpopular, but granddad had a lot of time to make memories, that newborn might have only had that day if all had taken a turn for the worst...

I was sitting by my grandfather the minute he passed away (he was fully aware and awake), and while I’m very happy I was able to be there to make him more comfortable and ease his passing, I can’t imagine trading that for any of my children’s milestones. Much less trading it for being able to be there to support my wife during a trauma. 

This goes way beyond simply being an AH, this sounds like something fundamentally wrong with your relationship. I would never dream of putting a co-worker before my wife in anything. Sorry, but they could literally all burn (I hope that analogy hits home hard enough) before I would hope to put my wife through some type of trauma alone; much less just to let that co-worker hopefully make it to the hospital before pawpaw passes away."
