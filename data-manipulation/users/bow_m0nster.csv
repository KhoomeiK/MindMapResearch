Equating Black people's natural hair or hairstyles with negative connotations such as dirty, unkept, or unprofessional is still a form of racism. Eurocentric beauty standards are still hammered into everyone and it's only recently in society that we have started celebrating the diversity and being inclusive and accommodating to different types of hair. And a lot of it is also either from ignorance or unawareness, not malice, of the needs or attributes of different types of hair too. Black men in the military are required to be clean shaven just like what was standard for everyone. But black men's hairs are more likely to cause ingrown hairs and bumps if shaven.
