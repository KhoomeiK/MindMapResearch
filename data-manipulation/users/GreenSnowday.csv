politics,ffv3er4,t3_eva5pe,1580254756.0,None of us are gonna feel bad about some famous wealthy reporter. Don’t believe what you read on reddit; most people like what trumps done and especially how he has called out the media and exposed the shit show  that is American politics. Most of the media is just an extension of the Democratic Party. Fox News is obviously the republicans counter part.

pics,ffpgnuz,t1_ffpdhko,1580094586.0,Yes there is a lot of things that led to the Nazi seizure of power and how they consolidated it by getting rid of anyone who might not go along with their plans. Even a lot of generals and service members of the whermacht were disgusted by the actions of the SS. At that point though Hitler has total control of the state and they couldn’t do much about it besides literally turning on their country and taking him out. Which is easier said than done.
