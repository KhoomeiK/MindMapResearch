In my head Kylo becomes a more capable villain by tapping into the light side - for instance removing some of the intensity and passion to tame his recklessness.

- why did the Scout Troopers have to wait at the checkpoint? Gideon should have explicit orders to notify him of Baby Yoda's capture so they can skeddadle out of there toot suite, saving time and manpower

- why give Team Mando until sundown? Even if he doesn't have Baby Yoda yet, Gideon should have eliminated the immediate threats to his goal, and 75% of them are pinned down in that cantina

- why was there a delay once the flametrooper got knocked down? As soon as shots were fired, the Imps should have been on bang-bang-bang mode and kept pressing

- why couldn't some Troopers have waited in the sewers? Unclear if they knew about it, but how did they eliminate the covert in the first place
