NewParents,fgep5ww,t3_exxhs8,1580705408.0,"First of all, I'm sorry to hear what you're going through.  It's hard to offer much in terms of advice or opinions since we know very little about this man or his typical behavior.  For all we know this is a rare occurrence. Also we only have one side of the story so let's not blow this out of proportion.  

He wants you to take more care of the baby and you want him to be more supportive.  It's two sides of the same coin.

I'm guessing he's tired and frustrated, as are you.  When things have calmed down let him know where you stand on taking showers and what compromises each of you can make to reduce friction in the future.  Let each other know what you need/would like and ask each other how this can be resolved while still respecting the other person's needs.

Sounds like the bigger issue is finding more balance and having a little more sympathy and patience for eachother.  Remember why you love eachother and let each other know when you're starting to feel overwhelmed so you both don't lash out once you've reached that point.

Sorry for your frustrations and difficulties, best of luck finding resolutions that make you both happy."
