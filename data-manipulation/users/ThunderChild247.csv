Scotland,fgp3ehi,t3_ezpnno,1580995776.0,"I’ve always hated that argument, “how does it protect the public now?” 

By finding out how this shit was allowed to happen and stopping it from happening again. Sure the person who did it might be dead, but what’s to say the person doing their job in five years time isn’t going to abuse the position of trust as well?

So easy to forget that investigating crime isn’t just about the punishment, it’s about prevention."

Romney has likely signed his own political suicide pact, but he’s done what he believes to be right. He now sits in that small group of people who I have very rarely agreed with, but who I respect. People like John McCain and Gordon Brown."
worldnews,fgn5lnu,t3_ezgq7q,1580938146.0,"Dear America, your senate has failed you by ignoring evidence offered to them then claiming there was not enough evidence to convict, while also claiming he was guilty but it’s not that bad, and also claiming that anything a president does in the interests of their own re-election is fine if they believe their election to be in the national interest. 

Your senate has effectively killed any possibility that a President can be held to account for breaking the law. 

You have a choice now. Is that the country you want to live in? If not, screw waiting for November, he’s just been given the go ahead to corrupt the election if he wants to. 

If you are angry about your constitution being shat upon from that great fake-tanned anus, you should out on the streets. It’s time for a return to the marches we saw after his election, and don’t stop. 

Your country is being corrupted. Your values are being torn up. How bad does it have to get before you realise the time to act may already be passed?"

I said I would agree to this only if they acknowledge that it would be like Eastenders (or Days of Our Lives for any US redditors) if that show was live, had its scripts produced hours before airing, and consisted of 90% stunts, a lot of which were ad libbed live on air."

If he is into you, you’ll know it because he’ll blush like crazy."
