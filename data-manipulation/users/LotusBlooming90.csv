askwomenadvice,ffget8l,t3_etfc9r,1579904637.0,"I frequently received comments at my job about my weight (also skinny.) One day during lunch in the break room an older, overweight woman said,” you should eat a hamburger!” I replied, “and you should eat some carrots.” They started leaving me alone after that. My comment was rude thus highlighting how rude she was being to me in the first place. These types of comments in either direction are totally inappropriate, especially in the work place. Don’t tolerate it."
AmItheAsshole,ffdzlge,t1_ffbwp31,1579832885.0,"She absolutely is worried the bridesmaid would look better. It’s not about the color at all, OP is lying. If it were why would OP have asked her just to cut it as a compromise? When OP said in a comment that she asked the other girl to cut her hair she shot herself in the foot and made it completely obvious that this is all about how beautiful the other girl’s hair is. Case closed."

They are plaques given to local establishments stating the locations form of support, with the plaques being used to identify a LGBTQ friendly place? I’m guessing. If so that’s terrific!"
Endo,ffcrg4j,t1_ffcez8p,1579805727.0,"Unfortunately I’ve been on the pill for years and it’s been zero help. A few people have mentioned waiting to till I’m ttc and then if I find I’m having problems getting pregnant revisits the laparoscopy, which makes sense to me. I’m still concerned that there’s no way to tell what stage it is without surgery, and it can spread to other areas of your body including your lungs and brain. Which I understand is rare, but I can’t shake the feeling that it’s one of those things that just needs to be further investigated."
astrology,ffblve6,t1_ff9dqvw,1579771745.0,"I would argue that a post like this does a lot to discredit the astrology community. If someone with a grasp of science sees this and thinks the astrology community believes this equals actual science, they may laugh their butts off."
TryingForABaby,ffbc7m8,t1_ffbaxc2,1579759305.0,"Oh I didn’t even think to look for an Endo sub, thank you. 

I’ve made it perfectly clear to each doctor that ttc is my top priority, in the very near future at least. I do find it strange that hormonal bc seems to be the go to method for treating the pain, but I’ve been consecutively on it for years and it hasn’t improved the pain at all. Hm."
TryingForABaby,ffbbwe4,t1_ffbazmm,1579758975.0,"I believe they will be doing that during the laparoscopy. Your pain sounds as bad as mine. It was so unexpected, up until all of this started happening I had never experienced any level of cramping with a period, let alone something like this. Thank you for sharing."
TryingForABaby,ffbbs3k,t1_ffbalq6,1579758848.0,"Thank you so, so much for your reply. The info you shared lines up with my understanding of the condition, so it was very validating to read. I may take you up on your offer to message soon. And I have to add, I had one doctor tell me endo was unlikely because in too young. What?!? My best friend was diagnosed at 22, and I’ve read endo affects up to 1 out of 10 women of child bearing age. So I thought that comment was ridiculous. Having been diagnosed so young yourself you can understand what I’m up against here. I’m wondering if it’s worth it to keep looking for an OB who is more versed in Endo. While all three opinions agree that this is most likely the cause of my symptoms, some of their opinions on the matter baffle me. But I didn’t want to be one of those patients, thinking they know best. But everything you said has helped me feel like I’m on the right track. Thank you again, truly."
TryingForABaby,ffb8cp7,t1_ffb82gs,1579754833.0,It also makes me wonder if that’s the standard response to Endo? Just managing the pain and not looking into it at all? Seems so strange.
TryingForABaby,ffb8bkc,t1_ffb82gs,1579754796.0,"May I ask what a MFI is? 

And yes they kept reminding me all surgical procedures carry risks. My fiancé and I discussed these risks and we still feel it’s important to go through with it. I don’t understand why we are having to push to have it done. In all honesty it has me wondering if I’m just being crazy/over worried about my fertility, hence my asking here. I’m sorry you had to go through that."
