college,fezan3y,t3_eqx8h9,1579455401.0,You can also try trade school.
Advice,fek2sk5,t3_epk12w,1579191396.0,"If you’re afraid of not being able to study or find a job. You could try going into the trades, there’s a vacuum and high demand for it. You would be set in an apartment in a few years. I’m afraid of growing up too, but I know as long as I can find a well paying job that is secure (which trades will help with, everyone needs a plumber or electrician at some point). Relax, life will work itself out."

Advice,fe5d5lf,t3_entwma,1578867919.0,"Ask them what hobbies they have and if they would be willing to give them up like you have too. And tell them to stop playing the comparison game with you. Ask them to focus on how AMAZING your achievements are, instead of comparison. Let them know how your medical problems shorten time frames to complete these tasks and putting more pressure makes you more likely to give you a heart attack at 26. 

Take a day to go out and enjoy your hobbies. Turn your phone off and relax. You’ve clearly earned it."
college,fe59bmh,t3_enq6ro,1578866777.0,"     The school had a huge core and the core classes were made to be extremely hard. However, these classes built up my work ethic and allowed me to make friends as we struggled through them. I got help from the kids who were gifted in them as well. 
     Overall, it was the people that made me want to stay. If I didn’t have as good of a support group and friends, I don’t know where I would be now.  I have a boyfriend, a girl group,  and I excel in debate (my chosen club/main social group) because I decided to stay. And I’m so happy that I did. Life is going amazing for me right now. 
     Wait out until sophomore year. If it doesn’t improve by then, I would say transfer."
Advice,fe54idh,t3_enrnte,1578865563.0,"If you’re too depressed or tired to do something physical, or a goal, you can play a computer game! When I’m bored I like playing poptropica, it’s a fun to have puzzles and quests to solve."

Sororities,fdsf5x6,t3_emxqgm,1578701332.0,"I make friends super easy. My major is chock full of sorority girls. My twin sister was in a sorority. And the reason why I haven’t been able to rush is because I developed cancer at 18 which made college hell for 2 years and dragged down my grades. Now, my cancer symptoms have subsided, I’m taking classes more in my major which is a relief. And I’ve been wanting to rush since I was a freshmen."
PastAndPresentPics,fdegtcx,t3_ekvdpo,1578338711.0,What skin products do you use?
AmItheAsshole,fcvdptm,t3_ej0k8d,1577999951.0,"YTA, cancer is horrible and never easy. The success rate doesn’t matter, it can always come back, it increases her risk of other cancers. You do not get to decide whether BEATING CANCER is inspirational or not. Those 6 months must have been terrifying for her. Apologize and tune it out if it annoys you so much, but don’t humiliate her for successfully beating a deadly disease. 
   From- someone who survived thyroid cancer and was told to shut up about it."
self,fcox4fm,t3_ei8c7d,1577843983.0,You could go out to a bar or night club. Drunk people are usually very outgoing and are easy to make friends with.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fbx5jsq,t3_eewmos,1577170275.0,It blows my mind that I could actually drive there. (I’m from Ohio) And this isn’t in a different country!
