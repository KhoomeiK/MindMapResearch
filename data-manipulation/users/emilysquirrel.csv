Going back to basics- obedience training. Establish boundaries while also giving him 1:1 attention. 
Sounds like heâ€™s needy and getting away with being pushy.  My friends doodle was misbehaving in this same situation lol. Heâ€™s better now that he knows the rules of the house."

bulletjournal,feptj2g,t3_epsvzy,1579330766.0,Loved your flip through :) nice how you included a monthly theme page. Think I need to add that too.
bulletjournal,feps1zj,t3_epot7w,1579329338.0,It's cute!
bulletjournal,feps0ol,t3_epuvwf,1579329304.0,I feel the same as you OP.  ðŸ˜ž I'm still procrastinating on what journal to get lol. And Ill miss January which makes me feel like my bujo is already imperfect (which I know shouldn't matter) ahhhh! Definitely need to make a list of pages first like the suggestions above. Good luck to us!
AsianBeauty,f9q7x4v,t1_f9p58ll,1575556724.0,Someone suggested a mix this with a drop of the ordinary squalene and I find it's much better that way. Spreads easier and maintains moisture more? Doesn't clog my pores!
