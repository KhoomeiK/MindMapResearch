My only problem with MIL is that my wife and I are having a baby in a few months and inevitably the baby will have to go to their house. My issue there is that MIL's house is dirty. I've gently tried to bring it up with my wife, but it's a touchy subject. MIL works and has some health issues so can't do everything herself. FIL doesn't do any cleaning, nor does SIL. MIL doesn't push them to help with chores. 

When I say dirty, I mean *dirty.* There's stacks of stuff in every corner like old VHS tapes, threadbare carpets that haven't seen a vacuum for years. You can barely get into SIL's room. The kitchen is greasy. I don't think the cooker has ever been cleaned. Half the rooms don't have wallpaper. Everything in the house has that fine sheen of tobacco tar smokers houses have and it has dust stuck to it. The bathroom is just, eugh. 

I don't want my child going anywhere near their house unless they deal with it. Especially no overnight stays. I can just tell that this is going to brew into a fight with my wife. Obviously it's not just MIL and FIL/SIL need to buck up too but MIL I think needs to be the one to prompt this change"

My only problem with MIL is that my wife and I are having a baby in a few months and inevitably the baby will have to go to their house. My issue there is that MIL's house is dirty. I've gently tried to bring it up with my wife, but it's a touchy subject. MIL works and has some health issues so can't do everything herself. FIL doesn't do any cleaning, nor does SIL. MIL doesn't push them to help with chores. 

When I say dirty, I mean *dirty.* There's stacks of stuff in every corner like old VHS tapes, threadbare carpets that haven't seen a vacuum for years. You can barely get into SIL's room. The kitchen is greasy. I don't think the cooker has ever been cleaned. Half the rooms don't have wallpaper. Everything in the house has that fine sheen of tobacco tar smokers houses have and it has dust stuck to it. The bathroom is just, eugh. 

I don't want my child going anywhere near their house unless they deal with it. Especially no overnight stays. I can just tell that this is going to brew into a fight with my wife. Obviously it's not just MIL and FIL/SIL need to buck up too but MIL I think needs to be the one to prompt this change"

I had an old guy that kept coming into my work with computers to fix because he was determined to give all his money to Nigerian scammers. His family had sent an email to all the computer shops in the area with a request to not fix any computers for him. He wasn't even that far gone, could still pass for just a normal old man. His family explained hundreds of times, but then he'd get another email and off he'd go trying to send them money. 

My wife's grandmother started out this way too. Money kept disappearing and they discovered that her grandmother had started off buying things they didn't need, then progressed to just throwing money in the bin. To her it was just bits of paper and they were cluttering up her purse. They eventually had to take away her bank cards etc as she got to the point that she withdrew money one day and then just threw it away on the street.
