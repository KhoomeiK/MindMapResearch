AskWomen,ffdy1ms,t3_eszqxl,1579831763.0,"To not call my mother again.
For 7 years now she has never called me back, after I made a hopeful very last attempt of getting through to her to fix our relationship. Left her a voice mail after she previously had hung up on me. Told her, I love her and I would like to fix our communcation with professional help. And that I back off until then because our fights wore me down.
In the years before it was always I who made amends after conflict.
To not give in and call her broke me back then. It still hurts"

AskReddit,ff62sd1,t3_errk9j,1579617690.0,In my teens my parents abused me emotionally to a point where I didn't think I had any right to live at all because of how hideous I am. That I am a constant burden to the people around me. In my late teens my father became psychotic and threatened and tried to kill me. The next mornings he didn't remember and accused me if lying. My mother chose to look away. No one believed me. I even went to our small town police. They didn't help me. My mother eventually send me away to a far away university and I couldn't sleep for years fearing someone might burst into my room at night. Even after finding friends here I never could develop any sense of self love and feel like an imposter and parasite regarding them.
