I was asleep in my mum's car when she had a car accident. I was drifting off, and then I wake up to a deafening bang, and smoke everywhere. I went into shock, and couldn't move for a minute, until the driver she'd hit told me he thought the car might explode or catch fire, and so I managed to get out.


2 s--ual assult warning

I was repeatedly s--ually assaulted (it's a bit more complicated but that's the closest term) by my best friend (at the time) in my early teens and didn't realise they were technically assults until later in life. That in itself was incredibly traumatic. One that stands out a lot was we were just doing normal kid stuff, then she pushed me on a mattress, said something incredibly personal that she knew about me, and said she wanted to sleep with me. She didn't get off until started yelling to a point our families could hear, then told me she was joking. (Something she said any time anything she did wasn't well received.) The same person also forced me to watch gore porn and told older men online I wanted to see them m#*turbate, and would force me to shower Infront of her. I feel sick and confused thinking about this part of my life, and it left me with a lot of trauma that I still haven't worked through.

When I was young, primary school aged, I was in bed. I looked at my doorway and saw three people standing there. They were all white shapes. I stared and couldn't move for what felt like hours until I passed out. I don't know if it was sleep paralysis or because if my poor mental health, and didn't know that sleep paralysis was a thing until years later. I don't believe in ghosts, but the thought still scares me.

I was holding a door shut so a family member couldn't get into a room without a lock on it. She was screaming that she was going to stab me and trying to get in for about an hour. The police were called, they eventually showed up, had a quick word, and then left us all together again.

A boy put a drill behind my head and turned it on. I couldn't move. I can't remember the next part, but then I remember he walked around the classroom with the drill laughing and I realised the actual drill wasn't in it, but I didn't know that when it was at my head. He did a lot of other stuff as well, but that's the main thing that sticks out."

I cannot understand why they'd do then all day. That's annoying just as a person, and as someone with an intense fear of loud sounds, I wouldn't cope through it. I also love fireworks though. I didn't watch them this year, but I usually do. I have to wear headphones or ear buds to cope though."

raisedbynarcissists,fcjfspy,t1_fcclmro,1577686010.0,"Nah, my family takes any of my food that they like to eat. He used to tell me to cook for him when I was much stricter on my diet. I'd tell him, ""no. Because of the sudden change in foods I can eat I will eat all of this."" And he'd get super pissed off and crack it with me. I don't need to cook anything for him in the first place though. He's older than me and he can eat anything, and is perfectly capable of cooking for himself.


And I don't have sweets nearly as often as I used to, but he still eyes them off when I do have them, and I hide them. Always have because I know they'll do this stuff.


 I had 2 blocks of chocolate and said ""you and our sister can eat this as long as you ASK beforehand"", and they then both ate it without asking. Lucky my older sibling was in charge that day though, so they had to buy me a new one and apologise, bit they still get grumpy over it.


I'd made up some little gift bags off some friends as a Christmas present, and he went and ate all the left over chocolates. I asked and he said he'd ""only had a couple"". There was about 6 left after I made them up, and there were none left when I needed them as spares in the morning. He argued about it, threw a bit of a fit, but thankfully bought new ones after I'd told our mother.


Just today one of my siblings was saying they were hungry. He picked up the bag of chips that I had Infront of me and offered it. Told him it was mine and he glared at me and put it back down.


They used to just take food after I cooked it. Usually I would keep some for my school lunch (they don't have jobs or school) and they'd just. Take the food. One time my brother took a huge bowl of my food, and I went upstairs later to find it sitting on a bench outside of the bathroom. He hadn't even eaten it. Asked him why he took it/ and left it, and he said he didn't like it so he just left it. They've learnt to ask now, luckily."

They do a lot more than this. My brother is physically violent, and has become more so over time. My father was physically violent in my childhood. My father is emotionally manipulative, and emotionally abusive. My dad thinks I don't deserve affection because my mental disabilities are ""less severe"" than my siblings who have the exact same disabilities (one doesn't have one of the second disabity though, and I have other issues in top of that). He snaps at a second if I say anything he doesn't like, and no matter what my opinion is, even if it's the same as his, he disagrees with me. He's convinced he's a genius and says so to everyone. He used to smack me for fun when I was little and laugh the whole time. Would try to ""jokingly"" suffocate me by holding my nose and hands so I couldn't fight back, and then would yell in my face if I tried to fight back. He denies all of it. Every conversation leads to a fight unless I just go along with whatever he says. There's more to it as well, but I can't be bothered trying to get into it.


It's not nearly as bad as some people go through, and I understand that, and I'm very lucky for that. This is just one of those little petpeeves that happens all the time. I understand it really doesn't fit under abuse, but it's one of my ndads little ways he tries to start arguments, because ""I'm to picky"" or because ""it's for the whole family- even if it's the only one you can eat""."

- my brother went to the same gym I did and insisted he was fine wearing clothes that were too small, didn't need deoderant or a towel, and liked showing off by lifiting weights that were too much for him, or by trying to be extra with the exercises. If you mentioned it he would yell at you and flip his shit. He doesn't think he can be wrong. He's a neck beard, and he might also be an incel. He stopped going very quickly, I'm not sure why though, but I'm glad he did.


He made everyone uncomfortable. The trainer was doing basic training for us both at the same time, and mostly only did demonstrations with me because he was uncomfortable to be around and would try to impress the trainer women who was just trying to do her job. I had trouble coming back for personal reasons, anxiety, and because he went to the same gym."
