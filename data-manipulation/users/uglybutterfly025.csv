Then I started **Kings of the Wyld** by Nicholas Eames and it is so funny! The writing is witty and the characters are funny. The action is high but I’ve been reading this book all week and I’m only 60% through it 

I was hoping to read all day today but I’ve got a good headache right now :/

MakeupRehab,ffkcksz,t3_etzhr3,1580020551.0,"Packed a butt ton of boxes today, most of the kitchen, decorations, game stuff, all my books, and other random odds and ends. Also had a church group come pick up the old sectional so now we don’t have a couch until at least next weekend.. probably longer. I’m feeling a lot of feelings right now. This little house we rent really did feel like home and while 50% of my time was spent at a job I didn’t much like the environment of, the 50% at home had been great. We’ve been in this city for 5 and 1/2 years. I came here as an 18 year old college freshman ready to be on her own. Between then and now I’ve been broken and remolded and I’ve made a small life with a boy I met on tinder. In all our five years we’ve lived lots of places but we’ve only ever been in this city as a couple. I’m excited and terrified of what comes next for us"
