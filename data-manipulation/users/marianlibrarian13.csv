I've also never understood how people can't tell the difference between butter vs margerine or whipped cream vs. cool whip. But plenty of people say there's no difference. 

To me, butter makes things yummy. Margerine ruins food. Whipped cream is really yummy on top of pie. Cool whip ruins an otherwise good pie. That's how I felt about Halo Top. My normal ice cream is really yummy and totally worth having. Halo Top absolutely ruined my yummy ice cream experience and I was just disappointed."
fatlogic,ffiy6yk,t1_ffihl83,1579985625.0,"No. But I agree with my mom there. I love ice cream and bought halo top thinking it’d be the ticket. And wasted so much food. I will always side with smaller portions of full fat ice cream.

JUSTNOMIL,ffikm1r,t1_ffgxpr4,1579976124.0,"Thanks. Mine likes to offer to babysit, but then when we actually ask, she’s too busy. Or could we go out of our way to bring the kid to her house instead so she doesn’t have to drive to our house during rush hour. 

Then she gets mad that we ask my in-laws to sit for us more. 

The kicker, she regularly talks about how her mom never helped out because she viewed babysitting  as inconvenient. 

This is the bottom line with my mom. She hates just about everything her parents did but she exhibits all the same behaviors. When you bring it up she then starts wailing about how dare you compare her to her awful parents. She’s nothing like them."

There were gym classes that could have been fun, but they only ran at the same time as music theory AP and I was way more interested in AP music theory than I was for gym. 

Now if there was decent gym reform to have teachers that aren’t absolute douchbags and actually teaches kids how to work out properly rather than telling them running is natural and they should be faster, and if colleges didn’t require so many base classes to get in, I’d be okay with it."
fatlogic,fffygu6,t3_etbmyx,1579894558.0,"My mom spends so much time reading about diets and not doing anything  about it. She hates the idea of CICO and is constantly trying to find research to prove it wrong. 

Currently read a book called How Not to Diet by Michael Gregor that apparently talks about how the types of food you eat affect your metabolism differently. 

Never mind that I have successfully lost weight from CICO. she refuses to believe it’s a thing but won’t try literally anything else either. And then complains that she can’t lose weight. 

Hell even today she was going on about how the best way to eat fruit is whole and how you don’t derive as many benefits if you make a smoothie. And I finally said, “fine, but I won’t eat it whole. I’ll drink a homemade smoothie however that has three different fruits, spinach, and various seeds in it which gets me more nutrients than your one whole apple does.”

Like she’s determined she has to do things perfectly or not at all. And also she wants to eat ice cream. Not a reasonable serving of ice cream but half a pint."
bujo,ffdfgvh,t3_et000w,1579819770.0,"My thoughts on Level 10. I found it more useful for prioritizing things than actually having a spread with goals to work for? 

Essentially my level 10 is 12 categories (Family and Friends is split into three categores, parenting, family, friends.) And I thought about what would help me feel like I've reached a good spot in those areas.

Parenting will be ongoing. I don't know that I'll ever achieve all the goals I have written down because as my kids grow, new goals will pop up. Maybe when they're both out in the real world.

Other things like spirituality and giving aren't really applicable right now because the things that would make me feel fulfilled there aren't things I can work on now due to schedules, budgets, and the like. 

Personal Development makes no sense to me because just working on all those other goals feels like I've increased my personal development. SO it feels like a redundant category. 

This is a lot of rambling to say I use it more to categorize and prioritize my goals rather than making goals to fit into the areas. It's really fluid rather than a static spread with the idea of it being done."

An hour later.

Mom - ""you know. All the moms here use the stroller when they walk their older kids to school.""
Me - ""That's cool.""
Mom - ""Your stroller was really hard to push. That's why I want to get you a new one.""
Me - ""Like I said earlier, that's not a decision I'm going to make until I find I want a new stroller.

 - Eat only what I planned and prepped with a sound mind the day before.
 - Drink three bottles of water
 - Meditate
 - Do a prenatal work out.

So far I've done a work out and a meditation. I'm on track for water, and I haven't strayed from my food plan yet. 

Possible derailments to prep for: Kid and her obsession with hot chocolate which is my fault complete, the giant bag of white chedder cheese popcorn at work that a coworker brought in. 

For Hot Chocolate, ask hubby if they can make that an afternoon snack when I'm gone at work. Or fold laundry while they're sharing it. 

For popcorn. Put a blue bin over it on the work table so I can't see it. My two coworkers are good about not snacking so they won't mind. Bring yummy date balls instead that are prepped and planned for. Limit reasons to walk into the back office."

We stepped back Mother's Day last year so I could celebrate with kid 1 and spouse... and go to work. I've brought up how she does similar things her parents did to her before and she gets really upset and honestly it's not worth it. 

The best thing I can do is set boundaries, stick to them, and then shut down the conversation when she says we have a horrible relationship because there are too many boundaries.

Got pregnant. I was still overweight at my doctor's appointment, so suggested weightgain is 15 to 25 pounds. At week 24, I've gained 15 pounds.

Also fun fact. It seems I need to be eating more meals of smaller quantity during the day otherwise I bloat, get heartburn, and my blood sugar crashes. I've been really trying to move over to healthier foods, but the holiday season and my already hormonal and hungry pregnant self sabotaged my wise mind.
