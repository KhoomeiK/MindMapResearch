If you're not wedged right, bubbles can be a nightmare.  If you're not centered, it's going to be really hard to get anything even looking or feeling.  If you get to halfway through have to trim 1/8"" off the ring of clay stuck at the bottom of the hump to get it centered properly, don't worry about it unless your instructor is grading you on centering at that point.  If it's still not centered and you're already making the cylinder, try to keep the walls the same thickness, clay will move to the top lip that you can trim to make it even.  Too much water is only bad if you're flinging slip across the room, too little water will start twisting the structure.  If you're lefty, tell the instructor, some wheels have switches to change direction. 

Also, bring moisturizer for your hands, and have hair ties, don't wear nice clothes or shoes when on the wheel, and expect your nails to get a bit beat up.  I wore a smock really low, with a slit up the middle to help keep my legs covered while straddling the wheel.

YouShouldKnow,fdtkiek,t3_emyez1,1578718075.0,"With so many animals being picked up and either held for other medical treatment or transferred to other areas, it seems like the perfect time to test or treat all the rescued animals.  Could the antibiotic for chlamydia be helpful in treating burn infections at the same time?  The antibiotics might not be the best for the intestinal microflora, and there may not be the funding for full treatment of all the animals, but maybe now we can gather samples for gene banks, or test a chlamydia vaccine (which is currently undergoing human trials) with the young who haven't caught it from their mothers yet.  
Wherever animals are being returned to afterward, if isolated by stretches of burnt land, it could host a population of disease free, non-zoo koala.  This might give us a little more time to better figure out how to cure the remainder of the population, especially after numbers have dropped dramatically in the fires.   It wouldn't be the best, but look how far we're progressing with selective breeding for cheetahs to increase the gene pool... some koalas would be better than none.

Any scientists out there able to speak to the feasibility of this?  I realize it just might not be possible with current drain on funding."

Eating mostly softer processed foods results in poor alignment, but less wear, but possibly more cavities due to gaps and crowding.
