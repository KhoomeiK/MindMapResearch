WatchPeopleDieInside,ffabs4d,t1_ffabju3,1579731825.0,Oh yeah. I didn’t notice that. Ice mix will cut you right open. It may have been a bus. Looks like they saw it coming.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffab02r,t1_ffaaao8,1579731369.0,"Mix of snow and slush outside. Curb at street, along sidewalk has puddling.  Car or truck goes blazing down the road produces massive splash. 

Living in snow areas for awhile, you start to get complacent and not look out for it.  Years ago it used to be a big thing when all the muscle cars were out on the roads."

blanket over him on the couch right now. 

There could be reasons why people keep their dogs mostly outside i guess.  I dont ever want to know any people that do. Fuck em."

But then there is also a champions league tournament going on now. Looks like all the Europe teams?  Are those participants from the results of last years leagues? 

Thats a huge hinderance on the US being fully engulfed into the premier league. No tourny for the final winner. Everything is like that here."

You gotta interrogate them on that . 

It did cut down on the ability to trade,rent, buy.
