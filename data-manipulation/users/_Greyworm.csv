Bunka is sort of a Santoku with a tip like a Gyuto.. I wouldn't say it is better than either, but ocne you get practiced at using the back end for veg and the tip for meats, seems to be working very well.

If everyone thought like that, no one would even consider solving their own problems, let alone attempt to physically speak with another human.

Bunka is sort of a Santoku with a tip like a Gyuto.. I wouldn't say it is better than either, but ocne you get practiced at using the back end for veg and the tip for meats, seems to be working very well.
