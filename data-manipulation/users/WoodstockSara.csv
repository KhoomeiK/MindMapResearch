reactivedogs,ffgteor,t3_et960s,1579914589.0,"There are a lot of good posts and suggestions here. To add, there is a pretty amazing dog food called ""Just Food For Dogs"" at Petco. It's human-grade dog food, frozen and you defrost in the fridge. They also have a shelf version that does not require freezing but not as many flavor/ protein options for that. There are a few easy-digestion formulas that have been game changers for owners with picky eaters and dogs with digestion issues. They also offer prescription dog food for certain health issues, and even custom-make food for owners, if you contact them on their website.  [https://www.justfoodfordogs.com/custom-prescriptive](https://www.justfoodfordogs.com/custom-prescriptive)

They also have recipes to make your own dog food by buying ingredients at the grocery store and adding their supplement, the recipe makes 11 lbs of dog food at a time (you can half that or whatever) and the supplement lasts several months and cost $19. The food quality is so high that you give less cups per day than regular canned or kibble food. Many owners have been elated that their dog started eating again."

Try boiled chicken, cooked hamburger bits, salami, lunch meat, hotdog bits, cheese...find something that is way more rewarding than the poop. Street dogs are tough, I get it, they will gulp down whatever they have if someone else tries to take it. But treat to the nose can induces a voluntary behavior where they decide that what you have is better than what's in their mouth and they will drop it to get your treat. Other enticing treat suggestions: raw food freeze dried bowl toppers, freeze dried fish skin/scale treats, freeze dried liver, peanut butter, etc. The freeze dried stuff is like concentrated dog crack.

I am a certified dog trainer and the expense, trauma, time, and danger involved with some dogs is negated by the fact that there are so many other dogs waiting to be adopted, hoping to find their forever homes, who sit in shelters while owners desperately work with a case that may be unmanageable or require life-long, diligent oversight while not providing any enjoyment to the owner. ""Playing god"" sucks, but the fact is, millions of wonderful, adoptable dogs are put down every year. Will you feel guilty about it for a very long time? Of course. Do you want your life controlled by an animal that causes you stress and anxiety instead of having a mutually beneficial relationship? Heck no."

reactivedogs,ffekvln,t3_esqpd5,1579852319.0,"Hi I am a positive, certified dog trainer and a few things stood out to me with your post that could help explain the behavior.

1. Your dog knows you are leaving and was possibly feeling high anxiety. They quickly learn about suitcases and packing up. There are a lot of cute videos of dogs and cats sitting in open suitcases ""protesting"" their humans leaving.
2. When the sitter crouched down to offer a greeting, the dog reacted. It can be helpful if people ignore the dog on initial contact, and let the dog calmly sniff and approach them at their own pace. Sometimes, being a calm and aloof human is exactly what a dog needs in order to gain confidence and feel safe.
3. We don't really know how great of an experience your dog is having at the sitter's place. I'm not saying anything bad is happening, but as someone who also dog sits on occasion, my charges have super fun and positive adventures with me. I also know how to read their body language and emotional levels and only do things that they voluntarily want to (example: dog won't walk far from the house and is looking back with worry a lot). I don't push them to keep going, I play with them out on the sidewalk, offer treats and be super fun and engaging, and if they still don't want to wander around with me, we go back inside and play indoors instead.
4. Dogs instinctually do not make eye contact with each other. Eye contact = threat / fight. Teach your dog to LOOK at your eyes and make it part of your daily training.
   1. How to train this: Treat to his nose as you say his name, bring treat up right between your eyes as you say ""LOOK"", then say ""YES!"" when he looks you in the eye, and give a treat.
   2. After you have 90% success with this, start using your finger without a treat in your hand. Say his name, finger to his face, finger up between your eyes, say ""LOOK"". When he looks, say ""YES!"" and give treat from your other hand.
   3. After you have 90% success with this, say his name, say ""LOOK"", (no hand gesture), if he looks at you, say ""YES!"" and give treat from a hidden hand.
5. Use the ""LOOK"" command whenever you want his attention, (say his name, then ""LOOK"", then whatever other command you want, such as SIT).
6. Goal is that when you say his name, he looks you in the eye, ready to perform something for awesome rewards. We are not teaching him to make eye contact with other dogs, but teaching him that eye contact with humans is rewarding. Humans make eye contact all the time, so our dogs need to learn that this behavior is not a threat."
reactivedogs,ffejjm6,t3_esyifc,1579850630.0,"When I adopted my senior dog with arthritis and early hip dysplasia, the prescribing vet had her on 3 trazadone per day plus a liquid anti-inflammatory. Went to a new vet closer to my house and was told to stop the trazadone completely as it made the vet's dog very loopy and messed with her ability to physically function, as if she was drunk. Have you considered trying CBD or a hemp seed oil product to reduce anxiety? CBD oil can be given daily dripped onto food. Do some research and maybe try it out.

reactivedogs,ff2i58k,t3_er4vko,1579507164.0,"Not square one! It's called ""going back to kindergarden."" Every time you introduce anything new to the training environment, expect the behavior to be altered and not predictable. Goal is to get the obedience commands proofed at home, then slowly take them out in the world, adding only one new challenge at a time. Add only one of the ""3 Ds"" to the dog's world (Duration, OR Distraction, OR Distance).

Example: dog does fine in public while being ignored by other humans. Suddenly, the human engages with you. Your dog freaks out on the human. Was there less Distance? Was there more Distraction? All at once? Too much! Offer treats to fellow humans and explain that you are working on your dog's behavior. Engage your neighbors in your goal of training your dog to trust humans and learn confidence while strangers become treat dispensers. Go up to other people and touch them. Show your dog that this person is safe, touch the person, crouch down with them, ask your dog to approach voluntarily after you approach. Toss treats as you do this."

reactivedogs,fema9wj,t1_fekuoml,1579245718.0,"This is a great post. I am a positive dog trainer and associating new people to your dog as treat delivery systems works wonders. No eye contact, no hovering over the head, let your dog approach if he wants to. Throwing treats on the ground and letting him decide how close to get can work very quickly, like he might come up within 5-10 minutes, but the human should continue to ignore and just chill out and let him sniff and explore without any engagement other than dropping a hand down to see if he will come up and sniff it. Basically, they become a piece of furniture. With the barking, a gentle ""eh-eh"" and ignoring works. As soon as he stops barking, reward with tossed treats and ""good...settle"" in a calm voice. Also, when you guys are hanging out without anyone else around and your dog is just chilling out, practice giving doggy massages and saying ""settle"". Teach him a word that associates calm behavior with wonderful rewards and calm attention. They are bred to work off our cues and need our direction and guidance. Teach him that you are the benevolent leader and have everything under control. Guide him to use behaviors you want to see, instead of just stopping behaviors you don't want. (give him something else to do that is favorable to the current, unwanted behavior.) They are reward-driven and are bred to follow our command, guide them and they will be much more settled and happy with positive leadership. Think of it as a soldier ready and waiting for a job.

Barking is 1: I am bored and want attention, something to do, or exercise. 2: I don't like this scary thing and want it to go away. 3: alerting you to stranger danger.

For barking #1: more engagement, be fun, do trick training, exercise. For barking #2: soothing, low level exposure to scary stuff while offering high-value treats, using the threshold distance, asking him to sit through scary stuff to become desensitized, while letting him nibble on good stuff to change the association. Barking #3: Good boy, thank you! now come to me and stop the barking. Dogs that trust us read our body language and smell our excitement levels, so remaining calm and in charge helps a lot. Example: dog and owner have a negative encounter on a walk and the 2 dogs snap at each other. If the owners yell and scream and have a fit, the dogs learn it's the worst thing ever. If the owners remain calm and act like nothing happened, the dogs learn it's all fine."

Go sit by the staff and touch them, asking your dog to approach while telling her this person is a ""friend.""

Every one that your dog meets, give them treats, say ""friend"", go over to the person, touch them, ask your dog to approach them with treats. Encourage her to come up willingly while being heavily rewarded. Don't ask her to engage with any human who is standing and leaning over her, ask everyone to crouch, extend a treat hand, not make eye contact, use a soft, high pitched soft voice, throw treats on the ground, kissy noises, and become a non-threatening treat dispenser. 

Let your dog approach willingly while receiving high value treat rewards from everyone she encounters. By asking dogs to voluntarily approach, you train them to learn confidence and think for themselves. Go at her pace. Example: stick a treat to her nose and let her lick/munch on it as you walk her towards the vet door or daycare door. Keep up the treat delivery and lure her to where you want her to go. Get her to focus on your hand and the treats. This is called
