They're not the Aerogarden ones (pricey, harder to get in the UK)  but just cheap aquarium 'silent' pumps with a splitter. You can really run all 4 from one pump if you get enough line & splitters as they're far shallower than the aquariums' they're designed for. 

Most noticeable changes for me are better root development  & less issues with things like stem rot (on the tomatoes)."

Futurology,ff9xnt6,t1_ff9wxej,1579723742.0,"If you puncture a gas tank then it leaks out and can catch fire. A hydrogen tank is at up to  700 bar (10,000 psi)...puncture that in a crash and you have a massive quantity of readily ignitable gas in the vicinity of crunching metal. The tolerances and specs to make a safe hydrogen storage tank are tricky - how they'd age over the long term is even harder.

The major push for hydrogen (outside off-grid electrolysis and storage)  is really down to one thing  - currently it comes from natural gas...petrochemical companies see it as a way to counter electric (battery) cars."

dotnet,ff39jlb,t3_er85rs,1579536871.0,Yeah there really can't be up to date printed books like the 'old days'. Things just move too quickly these days. The years of '3 year release cadence' are long gone. You \*can\* find 3.0 (not +) books...i.e. ones for specific versions but they will rapidly become out of date as new versions appear.  I suspect once .NET 5 releases it will calm down a little...once 'big corps' are all in then Microsoft will have to reduce their 'breaking change' approach to .NET Core.

VPNTorrents,fen12i2,t1_fen0ncm,1579274594.0,"1.  1st reason i don't really understand.
If you're trying to download a 200mb torrent which is 'new' then most seeders will likely have the *first few Mb* for the first short while. So you get the first bit quicker as there's more seeds of those first few Mb...but again unlikely as it would be for particular torrents only.

2. Yes try it with a large file...

3. It *is* throttling...that's the behaviour you're describing.

Scotland,femzrqn,t3_epval2,1579273735.0,"So  the position of both major UK parties is that Scotland's future is a matter for English MPs. The simple fact is that only 11 of the 59 Scottish MPs are Unionist. Therefore to have a democratic say in our own future it would \*need\* to be a majority of English MPs (representing English voters) voting to allow us that.

The issue isn't \*who said what when\* but that Scotland's citizens do not have the democratic right to decide the future of our own country  - not even the right to decide if we \*get to ask the question\*.

There is now \*NO\* mechanism that either Labour OR the Tories have set out which would give us that right...they get to decide just how much democracy Scotland is \*given\* by England.   
It would seem only reasonable that a Parliament elected by us to represent us (and which uses a FAR more representative voting system than Westminster) would get to make the final decision on the future of our country."
VPNTorrents,femxycw,t3_epzv1c,1579272488.0,"A few reasons why this could happen..first is many torrents have varying availability throughout the file (so people download first episodes at higher priority).  However this would vary widely by torrent. 

The second is that your ISP could allow 'burst' type download speed (it's how they cheat on speed tests for example)  and caps it after a short time...then it's really irrelevant if you'r  using a VPN they'd just cap the rate (test this by downloading a very large file \*not\* using the VPN - Wikipedia is a good test as it's large and has torrents AND direct downloads  [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data\_dump\_torrents#English\_Wikipedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dump_torrents#English_Wikipedia) ) 

Third is that your VPN is throttling after a set time (try a different VPN / Endpoint on the same one).

Fourth is that your Router is overheating (seems unlikely but ISP supplied routers are generally AWFUL...)."
