yoga,ffiry6c,t3_ett08b,1579981208.0,"I am also a cancer patient (stable right now though) I do yoga with Adriene videos and yin yoga at my gym. 

Yin yoga is mostly long stretches and I think it helps with pain and mobility. Not much strengthening though.

Yoga with Adriene videos have helped me improve my core strength so I can do things like bend over, or get out of my car, etc. I had no core strength and terrible back pain after having 9 surgeries. I like her ""find what feels good"" philosophy, that you shouldn't pressure yourself to do anything that feels uncomfortable to you."
