DestinyTheGame,ffonppa,t1_ffonb44,1580079647.0,No?
DestinyTheGame,ffnt0i2,t1_ffnsivc,1580070401.0,I k ow the encounters. I've done it plenty. I just don't know how to runes work to get specific things. So all the runes sit there in my chalice.
HistoryMemes,ffngs9t,t1_ffn9kwy,1580065766.0,True. That may be it. I have no clue either.
DestinyTheGame,ffngqry,t1_ffncxpo,1580065748.0,For me it's YouTube mostly. 2hen I'm respawning I watch and when I'm fighting I'm just listening. Makes the game less stressful
DestinyTheGame,ffngn4u,t1_ffndjh4,1580065704.0,Saladbar. This community and the character names. Lol. I don't k ow how menagerie works so idk about beloved.
DestinyTheGame,ffngiz3,t1_ffndv5r,1580065651.0,Buuuut devil's ruin. I need it XD. having three types of weapons is better than a sniper that I miss half the time with.
aww,ffngfch,t1_ffne9ov,1580065605.0,Ohhh. I don't understand how animals work XD. she looks like she's eating the other one.
DestinyTheGame,ffng6gv,t1_ffnfgan,1580065493.0,I don't have headphones with quality surround sound and even then it doesn't work in destiny. Only game the headphones work in is Warframe so even if it was helpful it doesn't work. I rely heavily on radar and map knowlege because of this and because of the handicap it makes comp more entertaining XD. on top of that my game sound doesn't work correctly with or without headphones.
aww,ffne78q,t3_euasl7,1580064782.0,Is nibbles the one eating the other one? XD.
aww,ffne2pq,t3_euatcv,1580064726.0,That's a happy man right there.he looks a little dead inside but still looks happy lol
DestinyTheGame,ffndwc4,t3_euaty3,1580064650.0,I am. And give some of the older exotics that have catalists a facelift. Stability on the hard light is nice but not very useful.
HistoryMemes,ffn96br,t1_ffn8zgr,1580063304.0,Why are we only making ww2 memes on the weekends tho. What the heck did I miss? XD.
destiny2,ffn93g5,t1_ffn8vn4,1580063270.0,True. The abilities should be the part that makes the melee different not the range or speed.
DestinyTheGame,ffn8woz,t1_ffn8o9b,1580063197.0,I need a kinetic one cuz I'm kinda addicted to devil's ruin.
destiny2,ffn8qbb,t1_ffn819p,1580063131.0,"They do, but warlocks need a melee speed increase because while they have good range. I can lunch faster than a warlock melee as a Titan."
HistoryMemes,ffn7v6n,t1_ffn7m2m,1580062938.0,Well then. I don't post on this subreddit so it does t bother me any but it's a really wierd rule.
destiny2,ffn7pgo,t3_euac1g,1580062883.0,Are you a warlock?
HistoryMemes,ffn7ehm,t3_euacn7,1580062778.0,Why are they banned on weekends tho. I am super confused.
DestinyTheGame,ffn6ch2,t1_ffn5neb,1580062503.0,For all content I just listen to music. Pvo is much easier with other background noise than gunshots and explosions. Albeit it does mean I run into way more supers on accident but it also means I can focus more on what I see than being distracted by something on the other side of the map.
destiny2,ffn5lc7,t1_ffn4zre,1580062247.0,Ah. Well that's awesome mate!! Could I see a picture once it's painted? XD.
DestinyTheGame,ffn5bzp,t1_ffn4msi,1580062172.0,I'd rather watch YouTube or listen to music while I'm playing. Makes it way easier to focus plus I don't have to hear any of the NPCs talk.
DestinyTheGame,ffn4shh,t1_ffn406m,1580062085.0,You can't put mods on it so that makes things even easier.
DestinyTheGame,ffn4gyu,t3_eua1lv,1580061986.0,I don't even play the game with sound lol
DestinyTheGame,ffn441f,t3_eua3b4,1580061858.0,Don't know if you can tag either of them or if they will even see it/care.maybe tweet it at dmg?
destiny2,ffn3rb3,t3_eua4g8,1580061730.0,Is this last word or ace? I'm guessing last word because there's no spade on the chamber. XD.
DestinyTheGame,ffn3k6x,t1_ffn2ypt,1580061662.0,I have izinagis for pve so that's not a worry. I just need a good pvp sniper so that I can get revoker XD.
aww,ffn385x,t1_ffn24eo,1580061560.0,Ah.hes a cute looking turtle!!
DestinyTheGame,ffn32a0,t1_ffn1bm1,1580061499.0,I'll give it a try then. I want the revoker but it's hard to snipe enough to unlock it XD. I'll see how the alone as a god handles and maybe use it to unlock revoker.
aww,ffn1jws,t3_eu9psp,1580061046.0,Did he scare you and you jumped? Looks like you shook the camera.
DestinyTheGame,ffn15f1,t1_ffn0u6n,1580060930.0,I dont have the energy to grind ib this week especially for a roll that isn't hipfiregrip. I'll look into that next time iron banner rolls around tho.
Warframe,ffmzlct,t1_ffmzhau,1580060501.0,Darn. Well thx for the input.
destiny2,ffmzitq,t3_eu9u6v,1580060479.0,I love the broadsword. And yes this is badly needed.
Warframe,ffmuxiu,t3_eu9hce,1580059230.0,"For an iron skin build. All strength (transient fortitude, blind rage, things like that) none of the rest other than efficiency matter much for a fully iron skin build but you will be hurting yourself in range and duration in the other abilities.  for roar and stomp you want strength, range and duration. And for charge you want range and strength. So, transient fortitude, the three umbral mods, blind rage, fleeting expertise, stuff like that. Hope that helps!!!"
DestinyTheGame,fficpy2,t3_etsww7,1579970751.0,Ib doesn't feel like a struggle cept through the quest. I'm a 974 Titan with both 97 resil and 81 recovery and I have no issues with the gamemode. None of saladins stuff is very useful or intresting so I don't usually go anywhere near him other than to pick up the pinnacle bounties. The idea of rolls like the lectern would be a really great idea but we would def need more weapons in the loot pool to make it feel rewarding.
Minecraft,ffibf5j,t3_etsunm,1579969863.0,It's a feature in windows 10 and phone addition. Not sure about java
DestinyFashion,ffhz1ya,t1_ffhgk69,1579959884.0,Lol. Mines an exo and doesn't look all that bad tbh. XD.
destiny2,ffhyxpc,t1_ffhakt2,1579959762.0,Thx lol. Titan is one worn out boii too
aww,ffh6az2,t1_ffh69hf,1579924305.0,Ohhh thought you were gunna eat it lol.
Warframe,ffh686a,t1_ffh63k4,1579924244.0,Why? It's not fun to sit through the update and reinstall. Unless you don't want to play anymore then i can't help ya there.
Minecraft,ffh62as,t3_etlfze,1579924114.0,Nether is a little messed up but that house is dope.
Warframe,ffh5uhs,t3_etli7e,1579923941.0,Alot of people are also using the private launcher because steam likes to randomly uninstall the game. At least for me it did.
Minecraft,ffh5r2t,t1_ffh5nx3,1579923866.0,That's really dope. Although that back wall looking a bit empty XD.
destiny2,ffh5odt,t3_etlka6,1579923806.0,Haven't heard about it.
destiny2,ffh5mf7,t3_etlkoy,1579923762.0,That's pretty dope especially since it's an autorifle.
aww,ffh5kug,t3_etllgr,1579923729.0,Why is it on the floor tho?
Minecraft,ffh5jdc,t3_etlljj,1579923698.0,Is that on the cultivate server or a private map?
Warframe,ffh58m5,t1_ffh30wb,1579923465.0,"Tiberon prime is pretty cool because it has three fire modes semi, burst, and full auto. If I could get to the me I need to use it I def would"
destiny2,ffh2ucp,t1_ffh2bqi,1579921606.0,It might be straight undoable sadly
destiny2,ffh2q7d,t3_etl4ke,1579921520.0,If they have high resilliance yes damage mitigation will be way higher. My 980 Titan with 80 resil and recov was able to tank multiple enemies at once and get one or two kills before I went down.
DestinyTheGame,ffh26zp,t1_ffh1qlr,1579921112.0,I did the valor resets last season and was still able to claim it this season
destiny2,ffh22rq,t3_etl2y0,1579921024.0,You have to light a bunch in a pattern. If you did that and it was bugged well then I have no clue.
Warframe,ffgx0r2,t1_ffgwshd,1579917223.0,Hmmm. Could use the tiberon prime depending on your mastery rank. Another good one would be the lmg Baro brings every so often.
Warframe,ffgwnm9,t1_ffgwk13,1579916956.0,I've heard it's pretty good. Although for gauss if you want a machine gun use his rifle.
DestinyTheGame,ffgvrww,t1_ffgvftp,1579916314.0,Very true. Would be cool if it was gjallrhorn as I never got to play d1 but it's highly unlikely.
Warframe,ffgvnqo,t1_ffgvi28,1579916226.0,When I got it it was pretty meh. But with 60% crit and 80% status without a riven or primed mods it's able to shred lvl 150 enemies with ease. Let's just say... It's now my primary weapon for all content in the game minus eidelons.
DestinyTheGame,ffgvjuf,t1_ffgvh3d,1579916147.0,The gjallrhorn has a way different sight than the one on light.gg
DestinyTheGame,ffgvdhl,t1_ffguk9a,1579916019.0,It's a rocket launcher scope no one knows what it's for.
Warframe,ffgv8jg,t3_etk3ar,1579915918.0,Both the dread and dayku are pretty great bows if you like bows. Opticor Vandal if you want a slasher sniper minus the scope. Those are the few I know of the top of my head.
pcmasterrace,ffgm3oj,t1_ffglihk,1579909409.0,"I would say go to the front pages only and check the comments I downloaded over 50 or so games and none of them were fake some of them were 
.rar files so I couldn't open them though. I also didn't touch any of the horror games so they could have some fakes."
pcmasterrace,ffgldtx,t3_etilvc,1579908922.0,I've used itch for a few really awesome games. They were simple puzzle games but they were really beautiful. Itch had a malware checker for that reason so as long as it doesn't look off-putting its worth looking into.
Minecraft,ffg9vih,t1_ffg8u8r,1579901589.0,Yeah. A build battle pvp mode would be fun too. Start in creative and after 5 mins turns to survival
Minecraft,ffg8pbx,t1_ffg84kg,1579900867.0,Too bad bedwars doesn't have a build time. That would make it alot more fun.
Minecraft,ffg82n8,t3_etgp1t,1579900481.0,Did they lose?
pchelp,fffwvdm,t1_fffwknx,1579893564.0,That's a little strange. When I check task manager both memory and disk dont go higher than 80% without anything other than Warframe running. I haven't looked with both running so it may be soemthing like that.
pchelp,fffwdm1,t1_fffw8so,1579893253.0,Hmmm. Ok. I'll try that when I get a chance to open my computer again. Could it be soemthing to do with Warframe being in a solo launcher isntead of steam tho?
pchelp,fffw4jt,t1_fffw0ja,1579893096.0,Should I not be using the optimal settings set by the GeForce app then?
Warframe,fffk5d5,t3_etd7u6,1579885707.0,Why's it even on your kid lol.
Warframe,fffhrb5,t1_fffhkow,1579884234.0,I'll look into stilletto and jakara!
Minecraft,fffh2gf,t1_fffgk9y,1579883804.0,No worries :) beautiful house by the way!
Warframe,ffffycw,t1_ffffqpm,1579883115.0,Yes the furis is good but I don't think it can do very much to a lvl 95 heavy gunner.
Minecraft,ffffr1h,t1_ffffldn,1579882988.0,I mean the house looks beautiful too. It's wierd seeing it sideways tho XD.
DestinyFashion,fffelbl,t3_etcbqk,1579882263.0,Other than the fancy cape and some of the exotics you aren't wrong and I'm not even a hunter lol. The season ornament set actually looks dope although it's far outclassed by the titan set because holy crap the Titan set makes my buff boi like chivalrous. XD. I'm not particually find of hunters because of the way they play. But fashonframe is the endgame tenno. Hunters need a really cool looking set or two so that all three of my classes can be decked out in fancy stuff.
Minecraft,fffe8kb,t3_etcch4,1579882037.0,"Nice, how long have you been playing the game sideways? That must be extremely complicated."
DestinyTheGame,fffb528,t1_fffahs2,1579880073.0,True! People can post their opinions here doesn't mean they need them seen
Warframe,fffa4w5,t1_fff7o85,1579879433.0,It's such a fun gun to use and hits so dang hard as well.
DestinyTheGame,fff4s15,t1_fff1o49,1579875686.0,There aren't any text prompts other than the ones on the quest tab and you need to rest those to know what you are doing. But there's nothing showing how armor works or how to switch perks or any of that.
Warframe,fff0xhe,t1_fff0e4g,1579872634.0,Yeah I was doing void defence and was clearing the back of the map of 5 or more enemies in a row
Warframe,ffey6a4,t1_ffexaob,1579870115.0,Does the op Vandal have damage falloff tho? The thing has so much range and accuracy the simulacrum ist big enough to test.
Warframe,ffevg22,t1_ffecij7,1579867244.0,I just hit mr 13 a few weeks ago and am max rank with steel meridian so I'll take a look at both of the last two. Mara detron prob not gunna happen for a while.
Warframe,ffev8j0,t1_ffeb09n,1579866996.0,"*nodds* ""shoot better you stupid gun"""
Warframe,ffev7aa,t1_ffee9z8,1579866956.0,"Yes, very. Most op gun in the game"
DestinyTheGame,ffev6ll,t1_ffegzp5,1579866933.0,That's good to hear! Starting out was miserable lol.
Warframe,ffeuxpg,t1_ffekxn5,1579866636.0,Currently I have an opticor Vandal as my primary so having a sniper secondary would be kind of nice
Warframe,ffeuuly,t1_fferlu7,1579866533.0,Rip the catchmoon.
Warframe,ffeutgu,t1_ffeca1q,1579866495.0,"Viral,/slash opticor Vandal 60% crit 71% status 

Viral sepfhan/plauge bowkin/vargeet Jai 11 120% crit and 34% status. 

And valkyr prime."
Warframe,ffe7jyn,t1_ffe7igm,1579838823.0,Oh. Right. I was thinking of banshee primes signature sidearm.
Warframe,ffe6q3p,t1_ffe6hej,1579838168.0,There's so many cors that I have no clue. Heck half the time my weapons get lisst in the sea of sentient cores I have.
Warframe,ffe6cvc,t1_ffe69dt,1579837885.0,Is that the corpus arm cannon or the tentacle gun from fortuna?
Warframe,ffe3gkm,t1_ffe38ji,1579835705.0,Sweet!!
Warframe,ffe2vpj,t1_ffe2u4x,1579835275.0,Wait pyranna prime is gud?
DestinyTheGame,ffdzgs9,t1_ffdy95c,1579832789.0,True. This game is almost and i mean almost as bad as Warframe when it comes to helping new people. Even with all the videos it's still rough unless you have someone there to guide you. I still have flashbacks of attempting to get through that one lost sector in the edz with the big open bridge and the cabal dude with the rockets at the end. For me psions were the toughest enemy.
DestinyTheGame,ffdy0fr,t1_ffdxmq2,1579831741.0,Sure wish I had tutorials or the campaign when I started with new light. I was at light lvl 940 by the time I even made it to the campaigns was running around like a potato not knowing what the heck I was doing
destiny2,ffdxrt4,t3_et3flq,1579831569.0,"I'm a Titan main and I can tell you, pvp it'll be bottom tree due to the double shields. For pve middle tree code of commander. The detonators combined with the shield can clear out an entire wave of the adds in the hallowed lair final boss fight and give you double super energy."
destiny2,ffdxlmq,t3_et3h0n,1579831445.0,Iron engrams. Sounds really cool.
Minecraft,ffdxgks,t3_et3hnt,1579831345.0,Lightning strikes most likey.
destiny2,ffcg88l,t1_ffcg3fe,1579798789.0,I don't snipe either. In fact I dont have a pvp sniper or shotgun. Randy's is just as good and can flinch a sniper pretty well.
destiny2,ffcfnsg,t1_ffcfhq1,1579798443.0,Eh. There have been a few times I've been the only good one on my team which makes it really hard to win. Last Man standing against 3 enemies isn't the easiest fight. But I've never really noticed that Doing bad hurts anyone else you lose almost nothing in terms of points.
DestinyTheGame,ffcfi7v,t1_ffcf0ky,1579798347.0,I play pve alot more than I do pvp mainly because there's no rewards in pvp. So whenever I'm bored of pve I'll jump into a game and good off with whatever gun I'm feeling that day.
destiny2,ffcfee9,t1_ffcf1zc,1579798282.0,Is comp just stressful? I don't see how comp is harder than standard pvp other than people fight harder. Half the time I'll throw on a random assortment of guns and rek through comp.
destiny2,ffcf6r2,t3_esvmtm,1579798151.0,"*reloads izinagis with malacious intent* ""come and get me thrall."
