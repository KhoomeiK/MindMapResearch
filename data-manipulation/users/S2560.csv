notmycat,fdyrsln,t3_enbwlt,1578782894.0,"I live in a housing estate in a small town (<5000 people). I have seen several cats both in the estate and the town itself. One even visits me most days and another hangs out at a supermarket a lot of the time. They're both friendly, as are a couple of other cats I encounter less often.

Conversely, there are cats that aren't friendly, including most of the cats that come into my garden. It's pretty much luck that determines if a cat turns out to be friendly or not, as IME it's a roughly even split.

One cat I have to distinctly remember was this scruffy ginger-and-white that I saw the odd time in 2018. That June we noticed him in the garden after dinner, and since he had seen better days we thought he'd just take off when the door opened. Instead he just marched straight in to the house and briefly explored the kitchen (we didn't let him stay too long as he was a complete tom and didn't want him to spray in the house). He hasn't been seen since.

And for those of you enquiring, we believe it to be unrelated to the ginger-and-white I posted a couple months ago."
