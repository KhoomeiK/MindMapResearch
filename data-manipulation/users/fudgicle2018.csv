WhoAreThesePodcasts,ffhh7ie,t1_ffelzp4,1579935101.0,"That I am, and proud of it.  Glad you are too!  Yes the wedding video was supposed to be this big fucking deal, along with a dozen other things he's hyped forever that never came to be.  He also said about twenty times that Suzanner would join him for this show.  I guess that could be because he no longer has a proper studio to accommodate a guest, but I think it's because she hates his guts.  Their ""great relationship"" is another lie he keeps telling, proven by the fact that even though one of their kids is still a pre-teen, she didn't tell John that she's remarrying this summer.  

I can't decide if he's a pathological liar or is just incredibly dumb, or both.  Royce gave him some brief credibility but again, NOTHING they've ever talked about has actually ever happened.  One exception was the John/Jackie/Billy West interview, but that thing was way bigger than John's dumb ass, and that too was supposed to be a multi episode event, that died after one.  

Even after John got national coverage with the Trump prank call - they bragged about all this shit that was supposed to come from that and absolutely NOTHING panned out.  I think Royce was doing the old WWF trick where you constantly posture and hype a bunch of stuff, to make yourself seem more legit.  ""John, if you want people to do business with you, you can't admit that you have nothing going on.  So we'll just make up a bunch of projects, talk about them on the podcast, and that'll make us sound like players.""  All the while hoping no one will notice that nothing they ever talk about actually ends up happening.  So even if Royce eventually rejoins the show, it means nothing because nobody wants a useless alcoholic with mushmouth and b.o.  

Don't look for John to ever be camera ready.  This is a guy who admits to going to his son's birthday party not having bathed in days, and that a repair person stormed out of his house because the place was too filthy.  But, his show is still the best hate listen in town and other than the Opie madness, is the greatest reality show EVER."
