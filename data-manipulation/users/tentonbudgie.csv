EDIT:

***Among other findings, his research indicated that the identification number tattooed on Mr Hirt’s arm was actually that of another prisoner.***  

A Pennsylvania man who claimed for years to have escaped from Auschwitz, met track and field star Jesse Owens and Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, (got busted by a history teacher and had his pants pulled down in public so he) confessed on Friday that he had fabricated the entire story.

“I am writing today to apologize publicly for harm caused to anyone because of my inserting myself into the descriptions of life in Auschwitz,” Joseph Hirt, 86, wrote in a letter [sent to his local paper](http://lancasteronline.com/insider/lancaster-county-man-admits-he-made-up-auschwitz-story/article_81a47e7a-3951-11e6-9e8d-37be8d75db92.html), LNP, this week. “I was not a prisoner there. I did not intend to lessen or overshadow the events which truly happened there by falsely claiming to have been personally involved.”

“I was wrong. I ask forgiveness,” he added. “I determined at that moment to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of the truth about wartime life (and death) at Auschwitz.”

For years, Hirt gave public speeches about his experiences in the second world war, including his Jewish family’s flight from Poland to Belgrade. But he also told people that he was arrested by the Nazis, sent to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, and met Mengele, the SS physician who tortured prisoners of the concentration camp. Hirt claimed to have escaped under an electric fence at the camp.

He added an extraordinary prologue and epilogue to the story, saying that he saw Adolf Hitler turn his back on Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and that he met Eleanor Roosevelt and Owens after his arrival in the United States."

My personal take on this situation is that it's typically the parents who are the cause of the problems, it's rarely the kid.  When it's the kid though it's pretty obvious.

I don't let teenagers fall through the cracks when their parents lose their insurance.  Some of those kids are good people who need a little help now and then.  I tell them that I won't let their bill be the reason I d/c their services.  Show up, do what you're supposed to do, and I'll see you for $5 for a half hour for six appointments a year.  If you're having a bad month and need an hour clear it with the front desk and book it, that's fine.

If the parents are a disaster then I'm more likely to offer help to the kids, but I limit it to my willingness to give.

In practice those kids don't tend to show up for their $5 appointments so the therapeutic nature of this offering is more to acknowledge the value of the kid and to tell them that it's worth paying attention to how they think and feel.  YMMV"

One mechanism which might be involved in long-term (and possibly permanent) effects of benzodiazepines is an alteration in the activity of benzodiazepine receptors in brain GABA neurones. These receptors down-regulate (become fewer) as tolerance to benzodiazepines develop with chronic use. Such down-regulation is a homeostatic response of the body to the constant presence of the drugs. Since benzodiazepines themselves enhance the actions of GABA, extra benzodiazepine receptors are no longer needed, so many are, in effect, discarded. These down-regulated receptors are absorbed into neurones where, over time, they undergo various changes including alterations in gene expression. When these receptors are slowly reinstated after drug withdrawal, they may return in a slightly altered form. They may not be quite so efficient as before in increasing the actions of GABA, the natural ‘calming’ neurotransmitter. **As a result, the brain may be generally less sensitive to GABA and the individual is left with heightened central nervous system excitability and increased sensitivity to stress.** Molecular biologists point out that changes in gene expression can be very slow, or even unable, to reverse…

**It is not unusual to experience recurrence of apparent benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms years after a successful withdrawal and a return to normal health \[“setbacks”\].** This particular pattern of symptoms is unique to the individual, depending on his physical and psychological makeup, and no doubt on the innate density of his/her benzodiazepine receptors and the balance of his [**endozepines**](http://benzo.org.uk/ashsupp11.htm). **The experience of benzodiazepine withdrawal is deeply etched into the mind and memory of those who have been through it, and it is actually physically present in the strength and connections of their neural synapses, as all memories are. These recurrent symptoms are all signs of GABA underactivity with its accompanying increased output of excitatory neurotransmitters, resulting in a hyperactive, hypersensitive central nervous system. The mechanism is exactly the same as that of benzodiazepine withdrawal, which is why the symptoms are the same.**

In nearly every case of apparent recurrence, the precipitating cause for the return of symptoms turns out, on close inspection, to be an increase in environmental stress. The trigger may be a new stress or worry which may be unrecognised so that the return of symptoms seems to occur out of the blue. Contributing factors can be an infection, surgery, dental problems, work problems, fatigue, bereavement, family problems, loss of sleep, **adverse reaction to a drug,** change of environment—almost anything."

1998 Ford Explorer 4x4 4.0, took it from 120K to 180K, paid $3K, put another $3K into it mostly in the trans and drove it full time for eight years, got a check for $3K when it got totalled out so I bought a

2002 Ford Explorer 4x4, got it at 170K, just over 195K right now.  $1950.  Found out about the brass grommet upgrade in the 55 trans, planning on doing that in the next month or two.  Also need to rebuild the trans, flush the cooling system and replace the radiator, fuel pump, water pump, thermostat, master cylinder, window switch unit on driver's side, and have all the body seals replaced, ignition, air filters, cabin air filter, alignment, compression springs to bring it down 3"", and basically get it ready for another 7 years of service.  It fits our needs very well, just need that trans fixed.  Then a nice detail and it should be good to go.  Well, probably brake pads too.

2008 Crown Vic PI, bought it at 84K for $2900, trans rebuild with a shift kit, drove it to 160K, then my iridium spark plugs blew and ruined the engine.  I wasn't going to pay another $2K to keep driving the cop car, so dumped it and picked up a

It needed a serious alignment and some of the previous owner's work on it was pretty amateurish so getting that cleaned up.  Struts and shocks, the suspension otherwise is fine.  Head gasket is leaking and something else is leaking oil that's dripping off the trans, but the trans is fine.  I'm going to try and replace the radiator myself, it doesn't look like it's out of my range.  The stereo sounded great stock so didn't have to do much with that, the tint on the back window is a little foggy but I don't care.  The aftermarket front bumper blocks the fog lights which is a PITA so I'll have to figure that out later.  It's been painted red at least three different times before somebody put a stupid carbon fiber hood on it that blocks about 2.5 inches off the bottom of the windshield so that's going to go in a couple months.  I'll probably go with a $500 black carbon fiber hood so I don't have to repaint anything, the contrast between the hood and the red should overshadow the fact that the rest of the car doesn't match perfectly.  I'll probably be $7K into it and the fog lights will still be blocked, but that's good enough for me.

A 25 pound bag of rice is about 60 cups of dry rice, so 750 calories per cup of pretty much just carbs.  For a family of 4, that's 15 days worth of carbs for energy.  You need a 25 pound bag of rice for every two weeks you want to keep from losing a lot of weight.  One can of sardines should be enough to handle some aspects of mental health, and a big ol whack of vitamins and mineral supplements turn any food into enough to get by.

If somebody had 20 sacks of rice at 25 pounds each, that would be almost a year's worth of carb calories, energy to keep going.  Then you'd need 4 cans of sardines per day, so that's call it 1600 cans of fish to have one per day for a family of 4.  I'm a fan of green food powders to get at least some of the nutrition from fresh vegetables.  I like the encapsulated ones.  $0.15 per cap, ten per day, so $1.50 per day times 4 is $6 per day for encapsulated dry veggies, so $2000 for a year's supply.

Almond butter is the new peanut butter, so at 2750 calories per pound we get four 700 calorie portions per pound, or enough fat and protein to meet some basic nutritional needs.  One pound of almond butter is about $6 fresh and $10 sealed, so a pound a day for four people is 375 pounds or $3,750 to put up.

One can of fish per person per day is $1.41, so $2100 to put up one can of fish per day for four people for a year.  The fish has 18 grams of protein and 11 grams of fat, plus 1800mg of EPA and DHA.  Such important nutrients if you want to be able to think six months in.  $400 to put up a year's worth of rice.

$8,250 for dry food without water or fuel to heat anything.  Water costs are going to vary widely.  All I need to do for water is wait for the rain to fall, then collect and filter.

Easily another $1000 for various supplements and bags of coffee and shit like that.  I would love to have half a cow butchered and boned out in a chest freezer as well.  I would want to have enough power to keep a freezer cold during that time, it doesn't take much.  I bet a car battery setup could work out.

So, that's survival for a year.  I think it starts at about $15,000 to be halfway OK for the duration.  That doesn't include toilet paper or fresh underwear or soap.  A diet as restricted as the one outlined above is likely to cause any number of nutritional deficiencies, so that's going to have its own problems.  

If you've got money left over then bricks of .22LR, cases of chocolate bars, cases of vodka, extra socks and underwear, all good stuff.

For the guards, I think offering them substantial real estate holdings in exchange for their service would be a great way to go.  Plant a shitload of fruit trees for them, help them develop their water supply if a well would do it, etc.  Give them a reason to stay and cooperate."

It helps to watch the intro and know that Cliff's parents are there for the show.  In many ways the guys in Metallica are so clueless about some really basic shit.

It's possible that unprocessed wheat bread is OK for you, that the problem isn't really with the grain, it's the way the grain is handled.  This is a further minority opinion in the US but isn't quite so controversial outside the US.  See if you can find a bag of wheat grown by an organic pesticide free farm.  If you can find some, grind it into flour yourself at home and make a loaf of bread.  This is really only going to give you a comparison if you wash out of grains and beans for a couple months first.  You might be clear sooner, but some people's metabolism doesn't clear the effects for a while, so give it a chance.  Then try a loaf of clean wheat bread and see how you react.  For some people, the government-mandated iron in wheat flour is too inflammatory and it causes autoimmune issues.  Other people have a problem with the gluten, and that's why they get the same symptoms.  The difference is, of course, the treatment needed to resolve the symptoms.  One way is to avoid the chemicals, the other is to avoid the gluten.  Sometimes doing both at the same time is easier than trying to figure it out, but that's up to the individual.
