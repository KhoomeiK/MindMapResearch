todayilearned,femw2b9,t1_femva49,1579271119.0,Yeah man crazy right - the Japanese army association even hired their own manga artists to capture war in art and make different propaganda for them. Super interesting stuff.
todayilearned,femug6j,t1_femsyl7,1579269908.0,Essentially it led to an increased macho mentality and helped increased proto nationalism especially in young boys - those of age that would be reading. Look up  Suiho Tagawa’s *Norakuro.* This was basically a manga about a little black dog that wanted to take up arms and fight the West - aimed at children. There's other examples but that ones pretty famously nationalistic.
todayilearned,femsfii,t1_femr624,1579268292.0,I wrote a thesis about the impact of manga and anime on Japanese soldiers in WWII and I was told the same thing hahaha.

EDC,femlqlc,t3_epw77y,1579261704.0,Man when I was a kid I had the choice of a see through red micro or a blue advance. I took the new screen advance - but I still wonder if it was the right choice. Still play leaf green and ruby on it.

AskReddit,fdmwbt0,t1_fdm7vg0,1578568811.0,This room is a staple in every arab home - if it was ever used you were in big trouble. Thankfully my parents always thought it was stupid but I would always get in trouble at friends houses.
zombies,fdmve1o,t3_em2cjn,1578567601.0,"I would often dream of like a 28 days later / she who had all the gifts type of zombie - incredibly fast, strong, and evil. I always get these when I am overly stressed - and 9 times out of 10 I wake up right before I would have died. But they are always super exhilarating.

The one thing that sticks in my mind is that the zombies always have this incredibly evil smile and they always talk in broken english. Smile is similar to [link](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/man-portrait-evil-look-isolated-260nw-239879692.jpg)."
analog,fdmtzi9,t1_fdkvx90,1578565697.0,Yeah super nice - Gave me hope as I've just been sitting on the lomochrome not sure what to do with it. I might try it for portraits and see if I can get this look.
