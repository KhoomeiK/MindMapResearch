The guy says “play a samba.” I play what I assume might be what a samba sounds like. “Play xxxxxx.” I play some bullshit. “Play xxxxxx.” I play some more bullshit. No fucking clue what I’m doing.

I’ve gotten really accustomed to having my single 5 in its location. I’m *thinking* about taking the upgrade option for a Move to replace it. But, 30% seems minimal given the cost of these things. I hate that I’m being forced into this purchase.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,feohw8u,t3_eq76a4,1579300437.0,"First use a digital distribution service to get a song on Spotify (I used DistroKid). Just any song that you don’t really care about and don’t plan to share, like some little instrumental interlude or whatever. This is just a placeholder. Once it’s on Spotify you can go through the Spotify For Artists app and claim the profile. Once you have the profile claimed then you can submit the song for editorial playlists consideration.

Be aware that you need to have the release date for the song you want to submit set a good 4 weeks in advance to give them time to review (1 week at the VERY least). And with the cheapest DistroKid option setting the release date in advance isn’t an option. Not sure how it works with other distribution services."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fel7lvj,t1_fel73cm,1579215792.0,Thanks. It seems like I remember a few comments making that claim on here. I have one song that’s a little over 4 minutes that I think is just a little more palatable than another song I have that’s just a little under 4 minutes.
