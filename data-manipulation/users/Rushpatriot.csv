PowerScaling,febri5h,t1_febr7ke,1578961888.0,Also seeing how Sasuke could keep up for a little while at the summit and also seeing how he is inferior to himself when facing Kabuto..I think that can give you a good idea of how strong edo itachi was.
PowerScaling,febr7ke,t3_eobhag,1578961791.0,"Damn,I think Itachi and Nagato would have it. Seeing how both were sick being alive and edo disregards the sickness as well as limitations. Itachi was shown to be stronger than sasuke when they were fighting Kabuto as well. I think it would be closer than the Madara fight but I can see them pulling it off. The heavier hitters being the Raikage and Hokage...izanmi would help a lot. Getting rid of gaara I feel would be easy for them as well."
PowerScaling,fe8ui0a,t1_fe749ib,1578931089.0,Honestly it's hard to scale kratos like that. I think a better comparison would be Spawn vs Kratos. I could see argument both ways but I would think Kratos. Maybe Asura from Asuras Wrath vs Spawn. That would be a hard one. I would give it to spawn though.
PowerScaling,fdzmj7m,t3_en5gd6,1578791730.0,"Well the God hands arent Gods. They are ""Angels"" or ""Demons"". While Kratos has kill all the Olympian Gods and is currently killing off Norse mythology. We also havent seen too much from the God Hand but the fact that Void had to teleport Skull Knights sword when he attacked shows that they arent immune to damage."

wholesomememes,fdag2vy,t1_fdacqv5,1578245629.0,"I had it so bad to the point I quit my job out of fear. That was 8 months ago and time waits for no man. I had a pretty good grasp on psychology but not anxiety as a whole. I've gained more knowledge on the subject. Now I meditate,work out,go for runs,eat healthier and try to interact with strangers more. I can say it's been pretty peaceful. I have a new job and dont have panic attacks anymore."
wholesomememes,fdabeyv,t1_fda8vby,1578244104.0,Well if that's the case you should definitely learn more about. If I didnt like psychology as much as I do I would've been crippled from general anxiety. Also introversion isnt a bad thing. Probably the main reason you are getting downvotes is because you think anxiety=introversion. Being introverted myself..I can tell you it gets really irritating when people assume introversion is bad. The more you know. : )
wholesomememes,fda7ar1,t1_fda0c81,1578242597.0,I think you should read up on psychology and introversion/extroversion. Maybe look into the personality types. You'll learn a lot about yourself and others obviously you need this if you think a introverted person is social anxiety incarnate.
wholesomememes,fda49sj,t1_fd9vvkn,1578241434.0,If you look into personalities and pychology there is such a thing as a introvert being drained from large social actions and vice-versa for extroverts. This does not mean its anxiety that's a completely different subject.

PowerScaling,fcweoae,t1_fcwe8dg,1578023705.0,"When scaling Zeno do you ever consider that he is bounded by time. Usually when I debate people that miss this very important scale..when compared to reality warpers ,concepts incarnate and outerversal characters. Sense you are a dragon ball tars I'll change the subject.  Do you think that Vegta evolution could have taken god speed dyspo by himself. Personally I dont think he could."
PowerScaling,fcwe9eo,t1_fcwdk28,1578023416.0,So in your opinion even lethality plus extreme speed is > power and haxs. That's pretty interesting. I wish you could scale bleach better I have a good amount of subject I would be up for in debating against Naruto and Dragon Ball. Do you have a favorite debate. I think it would be fun debating against you if you have any ideas?
PowerScaling,fcwe0vj,t1_fcwdkwm,1578023251.0,That's pretty new subject I dont know enough to scale or debate anything but I see countless people talking about scaling it recently.
PowerScaling,fcwdf2b,t1_fcwd1q5,1578022839.0,Really cool bro. I hope you make more scaling post would love to debate about it. Though I'm more on a bleach and HXH crave when it comes too scaling. A little MHA and FMA as well. Heres a question for you think Zeno is as strong as Dr Manhattan? Something I've debated about I believe the majority think Zeno is stronger than he is.

PowerScaling,fcwbrsi,t1_fcwbegz,1578021743.0,Makes sense I feel all might would have to pull out a few United states of smash to be able to get anywhere. a big one made by seth the programmer is minato vs akatsuki. How do you feel about this subject?
PowerScaling,fcwbg54,t1_fcwb3zp,1578021534.0,I'm about the same whereas I enjoy debating dragonball more just because I've been burnt out on Naruto. There is also a lot of idiots in Naruto fandom. How do you feel about Krillin from super vs momoshiki?
PowerScaling,fcwb7wa,t1_fcw9lni,1578021382.0,Oh well I like your scaling that's pretty damn good. The way I see even small amounts of damage done to a slower but stronger charcter would win. Usually speed blitz>over power but it always depends. Even though killua was significantly faster than youpi in HXH he wasnt able to do enough damage. HXH has some very rich lore and is extremely hard to scale because of hax but I love debating it.
PowerScaling,fcwawd4,t1_fcw9p7s,1578021170.0,What's your favorite anime to scale. Also I just recently watched Promised never land have you seen it?
PowerScaling,fcw7t0p,t1_fcw7c3g,1578019117.0,Now that you said that it makes more sense. I still think it's hard to scale sds especially in the late game and I'll have to reread some battle. It's kinda like scaling opm which can also be a headache to scale a long with fma which I've always failed at scaling. Sense you scale sds I'm guessing you watched the latest anime episode..bro that was the worst shit. I've never seen anime that bad.
PowerScaling,fcw7ba4,t1_fcw5ciq,1578018797.0,No I wasnt saying minato is the fastest I was debating on another subject on YouTube and was just wondering what you thought about it. How about this genos at the end of season 2 vs All might in his prime
PowerScaling,fcw74j1,t1_fcw56n5,1578018675.0,Well in the same regard you could say that Meliodas being a force of nature is a description that is define in strength. You have to be so powerful to be able to do this. The scaling is ambiguous and I will look more into to give you more clarity.
PowerScaling,fcw3sm6,t1_fcw0h67,1578016490.0,Heres a question do you think ichigo(BWA) is as fast as Minato? Also do you think Naruto is planetary? The naruto question a lot of people are divided about for some odd reason.
PowerScaling,fcw3nz5,t1_fcw0h67,1578016405.0,I also like Aizen alot but hes hard to scale and it would take a lot to talk about.
PowerScaling,fcw3fe7,t1_fcw0yv8,1578016245.0,"Well that isn't a very good comparison either. It is said verbatim that meliodas is too strong to be in the living realm. The scale is kinda weird in sds but I think they are a lot stronger than people think. Just a small amount of power was able to erase a city from his power. This same power that is suppressed. You would say that edo madara is probably moon level or a little less. Galan has the same feats as madara with cutting a mountain range down with one strike and his power level was only 40,000. Obviously demon king meliodas is far past that. His orginal power level as leader of the ten commandments was 114,000 or 140,000 if I'm not mistaken. So his attack power roughly would be around a country size or continent level at that point. This meliodas doesnt even hold a candle too Demon King meliodas. Honestly though you cant be a demon king unless you can destroy a planet. So in all honesty I think they were being serious when saying he cant be in the dimension. If not then by your logic goku shaking the world of void is featless as well by your logic that is."
wholesomememes,fcvzjhq,t3_ej63u8,1578013682.0,It takes about 3 weeks to develop a habit so trying your best to work out everyday is a good thing.
PowerScaling,fcvysy7,t3_cjfuyj,1578013196.0,Well sense the new manga chapters have come out and the fact that meliodas threatens to destroy the living dimension with him just being there I would say buu saga high balling
PowerScaling,fcvyai0,t3_dz9xo1,1578012861.0,The Beyonders from marvel comics shown to be able to kill the living tribunal a infinite amount of times and the end of the comic it just shows them killing off the multiverse. They come from a different dimension of mulitverses so I would say high outerversal.
PowerScaling,fcvxz4l,t3_eb2ymh,1578012652.0,In pretty sure Monarch would win. Hes won against concepts and outerversal beings as well as other dimensional entities and I dont see zeno taking that on sense hes bounded by time.
PowerScaling,fcvxu2i,t1_fbtd9jo,1578012559.0,The Naruto games arent canon though so that's invalid. Guy has been shown when opening the 8th gate to warp reality when he punches the air with his kicks. Black hole level is kinda of ambiguous though. A better scaling would be star level or High star level. Which in my opinion and what I have learned naruto in canon is around the area of high planet level but that could be debated.
PowerScaling,fcvxc1g,t1_fcvx5mt,1578012231.0,I could say a lot more but it would be easier if you watched comics explained on YouTube where he talks about galactus. He also has another form being God Galactus which also has immense power. For the mcu he would cause just as much trouble as thanos did. Hes what you would call a endgame villain.
PowerScaling,fcvx5mt,t3_eiqcj4,1578012111.0,Well more times than not in the multiverse galaxy is shown to watch the universe die. Also he gained such immense power that he was labeled as a cosmic entity. The reason for this was for balance against the celestials. Hes on par with celestials if that gives you a better idea

fightporn,fcix7ih,t1_fcicuow,1577671976.0,"Thank you sir. You put it in better words than I could. Like I said a street fight is different but there is a reason that professionals feel eachother out at the beginning of a match,yes some matches in fast especially in ufc yet for the most part you will see each fighter feel eachother out. When you watch conferences you dont see the fighters talking about ""oh well this guy is tall so I'm worried about his reach or oh this guy is short so I'm worried about his power."" Yes size is something that someone should take into consideration but if you are a professional...this would be second nature. What a fighter is really worried about is the skill set. The movement of the head,the movement of the feat,the special hand movement that they might use,how they set people up,what to exspect from them. Height and weight is something that is ordinary. A honed skillset is something that professionals truly study and worry about. Many people didnt know that connor mcgregor was as short as he is. Honestly that's because size really doesnt matter at that point."
fightporn,fchvpkq,t1_fchv4ng,1577654697.0,Well it's similar to what people say about mike tyson. Where generally being taller would be an advantage obviously that is not the case with Mike Tyson. You have cases like Anderson silvas reach advantage. But like I said at this point at such a high tier it's about who has more skill. Case and point mike tyson.
fightporn,fcgzrmy,t1_fcfklc3,1577645750.0,Height rarely matter with professional boxers and mma. Its not a street fight high tier fighters are high tier mostly from the skill.
