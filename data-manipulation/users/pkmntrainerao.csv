askgaybros,ff50x9t,t1_ff50dw4,1579577262.0,That's sort of been my approach. If something makes me feel bad about myself I use that as motivation to fix it. I wonder if I take it too far though. People are always talking about accepting things
askgaybros,ff4yr1j,t1_ff4yn3e,1579575683.0,I'd really like that :) I'll message you from time to time to see how you're doing
askgaybros,ff4y3s2,t1_ff4x2s8,1579575233.0,"I know the feeling. I'm shy too and for a while it felt like the only way I knew how to connect with people was through sex. Otherwise I just felt like I never had interesting things to say. We all have a human need to be close to someone and we'll do that in whatever ways we can. I completely understand where you're coming from. Maybe you could meet people who are more at your current stage in life. Sometimes we only have friends for the season we're in. We just have to find them. I know we don't know each other irl but I'd love to keep talking when you have free time. Its seems like we have things in common, plus you like Pokemon like me! It's a match made in heaven"
askgaybros,ff4we0c,t1_ff4vnvj,1579574045.0,"That sounds terrible, you shouldn't have to give  your body away to feel wanted. I'm sure there are people who want you for you. Your family or friends? And sometimes you just have to want yourself. I know that first hand from the times its felt like I've had no one in my corner. My therapist is always telling me to just try engaging people here and there. It can be at the grocery store, the bank, gas station, wherever. I think we all need to feel connected to people. If you try to reach other to people more maybe you'll feel less of a need to give yourself away sexually"
askgaybros,ff4ue6s,t1_ff4tsqj,1579572677.0,"Oh, I have to ask this since this topic was about self esteem and all: does doing that make you feel good about yourself or do you think you're manifesting low self-esteem? I'm not judging or anything I just want to make sure you're doing it because it brings you joy and not because you're coping with something that should be handled differently"
askgaybros,ff4srt2,t1_ff4sjk6,1579571570.0,Money is always a big challenge for couples. You're not alone in that. It's still sad to hear of an otherwise happy couple falling apart because of money. I wish it hadn't happened
askgaybros,ff4sh75,t1_ff4s78d,1579571364.0,"Finding someone who loves you for you is a blessing, especially if your own parents didn't give you that. I'm glad you found one another. I don't think I'm there yet. It does sound like you're quite the talented lover though! Haha!"
askgaybros,ff4rs8u,t1_ff4rf5a,1579570888.0,"Fuck, you've got better luck than me. I never got that kind of action on Grindr. You're good.

I'm sorry things didn't work out with you gf. It sounds like it was for the best though. Plus if you're playing with guys it might cause some schism between you and your gf. Especially if she's not open to that sort of thing.

There's this guy I have a complicated relationship with, but then again, I think I'm the one doing all the complicating"
askgaybros,ff4r7og,t1_ff4r2u6,1579570494.0,Grindr can be so cruel sometimes. When I was using it I had a really hard time too. Grindr is where hope goes to die for people like us. Why you leave your girlfriend?
askgaybros,ff4qygi,t1_ff4qt6g,1579570319.0,You sleeping with anyone particular these days?
askgaybros,ff4qo3x,t1_ff4q96v,1579570124.0,We seem to have a lot in common. I like you pics and videos ;)
askgaybros,ff4q3rr,t1_ff4q1af,1579569734.0,How did that help? Wouldn't that just expose to you more rejection?
askgaybros,ff4pz9k,t1_ff4ppzz,1579569645.0,"I don't have much of a social circle now but it seems like it's an important part of being a human. Maybe I need to work on that. I'm preparing to return to school now, maybe I'll find some people I click with"
askgaybros,ff4ppfg,t1_ff4p9si,1579569456.0,"We all poop. Ha, I needed to hear that given that day I've had. Sometimes it's hard because there are two standards I try to live up too. The one set by other people and the one set by myself. I never seem to live up to either. I take your advice to heart though and try to work with it"
askgaybros,ff44aqd,t1_ff0a30s,1579555224.0,It will get better. Don't give up :)
askgaybros,ff2hpd7,t1_ff2h84p,1579506609.0,Okay I got what you mean. I don't know with him honestly. He's an enigma
askgaybros,ff2hm18,t1_ff2h1na,1579506493.0,"I'll try to remember I'm more than what I look like. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts in the past. More than anything I just want to have a normal life. I want to have people, love, and connections. When you've been so low you want to die, you'll find you'll do anything, no matter how risky, to get up from that place. If having a small penis makes me sad and keeps me from finding love, I'll take the risks and get an implant.

I'm happy you've come to terms with your status and have managed to find connections. Of course now you can take medication and it's like you don't even have the disease. I understand there is still stigma and it's something you can't change. I'm glad you've made peace with it

And yeah that's just a gross video of me masturbating. I'll probably take it down eventually. Thanks for the compliment though!"
askgaybros,ff2h4f9,t1_ff2h195,1579505890.0,I said I would NOT say he is mine. I don't think I'm big enough for him. He talked about his last partner being small
askgaybros,ff2gzav,t1_ff2gx9q,1579505715.0,"No, it's a fwb situation. We've grown somewhat close however. I definitely wouldn't say he's mine"
askgaybros,ff2gwmb,t1_ff2gtyh,1579505624.0,Attraction is complicated and it might just be that he's attracted to big dicks.
askgaybros,ff2gt14,t1_ff2gqtv,1579505501.0,When he brings it up I'll ask him if he wishes I was bigger. It's not that easy to leave when you care about someone
askgaybros,ff2gi7q,t1_ff2gf2s,1579505137.0,The guy I'm with is always talking about penis size... It makes me self conscious
askgaybros,ff2fbpb,t1_ff2er9k,1579503746.0,If it will give me a better life and a chance of attracting a partner I'll do it as soon as I have the capacity to
askgaybros,ff2f6cz,t1_ff2f09z,1579503577.0,So I just lost the lottery? Is that really it?
askgaybros,ff2euv6,t1_ff2eqmz,1579503214.0,Can tight underwear really do that?
askgaybros,ff283gq,t1_ff22997,1579496544.0,Very apt. I need to get it together..
askgaybros,ff1yh8i,t1_ff1x2w2,1579489091.0,"I know... monogamy just feels like a lot to ask of someone, especially a gay man. It seem like its just part of life that gay men want to sleep with a lot of people. In a way, by expressing I'm unhappy with him sleeping with other people, I feel like I'm trying to clip his wings or selfishly deprive him of something good. I also doubt if I'll be enough for him if I ask him to be monogamous. Both attractive enough and sexually proficient enough. Then finally, he's my first guy and the closest thing I've ever had to a bf. I don't know anything but him. I'm afraid of losing him. I guess I have a lot of my own shit to work through."
askgaybros,ff1u0vu,t1_ff1rq7h,1579486167.0,"I think I want to sleep with someone who I sleep with exclusively, and who sleeps with me exclusively. I just don't feel I have a right to give him ultimatums and request he only sleep with me. I've tried to leave a million times. It's an utter joke at this point. I'm guess I just don't have what it takes to stand up for myself"
askgaybros,ff1tlnz,t1_ff1t3xj,1579485891.0,"I'm so bad at leaving him. I've tried and he convinces me not to. I guess I'm easy to convince because my heart isn't fully decided on leaving him. Plus I like him, and he claims to like me. I feel guilty about walking away from something potentially positive. This is hard for me -_-"
askgaybros,ff1t0zf,t1_ff1q9q0,1579485526.0,"No, I haven't asked because I don't want to burden him. In a way I don't feel like I'm worth being monogamous with. If it doesn't come from him to want to be monogamous with me then I don't feel I have the right to put a chain on his dick."
askgaybros,ff1shp1,t3_er2a1o,1579485190.0,"I've been there and done that. At 28 I'm just trying to pick things up again but I'm years behind my peers. Trust me. You. Will. Be. Sorry. All sorts of horrible things will happen. You'll end up poor and dependent on people. You'll get treated like shit and have no recourse. Everyone around you will advance while you stay down. If there is any sense of self preservation left in you, do everything you can to avoid fleeing. Seek out help from whomever you can. Make up excuses to cover your ass if you have to. Just try to finish. I'm rooting for you."
askgaybros,ff1qjop,t3_er36l2,1579483968.0,Superficial
askgaybros,ff1q5gr,t3_eqzvwo,1579483714.0,If you like the idea of it and feel it suits you you'll probably like it when it happens. Bottoming definitely entails some discomfort. It's not this intrinsically magical activity. Your affinity for bottom starts in the mind. I've definitely had some uncomfortable bottoming experiences but I keep doing it because it just suits me on a mental level. Its like what I'm supposed to do.
askgaybros,ff1p1n3,t1_ff1olop,1579483003.0,I've tried to leave before and he claims to care about me so much and convinces me not to go. I almost don't know how to leave him
askgaybros,ff1nxpj,t3_er4agn,1579482332.0,So that's the reason I'm undateable. People must get weirded out because I don't have friends. I didn't realize how much I was being judged because of that
askgaybros,ff1n3ho,t1_ff1m00b,1579481922.0,"Yeah, I guess I just have to be brave enough to leave and find someone else. I've gotten comfortable with him and the idea of getting back out there seems hard. Plus he took my virginity and I've known him two years"

askgaybros,fezsyl6,t3_er0ddg,1579461252.0,"Oh my goodness, I'm at the exact same stage with someone now and I've experienced all the same emotions you have. Literally, especially the part where you said if he takes too long to respond to a text you get paranoid he's with someone else. I feel so lame and needy during those moments. I didn't realize anyone else felt that way.

Anyway, I hate this stage too. I sort of cope with it by reminding myself he's not my lover, not my bf, not my husband. I keep waiting for the end. It's going to be forever or it's going to go down in flames. I tell myself we're perfect strangers even though we're not. It's just my way of coping. When I tell myself its probably over I comfort myself by letting myself remember that I at least got to love him, hold him, kiss him, etc. for however long I have. Try to just live in the moment and not think too far ahead or expect things with this one, okay?"
TopsAndBottoms,feykrow,t1_fexb4lc,1579446911.0,"No, I've never had one before. I try to take care of my body by exercising good bathroom habits. Not straining, cleaning myself gently, taking fiber, etc. How do you avoid them?"
TopsAndBottoms,feyjhxb,t1_fexbwuf,1579446315.0,"Lol, that's hot. You and your partner sound like interesting lovers. I want to be like you two :)"
TopsAndBottoms,feyj6v8,t1_fey0wf5,1579446173.0,"Thank you for letting me know that. I've always wondered how I would know when I've gotten a tear. That's probably the only limit I have. Lol, you think biting a pillow would help?"
askgaybros,fewrair,t1_fewko10,1579418320.0,Grindr makes me feel like trash. I am nothing there but a square inch photo and some stats
askgaybros,fewr6rh,t1_fevozvh,1579418276.0,But I think to conflates everyone's issues together you lose the specific elements of this problem that affect gay men disproportionately
askgaybros,fewqs2m,t1_fesdlxz,1579418099.0,"Oh my god, my stomach is a constant source of dissatisfaction for me. I'm already a thin person who eats very little but I'm trying keto diet and calorie deficits just to try to get rid of it"
askgaybros,fewqeyj,t3_eqh6cw,1579417935.0,"Like I look at big dicks on Reddit, but then I have feel bad because I don't have a big dick. It's weird be attracted to what you are"
TopsAndBottoms,fewi26b,t1_fevzgj7,1579410955.0,"Yeah, that's usually what I try to focus on. I guess I'm a fool for sacrifice"
TopsAndBottoms,fevvngd,t1_fevq7qo,1579401992.0,"Maybe so, but either way I don't like to disappoint him. He likes just being able to go crazy. For the most part I enjoy it and for the times I'm not I'm having fun knowing he's feeling good."
askgaybros,fepc39o,t1_fepabvb,1579316879.0,And you'd consider yourself fem?
TopsAndBottoms,fenrwqb,t3_eq0wl7,1579289897.0,"I like the idea of being feminized during sex too but I don't think my top likes it. He lets me call my hole a pussy but he doesn't seem to latch on when I start saying things like ""Let's fuck like we're trying to get pregnant,"" or ""You should be the father of my children."" Maybe it's just because he doesn't want kids supposedly"
askgaybros,fee1s65,t1_fedt7oz,1579024606.0,"I don't believe relationships have to end terribly, but I believe their is a certain amount of distance that one should place between himself and his ex after the relationship is over. I think that's necessary in order to move forward and have healthy relationships in the future. If you're still hanging out with your ex to the degree my guy was that's an indicator that he still feels something and isn't completely ready to start something new with me. If you're still doing bf things with that person you are still in a relationship for all intent and purposes. The only thing missing is sex. My guy spent Xmas with his parents and his ex. Not me. So maybe he liked his ex more than me. I don't know how that makes me insecure when I'm simply reacting to his problematic behaviors."
askgaybros,fecrh3h,t1_fecr212,1578981847.0,I didn't dictate that he couldn't be friends with him but the relationship made me uncomfortable. Personally I can't be with someone who is still in a relationship with their ex
askgaybros,fecqktm,t1_fecq76h,1578980978.0,Thank you for telling me that. I needed to hear that
askgaybros,fe6j5s1,t1_fe6habt,1578892587.0,I'm sensitive and I over analyze everything. I cut people off when I feel they've hurt my feelings or they don't make me feel positive emotionally. I'm awkward and have weird mannerisms. I've got major self-esteem issues as well as body dysmorphia. Struggled with anxiety and depression in the past

askgaybros,fe5r61e,t1_fe5elin,1578873403.0,Real friends won't care what you look like. Try making small talk more often with strangers just to practice your social skills. I've got the same problem as you but no matter what we just can't give up
askgaybros,fe5qg34,t1_fe5o7yr,1578873117.0,I'm sure no one thinks you're a monster. You look like just a regular person. You should be able to make nice friends and function in society. You can't be so hard on yours you know
askgaybros,fe5q6qm,t1_fe5oyg2,1578873011.0,That's no way to live life :(
askgaybros,fe5q5k7,t1_fe5ph7l,1578872993.0,I can relate. I've got some acne scars on my face and hyperpigmentation on my legs. I've spent hundreds of dollars to help improve the appearance of them. I just can't accept them. I have to work on them. They make me feel really ugly and unattractive
askgaybros,fe58i04,t1_fe4m6ql,1578866584.0,Listening to music helps me deal with life. I'm definitely going to give them a listen :)
askgaybros,fe588ty,t1_fe4p05j,1578866507.0,"That's an interesting perspective. I never thought about that. I mean, I'm sure it's better to be attractive in general, but I guess there would be a downside to it. It might be harder to find people who like you for you and not because you're eye candy"
askgaybros,fe4l3v7,t1_fe3zmkk,1578860473.0,I'm happy someone admits it :)
askgaybros,fe4kxhq,t1_fe46d5r,1578860417.0,Ikr! Men in general are visual but I think gay men take it further. Our eyes really determine what we find attractive. Thank you for your advice. I hope one day I'll be okay with my look too. That day certainly isn't today or even tomorrow though.
askgaybros,fe4kgfk,t1_fe4czu9,1578860229.0,But everyone needs someone. Dont you worry that will make you unacceptable to people? We all have to conform a little bit in order to be socially and sexually acceptable
askgaybros,fe2loci,t1_fe0p785,1578840071.0,I like this approach. I was doing keto for a while but fell off because it's so strict. I'll try again though
askgaybros,fe2lh63,t1_fe16r49,1578839960.0,"I don't feel pressure because my type looks a certain way, I feel pressure because I want to be acceptable in general... Looking good gets you positive social and sexual interactions. I want those so I can feel like I belong I guess"
askgaybros,fe2kafx,t1_fe1df66,1578839422.0,"That's an interesting way of looking at it. I'm not 6 feet tall, white, or athletic either. I'm an ugly black guy. I still feel pressure to look as perfect as I possibly can"
askgaybros,fe2jksw,t1_fe1xyla,1578839146.0,Meaning attraction is based largely on what they see instead of other factors
askgaybros,fe2jd96,t1_fe21ov1,1578839064.0,"I wonder how much of this is in our heads and how much of it is objectively real. Attractive people definitely get more attention on Grindr that's a fact. Looking better would help get more attention. But in your case, I hope you'll at least try to put yourself out there more even if it means finding rejection occasionally"
askgaybros,fe2h4pl,t1_fe1b6d6,1578838304.0,Oh my gosh I totally relate. Seeing different perspectives of my face and body give me a meltdown

TopsAndBottoms,fda0ifp,t3_ekdffd,1578240321.0,I like being a dedicated total bottom. It's all I really want to do. I'd like a guy who is a dedicated total top. That way I know he's not likely to ask me to top. Plus I like the idea of a guy who gets off only by sticking his dick in things. It's the opposite of me and I find that so sexy
depression,fcrxcat,t1_fcrr5md,1577907914.0,"Of course, it's a normal feeling. I've felt that way before too. I'm saying that it's a feeling we should fight against, not give into."
depression,fcrqs3e,t1_fcrpzbo,1577905363.0,"Well, stop taking it for granted. Value what you have and be thankful you're not in the same position as the people you pity. Because you have your health you should value it even more because its something not everyone has and they would love to have what you have.

askgaybros,fcrmula,t1_fcr9492,1577903879.0,I think I feel that. When I have him I definitely don't want to let him go. Sometimes when we're together we won't want to part but I'll tell him he has to because he has things to do the next day
askgaybros,fcrkfnj,t1_fcr8tcf,1577902981.0,"I like him a lot, I'm just trying to be careful about letting myself get too excited about him as a defense mechanism.

TopsAndBottoms,fcimrld,t3_ehc4fa,1577665170.0,"I have low self-esteem. I didn't exactly ask for this. My low self-esteem is the result of trauma and other negative experiences from my earlier life that weren't under my control. There are also present day factors that make me feel bad about myself. I take medications and see multiple therapists regularly but it's still something I struggle with. When people give me compliments I don't believe them. I just assume they're patronizing me. Its just how I feel. 

That said, having low self-esteem also motivates me. It's a kind of mental pain, so in order to get out of pain I want to improve myself and find solutions to problems so one day I'll feel better. 

People are who they are and you have to accept that. We all struggle with different things in our own ways and I think most people sometimes doubt themselves. If you don't find people struggling with this problem attractive then leave them alone. Just try not to judge them"

askgaybros,fc21712,t1_fc1wlrz,1577336409.0,"Hmm, that's challenging but I see what you mean. Basically, if the risks outweigh the possible benefits it's best to accept whatever it is that's bothering me. That doesn't necessarily bar surgery. My crooked teeth weren't causing problems but they weren't aesthetic so I had them fixed. It took that same attitude with my surgery. Don't know if it paid off though"
TopsAndBottoms,fc1w53z,t1_fc1vt7c,1577331556.0,That's a negative way to look at it. I think it's called courting and it's existed since the beginning of human history. You put on your best self to attract a mate. There really isn't anything manipulative or dishonest about it. I don't think there's anything selfish about loving someone and wanting them to love you back. I think that's very normal actually. You sound bitter
askgaybros,fc1uklq,t1_fc1u9ob,1577330184.0,"I think that's the problem. I didn't exactly get the results I had hoped for from the surgery. Maybe the solution is to go under the knife again, but with an even better surgeon. I'm already trying to make arrangements 4 weeks out just to cope with the disappointment. I have to feel like I'm doing something to make it better or else I just want to die"
TopsAndBottoms,fc1uda5,t1_fc1tkbh,1577330000.0,Not really. I guess it's just a sex thing with us. We've started doing a few things outside of sex though. We've hung out at his place a few times. We even ate together twice. He's shown me his collection of cars. Maybe we're evolving?
askgaybros,fc1u6hr,t1_fc1tpxf,1577329833.0,"I feel like this is a really great start, but then there's a conundrum.

My genetics predestined me to have really crooked teeth. I got braces though and even permanent retainers and now my teeth are straight and normal. A lot of people do this.

My genetics predisposed me to depression and ADHD. I take man made medications to combat then.

Genetically my skin is prone to terrible acne but I smear powerful chemicals over my face every night to fix that.
