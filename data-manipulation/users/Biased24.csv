They are very loud, IMO.

Let your ears heal, then wear them until you get some discomfort, take them off. Try again later, repeat. If you're in pain as soon as you put them on, you either have the wrong size of ear tips, or your ears are shaped weird.

Honestly, the nuranow subscription is great. After 2 years you get a new set (and 2 years of nuranow is cheaper than buying them outright, at least in australia), so essentially you're ""buying"" a new set every 2 years at a discount. And when you don't want to pay for it any more, you send them back. which is fine by me because if I'm not paying for it, I probably don't use them either. so I'm not missing out on anything by returning them.

I will never be caught wearing a dress or skirt unless it's cosplay or someshit, and I think people should be able to do and be who they want and wear what they want without it reflecting on their identity they are just themselves.

Along side that using the whole ""oh growing up I always wanted me hair long and the colour pink and barbies"" to voice being trans is valid. Because along with that is the whole just knowing you aren't that gender, it's not only the things they do or say it's what they are. With material thing there is also pronouns and that shits important.

I don't know how to word this exactly because it's an abstract and complex topic wrapped in another one. But they can correlate but also not be indicative of one another. It can also be a starting point or big ass flag saying see proof."
