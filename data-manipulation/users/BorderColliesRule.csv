*UltraVan - Aircraft designer David Peterson created this monocoque-framed motorhome, built using aircraft methods.[113] The early Travalon models built by the Prescolite Corporation were used as mobile showrooms. The UltraVan models were built by Ultra Inc. The vehicles were powered by either the 110 hp (82.0 kW) or, later, an optional 140 hp (104.4 kW) version of the Corvair flat-six engine. Weighing about 3,500 lb (1,587.6 kg), the Ultravan could cruise at 60 mph (97 km/h) and return fuel economy in the range of 15â€“20 mpgâ€‘US (16â€“12 L/100 km; 18â€“24 mpgâ€‘imp).*

Zhang Zongchang was described as having ""the physique of an elephant, the brain of a pig and the temperament of a tiger"". Writer Lin Yutang called Zhang ""the most colorful, legendary, medieval, and unashamed ruler of modern China"". Former Emperor Puyi remembered Zhang as ""a universally detested monster"" whose ugly, bloated face was ""tinged with the livid hue induced by heavy opium smoking"". A brutal man, Zhang was notorious for his hobby of splitting the skulls of prisoners with his sword, which he called ""smashing melons"". He loved to boast about the size of his penis, which become part of his legend. He was nicknamed ""General Eighty-Six"" as his penis when erect was said to measure up to a pile of 86 Mexican silver dollars.[9] He kept some 30 to 50 concubines of different nationalities, who were given numbers since he could not remember their names nor speak their language. He was free with his gifts, lavishly squandering money and concubines on superiors and friends. As a result, his commanders were very loyal to him, contributing to his military success.*

LessCredibleDefence,fdydh9t,t1_fdx3xom,1578778602.0,"> Soleimani was the element preventing a re-alignment of forces within the Iranian government. He was too influential and too powerful. With him gone the free play is in effect. He had to go for anything to happen and I think it was Iranians who leaked to Americans the time at which it is ""safe"" to kill Soleimani - meaning that they are prepared to distract the other side

I have a pet theory along these same lines; ie, internal power struggle within Iran and getting rid of Soleimani via the US was an end-goal. No Americans or allies were killed during the Iranian response and allegedly they were warned by the Iranians prior to launch. 

Now everyone gets to take a â€œdeep breathâ€ and step back and thus a full conflict is *avoided*."
