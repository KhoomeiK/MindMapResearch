unpopularopinion,ffrklc4,t1_ffr55k1,1580159950.0,"I totally understand what you are saying about spanking and beating, however my parents thought they were spanking.  I guessing the definition for some people is blurred. I’m not against a little swat with a hand only, and only on a bottom, but to what age is spanking useful?  Grounding can be much worse than spanking to elementary age children.  I did swat my older children some but gradually stop.  I didn’t feel good about doing it.  Too much physical punishment, along with pointing out to the child how bad they are is damaging."

unpopularopinion,ffp11kn,t3_eu6sfk,1580084130.0,"Children don’t need to be spanked or beaten.  Many people don’t know the difference.  There are other ways to teach children right from wrong.  Growing up with parents who believed  children needed  physical discipline I can tell you it can causes emotional damage to a child.  My father only spanked us when he was really angry. He used a belt that left welts that often turned to bruises.  He often felt bad afterwards and would apologize.  He would say, “I’m sorry I had to spank you, but you made so angry”.  Then I had two things to deal with.; The physical pain and the mental and emotional pain.  I felt like I must be a terrible child to cause my dad to be so angry.  I thought it was all my fault.  As a young adult it took me a long time to understand that no one can make me angry unless I let them.  I have carried a lot of guiltily feeling that when something goes wrong, no matter what it is, somehow I’m responsible.  It taken time to undo this wrong thinking.

Being afraid of physical punishment didn’t stop me from doing things wrong, it just made me more careful and i lied better. I never really did anything too bad or got in trouble,but I did do things they wouldn’t have approved of.   

I know what I say won’t change anyone’s opinion.  I argued the topic enough with parents because they thought I didn’t spank my children enough.  My children have turned out as responsible caring adults even if I didn’t “spank them enough”.

There are better ways to teach children than physical punishment."

I knew a couple in their 70’s whose family had raised cattle for 3 or 4 generations.  They always had what they thought were the best cattle dogs.  They were smart and took to heading the cows naturally.   One cold winter day  the couple were headed out to check on and feed the herd.  Cause it was so cold the pickup heater wasn’t getting the cab of the truck warm so the wife said “I sure wish  Rascal would move over on top of my feet so they would warm up”.   Immediately Rascal the amazingly smart cattle dog got up,moved over and sit on feet.  Coincidence or does Rascal understand spoken language!"
