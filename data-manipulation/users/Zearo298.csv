Pour time and effort into making your Sims look and dress *just* the right way, building and furnishing a house perfectly to a style, including CASTing everything to match (I’m still stuck on TS3.)

Sometimes I catch myself tweaking a Sim’s face forever, checking the clock, and getting upset that I spent all my “play” time just fucking around trying to get a face right, but then I have to calm myself down and remind myself that that’s exactly what the enjoyable part is for me.

delusionalartists,ffpqdho,t1_ffnsttx,1580102050.0,"I suppose the point is that the effect he’s creating is meant to look like a completely different medium, except worse, while charging a price similar to what someone may pay for the real deal (though we don’t see listed prices, so this is an assumption, he does state he is cheap, but that’s a relative concept, and of course he’d never say he’s expensive).

The kind of photo manipulation you seem to be talking about is the only way to get that result, regardless of how difficult it is or not, this guy is trying to pass a digital sham for what should be a lovingly created work of art, which one could argue your pet deserves that depiction instead of a cash grab by a charlatan, but the manipulative phrasing used by the snake oil salesman cons the buyers into thinking they’re getting something lovingly made with effort instead of coming out and saying “pay me x dollars and I’ll slap a filter on your photo and go to Staples to print it!”. 

He doesn’t outright say the photos are drawings, but he doesn’t deny it, and at no point states that it’s a digital production, and that could just as easily be to cover his ass from accusations as it could be an accident. Maybe it’s obvious I’m a cynic. He could easily still make his efforts seem intensive while being honest about how he is creating them, but he doesn’t.
