LifeProTips,ffkbito,t1_ffjy5d1,1580020071.0,"I've spent a fair bit of time learning and using bash scripting but it just feels too frustrating for anything longer than several lines of code. I've heard good things about Power Shell, is it really a pleasure to use or is that just a perception because Windows users don't really have alternatives?"
science,ffhmhxe,t1_ffhkfpz,1579942385.0,"Fear isn't about risk though, it's often about being caught in a situation where you're completely helpless. With death by traffic, animals, guns, we perceive having a bit more feedback or possible prevention then getting blown up by a bomb or catching a dangerous virus where there's nothing you can do and the doctors don't know much either."

Every place allows you to be you, you just have to accept the consequences of being authentic or inauthentic. Also, being yourself doesn't mean being the you that would be present under ideal circumstances. Nothing in life is ideal, the world isn't suppressing the real you, you are letting the world suppress the real you, therefore you are the one suppressing yourself and blaming the world.

Also, being authentic isn't about how it looks, you can totally be not wearing what you would like to wear while being authentic. If you think compromising or doing something unnatural or uncomfortable is inauthentic then what you think is inauthentic is entirely defined by the perception of others, which doesn't have much to do with yourself but your projection of what other people think. The remainder you call authenticity is then much smaller than what's actually available for you."

IWantToLearn,ff2puo3,t1_fezq73r,1579518460.0,What's your take on friends that are good to you but chemistry is just lacking or you just don't really care either way if you have an active friendship or not? Does investing in them detract from spending time finding friends who are a better match?
Salsa,fewkfgj,t3_eqp9xr,1579412601.0,It would make a huge difference (in my opinion) if there were timestamps listed for each main question in the interview.
infp,fepwqnr,t3_eq8drf,1579333665.0,And when are you available?
GetMotivated,fenwb98,t1_fenc3k9,1579291792.0,"I'm very curious, people who were rude to you before and nice to you after weight loss, are you put off by their shallowness of their change in behavior? Would it be an obstacle for you to date someone like that or would you be more like ""if he's treating me better now then I guess it's fine""?"
AskReddit,fe1hx0b,t1_fe04j8s,1578826740.0,You can whisper it to me and I'll be the judge.
AskReddit,fe1g3pa,t1_fe0f2to,1578826126.0,I'm gonna be honest. This doesn't instinctively register as sexual harassment for me. Partly because pick-up lines aren't sexual harassment. I looked up the formal definition now and sexual harassment has to be repeated behavior unless it has a seriously harmful effect. Can the best or worst pickup line have a seriously harmful effect under normal circumstances?
AskReddit,fe1eos7,t1_fe0duyz,1578825656.0,"Awkwardness is an internal experience. If you don't make it awkward, even if she behaves awkwardly, if you don't feel awkward (and you don't feel awkward by owning what you are responsible and not trying to own what is not in your control) then it's not awkward. If that makes sense."
GetMotivated,fe0mry7,t1_fe0m4ik,1578816212.0,">Remember that you are not responsible for what other people think. 

I've come across this idea many times but the way you put it has made me see it in a way I never have before."
IWantToLearn,fdy3o8b,t3_enauiq,1578775742.0,An example would be helpful to show just how simple we're talking.

OldSchoolCool,fdxwgi8,t1_fdwofqb,1578773605.0,This has inspired me to go and approach strangers until I end up meeting you ;)
funny,fdv9ykh,t1_fdv1s4f,1578745158.0,"I think in the past when I paid and momentarily forget about collecting my purchase it's because I'm anxious about interacting with the cashier and I'm thinking ""act normal, don't be awkward, whew I survived that now time to escape""."
