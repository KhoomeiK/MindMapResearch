10% fees and then 3% to the main eBay payment processor... who is owned by eBay. I wouldn't mind but eBay sellers have literally no rights in comparison to buyers. Someone returned a worthless pair of trainers to me instead of the £250 pair I sent out to them.

Even with video evidence of me opening the parcel and going to the police (under eBay instruction), they still put up arguments to try and get me to quit out. In the end I didn't have to refund the scammer... but eBay refunded them out of their own pocket! So the scammer still won in the end."

Doesn't matter if it's within a few hours or days - as is sometimes the case - later. I wonder if it's a sync issue with my account..."
GMail,fdsg9dp,t1_fdsfy01,1578702119.0,">So, to ""move""something out of the inbox, add the label you want the email to show up under and then archive it. Or, use the 'move to' command.

This is what I do on my phone and when I open gmail on a desktop browser the emails will still show up in primary/inbox and social/promo/updates/forums, but they will have the label highlighted on them that I actually clicked 'move to'.

It's only on a desktop that I can really move them to the label I want and actually 'file' them away. It's very odd, I've looked through my app settings and can't seem to figure out why I can label and move on the gmail app, but they both do the same function. It would appear that the move to feature isn't working as intended."
