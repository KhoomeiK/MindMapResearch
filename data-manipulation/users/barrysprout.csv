todayilearned,fdk8g14,t3_elpejn,1578498449.0,It's a shame we can't expand this to include the world and include all disgusting sensationalised news.

todayilearned,fcmlrsv,t1_fclkms0,1577780644.0,Oh man!!! I remember the shitstank now!! I forgot for like 27 years.
todayilearned,fc6hcla,t1_fc6h0tz,1577480595.0,I was gonna say that but I thought nobody would have seen it. I found it in a VHS bargain bin.
todayilearned,fc5tlq2,t3_egcbea,1577465594.0,Hate speech.. Yea fine. Talking poo. Get it off the screen.
todayilearned,fc5t6va,t1_fc5onyt,1577465324.0,George lucas is a creative and he gave people this world they are obsessed with. You can't tell a creative he has to stop creating or stop using technologies he wished he would have had back when he made the first movie. Nobody is owed anything.
todayilearned,fc5szj7,t1_fc5lhql,1577465192.0,If that guy took it that badly.. I think he overestimates his contribution to the movie.
todayilearned,fc5sqhq,t1_fc5ntnm,1577465029.0,He was bullied by the world though. For something he thought would earn him love and respect. Very Confusing.
todayilearned,fc5slbl,t1_fc5p4ki,1577464936.0,He's great in the green hornet
