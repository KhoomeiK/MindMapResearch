Their policy was to not give generals any power and only have bureaucrats. They wanted to prevent any possibilities of warlords becoming a thing. The Tang dynasty or Han Dynasty with Song era technology would have beaten the Mongols and Jin(Manchurian). Maybe Mongols would have never invaded the middle east if they were challenged in their homelands.
