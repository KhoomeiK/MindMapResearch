sadcringe,ffbabu2,t1_ffadc5d,1579757228.0,I agree with you but you're assuming they never had any such interactions at all. That was the whole point of my comment.

Isn't this exactly what I said? We can't really say given the information told us.

Yes, it's a sad situation, but you're not out of hope even if they were ""perfect""."
sadcringe,ff9slyg,t1_ff9l61k,1579720344.0,"Since when can you not love someone who doesn't love you back? It's unrequited, but infatuation is only an interest or admiration over a short time. It's hard to claim something about another person's situation."
sadcringe,ff9scex,t1_ff9oc14,1579720159.0,"That sounds very similar to a situation I had before, just I'm only partway through. Makes me feel better knowing it's normal to still feel sad from time to time"

exchristian,fep6lp7,t3_eq4ga8,1579313295.0,"I've always had this theory that people thought I was a model christian in high school because I didn't care for sex. Turns out I'm an Ace and I never felt obliged in the first place to ""control sexual urges""."
HumansBeingBros,fep5muq,t1_feoz4tg,1579312666.0,"Apologies for being blunt, but are you really this stupid? Have you never travelled outside the states? That's the case for nearly every country around the world

Btw, 32/33 developed countries have free health care. For those 32 countries you're paying the same whether you go to the hospital or not. Also, for some strange reason, American health care is so expensive that the average person pays significantly less through taxes in other countries. This is despite the theoretical outcome of free health care that should be slightly more for the majority to offset the expensive outliers."
HumansBeingBros,fep511z,t1_feogkax,1579312277.0,"I choked on a piece of steak! It was a piece of mostly fat that must have partially split when I was chewing it and turned into a deadly long piece. Thought I was swallowing a small little bit of fat in my mouth when it pulled everything else with it and got lodged at the top of my throat feeling like the bottom was dangling right where my larynx is. I still don't fully understand how it happened but when other methods didn't work right away my brother was able to reach into my mouth and pull it out. Don't know how safe that maneuver would be but it worked perfectly.

I still have the image of the piece that came out and I think I was 12 or 13 at the time. One of the freakiest moments of my life."

ComedyCemetery,fedg279,t1_fed3gw5,1579010553.0,"That might also be because the traits most find ""cute"" are juvenile traits, the type of things seen in babies of nearly any species.

canada,fe8jjux,t1_fe7p70b,1578926838.0,"Depending on what you have, it is emergency alerts and will likely be in your apps & notifications or sounds settings (for me sounds, but I think most models have it in notifications). You may also be in your developer settings which require to be turned on, I believe this depends on your phone so I'd google that if you can't find it elsewhere."
canada,fe54r2e,t1_fe534ur,1578865646.0,"I'd still see it when I get up because I only have the noise turned off. I'm all for the alerts, but not the ear screeching noise in the middle of the night when it wouldn't even apply to me yet"
canada,fe54hn5,t1_fe3z23g,1578865556.0,"My phone is also not rooted either. The only challenge is unlocking developer options which only requires a google search

Edit: in case you ever see this since you didn't seem to like my response, the solution you provided is a much more complicated solution to the problem that allows you more options for what to do with it. If you want to turn off the noise of the alarm it really is simple and built into your android phone without any need for rooting"
canada,fe3x4yv,t1_fe2a95s,1578853646.0,"Btw, there's a setting in android phones to turn off the emergency alarm. You can disable just the sound which is what I have done."
canada,fe3vrv7,t1_fe27vai,1578853306.0,I've had the same problem with the amber alerts. Getting notified about amber alerts that are literally impossible for them to get to me within that time. Being woken up early morning hours for another impossible one the night before an important exam prompted me to turn them off. Still get the notifications but I'll see them when I'm up and actually able to do something.
FunnyandSad,fdz5wxj,t1_fdz4evm,1578787043.0,"Hm, about half is kinda like that so maybe if you'd rather avoid that type of plotline then it wouldn't be for you.

On the other hand I still think the show has offered more when it comes to the setting and world of star wars than possibly any of the movies thus far, so it could still be nice to watch even if the plot isn't your thing."
FunnyandSad,fdz2m4u,t1_fdyx1yg,1578786013.0,"I think you heard wrong because that's not what the show is about. Baby Yoda is not a major aspect of it. If you're a star wars fan I highly recommend because it gives you a star wars setting that feels both real and believable. If you're not a star wars fan you may still enjoy it depending on what you like, but I wouldn't recommend in this case."

space,fds1ibp,t1_fdrh0jh,1578692919.0,"It's impressive to intern at NASA, but that's not what the title is about. Discovering a planet isn't as major an accomplishment many here are making it out to be. Typically students do discover a lot of planets due to the tedious work being handed off to them. This teen isn't the first nor will he be the last teen to discover a planet, however they are lucky that they got the coverage instead."
space,fds0zad,t1_fdqumpi,1578692590.0,"As someone in the sciences, anyone who would choose to ignore something should be weeded out very early on.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdadr53,t1_fdad3im,1578244927.0,"Anti. It was a few months ago so I don't recall the specific words but she said something to the extent of ""the police should kill all the protesters"".

politics,fczd1xp,t1_fczbn4g,1578098488.0,"Iran is a quarter the size of the US. It's huge and nearly three times larger in population than Iraq. Iran is also a lot more organized and not hated by its people as was the case with Afghanistan and Iraq.

If America enters a war with Iran it will be much deadlier and harder than Iraq. Would it still be doable? Of course, but you're downplaying them significantly."
AskReddit,fcxmug4,t1_fcx9ijm,1578066715.0,"Could she have been nervous? I find it strange how she didn't show this behaviour during the year you knew her. I know some people who tend to babble when they are nervous, but they wouldn't normally behave like that."
AmItheAsshole,fcvx4tc,t1_fcvd9kd,1578012097.0,"My thoughts exactly. The $35/hour is ridiculous because she's not losing that much, unless she was charging only for 8 hours a day or something along those lines. I'm assuming she's getting more than 4 hours of sleep and not skipping all break times (meals, morning and evening prep)."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcvugu9,t1_fcvruh8,1578010372.0,"Well yes, but Asian as an ethnicity does not mean ""from the continent of Asia"".

Those from Southeast Asia are the most commonly considered ""Asian"" in ethnicity followed by those from East Asia. This is nearly unanimous between every country. India is in a bit of a middle ground. 

Originally the idea of such broad ethnicity was based on where such people ""originated"". There are many errors that were discovered with this sort of idea, for example caucasian was those from the caucus mountains, yet it's known now that this isn't the case for the majority of those considered ""white"". However this is still the basis of many modern ethnicities today. So why is india in the middle ground? Because they aren't really any of the original proposed groups. In fact, from a technical standpoint they would be closer related to those from the caucus, or caucasians. 

So onto the conclusion, from where ""Asian"" comes from, India wouldn't be included, much like how the middle east, central asia, and Russia are also not included. However, most countries now officially have a stance on this and include India with the countries of Eastern and Southeastern countries, yet there are still some that do not include India.

tl;dr, if you consider Indian to be Asian, you are in the majority, yet you would also not be wrong to consider them as separate."

Iamactuallyverybadass,fcl97za,t1_fcl826u,1577742552.0,"Ex-christian pk here. You'd be surprised. Most common thing I've seen here are just people trying to steal from coat racks, but if there's any child care you can be sure there will be some creepy people that have to be escorted out or carefully watched as well. They also are the ones that generally have first aid ready and other basic tasks like that. It's not actually strange for a church, usually just larger ones though, to have security. Also, I believe most church security is volunteer service and I've never been to a church where they carry guns."
AskReddit,fbb08sw,t1_fbazleg,1576690570.0,"The comment was making a joke because the ancient Greeks were known to have a lot of gay sex.

Also, why is it a bad thing to you for someone to say a country invented being gay? If they did, wouldn't that be a good thing? No one is hating on Greece here, but it does sound like you're hating those who are gay. If you really aren't saying that you should really rephrase everything you've said here"
