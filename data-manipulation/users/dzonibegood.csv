But still i wouldnt spend money on it i would rather just run stereo 2.0 as is. Its too much money for what it offers.
But the actual speakers be it floor standers or bookshelves... damn. They are way cheap for how they sound and how they look. I couldnt be happier how they sound.
I have 5.1 currently with 3020i for front and sides as well as 3090Ci for the center. I just have to reorganize room and earn money for the 3050i and im done for a long while... until the time comes for 7.1.4."

Some say good some say nah and in any case 200 pound more is favorable to the 3060. It really is not good sub at all. I demoed it and its not worth 400e compared to SVS PB1000 which is 500e here where i live.

Get SVS PB1000 sub which is the same price as this sub and it is a different league altogether. It can reach all the way to 20hz while Q sub can reach only to about 40hz.I will be also getting the floor standers 3050i for the fronts to get that beefy sound.  
PS: SVS subs match Q acoustics better then their own sub. It is also the same round shape as the speakers. :)"

hometheater,ffwjyor,t3_evk47a,1580303444.0,"No. It isn't bad to turn the subwoofer all the way up as the maker made it safe to play on the ""highest"". I mean of course you are wearing it down more then if you were to use it at 50% of the total volume because that is physics. THat doesn't mean its going to die very soon but it is going to die out sooner then if you use it at 50% of the volume.  
Now on another thing. What you may be hearing is that klipsch can go lower then your JBL sub and that is what you notice. You hare hearing lower sub frequencies at higher levels then what JBL can do and thus you need to increase JBL volume to raise lower sub frequencies at the level the klipsch sub can produce at lower volumes.  
What you need to do is get stronger subs. The subs like svs PB1000 or maybe PB2000. Basically you need the sub that can do down to 20hz in audible range. It's all rather complicated yet simple.  
But before all of this you really need to set your sub at audible range maybe at 50% of the volume and do the sub crawl. What you ALSO may be experiencing is the nulls. Your MLP might be at a NULL.  
Move your sub to the MLP position (yes literally place it on your sofa or chair or wherever you sit when you watch the movie) and move around the room (crawl) and mark the spots where the sub sounds the juiciest to you. WHere it sounds clear and vibrant. You don't want it to sound boomy so avoid those spots and once you find the best spot (which is feasible to be placed at ofc) place sub there and then test it out when you sit at your MLP."
movies,ffwj74g,t3_evlezg,1580302766.0,"The only thing i'm mad about FnF franchise is that they moved away from actual races and into actual action movies with michael bay type of explosions.  
The first 2 i loved because they are what FnF was all about. Illegal street races and they portrayed it properly. It actually is like that in illegal car meets. You always see lots of modified and mostly stupid modified cars. Drivers are ego maniacs.  
in one of the illegal car meets there was a drag race between two guys and they were very competitive actually so competitive they couldn't let other win and both of them stepped on it beyond what the street was capable and one of them went flying off into the street pole.   
I don't know how but driver survived without any bruises while sent flying through air into the pole at most likely 150-180 km/h. Car literally looked like a squished can of coke.

bravia,ffwgvrh,t3_evlch3,1580300573.0,"Dim the room. HDR content is not meant to be watched in the broad bright light because it is dark but also light at the same time and the reason behind this is that most of things are between 1 and 100 nit range with bright highlights raging above for dynamic of the picture.  
Unlike SDR, HDR brightness cannot be upped because as i said it is as bright as it is dark and thats the beauty of it.  
So lower those curtains when you play fifa or any movie and learn the god damn english to watch without subs.  
Subs are so strong because they are shinning always in maximum brightness and netflix app doesn't have control over subtitle brightness. You can modify this on a PC with a proper media player to change the sub color and intensity.

You don't have to retexture anything. You don't even have to invent something because it already is in the engine you just have to apply the code that engine already has for dynamic geometric deformity and a bit of thinking to make this work.  
You would have to create outfits for NPCs yes and as i see there actually aren't many outfits for NPCs anyway. They have 2 3 model variants and they just rotate them in different color.  


Please check ""days gone"" sony exclusive game and how they made snowfall cover the ground but since they had to work with ps4 pro which is not very capable they had to only do the part of it and just make textures change to the snow texture progressively.

hometheater,ff7sbl7,t3_es32li,1579657159.0,"Uhm i think lots of peeps told you already but ima do it as well to refresh my knowledge.  
Basically your placement is completely of. You need to understand one thing... Speakers push air and thus the air gets moved and moving air is moving the tiny little hairs inside our ear drum thus electrical sparks are generated and translated into frequency we register as a tone or a noise.  
Now every sound frequency has its own wave size (its how big the air moves just like when you drop a tiny rock or a boulder, each has its own wave size) and the higher the frequency is the smaller the sound wave size is.  
Long story short you ALWAYS want the FRONTS (Left Center Right) twitter (the tiny speaker) be in the same height as your Ears. You always want twitter to be at the height of your ear as twitter is responsible for all the tiny little specs of sound details like rain fallin down on leaves or water falling down from the pipe or the sibilance in the voice etc.  
Just raise the front left right and center to the ear level (the twitters) and aim the speakers AT YOU (a bit of toe in so it fires at you and not at the wall behind you) and you will have MASSIVE sound stage, imaging and response improvement. It will sound much clearer, dialogs be more intelligible, background noise have more detail etc."

I mean i would rather use speakers without the cover but man they aren't cheap to replace and it only takes one hit to get the day/week/month ruined I'd rather tune it in and compensate with the cover on."

hometheater,ff51uar,t1_ff51nm1,1579577946.0,Oh phew. I thought those were 5.1. Yeah then just by moving them farther back did the trick. :D
hometheater,ff51of1,t1_ff4fvpo,1579577825.0,"I'm thinking of doing this and it would actually look even cooler. About half a meter ""in"" and it would look like a tunnel persay and light should be eaten away by it while still enjoying the lightness of the rest of the room."
hometheater,ff51gz7,t3_ermlnd,1579577670.0,"The only thing i would change is the rear speakers. If this is 5.1 i would put them on the sides preferably 100 degrees of the chair in picture. They are too close to the risen chair set. They will go deaf extremely soon because they are not even one meter away from it so when you are watching the movie and if something loud hits which is suppose to hit say 90dB its gonna hit tem at about 96 dB or even more.   
They will be constantly in higher then normal proper dynamic range and they will not hear much of the front sound stage because of it.   


Just move it at least a meter away from the risen chair set at 100 degrees from the risen chair set and its right on spot for everyones enjoyment. You can but the calibrating microphone right between the lower and higher chair set and both chairs will get the near MLP sound stage dynamic range."
DaysGone,ff50xht,t3_ernhhc,1579577267.0,There will be days gone 2 and oh boy... That one is gonna explode and I can't wait for PS5 to be released so that i can replay days gone in proper native 4k 60 FPS with most likely increased shadow res as well as increased LOD. God it's gonna look beautiful.

Overwatch,ff3pr38,t3_eredvc,1579546211.0,"What i realized in overwatch is that you gotta talk. When i say talk you gotta give something to the team. Be it reading the kill cam or just informing the team ""genji is on the right about to flank"" or ""soldier behind us on balcony"" or just announce who from the enemy team is about or has the ultimate ready.90% of players will just default to death match style gameplay if there is no information on the focus over voice chat. I am currently practicing myself to be useful over voice chat and throw information for others.I currently try to read the kill feed for the team and impressively the team ACTUALLY gets confidence when i tell them we killed someone. They automatically start going into offense as a team without even communicating to eachother. Tanks start entering enemy territory and healers throwing out offensive spells at the enemy (be it heal debuff or moiras orb or mercy buffing DPS etc) and DPS actually bunch in and focus.I did about 30 matches since i started doing that and in all of them my team gained immense confidence and even if we fail that push i keep using the words ""GJ team, hard reset we got this!"" even if someone actually fucked up from my team, they actually reconsiliate their fuck up with twice as good push the next regroup. When we actually successfully wipe them out the first time everybody is SUPER COOPERATIVE and start throwing their best. Other players  actually start joining the chatter as well throwing all kind of useful information and we just keep on going! In those 30 matches i had about 3 of them where some smart ass was like ""Yeah dude can you shut up we don't need someone to inform us"". I just ignore what they said and keep on doing and the rest of the team  still keeps on listening to my feedback and pushes on!

All I have to say is DON'T tell someone that they're bad or they can't do the job. Even if you KNOW they are bad. in 95% of time they are really DOING THEIR BEST and trying their best. It may not be good but you still have to say something of the sort "" GJ keep going we got this! We'll get them next regroup I have ultimate we gon fuck em up!"" and give them confidence! They will improve instantly with just little confidence and that 1% of improvement is in most cases JUST ENOUGH to tip over to your advantage.When you tell someone that he is bad or point out he or she is missing shots or not properly healing or not getting positioned properly as tank will just DEMORALIZE the player and make them play EVEN WORSE and it also does an AOE to the REST of the players who start playing worse as well.

You have to remember that the players you get in the competitive are the players YOU ARE STUCK with to victory or death. So what you want is TO DO YOUR BEST and to give CONFIDENCE to your teammates so that they CAN DO THEIR BEST because they are also living breathing persons just like you. Maybe girlfriend dumped them. Maybe boss gave them a shitty day. Maybe something fucked up happened IRL and they came to overwatch to find sanctuary. If you make them feel something positive THEY WILL RETURN WITH POSITIVE RESULTS NO MATTER HOW SMALL IT IS!

Love you all and see you on the battlefield asswipes!"

AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ff2w0mp,t1_ff2vqx8,1579526294.0,I don't see skill points that enhance pets durability and strength. All i see is a perk that increases dmg by 100% and HP by 50% which is improvement but its garbage compared to other perks.
Amd,ff2vugs,t1_ff2v63b,1579526114.0,"Except that it is still 2 times as strong as your ""cutting low tech APU"" in both departments. It will never be really cutting edge until they manage to integrate full GPU with full ryzen CPU. Until then it will always be low tech for the mass and as i said it is really OK. It can run all past games like HD7970 could.
Actually it is still not the time to upgrade my PC because there is no worthy component currently on the market that can satisfy my upgrading needs. I need a tech that can run 4k 60 FPS ultra. Currently there is no tech on the market (even the 2080 ti) that can do that. I am waiting for the next gen ryzen and see what the BIG daddy navi will bring to the table. If the small navi can pull such performance doubling the die size should yield some very impressive results or maybe introduce infinity fabric to GPUs? By doing so the double die ""glued"" should be much cheaper for consumer and bring higher then 2080 ti power for 600$?"
DaysGone,ff2vcbv,t3_erckoq,1579525590.0,I just don't get it why don't they allow pics here in this redit? Where are those mods to edit? Can't we non mods do osmething about it report to mods or report mods for being AFK or smth?
PS4,ff2vauw,t3_erakws,1579525547.0,"What do you mean next gen games should look and play like? This is current gen. PS4 was next gen until it was released 7 years ago.   
I just don't get this phenomena where people call ps4 and xbox one next gen consoles when they are in fact current gen and ps5 xbox series x are the next gen titles.  


Btw there are other gems like HZD or days gone or spider-man or death stranding... Also incoming are last of us 2 and ghost of tsushima."
