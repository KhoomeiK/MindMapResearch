depression,fc4p0ca,t1_fc4osb3,1577423346.0,"I'm not considered unattractive, which is nice, but there are much prettier out there. However, I'm still blessed with mild ""looks"" so I should be happy. I don't know if I want sex. It seems so superficial but I guess that's what teenage boys want over anything else. So I'd rather not"
depression,fc4o4ko,t1_fc4nwt6,1577422531.0,"Confidence is key, trust me. You become enlightened and beautiful with it. I walk with my shoulders down, bad hair and smell like shit. I also dress with my fathers clothes and I'm a girl. Do you think guys even glance at me. They quirk with disgust. So walk with confidence, no matter what you believe in."
depression,fc4ndow,t1_fc4n0dg,1577421863.0,"You should be grateful and state the things you're thankful for everyday. Seems silly but it works since you seem to be a pretty cool dude with a nice personality overall, having wealth,friends... it's a mental illness and it shouldn't be normal for us to feel like shit constantly but hey do what you can with the efforts you want to put in otherwise just stay with your mindset now and go on your choice"
depression,fc4mj39,t1_fc4m5pz,1577421108.0,"I've always been really melancholic and sad. It's part of my personality. People practically know me as that depressed wonky person. ""Oh she's always been like that"", well, I could be different. I could be better. I know what makes me happy but I can't get it started when I struggle going to school. I struggle enjoying school. I don't relate to the people there because no one wants to have a deep convo with me."
depression,fc4lrxe,t1_fc4l2ez,1577420436.0,"Yeah, well there are a lot of factors that trigger a depression, I stated some of them. It seems superficial but those that don't have the things I mentioned can end up feeling like the ""unfairness"" is overwhelming and that it isn't worth it. And those that have it struggle with other things. I don't know that much about the world but I know a couple of things about people. 
It's almost impossible to be free from manipulation. You get influenced from all the corners of the world, it's inevitable. And how could you possibly fucking hide or run away. That won't solve anything. So you end up running from yourself. 
You gotta know what made you depressed in the first place and why. It's hard to tackle, and I can't get rid of that monster for shit. Turns out the beast I feared when I was little actually exists and it's ugly."
depression,fc4kf8j,t1_fc4jqid,1577419262.0,"Yeah, it sounds incredibly naive. I'm sorry if i offended you, it wasn't intended like that. I'm specifically pointing this towards the people that say they're depressed here on reddit. Who am I to decide what's right or wrong? I should have made that clear in the text. I want the people here to think twice and know that there are people who care. But you're right in that perspective. (I should think before I write things that can be harmful)."
Advice,fc4esoh,t1_fc4e8b6,1577414580.0,"I feel very sorry for my mother. I don't pity her,I simply don't understand how she could misinterpret everything and make me feel misunderstood. 

She is not a sociopath, nor is she a narcissist or any of that. She is just very unstable. My sister has a diagnose and its been really hard for her. She has controlled herself for as long as I remember so I don't think it's acceptable for me to trash her like this. By now, she has almost lost both her parents and going through many losses at many areas. 

On the other hand, she isn't being very self aware and only want us to improve. She's dealing with a lot. But this fight took me by surprise. I honestly don't know what to do with myself. She just won't listen."

depression,fc31dcj,t3_efv1hu,1577379226.0,"Mate. Stop for a second and think twice. I'm not keeping you from doing anything, just asking you to rethink this. Just... try to come in contact with your soul and remember how you were when you were just a newborn. So innocent and fragile, having a whole life in front of you. Talk to your younger child and ask him what he thinks and feels. Think twice."

Advice,fc1pd1j,t1_fbzs80e,1577325494.0,I don't have feelings for him but I like him as a friend...
Advice,fc1pc05,t1_fbzgvvi,1577325468.0,"She isn't anymore. I think he's making things complicated because we could be great friends,like we were before, and I think it's an unwritten rule that you shouldn't date your friends siblings... I'm also not interested in him."
Advice,fc1p54s,t1_fbzixsi,1577325294.0,"Yeah I feel like that too. He loves driving tho, but I don't want to lead him on, it feels wrong. I really love his company, I find him to be an incredibly amazing friend. So it's quite hard. But I'll try to do what's ""fair""."
Advice,fc1ozrn,t1_fc0a7n9,1577325161.0,"I don't think he'll confess it, but I should let him know that I don't see him that way, just in case."

Noses,fbt7t1m,t1_fbt6y12,1577070647.0,"I really appreciated your response. Yes, I've scrolled through this thread and seen so many beautiful women! What I noticed is that it's the nose specifically that gives them character and makes their beauty exotic/unique.

 I wouldn't consider myself ugly because of my nose, but it's just... big. It's wide and has a little hook. It's both long and wide, and I only look
OK/good when the lightning isn't to strong IMO. I have a friend who whines over her nose but my nose is bigger which makes me incredibly self conscious. 

I'm scared of getting a nose-job. You spend lots of money on that nose and everything can go wrong. I have to look beyond it. Yes, it practically makes my face, adding character to it. But I'm a teenager and I've got to enjoy my youth! I have to stop whining about a look and start focusing on the hooks of life! It's not easy, but it's worth a try."
