It's still fairly unlikely that a full scale war does start, and hopefully it doesn't. But if it does, as a non-American, I'm personally very conflicted, since on one hand it's about time for someone to show the US that they can't just unilaterally stir up shit around the world by doing stuff like assassinating high ranking officials of nation states they aren't at war with, and on the other hand, a lot of people on both sides who had no part in starting the conflict are going to die regardless of who wins. Again.

There's really no good outcome in this. 

1) If the US wins, they'll grow bolder and more bullyish under Trump's rule, and there'll be yet one more extended conflict in the ME, since the possible collapse of Iran won't be pretty. It's also fairly possible that all of those ""Hillary will lead us into a yet another war!""-Trump voters will just completely ignore what he did, and rally behind their ""strong"" president, boosting his support, and ensuring more shitty times both in the US and outside.  

2) If Iran wins, which is probably a long shot, they too will grow bolder, gain a lot of regional authority, and consider that a carte blanche to develop their nuclear weapon. I doubt they'll be using it offensively, but regionally they'll become an another Russia, in that any opposition to them will have to be done with kid gloves. We could always hope that the boost in national self-confidence somehow would lead to social liberalization, but that's fairly unlikely too.

The Panama papers are actually a good example of how disinformation is spreading on the Internet. I'll quote an old comment of mine on the papers:

>[Here's](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/20161201-global-impact/) ICIJ, the organization that published the papers, describing their effects:

>*Since the Panama Papers broke in early April, hundreds of journalists from dozens of countries who collaborated on the investigation have published more than 4,700 news stories based on Mossack Fonseca, the globe-spanning law firm that has created hard-to-trace shell companies for corporations, politicians and fraudsters.*

>...

>*As a result, at least 150 inquiries, audits or investigations have been announced by police, customs, financial crime and mafia prosecutors, judges and courts, tax authorities, parliaments and corporate reviews in 79 countries around the world, according to global media reports and official statements. Thousands of taxpayers and companies are under investigation. Legislatures from Ireland to Mongolia to Panama have rushed through laws to strengthen weaknesses pinpointed by the media partnership’s reporting. Governments have already reported recouping tens of millions of dollars in taxes on previously undeclared funds.*

>*Across four continents, police have raided warehouses, offices and homes. Government officials in three countries have resigned, including a prime minister and an energy and industry minister. Business executives and attorneys are behind bars awaiting criminal trials in the Middle East, Europe and Latin America.*

>...

>That piece was written in 2016, and doesn't include anywhere near all of the effects of the leak. One of the bigger things to happen since that has been the Pakistani prime minister getting removed from office in 2017.

Despite the huge effects of the investigations to the papers in dozens of countries, people losing their government positions or jobs, getting jailed, or people like Lionel Messi having to pay massive fines for tax fraud, the consensus on the Internet is still that the papers were suppressed on the mainstream press, and that the leaks had no effect.
