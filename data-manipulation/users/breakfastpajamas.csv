BokuNoHeroAcademia,fdvrjnl,t3_en4r2x,1578750709.0,"Night Eye's quirk was incorrect most of the time. He failed to predict an accurate future on two occasions: the first was when he was battling Chisaki, managed to predict his moves  and dodge them for a time until abruptly getting hit by one of Chisaki's spikes, almost dying.

The 2nd time is when he predicted Midoriya's death. Deku clearly came out ontop.
So how can he say the future is immutable if it was changed not once but twice?"

Also do any of the people our age getting married consider the children? It's all fun an games to get married but I'll tell you what's not fun for kids; divorce. It's the fucking worst and it could probably be avoided if people didn't get married when their mind frames aren't yet properly matured"

AskReddit,fctsmgw,t1_fcts1ea,1577957381.0,"So firstly I would just like to point out I'm on mobile so apologies in advance.

Say for instance you are the son/daughter of a small family of four and in your early twenties. One day you put a series of events together and caught on that everything in your life is conditioned, nothing is what it seems. It's all a test. Your family's friends are actually scientists and every event that has happened in your life and theirs was created and deliberately put there. None of your family members are aware besides you. Your lives are dictated without you even knowing and the scientists went out of their way to condition your family that it feels as though the life you lead is real and genuine when it's actually all a big test or simulation if you will.

The scientists motivation for doing this to your family is unknown but only you know and you don't have tangible proof."
