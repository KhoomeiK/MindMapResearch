todayilearned,fen5c7r,t3_epye6b,1579277314.0,"Here's the weird part: The points he made in his manifesto, *Industrial Society and Its Future*, are correct.

He writes that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life less fulfilling, and has caused widespread psychological suffering. He argues that most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits because of technological advances; He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems, rather than vice versa.

He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike people who understand technology's negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable. He calls for a return to ""nature.""

Kaczynski argues that the erosion of human freedom is a natural product of an industrial society because ""the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function"". 

However, he states that the system has not yet fully achieved ""control over human behavior"" and ""is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival"".

He states that the task of those who oppose industrial society is to propagate ""an ideology that opposes technology"", one that offers the ""counter-ideal"" of nature."

unpopularopinion,fekf84p,t1_fejr7n9,1579198795.0,"Obviously you're confused and triggered by the phrase ""children in cages."" An Associated Press (AP; ""where news 'sources' get their news"") reporter visited a detention facility where foreign nationals were being held after being caught illegally crossing US borders. She described ""children in cages.""

Afterward, AP published a  RETRACTION, explaining that detainees, including minors, were detained behind chain-link fences, which are customarily used in most all detainee facilities the world over, as well as around other structures and properties everywhere.

Chain-link fences had been commonly used before that one reporter's use of the phrase ""children in cages"" but that inflammatory wording spread as the weaponized words of choice by politically-motivated critics of U.S. border control.

Since you seem especially triggered by those words I suggest you google and confirm for yourself that what I'm saying is true. I think you'll then feel better."

I just try to pay attention to the candidates when I can, watch the debates and catch  news stories, and we all have the ability to glean a sense of a person, and he's not made a good impression from the start.

He started off claiming the most ""executive"" experience (based on being the mayor of a small college town in Indiana) and he greatly exaggerated his role at the one real job he had after school and has been backtracking since. 

In the first few debates he tried to paint himself among the divisive identity-politics candidates, but when he failed to gain significant minority group votes, he changed into more of a 'moderate' as a new approach.

There's more, but in essence, he's a phony. He has no business being among serious contenders. Nothing in his background or his present merits him being president of the United States of America.
