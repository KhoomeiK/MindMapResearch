phoebebridgers,ffjxrrj,t1_ffjxegz,1580009876.0,That makes perfect sense to me. Hayley Williams has her solo album(to name another artist I like) around then.
Paramore,ffjxaqa,t3_etw3ws,1580009499.0,That explains why she is naked in it.
AnnieClark,ffjx9rv,t3_eu0sec,1580009479.0,She looks like she wants to make a country album.
wynonnaearp,ffjx8vu,t3_etlvca,1580009459.0,Lol at the timing.
LucyDacus,ffjx075,t1_ff8zof2,1580009267.0,Me too. She's written about her adopted mother on other songs too.
Purityring,ffjwtrs,t1_ffjwmvc,1580009125.0,Love it.
Paramore,ffjwbon,t3_es3vez,1580008721.0,LB is cool and has worked with many of other favs.
phoebebridgers,ffjw7ri,t1_ffju52m,1580008636.0,"Agreed!!!! Julibean said her album is done(surprisingly) recently. As for Lucy, I'm not clear and we sort of got a 2019 release."

This is the evidence that Stacy is her wife."
AnnieClark,ffjbjh9,t1_ffjay1t,1579994841.0,Yeah. She's not straight and could easily do this job.
fakehistoryporn,fffal20,t3_esuyfk,1579879722.0,Dr Oz's new tonic that cures skin cancer.
buffy,fffaj75,t1_fff14gf,1579879689.0,Early 00's by extension as well. Keith Mars wouldn't exist on a Joss Show.
buffy,fffac7j,t1_fff1fj6,1579879565.0,That is quite true as well.
bigthief,fffa8y5,t3_et499i,1579879505.0,"They were recorded and released very close together, so that makes sense."
AlternateHistory,fff9q4k,t1_ffcf9nu,1579879168.0,"Probably. I think Richards would likely lose, but to a different Republican."
chvrches,fff9iq1,t3_et8gsd,1579879032.0,"Lol. As for the Canadian part, they do know Tegan and Sara well(they covered them once). Chvrches also  seem to be compared to Purity Ring a lot as well."
chvrches,fff9dif,t3_esxf3q,1579878939.0,This is cute.
phoebebridgers,fff9cqs,t3_eszokl,1579878924.0,agreed
phoebebridgers,fff9cmg,t1_ffe2jff,1579878922.0,What about Amanda Shires?

veronicamars,ffbr4tk,t1_ffb2wcs,1579779439.0,typo?
wynonnaearp,ffbr3s7,t3_esf9n3,1579779401.0,Nice
StarWars,ff8rk4c,t3_es8s02,1579693242.0,Worry to lose is to lead to evil augury.
teganandsara,ff8rgbx,t1_ff4olbo,1579693107.0,Agreed. I always liked them on IIWY(which shows them with very different haircuts than most fans are used to)
AlternateHistory,ff8r3ev,t1_ff843yu,1579692651.0,"He had cancer, so there's that."
brandicarlile,ff8r2co,t1_ff8n31t,1579692613.0,That guy sounds awful indeed. The Joke is a great song of course.
pvris,ff8qrzm,t1_ff83pmk,1579692232.0,I only thought of it because they were opening for Halsey.
pvris,ff8qrhk,t1_ff8b0ef,1579692213.0,True
AlternateHistory,ff5qaxx,t1_ff40yl9,1579605866.0,"Remember his heart was in bad health too, so I imagine he'd likely have died at some point from his health issues. I personally can't imagine him living past what in our universe was Bush I's Presidency."
doctorwho,ff5punu,t3_erkhkh,1579605257.0,agreed
firefly,ff5pub4,t3_erroza,1579605243.0,Mandaorian is an obvious example.
doctorwho,ff5psin,t1_ff411bs,1579605175.0,Seems like a great fit and the right age.
AlternateHistory,ff5pr1n,t1_fei75g5,1579605119.0,Does it help Hillary Clinton win in the U.S.?
AlternateHistory,ff5pq4t,t1_ff5il8t,1579605084.0,"True. China wants to do it. I imagine a more stable Russia might try again too(imagine them after Putin with a more ""boring"", if not necessarily kinder, leader)."
todayilearned,ff5pbym,t1_ff2zkvp,1579604522.0,Yeah. We've seen them with grasses they ate still in their mouth. We've seen crushed calves as well.
teganandsara,ff5pap7,t1_ff30bkk,1579604472.0,"The story of how So Jealous was made was definitely interesting. It did have a soundshift from IIWY(the writing wasn't that different, but the vocals and the instrumentals were very different) on top of all that."
teganandsara,ff5p9b3,t1_ff4oqg9,1579604416.0,Yeah. Love the new one a lot tbh.
teganandsara,ff5p7fa,t1_ff4zq4x,1579604340.0,"I feel I've liked this album a lot more as time has passed. I still like So Jealous, but Sainthood has held up better over time."
teganandsara,ff5p5w5,t3_erf8gt,1579604279.0,"My favorite and in my opinion, their best after The Con(maybe even better than The Con in some small areas)."
teganandsara,ff5p500,t1_ff4apwf,1579604245.0,yes
2000sAlternative,ff2quc0,t3_epqr8c,1579519924.0,I love this song. One of my favorite albums from high school.
althistory,ff2qnwg,t1_ff2q49z,1579519667.0,"Interesting points. I'm an American, but I do recall an attempt in the 90's to make that country a Republic(for unrelated reasons) with a different constitution that failed, so the idea of Australia with a different constitution doesn't sound too crazy."

# “All I am surrounded by is fear and dead men.”"
althistory,ff2pwbd,t1_ff2cqkk,1579518526.0,"Yeah, good points. Would the Aboriginal Civil Rights movement have come earlier in TTL?"
todayilearned,ff1xmjm,t1_ff0c406,1579488506.0,"We do know what Wooly Mammoths probably looked like, but they were recent and live elephants exist."
Paramore,ff1xhg4,t1_ff1brbf,1579488414.0,I love the original Tegan Quin version too.
JulienBaker,fev04aw,t1_feu7s9w,1579391659.0,Nice!!! :) Thanks. I'm excited for this.
JulienBaker,fev03eq,t1_feuef1j,1579391649.0,She took some time off. I know this.
AnnieClark,feuzzi5,t1_feuotep,1579391605.0,Yeah. That sounds about right. I imagine it'd be released on the tail end of 2020/ VERY early 2021.
fakehistoryporn,feryqsc,t3_eqfmns,1579359722.0,Where's R Kelly in this?
JulienBaker,feryn5q,t3_eqcp1u,1579359684.0,Yay!!!! I'm surprised that she finished it despite personal issues.
JulienBaker,feryn0k,t1_fepsff0,1579359682.0,Yeah. I think it might be the latter for obvious reasons. She is performing again at least though and I hope this is a new album of hers(and she is implying she finished her own work).
ANGEL,ferxy11,t1_fenk26v,1579359452.0,Angel/Spike would not be something that predators or aliens could get to.
althistory,ferxtoj,t1_fepjuun,1579359402.0,"Yeah. It'd probably be a bit more Brazil(different language, but a lot of oil too), where it is nominally democratic, but has a right wing demagogue."

Democrats2020,femkzb7,t1_feklu5l,1579260762.0,Yeah. He's got Michigan already locked up and with the right running mate could easily win Arizona.
buffy,femkwak,t3_eprhdt,1579260656.0,Season 5 has a better arc(obviously Angel is a different show with its own feel).
startrek,femkr54,t3_ept9x9,1579260470.0,True
AlternateHistory,femkdg5,t3_epbctj,1579259964.0,"There was no chance. WWI having a realistic German victory, ooth, had a more realistic chance(even with unfavorable odds)."
phoebebridgers,femkbwx,t1_feilx3e,1579259908.0,"Coincidentally Fiona Apple has an album too this year.  The PP thing was a good song, but a sad one as it was full of tragedy in the headlines(and for a noble cause)."
riotgrrrl,femkahr,t1_femifwp,1579259855.0,Indeed. they sing in both English and Portuguese.
orphanblack,femk93d,t3_epqplg,1579259802.0,Alia is more Ilana Glaser

CourtneyBarnett,fehc79i,t1_fegj88j,1579113557.0,Agreed. Sleater Kinney almost made an album with him producing(He was their #2 pick after Annie). Jeff's also worked with Feist.
AlternateHistory,fegch1b,t1_feearl7,1579087585.0,That works too a bit like HW in OTL in 1988.
fakehistoryporn,fegcg8z,t3_eox3io,1579087558.0,Worshiping the Kims as gods is one of  few things not banned there.

todayilearned,fed7ynh,t3_eog0jf,1579003028.0,Korea is similar as this article notes.

wynonnaearp,fed7d5u,t3_eoi9nn,1579002315.0,Nice!!!
Muna,fed74tl,t3_eog4d4,1579002037.0,Nice story. That is a good song and I like how it puts Katie's adult life(so far) in a nutshell. I feel this band reminds me a bit of Tegan and Sara(ever hear their cover of Relief Next to me?) in their prime musically speaking had they been a dozen years younger.
teganandsara,fed6zry,t3_eojusa,1579001860.0,I wish they put this(or the SJ B sides  or even the original recordings of HIJLY songs) on spotify.
AnnieClark,fe7eweq,t1_fe6blzb,1578913663.0,"SVE is one of my favorite artists, I'd love that."
riotgrrrl,fe7euih,t1_fe6lz6o,1578913637.0,True. The singer''s married to Kat from the L word.
AnnieClark,fe64skp,t1_fe5lxnn,1578881785.0,Lol. That has a 100% chance of happening.
riotgrrrl,fe64r1c,t3_entba7,1578881758.0,Is CSS an option?
AnnieClark,fe4ovhv,t3_emrk21,1578861495.0,I'd probably rearrange Strange Mercy to have the second half be stronger.
VoteBlue,fe4opqt,t1_fe4ob1i,1578861446.0,It was still a big deal as they were all GOP seats before.
StarWars,fe4ky3o,t3_enoga8,1578860422.0,The effects were actually quite good for their day.
CourtneyBarnett,fe4kns1,t3_emqs46,1578860319.0,Love this.
