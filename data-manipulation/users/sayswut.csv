sydney,ff1hqem,t1_fewq3hc,1579479415.0,"I see my psychiatrist (pdoc) once every 3 months or so, maybe an extra session here or there if I'm having symptoms and need meds adjusted.

With a psychologist (psych), I've found it helps to go in with a particular goal, and to see them frequently enough to maintain momentum towards that goal. So if you have ten sessions with an MHCP, and you know you have some trauma history that is currently active, you might tell the psych you want to get that under control. 

For example: last year I was moving overseas for study. I have some diagnosed PTSD relating to leaving home as a queer kid, and I knew from experience that packing up my apartment was going to cause problems. I saw a student psychiatrist at the ACAP clinic (free for students) with that goal. We worked through CBT and exposure therapy. Weekly sessions, which is actually quite a lot, given I was coming out of each session feeling wrung out. I think I did somewhere between 12 and 16 sessions. At the end of it, I no longer have those trauma triggers around packing."

For the psychiatrist, I recommend Mindcare in Ultimo, but they're not bulk billing. You pay around 350 for the first session (1 hour) (IIRC), 240 for a short session after that, get about $100.

I strongly recommend going to a psychiatrist for a couple of sessions for an assessment — counselling goes a LOT easier if you medicate anything diagnosable."

BetterEveryLoop,fepu0lw,t1_feplf2f,1579331252.0,"Ok, we can see it at the quantum level where shit is *really fucking small* and you can isolate, with experimental apparatus, a single sub-atomic particle. And you can see that, when it interacts with an observation mechanism, *the observation permanently changes the state of the particle,* even though it existed as a cloud of potential states before that. At the macroscopic level, encounters with other particles perform the same function as observation in our experiment. A cloud of potential bumps into a determined particle and BAM, it's determined too.

sydney,fepike9,t3_epyz4b,1579321412.0,"This is so fucking hard, I'm sorry OP. Try to think about it from your dentist's perspective. Their prescription writing practices are analysed by Medicare to identify over-prescription of opioids — but they work in a field where pretty much every procedure is due to pain or causes pain. If someone presents with no obvious cause of pain and all sweaty and distressed, unfortunately, that's how someone doctor shopping because of dependence also presents. 

You actually have to seem LESS in pain to be taken seriously. Doctor/dentist, the pain had its onset a week ago. I've used panadol and ibuprofen at 800mg/day without relief. The pain is sharp and stabbing, localised to the right/left, around the second molar. It wakes me up at night. The lack of sleep is exacerbating xyz other condition. By seeming informed and measured you're less likely to be written off as drug-seeking. And yes *I know* it is unfair that you're being written off in that way, but remember from the doctor or dentist's perspective they have no way of measuring or seeing your pain — the only way they can assess validity is by finding something wrong with you or making a judgment based on how you present."

Erskineville is longer and the Erko shortening probably saves time and complexity. The s-k junction is pretty slow, as it involves a palatovelar stop, and the tongue moving from the frontal s, back to the soft palate for k, then back front for the 'een' syllable.
