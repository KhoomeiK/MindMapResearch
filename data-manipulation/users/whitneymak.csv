People will wring their hands, vote party lines, and it just continues. The trial in the Senate is a joke due to the Republicans' desire to keep witness testimony locked away AND insisting they'll work with WH counsel. 

Why does anyone even give a fuck anymore? We've lost."

aww,fetj7m6,t1_fete0ov,1579376005.0,"I wish someone would have made this clear to me before I got my ferret in college. Fucking high maintenance little buggers. However, it was EXCELLENT for me because being an attractive, alcoholic, single, bartending 20 year old female in South Florida living alone/with roommates, I needed someone to be accountable to. I tried getting her a friend a number of times. She was a natural loner like me (I'm a performer when I'm out of the house), we were on the same weird wavelength. I had to come home from benders to check on her. I had to clean her and sanitize her cage and play and snuggle. 

I had to let her thrive still. She was my tether to reality. For 7 years. 

So, in turn, we kept one another alive.

Miss you, Nibs. (11/8/13)

4.5 years sober. 😎

But yeah, sorry for the memoir.
