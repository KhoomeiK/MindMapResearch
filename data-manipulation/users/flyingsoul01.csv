therapy,ffsywim,t3_euqt8x,1580198370.0,"For me the individual, ask questions like a detective to help me problem solve any random situation affecting me. And open up new, different suggestions. I hate sessions where I'm stuck with no new insights and nothing new to add. If constant sessions feels stagnant, I just give up on it and myself because I feel like a lost cause and I don't see any benefit anymore. Maybe I need a happy pill. Give me your brain."
depression,ffq10h5,t1_ffq08xn,1580114502.0,Happened to me when I did not read the rule on how to post correctly in a particular sub.

depression,femcv71,t3_cml6ni,1579249049.0,"I don't know why I am spending my time on this site anymore when I'm getting really tired of it. What the hell is the point of reading all this going to do? I feel the same everyday, no meaning, no purpose. Fk, I'm trying to spend more time offline, so I can start doing things. But its hard because I don't see the use of doing things. Wtf one's got to do to remove these thoughts and start moving like a robot who doesn't give a fuck but only to complete his mission. Atleast then, I'll be able to step out of my bubble without thinking. Like fuck my emetions."
BPD,fehdw6j,t1_feginjj,1579114535.0,I'm not sure. I think I felt like I need to be responsible with the situation instead of feeling the bystander effect. The bad reason for me is having the thoughts about the old lady as an object of nuisance instead of seeing her as a human being that needs to be helped.
BPD,feg9mz1,t1_feg902b,1579083725.0,"I guess now that I really think about it for this particular situation, it ""should"" be both. Thanks. I don't know, sometimes I can't help joining the dark side. I'll just stay neutral in my thoughts."
BPD,feg8q4p,t1_feg8if8,1579082426.0,"If I thought of the old lady as a troublesome obstacle, this means it's similar to a big rock in the middle of the road that needs to be move."

BPD,feg3ffe,t3_eosgs1,1579075192.0,"Video games on steam. Action figures on ebay. Random products on amazon. I regret having games I'm not even playing. I regret having these action figures with no more reason, and left in storage. I regret having some products I'm not using, and some expired. Now because I don't eat much or lazy to make my food, I'm thinking about starting a fast food spree for a few days."
depression,fdptx5z,t3_cml6ni,1578640329.0,Idk. Tired to even try. So I'm Just going to leave my presence here.
therapy,fdp9zsx,t1_fdmo7uh,1578623467.0,"I don't know much and it could be false with simplicity. I'm just giving out my random thoughts without much study. But with experience and observation from 15 session. A first time therapy that ended prematurally. I don't know what therapy method was used but we tried some role play, some kind of mindfullness relaxation activity. I vented, talking about myself while therapy was going nowhere. I brought up that taking some action does not help with the way I see life/ my perspective. Therapy ended prematurally before I could experiment more with the interaction, where I become ballsy with my questions potentially involving about her boundaries, philosophy, her mental process, etc, for my own curiosity. I found her pretty from the start so Idk if I had transference. Maybe I did by seeing her as my dream girl instead of someone neutral. Maybe the topics that I would brought up would lead to attachment issues. It's a lengthy process for one's enlightenment and changing thought process.

Anyway, I'm impress with your achievements in your life. In a way that is a homework you did. A homework where you help yourself by taking action or getting new positives insights that will help you advance in your own life. Maybe therapy even helped you change the way you see things, your perspective. 
Therapy is an activity of communication and trust between therapist and client. Maybe that is part of the collaboration. In the end, no therapist can change you but yourself, but what they can do is help you and support you with the things you are facing. In a way, I guess you are collaborating with yourself while being in an alliance with the therapist. Even with this, what feels like a forming relationship, you and the therapist can't be in each others life like a close friend or couple because it's still a business with rules that may not be satisfactory.

But I will say, you didn't collaborate with your therapist this time. Because it seems that instead of talking about these stuff with your therapist, you came to talk it out in here, or keep some in your head. So trust may be involve, maybe for fear of being dissapointed of a response. But in other situations, the therapist can also be at fault. Like by not providing progress to the client. But we are all still humans with our own problems and pov on how to procede with things. Anyway thats some of my random perspective that may or not be right."
therapy,fdmlxd7,t3_em55ev,1578554953.0,"I'm not sure but I think it's when a therapist gives a homework as one of the solution to your problems after listening to your troubled stories, and you completing it consistently.

 If you do your homework by involving yourself to the task, maybe even consistently, a collaboration has been formed. But if you didn't, the collaboration failed. Some therapist give some homeworks that doesnt fit with your troubled thoughts, like they didn't understand the consequences and your feelings base on your stories. Therefore, you may decide to not involve yourself with the task. So the collaboration will automatically fail because there is a lack of mutual approval with the solution.

 It all comes down to if you did the therapist's  homework consistently or not. Or even being able to communicate the help you think you need with."
therapy,fd0s0fb,t3_ejs39p,1578122967.0,"I don't know. You now have to gamble with your trust. Either you use your trust card, or keep it. Either you trust the stranger, or not. It's a gamble in which odds can increase with communication, action and observation."
therapy,fcpz64k,t3_eifc47,1577875295.0,"I think a therapist goal is to help you find ways to deal with problems( relationship, confidence, communication, etc). That's where they say it will take some ""work"". Instead of just finding an explanation to a problem (depression). They will not try to say things that is wrong with you. Like if they say that you are lazy, incompetent, weak minded, that will very much hurt and is unnessary. But, do tell the therapist your intentions in therapy and for the session, and ask how they can help you with that. They will give you their answer. Remember, it cost money if you are paying, and they cannot be a replacement for something( friend, mother, idol, etc)."
BPD,fcpt40o,t3_eig35u,1577871551.0,"Yeah, I always want to talk with someone, but when it comes to it, I might get bored easily. So I get confuse on what to say next. But I still don't mind if someone randomly talks with me, even though I think I might be awkward sometimes. 

Oh! I messed up my sleeping schedule, it's almost 5 am..."
depression,fckdpoe,t3_ehn5r6,1577723020.0,"Thanks for the info. I don't mind trying those out if I find them today, that's if I even get out."
