It’s like a dense cake type base with blueberries/strawberries/apples on top and this really crumbly sugar stuff sprinkled on top of that.  They served it with coffee. It was one of the tastiest things I’ve ever eaten. 

Hope you’re having a good day OP!:)

Edit: spelling of Kugen might be Kuchen?"
