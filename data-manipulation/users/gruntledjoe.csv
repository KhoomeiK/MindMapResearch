MotorcyclePorn,fdij7cx,t1_fdiiye0,1578444118.0,"It’s a solid beginner bike. It wasn’t too fast, it had a white bulb flash at 10.5k rpm (redline was 12k), and it pretty much big and slow. It was good for commuting and going through the city in rush hour compared to my 600rr. I enjoyed it, and if I could I’d buy it back for ole times sake."
MotorcyclePorn,fdii2z0,t1_fdick25,1578443404.0,"Unless you’re going to drag race, it’s dumb af to stretch a bike. You’re taking away its handling, and these types of bikes are all about handling.

bikesgonewild,fddlxg9,t1_fddeivy,1578317238.0,"I’m a student as well lol so I get the cheap part. It ducks because I need to get a new chain and sprocket as well as some racing mirrors. I guy I ride with whose ridden for close to 40 years told me “you can’t go wrong with Michelin’s” he said the 2ct’s are reliable and they’re aren’t too expensive. ( I got them at a dealership). I know everyone has an opinion, I wouldn’t recommend Dunlap’s or continentals personally. I’d rather spend a few more dollars on something that important. 

Also wear gear man if you have it. I’m not trying to preach to you man, but I had a grade 1 ac joint sprain due to a low side and it sucked."
bikesgonewild,fdcxtee,t1_fdcfaei,1578287492.0,I’ll have to try them. I’d be fine with 5k miles and being extremely sticky rather than longevity. I’m not worried about that since I won’t get out unless it’s at least 48 degrees
