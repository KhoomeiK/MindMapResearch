You idea of ""extremists"" contaminating the Democratic party (which is not the direct cause of money and PR-motivated pandering by movie studios, money and cynical PR is) still doesn't make your generalization of everything ""left"" logical. Parties do not define ideologies. Simply being some kind of left-wing does not mean that the Democrat platform is your view.

Similarly, simply being left-wing doesn't mean you're responsible for all of the left. By this logic every voter is to blame for things that aren't their position and likely had little affect on. Philosophical culpability aside, this simply isn't how things work. Minorities don't need some related, incidentally supportive majority to get things done and have an impact on society.

By ""contamination"" logic, your own position in terms of action must not be independent centrism, but avoiding concrete political activity all together. Because of the ""contamination"", to take concrete political action, including *voting*, is to be responsible for the views and actions of a large swathe of society.

By calling left and right ""cancer"", which is absurdly antagonistic but that's besides the point, you're condemning people just like yourself for simply voting.

AfterTheLoop,fd1na8y,t1_fd120tr,1578133738.0,"Not being a card-carrying Democrat or Republican doesn't mean you aren't left or right wing. You idea of ""extremists"" contaminating the Democratic party (which is not the direct cause of money and PR-motivated pandering by movie studios, money and cynical PR is) still doesn't make your generalization of everything ""left"" logical. Parties do not define ideologies. Simply being some kind of left-wing does not mean that the Democrat platform is your view.

Similarly, simply being left-wing doesn't mean you're responsible for all of the left. By this logic every voter is to blame for things that aren't their position and likely had little affect on. Philosophical culpability aside, this simply isn't how things work. Minorities don't need some related, incidentally supportive majority to get things done and have an impact on society. [Smaller groups can actually better at achieving their goals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_theory#Group_size)

By ""contamination"" logic, your own position in terms of action must not be independent centrism, but avoiding concrete political activity all together. Because of the ""contamination"", to take concrete political action, including *voting*, is to be responsible for the views and actions of a large swathe of society.

By calling left and right ""cancer"", which is absurdly antagonistic but that's besides the point, you're condemning people just like yourself for simply voting. The vast majority of voters don't have their beliefs 100% replicated in the actions of the party they voted for, but not voting achieves nothing at all.
