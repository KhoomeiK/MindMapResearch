KingOfTheHill,ffpfj91,t1_ffch2zb,1580093787.0,"I doubt it. Look at what happened to the show Last Man Standing. It wasn’t offensive but it got canceled, according to Tim Allen, because the show leans politically right. It later got picked up by a different network but the point is it got canceled even though it was a very popular show.

I’m comparing it because it’s got a similar dynamic to All in the Family (brash conservative father with a really leftist son-in-law).

Edit: LOL at the downvotes for simply stating an opinion. Kind of proves my point, actually."

His parents weren’t home at the time (he was about 14) so they brought him to my house because he told them my mom could take responsibility for him.
