starterpacks,feulswq,t3_eqjtg1,1579387742.0,"LOL i'm 10 years older than the nearest brother, but 2 of them (Dickweed and Halfass) were about 2 years apart.

They fought like animals constantly. Had a scissor fight once. One time Dickweed had a hole in his foot so big you could fucking see light through it, and Halfass made him walk home on a gravel road like that. Eventually dickweed would fuck halfass's wife (and no i am not kidding); when Halfass confronted his wife she claimed his kid could be dickweed's. Halfass goes to confront the fucker, and i shit you not, the dude flat stop says ""I don't care"" to the whole thing. It all worked out in the end but it was a tense few weeks waiting for the DNA test.

Needless to say they are estranged now and literally wont' even speak to each other or be in the same place at the same time. It's rough. 

Anyway, siblings."

Probably my favorite of his novels is The Great and Secret Show, which has elements of horror and fantasy in it.

edit: I should note ""fantasy"" in this context is more ""fantastical"" and less ""lord of the rings"" or what have you."
