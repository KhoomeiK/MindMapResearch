TEFL,ffjc2qa,t3_etvz6n,1579995157.0,"Adults.  100% adults.  I specifically chose to do an MA TESOL focusing on Adults because teaching kids going to be 1/3 teaching, 1/3 baby sitting, 1/3 OMG I want to  kill you all.  The thing is, it doesn't have to be this way.  If the school sets up the curriculum right, and has interesting materials, play time for the kids to burn off energy, and well behaved kids, it *can* be great, and the school really allowing discipline, it really is a real teaching job.

 But often times the curriculum sucks, you can't change it, and the kids are spoiled, so its more like baby sitting and hoping they pay attention 10% of the time, and you just being stressed because the kids are bored and ignoring you, hitting each other, and disrespectful.  And on top of it, the topics are boring for the teacher as well.  

Teaching adults is AMAZING.  They know what they want.  They are responsible for themselves.  They can think about things more interesting than their favorite color or animal.  When I teach adults, we can actually TALK about things.  Abortion, space exploration, climate change, drinking, divorce, the benefits of traditional education vs. other types.  And if you get older adults, many of them have great life stories to tell you.  Some of my students have even become my friends outside of work, because they are just super interesting to be around.  And the teaching methods are just way more explicit.  You tell them what to do and why, and they get it, the end.

I teach adults for 16 weeks, then teach kids for a month for camp, and then get a vacation, and then repeat it.  The month of teaching kids is 5x more stressful than the whole 4 months of teaching adults combined.

The only problem is most of your job opportunities will be for teaching kids.  But if this looks like a viable long term option for you then 100% teach adults."

exchristian,ffhzdfh,t3_etpavn,1579960211.0,"I went to college and learned how to research stuff. The burden of proof lies on the person making the claim, not on the person questioning the claim. If someone makes a claim without verifiable evidence, you can dismiss that claim without having to do anything. Christianity doesn't meet any minimum standards of evidence, so it should be thrown out. On the other hand some people say they feel like it's correct, or it just makes sense. But if we're being honest with ourselves, the only reason people feel like that is because they've been constantly raised to believe it. That doesn't actually make it any more true then any other religion that people are brought up in, like Hinduism, Buddhism, Norse mythology or anything else. And since those'll get thrown out by Christians as being obviously false, since Christianity has the same lack of evidence for it, then it should get thrown out as well regardless of what we feel about it.

I didn't become an atheist instantly though, it was more like a slow half a decade long process. I admitted early on that it was possible that Christianity wasn't true, but I still believed it. But just as time went on I became more and more aware of the fact that I was believing something simply because I had been told to and everyone around me believed it too. Eventually I just had to admit to myself that I had stopped believing, and it didn't really feel good or bad it just kind of happened."

They just ""feel"" like he is doing well, compared to how they felt Obama was horrid.  They feel he is  a real Christian (we are all flawed!) despite him being a horrid person and not going to church, vs. Obama who was a church goer and a decent human.  And when Trump is actively being a horrid person, instead of passively being horrid, so many of them cheer him for it."

I hear this a lot from people who are afraid of being hated for being American.  I just tell people I'm American and everyone is completely nice to me.  Why not just be a good person, then when they find out you are American you help dispel the stereotype?

I'm not sure anyone has been extra nice to me because I'm American, but probably more-so because they just see a human lost, or confused, and they decide to help.  They are a human who sees another human."
