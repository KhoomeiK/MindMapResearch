AskReddit,fgrqqod,t1_fgq0ka7,1581054383.0,"It's true. Our bathroom somehow doesn't even have a toilet paper holder on the wall because the way they oriented everything. It's super annoying. Also, I have no clue why the hell our builder decided our bathroom should go in the middle of the house. ALL The sound transfers through a wall to the dining room. Even with the fans on. But because of that stupid open floorplan craze, we were lucky to find a house with a hallway at all! Bathrooms should go on an outer wall of the house, preferably down a hallway from the living room/kitchen and in like, the back corner of the house!  They put the toilet on the same wall that goes to the dining room in both bathrooms. I would have put the toilet on the opposite wall, and oriented it so that the shower was where the toilet is. Then you don't have noise issues or smell issues. and if a bathroom is in the master, for the love of God put the toilet in its own freaking room so that way it's not just a toilet sitting in the middle of an open space! Why is that even a thing? The best house layouts are from the 50s. There were separate rooms for everything."

If someone has proven time and time again that they are not capable of taking care of themselves, we need a different system to help them. That said we also have to make sure that the system allows workers to be trained, have stress leave and protection from burnout because that also helps the patients get good care.

Get up and walk around for like 10 mins for every hour that you are sitting/laying down. It helps the blood move around so you don't have any issues with clotting. So I would get up, go to the bathroom, get a drink of water and go outside the house for a few mins. Then go back to resting. If you fall asleep, then that's fine. But once you wake up get up and move around for a bit \[just take it very slow!\]  Moving around is exhausting at first.

endometriosis,fgethmk,t3_ey25py,1580709421.0,"I'm sorry that your nurse was so bad! Is this going to be a different hospital?  Tell your nurses about your experience last time, in that. Tell them you are scared and very anxious. I had never had any sort of surgery before, and I had to get a D & C last year, and then a laparoscopy to remove an ovarian cyst/my ovary. I was a total mess because Anesthesia scares me so much. I was sobbing in the wait area and the nurses were so kind and so helpful. I literally told the anesthesiologist that I was scared, that I get anxiety, and that I also suffer from motion sickness so I was worried about throwing up. The anesthesiologist gave me anti anxiety meds in the IV, along with anti nausea medicine in the IV, and they put Tylenol in it too. When I woke up I was just so happy it was over with and that I was safe and warm.  I was VERY groggy because I was under for 2 hours since things were more complicated than they expected. That said, the nurses were so so sweet and kind. They reassured me, and most of them had been through the same thing. . Deep breathing also REALLY really helps with getting the anesthesia out of your system. I did deep breathing exercises and convinced myself that those inflatable things they put around your legs were a leg massage, and focused on how happy I was that I was warm and safe.  I had my partner bring me a post op drink that's got electrolytes in it. We also stopped for food at In N Out. \[the nurses were laughing when I told them that was where I was going and said they do the same thing.\]  Also do not underestimate your pain when they ask you how it is when you come out of surgery! I was in A LOT of pain and in my stupor I said it was a 4. Thankfully the nurse knew I was actually at probably a 7 and gave me pain meds that instantly helped.   Also the laparoscopy recovery was not bad, but it was hard. You will need someone there with you to drive you home. Take a pillow to put between your stomach and the seatbelt.  I bought protein powder and pretty much lived off of smoothies for the 2 weeks after my surgery because they were easy to make and had nutrients. Protein powder, coconut water, almond butter, coconut or whatever milk you want, plus frozen fruit. Then I wasn't eating junk food but it was not involved meals. My discharge nurse was not great at explaining recovery unfortunately. Buy yourself some large bandages and paper tape and a tub of aquaphor off of amazon. Also some sterilization spray for ""hard to heal wounds"" is great for spraying the beegezus out of your belly button with because it will clean it without hurting any of the healing. I changed my bandages 48 hours after my surgery. I took a shower and faced away from the water and let the water run down my front and it cleaned everything. Changing the bandages was terrifying, but it was not bad and I felt SO MUCH better after being able to do that because I could always make sure they were clean.  Get yourself some comfy pants that are like 2 sizes too big, and I got a fuzzy sweatshirt that felt like i was wearing a stuffed animal because having the furry fabric on was like wearing a blanket and it was comforting.  All in all everything went well I think, and I am grateful I was able to have the surgery because it has helped my health so much in general. I just feel much better.  I also looked up videos on youtube from physical therapists on how to get in and out of bed after a surgery. Before the surgery I practiced getting up and down from the toilet just using my leg muscles which helped a TON when the time came. But you will be wobbly, so it's best to take things slow. Also no one told me that anesthesia interferes with how your brain communicates with your bladder. So it may take a little while when you sit down to pee for things to actually start working. I would just relax on the toilet and focus on peeing until it started. The issue resolved after probably 3 days, but it was very weird and I thought something was seriously wrong until I looked it up. Sorry this is the longest post EVER.  Hopefully some of it helps you!"

I usually have 22 day cycles and the doctor keeps telling me the Femara will help it lengthen but that has not been the case. At the same time I feel like the last two runs with the Femara my body didn't know wtf was happening and now it finally has adjusted. I have been testing every day since day 5 of my cycle and it was getting darker and now it's light again. Really I'm not sure what the point of posting on here is other than getting some commiseration and not feeling so crazy for how ridiculous this stuff is to figure out sometimes.  Also when I called they were like ""Oh ya we want you to come in on cycle day 12.. Which would be tomorrow, Monday but that's the doctors surgery day.

I have short cycles, they were 22 days with ovulation on 7 days after the last day of my period.  We have an appointment with them next week, so I guess I'll see if that's what they are going to do.

Residents rifle through cookies. People manhandle all the donuts.

I asked for it, they had mentioned it the first time before I started taking the medicine and then acted like I was nuts when I called and asked for ultrasounds and if I needed to get trigger shots. They had my buy the clear blue easy tests and thank god I had the Amazon ovulation tests too because the CBE ones suck! They aren't sensitive enough for my hormone levels and just show no surge even though the amazon ones clearly show it when it happens. Last two cycles I got an almost surge. This time looks like it is going better. But my amh levels are so low. I'm angry that no doctor ever even mentioned fertility testing to me when I was younger. Why didn't anyone tell me to get all this shit done when I was 27? The doctors would ask if I was planning on having kids, I would say yes, and they would say ""Oh well you still have time"" If I had gotten these tests done back then I would have had a much better idea what was happening and could have worked with things much better."

I had to have an ovary removed last year, so I expected the number to drop but not quite so badly. I'm 38 years old. I feel like time is running out. The Femara they have me on doesn't seem to be doing anything. My progesterone levels were super low. I'm just running out of hope after seeing the numbers. I knew when the doctors office called me that it wasn't good. and now they're basically saying we get 2 more cycles on Femara and that's it. I just don't know what else I'm going to do."

It takes months and months for the bones to heal and for people to learn to walk again. and if you just lay in the hospital bed and refuse to do PT and treat it like a hotel stay, you will probably end up permanently in a wheelchair from the muscles atrophying to the point where there is no return.

No one walks up to your friend and your partner and just starts screaming at them unless you already knew they were cheating or something. Movies always make everything so over the top."

Futurology,ffh91d8,t1_ffgao5o,1579926607.0,"There is a stoplight on the way home that is notorious for this. It actually is literally faster to make a right hand turn, u turn, make another right hand turn, uturn , than to sit through the red light if it's past 10 pm. One time I timed how long it had me sitting there with NO traffic in any direction at all, and it was something like 8 minutes. My friend who used to have to drive past it on his way home from his night shift job would get stuck at it sometimes for up to 10 minutes. My mom also got stuck at it all the time on the way to work early in the morning.  It's on the main road home too so there was no way to avoid going through it and being stuck at a red light at 2 am with zero traffic in any direction is the most annoying thing."

If they were not going to do that I was just going to find someone to give it to.\], a build a bear coupon that I gave to a family who had a couple of little kids. They were talking about going and were saying it was probably expensive, so at least if they got a free animal for one kid the cost would be easier to handle. They were super excited.   I basically won what was supposed to be a package for a kid. The cruise director also was not my favorite. she was screaming at everyone who won saying we were not ""excited"" enough for her and threatening to take away peoples prizes for not screaming and jumping up and down.

SLO,ff86wtv,t3_eofm7l,1579667711.0,"Grew up here. I feel like the culture of SLO Matches Van Life in theory. But then because of the homeless population you will get a lot of people who report you for parking near them. If you make friends with people maybe you can figure out a way to park in someones driveway regularly? I feel like that's probably going to be your easiest option. Rent a college kids driveway or something.  The weather is great. Lots of hiking and outdoors stuff. Housing market is horrible. Job market is probably the same as everywhere else right now. It's not diverse at all. SLO is very similar to Santa Barbara in many ways. Honestly I would be wary of where you park outside of town because we also have a huge drug problem/gang problem, and an influx of criminals from the Valley.

But it seriously is easy to fall into the trap of ""oh it's just one cookie/one donut/one piece of cake"" except that I realized last year one month that I had eaten more donuts in 2 months than years in my regular life put together. In my regular life I MAYBE get a donut once a year as a treat. I still have to lose about 30 lbs. I need to stop eating so much sugar! I remember in high school I stopped eating sugar and I lost 20 lbs without doing a thing."
