Then memes somehow became a big political influence, gerrymandering (despite zones not being redrawn), and voter suppression, despite the most controversial states not being near the border.

We're coming into a new election and you're still too emotionally unstable from not getting your way almost 4 years ago.  Blame it on whatever you would like, but at least do something this year instead of fishing for excuses for something 4 years old"

business,fc01mcf,t1_fbzyz21,1577273854.0,"I believe you treat it as a commodity, which allows you to take annual depreciation and deduct a weird assortment of expenses to further mitigate taxes if the show does well, and if it flops, you csn write the production costs off like a negative investment, and essentially have 4 shitty shows that offset the gains of one profitable one, which you then keep nearly all of the revenue while avoiding tax liability"

I could see Netflix getting away with depreciating their production costs since it's impossible to associate any revenue to a single show/stand-up/etc, even with viewer metrics, simply because they're a subscription service and their library is so expansive that it's virtually impossible to connect any amount of revenue generated to a specific show.  I hadn't heard that before, but it's actually a pretty clever way of manipulating accounting deductions."

business,fbzwv77,t1_fbzkqfb,1577265987.0,"No, I didn't.  You argued with my initial post that I had to pick between capital investment and profitability.  The only time I ever referenced  their initial capital was in my response to you, and I didn't add the word initial after the fact.... You made a ridiculous argument, got called on it, and now you're trying to find any way out of seeming completely incompetent. 

I completely disagree that driver acquisition has ever been a huge hurdle for any ridesharing company.  People choose to do this kind of work to supplement their incomes.  Uber isn't going to job fairs and asking people to sign up as drivers because that part of the supply and demand equation is obviously readily available. 

Customer acquisition should be a problem due to their former acceptance of literally any driver and their complete ignorance of customer complaints.  After several viral videos and stories of horrible experiences surfaced, they still pushed back against consumer requests for some level of driver screening, which allowed other companies to chip away at their market share. 

The business doesn't work because of how it's structured, and it's not because of driver retention.  They pay a new driver the same as a long term driver, so it's a revolving door of temporary employees, but certainly no shortage.  Their problem is how the public perceives their services due to their former corporate mentality.

Very odd comparison considering prior to Amazon Prime TV, they were exclusively a commodity driven company, whereas Uber has exclusively sold a service..."
