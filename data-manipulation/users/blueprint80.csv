Iota,ffk7f3v,t1_ffjwka0,1580018171.0,"Ok thank you. So as I understand the tps is growing with the network? My question is, with growing M2M economy and ever increasing amount of transactions, will the network’s tps naturally grow to accommodate the growing demand? And what will be the estimated amount of transactions in a fully developed M2M economy, let say, in 10 years? Will be tangle able to accommodate this? Thanks to anyone that can bring this issue to a better clarity."
Iota,ffizivc,t3_etw5nm,1579986589.0,Can anyone explain me... 40 tps for a M2M economy looks quite small. I was expecting like 1000s of tps.

Can you please justify this dilution of the token pool to your investors?"

Dublin,feoqa2h,t1_fenwp6h,1579303860.0,"This is a great work.  The most simplest, effective and efficient way to implement UBI is through cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. We are slowly witnessing a huge shakedown of our old financial system that is no longer serving to a greater good for most of the citizens. The whole financial system will be replaced with blockchain based financial services in next decade and thus the implementation of UBI will be a natural and easy step. We still need to do some progress in regards of the infrastructure, security, software and hardware of blockchain based systems but the technological progress in this space is enormous."
insolar,felde2p,t1_felb2n4,1579219546.0,"It can, you are right. And it may not.  But independently of the possible future profits, this swap is an automatic 4x devaluation of your investment."
insolar,fekxa6e,t3_epiz0d,1579209510.0,"So just to recap: INSOLAR is increasing supply of tokens 40x, but swapping INS for XNS just 10x. 
That is an automatic 4x devaluation of the initial investment."
