depression,ffjw58a,t1_ffia4ya,1580008581.0,"I recognize the brain fog and ease of getting hurt by others' words from my own history with chronic depression and unstable personality. If you're in the same boat, does your psych try to help you confront and overcome the past so it can't hurt you anymore? With like CBT or some kind of guided therapy like that? And do you have a strong sense of your own identity (character traits, goals, etc...) that can stand and support you regardless of what trolls decide to say?"
depression,ffjvwqu,t1_ffin0wk,1580008402.0,"I know how that can go. Are the chems keeping you from doing things? Have you had success with detox, stepdown or anything else? How about taking the many tasks and chores and splitting them up into small and easy steps to babystep through them one hour or day at a time?"
depression,ffi0rlv,t1_ffhzl8d,1579961581.0,"I see the cycle between social anxiety and not having the work. If it's something cognitive like a flood of self-hating or anxiety-filled thoughts keeping you from talking to others, I hope you can powerfully confront and correct those thoughts to keep your mind as solid as possible for talking with others. Then maybe you can have some good success with babystepping better social ability into your skillset like I did... actually, my first practice convo with a girl I didn't know was only 30 seconds long and pretty sad, but it got a bit longer with other people on every attempt, you know?

Or if this is too much, maybe you can look into work as a dishwasher, Uber driver or something else that doesn't require that much social interaction, if for no other reason than to put distance between you and your family so you can find the wiggle room to spread out and get to the good places you want to be."
depression,ffhtuir,t1_ffhtlfp,1579953602.0,"Do the depression and anxiety stem from the trauma? That was absolutely my case. I spent so much time coping from and suppressing my rotten childhood instead of confronting and correcting what I could, that it acted as a slow poison that manifested in depression, anxiety... and also in things like pessimistic overthinking and stress crashes."
depression,ffhtr3p,t1_ffhtatt,1579953466.0,"It sounds like a lot of troubles bearing down at once. Have you made a physical, pen to paper, list of everything going on so it's easier to catalogue, check out and strategize what you can? When I was in the thick of my suicidal depression, trying to acknowledge issues one by one in my mind was like trying to grab fish."
depression,ffht60y,t1_ffhsug0,1579952613.0,"Well, can I just say it's good she's gone so she can't hurt you anymore? With just your father there, that should keep the number of gaslighters very low in your life. Have you been to any kind of pro or therapist to get the trauma examined and dealt with, even if you have to self-therapize with CBT techniques like I did? It's good you're physically away from the people who messed with you so badly, but I hope the next thing you can do is to get the inner darkness thoroughly confronted and banished for good."

depression,ffhszww,t3_etpla9,1579952359.0,That's an excellent goal to have. Is there anything specific you can identify that's causing your isolation and keeping you from those social links you deserve?
depression,ffhsyxg,t3_etpgdp,1579952317.0,Is there anything going on that you can identify that makes you want to take your life? Is it something you think can't be solved that's hurting you so much?
depression,ffhsxci,t3_etpeuy,1579952254.0,"I know exactly how you feel. 14-21, and somewhat up to 25, was a complete garbage dump for me, and I didn't overcome everything and find a life worth living until my mid-20s. But looking back on it now from my 30s, getting there late was infinitely better than never getting there at all. I sincerely hope the very best for you too."
depression,ffhsvck,t3_etpe4a,1579952171.0,"If the source of her pain is taking on too many challenges at once to live up to an idealized image of herself that she can't reach so quick, it might be best for her to scale back responsibilities here and there and to reform her image of her ideal self less as a perfect woman, and more a woman doing her best.

But if this goes deeper than the external pressure and personality formation issues, she might need to see a professional to identify what the underlying root cause is. From your end, the best you can do without a pro is to try and put your heads together to see if there's anything harming her from within like past trauma, suppressed memory, cognitive habits of self-hatred or anxiety or pessimistic overthinking, or something like that."
depression,ffhsrsn,t3_etpdxt,1579952026.0,I think your father is doing and providing the right service and help for you as best he can. Is it possible to spend near all your family time with him and cut out every other of the people who have diminished and gaslighted your abuse as they have? I wasn't able to confront my suicidal depression until I was physically moved away from the multiple parents and childhood homes that messed me up good when I  was younger.

I remember from 19-21 I was trying to make steps towards helping myself overcome suicidal depression, but because it was all external (exercise, talking to people, studying, diet...) it left my mind open to sabotage from self-defeating anxiety, suicidal ideation and pessimistic overthinking that caused no end to the number of times I backslid..."

depression,ffec9vc,t1_ffeba9x,1579842871.0,"Ya, if so, mine was similar, though far less on the anxiety and far more on suicidal ideation, so I can relate. Have you had success in confronting, correcting, banishing and replacing those thoughts over a sustained period? 3 weeks to 3 months was my usual time getting stuff like that rooted out when I was undergoing CBT."
depression,ffec2q6,t1_ffe9oxk,1579842686.0,"Sure, I checked a couple and they all do well to explain. But this one, so far, nails it best:

Anything unclear, let me know. I've been through this type of therapy probably 6 times for various separate issues so it's almost down to a science for me. :D"
depression,ffe1947,t1_ffdzymx,1579834085.0,"Any time those thoughts come to your mind, immediately cut them off, mentally correct them and replace them with confidence, honest optimism or grit. Just make sure the response is a truthful one, because lying affirmations make things worse. Something like this:

""Girls hate you. Kill yourself.""
""I'm talking to more every day and getting better with them. I'm gonna fix this.""

(Later)

""Girls hate you. K...""
""I'm talking to more every day and getting better with them. I'm gonna fix this.""

(Later)

""Girls ha...""
""I'm talking to more every day and getting better with them. I'm gonna fix this.""

I had to do this a few times for some thoughts, dozens for others, hundreds for others, really depends on how long the thought has been reinforced. It takes a few weeks or months total, but as long as the counters are truthful, you can overturn thought patterns one by one. There are a couple sites out there talking about CBT that can really break it down for ya too.

Hope you make faster and better progress than you ever expected, or maybe find a process that works even better for you. :)"
depression,ffdx28a,t1_ffdwf46,1579831061.0,"That could be a strong move. Emotions are continuous thought that become habit, so changing and controlling them can require weeks or months of constant mental countering and redirection (I've had to do this probably 10 times!).

It gets repetitive, but think of it like this: if you want to stop a speeding car, applying the brakes doesn't provide much immediate change, but in time, the car will slow and you can then change directions.

The rest of it is largely in one big awful group and I feel you there. Is it overthinking, sabotaging self-hatred/anxiety, fear of judgement, or something else sourcing that stuff? I had all those and more, took months of CBT to finally confront and replace all that horrendous junk..."
depression,ffdvmo9,t1_ffdusew,1579830043.0,"Since my suicidal depression was sourced in a rotten childhood leading to cognitive habits of anxiety and self-hatred, which then led to a ruined social life and health situation, I had to combine CBT for the mental aspect with really slow planning and babystepping for the external stuff (talking to girls 30 more seconds each day, lifting one weight one more time every other day, etc...)."

depression,ffdtz28,t1_ffdtkor,1579828869.0,"That's fine, I never took meds myself, though I'm not knocking their effectiveness. If it's something based in the physical makeup of your brain, you might not have much choice, like any other disease... but if the source is in the mind (that suppressed memory, dark past or constant self-hatred), therapy can be of huge help without medication, depending on what the doc says."
depression,ffdtuhv,t1_ffdt363,1579828780.0,"I don't know about meds, but therapy is free if you look up the techniques and practices online.

depression,ffdtou1,t1_ffdsy29,1579828670.0,"The switch from high school to college is going to cause a huge fallout between friends and in social circles for sure, and it'll probably happen again going from college to work.

For the general feeling though, I think this might be more a case of depression/anxiety coloring your perception of the reactions of others (aside from the friend who hardly talks to you, that one's legit). Have you had a diagnosis of any kind regarding a general feeling of this type that might be sabotaging your thoughts and actions from within? It just sounds a lot like the crap I went through for 7 years where I thought people hated and were attacking me left and right, when it was just the depression fooling me all over the place."
depression,ffdtgiy,t3_et2609,1579828505.0,"It sounds like there's a lot of anger swirling around you and to and from every direction. Is the weight and social issue a large part of it, do you think, or are there other things that are making you feel this way? I know it's not easy to get through school with many issues going on at once, but is there anything under your direct control that you felt could be tweaked or changed in some good way?"
depression,ffdtal0,t3_et2c13,1579828386.0,"It was my comfortable but itchy blanket as well for almost 10 years. Do you have an idea of who you would be or what you would do if it wasn't in your life, like some kind of goal or dream you would rather have?"
depression,ffdt85c,t1_ffdsu5f,1579828336.0,"Is it because you fail at everything you try, or is it more than depression is coloring your perception of the actions you take and making it seem worse than it is? Because if it's about perception, you might have to consider some kind of mental confrontation or rearranging (CBT, DBT, etc...) to get your thoughts organized and better under control, and believe me, I know about the overanalysis very well.

But if you need to skill up, it might be more an issue of needing to cut big projects into smaller, step by step parts so you can focus on fixing things piece by piece instead of being surrounded by all the things you need to take care of or don't have yet. I know how easy it can be to get overwhelmed."
depression,ffdsxc3,t3_et2aqk,1579828120.0,"Do you have the trouble I did where I constantly overanalyzed and overthought everything, and allowed my thoughts to pull me to every dark corner of my mind (bad old memories, self-hatred, anxiety...) instead of directly taking control of them and bringing them where they should be?"
depression,ffdsst8,t3_et26yu,1579828027.0,"Is it something genetic or family based do you think, or more of using weed as a way to submerge and suppress dark thoughts of some kind that is causing the issue? If the weed stopped affecting one or the other I could see how depression could be coming through, but seeking healing from either stabilizing through meds or therapy depends hard on what the source is."
depression,ffdsn85,t1_ffdsc77,1579827912.0,"I understand that very well, it sounds like a lot of external pressure squeezing in at the same time. But is there anything striking from the inside, like suppressed memory of a dark past, constantly agreeing with thoughts of anxiety or self-hatred, or out of control overthinking and overanalyzing many things at once? These internal strikes can make it easy for external things to push in harder than they should."
depression,ffdsfus,t3_et25az,1579827772.0,What is it that makes you think everyone is disliking you at the same time? Is it something specific or more of a general feeling you get from the people around you?
depression,ffdsc8v,t3_et2331,1579827705.0,"When you try to take on tasks, do you focus on the entire process or the goal all at once instead of breaking things into bite-sized and easy chunks? And when you do work, do you allow and agree with thoughts of anxiety, self-hatred, pessimism or the like instead of confronting and combatting them? I know that when I was in the thick of my suicidal depression, the combination of hyperfocusing on the totality of my failures while constantly barraging myself from the inside with thoughts of how much I couldn't handle it was a constant double strike of losing motivation."
depression,ffds1t4,t3_et21sc,1579827511.0,"Have you made a physical list, pencil to paper, of anything and everything you wanted to change and improve your life, given the chance?

In my case, when I had global thoughts of hating myself completely or everyone around me but without specific reasons, it was the filter of chronic depression sabotaging and poisoning everything in my life, rather than being something that was true and needing to be fixed."
depression,ffdrqd9,t1_ffdr8br,1579827298.0,"Sounds like a real bad one, and more of a med giver than a psychologist or therapist so you'd be far better off going to someone different and better than him."
depression,ffdrmpc,t3_et1yo4,1579827229.0,"Really sorry about this awful condition for you, bud. If you continued with surgery and treatment, would it be fixable past 50%? If it got fixed, would things possibly get better for you in other areas as well like hobbies, school, etc...?"
depression,ffdrfyn,t3_et1w0r,1579827104.0,"Continuing the meds at a doc's behest I think would be an important first step. After that, though, do you have a hyperspecific diagnosis of where your Bipolar is sourced? If it's something entirely genetic or chemical, then the meds might be the only thing standing between you and being unwell.

But if it's something more cognitive like mine was (I had massive Borderline tendencies for almost 10 years due almost entirely to suppressed memory and cognitive habits of self-hatred), then the meds might be better used as backup for therapy of some kind, therapy meant to get out of control overanalyzing thoughts and everything else under your firm control and direction."
depression,ffdr5hf,t3_et1vkr,1579826916.0,"Excellent to hear! I think it's especially effective using a med as a backup army to make changes like you describe at the same time (having a routine, combatting negative thoughts, etc...). Go go!"
depression,ffdr1q8,t3_et1vjt,1579826852.0,"Generalized anxiety or chronic depression can do it. Have you had a diagnosis of uneven brain chemistry sourced in genetic or family history, or do you spend a lot of time either suppressing dark memories or agreeing with thoughts of self-hatred?"
depression,ffdqyj2,t1_ffdq6qd,1579826794.0,"It's not, and I'm very sorry about what happened to you. Have you had any success in confronting and dealing with that memory, whether it's through personal mental confrontation, or better, with a pro of some kind? I had a rotten childhood for almost the entire 18 years and couldn't even begin to make strides against my suicidal depression until I mentally faced down all the things I went through with CBT."
depression,ffdqsw4,t3_et1vci,1579826695.0,"I think a good question would be to who or what put that voice in your head that you feel worthless and shouldn't ask others for help. Any leads on its source, so you can properly identify, confront, correct and replace that inner monologue?"
depression,ffdqol3,t3_et1uj8,1579826621.0,"It sounds like a lot of your social links are off on their own things for one reason or another.

depression,ffdqacz,t3_et1sjy,1579826373.0,"I had almost the exact same experience but spread across two girls. The first was a girl I asked out who said yes, then changed her mind the next day to not damage the friendship, and we never really talked again. Several other girls made me into their emotional friends while I was trying to move our relationships slowly from friendship to dating, and if I made any attempt to step outside of my emotional sounding board role, they either bailed on the relationship or got really upset.

If you want to move this relationship to dating, I doubt there's anything you can do about it besides move on to someone else. If you want to keep the platonic relationship, she probably has it in her mind that you'll be the one to hear about her dating experiences, so you'll either have to accept it or choose not to and meet someone else. For the time being, give her a day or two of space with no texts then try again. I suspect your next text to her will be your final chance, if my experience is anything to go by."
depression,ffdpvc2,t3_et1q1a,1579826109.0,"I know the feeling. When you try and make attempts to consider or act on helping yourself, do you hyperfocus too much on the goals you want to get to instead of the steps towards them?

But I think the most important thing is finding some mental and life-based stability away from what you were put through in your childhood. I underwent CBT, but if you can find something perfectly suited for you and even better, I hope you can find it real quick. You deserve better than to have those old wounds continuously scratch at your mind."
depression,ffblv4v,t1_ffbllcj,1579771734.0,"I can totally relate. It's good that you've moved out, but I fear the memories and thought patterns may have followed you where you currently are, which is what happened with me. Have you had any luck confronting, correcting and replacing these old memories instead of holding them down or ignoring them? For me, letting them sit in my mind just let them fester and get worse over time, and until I underwent CBT (self-therapized), that voice was always there to screech at me, no matter where I was or what I was doing."
depression,ffblsm5,t1_ffblcdn,1579771629.0,"I can definitely relate. Do you think it's related to a fear of judgement or rejection, or more of a general self-dislike or overthinking anxiety that paralyzes you from the outset? I had all of this and more... took months of therapy to get that voice out of my head and replaced with a much better one."
depression,ffblqmc,t1_ffbl0hk,1579771545.0,"Ya, I know all about that. I dealt with that for 2 1/2 years before I finally snapped and started yelling, nearly screaming at my wife for about half an hour about everything she had done to wreck our relationship, ruin our finances and waste time around the house (I worked all day and took care of all the chores and watching the kid for years while she did nearly nothing). I never yelled that way at her before so I probably shocked her pretty good.

It helps that I'm keenly aware with the way women typically argue so I could counter any of her attempts to derail or whatever. Basically, they'll either respond to every good logical point by changing the subject, namecalling, strawmanning, or trying to bring up an exception to disprove a rule (i.e. ""I cooked breakfast once last month, so you're wrong to say that I hardly cook!""). You defeat this by immediately stopping her attempt to dodge, then repeating the first statement you made until you get an answer.

The other thing they do is emotional manipulation where they'll flit between the three emotions of offended denial, roaring rage and screeching tears. It's effectively manipulative until you realize how fake it is for them to cry for 20 seconds then suddenly the tears are gone, and the angry lies come back out again. Again, just stay on topic.

For the next 6 months or so after the blowup, I never smiled, never asked for sex anymore (and rejected her attempts to come at me multiple times when she used to cut me off for 3 months or more), and just acted like a real jerk. After she got with the program and started doing things a partner should be doing, i.e. work or take care of the house, at least something, I eased up on the a-hole personality until I was back to normal.

Things are way better now, but wives being wives, she'll try and test me every couple of weeks or so with some extremely rude comment or stupid behavior, but I shut her down immediately. Now that she knows I don't need her for sex, meals, chores, money or anything else, she's keenly aware of who the boss is now and doesn't dare treat me the way she used to anymore. And she gets to be the semi-pampered wife again, just with way better treatment towards me."
depression,ffblbs6,t1_ffbkw3j,1579770917.0,"If by gone you mean getting moved out and away from that environment, I can't agree with you more. When I left for college 20 years ago, I felt better for leaving that place, though the thoughts of self-hatred followed me to college and I had to get therapy to remove them for good. But moving out was the important first step. How much longer do you have before you can leave?"
depression,ffbl9rz,t3_esq4o8,1579770832.0,"My suicidal depression hit me at 14 as a kind of general, mild anxiety with mild self-dislike, and for the next 7 years developed into full blown self-hatred and suicidal ideation. I even tried to take my life 5 separate times with 4 separate methods.

But after undergoing CBT for several months, I eventually started to overcome the disjointed, plagued and painful memories and cognitive patterns. It's been years since, and I can hopefully answer some of those questions:

Fully recover - I'm doing fine, though I have days where I wish I could fast forward and finish quick to get back to bed. These days are rare, maybe once a season.

Negative thoughts - They come, but I immediately counter and dismiss them. It's like seeds of rotten plants blowing into my garden, but I swat them out before they can get under the soil and grow.

Sleep refreshment - Ya, most of the time, things are great here, unless I slept on my neck wrong or something.

Daily care - I can get lazy on shaving, but showers, eating, lifting, all no problem now, compared to before.

Happy - I'm confident in what I can do and what will happen and don't give up easily. Not a smile-all-the-time type, but things are definitely all right."

depression,ffbl0vq,t3_esqc7z,1579770450.0,"Absolutely, when I was in the thick of my suicidal depression, it messed with my ability to focus and remember things so badly that I had to turn on closed captioning to understand people speaking my own language on TV, and dragged my grades into the sewer.

Is your anxiety or other mental troubles sourced in something genetic or family based that you need medication to even out? Or is it more of a cognitive thing where you try to suppress dark memories, or agree with and allow thoughts of self-hatred instead of combatting them? Mine was the last two put together."
depression,ffbkwh8,t3_esqblz,1579770259.0,"It's common for most people to be there because there are only so many leadership positions to go around, whether it's for work or friends or anything else. Is it that you want more people to offer you support and understanding, or to include you in activities, stuff like that?"

depression,ffbkt13,t3_esq7a2,1579770113.0,"I've had weight issues on and off for a while, and I know in my case, one big cause was trying to eat away mental issues... so getting therapy for the mental issues helped to break that cycle more. As for the hunger pangs, it was mostly a process of my stomach shrinking and flooding me with hunger chems, so if I just rode the wave out for a day or 3 to let the stomach shrink back to normal size, the hunger chems got much more manageable."
depression,ffbkqzv,t3_esq5o9,1579770027.0,"Sounds a lot like the up and downwaves of chronic depression, if my experience is anything to go by. Do you have a lock on where yours is sourced, if this is the case? I had a voice of self-deprecation and self-hatred put in there by a rotten childhood and bad parents and it took months of therapy to finally confront, correct and banish that crap from my life for good."
depression,ffbkp8l,t3_esq3v8,1579769953.0,"I can relate to the long lengths of depression, along with capping it off with a fight-filled relationship with someone I thought I could trust. My wife hardly did much to help around the house or with our relationship for years and yet, still felt entitled to demand more from me every day while she gave less and less. Is your wife in that kind of hostile dependant mode like mine was, or is she also working or doing stuff and taking out her frustrations on you?"
depression,ffbkl8o,t3_esq0l1,1579769789.0,"Mine hit at 14 and continued to 21 so I feel you there. Do you think that your upbringing had something to do with depression's onset? I know mine was, and I wasn't able to get anywhere near dealing with it until I first physically got away from my parents and childhood home, before I could finally mentally confront the voice they put there."
depression,ffbkjgn,t3_esq0k0,1579769713.0,"I know how it is to feel like you have nothing to offer. If you could develop any skill, characteristics or traits to offer even more of yourself to others, what would they be? Have you had success going for those specific things, or are there things standing in your way?"
depression,ffbajcj,t1_ffanwk6,1579757504.0,"Awesome, good to hear! I couldn't mentally confront and replace that inner darkness until I first put over 100 miles between me and the rotten childhood, then a literal ocean after that. I'm so far removed from those old days, I can't imagine going back physically or mentally. Glad you're on the same road. :D"
depression,ffamtjd,t1_ff9pmni,1579739639.0,"That's an excellent idea to move out for better prospects in work and relationships. It was a big one for me.

Did you want to put on mass to increase your chances in dating? Have you had luck in lifting 2 or 3 times a week to failure? I didn't give a toss about tone so I just kept adding more weight, more weight every 2 or 3 weeks.

Some people have a swimmer's body. My arms look like two hams and I'm overweight from the lifting hunger... but the girls' attention to me is still like night and day."
depression,ffamcma,t1_ffaf1xa,1579739319.0,"Ah, sounds like you had a voice put in your head like me. Mine criticized everything I did to the point of suicidal ideation. Are you physically away from your mother? I found it impossible to mentally separate myself from the voice or the past until the people or places I was hurt by were out of my life and far away."
depression,ffam0um,t1_ff95hzi,1579739099.0,"Sure, anywhere with your interests there (hobby shop, book club...) or with people who'll be more up to making friends (activity club, work mixer, study group, church). I made friends online through language exchange and met up F2F later."
depression,ff8pnz6,t1_ff8pjm3,1579690677.0,"No problem, even if it's something easy like a hobby or skill, it's a definite and powerful starting point. Gaming, surfing, language, travel, hiking, you pick whatever you want and make it a good one, ya? :D"
depression,ff8pab5,t1_ff8ol14,1579690123.0,"Ah, sorry for the misunderstanding. It sounds like you're doing excellently in the attraction part at least, and that's great. I agree with bar and club frequenters not making for the most interesting or stable of relationships.

I think it's ok to be picky because if you're going for a LTR or marriage, that'll be your partner for good. Do you have a set of criteria firmly laid out for yourself so you know that when you meet the best girl for you, you'll have strong reason to keep things going strong and happy between you two?"
depression,ff8p73t,t1_ff8ohos,1579689993.0,"I can understand that. Do you have a strong sense of a ""victory condition"" for yourself so you can arrive at some kind of goal and think, ""Well, finally here.""? I know what it's like to have a kind of unclear notion of wanting something like love or safety but never feeling satisfied... but having a very specific number or goal made it easier for me to think that I was finally in the place I was working for, you know?"
depression,ff8p4mr,t1_ff8of6w,1579689891.0,"Ah, I can totally relate. That far-but-close things went on with me and one of my parents for years before I finally set boundaries for that person and me. Things are going a lot better now. Whatever you choose to get everything well with you, I hope things go even better for you too. :D"

depression,ff8o71j,t1_ff8o451,1579688488.0,"That's cool, if your doc is trained in that, you can ask her to switch styles for a while and see how it is. I did CBT on myself and looked up the techniques online (trial and error) and it worked powerfully, I can't imagine how it goes with a pro at your side. :D

Good luck and I hope you find 10x the success 10x quicker than you expected!"
depression,ff8o4m6,t3_es9u42,1579688389.0,"You can open up to them in a positive way like ""Ya, I'm going through a rough time and kinda clueless on what to do. Wanna meet up and see if we can find out anything I can do?""

Personally in the thick of my suicidal depression, I chose the route to keep up a happy face for my friends while I secretly did therapy on myself (CBT) so I could keep my dark secrets to myself while I let my friends be my oasis from the mental confrontations and cognitive remapping. It was a good cycle of self-therapy exhaustion, friend recharging."
depression,ff8o1mc,t3_es9r4j,1579688264.0,"Have you had any success in confronting, correcting and replacing those thoughts? I suffered with having a ""voice"" like that in my mind for 7 years and allowing it to not only run crazy through my mind, but to agree with it as well. It takes weeks or months of sustained countering and control to remove a voice like that, but with some good therapy like CBT, DBT or ACT, whatever works for you, it can be done."
depression,ff8nzgu,t3_es9qxy,1579688174.0,"Really sorry about where you're at right now. Have you been able to confront, combat and replace those memories and thoughts of the abuse?

Please do your best to combat them as much as you can and refocus your mind on what you would like to do now that your ex has left your life. There's a big her-shaped hole in your mind and it's going to take time of confronting those feelings, and converting them into happy reminiscence or apathy or something besides longing for her. Take your time, and I hope you get some good plans going soon, bud."
depression,ff8nua6,t3_es9nvy,1579687956.0,"Your English is quite good. Are there groups of people you want to hang with who only speak English? I think you'd get along well with them.

Why do you think you won't be happy? Have you tried fixing things going wrong and been hurt or pushed back a lot?"
depression,ff8nszy,t3_es9myp,1579687901.0,"I think you should be proud of the strength you've put into your relationship and everything else so far. Are the meds for a genetic or brain chemistry issue to keep you even for good, or is it more of a backup help system for your time with the therapist? Is your therapist not going on so well? Is it because they're a more hands-off type (""How does that make you feel?"") or something else? Personally, hands-on CBT type therapy helped me a lot more with my many cognitive issues and I probably would have chafed under a hands-off type of therapy."
depression,ff8npgd,t3_es9lpi,1579687749.0,"I hope you can find that time away from school, work or anything else. I took a months-long hiatus from college myself, and repeated the year I left as a way to ease back into uni and finish up my study."
depression,ff8no3h,t3_es9l6s,1579687692.0,"I know well the effect of a rotten childhood on someone, even if they physically get away from the source. Are you all moved out and away from the alcohol and mess of your childhood? Have you been able to confront the inner darkness and rotten memories so you can correct, combat and replace them?

depression,ff8nlu4,t3_es9hrb,1579687596.0,"If things are going externally well but internally seem to be dark or falling apart, do you think it could be something genetic or brain chemistry based?

Or could it be more like my case, where I had a rotten childhood and spent so much time suppressing memory of my time then that I ended up creating an emotional habit of desiring death that got embedded and continuously cycled through my mind?"
depression,ff8njru,t3_es9hei,1579687508.0,"At 18, I think it's possible that the flow of high school is gone or soon to be gone, leaving you with the task of planning the kind of future you want to make for yourself, which includes both your identity and your goal (relationship, career, etc...). Without those in place, I think it gets real easy to spend days on end with drugs, vidya and whatnot... at least it was for me. Do you have anything good planned for your future, or any inklings of things that could be plans soon enough?"
depression,ff8nhi9,t3_es9egs,1579687412.0,"When you try to meet girls for relationships now, is it easier to get too nice or even clingy compared to before? I can't say for sure, but I think your and my life are completely the opposite in that I spent 17-21 being really nice to girls to try and slowly move friendships to dating and it never worked... but at 21 I simultaneously bought a motorcycle, lifted, dieted, shaved, changed my fashion, went through therapy and increased confidence and social skill through practice, and I was dating my first less than 3 months later."
depression,ff8neam,t3_es9dve,1579687273.0,"I'm really sorry about your situation, but I'm glad you've at least considered dental implants or something similar.

Maybe even a second job or something?"
depression,ff8hzuq,t1_ff7rn0l,1579679362.0,"That was a lot of pressure to take with outhome isolation and inhome bad parenting. I know, I've been there. When you left the country to leave the chaos behind that was an excellent first step.
