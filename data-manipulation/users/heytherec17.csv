Dentistry,ff54wus,t1_ff54ul8,1579580332.0,They need to make sure the fluids are flowing and they may do a few other things/ask a few more questions (ask if you’re feeling good and such) before the sedation.
Dentistry,ff54n9x,t3_eroq7z,1579580115.0,"You may be able to ask for a slightly smaller gauge needle; smaller gauge can sometimes be slightly less painful. They usually can do smaller gauge for blood draw but for IV it’s not always possible, just gotta ask your provider what they’re willing to do. Also ask for an older nurse to do it, they’re typically more skilled and can do a lot better job. 

They’ll put the Iv in and about 5 mins or so later when they’re sure it’s properly in then you’ll likely get the sedation going and you’re right out in <10 seconds.

-source: I was getting bloodwork every 3 months for a while, have been under Iv sedation 3-4 times and can tell the difference between gauges and just repeating what I’ve been told. I’m not afraid of needles but I understand your fear. There were plenty of times I didn’t want the discomfort.

Tightening up will make it worse and they may have to redo it. Don’t watch them and just use your non Iv arm to hold the arm of the chair and deep breathe. And tell them not to tell you when it’s happening."
