Thank you for this xx"
relationship_advice,fcuw2vg,t1_fcuvcvw,1577989711.0,"We definitely decided to quit drinking that’s our promise to each other because this only happens like this when we do. 

Should i care about what the in laws are saying? They are telling him to leave me."
relationship_advice,fcuv2is,t1_fcuuwq9,1577989125.0,"It’s every month or so. It happens erratically. Like such as example Feb, may.june, august. November, December.  Huge huge fights. We always have been drinking too."
relationship_advice,fcuuy3u,t1_fcutfmy,1577989050.0,"You’re right I know. 

100% true. 
I’m trying my best to figure out my plan"
relationship_advice,fcuuvjy,t1_fcuujbc,1577989007.0,"I totally know he’s abusive and I need to get out that’s the issue in itself. I don’t want to go through life like that. I just need to understand why my in laws are thinking like this. One fight in front of them drunk? & they are making it to sucha deal that aren’t giving him consequences yet making me seem the bad guy. 

It’s just tough."

You deserve so much better and It sound contradicting coming from me but still. Next time make a police report. That’s what I’m going to do too. We are both survivors and I am so proud of you for choosing to rewrite yours

I don’t know what age has to do with it but I feel like I’m just a lot weaker because Of it."
offmychest,fcj8535,t1_fcj7lpa,1577679684.0,"I’ve already unblocked him sent a bullshit text and blocked him again because I’m weak. But he didn’t respond or anything. 
You’re absolutely right xx"
offmychest,fcj6gdv,t1_fcj63ou,1577678441.0,"It’s like loving Lucifer he shows his real face when ever he desires and it’s so hard because you wanna remember the good only at this point I don’t even know what I love anymore. 

You’re right I have to be careful, I just wanna close this chapter. The feeling I have isn’t real there’s someone out there for everyone and I have to understand. 

Thank you so much"

Xx"
relationship_advice,fcj5rxi,t3_ehgcqa,1577677958.0,"I know and it’s harder than it seems but I think we’re done for good. He ended it with me and blamed me for everything. 

Which is fine he’s a narcissist. I didn’t expect less"
relationship_advice,fcj5ozk,t3_ehgcqa,1577677902.0,I’ve thought about that. His family literally will cover it up at this rate it seems like they will do anything to protect him.
offmychest,fcj58lw,t1_fcj537w,1577677583.0,"I am so sorry you went through it too. I’ve been going through it for so long now and I feel like I almost attract this bullshit to my life.  
I just wanted to fall in love get married settle down. That’s it I wish it were that easy I think life has a way of always making obstacles. I just wanted the chance to say it’s done with if he doesn’t apologize and I never got it. 

Thank you xx"
offmychest,fcj537j,t1_fcj4c4w,1577677478.0,"This was a great response thank you. I needed that he actually is going to a behavior interventionist for his anger issues and it’s clearly not helping. I definitely have thought of pressing charges. In fact we already went to court already because someone called the cops on him he shattered my phone in July and beat me in a parking lot in the car. I told the court dogs bit me. It was that bad. 


that’s what I said too it’s normal when couples fight but not to the point where you get physical. I’m just so upset cause he said we’re over & I literally begged him to apologize I just said please just say sorry for hitting me. He doesn’t realize what he does he goes from
I’m so in love with you to I hate you to I’m gonna hit you and pretend in front of everyone it never happened. 

Basically I’m a fool :( thank you so much for these solutions you’re so right about apologizing."
relationship_advice,fcj49s9,t1_fcj41ec,1577676903.0,I know I’m in therapy now. It all goes down to my abuse has a child. That’s why I’m holding on and it’s screwed up.
