xxfitness,ffubxqm,t1_ffubtoe,1580238747.0,I have a non-body fat one that I had been using for years. I’m going to switch back and just use it for  trend analysis.
xxfitness,ffua29b,t1_ffu8ttj,1580237634.0,I appreciate the feedback.
xxfitness,ffu9x5i,t1_ffu4d38,1580237551.0,Thank you! I am officially returning the scale lol.
xxfitness,ffu9trd,t1_ffu6s2r,1580237497.0,I’ve been strength training for about a year and tried different diets throughout. I was eating 1650 flat for a couple months but was worried I may not be eating enough for muscle gain despite having high protein. I got the scale the same time I upped calories on workout days in an attempt to track muscle gain/fat loss. I definitely feel better eating more (but don’t we all lol).

investing,fekfa9n,t1_fekf1ac,1579198830.0,"I’m shooting for FIRE (by age 50-55 or so) but have no idea if that’s possible. Can you recommend a good calculator?

My 401K and Roth IRA are in a 2055 target date fund (to have a higher stock balanc) but I’d like to retire earlier if possible. Age 50 is in 23 years so I figured it didn’t matter too much now."
investing,fekbhp2,t3_epihr7,1579196576.0,"Hi all, I just opened my first brokerage account with Vanguard and have some questions. I have no debts and am already maxing out Roth IRA, 401k, and HSA. I have 55K in liquid saving and am planning on moving it all to the brokerage account except for a 15K emergency fund. My goal is to save for retirement (buy and hold). I am 27 and have low living expenses.

1. I transferred 10K out of the 55K savings account to the new brokerage account to start. I used the Taylor Larimore three-fund lazy portfolio (27% BND, 20% VSUX, 53% VTI). Does this portfolio look right for my goals?
2. Since I have 10K in the brokerage account, I think I'm eligible for Vanguard Admiral Shares. The fees are slightly higher than the ETFs I invested in though. What is the advantage to using Admiral Shares?
3. When I transfer the remaining 30K from my savings to the brokerage account, will it automatically distribute using the portfolio distribution, or do I need to go back and buy shares?

I am new to investing so apologies if any of this is dumb/doesn't make sense. Thanks!"

Also, did she actually turn down the larger settlement???"
TwoXChromosomes,fdwy97f,t1_fdu9yc6,1578763456.0,"I’m 27 and never wanted kids, and agree with you on the feeling getting stronger. The more I learn about pregnancy, what motherhood is actually like, and how fucked the future world will be doesn’t help."

cats,fdsccfx,t1_fds7ls5,1578699365.0,Yes!
VoteBlue,fdmjuj5,t1_fdkwjyb,1578552566.0,I’m in Kansas and I’m voting for her. I’ve been nagging my unregistered friends for over a year already— got one so far!
