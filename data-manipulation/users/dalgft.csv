childfree,fgo1qd5,t3_ezlbh8,1580957764.0,"I can relate to this because my (now) ex-girlfriend of 2 years came out to me one day that she was open about having kids and exploring the possibilities. I don't think she really understood how important it was to me to stay childfree. 

When her and I hooked up she never expressed wanting kids and I *thought* we were on the same page, but it was a crushing thing because I knew I had to break with her immediately. Yes, it's *that* important. Just imagining a situation where she would tell me ""I'm pregnant"" literally made me sick. I felt so trapped in that relationship and depressed. 

That was my experience and my life has been a hell of a lot better since. I don't feel the enormous weight of that situation hanging over me anymore."

The GFCI is designed to protect personnel against electrocution while operating tools or equipment on a GFCI protected circuit. It is designed to interrupt and de-energize the circuit if there is an imbalance in current of 6 mA or greater between the line conductors (NEC 100IN). The GFCI is resettable. The AFCI is resettable and designed to interrupt and de-energize a circuit to protect life and property should anomalies that mimic arcing faults occur in an AFCI protected circuit.""*

*""According to Siemens, a supplier of combination-type arc-fault interrupter circuit breakers, “Combination Type Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCI) detects arcing faults (an unintentional arcing condition in a circuit) that standard circuit breakers are unable to detect. The device is intended to mitigate the effects of arcing faults by functioning to de-energize the circuit when an arc-fault is detected. A Combination Type AFCI detects all three types of arcing: line-to-neutral, line-to-ground, and series arcing.”""*

Changing ones' diet helps immensely- some say the gut is body's second brain. Meditation, early on in the day, can help one find their center and visualization of overcoming adversity.
