insaneparents,ffh0fyt,t1_ffglfk5,1579919786.0,He went to prison for those lies. He was paid to make those “studies” say what they said. Then somehow Jenny McCarthy’s dumbass got a following and ideas and the shit show went from there....

AmItheAsshole,fffm223,t3_etddwo,1579886880.0,"This situation sucks. However, idk where you’re from, but most places offer the option to continue the insurance and he can pay for it, though it’s quite costly. However, with her being ill, and him being laid off, would this maybe be a blessing in disguise for him? Would he then be able to get temporary government assistance to cover her medical bills and stuff? This is a terrible situation for you. I would put it on paper in front of you tbh. Also, if you keep him, and the performance falls, is your job then in jeopardy?"

He should realize that as a grown up he will be faced with many situations that will provide a natural consequence like this.
