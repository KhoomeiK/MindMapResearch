It's a cascading effect. As electric cars become more affordable, they become more common. Then gas stations start seeing fewer customers. Some of them start closing. Now getting gas is a little less convenient. This pushes some more people to switch to electric. The used car market starts to go more electric. Used gasoline vehicles values drop. More people buy electric now because they hold their value better over time and it becomes the better investment. Then the whole cycle *really* compounds itself pretty quickly. This is all not to mention if/when fuel prices rise.

BobsTavern,ffadp94,t3_es9xki,1579733137.0,"Just think about it more. There's no silver bullet. Some examples are like if you're cobalt build, open with cobalts. Don't have a shield popper because 1) demons don't have shields and 2) having more bodies on the board mean more things to soak up juggles. So like even a spawn of n'zoth shouldn't be the opener unless you've got a 3 HP minion you need to put out of range.

HP is better to buff than attack. A lot of mech boards I see have tons of attack but very little HP and they die to exactly what is supposed to counter them. No problem there.

Sniping is a thing. Cleave or Zapp or lucky kaboom bots can work great. 

another strategy could be to have all of your low attack minions go first, so that you don't kill their demons off for several hits, resulting in their jugglers attacking and dying before all their demons die (I've not actually used this strategy but I can see situations where it might be viable, depending on compositions).

Also don't go murlocs unless they fall into your lap. Like if you've already got Brann and are T5 and get offered a couple nice murlocs then maybe make the switch if you're not super strong yet, but it's always a super risky idea to start building a board that NEEDS to find Brann to work.

So just to *break even* with other players he has to buy at least 1 minion per turn and not float any gold and not re-roll ever. 

His theoretical advantage is in the late game buffing his minions because to buy, use, sell a battlecry for him is 1/2 price of everyone else (net cost of 1 vs net cost of 2)"

Don't be surprised - adding more people doesn't increase the possibility of a task. If the population increased hundred-fold over night, nobody would be able to do a 12 foot high jump"

lol the only way that could happen is if Mal'Ganis dies first, following by 1 damage to Gang Boss, followed by the 2/2 dying, 1 damage to Gang Boss, 2/2 dying, repeat until gang boss and all tokens are dead, meanwhile no voidlords or soul jugglers have died, THEN a voidlord dies followed by at least 2 voidwalkers before the other voidlord dies, while jugglers still all survive.

And even in this scenario it would be 21 demons and even that is impossible since there's no board that could kill things in that order lol."

Of course the various effects of poverty are going to correlate with each other!
