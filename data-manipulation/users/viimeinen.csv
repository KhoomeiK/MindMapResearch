ProgrammerHumor,ff4lrhx,t1_ff48jmg,1579566686.0,"There are still 3 levels for me to be promoted to at my company while avoiding management. The first one is almost automatic based on seniority, so I am not even close to the top of the range. 

Other friends are regulated by IG Metall so they are a bit more constrained, but do have *some* room. 
Others literally just started a few months ago and are expecting a raise at the end of the probezeit and promotions later on. 

Besides you said 80k was average, 100k was top, I argued you are ~20% short. How does my example of people earning up to 130k corroborate your statement?"

ProgrammerHumor,ff3peos,t1_ff3cbcj,1579546002.0,"Well, I know my salary and those of 4 friends. We are all in our mid 30s with 10 to 15 years of experience, and MSc graduates. Our salaries are in the 80-130k range, the 80k is in Berlin (kind of finance related) the rest in Munich (none in finance). None of us is even a manager; *we are on* senior dev or architect level. We work in companies from 30 to tens of thousands of employees. 

*EDIT: added for disambiguation*

Either we are a bunch of geniuses or your estimates are slightly low. None of us is remotely famous, we don't have a stellar github or a portfolio of famous open source gems. 

I don't doubt a recent grad churning yet another Java CRM is closer to 60k, but once you get some experience the salaries grow quite well. The top end is nowhere near 80k.

I very much doubt VPs earn 120-150k, although I don't have any data to base it on."
ProgrammerHumor,ff3991n,t1_ff2z01r,1579536685.0,"Your data regarding Germany is a bit pessimistic. At least in Munich (sure, it's THE most expensive to live in) salaries can be notably higher, at least 20% I'd say."

ExperiencedDevs,feof4dz,t3_eq0tgk,1579299259.0,"I am in my mid thirties and I would definitely would go into IT again. I started rather early, before even college, and have been in startups, academia, freelancing and big corporations. Helpdesk, pure dev, consulting, lower management and even sales. A bit of everything. The field is so wide (and deep) that it's very easy finding some role and company you love. 

My last job interview was a couple of basic technical questions of the kind ""what is a REST API"", and then 55 minutes of discussing previous projects, both professionally and hobby. What I did, how, and why that way. Industry trends. Company culture and direction.

Some roles ask algorithmic questions to see your way of thinking and, let's be honest, your capabilities of jumping though barely-related hoops to get the job. 95% of it is useless in your day to day job the same way as 95% of what you learn at college you don't need. But having that diploma shows you have brains and patience. And you'll be able to learn the Javascript framework du jour no problem. Same way acing the ""reverse a linked list"" question shows dedication, a minimal level of expertise and communication and problem solving skills.

If you show vision, leadership and ability to cooperate, you will go up into ""software engineering"": team lead, product owner, whatever, otherwise you will keep ""coding"" the features in the current sprint. Or you'll switch to management. Or reinstall windows for old ladies..."
