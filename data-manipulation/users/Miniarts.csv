Animemes,ffkrddg,t1_ffjm9ki,1580027540.0,"I will say it was a bit of a Golden time for OVAs. Made for TV stuff was more serialized abs long running, while the shorter series were given big budgets in small batches, and specifically, in a loose timespan. 

No one cared what day in particular the seventh episode of City Hunters out on LaserDisc, because you just buy the series in order and you’re done. What to do until the next one releases? Pick up 8 man or something. Or watch Lupin on broadcast, it doesn’t matter what episode everyone knows Lupin!

With streaming services, we can basically treat every show like an ONA that we pick up and set down at any time, but the studios know the widespread availability bolsters the weekly release formula. Now the “Next time on Dragon Ball Z” can be applied to any slice of life show, knowing we’ve all signed up.

Therefore, the beauty of releasing a product in its perfect final form has lost to the benefits of meeting the minimum to maximize profits. 

Anime studios often only have a few weeks to fully produce an episode from storyboards to final for TV, compared to the lax schedule for OVA
