Plus I don't want to bum my parents out. Sure, they are the idiots that put me in this shithole to begin with. But they were just to ignorant at the time to understand the reprocussions of that action. Plus I don't believe in free will or placing blame, so I can't tell myself they deserve to deal with their son's suicide, and I love them enough not to want them going through that level of suffering.

How in the world does Iraq invading Iran in 1980 make Iran one of the worst global evils?
You fail to take into account the events that preceeded that invasion. I'm not saying Iraq was innocent in all this. But neither was Iran.

I am not saying the united states is without blame. I have no illusions regarding it's selfish imperialistic nature. That being said, Iran is currently a religious, mysogonistic, homophobic nation, where you are not even allowed to speak against the regime. If I had to pick a side between to evil empires, I'd rather the see the one where free speech is permited win. In my eyes that makes the united states the lesser evil."

They fund Huzbollah which operates as Iran's proxy, inforcing their adgenda in Lebanon and Syria as well as attack Israel. Furthermore it is a religious conservative country and as result women rights are few in Iran, and homosexuality is punishable by death.

As for North Korea. While it is true that they mostly keep to themselves, they are extremely cruel to their own citizens. It is illegal in both Iran and North Korea to criticize the regime. Those who oppose are sent to reducation camps."

Not saying those contries are great either. I myself am from Israel, and don't really like it here all that much. 

But this whole thing reminds me of the time before WWII. The germans were constantly violating the Versai accords, and the allied powers just did nothing, hoping the Germans would eventually calmed down if they got their way for a while, because the allies didn't want another war. And we all know how well that turned out.

The problem with letting bullies get their way, is that you are essentially rewarding their hostilities. The best way to stop this type of behavior is to nip it in the bud, before it escalates into something much worst like back in WWII."

TheLastAirbender,fctuzwv,t1_fctbj0x,1577960930.0,"I hear you but I respectfully disagree. 

I think there is an objective reality, even if we cannot percieve it. I think your grandfather did exist even if no one remembers. I think we are seperate observers, connected by unbreakable threads.

I am familiar with the philosophy of which you speak, and my problem with it remains. Where is the evidence? Or instead, what logical argument can you provide to back up these claims?

If your ego death is all you have then I assume you can understand why I can't accept it as compeling evidence.

I too experienced ego death on acid several times, but my experience was slightly different. While I did experience that I was connected to everything, I still felt that I was a unique perspective. I felt that while the content of my thoughts and perceptions may be illusions, the fact that there is a self is true. As Decartes said I think therefore I am. 

Perhaps I am not a human. Perhaps I am a brain in a jar. Perhaps I am an alien or an entity who is playing a game. But I am something.

You say that the mind is an illusion, but that is a paradox. An illusion is a distortion of mental perception. Which means there must be a mind to percieve it, and be mislead by it. If you define the mind as an illusion then you define an infinite recursion, because then you define the mind by itself. It's paradoxical. It's absurd. 

And even if our minds are a part of the same whole, there still exists some seperation between us. The perspective I'm in is infinitly seperated from yours. You cannot precieve my thoughts directly, nor I yours. In that respect, all is not one."

TheLastAirbender,fcqbh6j,t1_fcq9y8t,1577882720.0,"What is the illusion? The content of my subjective experience, or there being an observer to the subjective experience?
The word illusion implies there is someone being deluded by false information.

 You say that we are the same obsever. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Perhaps we are two different observers in the same universe. You say you experienced that we are not seperate beings in your ego death. Maybe that was an illusion. How can you tell?

And even if I agreed with your perception that we are in fact the same entity, the fact that ""I"" the entity currently experiences two seperate illusions means that not all is one. The illusions themselves are seperated. Perhaps by space and time. Perhaps by something else. But either way some kind of seperation exists. A seperation between one perspective and the other.

That being said, upon retrospect I don't find these sensetions to be compeling evidence. Even if everytime I took acid I had similar sensetions, which I did not, it would still not count twords repeatable evidence that oneness is indeed true and seperation is an illusion. It's possible that oneness is an illusion, consistently brought on by certain brain patterns.

It's like how every time I get shit faced drunk I get dizzy and the room starts spinning. Does that mean that the room is always spining reletive to me, and that what I usually percieve is an illusion? Or perhaps it's simply the alcohol causing my brain to precieve the room as spining, and the room is in fact stationary relitive to me.
