ELC AMX: small, agile and big alpha. Leads to two different light tank lines. Both are worth it. 

French wheels: very much worth it. They're the truest form of light tank. 

Chaffee: probably the most balanced tier 5 light. It'll lead to meh/bad high tier light tanks though. 

P.43 bis: lovely gun, bad aim time and large bloom but makes up for it with it's fantastic alpha and good pen, accuracy and dpm. It is on the slower side. Sadly I have not found the armour to be even half-reliable. It'll bounce as much as any other tier 6 medium. Good tech tree line overall too.
