Parenting,ffhkxjd,t3_etktfu,1579940093.0,The awareness is what’s changed. Society blinds us. The world is full of suffering and it’s not headed to a happy place. Why would we want this for future generations?
Parenting,ffhk72c,t1_ffhjmvs,1579939043.0,"I’m not denying your skills as a mother, but why else do we have kids? We are already over populated with tons of them in the system. Having a child to make you feel whole is selfish. Only you can do that. Putting expectations on a child like that will only fuck them up in the long run. Trust me. My mother had us for the wrong reasons. We couldn’t fulfill her after all, so we were emotionally neglected."
Parenting,ffhjpnh,t3_etktfu,1579938380.0,"I’m not denying that, but bringing children into this world is totally selfish. Why else would you have a child? For security or unconditional love. This world is turning to shit so quick and the amount of suffering people endure, and don’t get me started on society illusions."
Anxiety,ffhinl1,t1_ffhij72,1579936971.0,"I have and I always end up here. I’m just so tired of suffering. I don’t know why I’m even venting on here. I think mainly because I’m tired of putting my family and friends through this. It’s been years of constant anxiety attacks, constant illness and I think I know what I have to do to end my suffering."

Parenting,ffhh8fu,t3_etktfu,1579935131.0,Why would anyone bring a child into this world other than selfish reasons?
