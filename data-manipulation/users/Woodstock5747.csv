Unfortunately ive had incidences like yours in the past too. I had a female boss who we had to be very careful around when we spoke. It was pretty bad and we always felt like we had to step on eggshells if we said anything other then positive and empowering statements about women at work when she was around.

I had a second female boss call an ""emergency meeting"" within minutes of meeting me when I started a new job. She was giving me the run down for a job I'd already been trained in and at the end of it she told me to do a lot of stuff. I replied ""ok, I'll get it done"". The meeting which really was just around the corner of everyone else was scolding me for my attitude and that she didnt like me saying ok to her because she felt i wasnt taking her seriously. She continued by saying that I was there to impress her with what a good worker I am and im not impressing her. When she left, she said goodbye to everyone else in the area by name except me and then called the regional manager (I was the regional vacation manager at this time and had transfered from another location) to tell him he needs to fire me. The accusations and phone calls cussing me out with no warning from her kept coming for months until I called the regional manager and said we need to do something about the breakdown in communication between her and I. He was a bit reluctant but ultimately agreed because I wasnt the first manager that she did this to.

I had a third female boss who actively violated federal law to try and manipulate me into compliance and when she found out I went to HR for advice on interacting with her, she fired me for inappropriately using company resources. It backfired on her though, i kept records of everything and left them with HR. 

The records were pretty intensive, she told me my contract was no longer a 9 month contract but is now a 2 year contract. Actively clapped her syllables at me. Told me i am not allowed to apply for other jobs and she will block any transfer. Accused me of changing corporate business policies at a fortune 500, denied my final paycheck because she felt i didnt do enough to earn that pay, among many other things with a lot of these backed up through emails between her and I. After I left all this documentation with the HR department, they asked if I wanted to fight for my job back and I told them i dont if i have to work for her."

We are very quick to blame men for problems even when they are not the ones responsible for or even involved in an event. it's become such a commonplace that people accept it and propel narratives that dont hold up or make sense without giving the other person a chance to be involved.

Now, ive read, and even done it myself, that a lot of men are overly cautious of the things they say and do, especially when they are around women so they dont become a target for frivulous, fictitious or over exaggerated claims.

Also, i've seen and heard claims of people not even knowing how to interact with others normally anymore because they feel like theyre always being told they're wrong. Its pretty abusive, mentally and emotionally abusive that is and it hurts guys a lot. Women are pretty bad about this and it sickens me when i see the extent that women will emotionally abuse guys in relationships or that like them and think that the more damage they can inflict on a guy, the more that guy cares about them."

If you dont have the answer, your response is appropriate. If she has the information but chooses not to read it, its her problem but it gives you the capability to say yes maam, its in the report i sent you.

I woud suggest just saying something stupid and start with yes like ""yes, that is an option but we would have to look into it"". She may be insecure and see not having an answer immediately as not taking her seriously or she may be looking for more commitment from you.

I always say ""yes, ill take a note of that"" or something a long that line when someone asks me something stupid on the spot. Just make sure you say youll get back to her in such and such time with an update and then actually follow through. Actions speak louder then words in these situations.

IMO, managers that act like this are just out for control and really dont care what youre doing as long as youre listening to them. Just give them what they want and if it gets bad enough, talk to HR about how to navigate these situations. They are meant to offer advice on this stuff too and if things do escalate, itll be good to have the rapport with them."
jobs,ffgnkib,t1_fffkxx9,1579910409.0,"No sir, but the shear frustration you bring to this in your words is reflective of a lot. I never put blame but suggested a viewpoint for thoughtful consideration. 

Most companies pay pretty good for career jobs that people have to work for and unfortunately, I know people that make 40, 50, and even 100k+ a year that can't live off it because they never learned financial maturity and always want to spend frivulously like they're a baller, eat out every night and buy the latest and greatest things. For these people, I dont have sympathy for them. I also don't have sympathy for people that just blame everyone else for their problems instead of learning from others and coming up with your own goals for success and trying to grow. As a former manager, I could always work with people who tried and failed. I couldn't work with arrogance and disrespect.

The truth is, you've side tracked my response to the OP that he should be fine with a short unemployment gap because he's already proven himself capable and that gaps of unemployment mostly affect those early in their professional career because this gives a poor signal to people they don't know and this can cause troubles in finding meaningful and gainful employment for entry level career seekers.

You've derailed basic advice into a hateful side argument. I get it, life's not fair but you still need to better yourself and make yourself worth more if you want more. Whether it's in work, money, love, friendships, or whatever, you gotta bring things to the table. Life isn't a romcom or disney movie; great, amazing and awesome things don't just happen because you want them to, especially when other people are included.

By the way, it's your own fault for not looking into a company past what the interview is. That's just stupid and even ignorant.

IWantToLearn,ff5jbiy,t3_err1z7,1579595547.0,"I used to teach martial arts and theres something I want to point out first. Going in, be humble about yourself and your expectations and viewing yourself as ""just a small weak woman"", even at the start, should be seen as ""just a woman"" or, even better, ""you're there to learn"". The frailer you see yourself, the more you'll limit yourself and the less you'll invest in the training.... With proper technique and form women can kick butt. Im not afraid to say in Jiu Jitsu, not the art i taught in, I got my butt kicked by a 90 pound girl in her teens and im a 250 pound guy who trained for a long time before i met her. Size doesnt have much to do with capability when you believe in yourself and even less so when you learn to handle yourself through technique. I also saw the people that saw themselves as weak or frail try and limit others because they felt intimidated or that rules should be changed to make them feel more empowered during sparring but those people normally weeded themselves out after a year, even with coaching because they were holding themselves back or always trying to win by being clever instead of growth and knowledge or they would always blame someone else for their failures.

With that said, Muay Thai is a vicious fighting sport, I trained that for a long time and did fight coaching, it's fun, fast pace but you're going to take a hit and that's ok. Song Moo Kwan is a good art, Hapkido, or any Tae Kwon Do really is good if the instructors are invested. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu too is good for practicality. Its not really striking but good for when people grab you plus you'll learn a lot about defending yourself. 

Be careful when looking at gyms though, someone said Purple belt for masters, this is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu thing. Not all martial arts have the same ranking structure, in BJJ a teacher is purple belt, in Tae Kwon Do, a master is normally 5th degree black belt or higher though. If you look at schools outside BJJ, look for schools taught by black belts and look into their lineage. I'd recommend gyms with a strong verifiable lineage and black belt higher then 5th degree. Anyone can buy a black belt online and make themselves a master so do your work. Also, if a gym says they train ""MMA"", ask what disciplines. Some gyms train Jiu Jitsu and then have some sort of weak striking program, or even is just a mix and match of random techniques that's really nothing.

One thing I would look at, and this is a rare one among gyms, is ask how much they interact with other academies too. Some gyms operate as you have one master and one master only, you will only learn from that one master. While my gym, we operated as a network and it made learning a lot of fun. The core of what we learned was Muay Thai but we interacted with people all over the world from heavy weight kickboxers, welter weight world champions, UFC coaches, Okinawan weapon fighter to grand masters. We took everything we could and adapted things relevant to our style. It's a longer training route but it just also kept things fresh and interesting learning from such a broad range of topics and I felt more comfortable defending myself in a wider range of situations. Plus the people we met were just awesome!"

jobs,fdjnuxw,t1_fdiwxjj,1578480016.0,"I wouldnt sweat the small stuff. Nothing happened and a boss asking questions is what they're supposed to do. Most likely they just wanted to make sure you weren't doing something you weren't supposed to be doing, which is the managers job if they hear something that doesnt sound right. Its noy necessarily a bad thing and honestly probably wont be an issue unless you make it into an issue at this point."

Anyways, theyre pretty much a 100 percent guarantee for a job. The upcoming generation would rather work office jobs at a lower pay then do a tradeskill that requires physical effort."

MechanicalEngineering,fc96v39,t1_fc7k2jt,1577547969.0,"True ME classes might be a bit difficult unless your comfortable with college math.

If you wanna get a jump start, just start googling how things work. Learn concepts and applications. Learn things like how an engine works and why. ME isn't just building something, it is heavy in theory and math and just getting exposed to different systems and building things will help you be more comfortable with it in the college level.

Its hard to recommend online stuff without knowing what your level of math is but at 14 I'd recommend having fun and go to science camps, science museums, etc. Pay attention in school and learn why things do what they do. Everything you learn has a reason ""why"" and more behind it.

Talk to your guidance counselor and teachers. Look at clubs in your high school too."
