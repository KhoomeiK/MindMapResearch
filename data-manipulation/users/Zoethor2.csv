Take her to the vet - they may suggest a grooming session or just a buzz cut to start over on her fur.

AskReddit,fdig4gl,t3_elgpmo,1578442134.0,I'm surprised that the rest of you aren't getting the PHQ-9 stuck in front of you every time you walk into a doctor's office! I get one from my PCP at my annual checkup and my obgyn at my annual visit there and intermittently at my other doctors' appointments as well. It's a basic depression screener and from talking to my medical professional friends they all use it a lot too.
washingtondc,fdfdynn,t1_fdew8om,1578359450.0,"I bought an immersion blender, the best rated one I could find on Amazon, and I ultimately wound up buying a real blender less than six months later. You just cannot get the same super-smooth soup consistency with an immersion blender, in my experience. Alternately, you can buy a chinois and run your soup through it, but doing that once was enough for me to decide to just splurge on a blender, my arms were so tired."
washingtondc,fdfdtfa,t1_fdecfkp,1578359352.0,"Two suggested modifications to the recipe - add a splash of fish sauce or black garlic umami sauce (both in the Asian section at the grocery store) - either one will just lift it up that extra notch to really taste restaurant quality.

Second suggestion, if your friend likes a really creamy butternut squash soup, add either a can of coconut milk, a generous scoop of yogurt, or a generous scoop of sour cream. All of these make for a very rich, creamy soup."

Frugal,fdcn1ik,t3_ekghnf,1578278975.0,How'd you get that awesome texture on the sweet potato? I have a massive quantity of sweet potato from my veggie delivery but it always comes out super dry and dense when I try to oven roast it.
BravoTopChef,fdcettm,t1_fc4msye,1578273158.0,"""IT'S A COINCIDENCE"" oh my gosh. I never watch the reunions I had no idea I was missing out on this hilarity."
AskReddit,fdc7slk,t1_fd7l27h,1578268776.0,"My cats REFUSE to eat the whitefish and cheese Friskies (they don't normally get Friskies, but I was trying to tempt a sick cat to eat). They just turn their little noses up and leave it on the plate. Is it possible I've raised snotty foodie cats?"
IAmA,fdbm1ju,t1_fdathal,1578258707.0,"You should read this article about a medication error (facilitated by the EMR) that resulted in a 38x dose given to a patient. The combination of factors that led to the error is fascinating but like you, I think the most astounding thing is that final nurse who opened 38 separate packages of medication and gave them to the patient and, while skeptical, proceeded with it.

AmItheAsshole,fdbapz0,t1_fd9dxp7,1578255581.0,"Seriously. My friends have twin girls who are almost 3 years old... one of the girls had some potty training regression recently and was deliberately pooping on the floor instead of in the toilet. Poop. On the floor. OP is going to need to learn to be more flexible, really fast, if he's going to survive a small child in his life."
survivor,fd58cr1,t1_fd078qk,1578175146.0,"Honestly, because the percentage of viewers who care is very, very small and it's just not worth it. Plus it's not exactly super rewatchable content.

I mean, back of the envelope - let's take everyone who follows Probst on twitter plus the number of subscribers to this sub, call those the superfans, that's about 500K people. Let's assume half of those people really, really, really like the intro and would watch it on YouTube (likely an overestimate if anything). So 250K. Looking at season 39 viewership, Survivor pulls in 6M+ viewers an episode. So we're talking less than 5% of viewers, probably, that reallllllly want this content. And it's not like those people are going to stop watching the show over the issue."
survivor,fd56p3p,t1_fd2dbvw,1578174734.0,"Yeah, I've been rewatching all the season 40 relevant seasons and I fast forward right through rites of passage, it's super dull to me.

But I also don't give any sort of a crap whether they produce the main title intro or not."
survivor,fd4x7lk,t1_fd3tff3,1578171946.0,"There is a major difference in meaning between ""it is too expensive"" and ""the expense can't be justified"". It could cost them $100 to make and still not be justified."
Pets,fd0civf,t1_fd0be81,1578116883.0,"That's certainly a possibility, but given the cat's history as a stray, it may also just be excessively food focused. I've taken in a few stray/kinda-feral cats and there was a not insignificant period where they were getting more than sufficient maintenance-to-gain-weight calories each day and they were still SUPER obsessed with food. One of mine still scarfs her food like someone is going to steal it, to the degree that I serve all dry food via a puzzle feeder to slow her down so she doesn't puke everywhere, and she's been indoors and fully fed for 12 years now."

My tiny petite girl is 7lbs and also completely healthy at that weight. She's just a wee little cat."
