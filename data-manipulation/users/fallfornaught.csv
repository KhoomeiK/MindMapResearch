ComedyCemetery,ff76q8x,t1_ff5l1lg,1579642209.0,"Okay besides that being a completely ridiculous generalization is that really what you think that comic is about? Please answer honestly I’m not trying to insult your intelligence I’m just trying to see if you really understand what it’s about and are just trying to play it off, or if that’s what you really think"
ComedyCemetery,ff4mvtq,t1_ff3mzpa,1579567472.0,So aside from none of those being funny could you go ahead and explain the third one to me? I’m especially curious about the name of the comic and the color of the gentleman in the last panel? Please and thank you!

You’re the one defending a nazi and calling people “hoes”. Well I’d say you’re defending but you refuse to because you know you’re wrong. 

I hope one day you grow up and no longer have whatever hatred for marginalized groups you currently have in your heart. Good luck"
ComedyCemetery,ff3irj2,t1_ff3bix5,1579541921.0,Please show me at least one comic that is hilarious and then I want you to explain to me why it’s hilarious without sounding like an intolerant and insufferable piece of shit waste of human space. Please accept my challenge. I’m eager to see

CFB,fcujlut,t1_fctyc2n,1577982488.0,"Yes. I agree 100%. Which is why it’s a frustrating excuse to hear. Georgia got beat hard last year.  This year they beat Baylor hard. No excuses either way.  Good for y’all, honestly, there’s just plenty this past year on here who have made the excuse over and over again so it’s just super annoying"

I’m just real sick of the hypocrisy. Plenty of Georgia fans admitted they lost and it’s all good. But there’s so many that made so many excuses for this whole year and they’re not making any now, I just find that real dumb and annoying"

CFB,fcpiqd5,t1_fcph21m,1577865331.0,"The easiest reply I have is this. Go to winspedia and sort by all time averages. There’s eight programs head and shoulders above the rest in terms of a bunch of categories over the pst 150 years. Yes it’s been a while since Texas has won a natty, but it’s more recent than OU, USC, Michigan, Nebraska, and Notre Dame. Those are all blue bloods. In fact the only blue bloods with championships more recent than Texas are the only two left: Ohio State and Alabama"
CFB,fcp6ovq,t1_fcp5qvl,1577852263.0,You’re on the money. But it’ll take a long time for either UT or USC to lose blue blood status. So yeah USC isn’t on the “right” path (who knows if UT is) but they’ll be fine
