SuicideWatch,ffkw3uo,t1_ffjgkjq,1580030069.0,"Same for me,  4th grade until now. Not 7 years old but still pretty young. Kids can really change a perfectly happy kid real fast."
teenagers,ffkufmy,t1_ffhtta3,1580029090.0,"Exactly, I’d totally be addicted to it if they just started over for seasons 1-7 :("
teenagers,ffhp3fa,t1_ffh2zy6,1579946355.0,"Nah, played it for the first time in forever with my friend the other night and it amazed us how they took out EVERYTHING that made it bearable. Now it’s just a shit hole of sweats. Playerbase and game bad."
SuicideWatch,fferwew,t1_fferpmi,1579862543.0,"I’ve tried, there really is no reason to stay for me. I like my dog but he won’t notice when I’m gone since I have a big family."
SuicideWatch,ffere4r,t1_ffer390,1579861779.0,"You’re right. My other option was to hire a hitman since I have $5000 and the dark web, although I feel as if it’d cost even more. I’d get another $5000 by July if that’s the case."
SuicideWatch,ffeqyni,t1_ffeqmu1,1579861141.0,I’m guessing I have to wait until I get my license then? 6 months isn’t the worst
SuicideWatch,ffeqx8p,t1_ffeqo8y,1579861087.0,"It’s just a never ending cycle of the same things. There’s no point in staying alive, it’s not like I’d actually be living if I’d just feel like this. Either way we all die at some point, I just want to do it now. Heaven sounds better than this corrupt place."
feemagers,ffeqe9f,t1_ffeq8h6,1579860302.0,Wasn’t comfortable with the idea of telling her stuff about my body. Ig i wasn’t as close with her as my other sisters were
feemagers,ffeq619,t1_ffepthu,1579859957.0,"I live in Michigan, I don’t know how to even deal with a desert. Basically went over a dune to leak and i pulled down my shorts to see a murder scene. What happens in New Mexico, stays in New Mexico. Basically had to wait until we drove back to the hotel. Was too embarrassed to tell my mom. Luckily I have 2 sisters so I stole tampons and had to learn how to deal with tampons for the first time by myself. Lowkey sucked ass."
