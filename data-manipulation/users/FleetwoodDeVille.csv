Sure, but they also resorted to an additional indignity, that of engaging in sexual relations that go against their normal predilection.

I can't prove to you that I am experiencing anything any more than you can prove to me that you are experiencing anything.  

So say I want to verify if my perceptions match reality.  I'm seeing a pink elephant in the room and my experience tells me that might be a hallucination.  I could ask my friend Bob if he sees a pink elephant as well, but then I have to remember that I've never had any proof that Bob is actually a conscious observer of an objective reality who could confirm or dispute my perceptions.  I've just assumed that is the case because it's convenient, and because it makes my life a lot less lonely to assume Bob is real.

Certainly, since the trend started before crack cocaine even existed, I think we can safely rule that out as the root cause.

While the incarceration rate of blacks has historically been higher than whites, there was actually a small drop in black incarceration rates during the 1960s, and it wasn't until just before the 1980s that the disparity between black and white incarceration rates began to grow significantly beyond the historical average.

We don't actually KNOW that though, and I maintain that it's impossible for us to actually demonstrate that.  It's just a conceit that we agree to because if we don't agree to it then we can't go any further.  Which is fine.
