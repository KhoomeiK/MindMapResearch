""Cheating"" is tossed around a lot in our market between spygate/deflategate, but true fans of the NFL who don't just hate the Patriots for the sake of hating recognize how overblown those situations were and how many other teams are doing similar things. 

This is different. This is coordinated, pre-meditated, and repeated for years and on two teams. They need to move on from this and reset. This has the chance to deter some players future interest in joining us, it would be a massive distraction in the clubhouse and from the media, and fans, such as myself, would always have it on my mind while watching if he is there. 

This sucks."
redsox,febchtk,t1_feahggu,1578957471.0,"Especially those who care deeply about the integrity of the game... which are often times some of the best players. Cheating like this is a huge stain, think of what happened to the Black Sox and Pete Rose... not comparing apples to apples, but there's always a stigma around anyone who touches full-blown cheating. 

It sucks, I really like Cora, I like his style and his media presence. I think the players love playing for him. But, being a fan of the game and overall integrity, he has to go IMO."
redsox,feah8gf,t1_feaeimm,1578948693.0,"No problem, I'll start by saying I'm a die-hard fan of the team and the sport, but by no means an expert in management or public relations. 

This is a really bad look, Cora was said to be the mastermind of the cheating in Houston and then was doing the same thing once he got to Boston- both of those teams won world series. Cora will be suspended for at least 1 year, possibly more, and by keeping him the stench of the whole thing will weigh down the clubhouse, future signings, and extensions, media coverage, etc. Houston coming out and firing Hinch within an hour has also set precedence and the Sox/Henry would look dirty, IMO. 

Then what? You wait around 1-2 years for Cora to come back and just throw him back as Manager with the stain around him? There is also a chance Cora is banned for life (...I said chance, who knows). They need to get away from this for the fan base, for the players, and for their future."
redsox,feadd2h,t1_feac233,1578947254.0,"I hate to say it because I like him as a manager, but he has to get fired, you need to distance yourself from this.

One of the cool moments with him was when the Bruins retired #7 in the rafters, Bourque had been wearing it and they didn't tell Esposito what was going on pregame, Bourque skated up and took off his #7 jersey to expose #77 and said it was his and never should have been anybody else's."

My rationale being Tatum/Brown often go 1v1 and the ball seems to get held for a ways into the shot clock, even Kemba is only averaging 5 assists a game as your PG. Smart moves the ball pretty well and adds a defensive element right from the start.
