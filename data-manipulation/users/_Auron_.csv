NintendoSwitch,fds9ehf,t1_fdqjecv,1578697382.0,"Wasn't it originally ultra-zoomed in? I had to sell my switch games ~~last year~~ in 2018 and have been rebuilding since, but haven't played it since the year it launched."
NintendoSwitch,fds93c4,t1_fds43iu,1578697178.0,"I tried looking around but aside from requiring password (and/or not saving credit card) every time for eShop purchase or setting a pincode to unlock the Switch console to the home screen, or using Parental Controls smartphone app linked to the console to disable certain ESRB rated games from being launched or the whole console itself during certain hours, you cannot set profile-specific restrictions.

I don't know why, that kind of sucks to be honest. Either I overlooked the option somewhere or Nintendo didn't bother."

Or that new season of your favorite Netflix show that you _have_ to sink time into. Or new video game. Or the other hundreds of distractions we have in our world of consumerism. We're heavily sedated at this point."

I unplug power from HMDs when I'm not using VR now. Way too expensive for it to just randomly fail overnight."
