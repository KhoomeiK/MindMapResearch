My main advice would be go to a parts store (lordco here in BC canada) and ask for a rock guard sprayer. Not the cans but the kind you can hook up to a compressor.  It cost me 17 bucks. Turn the air pressure down as needed (mine was like 25) and spray every thing with paintable rock guard (dont bother with tintable shit its garbage). Its actually painfully easy to get the hang of.  

It may give you a 'rough' look but it hides absolutely every dent ding hole you can imagine lol.  It cone in all sorts and is very good at keeping water out. Plus it's tough. Holds up well to rocks etc. Its also awesome for inside. I sprayed the whole inside of mine and it hid the 10 different colours of bondo so well. Since its water proof it works as a back splash and because there are always tricky corners in RV's it's great to make them look good.
