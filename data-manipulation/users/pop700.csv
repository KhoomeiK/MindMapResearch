Ok."
CapitalismVSocialism,fefbi2g,t1_fefahtc,1579052673.0,Correct. It would come down to service provided. If the customers are satisfied then the service continues otherwise a new service would take over

CapitalismVSocialism,fef961m,t1_fef7rhz,1579051130.0,">If you support the system you are saying you find it sufficient. I know, interpreting things is hard.

Doesn't matter. Thats not what we're debating. Keep up kid.

>Finally, you agree. The system is insufficient and therefore shouldn't be implemented.

Disagree but ok not what we're debating. Keep up kid.

>So there are no taxes and therefore no rights are enforced because government doesn't exist to enforce them. Without enforcement of rights, like property rights, no free market exists. *No market even exists without property, dumbass.* Therefore, libertarianism interferes with the market.

Assumptions. People would volunteer/ donate to maintain their rights. Bam. You're done, kid. 

>k then stop responding if you can't make any argument against me, as you've been unable to make for days now

Its fun watching you make a fool of yourself. And you responses are being loved on Twitter 🤣

Socialist: ""people would work for free in a socialist society""

Also you ""vOluNtEeRinG iSnT sUfFiCiEnT""

>Libertarianism interferes with the free market, see above or any number of responses I've written to you. 

Incorrect. See previous points. Keep up kid 

>Please actually include an argument next time instead of the usual. If you can't make any argument I'll just quote my earlier responses for you until you understand.

Ok."
CapitalismVSocialism,fef7bal,t1_fef5lws,1579049881.0,"Incorrect. The complaint is that Government is interfering with the free market.

Regardless, get to the point so i can correct you."
CapitalismVSocialism,fef6ar1,t3_eot067,1579049198.0,"Freedom is when **Individuals can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't interfere with another individual**

Libertarian Free Market Capitalism is the only system that always for this."
CapitalismVSocialism,fef5e5h,t1_fef4h95,1579048579.0,"No. Government intervention

Way to pay attention 👍"
nihilism,fef4f4e,t3_eou9af,1579047928.0,Ok bye.
CapitalismVSocialism,fef44co,t1_fef2vr0,1579047724.0,Free market decides. Running a radio tower is no cheap task. If you're not making enough to run it then you shutdown and someone else takes over
CapitalismVSocialism,fef3lzf,t1_feezzmf,1579047382.0,">Why not? Can you decide its sufficient but not me? 

Wtf are you talking about kid?! I'm not saying it sufficient or not. Its simply how it is.

Ik its not the answer you wanted but get over it.

>And its not a good system. That's the point. It won't reach enough people.

Ok cool.

>You are a condescending, ignorant person. Funny that you assume what I know. I have a problem with the system, I don't have a problem cause I don't understand the system.

You think you understand the system but you don't. Thats why i had to explain it to you. If you understood it then you would've known there weren't taxes but you didn't.

>Ironic, because you are making no argument. Donations and volunteers don't pick up the slack. That has been proven, among other things, by the need to have literally every western government create social welfare systems.

Lmao you're probably the dumbest person I've debated on here. **We are NOT talking the viability of this system.** We're talking government interference with the free market... did you forget? 

And you're right, there is no argument. Libertarian society doesn't interfere with the free market. Its that simple, there is no argument."
CapitalismVSocialism,feexl2e,t1_feewcwh,1579043414.0,"Lmao thats not how it works. YOU don't get to decide if its ""sufficient"" or not. Donations and volunteers is literally how a Libertarian government works. Not my fault you didn't know that.

You have no argument kid. You lose 🤣"
CapitalismVSocialism,feex6ky,t3_eorwdl,1579043160.0,"Did you know currently in the US the FCC controls the radio spectrum and sells specific frequencies to the highest bidder..?!

This is a good example of government causing monopolies. By only allowing the highest bidders, you restrict the free market of competition leading to a select few having access to the radio spectrum. 

Its bullshit."
CapitalismVSocialism,feew4lz,t1_fedypba,1579042491.0,"**Donations and volunteers is all you need/all you get in a Libertarian society when it comes to government.**

CapitalismVSocialism,fedky3k,t1_fedjvpn,1579014097.0,"Nope. Donations and volunteers is all you need/all you get in a Libertarian society when it comes to government.

Looks like we found the flaw in your assumptions."
CapitalismVSocialism,fedgyjx,t1_fed82mv,1579011246.0,">Literally any require the government to enforce. This, at the least, requires tax money taken from “the market”. Therefore, you can’t have government and a free market. 

Nope. Donations and volunteers.

>No right exists without enforcement and no sufficient mechanism exists within a free market to enforce a right for all. Therefore you need a government if you want a right.

See first answer."
