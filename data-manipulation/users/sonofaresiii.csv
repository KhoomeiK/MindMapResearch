No, of that much I'm certain. So many people already do absolutely love to secure an adoption even from an unborn child, and there are so many waiting that they'd have no problem finding people willing to adopt unborn children.

A couple problems with that:

1) Even though we want that to be true... it usually isn't. The friends will usually back the person telling the story, without considering whether this person's view is actually valid. This helps if the whole group of people is kind of assholish and predisposed to believe retail workers are fuck-ups (a *whole lot of people* assume that)

2) The person telling the story may change details to make themselves sound better. This is suuuuper common. You might not know the person *lies* about their retail interactions (or others), or you might think ""Well even if this person *sometimes* lies, it sounds like they're telling the truth this time!""

When Batman or Iron Man *do* come across someone who genuinely just needs some help, they'll gladly offer it and hope for the best. But most of the time, the criminals are just pieces of shit.

Even if they were to *only* hire the criminals purely to just sit at home and stay out of the hands of the supervillains... most of the criminals would just take their Wayne/Stark paycheck, and go double dip to work for the supervillains anyway.

e: I took this from the point of view of the common thug, but it applies to most of the higher-up mercenaries too. Deathstroke may say he has a code of honor, but he's an asshole-- he might just take Batman's money and just go do the job he was doing anyway.
