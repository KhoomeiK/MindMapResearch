The command noclip disables those and lets you see the skybox. Everything is working as supposed to.
As a glitch is defined as an error or a temporary fault, this is not a glitch, neither is it a bug.
Edit: How are you bringing up easter eggs now? I mean thats even further away than glitch or bug."

I think its too many cuts. Its too fast. Try using less single clips.

I think some of the frags are (not trying to be mean) average. Focus more on the really good kills or multi kills. Try using slow motion to make a clip with only one kill look more impressive and slow the action down a bit."
