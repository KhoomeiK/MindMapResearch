If it wasn’t election interference, or pedophilia, or nepotism,  or fraud, racism or general lying then it has to be if he’s re-elected. 

You guys need to cut the parasites out and I mean plural, the whole GOP is complicit. 

Every nation needs to identify and remove agents of disorder, claiming to be republicans but are instead shills for corporate greed. 

Money needs to leave politics, in all forms.

Who to love, how to love, where to go, how to get there and what to be. Where before you were just trying to show them how not to be an animal, now you’re going to show him how to be a Man.

todayilearned,ff7km3y,t1_ff6rimi,1579651780.0,"Think of it as reinvesting in the economy, providing shelter and basic amenities for people too destitute to contribute to society, maybe even going so far as to include mental health services exclusive for this city. 

Build a pseudo care center for the mentally wrecked, you can create many jobs for many industries by doing this and potentially recoup the losses on unproductive citizens by treating addiction/mental health issues/serious physical trauma. 

Of course it’s a bit of a dream, you’d have the issue of maintaining it at a cost(though I’m sure the military could build a town like this 20 times and run then all for a year)

Not to mention finding enough people to do the jobs, though if you pay enough then people will flock. 

And of course location like we discussed, can’t find workers willing to commute 3 hours everyday for a reasonable wage. 

I mean, it still fits my point that enough money can build nations, let alone solve relatively simplistic things like poverty."

todayilearned,ff5vwbw,t1_ff58y8k,1579612035.0,"Location I’d agree on, but you’re wrong on land.  Federally owned land makes up more than individual land owners.

Also: “We can’t just throw money at a problem like land! There isn’t enough money in the bank to buy out single family farm owners! They won’t just accept money!”"

We can’t just use the money to have it inspected(more jobs) then use more money to have professional property managers and law enforcement ensure proper caretaking of the houses!(more jobs)” 

Totally not a money problem, money definitely doesn’t facilitate all means of action in capitalism."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff4d569,t1_ff49nh0,1579560799.0,"The ruling class is what you need to sway, you’ll never ever in a million years sway every dumbass racist Tom, Dick and Harry unless you get the government to tell them otherwise and even then that ended in a war.

That’s because minorities are the scapegoat. Anything that goes wrong is a foreigners fault not theirs. Anything that changes in their lives is because of those fucking liberals/negroes/immigrants. 

These type of people are just mad, some dating their racism back to slavery, but all of them looking to bully someone who can’t fight back. What better than those different coloured people who don’t have the numbers to resist. 

When you do resist it only makes them angrier too. You become a “domestic terrorist” or a Drug Dealer or a criminal, then they believe you don’t deserve a say."

Democratic socialism is literally cherry-picking the best shit from each side. Communism’s idea the collective working to preserve itself and capitalism’s idea of working for your share. 

Free healthcare, better homeless shelters and rehabilitation, free water, Free fucking education. They’re basically saying they want to take care of your kids financially while you worry about how they turn out psychologically.

If you are a fan of old arena shooters like doom then you’ll love serious Sam. 

Lots of guns, huge arenas and hundreds of enemies to kill. Can be very challenging or just a leisurely walk in the park depending on which difficulty you pick.  

Play them in 3,1,2 fashion though since 3 is the newest but is also a prequel. 

Also if you think you have balls and want to pick Serious difficulty then buckle the fuck up, seriously."
