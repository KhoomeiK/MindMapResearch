Both in the back seat, the lighting is the same as well, using reflections on the car to add to the ""fantasy"" aspects of it all. The only difference Joker is in the back in Joker. 

For the Wayne's murder, they copy the Pearl breaking scene and setup, where the camera briefly follows the pearls down. I believe it is in one comic, The Dark Knight returns I think.
