Your kids are so lucky that you have broken the chain of negativity and you love them unconditionally. You sound like a wonderful wife and mother. Keep on being you, and yes you deserve that treat as well!"
aww,fecu12k,t3_eogzd2,1578984588.0,What a looker. Good personality too?
MomForAMinute,fe4rf0t,t3_en2eex,1578862082.0,Well I am glad. Having mega crushes is such an important part of growing up. I hope you either find a fabulous girl who makes you happy or have fun trying.

MomForAMinute,fcky8dw,t3_egzdee,1577735754.0,There is no magic pill to make everything ok and that really sucks. You deserved better and you have been let down over and over by your parents. But... keep fighting for yourself. Keep up the therapy. Keep seeking better. You are doing the right thing and it’s the only way to make things better.
cats,fck53nc,t3_ehlrtn,1577716843.0,What a gorgeous looking guy. He was so fabulous.
notliketheothergirls,fcfrqav,t1_fccmnzp,1577633122.0,"Clap back to when you said not to measure yourself from fake internet points. 

FWIW you’re a fascinating personality creation in my opinion. But I’m glad I don’t know you in real life."
MomForAMinute,fcfkqoi,t1_fcapour,1577631003.0,"Sorry for the delay... I didn’t notice you replied (plus I’m in the UK and I went to sleep). I hope you didn’t think I’d forgotten you!

I can’t say this enough... you are doing everything right. Wanting the change and deciding to make it is 90% of the battle. Your brain is wired to anger from the neglect, you have to choose to not be angry because you haven’t been taught it... AND YOU HAVE CHOSEN THAT. Your daughter is so lucky that you are fighting for her
X"
MomForAMinute,fcamy0r,t1_fcalcwn,1577572444.0,"Of course she did. She couldn’t look after you then and, unless something has changed, she won’t be able to take responsibility now. Don’t let her put you down, she’s done enough of that already. She has probably suffered abuse but that doesn’t excuse her abusing you. It’s a cycle and it takes someone strong, like you, to break it. Honestly, it’s so hard but so worth it.  And the fact that you are trying makes you a rock star (even when you feel like the opposite). 

I wish I knew why so I could tell you and so we could stop it happening to other kids."
MomForAMinute,fcakvhr,t3_eft5bd,1577571209.0,"You don’t need to be sorry, I know you always did your best. Christmas is so hard, I hope you have someone to talk to"
MomForAMinute,fcakmnz,t3_eg5km7,1577571063.0,Thanks for noticing XD
MomForAMinute,fcakk20,t3_eg7jjg,1577571017.0,"Oh wow. So much to unpack there, you have been let down by your mum and all the other adults who should have protected you and that is incredibly unfair. You deserve better. A lot better. Undoubtedly the problems you have described stem from the trauma you experienced. As a foster Carer I see young people with similar emotional and behaviours all the time... it’s how you survived. Rewiring your brain will take time but you can do it. 

I’m so proud of you for fighting for yourself. For seeking the help of a therapist. For challenging your past. For seeking a clearer future. There is another way, you can make it xxx"
