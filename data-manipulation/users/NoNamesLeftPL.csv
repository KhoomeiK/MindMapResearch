2. Give some time and collect some evidence of various activity you’ve listed.

3. Report them for the extension because regardless of their behavior, FACT IS the damaged your property, and need to fix it. If reporting is the least resistant way than do it.

4. Keep recording and reviewing daily.

ElvisDuranMorningShow,feh9iuo,t3_eottbc,1579111955.0,"Listening since about 1997 when i was in 7th grade (Thanks Mom!). Now i have 3 kids and feel like a vet in the Elvis Duran crowd. I've seen John Bell leave, Christine, Carolina, TJ, Bethany, Carla Marie, etc. but the show has always brought me laughs. It's the only reason I have the iheartradio app tbh.

I do agree that the Carolina days were some awesome times, probably the best. Bethany was good but somewhat a lul compared to Carolina, and i get the feeling there was clashing behind the scenes with her. She just seems so different and they always mention not everyone was a good fit but dont specify (rightfully so).

Like another comment said, during the 2010-2014 years there was so much new material that came out, it feels now like a lot of it is being kept on because it works but not a lot of innovation in terms of new segments.

Not horrible, but not at its best.
