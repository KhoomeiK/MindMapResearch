Cringetopia,fet4e1m,t1_fes7wxc,1579371738.0,"Fish feel the sensation of pain but they don't experience it in the same way mammals do. There's no conscious awareness of it because fish lack a neocortex and c-nociceptors (which are involved in intense experiences of pain in mammals). That's the science on it, as far as I know. Fish literally lack the ability to suffer.

The second one turned on, but it only spun once before the motor burned out. The third one (from a different company) was impossible to use because I could never get the load to balance. I tried tried sorting and inserting my clothes about 50 different ways before giving it up as defective. I returned that one too.

CPTSD,fe4sg8p,t1_fe4q6re,1578862332.0,"Thing is, having a spinal cord injury means you basically lose all say in your life for a long time and it’s terrifying. It was the darkest time of my life, even my worst childhood trauma paled in comparison. My sister (who was my caregiver) and I both developed a fresh layer of cptsd from the situation. So at that point in my life the wheelchair felt like freedom. The wheelchair gave me the ability to make my own decisions and to do things for myself. My bed was a prison without it. And if you ask anyone who uses a wheelchair long term they’ll say the same thing, they aren’t wheelchair “bound”, the wheelchair is what frees them.

CPTSD,fe0dake,t3_enek38,1578810620.0,"So, a year ago I had a spinal cord injury and lost the ability to walk. I’ve spent the past year since then regaining that ability. I’ve done all the hard work, but I couldn’t have done anything without using tools like a wheelchair, walker, cane, shower bench, etc. Without those tools I would still be bedridden.

You mentioned cheating down below, so I ask you: was it cheating for me to use a wheelchair to get around?"

People aren't kidding when they say that minimalism is a process that takes years. It's something that you learn to do over a long period of time. It takes a while to really train your brain to sort through things, and with your first round of konmari you'll end up keeping a ton of things that later on you'll realize you should have gotten rid of.

CPTSD,fdx7qrr,t3_en8ns8,1578766129.0,"I've found that it helps to be firm with people who try to tell me what I'm thinking and/or feeling. I look them right in the eyes and say in a firm voice, ""No. You're not allowed to tell me what I'm thinking/feeling."" And when they inevitably keep doing it I just repeat that same phrase and refuse to engage their comment any further than just repeating it. The worst thing you can do is get defensive or try to explain yourself.

At this point they'll complain that I don't listen to them or care about their feelings so I'll look them in the eyes again and calmly ask what those feelings are. ""I care about you. Tell me what you're feeling."" Lather, rinse, repeat. It takes time and patience but you can train a lot of people out of their bad habits this way. My sister used to do this and I got her to stop by using this method. If they try to divert the argument by saying ""You don't care about me."" or ""You should know what I'm feeling without me having to tell you,"" just keep reiterating the second phrase.

Sometimes I would get frustrated with my sister and say to her ""you're not psychic"" or ""I'm not psychic"" but I don't think it was helpful so try to resist that temptation.

After you've gotten them to calm down and communicate properly, don't forget to actually address their feelings. They're upset for a reason, even if they're going about things all wrong. You don't have to capitulate, but if you care about them and want to continue the relationship you should at least listen, even if at the end your answer is ""no""."

It’s just negative traits that we pretend don’t exist. Herding dogs herd, pointers point, dogs bred to attack things... are nanny dogs lol.
