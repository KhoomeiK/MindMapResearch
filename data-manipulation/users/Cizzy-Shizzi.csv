Sleepparalysis,fffssfn,t3_etdv8v,1579891016.0,"There are two types of parasomnia called hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations, that occur when you are falling asleep and when you are waking up. Both these states of sleep are when most people see things. 

I do believe there is more to it spiritually, though, such as the possibility that your soul being immersed in the astral realm while you dream makes you more likely to experience other denizens of this realm during that time."
LetsNotMeet,fff7ttn,t1_ffevsk7,1579877886.0,"I can't believe I'm getting downvoted on this. In regards to your comment you're entitled your opinon as am I. Safely running a red light? Will you listen to yourself? Actively endangering your baby is much worse than the perceived threat. What if someone had T-boned her? Much worse than being a ""sitting duck"" for a stalker driving a car behind you...!?"

Spells,ffelapb,t3_esw2ff,1579852859.0,"Yeah man fuck that. If you don't have respect for yourself first then she will never respect you in return. Sounds like she's selfish and unkind. You deserve better than that, you CAN have better than that. Work on your self esteem issues and don't let her lower you to the same level, which putting a spell on her would be. Also, it reeks of desperation ... Can you imagine what she'd say to you if she found out? No, don't give her that satisfaction or the ammo against you. That's not love, man. Find out what really is with this new woman you mention."
