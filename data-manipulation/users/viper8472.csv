ActualWomen,ffd3rkk,t3_esxysx,1579812847.0,"It's so hard but it can be done. I would suggest group therapy, Buddhist metta mediation for yourself, affirmstions, and maybe even some psychoanalysis about why you feel unworthy. You can reframe old events and reprocess (or, re-understand them) from an adult perspective. It takes a lot of courage and for me it took a lot of grieving the life that I should have had.

People say otherwise but if you can get into a relationship with someone who is kind and respectful and has a secure attachment style, it will jump start your healing process to the max. Unfortunately sometimes we feel like we don't deserve love like that and choose someone who isn't kind or respectful to us. But if you can find it, that relationship can be a springboard for your self esteem.


In the meantime try to make friends with safe women who are positive and want you to be happy. It's not easy, you have to put yourself out there and do a lot of trust and error but if you have a therapist mentor they can help point you in the right direction. Good luck, it's a hard road but you can heal and have a great life."

preppers,ffcnhhd,t3_estbki,1579803205.0,"I think planning for short term emergencies, bad weather and outages is a good start before planning for SHTF scenarios with neighbors.

Getting to know the people on your block and what their needs and resources are. I have neighbors who hunt and fish, neighbors who garden, and neighbors with military service. I have neighbors with small children and neighbors who are elderly and/or sick. 

I think talking to them casually about getting everyone's phone number, in case of emergency numbers and keeping in touch with them regularly will really help in the most likely scenarios (weather and electrical outage.)

We don't have a plan like this but we are new in our neighborhood and haven't been proactive. This post really made me think about the fact that these people may be my best resource. 

The truth is, probably initiating social get togethers is probably the best way to start. I know a lot of us don't have much in common with our neighbors but it's good to get together twice a year at least to see everyone's faces and know their names and their kids names. It opens the door and lets you know who is more approachable and who doesn't want to talk to you. :)"

Our neighbors adopted a pitbull mix next door and we have tiny dogs so we decided to put up our own fence at our own expense. It helped. If you can afford it I would suggest this.

Defense people quoted us like $3,500 for the cheapest type of fence. We decided to take down all the tickets and reuse the old fence posts to redo the fence ourselves. The hardest part about the fence is putting the posts into the concrete or removing the existing fence posts that are locked in concrete. so taking the fence post placement out of the equation made the installation not so terrible for us. We spent $500 on pickets and supplies, and $500 on a framing nailer for about 150 ft of fence.

Even putting up one side of the fence would give you a lot of relief if the fence is 6 ft tall. They will not be able to see your child and dog and they won't attack the fence as much. It has been a game changer for us to be able to let the dogs outside for a bit and not have to check all the time. It also keeps coyotes out. Good luck!"

They haven't been proven to help with long term pain. I wonder if you went to rehab if your pain would get markedly better. You are obviously in physical pain. Going off opiates is brutal which is why it can't really be done at home successfully. 30 day treatment would give your nervous system a chance to go back to normal and you can assess your pain at that time to maybe find better physical treatment.

You can't get better with the hyperalgesia, it's brutal. Everything hurts. Some people can barely walk and after a week of detox they feel less pain. When you're in pain all the time, it's hard to care about anything or have the energy to want to make things better.


You are young so you have a lot to gain from getting sober. You might be surprised how much better you feel physically with your nervous system not on fucking fire all the time.

truechildfree,ff8yjr8,t3_es79ck,1579700164.0,"Congratulations on pursuing recovery for your painful childhood. It is very hard work and you are very brave to undertake it.

In therapy I had an older female therapist that ended up being a kind of mother figure for me. She helped me tremendously. However, there was one aspect that took her a while to come around on and that was children. I believe she thought that if I were to heal my wounded self enough, that I would no longer be averse to having children. I believe she thought that wanting children was healthy, and that when I put the pieces together, I would find the natural maternal desire inside me, and it would blossom with my new, healthy and whole self.

If being a mother was the healthy default, she would be correct. But I believe it is not the default. I believe some of us are just not into that job. 

Having children is part of our culture, *there is no evidence it is a biological instinct or drive.*

*Many, many people who have horrible trauma do have children or want them.* Many people who were hurt want children in order to ""fix"" the cycle, to give their children the life that they were denied, to show their children the love that they didn't get. People with narcissistic and abusive parents have children *every day!* 

So why in your case is the lack of desire to have kids *part of your brokenness?* They can't have it both ways. People don't have kids and also not have kids because of trauma. I was in group therapy with women who had horrible, trauma, and I mean *bad* physical and sexual abuse, drug use, prostitution, eating disorders. Guess what? They had kids!! At the same percentage as the general population! Oh, but me with my ""small t"" trauma, I don't want kids because *I'm broken?* Go fuck yourself! 

I think it's unreasonable to assume that. And even though my therapist didn't put it that way, I knew that she felt that if I healed enough, I would want kids. To her culture and generation, (Jewish female boomer) having kids was the best thing in life. She loved me and wanted me to experience the joy of family.  She was just operating on a false premise.


That created a problem for me because I felt like she felt sad for me, and in the back of her mind, evaluated my recovery by this measurement. But she was wrong! She was wrong. And it took me a long time to realize that my childhood actually didn't have as much to do with my decision after all. When I was little I never played with dolls. I had no interest in babies or baby toys. *I think I was born like this.*

I am a picky eater too. My whole family has problems with food. Is it because of our trauma? All of us? Really? Or maybe it's a genetic trait and we are just *like that."" But modern psychology doesn't know what to do with that, can't bill for it, and thinks everything is about your childhood. If I have low sex drive is it because of my trauma? Oh, I'm pushing my husband away because I'm avoiding intimacy? Or maybe it's because I'm fucking 40 years old and it's normal to have some drop off with libido. Is *everything* a sign that I'm a broken individual?

 People are weird and have weird quirks. I started seeing the similarities between me and my family members and started thinking that a lot of how I am is probably genetic. You don't have to see all of your weird quirks as learned from your environment. Some of that shit you just inherited from your weird parents and that's just how you are out of the box. Sometimes, there's nothing to really change except seeing yourself for who you are and loving and accepting that person. There's less to change than you think. Thanks for posting this, I had such a similar experience and watched other people in group be nudged to pathologize nearly every fucking thing they did. *""How I do anything is how I do everything?""* Really? What kind of catch phrase is that, Dr Reed? What does that even mean?

The best way to protect yourself from being with the wrong man is to take your relationship slowly. Take your time and get to know him. A lot longer than you think. Let him take you on dates. Not to his place. Do not go to his place until you are ready to have sex.

Being submissive might sound like doing whatever he wants, but in the beginning of the relationship you must control how slow the relationship goes and how quickly you become sexual. 

Really good quality men will not get angry or too frustrated when you make them wait for sex. This is one way they can determine if you are ""easy"" for lack of a better term. 

When you wait to get sexual with them, the ""bad boys"" or players will not wait around for you. They will move on to an easier target. Let them go. Waiting and taking a relationship slow at first is the best way to prevent the bad ones from entering your life, and it will make space for the good ones.
