Stadia,fgj69ff,t3_eyrrlm,1580837769.0,"In my opinion, Nintendo gets away with a lot of stuff that a lot of other gaming companies wouldn't. I am not really sure why this is, probably because everyone has the fondest of memories playing Pokemon and LoZ, that they don't mind dealing with the crap to play those games. Maybe it is also the fact that they are more of a ""light"" game company and most gamers don't use their stuff for anything more then a break from normal gaming. I like Nintendo, and I have a switch. I don't play it basically at all compared to my other gaming systems because it lacks the basic features that other systems have. I did play BotW and the new Pokemon game on it. Feel free to ignore me but I just been wanting to rant about that for a while"
