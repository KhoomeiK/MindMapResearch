teslamotors,ff9dpcf,t1_ff939l9,1579710764.0,"So I have a bit of experience in the realm of multiple-citizenships when US citizenship is also involved. Albeit, my case regards getting an additional citizenship after being a US citizen. In a nutshell, the US acts like their citizenship status overrules all other citizenships and is therefore not very compatible with also having other citizenships even if you do, in fact, still have other foreign citizenships. Once you take that swearing-in oath to pledge yourself to the US above all else, the US officially kind of stops caring about any other citizenships you may also have.    
    
I know it's not the most relevant fact in this thread, but hopefully someone finds it interesting that America's official position on this topic is: ""Eh... so what? He swore to us that we were the most important."""

space,ff0dh3k,t1_ff05550,1579467877.0,"This was answered in the official post-launch discussion panel. The explosion at that altitude is not much of a high velocity overpressure event, but instead more like a fireball at \~mach 1.5. That fireball is not too difficult to outrun(especially since the capsules are designed to handle high heat) and the abort procedure is completely activated in under 700 milliseconds which is plenty of time to get away.     
The short answer is no, a correctly functioning Crew Dragon abort system is safe throughout the launch(this even includes a catastrophic stage 2 RUD).     
    
Fun fact: The Apollo-era capsules had launch escape towers that were heavy so they were completely jettisoned very shortly after liftoff. The modern capability to safely abort at anytime during launch is one of the many reasons why the new capsules are lightyears ahead of the safety of old systems."

transit,fem0ehj,t1_felryv1,1579235757.0,"That's why I was disappointed with the Las Vegas project. On-par speed is 50-60 ft per day for tunnels 20-30 ft in diameter. The Boring Company is boring a <14 ft tube at 35 ft per day with ultimate goals of peaks of 100 ft per day (less than half the speed of German TBM peaks).    
I really wanted the Boring Company to be at least on par with the rest of the world, but I'm hopeful that they'll figure it out. After all, Musk promises 10x faster than conventional boring rates and it may take 20 years, but he does seem to have a way with motivating his engineers to find solutions to his promises. Until then, I'll still be commuting daily through my local German-bored tunnel with my Boring hat on my hat rack."

The route being built today is utilizing specifications to maintain 220 mph through the corners, but yes, the Bay Area section is being designed for 110mph service which is still exceeding the 102 mph requirements for SF-SJ voted on in Proposition 1A and it is in line with a 2hr 40min SF-LA total time. This leaves the Central Valley segment with the requirement to average 200 mph to meet the time goal which is convenient because it is being design led for 220mph service speed. All speed requirement data is easy to find on the Wikipedia page.   
  
You mention California’s larger transportation needs beyond SF-LA(which is the most popular flight path in the US) and those are also being aided with this project. CAHSR has already invested $1.3 billion in “regional bookend” projects which included $700 million to fund the Caltrain Electrification Project and the rest funds Bay Area grade separations, a new San Jose Caltrain-ACE-BART-HSR-bus station, 10 more Northern California connectivity projects(pg 139 of their Project Update Report from March 2019),  LA area grade separations, $423 million to LA Metro improvements, and funding part of the LA Union Station “run-through” project to aid MetroLink service, triple tracks from LA to Fullerton, and 7 more Southern California connectivity projects (pg 177 of the March report).  
It is an expensive project, but it’s cheaper than adding runways to SFO and LAX plus it is the added benefits of funding dozens of local transportation projects that the state’s cities badly need.

FairytaleasFuck,fdcbhs2,t1_fdbfnvg,1578270969.0,"Yep this is me. However, there is a difference between not having nights out with friends and not having anyone to talk to if anything is going wrong. Many people aren’t prepared for the latter because most of their old friends and family are back home in a different country and can’t relate to Switzerland."
FairytaleasFuck,fdazpkp,t1_fd9uawq,1578252125.0,"There are dozens of challenges so I’ll just focus on one. Lack of a social life is the big one that every expat deals with every day.  
Switzerland is infamously difficult to make friends in and even harder for a foreigner. Swiss people are very closed off so your best chance to make friends are with other expats. However, all expats(myself included) live in precarious living situations where if something happens to our job then we get kicked out of the country unless we can quickly find another job(unlikely). So many friendships with expats are likely superficial because you both know that the odds of an expat moving away is extremely high.   
If you have problems now and think that a move to Switzerland would be a fresh start for a new you, guess again because you are still the same person only now you are in a foreign place where most people really don’t want to be your friend. It’s also now takes a lot of work to maintain long distance friendships and family communications in your home country.  
With all of this being said, I’m from a reserved Finnish family so I find it lovely here even with minimal friends. However, many expats have breakdowns, depression, or just straight up quit and move home (therapy is popular here with mixed results). Switzerland isn’t a bad place at all, but if you need in-depth human interaction then it isn’t a good option for you."
FairytaleasFuck,fd87kdh,t1_fd83ru8,1578214814.0,"I have gone paragliding and hang gliding in that area. There is such an active and friendly flying community around Interlaken that is are an absolute pleasure to fly with. There are also lots of great companies in Interlaken offering tandem flights if you are new to the sport or just want a new experience. I did tandem hang gliding with Bumblebee and highly recommend their team.  
  
Living in Switzerland after living elsewhere has its own challenges, but if you’ve spent enough time here to know the cultures and done your research then it can be a great move."

AskReddit,fd3ls6x,t1_fd3a3m6,1578159558.0,"I’ve spent enough time along the borders of Iran to learn that Iranian citizens are some of the nicest people on the earth. Moreover, most of them see the ongoing conflicts as „the governments start fights, but it’s the ordinary people who suffer in the end. We need to stop killing each other.“ which is something I very much agree with. I have been invited over the border numerous times for tea or dinner only to have me decline because of my American passport. I have even had a large family come over the border from Iran just for me because I was guest in their area because „borders are just where governments drew the lines.“  
In the future I hope to visit Tabriz before making my way to Tehran via the lush green Caspian and Elburz regions. The people and the history are like nothing else and, as a grown man, I will breakdown and cry if the people that showed me so much love start getting bombed because governments can’t get along."
