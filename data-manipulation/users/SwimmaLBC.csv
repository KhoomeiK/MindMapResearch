Source: [https://www.twincities.com/2019/07/07/minnesotans-trek-to-canada-in-search-of-affordable-insulin/](https://www.twincities.com/2019/07/07/minnesotans-trek-to-canada-in-search-of-affordable-insulin/)

\*\*More on Insulin prices and it's history\*\*

The Health Care Cost Institute, an independent, not-for-profit research institute, looked at health insurance claims in the U.S. for thousands of Americans with Type 1 diabetes enrolled in employee health insurance plans. In 2012 the annual cost of insulin per person $2,900 US. By 2016, the annual cost had gone up to just over $5,700. That's a 97 per cent increase in just four years.

A more long-term (Source:[ study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2510902) ) found that between 2002 and 2013, the typical cost for patients increased from roughly $40 per vial of insulin to $130.

The rising cost of insulin is the single biggest reason why the average annual cost per patient to manage their diabetes went from $12,500 in 2012 to $18,500 in 2016. There are lots of U.S. media reports of people paying $400 per month and more.
