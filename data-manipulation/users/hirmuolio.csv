Normally you just set the color for each pixel on the computer screen.

Subpixel rendering uses tricks to make text on screen appear higher resolution than it is by taking advantage of those subpixels.

I think adaptations should mostly be judged as separate things. Especially when there are multiple adaptations that are compared to each other.

explainlikeimfive,ffc0elz,t1_ffb64dm,1579788320.0,"Lets go deeper to the level wher it is not arbitrary.

I assume you have had functions already. The likes of f(x) = y

Functions can also be nested.  
For example f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x+1  
f( g(x) ) = f(x + 1) = 3\*(x + 1)  
g( f(x) ) = g(3x) = 3x + 1

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are all functions. They take exactly two inputs and map to exactly one output. So lets write them using the above notation.

Like this:

add(2, 3) = 2 + 3  
mult(2, 3) = 2 \* 3

Lets write and calculate a simple equation like this.

add(2, mult(6, add(2,2)  ) )  

Now just calculate the functions from in to out.  

add(2, mult(6, add(2,2)  ) )   
= add(2, mult( 6, 4) )  
= add(2, 24)  
= 26

But that is so heavy notation. Mathematicians are lazy and want to write everything with fewest possible symbols.

So lets just go back to add(2,3) = 2 + 3 and mult(2,3) = 2 \* 3

add(2, mult(6, add(2,2)  ) )   
= 2 + ( 6 \* ( 2 + 2 ) )

But the mathematician is still not happy. He wants to write this with as few parenthesises as he can.

So he makes up a rule that multiplications are done before additions. 

2 + ( 6 \* ( 2 + 2 ) )  
= 2 + 6 \* ( 2 + 2 )

And the mathematician is happy with their compact result.

""Multiplications before additions"" is nice because multiplications usually are the inner function so they should be done first so this rule usually results in fewer parenthesises. Think of polynoms like x + 3x^2 + 5x^3. Those are very common in math. Without this rule it would be written as  x + (3x^(2)) + (5x^(3)).  
If additions were most often done before multiplications in math then I bet the mathematicians would have had the rule other way around."
explainlikeimfive,ffbwpvv,t1_ffbofy7,1579785266.0,"Multiplication would still be commutative even without PEMDAS. You just need to fully commit to the new system.

So instead of PEMDAS we have simple left to right system. Do operations from left to right.

1 + 3 \* 5 = 4 \* 5 = 20

But in this system you need to be extra careful when applying commutativity. You have to remember that addition and multiplication are functions that take exactly two inputs and map it to exactly one output. Commutativity exactly means that the two inputs can switch places without changing the results.

So what are the functions in here?

With PEMDAS when you write 1 + 3 \* 5 the multiplication is the inner function and the addition is the outer function.  
But in the simple left to right system the leftmost operation is the inner function. Addition is the inner function and multiplication is the outer function.

So in fact there is no 3\*5 in there at all. It is 1 + 3 which then is the input to the multiplication function.

1 + 3 \* 5  
= multiplication( addition( 1, 3 ), 5 )  
= multiplication( 5, addition( 1, 3 ) )  
= 5 \* (1 + 3)


Compare to PEMDAS

1 + 3 \* 5  
= addition( 1, multiplication( 3, 5) )  
= addition( 1, multiplication( 5, 3) )  
= 1 + 5 \* 3"

The day becomes longer.  

Now where is Tropic in this image? It does not matter.  

If you look at the second image you see that the day became longer everywhere on the northern hemisphere. And if you increased the angle more the day would again become longer in the whole northern hemisphere.


The day on which Sun passes directly above you is not the longest day (but it does have brightest Sun).

Day (earth rotation around itself) is not in sync with year (Earth's rotation around Sun).

In one solar day Earth rotates round itself once so that Sun is at same position in the sky (on average. It varies slightly over the year.). One solar day is about 86400.002 seconds (24h 0.002 seconds).  

One [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year) is time in which Earth goes around Sun once and comes back to the same position as seen from Earth (for example from summer solstice to summer solstice).

One tropical year is approximately 365.24219×86400 seconds. Which is the 365 d 5h 48m 45s.

Now try to fit integer number of days (86400.002 seconds) into one year (365.24219×86400 seconds).

You can not do that.

If you want year to have integer number of days then day wouldn't be length of Earth's rotation. The time of sunrise would be constantly changing.

Or if you wanted to fit integer number of days into year the year wouldn't be the length of Earth's rotation around Sun. The seasons would not be in sync with such calender."
