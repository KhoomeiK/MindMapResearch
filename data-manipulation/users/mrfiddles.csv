As things stand white male is still the default in most people's minds, and unless that changes any ""equal measures"" policy will ultimately benefit a white man more than it would other people.

TrollYChromosome,ff8s2g9,t1_ff7u5i6,1579693863.0,"So rather than downvote you I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not up to speed on Southern history.

In her era literacy and education tests were used to prevent the newly freed black population from voting in southern states. The phrase ""grandfathered in"" actually originates from the fact that the laws were often written with a clause allowing anyone whose grandfather could vote to vote without taking the test-- naturally, that didn't apply to black people as for the most part their grandfathers were slaves.

So when she's talking about not letting uneducated people vote it's sort of akin to someone saying ""people with alternative lifestyles shouldn't be allowed to adopt"" back in the 90's. They really mean ""Gays shouldn't be allowed to adopt"", and they're just trying to dress it up in friendlier and more reasonable language.

It's even more like the voter ID laws of today. Sure, it sounds reasonable for voters to bring an ID, but in a lot of places IDs are not free, and voter fraud(at least of the type that would be stopped by requiring an ID) is really, really fucking rare. At the end of the day, voter ID laws are much more about adding an extra hassle for poor people in order to keep them away from the polls."
TrollYChromosome,ff8rokm,t1_ff8necq,1579693397.0,"This is a perfect example of why the whole ""leave them up so we can learn from our history"" argument is bunk.

You might think she has a point, but voter tests have already been tried and they were used to disenfranchise black voters in the Jim Crow era. Fun fact, this is where the phrase 'grandfathered in' originates, as the voter tests was waived for anyone whose grandfather could vote-- in other words, white people.

TrollYChromosome,ff5kqhl,t1_ff5btg1,1579597575.0,"So first there's structural racism. A lot of white people take for granted that our system is some degree of meritocracy. The good neighborhoods have the good schools. A good credit score gets you better loans. These good things are earned by responsible people doing well, and they should be rewarded for their behavior. 

 What they forget is that all of that was set up AFTER black people were oppressed for centuries. These systems, which are not inherently racist, are still racist because they serve to freeze society in the same racist status quo. Rich whites basically walked out into a field and said ""ok, this is a baseball diamond and I'm on third base. Let's have a good fair game, no cheating, everyone is equal now."" 

This type of racism is very hard for poorer whites to understand because they are oppressed by the same systems. They're still at bat, just like poor blacks, so when aid is offered to black people they see that as black people getting an unfair advantage. Even richer whites can have trouble with this because they might take being on third for granted. 

Edit: A less serious version of this can be found in film. Literally. You might have noticed that sometimes black people don't show up as well in photos. This is because early digital cameras were made to mimic old film cameras, and film was specifically designed to highlight white faces because the inventors were white and the target market was white. The camera industry isn't trying to disadvantage black people, but carrying the status quo forward leads to worse outcomes just the same.


Then we also have **implicit bias**. These are the stereotypes that we all carry around with us. Black people have to deal with a lot of negative ones. Black men are much, much more likely to be shot or abused by law enforcement. They also receive harsher sentences for similar crimes. This isn't because the police and judges are overtly racist-- they're just less likely to give a black suspect the benefit of the doubt, and often that leads to worse outcomes.

This pops up even if you aren't a criminal. Studies have shown that having a stereotypical ""black"" name on otherwise identical resumes results in fewer calls from potential employers.

So yeah, society is still racist AF.

Edit: I should note that there are real concerns that machine learning and AI will actually mix both of these problems together. ML algorithms need to be trained by a human doing the task a bunch of times first. If the human has an unconscious racial bias they will actually train the computer to also have that bias. People tend to think of algorithms as objective things that only care about data. So they're a lot more likely to trust an algorithm to be objective, even if it isn't. Our implicit bias forged into structural racism."

However when you look into it almost all of these memorials were commissioned during the desegregation of the mid-20th century. With some very rare exceptions these statues were not erected to remind people of the mistakes of the past, they were erected to glorify the Confederates as a protest of blacks receiving equal rights under the law.

AskReddit,fejfsgh,t1_feiyhx3,1579172125.0,"The free market is NOT democracy.

In democracy everyone gets ONE vote. When a dictator holds an election and stuffs the ballot box in his favor we don't call that democracy, because it isn't. In a democracy the voters are equal.

When you ""vote with your wallet"" in the free market, the voters are not equal. In the free market a billionaire gets more votes than a small city.

I'm not arguing that communism has a better track record, but I'm just so tired of people claiming that free market = democracy. It's not, and it never was. The conservative idea of worshipping the free market as a meritocracy has its roots in the aristocracy trying to justify keeping their wealth and power after feudalism collapsed across Europe. They were essentially just changing their argument from ""god says I'm better, so listen to me"" to ""Meritocracy is good because the competent people should be leading society. Our free market system ensures that competent people are rewarded with wealth, so therefore it's good for the wealthy to hold power over the poor (nevermind that my family stole the wealth I inherited back in the ""god says so"" days and I have never demonstrated my competence, just keep listening to me, peasant!)""

Now, that's not to say that markets are bad, or that all people really are perfectly equal and should share power equally. I'm not a liberal snowflake.

I'm just pointing out that the first premise of democracy is ""people are equal and deserve an equal voice"" and the first premise of free market capitalism is ""people are not equal, and should be rewarded according to their ability"". You can't have it both ways. Western democracies are defined by the mixing of these two ideals in different concentrations. One is iron, the other is carbon-- together they make steel."

Wait a few hours for everyone to follow your new price, then buy up all of the cheap items and relist them back at the original price point."
classicwow,fddbd17,t1_fdd3qx2,1578303888.0,"They also might want the gold now rather than later. Why do people list GFPP and Elemental fire on Thursday? Because they don't want to wait until Sunday night to \*maybe\* sell their item. If you're dealing in a dozen stacks then that 1-2g price difference is HUGE, but if you've just got the 2 that dropped for your alt while questing then it's not the end of the world.  


Then there's also the people who don't want to bother doing the research. If I'm trying to sell something outside of my usual stuff, especially something with a high vendor price, I'll often do a pretty hefty undercut just to get it offloaded.   


Finally, there are people who purposefully manipulate the market. If you use a few alts you can create the impression that the whole market is moving down. This works especially well on slower days. Casual sellers drop their item into auctioneer, which just undercuts your artificially low price, and then you swoop in a few hours later and buy up a bunch of stock at a 30-50% discount. It's a dangerous game, obviously, but it can pay-off nicely."

It's pretty prevalent in the Earth's mantle, and it's believed that when magma is trapped at a significant pressures the iron sort of separates out like oil on water. If the magma then solidifies then you have yourself a new deposit.   


Also, it might bear mentioning that rust is just very high quality iron ore, so the buried remains of our civilization might also provide a few iron deposits relatively near the surface as well."

And as I've said, some people go as far as to advertise their status on their profile only to then be called a trap because the other person didn't bother to read anything and just swiped because they liked her photo.

I can empathize with your viewpoint, but I still think it's wrong. As for compromise, I really don't see a middle ground between ""trans women are women trapped in men's bodies"" and ""trans women are gay men who are trying to trick men into sex"". If you have suggestions I'm open to them."
