OneyPlays,fgkygue,t1_fgkg6bf,1580876712.0,"yeah maybe it's more accurate for me to say once they went multiplayer the humor got less snappy b/c of the lag and they are more focused on building/messing around than having funny conversations, but it's still fun af to watch"
OneyPlays,fgky3v4,t1_fgkxhmz,1580876436.0,"that's fair, her cartoon version in ""tomar's theme song"" has long hair too. I guess this is a pretty recent photo: [https://twitter.com/jaxamoto/status/1186735773250273280](https://twitter.com/jaxamoto/status/1186735773250273280)

(or something like that)"
StairsintheWoods,fgkxomp,t1_fb9822l,1580876118.0,"there's so much potential with the S&R stories, I'd love to see a series with local authorities finding weird stuff in the woods (maybe the FBI/CIA have to get involved), like a focused X-Files."
Missing411,fgkxgs0,t3_eyv36o,1580875955.0,"If anybody here has a YouTube account that can host long videos, let me know. I have a video version of this but can't upload it b/c it's too long."

OG Achievement Hunter fans might be reminded of ""Tower of Geoff""."
OneyPlays,fgk75ax,t3_eyuems,1580858927.0,"GTAV multiplayer would let them kill others in events like races and deathmatches :P

this may be more work than the bois want to put in, but I think we should start being able to see gameplay from others' perspectives. Ask the others to record their screens and have the editor do more work to show the most interesting screen at any given time ( think Achievement Hunter's Let's Plays), which is of course a lot more work, or upload three+ separate videos perhaps. just some thoughts"
OneyPlays,fgk6rvk,t1_fgjq9un,1580858693.0,"I could understand censoring ""n!gger"" or ""f@ggot"" or similar to avoid controversy but that statement is a strange thing to censor, other than YT not liking comments like that, like another user said.

what about 16:06? (which was preceded by ""cock and balls and dick"" :P)"

Missing411,fgjfpa6,t3_eyv36o,1580843071.0,I'm sharing this because DeathByMeme deleted his channel but luckily I had the audio for the main 411 video downloaded.
FringeHub,fgjfiki,t3_eyv20h,1580842958.0,Let me know if this works and other subreddits I should share this on. I also have a video file if somebody has a YT channel that can host videos at least 1 hour and a half long.
FringeHub,fgjcrq9,t1_fgiy7rb,1580841331.0,"I'm having trouble uploading the ""Missing411 - the Collection"" MP3 to Mediafire. do you have an email address you don't mind sharing? that way I could send you the file via WeTransfer.

I don't know if it's still useful but people have been asking for it and said they had a hard time finding it."
OneyPlays,fghhie6,t3_ey7cys,1580784940.0,I don't hate him but I'd rather watch Tomar as the third guy in Luigi's Mansion instead of him. I'll prioritize watching other vids over this series. (it's possible I'll get tired of Chris/Zach/Tomar dynamic eventually but I'm not there yet) Nevertheless I wish Lyle a happy life of course ;)
