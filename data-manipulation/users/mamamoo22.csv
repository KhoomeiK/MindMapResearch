insaneparents,ffy278t,t1_ffy0cv8,1580337132.0,"It can feel like an attack when minor stuff is corrected because alot of people have been scared or abused by parents because of this. I think you are correct in correcting people. But if people are making a big point and there is a minor mistake, it seems like the big point is diminished by the minor mistake. Does that make any sense?"

The slowest settings were surprisingly worse and I think I set it below halfway. What seems comfortable for you is good. It was a great success and my wasted muscles built up quickly.

femalehairadvice,ffob4n5,t3_eucae4,1580075884.0,There are some textures of hair that frizz when thinned. Maybe you have that type?  You could try thinning out under sections if so.
Instagramreality,ffiwqhv,t3_ett4kr,1579984571.0,The internet is not real. It makes a job difficult when folk expect this type of result in real life and often it's impossible. Or takes 6 months of work and lots of time and money.
