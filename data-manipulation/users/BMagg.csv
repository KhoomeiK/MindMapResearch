service_dogs,ffpph2y,t1_ffnhzd1,1580101222.0,"I agree.  Unfortunately, the dominance theory is still widely accepted and used by the public, especially older generations.  We have to remember that the vast majority of guide dog handlers are not trainers, and while they recived instruction on how to handle their dog and maintain training, they can fall prey to bad training or handling techniques too.  It's not acceptable, and needs to be addressed by the organization, but understanding why sometimes helps us help them in a more effective way.  The handler may have had people in their life that say to do xyz when the dog does abc.  And made the mistake of listening to them and not the organizations trainers."
service_dogs,ffpoypz,t1_ffnkitr,1580100770.0,"That's very kind of you to worry about the dog being taken away from them, dispite their actions.  I would guess the organization would try to work with the handler first.  They provide training on how to maintain the dogs training when they are first matched with the Guide dog.  But most handlers aren't dog trainers, so they may have a hard time understanding what behavior is appropriate and what is not.  Guide dogs are usually trained on a Martin collar with leash corrections given.  Those may seem like hard yanks on the leash to some people, but that is usually the correct way and what the dog understands.  However kick and hitting is never ok, as you know!  If the handler cannot be taught to handle the dog correctly, then that dog would be better off working for someone who will.  Guide Dogs are only one of the tools blind people can use to get around.  And they are actually pretty similar to using a white cane, just faster with a few added perks.  The handler still has to know where they are going and have good orientation and mobility skills, just like they use with a cane.  Plus technology is always making advancements that can help people with all sorts of disabilities, but especially the blind. 

I would do what others have said and try to get the organizations name off the dogs gear.  A description of the dog and handler will also help.  As well as the location.  Most organizations know what the handlers daily route is, and may have even helped train the dog in on that route in the beginning.  So the location/route will also help identify the handler.  I usually don't tell people to take pictures of teams, but if you can't see the organizations name on the gear you can compare it to pictures of other dogs from the organizations to find the match (they each usually have slightly different harness and/or vest), or you want to email the organization a picture of the team (maybe with abuse happening) then I'd say that's fine.  Your not posting it online for internet points.  If you can remember the little details, and if there is a good handler of a guide dog with the same gear, you could also approach them and ask what organization trained their dog.  Once you know who it is, write a good email with specfic details (hits dog with a forceful open hand strike, kicks dog forcefully, jerks on guide handle to the point the dog loses it's balance and falls to the ground) and what the situation is when you saw it.  You may not be able to see a issue, but a trainer may notice the dog doing something wrong.  Again, not that it's ever ok to harm a dog that way, but a proper correction may have been in order, the handler just goes way overboard.  The jerking on the guide handle is also very concerning because a harness transfers that torque to the dogs spine.  You can actually really hurt a dog that way, and that would end the dogs career.  

Some guide dog organizations retain ownership of the dog (and then usually pay for all vet care), some transfer ownership to the handler.  But all keep some sort of oversight and continued support for the dogs life.  Most also replace the dog when they retire."
dogswithjobs,ffoskb7,t1_ffnm9rv,1580081163.0,"Because it's kinda creepy to film people just because they are disabled.  It's legal to film people in public places, and obviously happens all the time.  Especially when you have a cute dog with you.  But it's upsetting to many Service Dog handlers to be filmed because it amounts to being flimed because you are disabled.  You wouldn't film or take pictures of someone in a wheelchair, or someones oxygen tank.  It's the same thing, Service Dogs are medical equipment."
dogswithjobs,fforxyh,t1_ffo5i6v,1580080907.0,"If you ever see something like this again, check the dogs vest for a name of the organization that trained the dog.  Or take a picture (kind a rude, but you have a legit concern as your reason) to match the dogs gear to what organization uses that type.  Guide Dogs for the Blind  Seeing Eye Dogs, etc are business names for the organization that trained the dog.  They usually also outfit the dog with their harness and vest or other markers.  Some handlers have generic or custom gear that didn't come from a program, or they trained their own Service Dog (which isn't near as common for Guide Dogs for obvious reasons).  If you can find any other descriptions, the dogs breed and color, the handlers appearance and the location (because the organizations know where their dogs go and often offer training for the handlers normal daily routes).  You can email the organization what you saw, and that you are concerned for the dogs welfare.  Some organizations retain ownership of the dog, and all should keep up with the dogs welfare and training.  They will be able to take the dog back, or help the handler better handle the dog.  If nothing else, organizations usually provide another guide dog when the 1st retires, so they can also refuse another dog.

Alternatively, speak up and offer help to try to diffuse the situation and subtly shame the handler.  ""Excuse me, there are groceries under that seat, your Guide Dog can't fit under there.  Can I help you find another seat with space under it?""  Then make a comment abour how the dog is so well trained and doing it's job so well.  That would also give you a opportunity to see the dogs gear or vest well for the organizations name, or ask the handler where the dog is from in a conversational way.

Same goes for Puppy Raisers for Guide Dog organizations.  The organization will definitely want to know of their Puppy Raisers are not treating the puppy right.  There is a lot invested in those puppies, and a bad raiser will ruin the dogs chances at becoming a Guide Dog."

Quite a few never buck or freak out at all, most do a little bit the first day or two.  But some are just more opinionated then others, and some are simply more high energy.  They learn quickly and settle into it well.  Once they get the hang of it and learn it's not scary or mean, they enjoy it.  Most of these horses have been raised in a herd put on huge pasture from birth to 3 years old when they begin training, and the go on to be working ranch horses or do other activities like sorting cattle, roping, or reining (kind of a high level skill where horse and rider need to move in sync while doing a pattern of specfic movements in competition where they are scored on each movement and how horse and rider do together).  They live very good lives with top notch care, fair training and the social time they need at horses.  Horses are very smart and enjoy a job and bonding with their rider.

Although when you came to class still drunk or really hung over the instructors would always put you in the horses who were still bucking and throwing a fit.  I've seen some impressive riding followed by puking off the side of a horse.  

There is something about how you sit on a horse that becomes very ingrained, so most experienced riders still stay on a horse pretty well when drunk.  A horses walking movement is also very similar to how humans walk, they actually use it for physical therapy.  But that also probably helps with drunks staying on the horse."

dogswithjobs,febjk62,t1_feaggvh,1578959478.0,"This is more of a response task, the dog sees her body language as the cue to do his task of getting her hands away from her face.  She may also have made a noise that the dog is attuned to listening for and then begin tasking/working.

However, there are service dogs who can alert before symptoms of a panic attack begin.  They usually are smelling the changes in the handlers breath when their cortisol levels rise due to stress.  Like Diabetic Alert Dogs are using scent on the handlers breath as well, so samples are taken when blood sugar is too high or too low, and those are used in training.  You can also do the same with high cortisol.

There are some dogs who naturally alert to heart rate, seizures, migraines, or other things we don't know what they are sensing, or cannot replicate it train.  Such as seizure alert dogs, we don't know what they are picking up on, let alone be able to replicate it to train the dog to notice x thing, then train the dog to do y.  So it's considered a natural alert, meaning it cannot be trained, the dog either notices something is going on, or they don't. Once a dog is noticing the thing, and you have tracked to dogs behavior vs having a seizure, so your sure the dog is alerting.  The you train the dog to do a certain behavior as a cue, such as pawing at your leg, staring intently at you, nose bumping, etc.  

Most service dogs are then trained to do a response task.  So say the dog has alerted to a on coming seizure, the dog could then retrieve a bag with medication in it and a bottle of water to try to abort the seizure, go find a friend or family member for help, lead their handler to a safe place to ride it out, etc.  During the seizure they can also do things to help like prop up legs or roll their handler to their side and support them there, stand over their handler so they are more visible, pillow their head, etc.  They can also help bring the person around and then help with the aftermath.  

So often there is a chain of tasks to be done, if it begins with an alert or a response it's still all helpful to the handler."

relationship_advice,fdtvvnr,t1_fdtjool,1578723062.0,"This is very true, and really, if your both inexperienced and nervous, I would not even expect the 1-2 really fantastic times (depending on your expectations/definition) until you get more time together to learn each other and get in a good groove.  It just takes time and pratice, it's a learned skill to a certain extent.  

Even orgasm for women can be somewhat a learned skill, which is usually best learned solo and then applied to sex with a partner.  Has she been able to orgasm on her own?  Has she tried much, or regularly?  Does she have any toys?  Lube?  A place and time for privacy to explore herself?  Maybe some sexy reading material to help get her in the mood if she is not comfortable with porn.  Even a book or other instruction on her own body may be needed depending on how she was raised.

One thing I want to mention is good sex may not always include her getting off right now.  When women are nervous and men have this expectation that she has to come first, or their bad lovers, it creates more stress on her.  Which is going to leave her with negative feelings about sex in general since your experiences are so few right now.  One way women can avoid that stress is to fake it, which then makes the cycle even harder to overcome because she's basically lying in her communication (because she's feels she has too).  Another is to avoid sex entirely, or be even more stressed each time she tries, which is not conducive to her getting off. So accept that sometimes she may be perfectly happy to have sex to just feel close to you, she may be super happy to just please you, and to also feel good in a less intense way, even if she didn't come.  That can take a whole lot of stress and expectations away, which leads to more open communication, exploration, and eventually, her orgasm happening naturally down the road.  All that doesn't mean you still shouldn't be trying to make her feel good and exploring what works for her, but don't push it if she starts claming up.  

And remember, sex can be goofy and fun too!  Laughing together helps reduce stress and make a positive impact on her views of sex.  Serious sex can be stressful when your already unsure of yourself.  Breaking out the wipped cream and being silly will always break the ice!  Even playing sex games, having some fun with props, food, toys, paint, etc.

Encourage her to keep up the solo time, maybe by setting up a nice bath, some toys, maybe some wine to relax her, and privacy.  If you both are more comfortable writing then talking maybe write to each other about it, talking about fantasies and what feels good.  Don't just ask if she was sucessful, ask her what felt good, ask was she close, etc."

dogswithjobs,fdf5e4k,t1_fdezr86,1578353699.0,"No, hip dysplasia is a problem with the hip joint only.  Many breeds are far, far more prone to hip dysplasia then GSDs.  In fact, breeds with the rolling gait like bulldogs have a extremely high rate of hip dysplasia.  

So the hip is a ball and socket joint, you can imagine that by making a fist with one hand, and then cupping your other hand over it.  Now, to hold the ball/fist portion of the joint into the socket/cup part of the joint, the socket/cup needs to be deep enough.  If we are comparing the socket/cup part to dishes, a healthy joint is like a cereal bowl and a joint with hip dysplasia is like a saucer.  You need the right amount of depth to the socket so the ball can sit in it without slipping out.

There is also testing that can be done to score hips, the most common organization for this is OFA, they score hips on a scale from excellent to poor when the dog is fully developed at 2 years old.  An alternative to OFA is PennHip, they give a measurement as the score and it can be done on younger dogs.  However, for both the dog needs to be xrayed in a very specfic position.  That position isn't all that comfortable for a dog, and they need to be relaxed and still for a good xray. So dogs are usually sedated for it and good breeders, of breeds that need this testing, have their dogs all scored before breeding.  The reason why we still get dogs with hip dysplasia is because it's not all genetic.  So you could have both parents with ""Excellent"" hips, even several generations back, but a puppy may end up with ""Fair"" hips because of other factors.

Also, GSDs do not have a sloped back.  When you see them standing with that sloped shape to the back, make sure to look at their legs.  They are standing in what is called a 3 point stack, meaning one hind leg is positioned well under their belly instead of being back next to their other hind leg.  That other hind leg is also positioned a bit father back behind them.  So they are kind of doing a runners stretch, which lowers the pelvis giving that sloped back look.  But if the same dog is placed in a normal stack, meaning all four feet are positioned in a rectangle and the dog is standing naturally, their back os now flat and straight.  So while show dogs are placed in a position to alter their overall outline and shapr making them appear to have a slopped back, it is just how they are positioned.  Show dogs are also taught to gait (run) in a specific way to accentuate their breeds movement style, which is to cover as much ground with as few steps possible.  Remember show dogs are doing just that, showing off and being flashy!  It's not how they look when they are relaxing, playing and hanging out."

Mals seem to be the most common from what I have seen, but quite of a few of them are cross bred too.  Since brindle would be recessive in that cross, the Dutch/Mal crosses all look like Mals.

There is a reason most agencies buy pretrained dogs from well respected training centers, and it isn't because its cheap.  They send their handlers for a 6 to 8 week course where they are paired with their new K9.  That really isn't enough training time for a new handler, so the department really needs to help the team develop once they get home.

Dog agression in particular would make it hard for training facilities to manage them.  Also, APBTs are Terriers and they are just more independent and stubborn in nature, by design.  Any K9 needs to work closely with their handler,  so herding breeds have been the most sucessful due to their bidable nature.

In the end, working dogs are bred for the job for good reason.  So using rescue dogs with unknown histories, or dogs from indiscriminate breeding, would lead to a very high rate of failure before they got to the level of actually working.  That would make it unsustainable as a business, and it wouldn't be a answer to the Bully Breed population/rescue issue.

But every once in a while you find the perfect match, which is why there are a couple pit bull (or bully breed mixes) being worked in drug or explosive detention for law enforcement.  There are a couple organizations that seek out and train rescue dogs for drug detention for law enforcement agencies, which is great!  

Duel purpose K9s need a rock solid mind and the confidence to back it up.  Plus that training begins as very young puppies, as well as the careful socialization.

In a individual kennels breeding program they may call a dog from different lines a outcross.  But as a breed, like in Dobes or Dalmations, they would bring in a different breed of dog for a controlled breeding program with the intent to use the other breeds genetics to help the orginal breed with a specfic issue.  The breed picked to be bred with is a similar type of dog and of a breed that has the genetics needed.

Since Dalmatians did a sucessful outcross program I'll explain theirs, in a simplified way.  So Dalmatians are very prone to bladder stones, way back when the orginal dogs that created the breed apparently all of them had a gene that made them produce more uric acid, which is what turns into the stones.  Those stones can cause a lot of isses, even death, so it was kind of a problem (/s).  When a veterinarian figured this out in the 70s he decided to breed a female dalmatian to a well bred male Pointer.  Since Pointers carry the correct gene, and that gene is dominant, he could then breed those puppies to Dalmatians again and keep the gene to fix the stone issue.   
Pointers are also a similar breed, so the resulting puppies would be more consistent. 

So the first litter was 1/2 Dalmatian and 1/2 Pointer.  Then he bred those puppies to a Dalmatian again so the next genetic was 3/4 Dalmatian and 1/4 Pointer.  And so on for 10 generations!   All of those generations had the correct gene, so no issues with stones.  They are usually called Low Uric Acid (LUA) Dalmatians now.  

However the problem is, breeds are made up of registered dogs.  And the vast majority of those registries are what is called a Closed Registry.  Meaning no dogs but the puppies produced from dogs already in the registry will be registered.  Now in a healthy breed with a good population, there is enough genetics to go around and selectively breed to fix issues.  You can take a dog that isn't related for 10 plus generations and breed them too a dog from very different bloodlines within the breed and have very good genetic diversity.  Problems pop up when either a large percentage of the breed as a whole all have a genetic fault.  Either because of a wide spread issue, or because of a small population.  Some genetic diseases are also harder to breed out then others."

Usually it comes down to body language, dogs are experts in body language.

That is why K9s aren't let loose to chase down and apprehend someone of there are other people around.  Good law enforcement agencies do training with their dogs to kind of recognize other cops in uniform, so if multiple cops are chasing the perp the dog should run past them and grab the person not in uniform.  But that isn't always effective in a real life situation and so they try not to do that.  That's why the K9 unit is usually in front and the other cops will kind of hang back.  Not only is the dog the fastest, it's their best chance on catching the perp at that point.  K9s are usually trained to only trained to engage a moving person, if someone is still and calm a well trained dog should just ""bark and hold"" which just means the dog is going to bark at you to keep you in that spot until the handler gets there.

The over all body language of the dog will tell you more, and with experience you can also pick up on how the dog is wagging its tail as a part of the body language as a whole.

This dog is excited to do his job, he had been sitting in the car watching this ""bad guys"" body language and getting amped up.  Dogs are experts on body language, but even we can clearly see this guys body language was projecting he was looking for a fight even before he punched the cop.  So the dog has been focused on this guy, and they are trained in handler protection.  So basically when someone makes an sudden agressive move towards their handler, like to punch them in the face, they will bite to stop the threat.  All that means as soon as the handler opened the door the dog knew what was up and was Super Excited to do it!  His high tail carriage and tight wags show he is amped up, focused on the exciting thing at hand.  He isn't in a wiggly, soft body, lower tail wagging, relaxed but happy body posture like a dog greeting someone or another dog would be, if they are behaving appropriately.  The K9 is clearly in drive (means amped up and focused) and extremely excited to participate and do what he is trained to do!  So his muscles are tight in anticipation, and once he on the bite the tail wag is almost a 2nd thought.  You can tell the tail is kind of doing its on thing in a way, he is completely focused on the bite, as he should be, and his tail is high partly because of how he is using his back and core to help get the guy to the ground by backing up.

But a K9 is not attacking a perpetrator, they are basically going to get and hold onto a toy, it's a game, a very high energy and exciting game.  They have been trained to go bite and hold in specfic way to minimize damage to the perp.  A dog attacking is not going to bite in the same locations or in the same way a K9 does.  They are not reacting from aggression or fear (which most pet dog agression is rooted in).  K9s bite a perp the same way they bite a bite sleeve or a bite pillow in training.  A dog that attacks because of agression would not even make it half way through the training process, it's pretty easy for a experienced trainer to spot it in a young puppy so they wouldn't even be selected for the program to begin with.  And selective breeding makes a huge difference, as does how a dog is socialized.  A stable mind and confidence are the big factors in temperment for working dogs.  They can't be afraid, nor can they be aggressive.  They need to be confident enough to withstand all sorts of things going on around them while they do their job.  They have to want their reward, usually a ball, more then anything.  But they also need to be able to walk around the community and meet people, live with their handler at home, and do their other jobs like scent work.  

An aggressive dogs body language is totally different, they also give warning signs that people miss or have trained out (punishing a growl for instance).  There is also a bite scale for how the dog bit, which tells a lot about how agressive the dog is.  None of the bites on the bite scale are anything like a K9s grip, and for good reason!"
JusticeServed,fd7v4ob,t1_fd7nqit,1578210594.0,"I think part of why you hear about K9 units so much is people focus on the dogs.  Dogs are pretty much a guaranteed popular topic.  The other side of it is, these are dogs, not robots.  And they are high drive dogs at that, the average person would be completely floored at a Belgian Malinois in drive.  They call them Malagators for a reason.  They are like turbo charged mouthy toddlers who want to do everything, play with everything (using their mouth) and are smart enough to figure out how to get to the thing they want.  When they aren't sleeping, they are 1000mph busy busy busy!  If you don't give them something to do, your house will become theor chew toy and playground.  They are not even remotely like your pet dog.  Then think about how these dogs are trained from a young age to get the thing.  Get it and keep it.  They are all the most confident of the litter, the one who wants to keep their toy the most.  Even as tiny puppies they show these traits.  Then their training begins with being held back while the thing they really want is in front of them, getting them really amped up.   All of a sudden they are let go of and they get to bite the bite pad.  Tug, be super exicted and then they get their toy.  It's hilarious to watch them prance around with the bite sleeve.  For the first good part of their training they get to keep the bite pillow or bite sleeve (just a toy in their eyes) for awhile after each time.  But there is a lot of build up to that, they basically get teased with it for awhile first.  Once they move onto bite suits and moving targets they know they are going to get to get it, no matter what.  Because training is always set up for the dog to succeed.  They also work a lot on obedience, scent work and the finer points, but their reward is still a toy.  Usually a ball, but many dogs really like a tug too.  And again, they do the right thing and they get the toy for awhile. So while they do pratice letting go, most of the time they get to stay holding onto their toy for longet then it takes to arrest someone.  Add in that the dogs absolutely read the energy of their handler, and in a real life situation they are even more amped up.  It's a different place, the energy is different, etc.  Even with the best and most diverse training.  Real life is going to be more high energy.  And these dogs live for nothing more but then to rise to the occasion!

In my opinion, the biggest issue is the handlers though.  Every single video I have seen of K9s not behaving, I can see clear handler errors.  Like when the dog doesn't let go, often the handler isn't choking the dog off correctly or for long enough.  Choking a dog off doesn't hurt the dog, it mostly trigger their gag reflex.  Or it .akes them have to let go to breathe, which they do before they pss out or anything.  But a dogs neck is very strong and packed with muscle, sot that protects it.  To choke a dog off you need to gather the collar tight and high (up right by the ears) and hold steady, firm pressure until the dog gives.  It can take a minute, which feels like forever in a crazy situation.  That is why many handlers think it's not working and let go to try something else, because time passes quicker in a amped up situation then in training.  Another mistake I see a lot of is not watching their dogs body language.  I have seen many videos where the handler thinks the dog shouldn't be in drive, but the dog has seen something to amp them up.  Then the handler isn't holding the leash well enough or is trusting the dog off leash and it ends badly.  The final thing I see is handlers not using good leash mangement when tracking in urban areas.  They give the dog more leash then they should and so the dog gets around a corner to much ahead of the handler and something happens.

The problem with training handlers sufficently, is it's a logistics issue.  You only have so many experienced K9 handlers.  You are always going to have rookies with their 1st dog.  And the fact is, it takes lots of time to be a good dog handler and even more time to be a good trainer.  Which is essential because dogs are always in training, certain  behaviors have to be enforced, new things pop up, bad habits build up slowly, etc. 
But logistics and cost mean new handlers only get a certain amount of time training with the dog at the training center alongside the trainers.  And there is a lot to cover when they do classroom stuff and then have to learn not only apprehension, but also tracking and drug detection.  Which are all very different skills for the handler.  Plus, these dogs are far from what people are used too.  They are not easy to live with or handle.  So 6 or 8 weeks at the training center may be enough for the basics in normal situations, bite work included.  Although, many handlers still need to learn to ""read"" their dog better and therefore trust the dog when tracking.  It happens a lot that the handler will basically slowly drag the dog off the scent trail because they assume the person went the other way, or their not sure if the dog is on track.  Then there is also how the scent can move due to environmental factors.

Anyways, the dog and handler hardly know each other.  The handler certainly hasn't seen the dog is it's highest drive in a crazy situation when the handler is also amped up and off his game a bit.  And the dog is going to also quickly learn what they can get away with with new handlers that don't enforce the rules the same as their trainers did at the training center.  These dogs are wicked smart afterall.  They also are super confident, so if their handler isn't taking the lead, the dog will....and sometimes that ends up with the handler bit.  All K9 handlers have been bit at some point, dogs get wound up, the handler makes a mistake with body language and bam!  They usually pop off pretty quick, but many dogs, or the team, go back for retraining for issue like that.  The last thing is that departments buy a trained dog.  The trained center is usually a private company that trains dogs for certain work.  So of the dog isn't working out with the handler the law enforcement department sends, it's not always just a case of getting a new dog who is going to be easier.  The training facilities usually have a class of several handlers from all over come at once for their training course.  The training center has dogs ready and do their best to pair up dog and handler basded on experience level and personality.  But there isn't always going to be a perfect fit because that class has more complete newbie handlers, or most of the dogs that cycle are harder dogs to manage.  The cost and times invested means they have to make it work and cross their fingers the team progresses nicely at home.  Some law enforcement agencies do more training with their K9 teams then others.  Some handlers are experienced  dog people and do more at home with their dogs.  There are a lot of variables, and many times you see some law enforcement agencies with really nice K9s across the board.  Some agencies are a shit show.  

So it's not K9s or the dog.  It's also not acceptable how some of these horrible situations have happened because the handler messed up.  But it comes down to how the whole system works....or doesn't work."

I believe the biggest reason they quit using Dobes was the health issues.  They are prone to a type of heart disease that they can just randomly drop dead from, the gene pool was also pretty much wiped out in WWII because they are a German Breed. 
The Russians actually developed their own working breed during that time called the Black Russian Terrier to fill the gap in their military. 
 Rotties are too strong, they also are not as bidable so they can be hard for a handler to manage.  You do see them still occasionally used in Europe where the breed has been kept a more healthy working type breed.  Both Rottie and Dobes don't make as good of tracking dogs from what I have heard.  With the rise of duel purpose K9s who can detect drugs/track (scent work) and detain suspects (bite work), they needed a breed that is more open to working with a handler and that is more analytical.  German Shepherds were the first choice, they are actually a herding breed that was prevalent outside German by WWII.  Now days Belgians have become more popular to due their more nimble and manageable size, and better joint health which equals a longer working career.  Most people are very suprised to learn most Belgian Malinois are around 50 pounds.  When German Shepherds are almost twice that.  

Belgians are also a herding breed and actually come in 4 varieties.  The Malinois is the short coated variety.  The Tervuren is a long coated brown w/ black trim.  Groenendael is a long coated black dog (called Belgian Sheepdogs in AKC).  And the rarest variety is the Laekenois is a wire haired variety.  The Malinois has been bred most extensively for K9s or MWDs because of the easier coat maintenance.  They should all be the same, but Malinois has been bred towards higher drive then the other varieties.  So the other 3 make easier pets, although they are still high drive herding breeds that you also see in bite sports like IPO or French Ring Sport with civilians.

Next time, tell a flight attendant!  They are required to accommodate you and a Service Dog team equally.  The Air Carrier  Access Act covers airports and airplanes in the US.  All personnel are supposed to read and know the regulations, but they don't.  Anyways, they need to accommodate you, and that usually means moving you, since your easier to reseat.  And often, the spare seats that are the farthest away in the plane are in 1st class.  So you could end up, not only away from the allergen, but also get a free upgrade!

I'm a long time Service Dog handler and I always try to do my best to help those with allergies or phobias of dogs.  When I travel my dog is freshly washed with allergen shampoo/conditioner, and blown out of all loose hair and dander with a high powered dryer right before a flight.  I bring a mat for him to lay on during my flight and he curls up in the tight ball and stays there for whole flight.  If someone near me had allergies or was uncomfortable around dogs, I would be happy to be reseated if they preferred not to be themselves for any reason.  Same for when we are in public, if people seem nervous I stay away from them, and my SD is always well groomed and stays as out of the way as possible.  He is also trained to not shake inside, like if he has been tucked under a table at a restaurant and his hair is wonky.  Dogs want to shake to fix their hair or sometimes as a stress reducer (they 
tend to ""shake off"" the stress after something has occured and is over with before moving on).  But I have trained my SD to wait until we are outside because it's polite and helps reduce allergens. 

Service Dogs are not allowed in carts, on seats or anywhere but the floor, including on a airplane.  Although you can see how poorly enforced that is.  They should not go near food or other merchandise in a store unless retrieving a item their handler is going to buy, if their handler cannot get it themselves.  You definitely see fakes out there in shopping carts, running all over, approching people, jumping on shelves, shitting from stress on airplanes, etc.  And it's just as frustrating to SD handlers because those fakes pose a direct risk to our needed medical equipment (Service Dog) by attacking them, which often results in a SD needing to be retired, and suddenly the handler is without what they need to mitigate their disability and try to live a more normal life.  Or by making businesses and the general public very unhappy with how thise dogs act in public and on airplanes, so when a real SD team comes along afterwards, they get the backlash.  Businesses need to actually read the law, and yse their rights.  That would curb the issue tremendously!  Airplane are a bit more tricky because pets are allowed if paid for, and Emotional Support Animals are also legally allowed (for free, so everyone fakes them, but airlines need to start following the law to a T and not accepting letters from paid sources, the law states the letter must be from a *treating* mental health professional for people with a mental health *disability*).  Anyways, I'll quit rambling but if you'd like any reliable sources (so much misinformation out there), I'm happy to provide some!"

Medication doesn't work for everyone.  It's fairly common for epileptics to be uncontrolled because of that.  People who have their seizures under control with medication don't have seizures, ergo, they don't have seizure alert service dogs.

So people being injured on a flight is preferable to having a Service Dog there?  What happens when a seizure comes on and someone falls on people sittong down?  Those people sitting down get hurt.  Not to mention the person experiencing a freaking seizure is also hurt.  I bet your one of those people who would be pissed that they diverted the flight so they could be medical attention too.

It must be nice being the center of the universe when even studies don't back up your point of view.  Tall to your doctor next time about how dander on peoples clothing is often worse then the animal itself being there.  That crazy cat lady who sat in the seat before you left more allergens then the dog 3 rows away.  The person who snuggled with their dog before they left on their trip sitting next too you is more of a risk to you then a dog somewhere on the airplane.  Especially when you can see, avoid, and be seated as far away from a service dog as possible.  The invisible allergens are more prolific and dangerous to you then a legit Service Dog team.

Or take your meds, because according to you, everyone has effective medication!

And if your *that* allergic, for your own health, you might want to drive your own car, and stay in your car while on vacation because contamination is everywhere."
entitledparents,fctjjrz,t1_fcs7cqk,1577945508.0,"In Colorado atleast, it's illegal to drive with it hanging.  That was one of the first things they told me about when I got it.  And I believe it's printed on the placard as well. 
 Not that it seems to ever be enforced, but it does restrict your view and when swinging can be a distraction, along with blocking even more of your view.  

My placard stays in the glove box until I need it, which gets me so looked when I pull into a spot (I looke relatively young and healthy from inside the car).  And often if my husband is with me, we don't use handicapped parking because he can help me with my wheelchair, so I don't need the extra space.  I can walk short distances, not very well, but like 80% of wheelchair users I can walk somewhat.  So I get looks for all sorts of things.  I got over it years ago when I would get looks for having 2 kids with me, like someone in a wheelchair is incapable of having kids.  It's extra funny because I would have my youngest on my lap and my oldest would often ride on the back of my wheelchair.  Or they walk next too, or behind me, behaving perfectly."
entitledparents,fctimx5,t1_fcsw2c9,1577944565.0,"Then why does she need a handicapped placard to park closer?  I bet she lives in a apartment complex or other gated parking community, because otherwise there would be no handicapped spots on private property, nor would a placard help her park closer.

So she is literally blocked handicapped people, who also live there, from being able to axcess their homes.  

Many wheelchair users use ramp vans that *have to* have space clear to the side for the ramp to extend.  If it cannot extend they cannot get in or out of their car.  They are trapped, and made even more vulnerable then disabled people already are.  Disabled people are more likely to be the victim of violence crime.  

So your boss is a major asshole.  Please report her.  Surely you can see this isn't right?  I get it, being afraid sucks.  No one likes it.  But imagine being unable to fight back or run away.  Being trapped away from your home, away from your medication and other medical equipment that you need to survive.  Having to park blocks away because the gated parking deck you also pay for in your rent, has no available handicapped spots because of someone who doesn't need it.  Now your either trying to hobble, painfully walk, unable to breathe, or propelling your wheelchair for blocks. Where many curb cut outs either don't exist or are blocked.  Your trapped in a short wheelchair, out of a drivers line of sight, in the middle of the street.  Or now your attacked, raped, mugged, etc because your blocks from home....when you paid to rent at that apartment because of the safe parking but this entitled able bodied asshole has decided their little bit of fear from a regular parking spot, *in the safe gated parking deck*, is more important then someones life.

Because that's the reality.  It's not harmless or no big deal.  People are so blind to others, especially those with disabilities."

It's insane she even asked because people with disabilities can be really injured if lifted wrong, they usually are pretty careful about who, where and when they are lifted.

That said, something like 80% of wheelchair users can walk, just not well or far.  This lady is crazy, but I always like yo mention that wheelchairs are necessary for many things then just being paralyzed or otherwise completely unable to walk.  I get all sort of looks because I can get out of the car, lean on it to get to the back and unload my wheelchair.  Or when I stand up to reach something in a store.  But if I walked around the store I would fall and injure myself which wouldn't heal right and would make things even worse for me."
dogswithjobs,fcteu01,t1_fctdnxn,1577940996.0,"Please find me an alternative to Seizure Alert Service Dogs.  I'll wait.  

You won't find one because medical science doesn't even know what these dogs are sensing to alert their handler before a seizure.  Sometimes that handler can take medication to avoid the seizure.  Sometimes they just have to get into a safe position and ride it out.  Sounds like fun on a airplane where there isn't much space to seize where you won't hurt yourself or others.

Epilepsy in general is pretty poorly understood by medical science because there are so many different types and causes.  The brain is still, in large part, a mystery.  

Medications work well for many people, and those people don't have Seizure Alert Service Dogs because they don't need them, because they aren't having regular seizures.  You know, those seizures that cause brain damage and possibly death.  Believe me, everyone with epilepsy has tried everything they possibly can before gambling tons of time, effort and money to take a chance that a dog will alert and work out as a Service Dog (because most dogs are not cut out for the job).  The trigger cannot be trained, the dog has to notice something is up on their own and want to do something about it.  Then the behavior the dog does to alert the human can be trained for that trigger, but the trigger itself is hit or miss.

It does happen to every legit team at some point because dogs are pretty stoic about not feelong well, service dogs *want* to work, and they can't exactly talk or understand that that weird tummy feeling means you have about 20 min to get home.

dogswithjobs,fcigh0r,t1_fci7ol8,1577662168.0,"There is a difference between a Service Dog and a Therapy Dog.

A Service Dog is specifically trained to assist their disabled handler, and are working.  Which means they should not be pet because it is disruptive to their work and they may mess up, resulting in harm to their handler.  Plus, their handler is just trying to run a errand, grab milk, or otherwise live their life and having to use a Service Dog for thise things isn't fun, let alone with everyone staring and bugging you making everything take longer.  Service Dogs are trained to assist one person with their individual needs to live a more normal life.  They are legally medical equipment and covered by a couple different laws depending on the location, the ADA being the most well known.  Their disabled handler is allowed to bring their service dog/medical equipment with them in public to have equal access.  They are usually labled with a vest or harness, but it is not required by law.

Therapy Dogs are not covered by any laws, and they can be most types of animals because of that.  They are only allowed in places where they have been invited to be by the business owner, for the specfic purpose of cheering up or helping reduce stress for a wide range of people.  Most Therapy Animals are certified through a private organization.  Basically the private organization verifies that the dog/animal is well trained and safe to visit people in a wide range of situations.  The organization also provides training to the handlers of they may encounter people in mental crisis, how to help, and how to handle their own emotions.  Then businesses, schools, airports, hospitals, nursing homes, etc can invite the organization's Therapy Animals in to visit and be available for meeting people and being pet.  The business goes through an organization because it helps ensure only safe animals are coming because they have been tested, and usually the organizations holds some extra insurance on their teams (each animal and handler are trained and tested together as a team).  The organization also enforces rules for grooming, vaccinations/deworming, etc.  But by law, Therapy Animals are just pets, there are no laws
that define or give rights to them.  They are usually labled with a vest with something like ""Pet Me!"" and/or they may approch people and the handler offers for people to pet the animal.

The final section of animals you'll hear about are Emotional Support Animals.  ESAs are basically prescribed pets, they do not have any specific training or requirements.  Studies have shown that having a pet is helpful for some mental health disabilities, so some laws allow ESAs additional rights over pets.  Rental housing and air travel are the only places ESAs are allowed, with proper documentation.  ESAs are not allowed in public (other then pet friendly places, businesses that do not make, sell or serve food can decide to be pet friendly).  As most people know, this has been extremely abused, and paired with the lack of knowledge about laws, it's become a rampant problem.  Airlines are cracking down on it, and rentals are not far behind in understanding and enforcing the law.  The law states you must have a disabling mental health condition and have a treating therapist or mental health professional ""prescribe"" a pet as part of your treatment.

So next time you see a ""ESA"" in public, they are breaking the law and endangering Service Dogs.  Tons of Service Dogs have been attacked, and then had to retire, due to people bringing their untrained dogs into public.  It's not cute, or no big deal, it's actively harming disabled people just trying to live a somewhat normal life.  

Add in the scam ""registration"", ""certification"" websites that sell you ""credentials"" for 49.99 are fake and hold no legal standing.  The websites even state that in the tiny, out of the way, fine print.  There is also a LOT if misinformation out there, so always stick to a .gov source if your looking for US laws.

Here is a great resource that everyone should read over and know.  Businesses need to use their rights of asking the 2 questions, refusing dogs who are not task trained, and remove dogs who are not potty trained, agressive, or disruptive.  If that happened, everyone would be more happy and people with disabilities would be safer.

dogswithjobs,fc25w7t,t1_fc0aitz,1577341812.0,"Hot sand can burn paw pads, and the problem is with most sogs, bit especially high drive workong dogs like this, is they won't show signs the sand is too hot for them until they have suffered burns and the flesh is peeling off their paws.  It's very painful and fairly long recovery from burned paw pads.

People really underestimate or forget that the surfaces we walk our dogs on can be very hot, and if the dog doesn't have boots on it's like you walking around barefoot on hot pavement.  So if you walk your dog on hot days, bend over and press your hand to the pavement for 30 seconds to see if it's too hot.  If it is, walk you dog at a cooler time of day, or invest in some boots.  You will need to train your dog to get used to wearing the boots, but it's really entertaining while they figure it out!  Just use lots of treats and praise.  They will quickly learn that boots are like a leash and mean they are going on a walk!"
