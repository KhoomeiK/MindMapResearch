Having a personal protect dog is pretty cool for a 3yo."

battlefield_one,ffbv64e,t1_ffbr767,1579783840.0,I'm in EU. There are some full servers but mostly during weekends eve. Will try later to see my luck :)
battlefield_one,ffbj2e5,t1_ffbisgy,1579767632.0,"Yeah I did that too, but most of the servers were 10/12 people in it :(

I'll try again later, as some servers are populated during evening."
battlefield_one,ffbipgx,t3_esom9e,1579767143.0,I tried playing bf1 again today but sadly couldn't find full server on Xbox.
gamernews,ff8ywix,t3_esboov,1579700452.0,I wouldn't hate them for downgrading a bit of game for Xbox.
BattlefieldV,ff6bu3j,t3_erua28,1579623777.0,Isn't he the one that showed up in Jakefrags video recently. The chill guy??
AskReddit,ff5pd76,t3_ero8mj,1579604572.0,He would be sad to see how certain things turn out to be but will be glad to know that there is end to it at some point.
AskReddit,ff4k6mx,t3_erhu3x,1579565590.0,"I have many but these ones still gets me thinking :

I was doing the same job with my manager but with different company and different staff?? 

There was a canal just outside of my house?? At a distance there was a church on other side of canal but it was on fire and ash was falling in sky with smoke?? 

I was engaged with something related to my best brother, crush and 2 long lost friends but where is he?? 

One neighborhood which come again and again in different dreams. 

And finally animals 

With a mix of other friends it got damn interesting"
BattlefieldV,feoquqz,t1_fenr7lm,1579304204.0,Iirc they did that in bf1 at some point and really skillful players got the bans along with cheaters. Tbh DICE always have problems with cheaters
battlefield_one,feooc85,t3_eq3toi,1579302979.0,Ah so I got 6 battlepacks for playing for 5mins today. Nice
gaming,fekvd2b,t1_fekl36h,1579208372.0,"Nope they already learned that in the past. The guys left and new management is catching up. I've been gaming for over 15yrs and I've seen this repeat again and again. 
Last incident that comes to mind is EA releasing bf1 and titanfall 2 along with COD. Titalfall 2 got the lower end of barrel last time."
xboxone,fekkl48,t3_epnmdm,1579201995.0,I'd pass. I bought a fully functional xbox1 for 100€ after going through shit deals like this for 3months. Wait a bit longer and you'll find a better deal :)
YouShouldKnow,fekgwod,t3_epgcr8,1579199801.0,"This happened to me too and it sucks. I saw on my bank slip that someone ordered something from amazon from my card worth 50€.
I contacted my bank and police but sadly they didn't help and my only option was to discontinue the card and get a new one. Couple of people I know were scammed the same way. People please be careful this is getting out of hand"

patientgamers,fehh0xq,t1_feelry2,1579116363.0,"Yeah I figured out that I'll need a lot pf time to actually enjoy this game but unfortunately right now I don't have it. I just play a couple of rounds of rocket league. Maybe during some holidays I'll pick it up. 
But one thing that I liked the most is how the world changes with time, loved it :)"
pics,feeacu5,t3_eolefa,1579029672.0,Wow very beautiful!! Thanks for sharing this :)
patientgamers,fee8g3k,t1_fed6xw3,1579028547.0,I'm feel the same way about this game. I played some 10+ hours and really enjoyed how different each quests passes on and the story is interesting but the lock picking and combat broke me. Since I work 60+ hours and only get 5-8hrs of gaming time usually I couldn't continue
AskReddit,fedf960,t3_eo6l00,1579009912.0,"During highschool our teachers had a genius idea of giving us responsibility to check our classmates homework before day begins and if someone is caught without it they are punished. 
Here's the catch, they made me responsible for my friends lol. None of us would finish our homework but I'd send 1 guys randomly everyday so it doesn't raise suspicion and rest of us were spared. 
I was never sent because I save all of us. Good times"
BattlefieldV,fe2johr,t1_fe1ac9u,1578839185.0,"You're correct, they tested it for around 2months  in CTE and then rolled it out."
patientgamers,fdzp6x8,t3_en8jkx,1578792721.0,Thanks for reminding me to sleep and not read about games on reddit :)
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fdxjiea,t3_en91xk,1578769307.0,"Its not this bad everywhere, the police in my area was really calm and were chatting with protesters and pedestrians alike. I think this happened in some of the rowdy areas.

EDIT: I'm not defending the police but was saying that its not like this everywhere. This is still a dick move to hurt someone for filming."
gaming,fdw2ohf,t3_en5b4f,1578754425.0,Type X for doubt.
BattlefieldV,fdsfnv3,t3_emvw4k,1578701692.0,Hahaha I laughed out loud thanks for making this.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fdqdd4k,t1_fdpb1e8,1578663668.0,"It is really suprising, I live in Paris and it is insane right now. We don't know when the strike will stop and public transport is on a semi halt. 
The businesses are down but strangely a major local population is in support of strike and believe they are making a statement against the government when in truth this is really bad for country and its future. 
How is not going to work and making if harder for those who want to work helps anyone make a point is beyond me. Plus if you ask any local on what he thinks about it he'll ignore you if he's nice or will belittle you saying outsider don't understand the French strikes or something along those lines."
worldnews,fdot6so,t3_emetoy,1578612322.0,"Bbc, al zazera and some news channels in France are reporting that he said it was shot down UNINTENTIONALLY. If true then these articles are misleading or the media is misleading but at this point can't say anything for sure."

gamingsuggestions,fdn219w,t3_em729o,1578574904.0,"If you don't mind old games the I'd strongly suggest you look in to STALKER. There are many mods that updates the graphics and go for misery mod first for the third game its the best.

Edit: just saw in comments that you're already playing it. Happy hunting Stalker :)"
GhostRecon,fdko0ay,t1_fdk7td2,1578507552.0,"Agreed, especially if you play it after finishing the main game it feels like a reward to stick around. Because of my work schedule I'm just 5hrs in but I loved it so far and eager to play more :)"
GhostRecon,fdjremm,t1_fdjlqit,1578484659.0,If you still want to try witcher the go for the expansion blood and wine first then try the main game. The expansion is fast paced and really showcases the best of the main game but the combat and movements are the same as it is essentially a game from 2015.
