ForeverAlone,ff4x3vr,t3_ernxx4,1579574539.0,"I assumed “normie” (though I’m not keen on the term) referred to a person living a normal life. The average person who hangs out with their friends, and goes out on dates to experience romance. I think it just depends on context for what the person using the word views as being the norm in their environment."

socialanxiety,ff37e0f,t1_ff35u37,1579535453.0,"Yeah same, but I wonder if they’re judging me because they’re assholes, or if everyone is judging me mentally and the ones making fun of me are just rudely vocal about it."

Not anymore, either because it became a repetitive topic, I’ve been talking less, or because I don’t talk that way anymore. Not the reason for my social anxiety though, since I remember being like this earlier than those moments."

Although I just assumed she wasn’t talking to me the first couple of times, but then I decided one time to check behind me and discovered that no one else was there, so I started to say hi back."
