self,fffz6gm,t1_fffclcl,1579894995.0,"You should be downvoted for this. Didn't think I'd have to add ""don't tell them they're just bitching"" to the list.



If I had said in person rather than on reddit that I was fighting not to kill myself would you say to my face that I'm just bitching?



If you actually cared you'd offer sympathy whether I gave solutions or not. That should be the common sense first thing, not hostility or ridicule. I didn't think I'd have to say that.



You say care about finding the right things to say but it should be pretty obvious that what you said isn't it. So you must not care as much as you say.


How about looking to see if somebody else has the answers like I said? The answers to your questions exist, or at least something close. Look on the sidebar and stickied posts of /r/suicidewatch or do a quick Google search. Just because I didn't spoon feed it to you doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and if you actually cared like you say you would've looked or at least asked me where to look.




And yes I am saying that, in at least my case and in the case of many other people I've talked to, those things *are* the wrong things to say. I never said you or other people don't mean well when saying these things, I just said they're not really helpful. I think it's 100% valid to point out a problem without giving a solution, especially when the solutions are laid out elsewhere on the internet. Isn't pointing out the problem the first step to finding a solution? How often do they come at the same time? 



And I was saying, in my case at least, these things actually make me feel *worse.* This may not be true for everyone but I'm saying sometimes saying nothing is better than saying these things. Why would you not be interested in minimizing the harm you do? Just because there isn't a magic wand answer doesn't mean you shouldn't care about at least not doing harm.


Edit: [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging) a link. If you don't care to read that your takeaway should be *don't tell a suicidal person they're just bitching, ever*"

I'm ok with being alone. I like being by myself. I go out to restaurants, concerts, stores etc by myself all the time and it doesn't bother me. The problem is just that being *totally* alone does a lot to ruin your psyche. Abusive family and only two friends who may or may not be emotionally available but live far away either way will make you feel alone no matter what.


I've been trying to find hobbies but nothing seems interesting or brings me joy anymore. I used to love some things like music and the outdoors but I just couldn't care less at this point. It's like my brain just isn't capable of registering pleasure anymore.

As far as hobbies go I used to be really interested in some things but I've kinda lost the ability to find joy even in them.

Doesn't make that much of a difference, just that I failed and dropped out of college freshman year when I was 19 with the intention of going back as soon as possible. Two years later I'm not only not back but I'm VERY much worse off mentally, am crippled under debt, and now realize I can't go back possibly ever.
