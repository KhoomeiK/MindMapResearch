Oh the shame I felt when I showed people that film. It's complete crap that the last six months of the military is not some form of job training to integrate back into the civilian world. Truck driving schools, A/C schools, Auto Maintenance schools, it should be part of getting out. I have tried to hire vets with heavy equipment experience, have gone to every ANG center. Nothing. Wow.

Literally couldn't get a job sacking groceries, and I had been a grocery store assistant manager in high school. Sold everything and moved back to L.A. with nothing but an urge to kill myself. Got a job in a dirty machine shop filled with Vietnamese boat people. Thought I had really hit bottom. They saved me. They had all been through real living hell getting to where I was, I felt like I was a refugee also. It grounded me. I started going to night school again. They pushed me to go, some of these guys had been fighter pilots in the SVNAF. That was the last brotherhood I knew, except for a few buds from the Corps. Finished school, kept climbing the ladder. I'm a corporate controller now. Make nice money. Hate what I do, hate most of my coworkers. Worthless slobs. Here's the point, you step across that DD214, you just a whore. It's about the money. You'll have friendly relationships with coworkers, but not like the suck. So don't you ever expect it. I thought having my own one bedroom apartment would be heaven, and it was for about a week. You get used to all that shit. Don't be in too much of a hurry to get out in the civilian world, now true I read you guys bitching about the fuck fuck games and I think, damn I don't miss that shit. But there's plenty of fuck fuck in the corporate world, it just comes from fucking pussies that you couldn't find a way to respect if you tried. So there's that.
