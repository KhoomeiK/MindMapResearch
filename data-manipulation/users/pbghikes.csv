AnimalsBeingBros,fftoed9,t1_fftm4se,1580225581.0,The larger point is that taking simple precautions could have lead to a living dog with many more rescues in his future as opposed to a dead dog that will rescue exactly 0 more people.

They aren't able to cool their bodies the way humans can so when working with a dog in a high energy and hot environment, it is the responsibility of the handler to cool the fog down and keep them from overheating.

Unfortunately a rescue situation is often a long and tedious process. 10 minutes is negligible. Also, once the dog is dead its going to take a hell of a lot more time than 10 minutes to find them. You need to stop."
