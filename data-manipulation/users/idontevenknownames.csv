BreakUps,fczvx0z,t1_fcyi8p1,1578109520.0,"Same here my gf just break up with me 20 min after new year eve she's my best friend, favourite person, i have dream a lot of spending time with her till i die, she cared about me a lot but since last month she started being ignorant and started making distances, would always make up excuses when i ask her to watch movies together. I have been crying everyday, a lot of sadness. Worst thing is she doesn't even tell me what's the reason she want to breakup with me. I can just hope the best for her. In my eyes she's the most perfect person. There's nothing i can do now other than moving on. Stay strong everyone"
