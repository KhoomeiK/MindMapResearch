And yes, I do know what I'm talking about when it comes to children's nutrition, as I have to work with a nutritionist regularly for my own child. Their recommendation? As much chicken, beef, eggs, cheese, beans, salad dressing and overall calories as I could get him to eat. Why? Because they actually help a kid grow when they're underweight from a crazy metabolism. God only knows what kind of shit we'd have to go through if it was ""eat beans with every meal since that's what you've limited yourselves to."""

That's not a varied, or well planned diet, and you know it. It's a lot harder to mess up when your meal choices are between (literally everything including things that vegans can eat) and Vegan Approved only. Protein, veggie, and a starch or grain as a meal combo are the a hell of a lot easier to plan when you can pick *any* protein. By enforcing a vegan diet, you're artificially limiting the child's food sources. You'd better damn sight have a nutritionist checking up on their growth and helping with meal planning, or it's more likely you'll lack something their body needs."

I feel bad for the kid who's a picky eater, especially before they can articulate exactly how they feel when they're not getting enough of something their body needs."
