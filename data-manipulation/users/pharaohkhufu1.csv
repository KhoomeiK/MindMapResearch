WE the people pay these people, so, we OWN these documents, which hold  no top secret information. This is a complete coverup! Republicans are racing to reach the end, so they can cast their predetermined NAY votes. May karma for them be harsh."

cats,ff396ol,t3_er7fi9,1579536643.0,I am so sorry. Cats are so special. We had to say good-bye to our 18 year old last year. She was beautiful like your kitty. We still have our two boys.

worldnews,fe4hjqa,t3_eni969,1578859389.0,"In the ""olden"" days, when a teen got into trouble, he was sometimes given a choice. Either he went into the service or got jail time. I imagine these kids grew up pretty damn fast in the Army. It does give them discipline they likely never had. Hell, at 21, you are getting set in your own way and would resist going (I believe). Sorry, but I say, get them young, and teach them all that is offered. My husband is a Vietnam vet (B-52 pilot), his dad was a belly gunner in WW II, and I had many uncles serve in WWII (all came back). Plus, a good friend of mine was a POW of the Nazis. If they served, then I think two years from a person's life is not much to ask (I mean, if you don't have bone spurs). They may find a career. Israel even drafts women. The story of my POW friend is even in my latest book of non-fiction stories."
