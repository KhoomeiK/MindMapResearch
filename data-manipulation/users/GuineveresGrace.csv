FemaleDatingStrategy,ff9paiw,t1_ff9blt9,1579717879.0,"It’s a dumb, unusual allergy; most people assume I’m lying about it. So, the first reaction is, ‘you could just say no.’ S H R U G."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff96t0k,t1_ff4df58,1579706195.0,"Think of all the younger women who’d go to his shows and be taken in. I think it would be the done thing to do. 

I had one musician tell me I deserved to be raped. Asked what his soundcloud was, and made him locally famous... just not the way he wanted."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff90wmc,t3_es47j8,1579702040.0,"I usually go for a ginger ale; I find that a lot of cranberry is too sweet for me, these days. 

As an aside, I cannot drink. I carry an epi pen on me at all times for the chance that I’m exposed to alcohol. 

So. Many. Guys. act like me not drinking, or not going to a bar with them is an act of willful defiance. I’ve been called frigid and high maintenance for saying ‘I don’t drink’. 

It wasn’t until my best guy friend pointed out that they were hoping to get me drunk and into their beds, that it all began to make sense."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff8z5hn,t1_ff82ebl,1579700654.0,"Just an aside to any Mods... I do crisis intervention. If you’d like to take a break and talk to a councilor, my inbox is open. Thanks for taking the hit for so many of us."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff8xvuo,t1_ff8xok9,1579699614.0,"It’s all good, just wanted to clarify! I’m honestly a little shocked at the replies; was not expecting the ‘holier than thou’ attitudes of some. 

We are ALL WOMEN. All of us! We deserve better across the board, ladies, and if you believe you’re better than another woman because of her job YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM. 

Do not assume that you are worth more to these men because they don’t pay you. Madonna or Magdalen, we *all* suffer."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff8wul1,t1_ff8jtkw,1579698708.0,"I’m sorry, I’m not sure you understood my post. I’m not condoning this behavior; I’m condemning it. I think the attitude of ‘why get a gf when you can have escorts’ is just... sick. 

‘Fills you with hope’ was actually supposed to be super sarcastic, but my fault for not putting ‘ /s’."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff8l6f3,t1_ff8l3ii,1579683853.0,"Agreed! I thought the ‘Fills you with hope’ title was obviously sarcastic enough, but I’m starting to think it wasn’t. Just really hate that this was the take on the entire gender; ‘why bother with them, they’re only good for sex’."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff8kdi3,t1_ff80vrs,1579682646.0,"Wow, they’re real women too. Let’s try and support everyone, sis."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff7y1z6,t1_ff7y083,1579661079.0,Right?! So many dudes just treat OLD at a free escort service.
pitbulls,ff7wz8g,t1_ff7wycg,1579660342.0,"Oh hey, look at that! Thank you!"

AskReddit,ff5y94l,t3_eruto0,1579614142.0,"Gotta be NuMetal, to my mind. All the mall goth, emo trends."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff517us,t1_ff5122r,1579577480.0,"I was very tempted to send a ‘daddy can go fuck himself,’ but didn’t. Just easier to block and move on, instead of dealing with their hysterics."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff3x7jj,t1_ff3x4y5,1579550822.0,"I was so done, haha."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff30pa1,t1_ff2oibw,1579530546.0,"I’ve usually heard it in substitution for b*tch. Like, ‘typical female’, or ‘females want XYZ’, ‘this is my female’."
aww,fes7cf7,t3_eqdxd4,1579362161.0,Love that they’re in two different styles! Very cute.
mildlyinteresting,feo1ui4,t1_feo1ixp,1579294040.0,A lot of them travel via hopping trains. Just jump into a passing train car and off they go.
aww,fenaji9,t3_epz6ic,1579280532.0,"I’m so jealous, he’s not huffy at all! What a cutie pie."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fen66xb,t1_femyv5d,1579277853.0,"Exactly. He even said, ‘oh I know that wasn’t a good question to ask.’ 

They know what they’re doing. They want to test your boundaries, and see how far they can go. Was in the middle of blocking him when he sent me that military family members message...I couldn’t leave it. Hold it right there, Marine."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fen5lqx,t1_fen220s,1579277483.0,"Right? ‘Oh I know it’s not a good question to ask,’ and yet still asked anyway. He’s full of unadulterated rubbish."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fely7lr,t1_felxzvv,1579233964.0,"I’ll admit, his response put me into ‘incandescent’ category, so I did reply. It was interesting to me to see what the response would be (I’m new to standing up for myself like that against guys)."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fely51a,t1_felxzvv,1579233910.0,I don’t know if I can upload it in the thread? Maybe I’ll have to post to imgur or something.
FemaleDatingStrategy,felwb04,t1_felw896,1579232543.0,Oh he sent the most ridiculous justifications for asking while I was blocking him. Don’t worry; he’s blocked.
FemaleDatingStrategy,felvmfn,t1_felvlwd,1579232056.0,With a quickness.
FemaleDatingStrategy,felvat0,t1_felv83l,1579231820.0,"I flipped on him; now he’s apologizing. Stop texting, bud, I’m trying to block you."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fek8c2c,t1_fej6g9h,1579194717.0,Good! Sounds like an acquaintance; an orbiter. Don’t be *anyone’s* second choice.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fejrmso,t1_fejgoyz,1579184129.0,"Right? All you’d have to do is put up a profile with ‘not looking for anything serious; only here for physical’ and you’d be buried in an avalanche of messages. 

It’s overwhelming on OLD as it is, let alone if you advertised looking for something casual."
FemaleDatingStrategy,feiiah7,t1_feii7f1,1579139173.0,"Called a dude out on being snippy and rude, and decided to wait for him to text me back. It’s been three days. Boy, bye. 

If they want you, they’ll put the effort in."
TwoXChromosomes,fehyeg5,t1_fegyv12,1579126366.0,"Have rescued many animals out of puppy mills, and horses from meat auctions. The majority of the worse rehabilitations and rescues I’ve worked on have come from Amish country. The other 10% are hoarding cases. 

It has totally changed my outlook on them as a people. I only hope the people who want out can escape that horror; any culture who can treat animals that cruelly cannot be a pleasant place to live."
Equestrian,fehxakc,t3_ep26fk,1579125707.0,Those irons are almost as cute as that little face! What a sweet pony.
