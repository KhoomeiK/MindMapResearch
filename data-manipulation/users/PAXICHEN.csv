Munich,ffhhcam,t1_fffrzyw,1579935263.0,"They were $25 per pack in AUS when I was last there. A year earlier they were $3.50 in Japan when I was there. In Boston they were $8 and would assume they were around $7 in Germany at the same time.

That said, I’ve been in Munich for 3.5 years and have been back to the USA twice since and the smoking rates in the USA **appear** to me to be a lot lower. Things I didn’t see that I see in Germany are people pushing their baby carriages while smoking; smoking while sitting with their kids. Sure, this was very common in the USA 20-plus years ago.

So, price alone doesn’t drive the drop in smoking rates, but it sure as hell doesn’t raise them."
