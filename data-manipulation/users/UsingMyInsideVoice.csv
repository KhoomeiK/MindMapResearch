IWantToLearn,femqnsj,t3_epxjqu,1579266782.0,"I ""acted as if"" for many years while I had to be in the workforce. No matter what my job was it included interacting with customers, clients, or children and their parents. I became very good at interacting with others, even tolerating small talk and off-topic conversations. I became comfortable with it most of the time and enjoyed the freedom to feel like I was part of the group, but I would arrive home wiped out each evening, not from the physical activity of the day, but from having to be ""on"" all day long with people.

Practice makes closer to perfect. You can prepare all you want but unless you actually make yourself do it, you won't get better at it or more comfortable with it. Start in smaller doses if you can - short amounts of time, fewer people - and gradually increase to stretch your comfort zone. Be prepared to be tense and tired afterward and plan some self-care to decompress. Keep in practice. I haven't been in the workforce for 14 years, now, and have lost most of the interaction skills I developed (plus I'm that much older and much less willing to put up with things I don't like).

You can do this. You can make friends and have friends. I always found it was helpful to have at least one extroverted friend who could kind of take on the burden if I found myself fading at a lengthy social or networking event. Having this extroverted friend also meant that I was invited to be in situations more often where I had to interact and I would meet a wider variety of people, some of whom also became friends. It's sometimes unpleasant to make ourselves grow in new ways, but it is usually quite worth it. Best wishes!"

I did try the thing where you run your knife under water frequently and it does help some, but I am still having to buy pre-cut onions or have the hubster do the onion-cutting duties (and he doesn't do it right!)."

IWantToLearn,fe500ob,t3_ennjj7,1578864401.0,"I give my full attention to my kids (now adults), husband, and mother when they talk to me about something I don't give a flip about. (1) It's polite. Sometimes, you want them to listen to you even when you know they aren't particularly interested; (2) If that person is important to you, then you should be aware of and know at least a little about the things that interest them; (3) If you listen to kids (or anyone) about the ""little"" things then they are more likely to talk to you about the big things that come up. Keep in mind that you are listening and responding to strengthen your relationship with that person. Relationships are made of give and take and listening to things you don't care anything about is part of your giving."
AskReddit,fe4xmmp,t3_ennslu,1578863794.0,"You can't make everyone happy, so don't try. Do what is the best thing for you and let others' comments about roll off of you. If you have a spouse/life partner, they should have some input. Otherwise, it's really no one else's business. Not even your mother's...really.

I also (1) have to sing the old Oscar Mayer Bologna song to spell ""bologna""; (2) have to pronounce February and Wednesday like they look in order to spell them right; (3) sing the alphabet song to look for things alphabetically; (4) have to say the poem about the total days in the months to figure out if we are in a 30 or 31 days month, and (5) keep track of U.S. election years, leap years, and 4-year Olympic games by remembering that they all happen in the same years."
Catahoula,fe3xx9z,t1_fe3dh23,1578853900.0,About a year ago she went from going 100 mph the whole time she was awake to sleeping most hours of the day and only wanting to go out to use the bathroom. She aged really fast. I've had her to the vet for testing and he says she's still healthy just relaxing.
Pets,fe27m5b,t3_enn863,1578835347.0,"My cat does this a couple of times a day. He's playing. It's kind of disconcerting, though, when he's doing parkour through the living room and peels off from my leg leaving painful scratches behind. He doesn't mean to; he's just being silly. But it still hurts.

Sometimes he looks at me or the dog like he's going to attack, but then he thinks better of it (he's had negative feedback when he's done that in the past)."
