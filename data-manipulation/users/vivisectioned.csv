AskMenOver30,ffhnfuo,t1_ffhbiwt,1579943819.0,"Yes he is breaking the noise law but he is quite tricky that he doesn’t do it constantly, but with pauses in between. So it’s not easy for us to send complaints to the police because they do lower their voices after a period of loud yelling.

This is not an everyday occurrence fortunately, but quite often for the past few months since he started to stay at home more (maybe working from home, idk)."

CPTSD,ffdmt19,t1_ffdlyds,1579824221.0,"then you're not really over-sharing. you just don't have the right support for now. 

one of the things i like from this sub is it helped me find out ways where i can polish and practice my skills to be a less limited person and a more able-to-respond person. 

i read a lot of good informative books and sources that made me understand what c-ptsd entails, and where to find good therapists that know how to deal with clients that have it.

from there, if i'm still in no luck to find one in my area, i will approach online therapists that do pro-bono. and somehow i found one or twice in the past. 

i think if you dig deeper, you will also find what you need. good luck."
CPTSD,ffdl20t,t3_eszs4s,1579823143.0,"a good listener wouldn't mind this, but if you, like most of us, not in luck to find any around, then a therapist would usually be there to listen and put a mirror (figuratively) so we can see our blind spots and help us reflect.

btw, it's a natural behaviour. just need help to practice to be aware so we catch ourselves from doing it too often."

But the wild animals in the continents/islands that run away from humans were naturally designed due to their history of the dangers interacting with humans (and other species for that matter).

I prefer to see them react naturally, if they go against their instinct, it means they do it to survive, because their natural habitat is not safe or available anymore."
