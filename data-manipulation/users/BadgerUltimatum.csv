Horrible Idea, it was immediately a foot above our head, we couldnt see and could only breath by waving our hands around like crazy and jumping up above the foam. 

Running away from it wouldn't have been a problem except this beach has spiky rocks and since we had braced for impact with the wave of foam which provided no resistance we were disoriented. We did make it out but shortly after an intense itching developed and we ran back to our accommodation and jumped in the pool to scrub it off.

Realise that your apathy can be weaponised, you're going to kill yourself anyway may as well see what the world has to offer. 



Know english, congrats you can teach kids in a foreign country in exchange for a room, board and food, and you still get paid. 


Are you white ?  congratulations some foreign businesses will hire you just to show they have white people, you'll be paraded around at meetings and in many cases just need to be present and willing to talk. 


There are plenty of communes around the world that would take you and allow you to live amongst them if you chip in labour. Nice clean living away from everyone and everything that's bringing you down. 


This one's at the end of the list because it's not really a great continued living option but if you're already suicidal start abusing that fact. 

Become a smuggler and start saving to flee to a country with a low cost of living and live like a king. If you get caught well you were intending to die soon anyway."

If you're sad know that nothing is permanent and things will change. A man that knows things can get worse can live to cherish little moments.


If you're in a good place, hug yourself and have a cry because it will end, it might last a lifetime but the only sure thing In this world is that one day we leave it all behind.

If that flower was tested as a concentrate it is already 130% above the newly introduced limit before any processing has been done. 


Now your extract needs to be 90% inactive ingredients, considering even mid range dispo weed can be 14% thc, extracts will now be less effective than flower in every way and introduce God knows what to suspend or dilute the active compounds 


Essentially concentrates are a more processed  form of cannabis, removing all the plant matter which just creates smoke for your lungs to breath means people with diminished lung capacity previously  restricted to edibles can now vape (dry herb, oil or vape cartridges).

Consider all the shit in your house or apartment, what percentage are secrets or would change how people view you, who would be the one to clear your place after death, do you own your residence, wouldn't the person clearing your place either not know you or love you enough not to sully your memory with pointless crap after you've passed. Even then often after shit does come out people tend to rmeber the good times instead of the the one horrible fact they heard once shortly after your death.

I don't use any shampoo or conditioner, this takes a few weeks before your hair gets used to it again, I'll use S&C before a haircut or if I'm really dirty.
