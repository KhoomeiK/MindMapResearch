AskReddit,fcy77pc,t3_ejdlbw,1578075815.0,"This girl and I were from similar backgrounds (Tragic childhoods... blah blah blah). We were friends for years. We went to middle and then high school together. We were both outcasts, not really wanting to be part of any group. Well, in about the middle of 2nd semester of freshman year, she fell into a group of people that openly disliked me. However, she and I maintained contact and our friendship endured. Although, we were developing different interests, we still found time for each other. We visited each other all the time. My parents even invited her to spend summer break and my 16th birthday with us at a beach house. It was two weeks of fun and sun and... boys ( and, in my case, girls + boys).   Aside from a spat or two (IDR about what), we never had a fight. She was always very awkward and introverted while I became more outgoing and charismatic. I became a cheerleader and she sort of receded from everyone. I wanted to encourage her to be more open but, she never did. Eventually, I realised that she was always asking me for money when we would go out. As she was from a poor background, I didn't mind helping her out. Fast forward to Junior year and we were still friends. She had come with me to my grandparents' beach house for summer break for the past 3 summers and it had been glorious fun. I continued funding our trips though, I was more aware of the spending. The group she had fallen into our freshman year were still openly disdainful of me. They bullied me for becoming a cheerleader. They bullied her for being friends with one. She stopped talking to me so much and would not come to my house anymore. This was my only friend. I was devastated. She told me that we could still be friends but, we couldn't talk around her other friends. This crushed me. She had chosen her rude, hateful, non-accepting group over me. I cried for days. I fell into a heavy depression. I was kicked from the cheer squad for "" not being active at tryouts"" though, I was present at all of them. I think I must have died because, I changed completely after that. Fast forward again about 3 years and she got in contact with me via Facebook. I had just moved in with my boyfriend of two years and we were happy. I told her this and she insisted that we rekindle our friendship as she had a long-term boyfriend, too. 

  I chose to forgive her but, I still pressed on with caution. We met up a few times and I guess the nostalgia caught me up because, I really enjoyed having her back in my life. I still didn't have many friends though, I was very much outgoing and energetic. She ended up getting pregnant and the moment she did, her romantic situation turned very sour. He became controlling and possessive, not even allowing her to shave her legs for work. I tried to help her and she turned me down. She came to me telling me she had cheated on him and she wanted my help. She pushed me away when I told her I could not help her financially as we were trying to buy a house. Again, I was hurt. I saw everything at that point. She had kept me around for my funds. I cut ties with her completely. She took to calling my mother (who is forgiving and kind to a fault) and asking her for money to which my dad quickly responded with ""get a job"". About a year later, she got a divorce and gave up custody of their son because, she didn't ""want to go through all the legal shit"" to keep him/ get him back. She then married another abuser and got pregnant by him with the same result. She called me asking for a place to stay about 3 years ago and I ( yes I Know) let her. She was here for 4 months with no job and barely looking. 

  Here's where it ends: She asked if her dog could come too about 2 months in and I (a person who adores animals of any kind/ size) let her bring him. I had a cat at the time and she had told me that her dog was great with cats citing that she had had some at her old place. I got a call at work one night from my husband who told me that my cat had been severely injured by said dog and that I needed to come home now. I did so and we took my cat to the vet clinic where, they could do nothing for him and had to put him down (RIP Smaug). We came home after calling her several times. She finally came back and after trying to victimize my cat, told me to ""Just get a new cat!"" I was so angry. All of the rage and injustice boiled over and I blew up. I told her she had one week to ""Get the fuck out of my house!"" She was gone eventually but, she posted all over the place about how I made her put her dog down. Note: I would never ask such a thing. I don't blame the dog. I blame her. They should put her down.  


TLDR: Girl who I thought was my friend in school used me to fund holidays and trips. Then, her dog killed my cat."
