If they signed an opt-out letter that details the crunch period, the workers right to cancel it whenever they want and their compensation. 
Nothing.  

They would be violating nothing, as there are exceptions to allow for crunch.
But it has to be agreed upon by both parties, it cannot be forced upon an employee.


>	Not everybody can get a promotion in a company so those—in the pool of crunchers that worked more—probably have all kinds of other positive points that put them in a better light than those that chose not to crunch. Then you can’t point at crunch being 100% the reason for you getting overlooked. That way unambiguous evidence becomes harder to find.


In that case you aren't disfavored or treated negatively. It is specifically about being treated harshly (getting more work, losing benefits, pay etc) not akut losing out on promotions."

>	I can bet that they broke this law, I’ve worked at a company that broke this law. They simply asked us to work overtime, I refused, some people agreed and worked 10 hours a day 6 days a week, some even worked 7 days a week. They got paid for their overtime, everyone was fine with it. 

You didn't read all of the wtd them. There is a section about opt-out, that gives employers the option to have employees sign an opt-out contract that specifies clearly how long, their compensation and their right that they can withdraw from it whenever they want.

So it was only illegal if they didn't sign an opt-out letter.

And it wouldn't be your employee that got fined if you illegally worked overtime. It would be your employee because they have the responsibility to make sure you follow your working hours."
Games,fempngs,t1_fempgxy,1579265862.0,"You missed the important part of thst rule stating thst it is the average over a monthly period. So it might be 60 hours one week. But be under 48 hours average over a 4, 6, 8 or 10 month period.

But the first step is always on you as the employee, you have to report it as soon as you can, or it will just become harder and harder to help you.

>	That they know of. Company politics can also happen through unofficial channels and then you are lacking evidence. 

If you know it happens in other ways, that is proof that not only are they violating the wtd, but also other laws if it's not properly reported to the proper tax authority as company expense etc.
