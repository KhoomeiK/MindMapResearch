Regardless, Trump sold out his base long ago, because he did the exact opposite of everything he promised them. He's 100% establishment now. He did the exact opposite of draining the swamp. No wonder establishment Republicans love him at this point. It's common sense really. 

If Sanders sold out to become another Hillary or Biden or Obama after getting elected, the corporate establishment Dems will love him too.

Same thing happened to Sanders in 2016, alongside  Hillary's people colluding with the DNC and CNN to screw him. They're trying again in 2020 as expected, but Sanders has a hell of a lot more support this time. They might begrudgingly nominate him the same as the RNC did for Trump in 2016."

America sucks at taking anything but baby steps toward the right side of history, and it's always been that way. It was no different from the founders having to fight for a constitution and a federalist government, to civil war era politicians fighting to limit and gradually remove slavery, to politicians dragging their feet for women's right to vote, to the same thing happening during the civil rights era, to gay rights and marijuana decriminalization in modern times. It's never ending.

Sanders is just the first baby step imo. Hopefully, he can move America's political spectrum back to the left where it historically was before Reagan dragged everything to the far right in the 80s. It's telling when every Republican before Reagan would've been considered a Democrat in today's America, with Richard Nixon being a radical leftist compared to Trump. He created the EPA and championed healthcare reform as a Republican back then, as shady as he was. When Nixon looks like a progressive democrat compared to the neolib centrists that run the DNC today, it should tell people how far America has fallen."
JoeRogan,ffj9br3,t1_ffj675r,1579993486.0,"It doesnt matter. That's my point. This is bigger than just policy right now. Sanders winning the presidency is basically a vote of no confidence in the current system. Trump was the rightist's version of that in 2016, but instead of draining the swamp, he doubled the size of it. This is the left's turn to make that choice, and if it doesn't happen now, I dont see it happening for a long time to come. The pendulum only swings this far during very irregular election environments, so wasting it is a big mistake imo. I don't want to be stuck with another long line of Clinton's and Bush's for the next 2 decades. Do you?"
JoeRogan,ffj8ga1,t1_ffj6ru1,1579992939.0,"All of my hopes arent attached to him, but my only hope for change anytime soon definitely is. That's nowhere near the same as Trump's random stupid sayings. I'm a realist, not an idealist, and realistically, the only chance any change happens whatsoever in the next 4 years (and likely the next 12 at least) comes by Sanders winning the DNC nomination and then the presidency. If he isnt voted in, no future candidate will run on a progressive platform for a long, long time, because the American people will have made their referendum on the only thing they will vote for, and that's the status quo. 

Believe what you will, but nihilism serves nobody, and you're not paying attention to historical examples if you believe another status quo candidate winning won't halt all possibility of change for many election cycles to come. Change only happens when the public demands it in overwhelming numbers, and any change you'd like to see in the future by other candidates is predicated on voting for change right now. Either you set a precedent to let the powers that be know they have no choice, or you let them continue as is in perpetuity. It doesnt mean massive changes will magically go through just by electing Sanders, but not electing him shows a powerful message that the American public is not a threat, and the powers that be can safely ignore us for at least another generation."

The stock market crashed in 1929, which set off the first big domino. Banks were giving out ridiculously bad loans at the time for stock market investors, so when they all failed, these banks failed. After the banks started to fail (around 9000 in the US alone), and since there was no FDIC insurance on accounts, it wiped many people out completely. This caused mass panic, making everyone take their money out of the remaining banks, causing even more to fail. This caused the banks still standing to be unwilling to offer any new loans to anyone, causing massive stagnation and halting job growth. These massive economic issues then caused people from all classes of wealth to stop purchasing anything but absolute necessites out of fear, therefore stagnating the economy further, causing further job loss and even less expenditure. The loss of spending on such a mass scale caused business after business to fail in succession, furthering job loss to compound the problem, and forcing the US government to pass the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which caused a global trade war and global economic retaliation across the board. On top of all this, things like the great Dust Bowl were happening at the same time, causing farmers to lose everything too. 

The biggest reason the great depression ended was the world war, because war economies cause massive boosts in production and job growth, and many former unemployed workers were either sent to war or employed at local factories. It completely reversed all the former economic dominoes that had fallen and compounded on top of each other. Essentially though, war economies are socialist economies. Capitalism crashed across the globe, and the only fix was limited socialist policies introduced by people like FDR. Frankly though, FDR had no choice, and the New Deal was a compromise to get the American people from going into a full socialist revolution. It was extremely close to happening at the time. The world economy was that bad."
JoeRogan,ffj5g8m,t1_ffj3tk7,1579990875.0,"Sanders is not Obama. Not by a long shot. Either way though, he's the only chance whatsoever that things might change for the better. Trump sure as hell wont be helping anyone but himself and the highest bidder, and Biden and co are all boomer versions of Obama. Sanders is pretty clearly the best possible choice this election cycle. 

Change never, ever happens by voting in moderates, and it will never happen in the future if people are unwilling to vote progressive candidates when they come around. If Sanders loses, then there will be no future progressive candidates for many, many elections to come, and nothing at all will have changed through that entire time. America will be in a very bad place if that's the timeline we take, and I'm not sure how it will get resolved peacefully when all peaceful options of change are rejected."

I literally responded to your exact argument. You simply missed the point. Pro athletes are not average men and women, so that alone refutes what you said, and all data points to the fact that peak men will almost always beat peak women in any sport, even though both are equally trained. 

The only time women stand a chance in general is in extremely long endurance events. The longer a race is, the higher chance women have of winning, but MMA is not long-distance swimming across the English channel. People can die when drastically mismatched.

In the best women's Olympic event (swimming), the recent  women's records match that of what men achieved in the 1960s. They're literally 60 years behind the men. 

You may say that women could beat an average man, and this is true, but athletes in pro sports are not average men and women. These are people at their peak, and it's been proven over and over again that men naturally dominate women when measuring their peaks side by side.

It's also not true at all, and generations of real world data data backs it up. Just look at all the records in every single athletic Olympic event there is.

Women can only peak out at 90% of a man's performance, and even then, they're 40 years behind men in all cases.

What are Yang's politices on university tuition and healthcare reform? Tuition reform will affect every generation 40 and under, while healthcare reform affects absolutely everyone. Both are major issues that need to be fixed, and UBI doesnt do it. With automation coming, we need people to all be educated, since menial jobs will eventually disappear, and $12,000/year UBI isnt enough money to keep uneducated workers afloat. 

The cost of getting a higher education is far too high, and 1 million people are going into default every single year, with the tuition debt having tripled over the past decade. It's unsustainable and needs to be fixed right now, not later, since it is a problem that gets increasingly worse every single year. Is Yang going to fix this or not? $12,000 is just a welfare check given to all, which is fine, but tuition costs are far higher than that, and better education is the only path for anyone to eventually be fulfilled in their careers.

I dont disagree with you about any of the criticisms you've listed, because they're all fair and accurate. I don't really have much to say against it except that the entire world seemed to have trended into a more nationalist, far right-wing populist mindset over the past decade. I mean just off the top of my head, there's Trump in America, Boris/Brexit in UK, Modi in India, Orban in Hungary, Erdogan in Turkey, Abe in Japan, Dutarte in the Phillipines, Morrison in Australia, Netanyahu in Israel, Jensen in Norway, and Kaczynski in Poland all currently in power, with people like Le Pen in France and the Alternative for Germany party in Germany all gaining more and more support as time goes on. Most of the 'free' world (which is why im not including Putin or Jinping) seems prey to far-right populism right now, with many countries only realizing their mistake after they've already elected these politicians. Turkey is no different there. Istanbul showed a pretty strong about face when it elected Imamoglu not too long ago, so who knows if things will eventually change.

That all said, I still understand where many Turks are coming from. Turkey absolutely has been singled-out in many cases. Even now, you listed all those criticisms about Turkey, yet half the world went the same direction, albeit in their own way culturally. Is Turkey really that different from them? I dont think they are. I mean look at the clickbait thread we are in about the Turkish coast guard being 'mean' to refugees/migrants.

watchpeoplesurvive,ff3qrbo,t1_ff3lkh1,1579546826.0,"I never said it wasnt a genocide. I believe it absolutely was. What I did say in another post though was that it's far more nuanced than what most people want to accept. I understand the point of view of the Turks who feel insulted by it, because it not a white and black thing. 

The popular idea for 'genocide' is the Holocaust, where there's a very clear, divided line between the victims and murderers, the good and evil, guilty and innocent. That's not the Armenian genocide at all though. Armenians guerillas committed atrocities during that period against the Turks/Ottomans too. Many joined the Russians in 1915 to attack the Ottomans, slaughtering villages and murdering innocents, so there absolutely was guilt on the Armenian side. Armenia however refuses to admit they ever did anything at all, which is absolutely false. Turkey seems to say 'but they started it!' as a way to justify their wrongs. Both are like children pointing fingers about it. Both seem to be unable to accept that atrocities can be committed by each group while still being victims to it. They're not mutually exclusive, but since the holocaust was, popular opinion makes people believe it always is. So telling the Turks that they committed genocide is giving them one black and white choice: either accept that their ancestors were wholesale evil people, or deny it happened at all. It's not much of a choice in that instance. Every nation of people puff themselves up to make themselves feel better, and Turkey is no different. 

Also, since I've been here in Turkey over the past year, I could see how reddit and western mainstream media in general seems to be wholesale against Turkey on this and every other issue in a biased way. The armenian genocide is constantly mentioned, yet nobody seems to care about how Japan still denies it's countless atrocities all over Asia between WW1 and WW2, most of Europe's culpability and indifference to the jewish holocaust, etc. Even America for many, many generations said 'the indians killed us too!' as the justification for what happened to the native american people, and nobody cared to call it genocide until nearly 100+ years later. They didnt call it such even in 1920, when the word was originally created to describe the armenian genocide. The biggest difference seems to be the Ottomans were majority Muslim, and the Armenians were Christian.

The bias in all of it is obvious to me, and I'm a non-Muslim American. If I can see it, then I dont know why others can't. Seeing how nationalist Turkey seems to be in general, it doesnt surprise me that they dont take it very well. It's similar in my view to how plenty of southern American states teach school kids that the civil war was about state rights, not slavery. Denying atrocities is absolutely not just a Turkish thing, but they seem to get most of the world's criticism, on the internet at least."

In fact, a few said they dont even support the HDP, because that party supports the PKK/YPG, which kidnaps Kurdish kids near the Syrian border and forces them into joining. Every other Turkish person I've met pretty much says nobody cares, and that the majority of Kurds actually support Erdogan, because they relate to the religious stuff more than the racial crap. 

If the Armenian genocide is part of Turkish history, then it's also a part of history for every nation formerly under the Ottoman empire, meaning the balkan nations, Greece, nearly the entire middle east, etc. I guess every one of those nations need to admit they genocided Armenians, because they were all a part of the Ottoman empire, and all of those nations had people serve in the Ottoman military.

Turkey being the successor state means absolutely nothing, similar to Lombardy being the successor to Rome means absolutely nothing. The Ottoman empire was the successor state to Byzantium too, yet not a single person on earth credits Byzantium's accomplishments and crimes on the Ottomans.

Also, if you think the American revolution wasnt a total government overhaul, then you really have no idea what you're talking about. Going from a Monarchy to a Republic is a complete, wholesale change in governmental form. There's absolutely no better way to put it. It isn't a separatist movement, because a war was fought. Seperatism is better classified as a country still under the British commonwealth, such as Canada, who simply asked the queen to become their own governing nation. Revolution is not simply a 'separatist movement'. 

Turkey has no responsibility to recognize the genocide more than they have, because the political ramifications arent fair to their nation. They are not the Ottomans, no matter how you try to frame the narrative. No credible historian worth their salt would ever consider them such, and revolutionary governments arent responsible for the past government's failures. Revolutionary France wasnt responsible for whatever crimes Louis XVI committed anymore than the Soviets were responsible for what the Romanovs did. 

Regardless of all of this, I agree that it was a genocide, but I also understand that it was extremely nuanced. Most on reddit seem ignorant of history and don't even try to understand why things happened as they did, let alone why modern Turks feel as they do. The Armenians were doing terrible things to the Ottomans too, just not on such a mass scale. It's similar to many saying the modern PKK Kurds were another genocide, not acknowledging or understanding that the PKK is a literal terrorist group (listed as such by every developed nation  in the world) that's been suicide bombing Turks since the 1980s. There is nuance and it isnt a clean division between 'good side' and 'bad side' where one is innocent and the other guilty, which is the popular idea of what many consider genocide. Turkey denying it was a genocide is basically saying they see the entire affair as different from the Holocaust, and it absolutely was. The Holocaust was a clearly defined line between the murderers and victims, while the Armenian Genocide is not.

The problem ultimately lies with BOTH Turkey and Armenia, because neither accept the fact that atrocities can be committed while also being a victim of them. Armenia denies they ever did anything wrong, which is absolutely false, while Turkey justifies their wrongdoings by saying 'but they did it too!'. The fact is, until Armenia admits their atrocities, Turkey will never admit theirs, because it's a double standard that is ultimately unfair to everyone that suffered from both sides."

This could be a roach infested nightmare of a place with water damage everywhere, rotting floorboards, mold in the walls, you name it.

Meanwhile, worshipers of hers will claim shes the best driver that ever existed, while giving no proof whatsoever. That's just a bit rich, considering you claim my facts are incorrect.

The fact is, using the claim 'she's still driving, so obviously shes still mentally sound!' is ridiculous, considering she issues herself a license. Shes not your grandma who lost her license at the age of 80 due to not being safe on the road anymore. She could be the most unsafe driver in England and nobody can tell her no. Again, rules for thee, not for me."

Naming random exceptions to the rule doesnt do anything to change that. Steve Jobs was a quack frutarian that died due to it. I'm guessing Bill Gates is pretty healthy though. 

Thinking you solved the problem by telling people to save money is a bit ridiculous too. Poor people dont have money to save. Even in America, the supposed richest country in the world, around 40% of the population will be in extreme financial trouble if a $400 emergency came up. 40% of Americans would either need to sell things to come up with the money, or they'd not be able to pay it at all. These statistics came from a Fed study in 2018 btw. Now, tell those people to just save more. I'm sure that will to down well. 

Depending on income and responsibilities, most poor people cant afford proper nutrition when ramen noodles and cans of tuna are their staple meals. If you truly believe people can afford nutritious food while being poor, then you've never truly been poor in your life. Healthy food is extremely expensive, especially compared to the alternative. Telling people to save money they dont have, while simultaneously telling them to spend significantly more on food... yeah, that's not much of a solution at all."
