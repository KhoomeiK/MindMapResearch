worldnews,ffl3pfm,t1_ffkpzsj,1580034243.0,"I remember about 5-10 years ago in the US there was a scare of people putting HIV infected needles in gas pumps, so when you'd go to squeeze the handle, you'd get pricked.

Supposedly, it happened in one area which caused everyone to be on the lookout."

I don't think it's uncommon as most people think. Does it look out of place? Certainly."

However, I bet she was so worked up thinking about how not to die from this carnivorous monster that the thought never even crossed her mind and she didn't even process it.

They sold it well enough to her that even blantent rational giveaways weren't processed by her sub-conscious."

However, I'd tend to agree with you heh."

funny,fd8saf3,t1_fd8mnh4,1578222714.0,"Plus, it takes more will-power and control to withhold your temper and contain yourself, which makes you more of a man than to explode over something minor.

gaming,fcvbqpv,t1_fcv0c8e,1577998767.0,"Yea and on top of that you had no sweet raid tools like WoW offered. Had to manage that shit manult and more people too. It was crazy. I remeber spending 4-8 hours as a Wizard teleporting people to the closest zone and then getting everyone there, organizing groups, buffing everyone, then attempting your run."
