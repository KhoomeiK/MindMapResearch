Though I’m sure it felt weird because I had never used it before.  This is a great time to experiment with a new grip though so maybe I’ll try that.  One thing I wanted to ask is how much the positioning of the paper matters for using your shoulder.  Would it be beneficial to try drawing on something that held the paper at an angle?  Typically right now I just draw with the paper flat on a desk and since I’m pretty tall that tends to end up with me leaning over to reach the surface.

Before this I had barely picked up a pen in years as I am usually doing work or play on the computer.   I like to learn new things and I like to take that learning seriously.  I have probably completed about 100 pages of exercises in lesson 1 and I’m currently working on the 250 box challenge.  Sometimes I get pretty discouraged looking at the exercises posted on this sub.  Not only are many of them light years ahead of what mine look like, but basically every one of them has straighter lines than me.  I genuinely have focused hard in drawing from my shoulder, doing the various exercises with a focused mind and after a month in a whole exercise I hardly have a single line that looks truly straight.  Or an ellipse that doesn’t wobble.  My hand shakes when I hold it over the page sometimes and I have been trying to go as fast and confident as possible but my biggest struggle is that I just feel like I have almost no control.  Any advice?  Will someone buy me new robot hands?"
ArtFundamentals,ffdwxtu,t3_et1w8d,1579830973.0,"That looks super cool, and well executed overall.  The long and skinny thing is just your tops are long and your bottoms are not.  The further out from the bottom the top lines are the longer the lines to connect them must be and so the taller the boxes get.  That feels like terrible English but that’s pretty much the problem.  If you’re looking at an object like a box, and you start to rotate it away from you, the far side doesn’t get further away it gets closer.  As the boxes go out from the center they should get shorter on top not longer.  Again though, your lines, consistency and hashing are light years ahead of mine so kudos."

They all regulate the action of neurons in some way and while there are certainly correlations between low serotonin levels and depression the overall mechanisms of contentment, happiness, bliss or whatever don’t always have a one to one correlation with an increase in any of these neurotransmitters.

It seems to me like people with night schedules were selected for over time and beneficial to the group and then eventually we just abandoned them and said something around 8am to midnight is the norm and anybody who is more comfortable outside those hours is either lazy and constantly struggling in the mornings, or is relegated to low prestige low paying jobs for the most part.

I didn’t mean it to have a negative connotation but I did mean that they may be intentionally rotating between benefits in a way that maximizes the total money they can get over the longest period of time.  Many people might also consider collecting unemployment benefits while intentionally staying unemployed to be unethical or at least outside the scope of what those benefits were created for.  Also if they happen to be collecting unemployment and BAH at the same time that is a bit of a gray area.  Of course they may not be doing any of that, which is why I stated it as a possibility and didn’t mean it as any kind of accusation.  To tell the truth I would encourage any person to get as much as they can in any way they can from the services, benefits and entitlements they have access to.  Having served in the Navy myself for 6 years I am also pretty familiar with how you can get the most out of your benefits while in and when you get out.  I managed to get 2 degrees from the military and was making more money when I first got out then I was when I was in.
