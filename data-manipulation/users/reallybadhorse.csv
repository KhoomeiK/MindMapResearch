Coven, Murder House, Cult, Asylum, Hotel, Freak Show, Apocalypse, Roanoke

There is definitely a learning curve for new fathers. No, it’s not fair to us as mothers, but it’s the way it is. As a feminist I struggled so much with things not being “fair” at first. Then I realized that if I wanted to be happy/sane I needed to just handhold my boyfriend and help him through this first part. Now our son is seven months old and dad is absolutely killing it. He takes him to the park, runs errands, and does laundry while I’m at work. Then is happy to take him while I take a long soothing bath after work before we switch off.
