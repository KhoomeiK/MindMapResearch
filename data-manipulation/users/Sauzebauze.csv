TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffhpksp,t1_ffhgftz,1579947097.0,"Fair enough. 


I believe age is irrelevant for these things. Most killers start young. It’s a wiring thing. The environment merely concludes the evolution. I’ve read stories about kids who hurt animals as children but later become normals kids. I found the difference was a good family but something wired in these kids brains is wrong sometimes and that’s that. If they act on it, that’s it. Full stop. I’m for removal of people like this completely from society - but this is based on the crimes. Not the age. If a 12 year old murders her friend with her friends, as was the case I read some time ago, I feel nothing but the hope that these people are punished and swiftly removed from this plane of existence. 


Mature or not - it’s the capability to do these types of actions which is the factor for me. I don’t think people like that ever stop unless stopped. I don’t feel anything for these people except disgust. I could give a fuck about the brain. There are literally 1000000s of kids in the same Ages who don’t do these things. These kids grow up eventually and are just older kids like most adults. They don’t get magically smarter or more intelligent or different urges. Prisons and housing them for years is absolutely a waste of time in my mind. What’s the point. I appreciate what you think but the age doesn’t matter to me and that argument doesn’t hold much water when actually debated. There’s a reason we even have the ability to try kids as adults. That’s for people like this. Because of the crimes severity, not because of the child’s age.


Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t feel these people deserves chances for actions like that regardless of age."

I made a point to feel things but not identify with them as kid. Emotions are good and natural but also are only fleeting and can be misled. 


We all have this. Saying age is why you didn’t feel it is wrong. You weren’t there emotionally. There are people in their 50s who aren’t there emotionally. There are kids who are there emotionally. 


It’s silly to think everyone is on the same arc in terms of what they experience by certain ages. These generalizations are just wrong from the get go. 


I had parents who were addicts and had to raise my brothers when they were born and I was a very young man, I stayed out and didn’t see my family for days when they were of age I could leave them, I became my own person because I didn’t have many people to help I didn’t feel. I saw a void and I filled it. Independence was a learned necessity. 


I’m happy because of it. It made me strong. It made me where I am now where I am financially well off, have an amazing partner. And have been able to help my parents come to terms with the issues that prevented them from being my parents. We are happy today. Things are good. 


I hurt for a long time. But I decided pain isn’t bad. It’s only when you do nothing with it, that it’s bad. I was very mature as child, and have excelled in many ways, and many do not expect my background. I am grateful for that as I don’t know if I did it or maybe I was lucky to gain it or born with it, but understanding your emotions can come at any age - as long as you develop it. I really made it a point to focus on this because I identified a need for it."

It’s really not hard to see. Work for any IT company. You will find many, many Indians and similar originating individuals. I once spoke with the one Indian woman in my last org and she told me in private that because she was seen speaking with me, she received a talking to from the coworkers around (I don’t even know them). It’s a culture problem. Where I am now is similar in some ways but being a larger, international org, this culture is tolerated much less. 



You’ll find it if you look for it. My point is it’s the culture. If you are so insecure that you can’t allow your women to show themselves for fear of what will happen or they cannot speak with others of different nationalities? Yeah that’s severely internalized insecurity which has been embraced with a culture that has created a support structure it allow this insecurity to never be addressed. (You can’t wear this, because religion when really it’s because some dudes way back when wanted control and were insecure about control so they created this system). It’s all manipulation under the guise of religion which does make people feel happier but also costs them a lot in these cases. 


It was really funny when we got a Mexican intern and they thought she was Indian or whatever and then they asked me first “is she Indian?” And I said “I think Hispanic?” And then they didn’t give a shit. Because she didn’t ‘belong to this culture’ or whatever the unspoken understandings they have. I just like talking to people. 


Cult of personality is definitely a part of it. When you are uneducated, people like that are the most likely things to follow. Because they tell their followers what is best and what they need.

At the same time innocents are accidentally sentenced for others crimes, there are monsters who walk free for nothing despite it being clear they did it. It’s the the same coin but two different sides. None of these monsters should go free. Ever. They shouldn’t even be kept alive. I would rather less monsters walk free and the innocents who are scapegoated remains the same since it is either way currently, but at least in that case they have a potential chance to argue their defense since if they didn’t do it, there will be evidence of this. If there is severe ambiguity, sure. But that’s the usual case. And of the cases where someone is scapegoated, everyone knows full well there is usually an agenda at hand rather than hard evidence pointing at the innocent accused. 


What’s the point of having the death penalty if I’m more likely to die of old age or related complications instead of actually serving my sentence? None. It ceases to be as severe as the punishment was intended."

For the huge majority, yes their crimes are mistakes and they can move forward after paying their dues. For some crimes, they can not be deemed a mistake but rather it’s something wrong with this person which they and we are unable to fix. These are the people I am referring to."

UnresolvedMysteries,ff9mco1,t1_ff9hlfd,1579716010.0,But there are cases where it is absolutely clear who has acted and yet they live a long long while subsidized by everyone who lives a better life. This is what I believe is pointless and serves no use other than to increase the cost of the actions of those individuals on others.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff9cnmx,t1_ff9chz0,1579710004.0,"That I do not think is proportionate in every case. It’s also a straw man fallacy.


Steal someone’s food so they starve and die slowly? This is torture. Maybe yes in the scenario, maybe worse than losing a hand. I think it should be worse. 


Steal someone’s iPhone to sell because you are hungry or you need to feed someone else. Yeah. It’s shitty. I don’t think it’s right. But I don’t think it’s completely wrong either. I don’t think you should lose a hand for this."
UnresolvedMysteries,ff9bmtd,t1_ff98oik,1579709267.0,I mean why would that make us lost? It’s such a bullshit arbitrary pseudo holy thing to say. If we do it to them as punishment and to make examples of their behavior for others. maybe others wouldn’t do this?? We do it for a reason. They did it for no reason. Do you not see this distinction?
PublicFreakout,ff7ayd2,t1_fei5m5i,1579645048.0,How interesting of you to project yourself onto someone. I see that’s a strong theme for you.

Wow. Impressive how little can satisfy some people."
Futurology,ff7anik,t1_ff786qy,1579644781.0,I hope you know I was sarcastic. You couldn’t comprehend the basic metaphor I was using so I do really feel for you man. That shit is sad. Now the content of what you said? I’m not qualified to decipher that borderline mentally ill concoction of words.
Futurology,ff78smy,t1_ff78pbh,1579643379.0,Good input I’m sure you can see that you introduced no point or argument so it was by definition pointless :)
Futurology,ff78mp0,t1_ff78kbc,1579643283.0,I think almost every politician is the exact same as him. So relatively not. I think he is the same.
