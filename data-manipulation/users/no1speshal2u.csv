depression,ffflmqu,t1_fff9xn4,1579886623.0,"I have ADHD also. It's something we have to learn to live with. Medication helps, but slowing our screaming fast spinning minds enough to understand what to do next, is what I was referring to. No, you are not alone."
depression,fff2zlw,t3_et9p8q,1579874312.0,"First off, you ARE doing something. Talking about it, especially with random strangers, somehow makes a big difference because you get to physically SEE what's bothering you by telling people how you feel, and you have no connection to them so you don't have to worry what they think. Next, there is no such thing as controlling people like us.  I'm 45 and still have the same problems. All we can do is learn how to cope with it in a safe manner. 
If you want to talk about things more, I won't troll you, I won't make fun of you, and I will do what I can to help. Talking makes the difference."

SuicideWatch,ff5uz1a,t1_ff5t8pg,1579611163.0,"The reason I ask is primary school, and the bachelor's degree are painfully mind numbing. They teach you all this crap you'll never use but you get no choices. When you get to the master's degree it all changes. 

The master's takes all that useless information (you probably forgot by then) and shows how it is relevant to life and business. I always thought if I took the master's first I would have understood the bachelor's and primary school a lot more. 

I didn't go to university until I was in my 30s and I dropped out of primary school at ninth grade. So college was infinitely harder for me because I had no memory of grade school math. 

I have been suicidal my entire life. I have attempted suicide dozens of times and (obviously) failed. Each time I tried and failed I was in a worse place than I was before. I'm not telling you to make sure you do it right, I'm trying to tell you there is a lot more to life than where you're at right now. If I would have succeeded, my life would have been for naught and I would not have been able to experience the birth of my daughter, the first time I made more than $100k a year, my first car, motorcycle, the sex, fun, excitement...

I'm not going to tell you it gets better because it doesn't. It gets harder. But as you age you experience more, and THAT is worth it.

What helped me? Friends, distractions, life after school/work. I only had two friends growing up. I'm 45 now and still have only two or three friends. But, I started building, designing, and flying remote control airplanes and helicopters. You have a lot of life to live. If you were to ask me, I would say stay in school. It'll be easier. Pick up a hobby in the meantime. It will take your attention away from your feelings that are not making sense right now. 

If there is anything I can do, please feel free to AMA."
