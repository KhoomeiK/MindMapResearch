gaming,ff9bumb,t1_ff9a47w,1579709410.0,"Kids play video games. Even if they‚Äôre not your primary demographic, they‚Äôre gonna play, they‚Äôre gonna see loot boxes, and they‚Äôre gonna see pretty lights and fun sounds and nothing else. 


You‚Äôre basically saying people with a mental disorder (a gambling addiction) aren‚Äôt allowed to play certain games because they have loot boxes in them. NGL, that‚Äôs super fucked up.  You don‚Äôt blame someone else for having a heroin addiction, you blame the asshole that gives them (and keep giving them) the heroin. 


It‚Äôs 100% on the devs who make the lootboxes. They‚Äôre banking on having a few whales who are gonna spend thousands on the game, and children with access to their parents credit card not realizing what they‚Äôre doing. That‚Äôs the goal of lootboxes for the devs: Exploit children and people with a mental disorder.  (That‚Äôs why lootboxes are bad.)


Or we could just unlock everything via gameplay (like we used to). It‚Äôd make games more interesting as there‚Äôd be more concrete things to do once you play through the first time. It‚Äôd also make all of this bullshit go away."
gaming,ff99veh,t1_ff8yg2j,1579708158.0,"Why not just unlock certain items through gameplay with that character? It‚Äôs pretty shitty how you can only play 2 or 3 characters, then end up with a loot box for a voice line a skin and two emotes, all for characters you never use. If I play only Hanzo, I should be leveling up hanzo, and getting gear specific loot for ether specifically hanzo, or that can be used on anyone, that you can know for a fact you‚Äôll get. It also fixes duplicate items taking up space in your loot box. Like in risk of rain 2 you unlock both items every character can use, but also gear specifically for whoever you‚Äôre playing (as long as you complicate a challenge) 

Not to mention it tricks kids into gambling, and people who get sucked in spend thousands of dollars I‚Äôm on them.

I blame overwatch for the  normalization of lootboxes in video games, and EA for the virus like spread it took across the entire industry"

If you have gear in your bag/box that could be used to target an out of season fish when you accidentally catch out of season it could be an issue, and if a ~~game~~ wildlife warden as seen you cast and catch multiple out of season fish you‚Äôre gonna get a ticket no matter what.

cars,fcy2gz6,t3_ej97rn,1578073920.0,"Wheels and tires make the most difference in how your car drives.


Tires are the only point of contact your car has with the road, so a better tire will give you better grip, road feel, and noise, but less wear resistance.



Wheels are just as important. If you want 0-60 to go up, a set of lighter wheels is a no brainer. Wheels are rotating, so the g forces applied will make the wheel heavier the faster it spins. A general rule of thumb is to multiply each wheels weight by 10, then subtract the difference. Let‚Äôs say your stock wheels weigh in at 28 lbs each, and your new wheels come in at 18lbs each. That doesn‚Äôt seam like a huge difference, but when you add it all up, you‚Äôre losing roughly 400 lbs of rotational mass just by putting new wheels on"
