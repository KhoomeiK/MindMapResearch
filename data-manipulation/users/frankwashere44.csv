No it wouldn't. The vast majority of parents would, and already do, choose to send their children into a state education. Not everything you want to happen has to be coerced. 

>Children are neither property of the state nor their parents. They are human beings, with the rights that entails. I would argue this includes the right to an education on things their parents may not want them to know.

But that the state wants them to know? They're much more property of their parents than the state. As it should be. The state should step in to protect them from abuse. If children are human beings, then, to follow your rationale, they should have the right to choose? A ""right"" isn't something that the state forces on a human under threat of prosecution. It's something that humans have the option of using, generally. 

>Do we want children getting their political education from neo nazi parents? Do we want children getting their sex education from rampant homophobes? Do we want children getting their science education from flat earthers? I would hope the answer to all of these questions is no.

You can make plenty of arguments for the perniciousness of state education. It was essential in turning young men into eager martyrs in World War 1, for example. That war wouldn't have been possible without the propaganda centres of state education. What's being taught can easily be changed at any time.
