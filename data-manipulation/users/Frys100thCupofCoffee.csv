Borderlands,ffisouy,t1_ffimw15,1579981742.0,"> You know why? No moronic modifiers.

You know, I forgot about this and for the most part you're right. If they tweaked M1-M3 to be more like M4 without the negative modifiers that would at least make it consistent for builds.

> I can understand that some reward needs to be given to players that are playing at the maximum difficulty

Honestly for this, I think a player/weapon skin would suffice. Instead of gating certain guns, just offer a cosmetic ""achievement"" trophy. That way people could say they did the ridiculous insane-o difficulty and got their reward from it, and nothing is stopping them from continuing to do it for the love of the challenge, etc."
Borderlands,ffidbeb,t1_ffhw5ge,1579971153.0,"> I had a blast with my no anointments build (I could solo basically every content in m3 regardless of the modifiers) but I got stomped horribly as soon as I stepped up to m4.

That's because the jump to M4 is the biggest of all the other Mayhem levels. Going from M3 to M4 you only get +200% more loot chance, +25% more XP and actually get -25% cash and Eridium (for some weird reason). But you pay for all that by now having to deal with enemies having:

 * 700% more HP
 * 800% more shields
 * 800% more armor

Since, again, the bonuses are fairly negligible compared to the power spike on enemies for that jump, what's the real reason to play on M4? Pretty much just the M4-exclusive legendaries, and looking at those it seems like those were made just to help people survive M4 a little better.

The game seems to make more sense if you're just talking about M1-M3, but once you make that jump to M4 it's all about anointments and min-maxing to a degree that makes the whole game seem broken. 

Since the game feels pretty good on M3 or lower, I get the sense that M4 wasn't intended to be about providing a fair extension of the game difficulty levels that is in line with how they progressed previously, but rather providing a ridiculously hard ""top-end"" for people who simply like the challenge of it more than they care if it's lucrative or fair.

All that being said, they can't really expect people to NOT consider M4 the true end-game if they're going to put exclusive loot in there, which I think was their big mistake. If they allowed the current M4-exclusive items to drop in any difficulty mode I think people would stop caring (or care a LOT less) about how imbalanced M4 feels."

I think you have valid points, but in the meantime if you want to try a build that's so good it feels broken, try that one. I'm on M4 TVHM with a Maggie, Flakker, and Night Hawkin' with the 115% GM anoint and a Brainstormer with 75% weapon status and effect on ASE anoint (I don't have a better one) using that guy's build and I'm blowing everything up like I'm using a fuckin' Game Genie. It's ridiculous.

The Flakker, in particular, is egregious. I almost feel sorry for the baddies. Then I used pretty much his exact load-out for the rest (Transformer w/50% bonus elemental, Red F4ng cmod, Atom Balm Otto Idol) except for my grenade which is a cryo MIRV-tacular Hex I found that also gives 50% bonus cryo on ASE. The whole rotation is pop GB, shit all over everything, when GB ends switch to the Brainstormer and fire a few shots to reset GB, then repeat. 

Anyways, long story short, yeah FL4K needs other stuff tuned but that build is solid as a rock, imo. Hope it helps!"

You can also bounce it off the ground and they'll stay in sync, but it's possible for one of the grenades to hit something and it'll skew the alignment of the bar.

Then for reasons ~~I don't fully understand~~ in my edit below, if the laser connects with ~~any part of the~~ an enemy crit spot (""slices"" through them) a shitload of big crits are registered and then whatever you hit just explodes and dies.

I'm *still* not entirely sure how the mechanic of the laser is supposed to work but I get a sense that the grenade might be bugged (in an advantageous way). 

Sometimes I'll throw one, the laser connects, a number of ""CRIT"" texts pop up over the enemy, but seemingly nothing happens (this is on M4). But more often than not I'll throw one, the laser connects and whatever I just hit gets one-shot.

It uses gamma burst so just get your best rad gear on and have at it. I use a chameleon stop-gap, deathless otto idol, usually a quasar (because it's hilarious) or a rad hex grenade, then for weapons I just use whatever I like that has either/or built-in radiation or cryo damage, and the ""during gamma burst you get +65% radiation dmg"" anointments.
