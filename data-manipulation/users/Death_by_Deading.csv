bipolar,fdbrwcd,t1_fdbqivb,1578261099.0,Yeah thanks that's already a huge thing in our friendship already and we talk about literally everything he knows things about me that no one else does. But communication and honesty are going to get hard soon because I'm moving out of the town he's living in and neither of us are good at communication long distance. Any advice on how to stay honest in that situation?

bipolar,fdbpbkc,t3_ekj5e9,1578259781.0,"I haven't been diagnosed for that long but I've been dealing with it for a while and usually what helps me deal with depressive episodes is cognitive behavioral therapy, it gives me ways to cope with symptoms of the depression and keep my life in order. Also writing how you feel and what you're thinking really helps externalize the feelings."
