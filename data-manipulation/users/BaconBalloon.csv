AskAnAmerican,ff2xpop,t1_ff2tou8,1579527955.0,"I didn't grow up here, so I didn't experience this firsthand. According to my husband, his grandpa made a \*really\* good living farming. His dad made a really good living farming. Using the same ground that we have now, we couldn't even break even if we farmed full time. The cost of seed, fertilizer, and everything else you need to grow crops has gone up a lot. The cost of equipment has absolutely skyrocketed. Cost of living has definitely gone up. However, the money you get back from selling your crops has not gone up much. It's resulted in farmers trying to work harder, and harder, but making less and less. I can completely understand why no one would want that for their career! Especially starting out, with the cost of equipment. One of our tractors is a Farmall M. It's from the early 1940's. We can't afford a new tractor, so we use it still. We have to jump start it with the truck a lot, because there's something wrong with some part of it, and the battery dies frequently. But we make it work. You grew up in a rural area. I'm sure you understand the art of making things work. It's a true art form for farmers!

I'm going to guess that you have no idea what a farm auction is, so I'll explain: a lot of people bring equiptment they aren't using any more to the auction lot. Some examples are old tractor tires, cattle or hog feeders, excavators, manure spreaders, grain trucks, auger buggies, tractors, etc. The auctioneers sell it, and take a cut of the profit.

My girls are 13 and 11, and my son is 9. My 11 year old and 9 year old used to be thick as thieves, with the 13 year old as the loner. About a year ago, the 11 year old started drifting to wanting to spend more time with her older sister instead of her little brother.

I do my best to redirect him, and actually engage him in actual conversation, but nothing seems to help.

What was best for our family was for me to become a stay at home mom when I got married. So I am still learning how to become a mom while teaching them how to have one. And my husband had different rules, while they were in daycare while he worked long hours. So I feel like I'm making everything up as we go. 

Is an uphill battle sometimes. Most of the time, it feels like at times. And the absolutely crushing investment you are sinking into this battle may, or may not have visible returns.

It's still the right path, even if it's a rough one. These kids are worth investing in. Just like mine are."

HelpMeFind,fcmvpro,t3_ei1u57,1577794470.0,"Would you consider watching old shows? I never watched it when I was young, but my husband watched the A-team. It's on prime. All the violence is old school TV violence, like cars getting flipped, but the bad guys crawl out, acting dizzy. I actually love it. I also really enjoyed watching The Waltons. Both shows are on Prime."
insaneparents,fcmuoj8,t1_fclpujj,1577793129.0,">In all honesty, yes I do think 500 points with chores at these values could be an overreaction for something as insignificant as playing on the phone after curfew... 

The thing I hate about picture posts is the lack of context. For all we know, this is a repeat offender, who was given many chances, but the amount of points required to get out of trouble keeps going up. Constant disobedience needs to be handled, even if someone else says the crime wasn't that bad. 

In my house growing up, bedtime was sacred, and if you were caught doing anything after bedtime, there were steep consequences."

My church has had an ugly sweater party the last five years. My daughter won last year: I made her into a snow globe, with snowmen with the pastors'  faces on them. (she beat my ""cartilage in a hair tree"" sweater, even.) This year, things got crazy, and we ran out of time... So my daughter just put a mirror on her sweater. She got an honorable mention."

The wrong kind of antifreeze, and only oil they have left is in tiny containers, and you're not sure if it would ruin your vehicle or not. Came in for a beer run? Unfortunately they only sell nonalcoholic beer. In winter they sell hard plastic sandals. In summer they sell hats and scarves. The soft pretzels look amazing... Until you realize you can't eat the fake display ones. They sell gas, but whichever pump you go to first doesn't work. The icee machine isn't freezing the icees, and the soda fountain is all out of fizz."
