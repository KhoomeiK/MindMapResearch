DepressionRecovery,fekb5m2,t1_fek1kad,1579196378.0,i say them out loud or just focus really hard on it in my head
DepressionRecovery,fek0xc6,t3_epl5lu,1579190244.0,I do my own. I (try to) tell myself that Im pretty and smart every day on the way to class. I always do it before tests and quizzes and it really helps me.
relationship_advice,fehras0,t3_ep3f6t,1579122313.0,I read your original post and I honestly think it would be best for you to leave this relationship. He sounds manipulative. Why’s he making this whole situation about him and when it’s 100% about you? If what happened to you happened to me my boyfriend would do whatever I wanted/needed to help me heal. It sounds like your boyfriend is more focused on himself.
StonerProTips,fehdimv,t1_fehdg81,1579114318.0,It’s all the same tbh. Have fun on your trip!
StonerProTips,fehd3o3,t1_fehcuvt,1579114078.0,I really don’t think anyone is going to care. TSA has more to deal with than checking everyone’s mints and pills. I would just take them the way you would any other edible. I’ve never flown with edibles so I don’t know but this same question has been asked on this sub about a hundred times so I’d just search by keyword and read some responses on similar posts.
StonerProTips,fehcdzg,t1_fehc659,1579113667.0,"i’m not a lawyer and don’t live in a legal state so i don’t know, but to me you’re REALLY overthinking this. I would just throw them in an altoid container and call it a day. what on earth would possess them to check your mints?"
StonerProTips,fehbzh0,t1_fehbo4v,1579113431.0,"how’re you going to get caught? are they going to test the mints? do the mints say thc on them? what am i missing here? the only thing that could give you away is if they are in the original container that says thc. also, if you’re traveling to a non legal state it doesn’t matter if you have a card or not it’s still illegal."
StonerProTips,feh9zf3,t3_ep5cwo,1579112234.0,"Mints are even easier to hide than baked goods because I’m guessing they don’t smell the way baked goods do. Put them in an altoid tin or something. There’s no reason anyone would think they’re anything other than normal mints unless they’re in the original container, so if you’re “going to get caught” it would be because of that imo."
Healthyhooha,fegtdha,t3_ep0q0v,1579102094.0,"This is totally normal! For me, penetration, while pleasurable with a partner, isn’t fun by myself. I prefer using my vibrating dildo to rub my clit and surrounding area."
Art,fecfdpz,t3_eoee8y,1578972596.0,the shading is gorgeous! makes me excited for spring!
AmItheAsshole,fecf4tx,t1_fe8vhcd,1578972431.0,"You absolutely should go, even if it makes you the asshole because that’s honestly a once in a lifetime opportunity. Would you realistically ever get to go otherwise? Y’all haven’t even had a real honeymoon, it doesn’t sound like traveling is at the top of your wife’s to do list. And if a honeymoon matters to her so much why’d y’all have kids before you even got a chance to take one?"
AmItheAsshole,fecen88,t1_fecel17,1578972101.0,the way universities force us to go into debt just to treat us like children is absolutely mind boggling
morbidquestions,fece1an,t1_fecdjqw,1578971685.0,"1. I am absolutely a whore (not little tho I’m 5’10). 
2. I go to a state school because I don’t want to be in incredible debt for the same degree you can get anywhere. 
3. What would your girlfriend think if she saw your reddit post and comment history? I’m hoping she’s as miserable and mean as you are so you can be happy together. (if not send her my way so SOMEONE can show her what an orgasm is) 
4. I don’t know what a betabuxx is because I’m not a fucking incel."
morbidquestions,feccy9q,t1_feccpd7,1578971000.0,"Oh, ok well I think you’re a pathetic short little incel who will never know the touch of another human being. 

See it’s so much easier to be nice. Just typing that made me feel so bad. I hope you find God or whatever it takes for you to be nice to others."
AmItheAsshole,fecctgk,t3_eoaxo5,1578970921.0,YTA to them and yourself. You don’t have to throw two parties. You can have one party and then dinner with the other parent another day and they can switch off who comes to the actual party every year. There’s going to be plenty more birthday parties and other celebrations. Stop hosting two of every event. That’s beyond stressful and you really don’t have to do that. If they want to come that badly they can see each other and if not then they can come to a smaller separate celebration (dinner or brunch).

morbidquestions,fecc1dv,t1_fecbon4,1578970455.0,"you post rude comments for shock value in an attempt to get other users to interact with you. by interacting with you they validate you (im providing you with validation right now) you probably don’t even realize what you’re doing and what your true motives are but deep down inside you just want any form of attention. and i’m not purposefully pc, i just have empathy"
