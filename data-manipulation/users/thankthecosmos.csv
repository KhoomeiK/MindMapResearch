I realize sometimes that i start feeling things and I KNOW why, because of things I went through. I'm in a relationship with an amazing man, he's been extremely supportive and understands my struggles. I find myself questioning and doubting his feelings for me at times, like a part of me is just looking for a reason to say ""I KNEW YOU DIDN'T LOVE ME!"" I've come to understand that it stems from having been abandoned by my parents and growing up in the system? He will make a small comment which my brain will then go off the hinges and start thinking some crazy things. But luckily, i've learned to communicate these things. It's a bit embarrassing having to tell him sometimes the kind of things that pop in my head. But he gets it. I read him your reply, to which he said ""Amen."" lol GAHHH!!! I must admit i have gotten a lot better this past year. I was so bad at calling myself ""Dumb"" and ""stupid."" I suppressed things for such a long time and now they're resurfacing and i'm just trying to get through it. A MILLION TIMES THANK YOU, not just to you, but to everyone who has been commenting and rooting for a stranger."

GetMotivated,felhdff,t1_felere2,1579222206.0, I LOVE the feeling of making other people smile. I get lost in my head sometimes and I've learned to distract myself by doing what you just said. I love hearing people laugh and watching them smile. I've been lucky and have attracted some really great people in my life that keep me grounded. I really appreciate your kind words.
GetMotivated,feknl9k,t3_epjjl6,1579203781.0,"Damn. This literally made me cry just now. I needed this. I was recently asked.... ""who are you?"" I couldn't answer. Throughout my life I've been through some shit...like, damn... I'm constantly doubting and overthinking things.  I am a strong believer of the power of positive thinking but sometimes... the past is just too painful and I hold myself back. Depression sucks. Its quotes like these that bring me back. 

I AM STRONG. I AM SMART. I AM KIND HEARTED. I AM WHO I AM BECAUSE OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES ITS HARD, I AM GOING TO KEEP ON KEEPIN ON."
