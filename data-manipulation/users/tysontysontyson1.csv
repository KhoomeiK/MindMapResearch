Ask_Politics,fffzczw,t3_etejci,1579895108.0,"Caucasian is a derivation of Caucasoid. Much like Negroid would be for black people. Except, the term negros (which would be the closest analogue to caucasian) came to be perceived to have racist tones in the US, so a new term was created.. African Americans. (Which, in and of itself would seem to be problematic, as a lot of people from Africa aren’t black... but, it caught on, so it is what it is.)

No one seems to think the term Caucasian is racist, so there hasn’t been a need to adopt a new term for white people. Even if there were a need, European American probably wouldn’t work, as it doesn’t seem to cover all white people (not all whites descend from Europeans).

And then you have the ultimate issue which is that, technically, all humans descend from Africans... so, I guess we’re all African Americans? 

I don’t know. Race is a weird animal. It doesn’t follow strict rules, different cultures define it differently (if you want a real mindfuck, check out how race has historically been viewed in Brazil... it’s very different than how we view it in the US.)"

Ask_Politics,ffdbcv9,t3_esvu6o,1579817221.0,"I’m sure it’s way too complicated to address in a simple response, but my short answer is that left of center parties have, by definition, a progressive agenda. Meaning, it is the core goal of liberal parties to identify problems in the status quo of society and change them through government action. 

The primary fiscal beneficiaries of changes to the status quo are lower income voters, and so many of them vote for their own financial self interest. But, changing the social status quo as the moral universe’s arc bends towards justice is also the morally correct thing and most “rational” thing to do... So, the most educated voters tend to vote for what they consider to be the most reasonable position on social issues.

In short, lower income voters like the fiscal aspects of liberal policies. Highly educated people like the social aspects of liberal policies."

Then, I think they met a few people at Def Jux (Cannibal Ox and Aesop). And then somehow Cage got involved...

It kinda made sense to me back then, because they all made similar music and fit a niche in the scene at the time (hardcore backpacker battle rap).. Aesop is a bit of an outlier, but I didn’t think of him as a core guy that much.

It could just be that I found out about them at the same time I discovered underground/indie hip hop through Napster/etc. None of that stuff permeated out to Cali where I’m from before that.
