Each user icon on the screen has its own playback settings.  It made a huge difference in our household by hundreds of gigabytes."

depression,fesov87,t3_eqeoy9,1579367523.0,"This is a large part of it I believe. I also think that everyone has to watch every little thing they say as not to offend someone (even for things where people shouldn't take offense) so people can't express themselves like they used to. That, combined with how expensive everything is and how many people are just getting by, and worldwide instability is causing depression too."
