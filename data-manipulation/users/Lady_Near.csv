Well if you are obese, like you certainly are, there are lots of people who do not want to be with obese people because they don't want to spent the rest of their lives with someone they consider unattractive. Also, as stated before it was YOUR question.

The Bahn is shit. Sure it can be affordable with discount. There are only this many discounts in the first place because it is so expensive. Just compare it to neighboring countries.

Futurology,fehf8da,t1_fehehe9,1579115314.0,It is for one way tickets. You can't buy Ländertickets before 9.00 as well which is VERY OFTEN a problem. Just the other day I lost my student card and I considered paying the train but almost 60 euros to Bremen and back from Hannover is too much.
Futurology,fehf044,t1_fehe40e,1579115179.0,It was barely a hyperbole. One way trip from Hannover to Bremen is like 30€. It's really expensive especially in comparison to other countries. Same distance would've been like 20€ max in the Netherlands.
