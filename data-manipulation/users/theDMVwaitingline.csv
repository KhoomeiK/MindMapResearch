securityguards,fdqxnc0,t1_fdqvjqa,1578676270.0,Yeah the site I'm at now regularly has 16 hours. Dunno why they don't have the guard on site stay 4 hours and have the guard for the next shift come in 4 hours early. I've said it a thousand times cause it's a hassle for anyone to prepare food and stuff for 16 hour shifts regularly.
securityguards,fdqxd7v,t1_fdqwv8y,1578676143.0,Damnnnnn dude. 90 hours? Most I've ever clocked out in a week was 72. And that was in 7 days. I had an ex who left me for my best friend after 4 years. Decided to work 2 jobs. Security and bartending. I was never not busy. Sometimes ya just have to occupy your mind.

securityguards,fdigcd1,t3_eljsha,1578442276.0,"This is why I turned down 4 supervisor promotions cause I've been with my company for 5 years and I know how it is for you guys. It would only be a dollar or two more an hour, and all of the calling and scheduling is so annoying and stressful. Being responsible for everyone's actions. Supervisors are the ones who volunteer to get fingers pointed at when they actually do the most work. Also people are selfish and before they get hired have all the open availability, but once they get hired, they can't stay after and work on their days off because they're doing too much. I feel for u. Id go back to being a regular guard or try and get into corporate."
securityguards,fdif1wo,t1_fdieulo,1578441440.0,100%. One of my friends that got into corrections fucked up bad and got fired. Let's just say it's the real deal in terms of strict harsh environment. You have to be strong mentally to take criticism even when it's mostly just someone yelling at you and calling you a piece of shit.
securityguards,fdieaw4,t3_elj1p9,1578440958.0,"A lot of my friends used this job as experience to get into corrections, then into the police academy. Like 4 of my friends became cops. But they're so soft still lol"

securityguards,fclg2h4,t1_fcisc9c,1577746961.0,"Very true and I know very well how this company is. Corporate likes to harass employees trying to get people to cover shifts constantly if you don't have a primary site. And if you say you can't they want proof for your excuse. I'm only 22 and I've been with the company since I graduated high school and I used to get hammered with all of the OT but now that I'm the new guy on the site, and I actually need the $$ it's tough weighing the pros and cons cause no matter what these hours are inhumane."
securityguards,fclfr0p,t1_fck7uky,1577746753.0,"Ugh that would've been such a good thing to say. He just says all that to make me feel smaller and to submit to the shifts just so he doesn't have to do em. He is my boss but I've been with the company longer and I've been a supervisor before too. They all seem to think I'm just this kid who's new when I've worked at over 7 different sites. I refused a couple supervisor positions because I didn't want to commit the time to work when I had to commit to school. The pay wasn't worth it, and I would be responsible for much more."
securityguards,fcjmz88,t1_fcjbcw1,1577694536.0,"Good points man. It's funny actually cause the guy I replaced looked exactly like me. We're both Korean and the same age only a few days apart in birthdays. First Asian I've met since moving to a new state. But he was def a pushover and also he drove an hour and a half to get to work everyday so he wanted a way out eventually. I used to work at a bar in NY and also did security at this really nice office. I've worked a 32 hour shift before. 

When my boss called me today he said ""I got great news, can you work until 7am and another 16 tomorrow?"" I said idk that's a lot like I've already done my part I came in on both of my days off. Now 2 extra shifts on top of the ones I'm already doing?"" And he's like fine can you do one? Tomorrow? And I said yeah. He then lectures me on how hes busted out a million 16 hour shifts and one time a 24 hour. He knows I need money and need a car."
GooglePixel,fciq51d,t3_eh5wvs,1577667167.0,I've had every iPhone since the 4s. Which means I've never had a good battery. But my Pixel 3a gets me thru an entire day plus the next morning. Made the switch in May. Not going back.
securityguards,fcilr9b,t1_fcijihg,1577664687.0,"Thanks honestly but for now I gotta stick it out. I just moved states, and I've been with the company for 4 years and got transferred just so I'd keep my pay. Got heavy hitting bills. I'm not gonna make this money anywhere else until I get my degree. Especially for what I do here. Which is essentially nothing. I do a lot of homework and it's good but the hours are barbaric."
YouOnLifetime,fc7k9v2,t3_efsmov,1577510139.0,"Did anyone else die when Loves brother was talking to Joe and he was like ""I'd rather watch a cat massacre"" in his head but was like ""that sounds dope"" when he spoke. Hahahahaha I'm high."
