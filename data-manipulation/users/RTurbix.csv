Iam 18years old tho. And I have been struggeling with this for weeks. I have contemplated just blocking her or whatever. I was to weak to jsut stop responding. Her giving me attention was enough for my infatuation naive stupid ass to fall for her again. Thats why I did such a direct closure-move.
I done it already. I will stay true to my word. But I will thinks about your advice!

I wish you the best mate! Impressive that you can handle this so confidently Iam not yet able to. But iam on my way there I guess! :)"

ExNoContact,ff47zqa,t1_ff3m1xx,1579557529.0,I in fact blocked her tho. Because I need the distance. Its about me not her.
ExNoContact,ff3i1ka,t1_ff3ho89,1579541478.0,I think that would come of as mean. She goes into my grade. So I see her virtually everyday.

Vent,fesoutr,t1_fesopt7,1579367521.0,ask her for that advice :)
Vent,fesofx0,t1_fesnk2j,1579367409.0,I mean advice clothingwise etc.
Vent,feso9kb,t1_fesnzv2,1579367356.0,Thats not very nice. He feels insecure and wants advice. Just let him have it.
Vent,fesmrmi,t1_fesm3xr,1579366886.0,Its a game of statistics if you meet enough people! :) A face with less fat looks more manly. Do you have a sister or a female cousin? Maybe they know a few tricks :D
Vent,fesleno,t1_fesl4zr,1579366442.0,Its not going to take years. Maybe like one or y bit more. Its still attainable. How do you know that they wouldnt?
Vent,feskv8x,t1_fesk73m,1579366275.0,"Okay, improving some aspects of your body may change that tho! :) You can look quite decent judging by the selfie you linked! :D"
Vent,fesjk4p,t3_eqifyg,1579365858.0,"Iam a bisexual dude so maybe I can just share some observations.(english is not my native language) 

The wheight can be taken care of by diet and exercise. This is of course easier said than done. Maybe contacting a professional like a personal trainer or dietitian could help :)

You could try contact lenses, your third pictures looks quite decent! :)

The height is something you cannot change. Will it be a dealbreaker for some girls? Yes absolutly! Should you give a damn? No! Because people do not decide what they are into or not. Rejections are never ever personal. They hurt tho and thats ok you will move on eventually.

Do you go clubbing? You can just talk to girls there. You Dont know them and they dont know you. Just talk to them have a blast und learn! :D Enjoying yourself is the most important part! :)

I wish you the best bro! The third picture (the selfie) proofs you can look quite good! Have fun improving! Failure is the way to succes, only not trying is problematic! :)"

I usually get quite good grades for presentations.
