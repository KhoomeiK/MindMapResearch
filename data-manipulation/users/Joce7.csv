BeautyBoxes,fg1gcr5,t3_ewb993,1580426604.0,"I had the caolion pore pack and just finished it off.

I really liked the steam pore pack, it was warming and didn’t make my skin tight and dry 
The cooling pore pack was OK for me, kind of strong menthol and the cooling was intense.

Hope you like them!"
