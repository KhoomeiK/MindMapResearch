I didn't say it was a better shot form. I just am saying if you're taller than the opposition, it's more useful than if you are shorter. It requires more strength and gives less transfer of momentum so you sacrifice a lot of range which is why most people with a deadly two motion shot were way better in the mid range than further back (Kobe, Jordan, Livingston, Kawhi to name some)
