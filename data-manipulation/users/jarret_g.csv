What's most likely happening is your microbiome isn't prepared for the fiber and can't digest it properly. 

I wouldn't suggest a probiotic because it's basically like mono-cropping your microbiome, but I take Seed synbiotic and while it's only been a month I am noticing some subtle changes.

The key, for me at least, is not to jump into it and realize that short term effects aren't indicative of long term benefits from a continuous high fiber diet. 

I really like smoothies and adding in some oats for more calories so it's not just 100-150 calories of veggies.

The diet limits or eliminates exposure to animal fats, certain cuts and types of meats, gluten, maltodextrins, xantham gum, emulsifiers, sulfites and certain monosaccharides.

Look at your diet now and figure out where you can make improvements. Odds are there's some pretty low hanging fruit (but not actual fruit, eat more of that) you can eliminate. I use cronometer and it's a good way to compare calories but also nutrients. I usually get the ""where do you get your protein"" or ""I'd go vegan but my iron is low"".

I never ""switched"". 4 years ago I just tried to eat more fiber. Then I was like, ""well eating this chicken, beef and eggs is counter intuitive to my goal of eating more fiber"" so they got the axe. I gave up dairy over 6-7 years ago.

I think that's why, 4 years later, I'm still eating this diet. To me it's just normal and part of who I am. It's not restrictive because it's what me and my wife do.

IBD is chronic inflammation so what you eat day to day and the symptoms you feel immediately after eating something doesn't represent a cause/trigger food.

Every study I've seen that looks at diet and IBD suggests a semi-vegetarian, vegetarian or plant based diets. Regardless of that, all studies suggest a high fiber intake is associate with reduced relapse of IBD.

If you're actively flaring then there's a risk of blockage if you suddenly increase your fiber intake, but on the whole increasing fiber will reduce inflammation. 

If you're having difficulties, start by eliminating things that cause you immediate issues. Look at a ""low fodmap"" diet that's still high in fiber, at least 35-45g/day.

and there's a lot more.

I think, after going through all of that stuff, the recommendation that needs to be made to minimize inflammation is a low-fodmap plant based diet. 

Fiber is super important in creating a good gut barrier and plant foods help that.

Lots of people will say high fiber foods will cause flares but unless there's supporting blood work I think most of that is anecdotal. I think high fiber foods in combination with a flare might bring out pain/cramps/bowel movements, but there's way too much scientific evidence to say that fiber causes flares (although during a flare they're much less tolerated).

IBD is a chronic inflammatory disease. Chronic. It means that there really isn't anything you can do that will make your IBD better tomorrow. It takes time for that inflammation to develop and time to heal it.

Track your food. I like cronometer.

Check what you're eating. You'll probably notice a lot of omega 6 fats in there and judging by your tortilla chips, turkey (i assume deli turkey?), cheese,  cream cheese,  and peanut butter that seems to be the case. If we look at the amount of fiber you're eating as well you probably only have 8-10g in there (2 per slice of bread, maybe 1-2 in the bagel). The recommendation for women is 25g/day  and men 38g/day.

But it's not just fiber, you need to look at soluble/insoluble as insoluble fiber can add bulk to your stool and can create issues rubbing on the already raw gut lining that you have because of the IBD. Generally foods that are low-fodmap are digested easier. FODMAP is a weird word, but I think a really good ""explain like I""m give"" version is the happy gut course/resources from the happy pear, done in partnership with Dr Alan Desemond (GI in Ireland) and a dietitian. https://thehappypear.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/THE-HAPPY-GUT-GUIDE.pdf

If, after the initial assessment of the storm is complete, it's decided the comfort centres should be opened, then they should be opened, but this chief's actions were completely renegade and against the advice of those tasked with making the proper decisions.

The most recent example was Dorian. It knocked out power. In september. 

EMO stresses that people should be prepared for 72 hours of emergency. Backup heat, food, etc. 

By having the assumption be that these places are open any time there's a storm it puts people at risk. EMO is telling people to stay indoors and the local fire station is telling people to come. It puts residents lives at risk as well as those trying to clean up from storms.

The worst part of this is how the fire departments are seeking compensation for opening without the municipalities approval. That's a huge issue both in terms of cost and liability. We can't have fire departments operating on their own accord. Even volunteer fire departments are under their respective municipality and while they might not agree with the councils suggestions or budget they must respect the fiscal reality we all live in

Why should my tax dollars to go open a ""emergency"" shelter that was never requested by the municipality and while EMO were telling people to stay off the roads. My tax dollars should not be spent on people that failed to have their 72 hour kits.

I haven't seen any firm reports on costs, but I saw the $1mil number being floated around. That's not pocket change, but it kind of is when you're dealing with at budget of $338 billion.

To put that into perspective, that $1 mil cost is 0.00027% of our national budget.

A lot of people are also assuming that this $1 mil is a direct handout to the royals. It's not. That money will be used to upgrade infrastructure and award security contracts, to local companies. It will be used to pay for security guards, drivers, etc....that would be local. 

Even if they bring over their complete entourage they're still spending money back into our economy that wasn't there before.

So now that $1 mil, after taxes are paid by the employees and the contractors, would look more like a $250,000 handout. 

And then we use the argument, ""how many people can that help"" with $250,000. Well let's just throw out ideas for how to use that, more CRA employees? More immigration staff? More EI staff? Well all of those offices are concentrated to specific areas so you could really make the argument that the $1 million expenditure would have a greater spin-off to the local economy if we spend it on the royals.

But do we take that $1million and distribute it back into our healthcare system? Depending on the province a doctor would make $300,000/year (that's low, but Nova Scotia and other provinces are dragging that down). So that would mean we get to employ 3 more doctors in the country. How much does that benefit the common coffers?

Again, the major flaw with that study is not controlling for subjects that are on lipid reducing medication. I don't have stats for Korea where this study was done but in the U.S, 28% of people over age 40 are on statins, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db177.htm  and that increases with age.



So the scenario is you go to the doctor and find out your cholesterol is ""220-240"", ""hey that's high, but manageable, you don't need a statin"". Then you go again and it's 280, ""hey, you need a statin"" and the total cholesterol comes back down to 230 and everyone is happy. Then you have a scenario where this person gains 10-15-20 years of life, all the time on different levels of cholesterol controlling drugs. 

Another huge flaw is looking at all-cause mortality. This study took all ages and all death scenarios. So looking at the 16 year old car accident victim and their cholesterol level really doesn't tell much about how cholesterol is related to mortality indicators indicative of issues with high cholesterol (cancer, heart disease, stroke, etc). 

To me that study is damning in a sense of the high co-morbidity rates of those with high cholesterol and CVD, stroke and cancer. It essentially means that those with higher cholesterol died more frequently of those diseases, there was no cause given to those that died but had lower cholesterol (at least not readily available)

What this study does well is comparing different sectors of the population. So because we're looking at all cause we can look at death rates of men age 50-59 compared to women 50-59. But when you lump in the entire population you can't readily make conclusions about the entire population. That's also not the intent of this study (it was to compare sub groups). So to use it as a claim to say that this study counters the established guidelines of serum cholesterol is a bit disingenuous to the study and their authors.

Consider this review, https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0685-z , where, ""The inverse association between high total cholesterol and reduced all-cause mortality in older adults is primarily due to non-cardiovascular mortality, especially among those who are not treated with cholesterol-lowering medications.""

Are you previously licenced in your country now? That will greatly effect insurance rates. If you're a new driver AND new to the country then your insurance rates might be astronomical. I suggest getting a few quotes on cars you intend to buy before pulling the trigger on any purchases. If you finance you'll be obligated to have comprehensive coverage as well, instead of the legislated liabaility-only plan. You can save a lot of money by only having liability insurance. The downside is that you'll have to pay for any damages out of pocket. That's easily mitigated by not spending above your means when you buy the car. Mine is bundled so I can't remember exactly what I pay for each vehicle or each drive. I have a 2013 Kia sportage and a 2010 hyundai accent. My wife is a new drive. Collectively we pay $209/month for insurance. Only liability on each.

You'll NEED winter tires. Don't let people tell you that you can run all seasons. Factor that in. A car with wheels that are 1"" bigger might be a difference of $20/tire which can add up.

This is a prospective cohort study. They take patient data and then compare it to their data at time of death. Of course you will have a u-shape model around the mean. That's exactly the model they were attempting to find. 

Anything over 249 showed increased morbidity rates. You literally cited an article that agrees with scientific consensus. 

Those that had cholesterol over 249mg/DL had higher comorbitity of CVD, stroke and cancer. This is a prospective cohort study. They review physicals at start of study and time of death. There is no measure of health or illness until the time of death. So having such high comorbidity of CVD/stroke/cancer in the high cholesterol group is fairly damning 

This study also didn't correct for the use of lipid lowering medication (it mentions such directly in the article) which is a huge flaw and makes their data extremely inaccurate. They found the ideal range to be between 200-249mg/do but how many of those patients were on statins 1) during their check ins and 2) at the time of their death. I'm not a medical professional but I would be willing to bet that older patients had a higher rate of lipid lowering medication which artificially skews their data to make it seem like an ideal total cholesterol level was higher than it actually should be 



This study also tells us absolutely nothing about dietary cholesterol intake and its relationship to total cholesterol, which was the point I made above. 

This isn't a huge study. It's a study of ~12,000,000 Koreans data and their deaths, 694000.

It's really not that hard to find studies that support your claim, but this isn't one. This, mostly, falls in line with most other guidelines around serum cholesterol levels.

CrohnsDisease,fdnxscb,t1_fdnrw0r,1578595016.0,"We definitely know that the dysbiosis is a cause. That's how we've lead to research in mice where we can turn on the disease by introducing these bacteria. We take a mouse with no microbiome and introduce bacteria which in turns presents UC symptoms. Likewise we can take mice with robust/healthy microbiomes and using that same method we don't get any response. 

My response made it seem definitive, which it isn't, but I'm kind of in the camp that doesn't require 100% unequivecal evidence before we can make conclusions. I mean, if we were waiting for that 100% conclusion on the causal relationship of cigarrette smoking and lung cancer then you could still argue that smoking does not cause cancer because the exact mechanisms still aren't known. 

The gut is inflammed becuase of bacteria that enter through the mucosal barrier and into our epithelial cells. The question remains, ""why is the mucosal barrier absent or degraded?"" and ""even if it is degraded, can we control it""

Genetics function insofar as that you are genetically susceptible to IBD but there MUST be an environmental trigger. That's not really up for debate anymore. There's not ""200 genes"" that can increase your risk, there are 4. NOD2 and ATG16L1 the main 2, CARD9 and CLEC7A are also included. This paper describes how each one interacts with CD and UC so I question if you even glanced over the research.

If you're interested more in FMT, check out this meta analysis https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/11/10/1180/3806618, it's not that good, since there is limited long term follow up. But FMT transplants have about the same success rate as an EEN diet. There's minimal evidence that show that the bacteria introduced in FMT's can colonize and stay there, so I wouldn't put trust in any FMT research until the methods get better."
