HumansBeingBros,feu9roe,t1_feu5hmr,1579384551.0,"It's a new-ish social media/video app similar to Vine, geared towards short clips (I think they have to be under 60 seconds).

The videos *can* be really good or entertaining (like this one), but the short-form content sometimes tends to rely on gimmicks, baiting, and low-effort attempts to keep the viewer's attention (which, in my opinion, is why almost all the clips have some kind of mainstream/catchy music playing). If you watch enough TikTok videos, you'll notice the same 10-15 songs used over and over and over, including the one in this clip.
