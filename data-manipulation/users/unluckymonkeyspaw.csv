The left is goache and pencil and done in a messier style which is the one I prefer and the right is acrylic and pencil where I was trying to imitate the more graphic style of the original sketch. I’m also thinking of just doing the series exactly like the original sketch and just using pencil and orange ink

Any advice or issues?"
