investing,ffsl1dx,t1_ffscu4d,1580184343.0,"I don't know I tend to have a knack for reading sentiment just before the bottom falls out of things. I timed 2008 by about three weeks after looking at several underlying fundamentals and thinking there were weakness and too much optimism. I dodged the BTC bubble by selling half my Azure mined Monero on Dec 4th and the rest on the 8th. Nothing crazy but it paid for taxes and a used 45k mile SUV.  
Something about what I'm seeing now feels very familiar to those other bubbles I've avoided. Also, the fundamentals just don't feel right. I moved into short term cash assets and utilities early last week and it paid off very well so far. There is just way too much going on in the US and globally for me to feel safe in general stocks without taking a very risk adverted approach. Look at the fundamentals and if you feel safe just be sure to pick stocks with a low PE and a growing trend, it's not time to gamble."

Azure is likely to be and remain their most important product and continues to gain market share. In web design share point for whatever reason continues to expand. As for gaming just because you have a Playstation doesn't mean everyone else does. The Xbox One still holds 25% market share and with both next generation consoles being AMD based APUs it really doesn't matter which you own. If you include pc gaming Microsoft is kicking everyone's ass. There are also a wide range of industries where Microsoft products hold a dominate position that you would never expect.
