Overwatch,ff3c37w,t3_er12ob,1579538217.0,"Def agree that the before is cosplay for sure. I guess my point is that the augmentation/animation, while impressive, takes away from the cosplay itself. I think it's still art, but I just have a hard time calling this final product cosplay. I think it has morphed into something else. Keep up the creative work!"
Overwatch,ff1wsra,t3_er12ob,1579487971.0,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I don't think you can really call this cosplay. It's really dope and I love it, but with all the cgi and filters and such, is it really fair to call it that? I don't say this to take anything away from any artist, I just don't know if this is really cosplay is all. Impressive work!"

TwoXChromosomes,feddaxe,t3_eoip7f,1579008285.0,"As a guy who had several very attractive teachers, these kids are just saying dumb shit to make excuses. I've never seen a woman wear something so revealing that it's distracting me from my work. If they aren't doing well in her class, it sounds like they're just looking for an excuse how it isn't their fault. Always putting the blame on someone else. I'm 28 and honestly have never had a guy friend say something like that, so I always wondered if those comments were real when I read articles about teachers making girls change their outfits because they were distracting. Now that I know that it's real, those guys need to grow the fuck up and focus on their classes. I don't know how anyone has time in a STEM class to stare at their teacher and blame them for being distracted."
