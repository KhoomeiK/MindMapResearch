For me I have a couple. 2014/15, I struggled to definitively remember who won the 2015 title, maybe because we spent so much of the second half of that season in horrible freefall and only survived relegation on the last day of the season, which distracted me. I don't remember the title run-in at all.

A bit easier to understand but 2016/17, another Chelsea win. I remember them running away with the title and Sunderland going down but that's it. I remember nothing else about that season at all. Probably because we were in the championship and I focused on that more.
