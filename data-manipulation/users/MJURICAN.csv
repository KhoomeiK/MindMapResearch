 I being a person that find it understandable that victims and sympathisers of the victims of Blairs foreign policies would celebrate his demise and take issue when people like you imply emotional reactions as such are childish. You being a person that cant even superficially engage with an opposite opinion on the matter without throwing out insults such as ""masturbatory drone with limited bandwidth"" and being a person that think victims shouldnt positively emote at their perpetrators death because ""it isnt in their interest"". 

Between these two personas, its certainly I that am the pain at the party.

Above 2 degrees change will mean that 99%+ corals reefs will die (in practice, all of it) and is an example they bring up because it show how the acidification will kill the oceans and most living matter within it. Eradicating one of the worlds most efficient carbon sinks cannot be as easily dismissed as ""we will simply fix it by taking the temperature back down."" in regards to food security as you bring up, without a functional oceanic biosystem were fucked on that front regardless.

Frankly I will just chose to rely on the IPCC directly. 

In regards to your question avout things like water level (new york being inhabitable), read their projections on water levels with a change above 2 celsius. Certainly it isnt as simple as universal level increase across the globe but even with local variance were at best looking at a newyork that would be seasonally flooded to the degree venice is, which is untenable, or worse.

Theyre presenting it very clinically but all of which I said above is in it and the result of the effects they describe is undeniably the flight of several hundred millions of people across the world and large swathes of previous urban and rural centers becoming unlivable, meaning less land for higher concetration of people. 

And I dont think anything puts it better than the fact that at an increase of 1.5 degrees the polar caps will completely melt maybe once per century, at an increase of 2 degrees it will do the same about once per decade.

MITs climate consensus is that on our current trajectory we will reach above 2 celsius increase by 2040, around 2.5 by 2050, almost 3 by 2060. An increase of 3 degrees isnt survivable for our current civilisation, 2.5 is likely to cause several regional and global world wars as nations struggle for the most basic of resources such as water, 2 degrees is the highest that the scientific community believe we maybe have a decent chance of surviving. 

If you believe whatever ""scientist"" you've listened to knows more about the subject than the whole fucking department at MIT then I'd love to see their studies. Please share with the rest of us.)



There may be a plethora of dissenting voices but the overwhelming academic and scientific consensus is clear. 

The overwhelmingly most likely scenario is that we have to keep global average warming below 1.5 celcius. If we go above that but stay below 2 celsius then its possible that the situation is managable, but on that point everyone agrees that essentially every island nation across the world will be under water, coast cities like NY will also become completely inhabitable. (which equals around a billion climate refugees that will have to flood other nations across the world if they want a chance to stay alive. Some island nations have already begun evacuating: https://qz.com/228948/an-entire-island-nation-is-preparing-to-evacuate-to-fiji-before-they-sink-into-the-pacific/)

Above 2.0 degrees celcius change there is not any signficant amount of scientist that disagrees, at that point we are fucked, not as our current lifestyles are fucked, humanity is fucked. 

According to the current trajectory of emissions, we will reach the 1.5 deadline in about 10.5 years (was 12 years when the UN report that collected all the different studies was published). 

This does not mean that in 10 years the world ends, it means that in 10 years it will have been to late to reverse the change. 

The actual high point of damage wont be seen until at the earliest 2040, but it will ramp up untill it reaches its peak. 

You talk about a ""plethora"" of scientists that are sceptical to the rampant progress of the climate crisis. But the actual stats show that most climatologists believe that we are far worse of than is currently reported, but that they are afraid to speak up exactly because people (like you, no offence) will write them off as alarmist.

Play around a bit and notice the ridiculously massive amount of things that has to be done simply to keep us under 2 degrees celcius (the deadline climatologists arent even sure is survivable). Also notice how little time we have to get it done before the limits are met. 

Climate anxiety isnt something to be avoided, its completely rational within our current parameters of change."

Its one thing reporting that sources you trust have passed something onto you. The important part is sources, plural, in journalism the golden rule is to always get atleast two sources saying the same thing before reporting on it. 

Its another thing not just to report something you've heard from one source, a source you dont have a previous relationship with, but to also pass it on as fact and without noting its from a clandestine source you dont have previous contact with. 

Some of the greatest ""scoops"" in history have come from ""sources"" informing reporters of them. The large difference between doing so irresponsibly or nor is whether you vet your sources and whether you verify with a secondary source. 

Kuessenberg have several times passed on information from singular tory sources that have after the fact been verified as complete fabrications. Like for that instance where two people accidentally walked into each other and one of them who were a tory told kuenssberg that he had been assaulted, which she reported as essential fact without a second of verification or seeking a second source. 

I cant really convey the massive importance in differentiating reporting verified information from sources and simply passing on any information that is handed to you and report it as fact. 

Its bothersome that this is the case in what is supposed to be a labourparty sub but unfortunately a lot of people, as we can see already, will be more than happy to upvote a bad faith, or at the least badly informed, comparison between reporters just so they cant bash on one of the few somewhat mainstream leftist reporters in the industry."

Thing is if a labour government would implement the kind of carbon taxation policy that essentially all economists agree on then there would be more than enough spending money to go around. The thing about it is that its unpopular and if carbon taxation is the extent of it then you risk a yellow west like uproar. If you take the proceeds and redistribute it to compensate poor and middle households then you would still have money to spend on other policies because at that point its essentially turned into a carbon fixed wealth tax.

>The media is mainstream and conservative and holds mainstream conservative views systematically... So what?

Well first off I wouldnt call it conservative necessarily. Its moneyed, which can take form of conservatism sure but also liberalism. 

And one nuanced perspective is that with that conclusion in mind it is a fair argument to present that one will never succeed by ""playing the media game"" while presenting a leftist platform. ""Pressability"" is fairly irrelevant in a leadership candidate. 

The alternative approach is to refuse to play the rules of the media and instead disseminate your politics to the populace in such a way that either the media reporting becomes irrelevant or the media realise they are losing popular capital and start accurately reporting your arguments to catch up. 

New labour succesfully managed this by essentially wrangling reporters and media outlets, aswell as some underhanded agreements with certain publications. And it certainly didnt hurt that New labour from the outset made it quite clear that it wouldnt disturb the thatcherite neoliberal consensus (This is not an attack, its something Blair has quite openly stated himself). 

So that worked but, as we then found out with brown, playing a game of optics is largely futile nowadays because the media operandi has largely caught up and completely assimilated the new labour media managment, and what we now have instead is a media that completely refuse labour and the libdems to pull the tricks that New Labour pulled while looking the other way when the tories does it again and again (which we've seen quite a lot with Boris, in contrast to May).

So a new path has to be forged. 

I would argue this is what the Corbyn leadership attempted and largely succeeded with in 2017. Instead of going through the media like Blair they chose to completely circumvent them and go pure grassroot, which caused a massive upset in the end albeit not enough of one. 

Then last year Corbyn failed entirely. Now whether that is due to the 2017 dissemination strategy already being defunct or the leadership ultimately being incompetent and overestimating their silent support (I tend to assume the latter) is difficult to tell but it what is clear is that they failed. Of course other, often invisible, factors have to be considered aswell. 

Its even arguable that post cambride analytica there isnt a dependable approach to grassroot outreach anymore because its so easily propagandised. 

Now going forward we have to once again settle on an ""alternative"" media approach and I'm frankly afraid that a lot of key people, or even laymen like in here, are too stuck in the optics mindset and judge more how certain personal characteristics will play in the papers rather than how said candidate themselves will attempt to play the papers. You can see it already with Phillips and RLB playing up the fact that they're women and northern, Starmer supporters play up his ""he **looks** like a leader""  (latent misogyny aside) etc, rather than questioning more precisely how the candidates plan to handle the media and information dissemination as a whole. 

If we look at the candidates my fear is that Starmer is too middle road. Not dismissing the possibility that he has some novel approach to the issue ofcourse. I make the assumption from his earlier media presentation that he will neither go full on aggresive like Blair (which I dont think works anymore but I'm willing to be disproven) nor completely grassroot like Corbyn, but instead will simply try to middle it between and largely will get stuck attempting to chasing the media and play their game rather than the opposite. 

Here is where Chomskys conclusion become really important because as he shows a labour leader simply cannot succeed by playing the medias game per their rules. So the fear here is that people will elect Starmer because they think he fits the medias mold of a PM, only to find that the media doesnt care what fits their mold because it will never be considered in fair light regardless. 

On to RLB. My assumption is that she will attempt to replicate the ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" approach. Which is certainly possible but unlike Corbyn she doesnt have a history of involving herself in grassroots movements and stirring enthusiasm as he has so its not possible to gauge her potential in this regard. Not really much more to say here. 

Nandy I have no idea what she'll do. She has a history of looking and working outside the box so if anyone of them are likely to attempt something new it would be her. And I'd say she is about equally likely to attempt a grassroot or aggresive media strategy otherwise. Unlike RLB I more confident in Nandys ability to foster a grassroot outreach but its still to unpredictable to fairly judge. 

Phillips will likely play the same media game she always has and assume she'll continue as the media darling that she has become by joining in their attacks on Corbyns labour. She will be in for a rude awakening if she thinks she'll be gifted as warm consideration in the media as the party leader as she was as a loud and aggressive backbencher. 

So in short I guess what manufacturing consent show us is that its virtually impossible for, say, Starmer, to both campaign on the next election with a manifesto as radical as the 2017 one (which he has stated he will largely retain) while also refusing to challenge the medias role in society at its core. A politician can either play the ""easy"" optics and current media rules dissemination game, or one can present fairly radical left wing policies. One can not do both.

One can join the legal team of an institution with the ambition to defend it (as in, making a politically active decision) only to find that the issues are too entrenched to fix from an internal position, leading to one realising the issue must be taken one step above (to ""proper"" politics) so therefore one joins the public political scene quite abruptly.

America eradicated the only two other viable political faction in afghanistan when they blindly funded the mujahedin, first they politicided anyone with even vaguely leftist ideas (which is why america supported them) and then the radical faction murdered the moderate faction of the mujahedin.

I'm sorry but I've got to stop you there. 

No. That was not ""typical"" of other social democratic parties around the world. 

Even today that would be considered a very very ""light"" social democratic policy around the parties around europe, its the kind of policies you enact as a last effort when you've lost enough political capital that you cant enact a more radical policy. 

Take minimum wage for instance. That would be considered the bare minimum among all social democratic parties abroad and all of them would consider it an abject failure because the neccesity of a barebones minimum wage mean that the labour movement as a whole, as in the negotiating power of the unions, have been so completely broken that something so basic as decent compensation have to be forced upon companies top down rather than reached through strong unions putting the pinch on them. 

Minimum wage is a fundamentally socially liberal policy, not a socdem policy and definitely not a policy of a party that call themselves the political arm of the labour movement. 

Except for paternity/maternity rights all the examples you bring up are socially liberal policies that some socdem parties have adopted while in power in negotiation with right leaning parties, its not something said parties consider ""good"" or even close to what they actually want to implement. 

Fact is that before Blair took power these forms of policies wouldnt even have begun to be considered a potential social democratic policy even after having been watered down in parliamentary negotiation. 

Blair is the primary reason why these form of policies are **now** considered social democratic by some, because he succeeded electorally and without needing to do so egregiously watered down the economically left policies that the party could have enacted with the immense power it had achieved. And as a result social democratic parties in other nations attempted to mimic his success. 

Just as an example the moderate party in sweden (a right wing conservative party) began calling itself the ""new moderate"" party(aping ""new labour"") and the soc dem party debated internally to do the same. 

Blair literally was a pioneer within europe that showed that third way politics were a potential path to electoral success. He (and new labour) is one of the primary reason why the overtone window shifted so rightwards in the whole of europe, whereas the third way political success with Reagan, Bush and Clinton had before only been considered a uniquely phenomenon, but Blair showed it could be done in europe. 

I know it may sound weird but genuinely, take a look at the party programmes of socdem parties around the continent before Blair was elected and then look at their programmes two elections in. They will all have massively shifted. 

Blair didnt take middle of the road socdem policies from the contintent and apply them in britain, he took middle of the road policies form socially liberal parties across the continent, slapped a red sticker on them and applied them, all while dismissing all calls to go further because all these policies didnt fundamentally affect anything substanitally and they wouldnt survive past even one tory government. 

The reason why you think of these policies as standard socdem policies is because Blair took over a formerly labour-movement/socdem/socialist party, and then after he gained power only implemented liberal policies. New labour made it so that liberal policies are now considered socialdemocratic. 

Its completely ahistorical to call his policies typically social democratic since 20 years ago these wouldnt even have been floated in a party meeting anywhere on the continent."
