canada,ffi3k15,t1_ffi0hwa,1579964060.0,"I find there's always a disturbing amount of hyperbole when it comes to assuming the other sides identity, especially with gun issues. Unfortunately this just pushes us further to the side we were already on, and causes us to ignore facts on the opposite side.

Most gun owners are every day people. They're not rednecks and they're not looking to shoot anyone.

Most people on the other side aren't out to take away people's rights. They're not party poopers and they don't all vote liberal.

There's only two issues here. 1) Is gun control even effective? 2) Does someone else's hobby supercede others rights to not want any guns around?

Both are difficult questions to answer, honestly."
