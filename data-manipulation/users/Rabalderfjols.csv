tinnitus,ffhq23u,t3_etong1,1579947833.0,"You don't need professionals to rinse your ears. Pour some cooking oil (this is just as good as any earwax removal stuff in the drug store) and lie your side for a while so it gets a chance to soak in. Then wait for a few hours or longer. Nurses will tell you to do this a day before rinsing, but in my experience it's not strictly necessary, though it softens the wax and makes it easier. Go to your shower, remove the shower head and bring the water up to body temperature (or else you will get dizzy as hell). Direct the stream towards the earhole and experiment with pressure and direction. This should take care of it.

I did this in desperation (without the oil) on a holiday, after having an ear clogged by wax after a flight. It worked like a charm, but I wondered if it could be dangerous. Told my ENT, he said it was fine. After all, nurses use quite a bit of force when they rinse with a syringe - the ear drum isn't that fragile (unless perhaps if you have an infection). From then on, I've always rinsed my own ears in the shower. No more waiting for assholes telling me ""it's not an emergency""."

One of the great things about video games as a cultural phenomenon is that it's so egalitarian and democratic - everyone who buys the game has access to the same experience (yes, some people have better PCs than others). Microtransactions and launch day DLC are on a steady course towards making that a thing of the past. It's also a fundamentally dishonest business model. They sell small nothings to vulnerable people. One of the problems with video games is the addiction aspect - but the pay-once-model somewhat mitigates this. The art form deteriorates because games are designed to annoy and addict players into paying, instead of providing a fun, wholesome experience for all customers. I could go on.

To elaborate a bit: I think it's normal even for good people to have a bit of toxic isms in them, and the best we can do is acknowledge them through introspection and work to do better next time. Being a racist doesn't necessarily mean you think it's OK to be, or that you're not open to improvement. I, for one, sometimes catch myself thinking sexist thoughts, but stop before acting them out. Nothing serious, but occasionally I'm in a discussion with a woman and realize I'm about to mansplain something to her. Deep down I guess you could say I'm kind of sexist, but I strive to not let it show.

philosophy,fddzlot,t3_ekvqzq,1578327799.0,"""Positive thinking"" strikes me as one of those terms that don't really mean what many people think they mean. Positive thinking doesn't necessarily mean ""think about the ""*good*"" things in life"" (whatever the hell that is), but about the things that actually *are*, things that you can relate to in a meaningful manner and do something about. ""Think positive"" doesn't mean ""don't worry"", it means ""worry about the right things""."

theouterworlds,fcuajq9,t1_fcu8ylr,1577976468.0,"I've tried it all, game mode and all the fancy settings. The thing is, what I get out of the Xbone is crap, and the OLED, being such a high fidelity display, turns out crap. But I've been looking at youtube vids today, and finally found one where I could see the game in motion instead of the useless ones that mostly compare how different hardware performs when you stand still. And it does appear - on youtube - that the game is much less blurry on Pro.

Kinda sucks though. When these deluxe consoles arrived, there was a more or less explicit promise from the industry that games should look and play ok on lesser HW as well,and everything above would be mere eye candy. This is obviously not the case with Outer Worlds and a few other games on Xbone."

That doesn't sound like much until you remember that db is a logarithmic scale. 12 db reduction is your T reduced by half and then by half again. The louder the starting point, the greater the reduction. I'm not sure I'll need more cure than that, especially since pills probably will have side effects."

Start out with a little and increase until it works. If you've ever had your ears cleaned by a nurse, they're not holding back. It's not like they're afraid to rupture your eardrum or anything, they're blasting that syringe. Oh, and don't *cover* your ear hole with the hose, hold it at a small distance so the water can find its way back out and you can direct the flow around to get the right angle."

tinnitus,fc8v8bp,t3_egqncb,1577542552.0,"Those drug store earwax removal oils isn't better than cooking oil, and the supplied balloon doesn't, in my experience, provide enough pressure and water to get a proper rinse. You might as well drip some sunflower oil into your ears. If you have too much earwax, the oil might get trapped in there, exacerbating your tinnitus (temporarily). 

I've used the shower to clean my ears a few times - just remove the head, set the temperature to body level and experiment with angles and pressure until stuff comes out. I first did this in desperation on a vacation, after realizing my earplugs had jammed some wax into place. Didn't really think it was safe, but when I told my ENT about it later, he said no problem. The last time I did it I flushed out a plug so big I kinda regret sending it down the drain. But do use some oil a day or two in advance, that makes it much easier."
bartenders,fc8edyz,t3_ego5n1,1577533038.0,"Denying people service is never fun, but it comes with the job. Some people have hygiene issues. Often you don't notice right away, so they get to buy a beer and sit down, and it gets harder to throw them out. Seasoned stinkers know this and try to order right away.  

A colleague of mine was working. In walks a guy, more or less normal looking. But when he steps up to order, my coworker can tell right away he reeks. Tells him ""sorry, but I cant serve you today. You simply smell too bad."" ""Oh yeah, what do I smell like?"" ""You smell like urine. Piss."" ""Oh, I know *that*"" as if this somehow should turn things around. A few moments of awkward silence ensues, during which the guest grabs a barstool and sits down. My colleague realizes the guy isn't planning to leave - he's not hostile, he just doesn't get it. ""I'm sorry, but you can't stay. You'll have to leave."" Guy sort of wiggles around for a few seconds, then gets up and walks out, slowly and awkwardly. Relieved, my colleague walks around the bar to put the barstool back into place, when he notices it's wet. Upon further inspection, the moisture turns out to be not piss, but shit. Diarrhea. That barstool now has the permanent ritual status of ""unclean"" and rests in the junk pile in the backyard. No amount of detergent can save it."
