He then expected a game of chase/play-fight. If you peeked out of your hiding spot to check his progress while he was stalking you and he caught you looking, he'd sit down where ever he was and very pointedly ignore you and act annoyed if you tried to play with him in any way. So sometimes you'd be calling and calling and he'd just never come and other times he'd be just about to pounce on you.

You are also assuming that *everyone* in the alliance is working selflessly, which is counter to human nature. I can think of no large group of political allies that has ever done so.

He's tried hard over the years but I'll always be the one cutting in and he'll use the roller. And I'll be the one picking out the paint, getting the supplies, and cleaning up after. He'll move the furniture back in and I'll put everything in, on and around the furniture/walls. He *will* buy and hang curtains on his own initiative. And anything tech/electricity related he's all over. Sometimes I wish I got to do the demo instead of the cleanup, but at least the job gets done in the end.  
Despite all this, all the males in my family complement him on all his hard work on various projects that I did completely by myself (hubby will quickly and proudly correct this misconception but it never seems to stick).  This is hilarious because my dad is so very NOT handy and my mom does most of the simple diy that they don't contract out. He doesn't think women can't do anything men do, it just genuinely does not occur to him that's an option until it's presented to him. And my grandma was a very independent woman so I'm not sure where that mindset came from. 

I would have loved to do the trades but that was NOT an option I was allowed to explore educationally, but my parents are now much more open to that idea. Too bad I'm too old and my body is too much of a mess to do it as anything but a hobby. C'est la vie."

A few questions since you seen up for them! do you keep your water tank indoors?

I have a part of my house built like that (converted deck) and we just close it off for the winter since the lack of insulation would just make it too expensive. How do you manage in your part of the world?

Has your community had problems with melting permafrost (climate change)? How has it effected the average person? Canada has been having harder times keeping roads in service, pavement or ice roads, due to climate change and it's really effecting smaller communities. Curious to hear your story.

askTO,fdvfyfc,t1_fds3yz8,1578747055.0,"Yes, for sure. It gives you temporary resistance to certain strains of the flu. They try to predict what types of flu will be going around and that's what the flu shot covers. If that guess is wrong or it mutates, the flu shot won't help. It's also not an immediately resistance, it takes a couple weeks for you to create enough antibodies to fight off the covered strains, and the immunity only lasts for a few months (your body will eventually stop replicating the antibodies). 
BUT it's better odds than playing the lottery that it will help keep you heathy, it's free and available at pharmacies, drs offices, public health clinics and many employers offer free clinics for the shots too. It's not just for you either, it's for everyone around you- your immunity means you're not carrying it to other people (like children, the elderly or those with compromised immune systems). And given the misery that the flu causes, taking 15 minutes to get a shot and prevent all that suffering is a no brainer.    
Lots of people complain that the flu shot does not work or that it made them sick- likely you already were infected, since it can take a few weeks to show symptoms, or you got infected before you had enough antibodies to fight it off. Or you got a different strain of flu than was covered by the shots. Or you got a bacterial infection and mislabeled it the flu (the flu is a virus, not a bacteria, so the flu shot does not help fight bacterial infections).

But doing it 100% that was was rather strongly frowned on. It was cool when you did something else completely for the reception, though if you spent $$$$ people thought you were crazy too, since there was no reason to. But that's probably because most people have non Mormon family and friends that help tip the crazy scales closer to normal in most things. Sitting your work friends on metal folding chairs for a pot luck dinner under the basketball nets... Not a good look. And wedding presents are also on the cheaper side and you don't tend to get lots of $$ from Mormons as presents either. On the other hand, there's still a lot of community support. They like to all the congregations women attend a shower because they're so genuinely happy for you to hit that life event.

weddingshaming,fcitm5w,t1_fciqgh0,1577669513.0,"There are multiple showers usually, one for each future spouse's families unless they all live in the same town. Then there's often a social circle shower, like friends, religious groups, social groups, etc. Each spouse will usually have a small work shower as well. This applies to both weddings and babies.

A shower is generally a large gathering with people of all ages, with less familiar people and those that may not be attending the wedding (if a bridal shower) invited as well. Food, usually games (usually very stupid, I don't like games), and present opening being the key activities. They may or may not be a surprise to the guest of honor. They tend to be daytime activities, so only light refreshments, very little to no alcohol (not hard and fast rules). It's considered somewhat rude to drink at a baby shower since the guest of honor can't.

A bachelorette party will be the wedding party/attendants and perhaps a few close friends and family members as well. There's usually at least a meal and an activity. They can be just an afternoon/evening thing, or can be a get away weekend. If it's only adult women attending without older family members there usually is an evening of heavy drinking involved. Activities are often a spa trip, a shopping or other stereotypical ""female"" activity to encourage bonding and stress reduction for the bride. Because of all this it's usually held about a month before the wedding, especially if there is a lot of alcohol involved. 

Attendees don't bring gifts to the bachelorette party but they are usually expected to pay their own way and the bridal party also pays for the bride's expenses.

People can and do put their own spin on these activities, adding or dropping or adapting them as suits them. For example baby showers used to be a female only thing, but dad showers and co ed showers are becoming more common. Old rules used to be that you and your family never hosted showers, if no one else offered to host one you didn't get one. But now people tend to host their own or immediate family members do it. 

Which strikes me as grabby. But when I refused to open a registry for my wedding, saying it was too grabby, I got told off by so many people who insisted I get one, that eventually I gave in. I registered at a very inexpensive store, not the usual high end department store, which annoyed a lot of people too. I was trying to save people money and didn't want to dictate what people were to get me and just wanted to celebrate my wedding with everyone- but apparently that was rude too?! You really really can't please everyone."

weddingshaming,fch42or,t1_fcfe6gl,1577647088.0,"Yep, weddings in rural families may include an engagement party, but for sure have a Jack and Jill ($, raffle donations), separate bachelor/ette parties (pay you're own way), at least one shower, usually two (separate presents for each you attend) plus the wedding itself (all attendees expected to give gifts including wedding party). But it's sort of a circular thing, since everyone does them, you get ""paid back"" at yours. Jack and Jill's have a ticket fee, cash bar for alcohol (non alcohol is usually free), at least a dozen raffles, and lots of games, all for a fee, plus a 50/50 raffle. Toonie toss is a favorite and big money maker- you slide a $2 coin across the floor to see who can get closest to the prize, usually a bottle of alcohol. Everyone takes turns shooting and it can get rather ""heated."" I think my sister made at least 3 hundred dollars alone at that game alone, likely even more.  There's also usually a few door prizes for people who show up. The wedding party fronts the money for the alcohol for the cash bar, Hall rental, lottery and liquor licence, snacks and decoration, but generally are paid back for the liquor. The raffle items, game prizes, door prizes are donated by family and friends. Wedding party members are expected to sell tickets, and will peddle them to friends and family and coworkers that don't even know the engaged couple.

I didn't do all this, for the record! I did have friends throw me a shower that i didn't know about in advance, but that was it! 

Best part of all this is that in a user or two they have a kid, and then that round of parties starts. At least two showers, a joint shower for men and women, a gender reveal party, and you're expected to bring a gift the first time you visit the new baby. Cash based games and presents expected at every party you attend! Gah."

Frugal,fc4f37g,t1_fc321mu,1577414819.0,"I'm old, so pre digital era photo books were all printed photos. I got the tip from my Mom to buy postcards of the places I've travelled to since there's zero way to get photos without crowds in them or from a good angle while the postcards are tourist free and well composed. I got teased that all my photos had me in them after one trip- but snaps of the general views were redundant to the post cards so....

 In the digital era it's easy to snag a picture online or take a bunch and edit them or just take enough to statistically get one that's 'good'. And photo books can be just straight up digital or professionally offset printed and bound for not all that much more than developing a vacations worth of film would be.

JUSTNOMIL,fc2tbyo,t3_efq5dw,1577373448.0,"I'm the family jewellery hoarder, since I'm sentimental, and the oldest. I also seem to be doing the same thing for the in laws. I was given my late GMIL's engagement ring, which I took only after making it abundantly clear that I would not wear it as an engagement ring. Everyone is OK with this, so it sits in my jewellery box making the very occasional appearance on my right hand (wedding band is on the left) mostly for the sweet aunt who passed it to me, who has no problem with my plans for it. The crap marriage the ring came from is something I want nothing to do with. 

Jokes on all them, I'm not having kids so the in laws will have to deal with it all again when I die.

Just add it to your jewellery box and wear it on your non ring hand on occasion to remind them you're not wearing it as an engagement ring, poke poke poke, lol. Two can play the pettyness game! Once a gift is given FMIL has no say in what happens to it, even if the gift had ""conditions"" she can't enforce them. Have it remade into something else just to poke a little harder! It's yours now!"
