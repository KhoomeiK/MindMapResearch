Justrolledintotheshop,ffexbll,t1_ffev9ak,1579869266.0,I work in IT and get a new phone every 2 years because I can afford it and I want a new phone.
Justrolledintotheshop,ffex94a,t1_ffe6kl7,1579869195.0,"I mean if it works, it works. Am I supposed to buy a 200$ phone charger for no other reason aside from the fact that I can afford it? I don't even know where to get a phone charger that costs more than 15-20$."
AskMen,ffd0swi,t1_ffcjp6m,1579811174.0,Huh? You're not forced to go into debt with a credit card. Pay the balance off every month.
television,fey5arw,t1_fewrnbf,1579440993.0,Especially since you can see it's written on both sides of the building when Walt walks up to the van. OP seems to imply it was shot in some weird way to symbolize a change in Walt when in reality it's just two different angles of the building.
politics,fek05ag,t3_epkzlg,1579189763.0,"Now we've reached the stage where Republicans admit the law was broken but ""who cares""."
Impeach_Trump,feiu403,t1_feitj05,1579147257.0,Because each pen was used at an historical moment in American history. Many people will get to keep one as a symbol to this day. Same reason the president signs a bill into law using several pens.
selfhosted,feiiqc3,t1_fehnsq9,1579139461.0,Thanks for this. I've been using dokuwiki for quite some time but this looks much more suited to my use case.
Ring,fegdb8h,t1_fefy20z,1579088604.0,And your face since Amazon is doing facial recognition now.
Ring,fefff1o,t1_feet7c7,1579055181.0,"If you're that paranoid, you shouldn't have bought an Amazon product and placed it in your house."
pcgaming,fef8d8w,t1_feehgbj,1579050597.0,This is supposed to happen. There's nothing wrong with playing on a lower difficulty if you're finding it too challenging.
EmulationOnAndroid,fedadq9,t1_fdptozo,1579005583.0,It needs to be a bluetooth xbox one controller.
cableporn,fe5i27o,t1_fe4eqvi,1578869717.0,From a switch to pass the cables to the back of the rack to reach the back of equipment in the rack.
facepalm,fdnquy4,t1_fdnqrdu,1578591081.0,You're welcome!
facepalm,fdnqom9,t1_fdnqad5,1578590992.0,"Lol literally everyone is telling you you're wrong. You're either lying or an idiot. I don't care either way, just pointing out the errors in what you said."
facepalm,fdnq5pa,t1_fdnpw7r,1578590744.0,He would have gotten more but doesn't realize the 4500 was minus deductible.
facepalm,fdnpuqt,t1_fdnnll0,1578590603.0,You're welcome. Glad to help out.
facepalm,fdnm675,t1_fdngunv,1578588691.0,"I mean unless you somehow know who keyed your car and somehow get them to give you their insurance information, you're still paying your deductible and your rates are still going up. That's just how insurance works. You'd also need evidence to prove the person driving the car next to you keyed your car too."
cats,fdgz5ez,t1_fdghses,1578411844.0,Both my cats hide one paw and keep another paw fully extended when loafing.
RimWorld,fdfeckn,t1_fdf9tgb,1578359707.0,Yes I know...
RimWorld,fdetb9x,t1_fdesyln,1578346163.0,"Thanks, I need to go find that now."
specializedtools,fdestbd,t1_fden9lz,1578345870.0,How would I go about finding out where mine is? I've never heard of anything like that before.
RimWorld,fdespuf,t1_fdepnpx,1578345812.0,I probably turned it off ages ago and forgot.
RimWorld,fdens7v,t1_fde2zje,1578342905.0,I didn't even know there was fog in this game. I also don't remember checking that option before so I wonder if it was defaulted on a long time ago.
RimWorld,fdenl1g,t1_fde5a0s,1578342790.0,Cook doesn't need to be busy all day with the feed the colonists mod I think it's called. Lets you cook 4 meals at a time. Still takes the same amount of time and resources as it would to do 1 meal 4 times but it's much more efficient and doesn't tie up an entire colonist to cooking. Coupled with storing raw materials and cooked food very close to the kitchen you should only need a part time cook.
specializedtools,fdeg66a,t1_fdeaqx1,1578338314.0,Your community has a scale open for public use?
AbandonedPorn,fd5fkfb,t1_fd5bxm2,1578177147.0,Yes it was negative when they first saw it and now it's been upvoted back into the positive. Negatively voted posts don't really mean much except that they are sorted lower than higher upvoted posts.
AbandonedPorn,fd58dwu,t1_fd4yzgr,1578175157.0,The post was downvoted when the comment was made. Since then more reasonable people came along and upvoted it.
DivinityOriginalSin,fcz5v0a,t3_cx0mc4,1578094284.0,Is it possible to make a bad character and end up getting screwed later by bad choices? I don't like to minmax and don't want to rely too heavily on following some build guide. I like to just pick skills that seem interesting and fun but don't wanna get stuck later with a bad character. I've played other rpgs before but this is my first turn based rpg in a long time.
hoi4,fcyn1oi,t1_fcxwyxs,1578083098.0,"People don't need a reason to hate Trump, he gives us dozens of them a week. Not sure why you put Russian Hacking in quotes. That actually happened and has been confirmed by every major US intelligence agency. You need to start accepting this."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,fcxr11a,t1_fcxj7vh,1578069309.0,Right but you asked about cost. Dozens of  bulbs are much more expensive than a few switches.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,fcxqtsi,t1_fcxkjhf,1578069241.0,You can do that with switches too.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,fcxfta7,t1_fcwkr2k,1578061813.0,I wouldn't replace all bulbs with smart bulbs. I'd replace the switch itself with a smart switch. That way you can control all the bulbs on that switch smartly. One switch would be much cheaper and more easily controlled than dozens of bulbs. Depends on your situation though.
videos,fcx7hzs,t3_ej9ax7,1578054356.0,Lol should've just refused the delivery.
tifu,fcvn6w6,t1_fcv9dl1,1578005717.0,Most states in the US are at will employment.
WeWantPlates,fclih4c,t3_ehpoqr,1577748560.0,I've seen many good posts on here but this one takes the cake.
homedefense,fclfosz,t3_ehg79b,1577746712.0,"> ... and I'm frankly staggered by the cost on some of these


>  Total cost, just under a grand for."
homedefense,fc9e7o7,t1_fc97vs5,1577551320.0,I second this. I use 3 different Reolink cameras in my setup with Blue Iris and have had no issues so far.
pcgaming,fc8x4te,t1_fc7lzji,1577543494.0,"Nah, people parts. Because that makes sense in this thread."
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fc0st5p,t1_fc09uip,1577298850.0,Nah they know the difference. My cats are much softer with my hands than they are with a toy.
