todayilearned,fczqs9o,t1_fczor5d,1578107004.0,">The second perspective is the cultural perspective ... that is, deafness is just a different way of being.

So that perspective is wrong. Deafness is absolutely a flaw, the inability to use a very basic sense that virtually everyone has, that we evolved to have, is a flaw. I get why people try to act like it's a positive, or nothing negative, I was taught that my ADHD/autism is just a different way of thinking, but it's a disability. For a grown adult to go deaf and to refuse treatment to correct their hearing it's one thing. For someone to argue against improving a child's disability is wrong in my opinion."

We need sanitation, or we're going to eventually have legal trouble if we're just dumping our human waste somewhere. So his point of being able to live off of $400 a month isn't really accurate, we're just not allowed to set up camp out in the wilderness, so even if you're fine with the quality of life of a hunter-gatherer, you're not allowed to live like that."

science,fcwaiuv,t1_fcw1v88,1578020921.0,"The dude is 350lbs at 5'7. He said he has been fat since highschool, and his only ""but"" in regard to sitting all day is riding a bike 15-20 minutes to work. He's obese. I've been an athlete my whole life, I lift weights every day, train submission grappling most days, and have done steroids in the past and am about 220lbs at 6'. I'd be obese if I put on another 130lbs.


We know this guy's lifestyle because he literally said it. He sits around all day other than biking to work, and his first day of going for a jog. He's not talking about training for his upcoming strongman or bodybuilding competition, he's talking about seeing if his pants get looser after a month. Anyone who isn't delusional would be able to figure out that there's a 100% change of someone in his situation being obese. It has nothing to do with trying to make him feel bad, he recognized the need to change, and is at least at the beginning stage of making a change. That's awesome. But people like you don't need to poke in with comments like "" well ackchyalllllyyyy, we don't know if he's obese."""

I've seen so many coworkers over the years who've done stupid juicing diets to lose weight, juicing up tons of fruits with maybe some vegetables, and occasionally a little protein powder, and drinking a couple of them each day, but still eating their regular food, and somehow don't understand why drinking hundreds of extra calories doesn't cause them to drop fat."

She is wrong actually. I'm not saying it's necessarily healthier, but it's not unhealthy either. The human body isn't usually that shitty. Also, that's basically a normal practice for many people who do intermittent fasting, and there is evidence that intermittent fasting has some positive effects like improved insulin sensitivity and maybe possibly even some life extension benefits. In addition to that, there is some evidence through at least bodybuilders who've been eating 6+ small meals per day for decades that it may cause insulin insensitivity and eating many small meals per day might not be optimal.


Sorry, basically just a long winded way of saying not to let the idea of it being unhealthy influence you into changing it if you're happy with it and it works for you."
PublicFreakout,fcvi888,t1_fcu9vn1,1578002635.0,">The guy shooshing her is a downright sexist act. I don’t think he’s conscious of it, I’m sure he’s simply trying to keep the peace, but he wouldn’t have done that if it was a man. Case in point - the man screaming moments later with a LOT more anger and confrontation.


Maybe I'm missing something, but why do you assume it's because of her gender, rather than her size and non-aggression? If she were 6"" taller, had 40lbs more muscle, and was aggressively hostile do you think he would have acted in the same manner?


I ask this because I work in a career where I routinely deal with violent and aggressive men. I'm a big guy, around 220lbs, routinely lift weights, and have been involved in martial arts my entire life, and I handle people differently depending my my perceived threat. If a man who is 150lbs is non-compliant, I'm not very worried about gently but firmly trying to redirect them even if I don't have solid control of them, especially if they aren't being excessively aggressive towards me. If a man who is equal in size or bigger than me is acting aggressive towards me, yelling and cussing at me, clenching his fists or tensing his body up, I'm not going to deal with him in the same manner."
