cats,ffw0bxr,t1_fdapdvq,1580279140.0,"I wonder if he might (and his humans too) be ready for a new addition? I usually recommend trying to adopt kitties that most need a home, but he looks like such a sweetheart that I imagine him as being a wonderful father to a youngster that needs lessons on becoming a true cat. Just a thought. I'm sure you will find that time when you are ready for another purrball."
TwoXChromosomes,ffvzxyf,t1_fdbabx7,1580278740.0,Thank you! I'm sorry. I'm ultra new to Reddit and didn't check on the app or know about any replies. I am so sorry!  I'm here. I'm just terrible about keeping up with things. I hope you are doing well?
cats,ffvzn3x,t1_fdbk0x9,1580278429.0,"I've had her for six years now, so I can't remember exactly, but she surprises me constantly. She was wanting to gnaw on my hand the other day, something she's never done. I'm so glad I saw her at the pet store. Poor dear was in a room away from most everything. She was being sponsored by the pet store for the humane society and looked under a year as she was small but they said she was a year old. So quiet, and shy. She was my first ""impulse"" buy. I was not actively looking for another pet as I was in an apartment, but she was meant to be with us. She still looked like she was nursing, so I'm thinking that it was a depressing loss to one day be a mama kitty, then in a cage with no companionship or any animals around. She's loved very much and is my snuggly partner!"
