videos,ffjpgz5,t1_ffj196c,1580003675.0,I think it's a testament to the writers of both Roseanne and the Connors that the main character can be written out and there's no decline in quality. They don't miss a beat.
AskReddit,ffh7sut,t1_ffe3xo7,1579925548.0,"Dude, I asked because I didn't want to watch the video and find out. Horrific mutilation isn't my bag."
AmItheAsshole,ffh7fh3,t1_ffgw965,1579925234.0,"Oh the bright side, maybe OP will pick an easier color to wear."
PublicFreakout,ffh79pa,t1_ffcwn9b,1579925098.0,Rats are legitimately incredibly smart and they're capable of empathy. You can also tell that these are domesticated rats and that he's been taking very good care of them. This is just a guy who loves his pets and some pets that really trust him.
AmItheAsshole,ffgnk21,t1_ffftnwh,1579910400.0,"I don't know why OP didn't pick brown. It's a neutral, so it would work for everyone and still fits with the fall theme."
AmItheAsshole,ffgngoi,t1_ffg2gzr,1579910335.0,Maybe the MOH wanted OP to know that the bridesmaids weren't enthused about the color but were too polite to say so.
AskReddit,ffe0cvm,t1_ffd9f50,1579833432.0,How did he react?
PublicFreakout,ffdvwft,t1_ff6ifl1,1579830235.0,I read about a fat guy who was saved from having his throat cut by a robber by squishing his head down so his double chin was in the way.
PublicFreakout,ffdsdv8,t1_ffbbusu,1579827735.0,They also have parents.
PublicFreakout,ffds8d0,t1_ffceqtt,1579827631.0,"The key word is when. If nobody is hiring, it doesn't matter what your qualifications are. If you're in a small town, jobs can be hard to come by because there's just not that many businesses."
AmItheAsshole,ffdope5,t1_ffdgumv,1579825375.0,So you can't read is what you're saying?
AmItheAsshole,ffdgpux,t1_ffcjue4,1579820503.0,Irritability is probably also common two days after you've been gutted like a trout.
AmItheAsshole,ffdfdeb,t1_ffcskz3,1579819713.0,"So think of it this way, one partner sprained their ankle. It hurts a lot and they can't walk well. Meanwhile the other partner simultaneously shattered their leg and needed major surgery to put their bones back together and is wheelchair bound. Yeah, both their legs hurt and they're both having trouble getting around, but do you think the one with the shattered leg has the kind of patience to hear complaints about a sprain? Cause I really don't think so."
AmItheAsshole,ffch7nx,t1_ffbd7ha,1579799396.0,"The doubling down is the exact reason the authorities should be notified. Her unwillingness to take personal responsibility for her obvious mistakes means she is not fit to work as a stylist. Mistakes happen, but a professional does everything they can to correct them and learns from the experience."
AmItheAsshole,ffc4p8a,t1_ffbxc55,1579791460.0,"Of course, one would think being adopted at all would be better than not being adopted regardless of race. I can't really get behind anything that would lead to less adoptions happening."
AmItheAsshole,ffc490u,t1_ffb4him,1579791153.0,"I crochet, so not the same as quilting, but I understand the work that goes into something like that. Even if it's the ugliest quilt in the world, it is a piece of art that someone put a ton of time and effort into. Seriously, quilting is an especially difficult and time consuming skill, that's why few people know how. People who insult handmade crafts like that really grind my gears."
crochet,ff7ykyd,t3_erxhiv,1579661445.0,"Thanks, I hate it.

But really, super impressive."
thesims,feyatbd,t1_fex01d3,1579443120.0,I really enjoy making tv characters but I never play them. I like the challenge of making them just right.
AskReddit,fepclwx,t1_feoszpp,1579317224.0,Because I totally wouldn't feel ancient seeing guys I crushed super hard on in high school looking old and fat. I want to remember them and myself as we were.
AmItheButtface,fep0ltm,t1_feox0i5,1579309472.0,"Looked at their profile and they're a troll. 3 posts, all removed for being offensive."
AmItheButtface,fep06bz,t1_feo5w3r,1579309198.0,"If they don't trust you, it's either that you gave them reason not to or they've decided not to because that's the kind of people they are. In either case, its unlikely they'll change, especially if it's the latter. Get good at sneaking around, it makes it more fun anyway. :)"
AmItheAsshole,femneb2,t1_fem442k,1579263612.0,"This, as well. Her college likely has a relevant degree course."
AmItheAsshole,fel4hhv,t1_fek8s7a,1579213867.0,"And I know a girl who got pregnant and raised a baby at 13, a different girl at 15, and I've never taken care of a baby at 28. Age doesn't really have anything to do with ability here, just level of skill/knowledge."
AmItheAsshole,fel3ywu,t1_fej8fys,1579213553.0,"Not to sound grim, but OP really has no way of knowing what Stella and her mom are like behind closed doors. 'Lecture' could mean something very different to Stella than it does to OP."
AmItheAsshole,fel1bxo,t1_fekzmd4,1579211926.0,"That's what I was thinking. It's one of those things where tone and context, which you can't really convey accurately online, can change the whole thing. Also, OP should absolutely learn how to swim for their own safety. Drowning is a terrible way to die."
AmItheAsshole,fel0rfs,t1_feky054,1579211589.0,"Even so, she could pursue acting while getting a degree, so she'll have something to fall back on. She's putting all her eggs in one precarious basket, which is dumb."
AmItheAsshole,fejvmts,t1_fejtx8g,1579186890.0,"Bingo. This is what a ton of people aren't understanding. Honesty is best, but it requires tact otherwise it's being an asshole."
AskReddit,fejktvk,t1_fejdeow,1579178271.0,It's just a normal slipknot.
AmItheAsshole,fegqqlg,t1_fefe3lm,1579100313.0,It's kind of worse than saying it about a dress. You can just put a new dress on. Hair dye can be a bitch to remove and you shouldn't process your hair too frequently or it could get severe damage. She's gonna have this pink for a while.
AmItheAsshole,fegq37m,t1_fefqbd8,1579099864.0,"My father was with my stepmom from the time I was 5 to when I was 15. In those 20 years, she was kind, loving, supportive, and every bit a mother to me as she could be. So when he decided to go be with some skank instead and told me I had to choose, I chose my stepmom. I didn't talk to my father much until after he'd broken up with said skank 5 years later. Family isn't about blood or marriage, it's about loving each other and just because my dad didn't love my stepmom anymore didn't mean 10 years of love and bonding just vanished."
AmItheAsshole,feetkjf,t1_fee863c,1579040916.0,It reminds me of the Ferengi from star trek. They don't allow their women to wear clothes.
aww,fe99x6j,t1_fe775x7,1578935688.0,People who say that have generally not had pets. Just like people who say cats don't love their owners usually haven't owned a cat.
badwomensanatomy,fdperwo,t1_fdoudb0,1578626762.0,Too small to register
AmItheAsshole,fdo1l9h,t1_fdn81mj,1578597206.0,I've never in my life adopted a cat from a shelter. I just took them in when I found them. That's a perfectly normal way to obtain a cat if you live in an area with lots of strays.
AmItheAsshole,fdnawi2,t1_fdm2256,1578581807.0,"It's not even the cleaning, the poor kitty must've been miserable. :("

technology,fd2q0z3,t1_fd0aabr,1578150543.0,"Even if everyone could easily learn to code, we don't need that many coders. We need people to work those low skill jobs or the entire system falls apart. Imagine how fucked you would be if every single person working a minimum wage job just stopped one day. The work needs doing, so we should pay people enough to be able to support themselves."
PublicFreakout,fcztc7y,t1_fcqtvui,1578108262.0,"To be fair, EA is the fucking worst."
AmItheAsshole,fcv13y4,t1_fcummhb,1577992486.0,I'd be surprised if her sister wanted to see her again after being so callous to her son. The damage OP did is going to last a while.
AmItheAsshole,fcku5dj,t1_fckr0wk,1577733250.0,"Don't forget the cuddling, which makes the problem worse. OP's wife is selfish af."
AmItheAsshole,fckk5zq,t1_fck2dv0,1577727105.0,That portion would definitely be more than $8 regardless.
insaneparents,fckhq3l,t1_fcjr5an,1577725585.0,"If you can't make your own food as an adult, you're damaged."
PublicFreakout,fcatbp0,t1_fc58cel,1577576202.0,The last time I heard of this happening it was an employee.
PublicFreakout,fc7dsc7,t1_fc6ubb4,1577504454.0,It could also be the bystander effect. Most people won't intervene regardless of who is doing the attacking.
AskReddit,fc7aiv4,t1_fc6v9v8,1577501880.0,Jfc humans are awful
aww,fc79keg,t1_fc6lifu,1577501141.0,It's voluntary in the sense that having any job is voluntary. But is it really a choice when the other option is abject poverty? This is the only way up for lots of people.
aww,fc78yku,t1_fc72h8o,1577500678.0,"College education, health insurance, stable income, to name a few."
childfree,fc713hq,t1_fc6moc4,1577494721.0,"Honestly, it can't be that hard to find a kid with a passing resemblance to you, though. People who didn't know better would say 'she looks just like you"" to both of my stepparents."
AmItheAsshole,fc6ropd,t1_fc6htdl,1577487761.0,"I wish I could see some hard numbers on how many of those divorces were from shotgun weddings. Of the five girls I knew that got married after getting teen pregnant, four are divorced."
AmItheAsshole,fc67cv5,t1_fc5zswu,1577473952.0,Food addiction is just as real as drug addiction. She's an addict.

AmItheAsshole,fbha7wl,t1_fbggwdd,1576868887.0,"I don't think they meant that it was good she died, just that the timing was such that they were prepared and already wanting another baby, which is fortunate for the baby who still gets to be raised by their blood family. I highly doubt that until two days ago either of them had even thought about adopting the baby as she already had a mother."
