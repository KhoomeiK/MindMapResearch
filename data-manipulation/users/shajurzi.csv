books,ff5cex7,t1_ff095ol,1579587163.0,I just finished flowers this week. It had an amazing effect on me. It will really create the demand for self-evaluation of how we treat others and how we perceive ourselves. Powerful book.

Wow. What an emotional rollercoaster. Will cause introspection on several levels.

Read it along time ago and remember being thrilled by it. Picking up again for another go."

politics,fe8v2f6,t1_fe8ru3j,1578931254.0,"Tough words but this is spot on. Sales guys bring the money in. I think it's hilarious people think sales is so easy but none of them try it. Minimize costs on deliver, maximize potential on revenue. It's pretty simple. Don't be mad, go start selling cars or insurance, knock on doors, work your way up to selling a cheap widget. Do well then get a job selling computers or some consumer tech. Be a leader there and move up to selling something more essential to businesses. Always be in the top 10% and work late, stay late. You can be a salesperson too. It's easy."
oddlysatisfying,fe71xhc,t3_eo05ii,1578908969.0,A bit deceptive. I'm 99% sure the video is sped up. He/she isn't writing that neat that quickly. Beautiful handwriting nonetheless.

If God was his motivation for doing what he did then to him God is justifiably good and no one should have anything to say about it."

Showerthoughts,fcn24pv,t1_fcn0z7a,1577801116.0,People also don't realize how many times they've used some connected search engine associated to look up things they spoke about. Most of the time it's not what we say but what we type. Cookies people!
todayilearned,fcmj50l,t1_fcm5gau,1577777382.0,"Good luck! I was with a startup right in Austin that was acquired by a large multinational corporation, founders in their later 30s as well. I've seen it happen!"
todayilearned,fcmiuik,t1_fcm6v3p,1577777040.0,I don't know about that. Working for a startup is high risk for potentially high reward. It's often thankless and a serious grind that is incredibly satisfying when things go right. It's a rollercoaster of emotions and takes a certain kind of insanity to do it willingly and repeatedly as many do. Working for a startup is no hobby.
todayilearned,fcmil2t,t1_fcmgpev,1577776728.0,"Mergers and acquisitions happen weekly in the US to the tune of billions. Big companies (including the ones you mention) buy up these startups to enhance their own business or acquire customers, capability and technology. Pointing out 5 gross outliers and leaving out hundreds of successful startups matching the pattern laid out in the article is leaving out most of the story."
