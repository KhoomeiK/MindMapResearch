DMAcademy,fel3h9p,t3_epkcub,1579213250.0,"For Rogue, where you have ""allow for situations where rogue specific skills would be useful"", I would just make that a general rule where you make sure to allow for situations where every class's skill can be useful at times.

But as for the rogue part, I would say to keep and maintain their under-worldly contacts, make more of them, and to stay under the law's nose.

For the monk, it would be to train. Perhaps they need to practice a given action or reaction before they could use it, or perhaps they need to learn it from a given master. Or, (and I might have to try this one out myself) they may have to succeed at it at a higher DC first in combat before they can begin to use it regularly, and that would give it the feeling like they truly worked at it and earned it rather than just, ""Okay, I'm fifth level now. I can do this.""

For the bard, I can imagine them having to seek out the material for their magic, traveling to far off colleges to find that one record of that one song, going to that hamlet to hear that one fisherman's limerick or poem, etc.

worldbuilding,fehygnv,t3_eohwwo,1579126404.0,"I prefer a lie magic setting, one where magic is very uncommon and is because of that distrusted.

From a practical point of view, it puts a social check on the players use of magic within certain contexts, but also makes their ability to use it that much more unique and special within the world. 

Could you imagine if a cleric healed a man injured by a cart? That person would be inundated by people looking for healing for miles around.

Could you imagine if a character used thaumaturgy to dim lights and rattle some shutters? If anything bad happens within that town, if a crop fails, or a person goes missing, who will the suspicious superstitious lot of the town blame? That weird person who did that weird thing.

DnD,febvzjf,t3_eoddre,1578963401.0,"The person who creates the world, the dungeon master or the game master, sets the parameters of the world. If that person decides that there are no people in this world with machines for arms, then that’s it. If you want him or her to make an exception to the world or the rules (there’s currently no race or class in D&D 5th edition that has machine guns for arms), I suggest making a really interesting reason why, and to make sure that the exception isn’t game breaking: takes away the challenge of the game. One way to do that is to Erskine something in the game, that is to take an existing accepted rule, like that for arrow, and use those rules for the machine gun. It might not be as exciting, but as least it won’t changed the game in a way that it loses its challenges.
