You know who you are, and what you deserve and want, so why continue to subject yourself to this guy's mental instability? I would cut him off immediately. Also, I think it will be important for you to address what attracted and kept you with this type of individual for this amount of time, so that you will be in a far healthier and happier relationship next time.

Wish you strength and all the best."

Other than that, make sure the arrangement serves *you* and be open to re-assessing or ending it if you find you're starting to become invested in a different outcome (relationship).

From my experience, I find it hard to keep casual 'casual', given the actual and emotional risks involved, so I've opted out altogether. If you can do it, power to you. Just make sure you keep yourself healthy."
