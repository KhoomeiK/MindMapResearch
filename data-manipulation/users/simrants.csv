Try not to make comments that have a pure intention but could be taken in the wrong way: eg. “I know how you feel”, or things that she is tired of hearing: eg. “I’m sorry.” Get her food. Do her chores. And ask if she’d like a hug, make sure it’s consensual as some people prefer not to be touched in such a difficult time, but others love it."
