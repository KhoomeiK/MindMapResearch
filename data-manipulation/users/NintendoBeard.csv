Dogfree,ff233hd,t3_er6cqk,1579492485.0,"This is brilliant and very funny. The key to not letting these people ruin our day, as you said it's important, is to realize how clearer our minds are, how better are our lives without subservience. So the vivid descriptors you gave, that's exactly how to remind ourselves how much better we have it.  ""Syllables shriveling in the frozen air like their discarded pride."" Hah!! This was a great read"

exchristian,fevx207,t3_eqqokk,1579402556.0,"I would recommend meditation, just ten minutes a day.  I'm lucky if I remember/have time to do it twice a week, but I love it when I do.  Waking Up and Headspace are good apps with some free lessons to get the general idea.

As you said, going to the gym is great too.  It gives you that ""bettering yourself"" feeling that church used to"

starterpacks,fdv0r99,t1_fdsyncy,1578741845.0,"Tbh I don't get why this is on the list. Maybe the wording of it as a ""personality trait"" doesn't fit, but if I had to sum up what I do in my spare time, even just an hour of reddit every day is quite a significant portion. Plus, keeping up with news, knowing memes, certain humor, liking cat/dog videos... are these not more or less personality traits?"

atheism,fcioe64,t1_fcgtsjo,1577666067.0,"In case a theist asks, okay so where does empathy come from? As you said near the end of the comment, the biggest reason I agree not to harm others is ultimately because I don't want to be harmed myself. This is where I'd drop another of my favorite sayings of Hitch: there's no way our ancestors wandered around for 100,000 years and waited til they reached Mt. Sinai to discover not to kill and steal from each other. It's simply because we don't want to be killed or stolen from, so as a whole, it is a win-win move to follow the most basic 'commandments.'"
