neoliberal,fffw2to,t1_fffab98,1579893065.0,"I don’t think that’s an honest portrayal of Bloomberg’s impact. Yes, he plans to skip 75% of the first states, but that’s 3 states that make up 3.5% of total delegates - admittedly an oversimplification if you believe in Iowa/NH momentum. 

He’s pouring most of his money into Super Tuesday states, which include larger and more diverse states, so he certainly has a chance of picking up congressional delegates that could reallocate to Bernie closer to the convention. I agree he’s a long-shot for many state-wide delegates. 

I may have read the same article as you that said most polling doesn’t have him winning a single delegate, including congressional ones. But we’re 5 or 6 weeks out from Super Tuesday, he’s done better than expected in the short time since he’s entered, and polling today can’t reflect the inordinate amounts of money he’ll spend between now and March (including the Super Bowl ad). I personally don’t expect him to be a spoiler for Biden/Buttigieg, but there is a realistic path to it happening.

Edit: grammar"

neoliberal,fdj86z4,t1_fdj6kjr,1578461220.0,"Do you follow sports? Sometimes, the clearly better team will make a few boneheaded mistakes along the way that leaves us with a close game at the end of the 4th quarter. Then the referee makes a call that ultimately results in the better team losing.

The referee’s calls (in this metaphor, Comey reopening the investigation) is out of the better team’s (Clinton’s campaign) control. What was in their control were the mistakes that led them to the situation in which it was close enough to swing on a last minute call.

The Comey letter didn’t automatically mean Clinton wins or loses. No one event does that in a campaign. She lost a small share of her support because of it, but she was in a position where that small share could have swung 3 or 4 major battleground states (partially because of choices made by the campaign, partially because of sexism and other factors not in her control).

And to your point about Bernie voters‘ lack of support for Clinton cost her the election, that’s an easily misinterpretation of the data. Usually when you have to cite a Reddit comment, your argument isn’t very valid. WaPo has a good write up on it, but the truth is: (1) Many Bernie-Trump supporters voted (R) in prior elections, but people like to assume party affiliation based on one vote (2) Per CCES and a recent 538 article (a bit more reputable than what you linked, where both sides were ill-informed), Clinton-McCain voters were about as common as Bernie-Trump supporters, and ultimately Clinton supporters in ‘08 deflected Obama as much as Bernie’s did Hillary. Yet Obsma coasted to (I believe) a 7-point victory.

Honestly, one thing I enjoy about this sub is users are usually pretty honest with themselves, not blinding themselves to evidence just because it doesn’t confirm their priors. This is the first discussion I’ve had here that’s full of fallacies and points easily refuted by well-circulated data.

I said sexism was very prevalent in the election cycle, yet you felt the need to tell me sexism exists....  did you respond to the wrong person? 

And Bernie’s the last Dem candidate, of those polling above 2%, who I’d support. So even your ad hominems are misguided bullshit."

Call out sexism where it actually exists, and that’s easily done because it was prevalent in many facets of that election cycle. This isn’t it. Her team’s strategy deserves criticism for losing once Democratic strongholds, and it resulted in the largest wrong-direction quality swing in the modern era I could think of."

msu,fcttflh,t1_fc9wr2g,1577958594.0,"I find it interesting how inflated the public’s sense of money and how much school name bumps your pay is. Harvard graduates’ median salary out of school is between $60k and $70k. It’s fair to assume this kid is at least somewhat ambitious and intelligent, considering he got into Harvard, so he’ll probably do fine financially coming out of any big university. And without the ridiculous private school bill, that would be nice.

Short of wanting to go into academia, graduate school, or down a somewhat niche career path (think tanks, etc.), forecasting outcomes - especially financial ones - shouldn’t weigh too heavily on this decision."

I’ll also add that to my reading list, and if that book mostly confirmed your priors, I hope you’ve considered a couple that don’t. Academically Adrift and Where Do Funds Go (I think both recommended by Bill Gates) are two great ones.

I don’t think the charter school system is the end-all solution to inequitable education evident in different circle of wealth and race. But there are some interesting innovations being employed at some, and I think that’s necessary to have. 

While I’ll admit Gates is the product of a problem, I’d stop short of saying he’s a problem himself. I’m not sure why you think it makes his philanthropy, from making HIV treatments more readily available in countries most affected to trying to yield a resurgence in malaria, any less respectable because it’s done overseas. But that’s a separate discussion to have.

Foodforthought,fcid22p,t1_fciaxvf,1577660740.0,"Showing a bias is pointing out that “all charter school are bad” isn’t true no matter how you spin it? I think the bias comes when making that huge generalization. I’m starting my career in education consulting (private, charter, public k-12 all included) next year, and to get that job had to read dozens of policy papers and research that have moved me from one far end of the spectrum, to the other, and back to somewhere in the middle. If you can’t admit some charter schools are run in a way that lead to better outcomes and reduced wealth/racial inequality, you’re in a group with the guy listening to podcasts titled “the charter school scam” and will never come around. Tired of people turning blind when presented with 50 years of data showing diminishing returns to public school funding. Combatting innovation with “no, no - just keep throwing more money at it. It’s get better.” is insanity."
