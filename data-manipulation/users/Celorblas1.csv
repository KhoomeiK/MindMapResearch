But ultimately you'll get the most nanites and units if you treat it like it's your life. Go out, find something that is interesting, and do it. If you want to build a base, focus on that. Fill that bitch full of useful stuff like a farm and do thee missions for your terminals. If you like to explore, get an explorer ship and start warping around and scanning stuff.
