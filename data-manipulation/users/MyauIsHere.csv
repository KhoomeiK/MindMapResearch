I've started feeling love and trust and friendship again I see that it was never lost I just wasn't ready for it with how I was feeling. 

My mom always says, be patient, everything will fall into place."
socialanxiety,ffirego,t1_ffiqhvy,1579980820.0,"I think that's a common quality of it.
We surpress so much of who we are in front of people that we lose sight of it. We see someone who isn't truly who we are and that messes with you man. I feel you about only being youself when you're alone. I've dug myself even deeper in the past and even felt uncomfortable alone.
Now a lot of things from back when still echo here and there but have lost their strength. 

You have to push youself to stay who you are even when you feel judged and unloved. Cause you know damn well it's a projection of your mind and not how people really feel about you. Open youself up a little and you'll see that you are loved. 

That's been my experience at least."
socialanxiety,ffiq1co,t1_ffipsp3,1579979866.0,Why would that be true? Bad how?
socialanxiety,ffipzie,t1_ffiovyh,1579979829.0,"At my worst in the past I felt like it's all I was. Just kind of nothing, or a problem that's alive. Don't do that to yourself, it's not you, it's just feelings and thoughts that disrupt our life."
socialanxiety,ffilfka,t1_ffikr59,1579976685.0,Yessss!! It's so important to get rid of that bad feeling after failure. Ofc you'll fail we can't become the life of the party overnight. Going into social situations more open about how it'll turn out and knowing you'll be okay either way is a good sign of progress.

coldshowers,felltfl,t3_epsss9,1579225245.0,Same here but I did it
AskReddit,fekdp5y,t1_fef078v,1579197885.0,"Yeah that damn default mode network, which scientist or what not pinpoint it as where the ego resides. The damn thing making us suffer for no damn reason. It can also move around and split, which makes our self image that more confusing.

I'm looking forward to doing shrooms and seeing where it takes me."
AskReddit,fekd6gu,t1_feezigj,1579197576.0,That's a scary thing for a kid to go though. I guess it's all a combination of nature and nurture. Genes sure play a role but also how much oh how little love and attention you were given as a child. How much you were praised and how much criticised.
AskReddit,feez4c9,t1_feexvo8,1579044408.0,"You get to know your inner world pretty well when it's controlling your life, I'm sure you've felt the same. Now with the knowledge and will there's no other place to go but up ( and a psychiatrist :D 
Self pity, a victim mentality and self doubt are weirdly alluring and put a break on healing , I think subconsciously we like to hurt ourselves and stay in the comfortable known, instead of freeing ourselves and living in spontaneity.

About the medicine, cannabis was the ""culprit"" for all this pain, or more so brought up what was eventually going to come out naturally.
And shrooms, I've been thinking about doing them for some time now, there's no more fear of repercussions in me, good trip or bad, the teacher knows best.

I'd like to hear your experience with them if you wanna share."
AskReddit,feewni6,t1_feewcy6,1579042821.0,"Yeah, doing the things you love and make you happy really do shift things in your mind.
I love to bake and clean too, it always puts me in a good mood."
AskReddit,feewheg,t1_feevih3,1579042720.0,"Wow your story resonates with me so damn much 

I am the same, very anxious. All cultivated from childhood and relationships trauma.
When I start to adapt these habits my life changes but I fall off the tracks cause I kinda don't trust that they'll work, when there's so much evidence that they do. Stubborn ego af.
When I eventually overcome this stuff I wanna be a psychiatrist or a psychologist too.
People who felt the deepest pain and crawled themselves out know what's up.

I'm thinking of getting myself on meds too, but idk maybe I'd feel like I've failed somehow if I do.

It's very good to hear that someone who once struggled is doing amazingly now :) nois"

Do you do this stuff? If so how has it changed your daily life?"
AskReddit,feeui68,t1_feetvlr,1579041492.0,"Those are good but as you said, that's a long term process and new habit building stuff.
I mean more in the sense lf immediate and challaging things like the example."
AskReddit,feetud0,t1_feetgin,1579041080.0,"Yeah
It's a fuck you to the weak mind, you don't want to do it, it sucks, but it's a challange. You surprise youself by enduring it and see that you're capabilities are bigger than you thought."
