unpopularopinion,fgo1wi9,t1_fgnurab,1580957870.0,"Just as a quick note, homelessness in the UK is effectively defined as not having somewhere permanent to go home to, which allows statisticians to include loads of broken families who live in hotels/short-term accomodation in with thousands of men who have literally nowhere to sleep at night.    
This bodges the numbers from almost 100% male to the ones quoted, 75% or so nowadays, and then we get posters saying ""1 in 4 homeless are women!!!"", because that is obviously their priority. The very few who have been homeless as in your example are the absolute priority of all the shelters nowadays, men don't get a look in.

You ask why so many of your military are going homeless? Try this scenario: Army vet starts having mental health issues, while still in uniform. He gets out, goes to live somewhere with wife and kids, mental health issues get worse because of the lack of structure that he's used to. Situation blows up, wife gets kids and house, man gets tossed to the kerb.    
Why does this situation occur almost everytime? Because the family courts favour the woman over the man almost every time. I wonder who could have influenced them over the last 30 or so years to that conclusion?

The problem is, government funding for social care is limited, which turns it into a zero-sum game. The more given to women means less for men, and the more given to men means less for women. Which is why feminists scream loudly to reduce or prevent any form of actual help for men being set up. Trying to claim that feminists don't do this is ridiculous, there are so many examples of it online nowadays."

Again the moon has an advantage in that it has a micro gravity as opposed to no gravity which would be user-friendly for the crew. I'm not familiar with test results on zero G effects, but common sense would appear to indicate some gravity would be less harmful than no gravity at all.
