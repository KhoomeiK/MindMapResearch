BanPitBulls,fflzbim,t3_eu6sej,1580046032.0,"It's incredible how much these dogs look like the pitbulls of today. 

Here's a very straightforward breakdown of how it went down:

>The Old English Bulldog was bred for막ull-baiting. Its life depended on a fighting tactic of ""go low, pin, and hold"". Such a breed was unsuitable for맋og fighting말n the ""pit"". Once an Old English Bulldog got a good grip, there would be little left for the spectators to see, except for two dogs gripping each other, closing their jaws tighter and tighter.
Required were quick attacks, new grips, and tricks, which made up the drama of a dog fight that appealed to spectators,많amblers, and dog owners. The introduction of English Terrier blood provided longer legs, fiery temperament, and speed, which provided entertaining fights.
The crossing of bulldog and terrier produced a dog that no longer belonged entirely to either맍oundation stock. With attributes such as ferociousness, aggressiveness, and intelligence, there were few fighting tasks a bull-and-terrier could not perform better than other breeds of those times.
In 1835, with the banning of막aiting, the breed was placed in jeopardy of extinction; however, while막ull-baiting마nd막ear-baiting맓aws were enforced, dog fighting flourished, so the bull-and-terrier lived on. Around 1860, the type split into two branches, increasingly standardised over time into distinct breeds: the pure whiteBull Terrier, and the coloured forms that lived on for another 70 years in the dog pit until they finally were recognized as a legitimate dog breed called theStaffordshire Bull Terrier.[4]ㅁround the same time, many lower-class Irish and Englishmen were emigrating to America with their terrier됵ulldog crossbreeds, including from both of those developing bloodlines. Over time, the descendants of these dogs became taller and heavier. Their masters opted for a dog that was both an aggressive warrior in the gambling dens of the cities and saloons but also was a working dog, its terrier and bulldog blood from Ireland and the UK proving to be very useful in farm work and in hunting. The breed was officially recognized as theㅁmerican Pit Bull Terrier말n 1898 and later its close kin theㅁmerican Staffordshire Terrier말n 1936."

I've also wondered if maybe my most recent past life was in a male body, and if that's part of the reason I was so outraged by and resistant to female socialization. I wonder if souls that conform more readily to female socialization have been through a few consecutive cycles as female, and have gotten so used to being treated as lesser that they have become resigned to it, and even maybe started to try to make the inescapable role work to their advantage."

worldnews,fff6t1w,t1_ffecovo,1579877172.0,"It does come from the animal. The B12 is produced by bacteria inside the stomach, for ruminants at least, and accumulates in the tissues. Wherever the bacteria may initially come from (edit: the initial dose for a mammal comes from its mother's milk), it's inaccurate to say that they get b12 directly from the soil (or even if they do, they produce more than they ingest directly). 

Our own digestive system doesn't allow for absorption of the b12 our gut bacteria produce, instead we excrete it. So a major physiological difference exists there, meaning that we cannot accumulate b12 in our tissues simply by eating soil bacteria to the same extent that ruminants can. Instead, we have to directly ingest B12. So that means trying to get sufficient actual b12 (not just b12-producing bacteria) from the soil. 

Using the example of gorillas and how they eat soil and their own feces to gain sufficient b12 is only relevant up to a point, and that point is: the common ancestor or both humans and gorillas was an omnivorous primate that ate meat, insects and so on. As a species that regularly consumed animal products, they had a mechanism for obtaining sufficient b12 and no selection pressure existed to evolve a new one. Ruminants on the other hand, although they eat meat opportunistically, can't obtain it regularly enough and so had to develop a digestive system that allowed a fermentation chamber for b12 producing bacteria to thrive, one sited high enough that the b12 can be accumulated prior to excretion. 

In very recent evolutionary history, gorillas have evolved to be vegetarian, and humans even more recently have invented the concept of veganism. This has left the gorillas needing to eat their own shit (which will continue until pathogenic illnesses or other deleterious consequences of doing so create a selection pressure to find an alternative) and humans needing to find supplements and so on. 

Who knows, in another few million years maybe we will all evolve to be more like ruminants, with a digestive system capable of producing and accumulating b12. But for now, we have wildly different nutritional requirements, and just because cows can get enough b12 from dirt, doesn't mean it's a reliable mechanism for humans."

Given how prolonged each stage of life is for humans compared to our closest chimp relatives, and how many reproductive changes we have gone through in our evolutionary journey to becoming human, it certainly stands to reason that there is an (edit: even longer) ""subadult"" stage in humans too, where sexual maturity has been reached but reproduction is generally not done until a few years later, when the body has developed further in the various ways that make fully mature women more capable of carrying healthy babies compared to barely-pubescent adolescents."

I'm now in the process of separating from him. 

From his pov, he is just so into me and just can't resist me and loves me and wants me (and only me) so much, and why am I being so cold in rejecting him when all he wants to do is love me? And when he tries to push past my boundaries for the umpteenth time and I'm like, ok, enough, the moment is ruined, he's like she's rejecting me, why?! No matter how many times I beg him to understand that he can't just treat my body like he's entitled to it, and that when he starts to treat me like he's entitled to my body, it makes me shut down. Every time, we have the same cycle. And he still is just as into me as he ever was, but I've shut down more and more to the point that I just can't wait for it to be over. Fortunately we don't have children together to complicate the situation.  

Anyway like I said, I'm not directly comparing your situation to mine, I'm just pointing out that there can be some very complex and nuanced reasons for sexual attraction to change into reserve, disinterest, or even outright hostility. 

In regard to your above comment however, I will say that if my partner was scrolling through Instagram images of girls he found attractive, picturing me wearing their outfits, and then attempting to start up something with me, I would feel objectified and turned off in that scenario. Like, you're putting someone in a fantasy role they haven't asked to be in, mentally dressing them up and wanting them to perform to your idea of what's hot. Personally, that doesn't really do it for me. I prefer an actual mental connection, and it sounds like your partner may not be finding that in you, if she's as indifferent as you say.

If enough of us did it, we might not hold back the collapse completely but we might still do a lot to mitigate the worst of it. Maybe see if you can get him enthusiastic about volunteering on workaway.com or something like it? Everyone is so disaffected right now but if we had a common sense of purpose that disaffection could be replaced by a massive surge of productive energy. And with the way capitalism is collapsing around us, as you say, in 5-10 years things will be very different. We need to start building a collectivized society from the ground up, and this is the only way to do it. I'd rather die fighting than knowing I did nothing, and I'm sure there are plenty of people that feel the same way."

For blizzards: harder to find statistics, but apparently the deadliest in history was Iran in 1972, which killed 4,000 people. 

I mean given how frequent blizzards are in blizzard-prone areas compared to how frequent lethal volcanic eruptions are, I'm not sure what your probability is of dying of one or the other on any given day. But still, a volcanic eruption when it does hit can be fifteen times as deadly as a blizzard."

Cycling is also good for that, as you can just slip around quickly and quietly without much fuss. If you live anywhere near a natural area, maybe try a bike ride out to the country with a picnic and a book, or even a camping trip... or even see if there are permaculture farms or nature reserves that could use a little voluntary help? There are also sites like WWOOF and workaway for rural volunteering jobs.

Really, the more I try to put myself in her place the harder it is to imagine what she was thinking.

Could explain her getting rid of her phone at some earlier time, even."
