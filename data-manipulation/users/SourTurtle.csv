Peak winter our heating bill for 65F was like $400. I don’t know how 50F yields a $1000 bill unless she’s just keeping the doors open and running electric heaters in every room."

food,fckj8d7,t1_fchju68,1577726528.0,"So, I’ve been trying to duplicate Jet’s for a while without much success. My dough usually ends up too dense on the inside instead of airy and fluffy (I think my issue is not letting it rise for 2 hours in a sealed container). I’ve been putting it directly in the pan, covering for an hour, pressing out the bubbles and stretching to the sides.
