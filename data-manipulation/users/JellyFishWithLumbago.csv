Despite all that we as a population are also the most miserable creatures on the planet, man it gets you thinking."

instant_regret,fecoi47,t3_eo9cqx,1578979148.0,"This sorta reminds me of the time my brother, sister and I were playing around the backyard as kids in the early 2000s did but one day we got tired of pulling worms from the ground and feeding ants to spiders. Anyway we were being little bastards and throwing stones until my brother picks up this huge brick and starts bragging that he could throw it across the garden so me and my sister travelled down the garden. My ass being smarter than the pair I hid in a slight dip in the ground but my sister thought she was tough as nails and decided that she'd cross her arms at the end of he garden (it was like 8 yards in distance between them) suddenly it all starts, my dumbass brother starts spinning in a circle with this huge brick and yells ""Duck"" my sister wouldn't duck for some reason and boom, it happened a brick to the face. I've never heard such a horrible scream in my entire life there's something about hearing someone you love dearly scream in such a bloodcurdling way. Long story short she went to the hospital and her right cheek bone had broken entirely. Just writing out this post brings back the horrible scream and how my chest felt like it had just been ripped from my body with guilt."
