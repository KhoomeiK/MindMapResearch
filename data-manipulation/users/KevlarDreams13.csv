It happens, naturally, every now and then. Biggest known causes are stress and fear.

>for all the cool stuff u can do

You will never have ""control"" in the way these cultists promise. There have been exactly zero ""in control"" lucid dreamers observed by science, although it doesn't stop these people from screaming from the rooftops that they have this ability.

The meat suits we are issued are weird, and will behave oddly from time to time, because the human mind/body was not engineered, it just is a concequence of life. We all wants super powers, unfortunately, they don't exist. I know it's boring and isn't the answer you were looking for, but learning will always be better than our idea of ""fun""."
IWantToLearn,fdicnwi,t3_el99y4,1578439894.0,"Wow, this thread is chock full of pseudoscience and terrible advice on ""supplements""

Having control over lucid dreaming is not a real thing, and lucid dreaming is not a gateway to ""transcendent consciousness"" any more than nightmares are.

But, if you are feeling like a fool that loves to part ways with money for quackery,  you can purchase books, tapes, scientific publications and induction devices, such as the DreamLight ($1,200), the DreamSpeaker ($150) or the NovaDreamer ($275), from LaBerge's Lucidity Institute. For $2,000 you can attend a seminar at a beautiful tropical resort where you can learn all the latest techniques to help you tap into your ""unconscious mind,"" an absolute necessity for living the good life. For an additional $35 you can even get 2.0 units of nursing continuing education credit through the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology. 

My advice, don't listen to any of these Birkenstock-wearing retards. Look for peer reviewed scientific studies on this topic, you will learn very much. Also, DO NOT TAKE ANY ""SUPPLEMENTS"" suggested to you in this thread. Research the active ingredients in anything you plan to fuck with.

Again, avoid the advice of uneducated hippies and remember that LaBerge was a quack. I hope to have stroked your skepticism a little bit today, but the rest is on you."
