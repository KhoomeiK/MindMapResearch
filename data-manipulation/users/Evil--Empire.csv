Imanlgine yourself at their age feeling the same way. Now you can have that feeling of a new lease on life and can do things differently."
selfimprovement,fcxp2i5,t3_ejbife,1578068149.0,"I'm in 30s and just getting around to the same thoughts so congratulations on making this realization at a young age.

I'd recommend writing out goals and steps to get to those goals that are actually just smaller goals.

Plan out your days. Physical (create a work out routine and hold yourself accountable. Mental (learn and study new skills, read books.) Emotional (again read books but also see about talking to a counselor at school or a therapist).  There's no shame in this it will only make you better if you can let go of some baggage. 

Join activities you want to do but scare you. Example, boxing classes because you fear confrontation. Follow through. You will gain confidence and self esteem.

Realize that you have many opportunities everyday to do something nice for other people. Give them your best without wanting anything in return.

Cut back on your phone and social media if you spend time checking feeds all day. I'd bet if you step away for two days and then check them, you didn't miss anything but saved hours of time where you got to work on yourself rather than compared yourself to a curated image of someone else's (fake) life.

Most of all realize you are already enough the way you are. Open up to love and to be loved. Be vulnerable.

Be courageous, get out of your comfort zone, make plans, and show people your light. In the end everyone is mortal. You don't need to be fearless but you MUST be brave.

Good luck on your journey."
