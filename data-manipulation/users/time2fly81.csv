Why don't Christians revise the bible to remove all the archaic, primitive, abusive and downright cruel verses and just keep the feel good metaphors that tell us we're all equals and we should love each other? Why not remove the supernatural claims that are completely unfounded? Thomas Jefferson did it (Jeffersonian bible).

We will not be attacking religion in this group, only addressing ineffective ideas that are often indoctrinated into us from a young age and exploring the alternatives.

Depending on how deeply a person believed in their faith and the version of reality they were taught, acknowledging they are questioning their faith can be a confusing time. Wanting to leave their faith can be terrifying depending on how tied into their religion they are. Aside from families and friends ex-communicating them, they are also left wondering what's next when their world view is no longer valid and they want to form a new one. This is why so many people go from being religious to being ""spiritual"". A quick search on meetup will show you how many Eastern and metaphysical spiritual groups have popped up in Wichita as people leave traditional religions.

This group intends to bridge the gap and help people transition into non-belief in a healthy way. We'll help them find answers to their questions and concerns, but also explore evidence-based methods for living a more fulfilling life. These methods can be used by anybody to improve one or all areas of their life, without relying on supernatural claims. And yes, there is also a social benefit to making new friends. Or feel free to just come and observe, it would great to meet you.

TLDR: This group intends to help people in any phase of leaving a belief system, and those who were raised without religion. The evidence based methods for self-improvement can be of absolute value to you as well. All without promising you things that can't be delivered, or asking for money :)"
