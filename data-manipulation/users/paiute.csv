HomeImprovement,ffi84kh,t3_etrgyb,1579967559.0,"If you build an enclosure around the radiator with baffles/grilles as in the link you provided, you will reduce the airflow around the radiator. Why not design an enclosure which incorporates a fan? Some smallish air mover like a simple computer fan, maybe one drawing room air into the enclosure and another pushing it out? Turned on by a thermostat which turns on the fans when the room is below a certain temp? I have often thought of such a device to put under my radiator - which is the old convector style from the 50s - to make the heat transfer to the room more efficient than just relying on passive convection air movement. With all the high tech energy toys about today, why isn't this a thing?"
