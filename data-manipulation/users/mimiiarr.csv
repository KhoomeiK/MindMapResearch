unpopularopinion,fdx7v11,t3_en8ggt,1578766169.0,"I have mix feelings about this. I'd say I agree about 70% disagree 30%.

I agree because it makes sense.. The world is more globalized than ever and cultures can't be expected not to mix especially in metropolitan cities

The 30% disagreement comes from personal experience.. I'm a part of a small religious minority in my country (less than 10% of the population). We face prejudice/inequality like most minorities of any kind. 
HOWEVER, since our religion is more widespread/popular globally, the other locals have started to imitate many aspects of out culture.. They participate in our holiday celebrations (which used to be banned until recently), name their kids our names (which we were persecuted/killed over in the past) etc..

And while I'm sure they don't do it with bad intentions we still feel a little bit protective over our identity since our ancestors literally died to preserve for us."
