KratomKorner,ffkhdb5,t1_ffinvuc,1580022782.0,"I’ve literally never heard of a physician drug testing patients to make sure they are taking the rx meds...but legally they are required to administer random drug tests at least once every calendar year to ensure you aren’t using illegal drugs, bc then they will take away your script. That’s the law in TX, at least. Especially as a mental health professional (social worker, not a physician of any kind) it’s so odd that they’d be like “oh you’re not positive, guess you don’t need it,,” bc most benzos are prescribed as needed, and often in small quantities that people don’t take all that often, ha. I could see them wanting to know if you aren’t taking it yourself, as you could be selling it, but I’ve never heard of a doc taking away the rx bc you didn’t test positive for it, lol. That’s fucking stupid, especially considering most physicians don’t encourage long term or daily use of benzos, unless literally nothing else tried works for an unmanageable level of symptoms."
KratomKorner,ffhp1x2,t3_etm6gh,1579946289.0,Do they conduct any sort of follow up labs to verify the result? Every time I read about drug tests it seems like there really are a multitude of situations that could cause false negatives.

I’m usually pretty savvy when it comes to understanding that part, but this one was pretty confusing, lol. Appreciate the info! Thanks."
Drugs,ffejkfx,t1_ffeij1z,1579850658.0,"It’s not even a wreck from rec drugs, which is why it’s so damn annoying, lol. I basically found out that the Cymbalta I’ve been on for a year and a half is the entire reason that I’ve been suffering from awful mood instability. 

PSA guys—SNRIs can put you at risk of experiencing cycling moods, AKA—you can have MDD and then start having mood shifts that push you closer to the bipolar end of the spectrum. So it’s really a blast when you’re trying to get better, and then get on a med that starts making you question your own fuckin sanity!"
