TransLater,fe8u2zf,t1_fe6xlku,1578930870.0,That's the truth!
TransLater,fe6hwfb,t1_fe5z65y,1578891415.0,"I am happy to act as a sounding board. And the shit they have done to intersex people over the years is nightmare fuel.

I can clearly see that you recognize the situation you are in, and know it's not healthy for you (or them to be honest) in the long run. 

The two that I was involved with were friends in highschool. They were a couple, but I connected on a deep level with the girl. Eventually it turned into unrequited love and I watched him cheat on her and ignore her and generally treat her like crap, while I tried to ignore my feelings and stay friends with him.

It went on like that for years, I was roommates with them for years too, and his brother was an alcoholic nut job while her mom was a paranoid schizophrenic. So there was a lot of chaos in that house that took its toll on me over the years. I still talk to her fairly frequently, but now it's from a distance and a long enough time period that it doesn't trigger my old patterns with her, though I know the potential is there to get dragged back into their drama. They have been married for almost 30 years now and it's been endless drama for the entire time. 

I guess what I am getting at is that after some time of being away from them and some self reflection and self live you can still be friends, but you need that distance. 

Honestly it's a little eerie how similar your situation is to what I experienced. 

Keep thinking about it as much as you need to, but keep your own self preservation in mind. I have been where you are and I can sympathize with you. 

Love, Iana"
TransLater,fe5r1x6,t1_fe5q3l0,1578873334.0,"You are not the problem, banish that from your thoughts. I empathize because I was once caught up in a toxic triangle too. The circumstances were different but the result was the same. Eventually I got out and my life got ever so much better, though it took another two decades to come to terms with my transness, so you are ahead of me on that count!

The main reason I responded is because I remember what that time was like, and I wouldn't wish it on anybody, and also to let you know that there is life after chaos. 

Take care of yourself sister!"
TransLater,fe5oz2v,t3_enr8pp,1578872443.0,"Best of luck to you Lilly, but it really sounds like you need to get out of that environment. Your circumstances are chaotic and and unhealthy for anyone, but you have enough to deal with on your own without all of the stuff they have been bringing into your life. 

I don't mean to add salt to the wounds, but I am concerned about your situation.  Sometimes people mean well but they are toxic in spite of themselves and it sounds like your friend is one of them. 

I hope it all works out for you!

Iana"
MtF,fe1gf2g,t3_enexil,1578826260.0,"Ad victoriam, sister!"
MtF,fdjbp9d,t3_ellbp3,1578464458.0,"My divorce happened differently, but it was no less about my gender dysphoria. Everything in my life up to that point was colored by that pain and confusion. She left me before I came out, but the walls between us, and the difficulty with intimacy and inability to have children were all driven by my inability to understand or accept myself. 

I only say all of this so I can say how much the last paragraph resonates with me. I am not happy, but I am at peace with myself. It's better than the veneer of happiness I had stretched over a broken soul.

I am sorry that it ended the way it did for you, but I am happy that you found peace with yourself as Dana."
ask_transgender,fdi45qi,t3_elhn35,1578435409.0,"There are plenty of cis women who enjoy taking the ""masculine"" role in intercourse, and inverse is true for men. What you enjoy doesn't change what you are. Do what makes you happy and fulfilled."

transpositive,fdhgnp0,t3_elcdub,1578422244.0,So happy for you! You look great!
MtF,fdbi74d,t1_fd9daxo,1578257610.0,"I had the same problems with shaving and waxing. Ultimately I decided to get laser hair reduction done. It was a huge relief to me as far as dysphoria goes. It's not cheap but in the long run it's cheaper than waxing and as long as you have good contrast between your hair and skin it works really well! Good luck, there are a lot of is who know what you are going through and we are all pulling for you sister!!"
aww,fd7i931,t3_ek5c7b,1578204953.0,It's almost eerie how much your dog looks like mine. Do mind if I ask what breed she is? Mine is a Shiba Inu and Italian Greyhound mix.
ask_transgender,fcvfkl5,t3_eivjw5,1578001050.0,"I had very similar feelings for many years.  Like you I realized at a very young age, and similarly understood that according to the world around me it wasn't okay for me to want to be a girl. 

I had the same feelings that maybe it was a fetish, or I was just a crossdresser (also not okay in general society, but one step up from a transexual (gen x here, no transgender back in my day lol). 

Even after I finally started to understand what it meant to be transgender it was still treated as a mental disorder so I suppressed it out of fear of my family and friends reactions. It wasn't until a couple of years ago I finally broke through all of that and reached acceptance. 

As another poster said, if you have felt this way since the age of 7 it's unlikely that it's a fetish or kink. However even if it is a kink, that's perfectly fine. You wouldn't be causing anyone harm by dressing up and appreciating how sexy it makes you feel. 

Best advice I can give is find a therapist who works with trans and GNC people and explore these feelings. No matter what realization you come to, you are valid and we live and support you!"
ask_transgender,fcveclx,t1_fcuf8ct,1578000329.0,"Yeah, that's the way it was for me. I think in a way, I felt that if I was forced into it, it absolved me of any responsibility for what I was, while also making all of my fear and objections irrelevant. 

Of course, it ignored all of the other issues with those fantasies, such as consent and respect for yourself and others."
aww,fcslkwv,t3_eifgep,1577919109.0,"I did the same for my dog before he passed away. My other dog isn't phased by them, but Murray was terrified so I always spent NYE with him tucked up under my arm while we watched tv."
aww,fcsl0v6,t1_fcqi8yv,1577918747.0,He was laughing and pulled his hoodie on. I think it was more about getting bear slobber all over his head since the hood isn't going to stop those teeth.
toastme,fcp5yzs,t3_ei4aw2,1577851566.0,Proud of you!  Just take it one step at a time! You can do this!!!
cats,fcl2bao,t3_eho3ij,1577738270.0,"I had to do the same for a cat and a dog last year. It is hard, but you are doing what's best for him. I know what you are feeling and just want to offer you my sympathies. He is 18 which means you have taken great care of him!"
cats,fc5us9v,t3_egbld0,1577466362.0,I think we can all agree moving sucks! Hugs to him!
cats,fbwk8p3,t3_eekuv2,1577152133.0,He was a ruggedly handsome bastard! Sorry he was having a hard time. You took great care of him or he wouldn't have lived to see 19. I have a 21 year old girl and I know her time is coming soon. I hope she gets to hang out with this lovable pirate kitty when she crosses over! My condolences on your loss.
