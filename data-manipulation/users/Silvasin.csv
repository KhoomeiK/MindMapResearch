Some folks like that sort of thing though, but imo you gotta be aware of the strength & layers of the smell before introducing it in such intimate acts; as well as being concerned for the other person involved in them & all their reactions to the situation. A petting zoo outing & reassessment of desires would be a good barometer of this quirk in your partner; I would certainly recommend it before tossing money into a stink-rag & hoping everything goes all sexy..

The bottom of the blade caps that grip into the machine to spin the blades were too soft & wore down like erasers in a matter of months, & the gaskets were such a pain to get out & clean... That was years back though, perhaps they've improved. 

I've found that the blade cap for my 7 year old Oster fits on Mason style jars with a similar sized opening; I tend to use glass jars that once held honey or Bulgarian yogurt, can't say for sure about blending hot liquids in them however. It's nice to have the option of a small container, or the giant glass jug it came with.

I've had decent experience with Hamilton Beach hand mixers, they're pretty good for their price; perhaps the same can be said of their blenders.
