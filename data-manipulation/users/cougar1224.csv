Queen Chestnut Farm in Tunnel Hill, GA is $3500. They have donkeys if that’s your thing. Outdoor ceremony area with indoor reception. 

Ringgold Depot in Ringgold, GA is $725 on weekends, $150 weekdays. Super cheap! No real place to get ready though. 

Lee and Gordon Mill Chickamauga, GA is $3900. 
The Mill is cool. Can do indoor or outdoor ceremony. Building next door for reception is kinda plain. 

Five Dollar Farm in Rock Springs, GA is $2000. Outdoor ceremony area with nice indoor reception. 

The Barn at Ross Farms in Cohutta, GA is $55 a head including catering from a selection of 3 menus. (She has tons of decor she will let you use for free also). Discounts on Sunday I believe. 
Nice bridal area to get ready. 

Flat Duck Farm Ringgold, GA is $2500. Super rustic. 

Hidden Hollow Resort in Chickamauga, GA is $2900. Kind of a drive but the area is nice. Also has cabins for rent but they are dated."

Looks like you got the one corner past the fireplace with 2 outlets. As much as I hate corner TV set ups, that looks like your best bet."
HomeDecorating,ff280n2,t3_er8awo,1579496476.0,Looks great.
Frugal,fetagqd,t3_eqjgke,1579373326.0,Adidas shorts are $35? Geez.
Weddingsunder10k,fet8rxf,t3_eqi9ge,1579372840.0,"Not having a bridal party. Nobody in their late 20s early 30s wants to be a bridesmaid anyways. I can barely get myself and my future husband coordinated. I wouldn’t even try to wrangle anyone else in either. 

I think I’ll hand off my bouquet to my dad after he walks me down the aisle."
WalgreensStores,feji7g2,t3_epdp2d,1579175375.0,"I follow that group too. They know our policies better than we do. If I wanna know what’s on sale and how to get a good deal, I check them out."
WalgreensStores,fegvxad,t3_enz5o4,1579103730.0,I surprised corporate hasn’t come up with some pole signage for us yet.
pics,fefmabm,t3_eotzz6,1579059387.0,He’s definitely a keeper. Good catch OP.
WalgreensStores,feffq83,t3_eosc4g,1579055372.0,This just reminds me we forgot to put the blue strips in today.
