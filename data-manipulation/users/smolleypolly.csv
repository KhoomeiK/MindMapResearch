From New York and San Diego to Tennessee and Maine. People usually give breast feeding mothers dirty looks when they breast feed in public. My mother had my sister in Germany and she said it was a common topic among mothers there that they do not breast feed around Americans, Americans are uncomfortable with breast feeding because we hypersexualize breasts."

HomeImprovement,fcxaveh,t3_ejed1x,1578057735.0,"I recommend always getting ceiling fans with lights, especially if it is a large room or has high ceilings. The can make all the difference in how light and airy it feels in a room to have an overhead light and if you don’t want them on after all you can just click them off and just use the fan."

lifehacks,fcvpppg,t3_ej2of9,1578007308.0,"Cool story. Nose blindness actually runs in my family! My paternal grandma was nose blind except for the smell of diesel fuel so she enjoyed road trips because it’s the only thing she could smell. My maternal grandfather was nose blind to everything except the smell of printer ink and he HATED that smell so much that he actually used fans in his office when he did paperwork so it would blow the smell away from him. My mom and brother are both nose blind too. My brother is only able to smell peppermint if he is eating it and because of this he is actually addicted to peppermint candies and I can smell him across the house he’s constantly minty. My mom can only smell oranges. She doesn’t even LIKE oranges but she likes the smell so when she has a bad day she will boil oranges on the stove and her whole house smells like a Florida orange juice bottle. I find it pretty cool how each person has one (1) specific thing they can smell and it’s usually a very robust smell. However, peppermint and orange Juice smell as bad together as they taste so uh, getting those two in a room on one of their binges is enough to gag."

Ghosts,fcng6yr,t3_ehts7i,1577811050.0,"My childhood home was extremely active but I never really noticed it wasn’t normal until I was 7 years old and I remember climbing up the ladder to the top of my bunk bed and a distinctly remember feeling fingers run through my hair (which was very long) and a hand grip my hair near my scalp very hard and rip me off the ladder. I twisted when I fell and slammed against the book shelf behind me. My mom heard me fall and scream and she came in and she asked me what happened and I told her but she didn’t believe me until she had her own experience. That house was filled with violent entities. We often saw black mists going through rooms or heard foot steps walking across the tile in the kitchen. You would hear it while standing in the kitchen in the middle of the day. Full heavy footsteps. Almost everyone who visited that house would tell me they had an experience even though I never told anyone my house was haunted. I still have nightmares of that house. The house wasn’t even very old, it was built in 1960 but it must have been cursed or something."
