todayilearned,ff6nagd,t3_eruymq,1579630836.0,"Godwin's law asserts that if an online discussion (regardless of topic) goes on for long enough, someone will inevitably compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds, at which point the discussion often ends.

Also, the [l](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Law_of_conservation_of_energy)aw of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

This means that a discussion, made up of mental energies, can also neither be created nor destroyed.  However, Godwin's law states that discussion can often be destroyed into nothingness by mentions of Hitler. As such, Godwin's law and the law of conservation of energy is in direct contradiction.

GetMotivated,ff5z76d,t1_ff5suqy,1579614920.0,"You see, the original proposition given by the guy above you is that having an egotistical mind could/might help people (he used mike Tyson as an example) perform better. You go on about how 99% (not sure where you got this number from, but it’s ok, you simply meant majority I assume)  of the people aren’t mike tyson, disregarding the original proposition that having a sort of egotistical mindset could be a kind of motivator for anyone in general to perform better, totally missing out the main point. that’s before going on to brand those who think themselves better than others as “losers” without much substantiation on this point. You go on to claim these people are losers “by their own definition” which is extremely confusing because we don’t know whose “definition” you are using.  

&#x200B;

the last I know, the word “loser” carries an extremely negative connotation, at least on the net.    


you said it is more important to have a healthy ego, we can all agree on that point since it is a generally correct statement. But would one with a healthy ego brand a large group of people who think themselves better than the others (sometimes they are not wrong too) as “losers”?    


this of course, leads me to give out a friendly precaution of how easy it is to fall into the trap of having the ego of no ego or the ego of having less ego or the ego of having healthier ego, it doesn’t matter, since it is not the main point here.
