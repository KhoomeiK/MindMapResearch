videos,ffnp3dm,t1_ffmxfx0,1580068811.0,"Please sir kind madam, tell me what is the ethical alternative to using electronics, like mobile phones. Children are being held in camps, mining minerals for these devices. They are deep down in dark tunnels, away from their mother and father.  
How do I save them, and still be able to play candy crush? 

Also what about clothes, is there an ethical alternative. Looking for clothes that are not made by people that have to use most of their low salary on food, not able to afford video games. People who works 25 years sewing the same parts on a blouse. That have working hours that would bring western girls to tears.   
Can I save them, by walking naked?

Please sir kind madam, as an embodiment of morality tell me. So I can stop the fucking unnecessary suffering and fucking death of HUMAN fucking beings."

Seem like you are projecting a lot on the boyfriend. Do you experience rejections in your relationship? (Ask this to yourself.)

The others are doing the same to the girlfriend."
