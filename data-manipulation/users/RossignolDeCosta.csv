AmItheAsshole,ffr1azo,t3_euriiu,1580148275.0,"ESH. I’m the same way about food. I don’t subscribe to the “we should all share’ philosophy others may have. They should be asking if they want to use yours. But, you should then also be asking to use theirs, and if you aren’t then you need to start. Also if it’s that big a deal to you, try not being so passive aggressive about it. 

How about: “Hey, I know that in the past it’s seemed like it hasn’t been a big deal that we use each others food, but it really bothers me. Can we start asking one another before we do it? I know that I haven’t asked either, so I want to make it equal all the way around.”

I have GERD/acid reflux. I have for a while. Initially it wasn’t painful, but because your esophagus is contracting due to the acid reflux, it felt like something was happening with my heart, because those muscles are in the same area. Check your pulse when you feel your chest pain. Chances are it won’t change, and what you’re feeling doesn’t have anything to do with your heart. 

Try using over the counter acid reducers, like Mylanta, or Prilosec if you want to take a pill. It’s likely your symptoms will decrease. Also consider reducing intake of highly acidic food, like coffee, tomatoes, or citrus fruits or juices. 

If none of that helps, talk to your doctor again."

I think the things people see that annoy them are mostly a lack of parental intervention in teaching kids how to behave. Example: if a kid is running around a plane, causing havoc and yelling his head off and the parents intervene to control it, I’m understanding that kids are kids, even if it’s initially annoying or loud. Kids are sometimes annoying and loud. If the parents just sit there like dead fish or act like it’s the kids sovereign right to behave that way, that’s bad parenting."

I don’t understand how you can have a more meaningful relationship than a FWB situation without it being meaningful. I think by ‘meaningful’ or ‘serious’ they are simply trying to say ‘not permanent’ and using the wrong words.

books,fdlyybp,t1_fdlulm6,1578535838.0,"I think the most practical advice to you, since you’re using this for self improvement, would be that it’s not so much about time spent as it is getting value out of the information. At first, time will be important because you’re trying to pick up a habit, but after a while I think it will depend on what it takes for you to get the most out of what you’re reading, and that depends solely on you.

So I’ll give my best answer to that, which is that if you catch the habit and really enjoy it, eventually you’ll find that timing yourself won’t be the yardstick to measure how much is enough. What will be important is the information you’re taking in, and if you’re using it in your life, or you’ll be wondering what happens next in that really good story you’re reading and staying up until 1 AM just to finish, or a combination of both those things. 

A more practical answer might be that it might depend on what you’re reading, too. If it’s something on a more weighty subject, or you have to look up the meanings to words to grasp the point, it will need more time to have an impact versus reading about a subject you’re already familiar with."

Because of the movies, a lot of people start with either DC or Marvel. Most of those characters got their start 50 years ago, with some exceptions. So reading from the beginning might be next to impossible. I started by looking up Wikipedia entries and then reading the comic book series that interested me the most about the character I was reading about. 

You can also get really good recommendations if you have a local comic book store. Just go in and ask. Nerds like to talk about their favorites :)"
