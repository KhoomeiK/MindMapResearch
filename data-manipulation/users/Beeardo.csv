2b2t,ffjx8l7,t3_eu04kp,1580009452.0,this looks lazy as shit
formula1,ffjrf1q,t1_ffjozgt,1580004961.0,Nah there is definitely a ton of people who don't realize how skilled they are/the skill it requires. I know I didn't and quite a few people I've talked to scoff at me if I tell them NASCAR drivers are highly skilled
todayilearned,ffjixwo,t1_ffj8mjq,1579999265.0,"I'd say reddit is worse for it honestly. On 4chan you can go to /pol/ but not everyone will agree on topics and very often legit debates will happen and there isn't any votes to sway anybody, its opinion vs opinion and thats it. Meanwhile on reddit you can go into a very specific subreddit and everything you say will be agreed with, votes will sway opinion and people can just ban those they don't agree with, /r/Sino comes to mind pretty heavily. When people say reddit is an echochamber I feel like thats almost a light way of putting it, reddit can straight up brainwash people if they aren't careful enough. 4chan can do this too, but you will see differing opinions and it might spark some critical thinking. To be fair I haven't been on 4chan in probably 4 years now so it could be drastically different to what I remember."
formula1,ffiqssx,t1_ffik33d,1579980398.0,"I never really realized how different and demanding stock car racing is until I did it in simracing, I respect the drivers 20x more now. It's insane to be going 200mph and being potentially 4 or 5 wide for extended periods of time practically millimeters away from each other, takes a very certain type of skill and it really isn't as easy as just turning left like a lot of people would have you think."
formula1,ffgxm2o,t1_ffgx459,1579917671.0,Anyone who argues about memes is probably pretty immature

formula1,ffgttnk,t1_ffglwbn,1579914892.0,You are 31 years old and arguing about memes. Are you sure you don't have those 2 numbers in the wrong spots?

pics,ffewple,t1_ffekrm0,1579868637.0,"Yes, he did! Not only that but he has over 700,000 people working under him, over 5 million benefiting from selling their products on amazon, and everyone else in the world also benefits from AWS, yknow, the thing like over half the internet runs on? Not to mention ordering from amazon itself... We would sure be living in a less convenient world without Bezos bringing all this to us at the time that he did. I know where I work for does nothing but benefit from selling our products on amazon and our customers do nothing but benefit from buying on it.

Oh wait, I forgot I was supposed to say hes the boogeyman and going to ruin the world... Oops"

AskReddit,ffaq5sn,t1_ffand1m,1579741892.0,"Its because they aren't paid with commission, no need to hover and try and oversell when there is no benefit to them. Back when future shop existed in Canada existed it was a very clear difference between the two, walk into FS and they would pretty much be trying to sell you anything the second the sliding doors opened, meanwhile at Best Buy you had to often seek someone out and ask for help. It's pretty much the only reason I go to best buy, any opinions are the employees and they will usually be straight to the point whether something is shit or not"
formula1,ff3g4np,t3_erdmok,1579540349.0,Was sorta wondering how long he would stick around
worldnews,ff25i9u,t1_ff244ty,1579494375.0,Because they don't have that money nor the drive to get that money so they sit back and complain like its going to fix their situation.

trees,fepj3ww,t1_feph7if,1579321812.0,"Yeah its weird isnt it, I live in canada and occasionally a meme will pop up on here about it being illegal and I'm like, ""uhh not its not"" and then I realize its very much illegal in tons of places and im extremely lucky to get it legally. What shocks me the most is just how quickly I got used to it being legal though"
