fatlogic,ffinkmb,t1_ffi84au,1579978166.0,"When I first started, I spent one week eating normally and tracked everything. It was so eye opening. Also it made it easier for me to figure out where to cut things out. Number one - the “couple small candies” I had every afternoon around 4. One day they totaled up to 900 calories!!"
fatlogic,ffinc7d,t1_ffic2ys,1579978005.0,"Ugh. The struggle to find new jeans is real. I actually kept my weight semi under control for years because when my favorite brand discontinued, I bought 8 pair!"
FitForFun,ffim93q,t3_etrg6m,1579977253.0,"Yoga worked wonders for my flexibility but I will say, I would recommend doing it consistently for a month if you want to give it a shot. It took me that long to feel like I made any progress and I eventually fell in love with it! But it’s NOT fun at first!"
FitForFun,ffim1ma,t3_ettlto,1579977109.0,"Aimed for a 10 mile run this morning but when I got out there, I was NOT feeling it. Told myself I was going to push for 8. At 5 I let myself stop. Sometimes you just don’t have it. I was not about to make myself miserable. Did a full half hour stretching session, then hit the steam room and now I’m headed to my sister’s place where we plan on binge watching The Morning Show for the next 10 hours!"
FitForFun,ffh7qoq,t1_fff4d2w,1579925498.0,Cross country skiing is SO HARD!! Good for you!!
FitForFun,ffh7oh0,t3_etavwf,1579925446.0,Hit my 6 mile run goal and my dance class! The only bad news is the trampoline party that I was super excited about was cancelled cause my friend’s kid got sick! Noooo! I have a big race coming up so I really should do a long run. Going to try for 10 tomorrow but I’ll be happy if I can get my butt out of bed and accomplish anything.
fatlogic,ffh78z1,t1_ffffefs,1579925080.0,"I love dessert but I get irrationally mad at the trend of putting like a whole cupcake in a milkshake. No! If you can’t fit it through a straw, it’s not allowed in a milkshake."
AskReddit,ffazb32,t1_ff9qc1c,1579747970.0,Haha. Same! “The way you feel about the girl across the street is not a ‘best friend’ thing.”
fatlogic,ffaf5or,t1_ff7ajnb,1579734279.0,"I have been doing what I’ve discovered is called zigzag dieting. If I’m starving, I’ll go over my calories. I find the next day I’m usually not that hungry. I just look at my calories for the week and work them out that way!"
FitForFun,ff3ogu9,t1_ff0fhx6,1579545430.0,Ugh - trying to workout again post being sick is the worst. I always feel like Bambi standing up for the first time! Definitely ease back in!
FitForFun,ff271xv,t3_er0jth,1579495659.0,"My goal this week is to get in 6 miles of running, one session of my super fun dance class and then I have a hockey game on Sunday. Also my friends daughter is turning 2 this weekend and the party is at a trampoline place so I plan on acting like all the kids! I’ve been dying to go to one of those places so I’m so excited!!"
FitForFun,ff26m2a,t3_ep2q82,1579495283.0,"Hi! Love the idea of this sub. I’m hocknat and shockingly - my sport is ice hockey! It’s old lady fun hockey but we’ve actually gotten some good players in the last few years so I’m trying to up my fitness to be more helpful to my team. One of my goals is to get more into weightlifting. And I’ve been trying to do more running races to improve my cardio. 
Oh and has anyone tried 305 fitness? It is my OBSESSION!! Ridiculously fun dance classes. There’s a ton of twerking and posing and general goofing around. It’s the one group class I take that I absolutely love."
fatlogic,ff22vyl,t1_ff1xous,1579492323.0,There week minded.
fatlogic,fezc7ed,t1_feomkf6,1579455862.0,How do alcohol calories not count??  The one thing I will say is we had a full open bar at our wedding and I had about half a glass of wine. You’re so jacked that eating and drinking is the last thing on your mind!
fatlogic,fdkyzo9,t1_fdkykd6,1578514069.0,"I was right at a BMI of 29/30 when I ran. My wife was closer to 34/35 for her most recent one but yeah, we can both fit into plane seats!"
fatlogic,fdky90t,t1_fdkxey0,1578513628.0,"My wife is the classic D1 athlete who ate 4000 calories everyday but worked out 9 hours a day which lead to weight gain post college. But she’s still a natural athlete and works out with a triathlon team every morning for 2 hours. She’s always tried to outrun her diet. This year I’m trying to show her the joys of calorie counting! 
I am NOT an athlete. I just trained a ton. I actually lost enough weight that I think I was technically just dipping into overweight when I actually ran but it was NOT easy. I don’t think I would ever do it again. Half marathons are much more my speed."
fatlogic,fdkx23u,t1_fdkh61d,1578512930.0,"To be fair both my wife and I ran a marathon while obese. But also to be fair, we definitely didn’t win! And we’re working to lose weight. My wife also just qualified for the aquabike world championships and she raced age group, not Athena."
fatlogic,fdkwdnr,t1_fdknoan,1578512530.0,I did this for my honeymoon. I found it helpful to eat all the fish tacos and sushi with my constant stream of pina coladas. Also don’t be afraid to mix it up with some mudslides. Hits that all important whip cream food group!  Have fun!!!
fatlogic,fdibcb9,t1_fdi9lha,1578439137.0,I was just curious cause that would freak me out!
fatlogic,fdi5p6e,t1_fdez5ec,1578436193.0,I lost weight cause my weakness is carbs and sweets but...my cholesterol went through the roof!
fatlogic,fdi06tu,t1_fdh4724,1578433375.0,I didn’t realize I had it until I gained 30lbs. Taking back off the weight got rid of all my symptoms!
fatlogic,fdhvmz2,t1_fdh4hzz,1578430964.0,Yeah I don’t want to freak you out but I found the picture very easily. You definitely have a right to ask her to take it down. Lie if you have to save face - “a coworker was searching body positivity on Instagram and warned me that she came across it” or something. I’ll pretend to be your coworker! Ha! That is not cool.
fatlogic,fdcmcid,t1_fdcl0gq,1578278480.0,Woman here - I want to look good for my wife!
fatlogic,fczuaiu,t1_fcxxlo0,1578108730.0,"I ran a marathon- took a week off and the next Tuesday when I tried to do a shakeout run, I had to walk after a half mile because the pain was so intense. If that sounds like you, congratulations...you have hip bursitis. The good news is rest made mine go away after a month."
