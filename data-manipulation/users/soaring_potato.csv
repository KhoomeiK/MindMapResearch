Meanwhile. My first (and so far only) biology exam in college (cellular biology) was 60 questions, 80 marks. And 3 of those was where you had to type. One for 10 marks (it was just hitting off steps) all multiple choice were for one. Except like 3, there i had to drag it.

Last time i drank 4 drinks (one was a special beer. So more alcohol). Thus putting me well over the 0.1 blood alcohol level.(I am 60 kg) I was tipsy.  Not drunk. Tipsy. Only thing of that list was i lost volume control, which i alsl get when happy or tired. I definetly wouldn't drive then. But my speech was fine and my balance, vision and hearing normal.

Note taking is actually proven to be less effective if you copy it word for word, rather than using your own system.
Ask her how her tests in uni were. Because 90% chance the bio tests were multiple choice. At least big portions of em. And no way you ever have to write a specific paragraph.
You should file an official complaint within the school against her. And have another teacher recheck it."

So they don't. Because when the algea dies. That gets released back quite fast.. now given. Trees do this too. But it's much much slower. 
You'd literally have to pollute the oceans A LOT.  to get more algea capturing carbon. Which then you'd just want euthrophication. Which is bad. 
You'd have to do this because algea concentrations everywhere are already as they should be. Since they grow so fast"

They get eaten by whales. Whale dies and sinks to the depths of the ocean. Where it stays and rots. Eventually buried and all. Possibly eventually becoming oil in like a few thousand years. 

Trees are great. But algea are delicious too. And actually pretty healthy (seaweed). And the many different types of algea can be used for so much. Microbiology wouldn't be the same without em. Because of agarplates. They are used in cleaning up wastewater. They are more complex and useful than you think off.

teenagers,ff79jo2,t1_ff5ylny,1579643901.0,"That's likely because of the nitrate and phosphate concentrations becoming too high. Surrounded by farmland perhaps? Or geese shit.

teenagers,ff78x0t,t1_ff6pc99,1579643448.0,"Evolution literally isn't linear. Hell you could argue that we are BEHIND of our ancestors. Because we took out so much pressures. 

Our eyesight is a lot worse. A hell lot of people require surgery because our jaws are shrinking and the teeth won't fit,  a lot of people don't even get wisdom teeth anymore. Many more people getting celiac, lactose intolerance, allergies. Also genetic dissorders that could be detrimental. Those people sometimes live long enough now to reproduce. Technically weakening the gene pool.

Evolution isn't to get what is ""best"" just ""good enough."" Like we can't swallow and breathe at the same time. Babies can. Would be nice if we could too. But not doing that didn't kill us so it happened to go out.

Algea are wonderfull. Evolution doesn't go for better. You are sounding like one of those creationists that say we came from monkeys. And tries to ""disprove"" evolution by saying a monkey has never given birth to a human...

Evolution just means change. Algea are easily able to live. And they are good enough. They are more complex and diverse than you probably imagine. Yeah they aren't good for carbon storage. (Altho algea are eaten by whales. Which when die sink to the bottom and then that kind of stays there. Also trapping carbon) 
Like seaweed is an algea. They just are macroalgea and not microalgea. Being in the water they don't require a vascular system. That wouldn't be beneficial for them. Even detrimental since it requires a lot of energy to make that and it doesn't serve a purpose while underwater."

(And no I don't think an 18 year old SHOULD especially like married and kids and such)

But aren't mature enough to consent in their healthy relationship to say be spanked, tied up etc. Even when no abuse at all is involved. And the person on the receiving end (not always the girl), really wants it too. Nah they are too young and that's always abusive?!?! Nah. Not how it works."

Yeah I agree, an 18 year old will have trouble navigating the scene. Especially a woman. Since preyed upon within the scene. With this I mean fetlife, parties, dungeons etc. 

However. If they are both into it, they are able to navigate through it within a normal healthy relationship, where there is respect, communication etc. Which yes. 18 year olds can be mature enough to have that in a relationship with another 18 year old... 

Some people like being tied up or spanked, and then that being done, isn't abusive. It would be weird to say ""yeah we both find this hot, and wanna try it. But people say it's abusive and we're not old enough to do it. So let's not."" No. They will still do it, and when it's within a healthy relationship, that's fine."

WHEN would be the tipping point from it being ok in a LTR. And then to more actively seek out bdsm? 

Definetly not being in bdsm spaces and actively seeking it out.

What i am describing is completely different from the post. Only thing in common is it involves 18 year olds (altho not really since post is with a grandpa) and bdsm (or the post. Abuse masked as bdsm).

Probably helps that it seems like younger guys today are a bit more focused on the woman enjoying herself too.

Definetly shouldn't be having fulltime dynamics yet. (Altho don't understand how anyone does that..) But like little things should be ok.

Exploring that part of your sexuality, who you are. Most people that age have a pretty decent sense of self (for who they are in that moment. This obviosly can change later, it always can and does)

Then it isn't ""to spice it up."" Or ""reviving sex life.""

They should always be the same age tho. 

It's like. They know they have different things. And are curious as to how it what the other has looks like and feels to touch. Nothing more. 

One time my backdoor kid (one year younger than me) sent a picture of his ass, taken on i believe i pod touch, and showed it to other kids. He was like 8 or 9. Because he wanted to know how his own butt looked and like mooning the other boys by showing his i pod.
