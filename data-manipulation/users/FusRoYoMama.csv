ClashOfClans,ff8muz2,t1_ff8c8f4,1579686456.0,"I did a presentation on MTX a while back and used Clash as an example, the amount of money that I found being spent on it genuinely shocked the class, and I used a very low percentage of the player base so my findings were on the conservative side.

Then I blew their minds even more when I reminded them that this was just from ONE game. The amount of money being spent on things that have no real world value is insane.

I play Hill Climb Racing 2 as well and they came out with an animated flaming skull skill which is clearly a rip of of Ghost Rider and I just had to get it, it's the only purchase I've made on the game for £8.99 and nearly every race I take part in, at least one other player has that skin, or a variation of another paid skin.
Game developers know that people only see a few bucks as disposable and it is basically a printing press for money."

AskReddit,fejnxor,t1_fej6zht,1579181174.0,"The door latch on my dryer broke off and fell into the frame, I tried to fish it out but had no luck. Look up online repairs and parts and it would have cost £100+, fuck that, I could buy a cheap new dryer with that money, so I took a chance and took the frame apart, got the latch and popped it back into place. Has worked fine ever since."

God I hate this so much, I love to use hypnosis to catch pokemon but gotta make sure I have ether/elixer to replenish my PP.

It's especially noticeable during gym leader battles too. I guess they don't want to make it too easy but c'mon, it's in the game."
natureismetal,fd921al,t1_fd8fxtu,1578227130.0,"I remember seeing a short clip of an owls nest, there was 3 or 4 chicks in it, each bigger than the last. Anyway, without warning, the biggest one waltzes over to the smallest owl, opens its beak and just slams down on the newest additions head, half of the chick was already swallowed while the other half was wriggling frantically. It was over in a few seconds and I was horrified.

Have never been able to find that clip and since then I'm not a bird person at all. They too savage."

My dad has never made a bottle, never dressed a kid let alone change a nappy that has shit leaking out of it. I kind of envy him but at the same time he'll never have with me and my brother what I have with my kids. To me, he's just the man who took us places sometimes and shouted at us when we were bad, for my girls, I'll always be their dad."
