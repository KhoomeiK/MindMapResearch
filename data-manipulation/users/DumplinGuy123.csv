TrueOffMyChest,ffbhabp,t3_esfc7z,1579765255.0,The best advice i can give rn is to not gauge your life by how it is now bc once you’re out of the house at 18-21 your life will change and hopefully for the better (I pray it does). I can’t tell you how freeing it is to be out of the house. Happy late birthday my dude and I hope you keep your head up :)

libertarianmeme,ff8zslf,t1_ff8yrpm,1579701163.0,I was wondering the same thing
facepalm,ff76n9b,t1_ff75ery,1579642162.0,"I didn’t ignore anything in your statement. I simply said that he didn’t inherit all of it. Your statement made it seem like he only inherited his money. Also, who are you to tell me what the ‘correct course’ of action would be? I didn’t choose a narrative, what I stated was a fact. The majority of his wealth didn’t come from inheritance. Also, my issue wasn’t with the quantity of money he has, my issue was with your statement misleading and giving off the notion that he only inherited his money. Furthermore, I never said 4.8 I said 4.5 which was his net worth before he took office. He spent 1 billion in his campaign and is not taking a salary so he is losing money being president which is why his net worth now is 3.1 billion. Idk where you’re getting your numbers from. Mine are coming from Forbes"
facepalm,ff72uea,t1_ff71w3e,1579640008.0,"So it is my fault that you were vague and left it up to the reader to interpret your writings? That's like the first thing you learn in freshman english class. Unless you want to be vague and mysterious, you always make your statements to where the reader has all the information to not have to wonder what you're talking about. It's not my reading comprehension that is at fault, it is your incompetence at writing that is to blame. I suggest that you write more often."
unpopularopinion,ff71nf4,t1_ff6vs8f,1579639342.0,"Okay, I can understand that. The position I'm coming from though is how the Jews viewed themselves and the pharisees. The pharisees were viewed as the top of the political ladder. They were treated by Rome as if they were an independent city-state and were free to live and rule themselves. They obviously had a Roman governor residing over them, Pilate, but other than that, Rome had very little to do with the Jews. They just kind of let them do what they wanted as long as they weren't disrupting anything on a major level."
facepalm,ff718uo,t1_ff6wmi1,1579639108.0,"I didn’t put words into your mouth, I directly quoted your statement. Also when it is a direct quote, it’s not a misquote. If anything it is a misinterpretation. In that case, you need to elaborate more in your statements as to not confuse anyone"
facepalm,ff710o5,t1_ff6wmi1,1579638975.0,"The ‘small loan of a million dollars’ (as he puts it) along with the inheritance he got from his father, are small compared to the amount of money he made from his own business ventures and deals. Saying his wealth comes from inheritance is asinine; which is basically what you’re saying."

unpopularopinion,ff6umn7,t1_ff6sxlj,1579635217.0,"If you look at the Jewish power structure, it was very corrupt and needed to be changed. Saying that Jesus didn't disrupt power structures is a lie is ignorant in and of itself. He's obviously not going around saying that Rome needs to be taken down and all that because it took away from the message he was trying to convey which was to not be so legalistic in your faith as to be blind of God's power. The Jews at the time of Jesus had so many laws that they \*had\* to follow otherwise they were kicked out of the synagogue. Jesus went in and disrupted how they were running things and my favorite passage is when he saw that they were turning the synagogue into profit he went in and flipped the tables of money and yelled at them to get out and stop making a mockery of the Lord's house. No he wasn't anti-establishment but he was anti-legalism. The Jews turned the religion into something it wasn't supposed to be and changed it. Sorry if I repeated something, btw."

unpopularopinion,ff6s5mw,t3_eru0ba,1579633755.0,"To fix the child problem (not how it sounds), education in sexual education is proven to be the most effective. Researchers have found that the more people (especially women) are educated, not only in sex ed but schooling in general, the less kids theyll have. The longer people are in school (high school, college, etc.) the more focused they are on school and are far less likely to have an excess amount of kids."

Seaofthieves,feksh3c,t3_epiaei,1579206667.0,A few people I think of when I think of SoT is Summit1G and Pace22. They're what got me into this game and I think it's the same for other people too. They're also the people that got me into actually pirating people instead of just doing quests to mix up the gameplay lol
pcgamingtechsupport,feks6wy,t3_epncwy,1579206503.0,I have this same problem when I'm playing Sea of Thieves. Ill go onto my second or third monitor for something and ill click back onto the game and itll be frozen. I have to minimize and bring up the game a few times for it to work. Also my computer has been crashing without input for a few months now. I just ordered a new PSU and ill update if it works. What PSU do you have?
Seaofthieves,fekrtuq,t1_fekq7py,1579206290.0,Agreed
Seaofthieves,fekpxy0,t3_epnlya,1579205180.0,So basically from what Im seeing is that she got straight pooped on live on stream and she didnt like being embarassed so she had them banned? I wish someone at Rare would see this and actually fix the situation. The game is too good to be doing stuff like this. This is almost on the level of Epic Games.....

iamverybadass,fe6zi8h,t1_fe6z72f,1578908134.0,When I worked at a mechanics shop we had to change them very quickly and people would drive up after using their car all day and we had no time to let it cool off. Some people would bring it in first thing in the morning so it would be fine but most people didn’t so I would usually have to change it while it was burning hot. I actually used that tool in the picture like 20 times a day or so and it was fantastic
