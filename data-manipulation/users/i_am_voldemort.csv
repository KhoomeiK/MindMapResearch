news,ffjae8x,t1_ffiajwj,1579994167.0,"Others have said it, but I'll put my thoughts down... it's a combination of one or more of the following:

\- Unfortunately lots of kids come from shitty families that don't model healthy relationships in the first place.  So you get a doomed cycle that repeats over and over.

\- Lots of these kids who are getting married are young 18-21 years old, first tour in the military.  Young, dumb, and hormones.  How many college students do you hear getting married?  Same age cohort, but it is incredibly uncommon in college students.  I think about how I fucked around and was immature in college at that age.  If I was married in college and done what I did my spouse would have definitely divorced me.  You're still growing up and maturing at that age...

I knew one person who got married at 19 years old... but then after about six months realized it was a fucking train wreck and a huge mistake... but had no idea how to actually get divorced; it is incredibly harder to get divorced than it is to get married.  She actually had to call her parents and break the news first that she was married (didn't tell anyone) to ask for help on getting divorced.  

\- The military has perverse incentives to get married.  You can move out of barracks and you get more money in BAH.  Your spouse can move with you on PCS.  If you are dual military it makes sure you PCS to the same location.  I know one person who married their BF just to avoid a shitty PCS and is now regretting it and trying to ""make it work""...

\- Financial issues.  This stems from some of the above... a lot of these kids are coming in to money that seems huge to them based off where they came from.  Racking up stupid expenses, blowing money on stupid stuff.  They end up in debt and it takes a toll on the relationship.

\- Moves, deployments, substance abuse (alcohol), loneliness, and temptation takes it toll."
