unpopularopinion,ffgkore,t3_eth62e,1579908449.0,"My parents are religious and they don't ""brainwash"" me. They believe God exists and so do I but they don't go to church. And they aren't forcing upon religion. And the difference between a religion and a cult is that a cult you are actually brainwashed to believeing in the cult whereas in a religion you have a choice. Of course depends on how religious your parents are."
