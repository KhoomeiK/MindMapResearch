Assistance,fe9zl8f,t1_fe9vnhl,1578942866.0,"Thank you ! Our daughter is 11, and I thought as long as we're calm about the situation she will be too. So far so good. Our town doesn't have shelters and the closest one is not safe. We've tried many places for advise, or places they recommend but it just seems like I'm chasing my tail.

We've asked family, everything was set in advance so we could move in temporarily and they changed their mind yesterday. Now we're scrambling to find something/anything."

ChildSupport,fdfeaba,t1_fde33h1,1578359667.0,"The problem is your punishing the child for the parents actions. The child suffers because of their parents - the one who wants divorce, and the one who doesn't want to pay child support for their child because of the divorce."
ChildSupport,fde2dma,t1_fde16h8,1578329630.0,"And I'm the one that sounds bitter ? Lol  If you don't want to be a parent take birth control into your own hands. Yes women lie but so do men and accidents happen - condom broke, etc

And I'll admit some fathers do get totally fucked in court over child support."
ChildSupport,fdcwb74,t3_ekomjc,1578286186.0,"Men cause 100% of the pregnancies. Either use a condom, get snipped or up your pull out game if you don't want to be a father.

Deadbeats are parents that don't pay child support. That's all the courts care about and they're not forced to see the child unless they request visitation."
ChildSupport,fd5ave4,t3_ek2lff,1578175844.0,He hasn't been in the child's life up to this point and now wants custody ? He might get visitation but he will still be ordered to pay child support.

Make sure he has 0 access to your account, debt card number/pin number etc.

Good luck !"

JustNoSO,fci7ebb,t1_fcfr3vq,1577658625.0,"Yeah he's quiting his job to try and dodge child support. I can guarantee if he quits he will not be a SAHD, he'll still expect the baby to go to daycare.
So instead of 1 child you have 2 to feed, clean up after etc.
He needs to go, I'm sure he can go crawling back to his wife as long as he's still employed.
You could always tell him your pregnant - with twins ! And see how fast he bails.

Good luck hon :)"
