IAmA,ffs2jsh,t1_ffq3aec,1580171559.0,Interesting. Glad it's not too bad. Thanks for answering!
IAmA,ffpzias,t3_eukqya,1580112354.0,Is the make up as annoyingly uncomfortable as it looks? How well can you breathe with it on your mouth and nose like that?
NoStupidQuestions,ffi8227,t3_eti97g,1579967509.0,"I assume I do. Most people have a distinct smell. Everytime I'm with my boyfriend, my clothes will smell like him after he's gone. It's not a bad smell or anything, it just smells like *him*."

sadcringe,ff9vbjo,t1_ff9t1j3,1579722277.0,"I was clearly talking about love, so my use of ""feelings"" should be taken as love."
sadcringe,ff9glcn,t1_ff9gaom,1579712571.0,They can. Doesn't mean you don't have feelings for the person you do know.
sadcringe,ff9ghwz,t1_ff9g6bw,1579712512.0,"In my case. But I can imagine it would have been painful if he started dating someone else while we were still friends. At that point, I'm not going to make a move on someone who's taken."
sadcringe,ff9eri5,t1_ff9dp8y,1579711447.0,"They could be really good friends with the person and know them really well. I mean, I started to fall in love with my boyfriend before we officially dated, because we were sorta just friends at first and got to know each other. 

Just because they're not dating the person doesn't mean they don't know them enough to love them."
WTF,ff8b49l,t1_ff8ayl5,1579671510.0,"Couldn't remember what it was called, so just went with roof. Thanks for reminding me!"
WTF,ff83sly,t3_es0ate,1579665229.0,"Cut the trees so they don't mess up the powerlines, realized they took away the shade though, put on a roof. Now it's also a way to get out of the rain."
NoStupidQuestions,ff83mfq,t3_es4khz,1579665098.0,"I usually remember every single name in a movie, but not with the new The Grudge. I honestly do not remember any name from that movie at all."

NoStupidQuestions,ff1qxri,t3_er1vm8,1579484224.0,"Yes. I don't answer calls from unknown numbers because 99.9% it is a spam caller and usually if I answer, the amount of spam calls I get reaches an absurd level. I used to get so many spam calls that it pissed me off. I once got 21 calls from the same number in a six-hour period. I was pretty annoyed and I answered a few just to see what the hell was up. Things got a little worse for a while. 

So now I don't ever answer them. If it is someone important, they will leave a message."

college,fecxufq,t3_eoi3n5,1578989033.0,Is there any other open class you can take? Maybe something else required for your degree that you can just replace the class with?
college,fecxo13,t3_eoi7qg,1578988812.0,"I can definitely understand that. Does your school have a student government? I felt out of place and like I was missing out, but then I joined my student government and met some really cool people. We help plan events and even go on trips. 

Even without student government, you can look into the clubs that your school has. Joining a group of people can help you meet new friends."
college,fecnwek,t3_eog34s,1578978664.0,"It could be a force of habit and he doesn't really realize he's doing it. If you mention it to him, do so in a calm manner and just ask why he's doing it/if he realizes he's doing it."
college,fecgnsd,t3_eoffgq,1578973468.0,"A very interesting class I took was Descriptive Astronomy. I really love space and I enjoy looking at planets and stars, so learning more about the planets and stars that I look at (and the ones I can't see) was really awesome.

Most useful so far, for my degree, was Financial Accounting. It was tough and confusing at times, but I enjoyed it for the most part and I am going to be majoring in accounting when I transfer. It taught me a lot about the main basis of accounting."

tipofmytongue,fdpv3ge,t3_emnp6j,1578641711.0,It wasn't professional or anything. Kinda shaky home camera stuff.

NoStupidQuestions,fcvj9z9,t1_fcuktpu,1578003281.0,I was home-schooled and never had a nightmare related to school ... until I entered college. Now I'll occasionally get the nightmare where I can't find my class and I'm late.
