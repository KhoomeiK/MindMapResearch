worldnews,fcwr57y,t1_fcwqd1r,1578034330.0,"Yeah, it’s more or less what you said. Hypersonic missiles will be able to vary their speed and trajectory after launch, making them virtually impossible to intercept because by the time you figure out where it’s going and how fast its moving it could be going somewhere else and even faster. They won’t be unbeatable forever, I’m sure once they’re developed everyone will start working on ways to counter them, but for now they’re the next goal. Hypersonic missiles will stay in the upper atmosphere instead of going to space too, which also makes them harder to intercept because you need similar technology to get something going that fast that quickly, most ballistic missiles don’t hit hypersonic speeds until they’re in space. 

ICBMs go a lot further and higher up into space, which gives them more time to be intercepted. ICBMs can be intercepted during the “glide phase”. At this point they’re not accelerating so their trajectory is fixed and they’re in space so it’s possible to get an intercept missile up to similar speeds using conventional rocket technology. That said, intercepting ICBMs is also an incredibly difficult task. It took years of development to design, it’s not clear how reliable the tech even is, and few countries have the capability to do it."
worldnews,fcwo514,t1_fcwn5ax,1578031306.0,"Hypersonic is really really fast. Normally to be called hypersonic something needs to be going 5 times the speed of sound, roughly 3100 miles per hour. Normal missiles go about 550 miles per hour. The fastest ones right now go about 2,000 miles per hour*.

A hypersonic missile is one that goes so fast it couldn’t be shot down, so it would essentially be guaranteed to reach its target. Russia and the US (and probably China) are developing them. It’s the next big thing in missile technology because they are functionally unstoppable. 

The missile used in the drone strike today wasn’t hypersonic, it was a normal missile. The NYT article is almost definitely a coincidence.

*ICBMs go much much faster than this, but since they go on suborbital trajectories and spend very little time in the atmosphere, and since the vast majority of missiles never see speeds comparable to an ICBM, I’d argue they don’t fall into the “normal missile” category"
