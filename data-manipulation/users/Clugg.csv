Nah, fuck them. It's obvious that they're after our money rather than valuing us as consumers of their *shitty* product. My evidence to support this is the near constant influx of new dumb looking Elite sets that can only be purchased with Boins; while having a dripfeed of content that is meaningful and useful to us.

Compound all of that with the fact that they made a significant change to the way the game plays and then *immediately* went radio silent while on vacation, and it's obvious that they don't give a fuck about the players."
