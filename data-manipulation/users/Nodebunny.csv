Then it's like they wanted to confuse you about which of the 10 girls Geralt is supposed to be destined to meet; and is there some kind of princess thing going on here, or not? Like every other episode they're introducing more princesses than Adventure Time... and now theyre not. Now its sorcerers everywhere, sorcerers all the things!
