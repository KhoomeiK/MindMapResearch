That has stuck with me when trying to cope with my own mental health issues. 
I'm glad you were able to break away from those feelings, but if they resurface again, please talk to someone, even if it's a friend or stranger on the internet. 
You matter."
socialskills,fdnb034,t3_em8ef3,1578581873.0,"I used to care a LOT about what people thought of me and would dwell on negative things people said to me endlessly. It was awful. 
I'm 32 now, and I don't know when it happened, but now I just don't fucking care what people think about me. I would try to emulate not caring when younger, but I was never successful. It's very liberating to just not give a fuck. That's not to say I treat people awfully. I try to treat people as I'd like to be treated but if they don't like my clothes, weight, hobbies, etc? Fuck it. I'm trying to find happiness in a world that feels like it's literally burning. Yanno, like poor fucking Australia."

insanepeoplefacebook,fcqiubi,t1_fcqfkz2,1577886774.0,"Does he have to do something personally to one individual for that person to hate what he stands for? I've not personally met him, but how he treats other people is reason enough for me to know that he isn't a good person. I don't have a child locked away in the camps, but I still know that shit is heinous and wrong.
Though the advice of stepping away from the News and social media when it becomes too much is solid. But no, we shouldn't be complaisant to what is happening in the country just because Trump has never personally knocked on my door and harassed me."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcqhi40,t1_fcq9bjl,1577886081.0,"If only our President, Vice President, or other political leaders accepted the fact that others are different from them. Instead they're systematically undoing what little equality LGBTQ+ people have, Pence wants Gilead so he's trying to take away women's autonomy, and then there's the whole fact that our President couldn't fucking say Nazis are bad and instead incites racial violence. (Unfortunately I could go on and on, because that's the history of 2016-2019).
But no. You're right. Go on about accepting that others are different and then hoping to earn that same basic human decency of acceptance for something that can't be controlled, like race, gender, sex, sexuality, etc..."

rickandmorty,fcabrhm,t1_fc9xerd,1577566323.0,"I can see that. I suppose I saw it as a new reaction because I interpreted the break down before they go to the Spa to Detox, not one of horror, such as Rick's reaction to the cat's mind scan, so much as they're mentally and physically exhausted and are coming down from 6 days of non-stop, on-the-go, narrowly-escaping-death. Certainly, he's always been suicidal, but he still has multiple back up plans to prevent his... permanent (I guess for lack of a better word) death. So while he axed Operation Phoenix, there was still Hologram Rick from the nanobots or whatever in Morty's spine. 

And as much as I'm curious, I know the whole point of the cat was to show us that some things are better left unknown. Because NOT knowing what would fuck with Rick's head so badly, is way worse than knowing that, ah, geez, it's only pirates."
