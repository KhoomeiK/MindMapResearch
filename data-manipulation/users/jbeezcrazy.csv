coyote,ffdbxp0,t3_eszqdn,1579817604.0,I just called the village and they said they aren’t doing anything right now about the problem. They are protected animals. But that doesn’t mean that can’t at least try to help them. I’ll try. So heartguard works for mange?
coyote,ffd86l5,t3_eszqdn,1579815303.0,Thank you. I was afraid of that. There 2 others coyotes I’ve seen around here that look the same. I live in a northwest suburb of Chicago and maybe I’ll see one a year. So far I’ve see this guy everyday for the past month. He came close to my patio in daylight yesterday so I was able to get a picture. Going to call the village hall and see if they have recommendations.

She was able to get reduced utilities and help with her rent. It never hurts to ask. The worse they can say is “no”.

retailhell,ff7tr33,t3_es2uyk,1579658155.0,One year right before Christmas the registers went down mid transaction. The customer was buying supplies for a funeral. While we waited for register to reboot she went on to tell me the most horrible story involving one of her young students that died. To this day I am occasionally reminded of it and it makes me so sad. Please don’t try to unburden yourself to some random person. Don’t want to hear it!!!!

No remote start and no heated steering wheel, plus a bunch of other things. One of the reasons I bought my Renegade was because of the heated steering wheel.

All during the holidays the girls were bringing in lots of delicious looking and tasting baked goods. He said he would give it his best attempt to try and make something for us. He bought a ready made slab of rice crispy treats and decorated it by drizzling chocolate over it and adding sprinkles. You’d think it would look fine. Nope. Those poor rice crispy treats looked like someone tried to murder them. They tasted good but his decorating skills are non existent! I think if you never tried anything like that before it can be overwhelming and the screw up factor goes up to 10!

I would have accepted that.

My father called me to tell me he wasn’t feeling well. As we were talking he passed out and fell. I called 911. Got in my car and raced over to his house. Nobody was going to get in my way of getting there as fast as I could. I didn’t put myself or anyone else in danger but if someone was going slow in the passing lane you can be sure I would have been pissed off. I just hate it when people think they can police other drivers. Not your job. Just pull over and let the guy pass.

This is something that should have been addressed in the beginning of the relationship.  Dad needs to find out why his daughter doesn’t like the girlfriend and either fix it or get rid of the girlfriend. I’m sure the girlfriend is a very nice person but his loyalty should be to his daughter.

We decided to set her up with a Uber account and take her on some test runs. She’s ok with that.  We will always take her wherever she wants to go but wanted to give her some freedom.  Like if she wanted to go to a friends house for lunch. Today my mother said she wouldn’t need her car anymore so one of us should take it. So we decided who had the biggest need and gave it to my nephew. No fights. I’m so glad I have reasonable siblings. Can’t imagine fighting with them over money or material things.
