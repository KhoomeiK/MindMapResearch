Left : power to the people (workers)

Right: power to the “deserving” (well-connected)


This helps simplify it a lot.

So when you have someone like Mao, who claimed to “liberate” his people, but was only exalting himself and killing indiscriminately, you can see his “left” is a gross perversion. It is a marketing tactic to get people to support you. 

You see the same kind of tactic in North Korea. But after generations of “freedom” from the evil West, his people believe in *power to the deserving.* Jong Un is there because he is a descendant of God. What was sold as left, is blatantly right.

So “lefty” sounding things can be used by evil actors to uplift themselves and then oppress their own people. But this is perversion of *power to the people* it is clearly not actual power to the people."

politics,fe05tse,t1_fdzl02b,1578803786.0,"Thanks for the article.

The rationale has some merit.

Where it falls apart is when the reporters convey a message from the president, they present it as “official”

The problem here is: the sheer amount of false statements that are “official” is staggering. It undermines the role of journalism to convey false statements.

For example: Trump says he didn’t pressure Ukraine into starting an investigation into the Bidens.

And journalists printed this even after Trump and others confirmed that he did pressure Ukraine.

So, the journalists treated his statement as somehow equal to the truth, when it was just utter horseshit.

The journalists need to qualify every false statement as FALSE. 

Not— “White house denies these claims.” Nor simply printing what Trump says. These are not good enough.

For something to be “official” there has to be an understanding that proper research, vetting, investigation, and general intent to actively find the truth is in play. That is official.

Journalism has to catch up. Which means it needs to reveal truth. And truth eventually destroys the support systems that prop up evil men

If this kind of interaction kills your confidence, you won’t go far in life.

The proper response to a girl saying she is hungry, is “me too.” And then you say something funny and ask her to share something about herself. Then you share something too. If you are healthy and happy, you will have enough to share.

Then go grab a bite together, geez"

Reporting/Journalism:

Researched, peer-reviewed, and accountable to the public for corrections. Laws should be passed to create actual fact reporting again.

All journalism should be identified as such:

“This is a journalist piece, subject to all laws pertaining to facts, research and accountability.”

And all “opinion” including shit-for-brains smear tactics and racism should be identified:

“This is not a journalist piece, it is not subject to laws pertaining to facts, bias, research nor accountability.”

And people like Limbaugh and all the Fox puppets would have to read that out loud at set intervals during the broadcast.

Also, we should forget trying to salvage the word “News” that term is forever dead. It has no meaning anymore."

Meditation,fcmgind,t1_fcld3fp,1577774397.0,"The breath is a center. It is a peaceful resting position. The breath is home. 

It is something to witness. It is something to be aware of.

You can take note of its qualities, but you are not putting energy into changing it.

You are not adding or taking away.

It just **is**

With this in mind, if you find yourself taking a nice big breath when you start, or even a random one during your meditation, let it be. Not a big deal. Extra oxygen is good. 

Let the thought pass. Do not judge or attach extra meaning to the act of breathing. This includes even when you feel that you have controlled a breath or two."
