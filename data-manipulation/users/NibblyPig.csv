In both cases, in order to help others, men sacrificed their lives by exposing themselves to lethal levels of radiation in order to lessen the impact of the nuclear disasters. [They felt that they could sacrifice themselves to reduce the burden on other people.](https://www.businessinsider.com/chernobyl-volunteers-divers-nuclear-mission-2016-4?r=US&IR=T)

> They knew the basement was highly radioactive, but officials promised that if they died, their families would be provided for. It was, indeed, very possibly a suicide mission.

Was it a toxic behaviour? Their actions led to potentially saving hundreds of thousands of lives, and ensuring their own family's well-being.

I don't think their desire to help others at the cost of their own life is toxic behaviour, I think they it's heroic and commendable.

For you to suggest otherwise is pretty unfair to those people, who should be thanked. 

It's not the trait that is toxic, it's the individual behaviour, and such behaviour is not tied to masculinity.

In my example it was better than someone managed to wrestle the gun away from him. But only in that specific example. Not in *all* examples.

Another example, currently in Australia there are thousands of male volunteers endangering their lives to control this out of control fire. Some people might brand risky male behaviour as toxic masculinity. But I don't see anything toxic about what they are doing. I think to say ah, this male desire to risk their lives, so *toxic*, is very harmful."
unitedkingdom,femmapz,t1_femkaxv,1579262370.0,"If it were possible, then sure, but you're talking about rewiring millions of years of evolution. It's basically the same as trying to get all of society to find obese people physically sexually attractive. It's just not possible, it's not a conscious decision to shun weak men. Did you know almost all women date men that are taller than them? And then where the woman is taller, the relationship is significantly more likely to fail? You could argue that the solution to this is to encourage women to date short men. But it just wouldn't work, you can't really control who you're attracted to, you're just wired that way.

Same with this. You can go into the detail of attraction between the sexes (as it all comes down to that, really). We've evolved to reproduce because those who didn't reproduce, died. And females of all species have evolved to reproduce with the best males. The criteria for that in humans is to be strong, tall, healthy, dependable, *savoir faire* etc.

Half of men remaining silent comes from this, they've evolved to take on the world because if they don't they will die, just like a female peacock will only mate with a male peacock that shows a full and healthy plumage of feathers, i.e. is complete without any significant flaws.

The other half is that men's worth is tied to their ability to be strong, dependable, resourceful, and productive. It's why we have a stereotype of men not wanting to ask for directions. Because to do so doesn't just show to others they're weak - they are reluctant to even do it when they're alone in the car - it actually hurts their own ego. It makes them feel like they're less of a person to show weakness. Harms their self image. So to encourage someone to show this weakness is to encourage them to admit that they're not a strong male, which is very damaging even though you think you're trying to help. The opposite is true for women, who gain strength in sharing and discussing problems, and having others understand and appreciate their problems. But men prefer to keep them to themselves, or share them very specifically with a close trusted friend.

Men express their problems through anger because they don't want to admit that they are weak. Admitting they are weak will cause damage to them. It will not help them. The idea that you just need to open up and cry as a male is not a helpful one.

I agree about your last point entirely."

For example, if a guy is struggling because he can't support his family, the solution is to help men be able to support their families during times of crisis. Treating the symptoms of giving him a hug and telling him it's all going to be OK are not really very useful. He feels that way because he wants to be a man that can support a family. To try and undermine that will undermine his core being. To tell him it's okay if he has financial troubles is often to tell him that it's ok to be a failure.

Breaking bad was a *fantastic* example of this mentality. He had to provide for his family at all costs because he was a man and that's what men do (as he saw it). There's no way you could persuade him that it's fine to just get sick and die and fail to provide for his family, no way at all. Spoilers: Likewise, later on when he stopped making drugs, the only thing that phased him to get back into it was other people using his name to produce something inferior. His sense of pride in his work made him start again, because he has strong principles. To try and tell him it's OK and not to worry wouldn't work because his sense of self is tied to what he can do. To push crap drugs in his name undermines his own image of himself. He wants people to think of him as someone that can accomplish great things.

Someone I know was diagnosed with cancer, decided he'd be a burn to his family, walked into his shed, loaded his gun, and tried to shoot himself. It's important to understand his motivations, not just to assume that he was sad and wanted to kill himself. He wasn't sad. He was fine. It was more of a logical decision as he considered his own ego."
unitedkingdom,femja0g,t1_femfk6k,1579258438.0,"What advantage do men have?

I can guarantee that if you simply did nothing other than cry some tears, you'd have instant sympathy and help. But if you see a man crying, it's awkward and weird. It feels more like they are broken than they are upset about something, and that helping them is more like repairing them than supporting them.

If you think men are taken more seriously, just try having an opinion like this one. I'm sure someone will call me an incel sooner or later, attack my character, and call me a loser, just like the other similar posts."

It's very rare for women to marry people who earn less than them or have less social status than them.

If men are favoured more in society, why are there more men in terrible positions (on a variety of metrics) of no power - sanitation workers, builders, coal miners, loggers, taxi drivers, roofers, labourers etc? Many of those jobs require no qualifications at all so women can easily apply for them and be accepted. They're also in high demand. But they don't.

The world around you was built by men trying to invent and improve things, powered by their innate drive to be as valuable as possible so that they can reproduce. 

Cities, cars, medicine, medical treatments, toilets, anything you like, all designed and built by men who wanted to improve the world. If anyone is favoured it's the people that get to enjoy those benefits without having to have grafted to create them."

Better to offer private counselling and help, rather than encouraging men to 'speak out'. 

Speaking out and garnering support and sympathy is something that happens for women, #metoo being the huge example that united a huge number of women across the world.

Men already speak out and complain about aspects of their lives, some are bitter ( incels subreddit ) some want to highlight the unfairness and double standards in society ( mensrights ), some have been burned by past relationships or incidents ( mgtow ) some accept the state of play and try to come out on top ( theredpill ) and in all of those subreddits, most of which are filled with very unhappy traumatised men, they are called incels, losers, pathetic, and lots of subreddits automatically ban those who participate in them.

Men already talk about their problems, and vent about them, and complain, and ask why it's so unfair etc and they're treated like literal shit to the point that reddit as a platform actually encourages and endorses subreddits to mock them ( inceltears , againstmensrights etc).

There's a reason that men suffer in silence, and that's that society hates men that are suffering if their suffering is expressed with any kind of negative emotion (anger, bitterness, jealousy, contempt, etc)."

I would have thought communism is about the state controlling your life, I would assume the federation does not just let you live in an amazing house with unlimited food and recreation activities on tap with no need to work or contribute.

Without currency, I suspect you'd be granted rights, privileges and property in relation to your social standing and work contribution. I can't think of anything more communist than that. It reminds me of the game *Papers, please* where if you succeed you are given a nice apartment and maybe even medicine for your sick family if you're lucky."
