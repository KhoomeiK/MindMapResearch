bipolar,fekvz7n,t3_epntae,1579208736.0,"I think about this all the time. Someone mentioned Spinning Out on Netflix had a good scene exploring the idea of non-neurotypical love; here is the conversation (marked for spoilers):

>!""How come people like us, with fucked-up brains like ours, how do we know what love is?"" ""There was a moment."" ""A moment?"" ""\[SIGHS.\] When I realized I loved Mitch. I had just come home from the hospital, and he was brushing his teeth in the bathroom, and he smiled at me through his toothpaste. Then I realized I love this man. \[LAUGHS SOFTLY.\]"" ""The night I left home, you told me that people like you and I, we we can't always trust our instincts."" ""It's true. We can't. But we can hold onto those moments where things just suddenly feel right. It's just 'cause love isn't always an emotion for people like us. It has to be a decision. And I'm just so worried that you're gonna spend all this time trying to pin down this emotion, you're gonna go crazy, honey.""!<"

bipolar,fdj9rbn,t3_elm9dl,1578462595.0,"A lot of big questions that we are all trying to answer every day. The ups and downs you're feeling are normal, and I don't think you should view them otherwise. They are expansions and contractions just as natural as breathing, and these scary feelings are a part of the excitement that is life.  
  
Being bipolar is a lot like being a canary in a mine. Bipolar people are sensitive to things neurotypical people just aren't affected by. That does not mean that the feelings are wrong by any stretch. We absorb more, which hurts, but that price pays for a lot of new strengths which you will see in yourself in time.  
  
I hope you continue to use this subreddit as a  hub on your mental health journey; there are a lot of resources and good listeners around."
