PoliticalVideo,ffds00q,t1_ffde5m3,1579827478.0,"Since your words were identical in message to the guy you were arguing with, yes a sarcasm tag is needed. You can't say ""it's obviously sarcasm because who would say that seriously"" while replying to a guy who did exactly that."

Stepdadreflexes,ffcr55l,t1_ffc80bk,1579805539.0,So just anybody not catching anything fits in your opinion? It's clearly about humans and I guess animals screwing up with their children.

KidsAreFuckingEvil,ffb5hv6,t1_ffavrft,1579752326.0,Ah man you were doing so good but that last line just exposed you as a lonely edge lord.
Stepdadreflexes,ffao8rv,t1_ffag3m1,1579740600.0,As did I. I've seen this video 3 times in the past day. If you don't care about a sub's intended purpose then just browse r/all.

c137,ffag1j8,t3_esep7i,1579734899.0,Did I mishear a scene or did you guys get it wrong? I didn't get the impression that any actor gave Rick the ability to pause Beth.

DunderMifflin,ff8eb3r,t1_ff84g3h,1579674858.0,I mean they did that with most characters. In the first couple seasons Dwight seemed like someone you could actually meet in real life. Then there's later episodes where he basically seems like a supervillain.
DunderMifflin,ff8e8ox,t1_ff88yeu,1579674783.0,Yeah somehow a guy who won a major professional poker tournament ends up being someone who can't do math or form full sentences.

news,ff86pd0,t1_ff7zhhk,1579667534.0,I'm against a system that allows people to get that rich and then praises them by donating a fraction of their immorally gained wealth to fix society's problems in a less effective manner than if they had just paid their fair share of taxes in the first place.

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff83uds,t1_ff7zu89,1579665268.0,"But what's creepy about Brad Pitt? Also he had a fairly small role in that movie. Much more likely he's talking about the actual creepy one, Tarantino, who wrote the movie."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff83rbb,t1_ff81pux,1579665201.0,I can't help but see his smug face everytime he shows us an unnecessary close up of some girl's feet.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff7zt0n,t1_ff7vbfc,1579662306.0,Yeah you don't make that many films with Weinstein without being at the very least complicit.

donthelpjustfilm,fewg6h9,t1_fewcvfm,1579410045.0,"At least in that case you're recording evidence of something happening to your own car. What you're saying is ""I'm not going to risk something bad happen to me in order to prevent something bad happening to someone else"". What an awful attitude."

likeus,fev656n,t1_feujpjd,1579393495.0,"Yes I'm aware that they used the same word as they would for other green colours. Doesn't mean that they were unable to tell the difference in the colour of the sea vs the colour of grass.

Edit: lol also no one cares that you read Homer. I haven't and am still aware of how civilizations in the past would describe the ocean, it's a well known fact that doesn't require reading a specific piece."

rareinsults,feto4h3,t1_fetjxlx,1579377477.0,Obvious bait is obvious. You're changing the subject because you were clearly talking out your ass with your initial statement.
rareinsults,feti3iq,t1_fethevj,1579375641.0,Lol! But muh double standards! Despite the fact that men can get away with saying way more offensive shit than women.
likeus,fetf0nk,t1_feseow0,1579374772.0,Yes he didn't distinguish it as its own seperate color but I'm sure he wouldn't think it is the same color as grass.
likeus,fetepmm,t1_fesffnj,1579374664.0,What he's saying makes 0 sense. You don't need to be taught to see colours. Not having a name for a colour is not the same as not seeing it.
rareinsults,fete9ov,t1_fer545u,1579374506.0,Ok? What else do you want from me? You misunderstood the situation and made up a double standard while comparing two very different jokes. We done?
