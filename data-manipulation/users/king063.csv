ScienceTeachers,fffo3ix,t3_etd9o9,1579888121.0,"I have one! I plan on doing this when I’m teaching.

When I was in college, we had a pretty rural campus. It was filled with stray cats and squirrels. I started an Instagram called Wildlife of USM. It got fairly popular and I even passed it on before I graduated.

I’ve thought about starting something similar at a high school. I’d allow a group of science students to have access and post pictures of wildlife around the school. 

The only flaw is using social media in a school setting can be tricky. There’s some bugs to be worked out."

Honestly, Donna could fit in libright, but she usually doesn’t care about politics as long as she is well off. Honestly that philosophy works in lib right though."
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffed6no,t1_ffecq0e,1579843727.0,"As I was drawing it, I thought that perhaps Tom starts out the show at libleft and then moves towards the right as the show progresses.

His first business ventures, particularly entertainment 720, are all about expense and lavish lifestyle. This type of business was doomed from the start and Tom was dependent on safety nets.

Once he learns from Ron, he starts to understand true business prowess and has a successful startup. His philosophy has changed from “party hard to attract everyone for success” to “work hard and make legitimate income for success”."

If a chemistry lab was using hot plates, surely the tables would get colorful. 

That being said, any scientist who blindly puts their hand on a hot plate without checking if it’s on or checking the hot indicator is a moron. I imagine most accidents like this are caused by bumping into hot surfaces or putting your hands somewhere you can’t see."

I should warn you, most people on Reddit seem to believe that the doctor’s decision is extremely amoral.

It has been a couple years since I’ve seen the episode, but his scientific argument has some holes."
ScienceTeachers,ffb8zpx,t3_esnmo0,1579755573.0,"It’s a complicated topic, but I think the best approach is to eliminate the idea that evolution=atheist.

I am religious and I live in the Bible Belt. We have been told our entire lives that evolution is the lie that evil atheists invented to challenge our faith.

In reality, it’s been a point of contention that has been unintentionally designed to put people in one side or the other.

“Look at those dumb Christians that can’t accept scientific fact.”

“Look at those unholy atheists that believe in a random existence without a god.”

Unfortunately, Christians have adopted this association between evolution and atheism that shouldn’t be there. The only real argument against evolution in the Bible is that God created the earth in 6 days etc. etc., but most Christians I know believe this passage to be metaphor, and other Christians can at least be persuaded that evolution could just be the tool god used for his creation.

I’m going to approach it carefully in the classroom, but I hope to explain to students that the whole grudge between evolutionists and Christians is unfounded and only exists because it’s an easy way to split people apart.

Edit: to make my position clear, I wholeheartedly agree with evolutionary theory. After studying it in college, it just makes too much sense. I feel that Christians have just been told to disbelieve evolution and they never go back and rethink it for themselves."

enterprise,ff87z4x,t3_es30ha,1579668615.0,"I’m excited for you! ENT is my favorite of the treks.

The seasons fluctuate in tone and style a bit. Some people love season three, some people hate season three. Some people think one and two are boring, while some like the slow acceleration to big challenges.

Most people agree season 4 is best, though it’s a little weird at times.

However, ENT has probably the most universally hated finale out of all the treks. I’d suggest you watch it, but consider the previous episode the finale. Pretend the last episode is an epilogue. It’s not a bad episode. It’s enjoyable, but it has implications people don’t like."

My undergraduate university charged nearly $200 parking passes for a year. They constantly monitored parking and routinely handed out tickets for minor parking offenses. It doesn’t matter if it’s 10pm at night with no classes. No parking pass? You’ll get a ticket. Parking is horrendous and teacher parking lots are continuously empty during the day while people can’t find spaces in the auxiliary student lots.

My graduate university doesn’t even bother to check for parking passes most of the time. All of my classes are evening classes, so I didn’t bother to pay for the $25 dollar pass. I’ve never been ticketed. Parking is pretty spacious and available.

startrekgifs,feok08p,t1_feogefg,1579301240.0,My only addendum to this is to watch #3 because it has important info for 4. It has some good moments too. But it’s definitely weaker than the other TOS movies you mentioned.

In general, of the TOS movies, you should watch 2 3 4 and 6. 3 is the weakest of those, but it has its moments and it’s integral to the plot of 4 and the rest. I saw 1 well after I saw the others and I was never confused. 5 is just kinda bad.

Now, the TNG movies are pretty decent all the way through.

Generations is a little strange, but a fun watch. It bridges the gap between TOS and TNG.

First Contact is fantastic. Best trek movie hands down imo. Great solid story and very interesting setting.
