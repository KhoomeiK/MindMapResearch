snes,ffhxcwv,t3_etljsb,1579958039.0,Great game. I'm just confused why they had a level cap of 30.
Warhammer40k,ffdnz67,t3_eswdzd,1579824930.0,I thought space marines were 8'?
ImaginaryWarhammer,ffd89by,t3_esvuqh,1579815347.0,Man some people have so much talent. Can anyone spare some?
xboxone,ffanf1p,t1_ffanbqa,1579740043.0,Completely agree. If they are in gamepass and also the next upcoming sale we will probably end up saving at least 50%.
xboxone,ffan6k4,t1_ffam80x,1579739885.0,Ya I was going to buy them but they announced gamepass. I still will buy them but when they hit gamepass they also get a discount.
ImaginaryWarhammer,ff7qx0n,t3_es2832,1579656183.0,Great job.
Warhammer40k,ff7ckw7,t3_eryc9x,1579646410.0,Cool. Good luck with your apprenticeship!

BF4 had one for the subway map where you had to collapse a ceiling on an enemy and kill them with it. Problem is a soon as the round starts people shoot the damn supports down."
