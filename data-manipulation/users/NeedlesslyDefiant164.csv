I'm not saying that it was right for the man to kill him, but there is definitely a double standard when it comes to dogs in the police.

[There is a really useful BBC article that explains how it works for non-Americans.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/10067521/how-does-us-healthcare-work)
Basically doctors won't refuse you if you don't have insurance or not the money to pay for treatment.

They will send you an invoice for the cost of it. You can set up installments that suit your financial circumstances with them.

So when you need to have a big procedure done, you'll be often stuck with a huge bill, even if you have insurance. There is co-pay the ratio of which depends on how your insurance plan is. If you have no/bad insurance you're fucked for the rest of your life.

At least Obamacare alleviates some of these problems by covering medical costs for the poor. Now you only have to worry about not making enough money for decent insurance *and* making too much money to qualify for Obamacare. 

Healthcare costs are the primary reason for bankruptcies in the US. That's fucked up.
