CasualConversation,ff2lxv3,t1_ff2lqr9,1579512445.0,"I agree, helping others can help yourself as well. I has helped me on the occasion, definately. if im honest, im not sure what sparked my change, but im glad for it. Sometimes things happen spontaneously, sometimes they take time.

Hey, do you want to continue this conversation in DMs?"
CasualConversation,ff2lib9,t1_ff2lawe,1579511792.0,"Yeah, I understand that one. If there's any advice I can give you, or anyone, it's to take care of yourself and make sure you are in a decent place before talking to and trying to help someone else. I know personally that when someone is down, they tend to obsorb other bad events and words and feelings around them. And so listening to someone vent while you are feeling bad can end up poisoning you, if you know what I mean. Its not selfish to take care of yourself first, and I think alot of people need to realise that. Not that im saying if we feel bad we should shove everyone else aside, just that we need to be aware of what we can and can't handle.

Morbidly, we can't care for someone else if we are dead, yknow?"
CasualConversation,ff2l6ur,t1_ff2kyd4,1579511322.0,"I sure hope so! I know it wasn't allways easy to try and be better, and I spent a good year not wanting to be better at all. 
It scares me and pains me to think that there are people out there suffering, and wanting to keep suffering because of one reason or another. I hope that I might be able to help them, but sometimes decisions like wanting to be better need to be made by the person, when they realise they want help. Because trying to talk to someone who doesn't want to listen is like talking to a brick wall. They need to come to that decision themselves."
CasualConversation,ff2kt55,t1_ff2kj7q,1579510769.0,"Same, honestly. I have an issue where I know what I want to say, but when I go and say it it just comes out in annoying stutters and the sentence just can't make its way out of my mouth. I persist though. Because I am a stubborn bastard, and I dont know when to stop. :P

But I hope you can learn to deal with this, as I have been. Since ive dropped out of school and moved to corospondence, (home school/online) ive gained confidence I havent felt in years, or ever really, and im finally finding the time to learn how to live again, and enjoy life instead of live in stress and fear of, well, everything. Im getting there, slowly. And for what it's worth, im proud of myself."
CasualConversation,ff2e1lq,t1_ff2ds85,1579502310.0,"I know what you mean, I've had my fair share of embarrassment on reddit replies. I closed my previous account because of it. I try not to reply nowadays, I remind myself that im not required to and no one will particularly care if I dont reply. But if its a question i can usually answer. I hate closed ended comments, like, how do you reply to a statement?"
CasualConversation,ff2cuwg,t1_ff2cizi,1579501053.0,"Haha, I usually try and cover awkward silence with too much talking, and that doesn't allways end well."
