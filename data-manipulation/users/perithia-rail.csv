fatlogic,fe44w6i,t1_fe2myqb,1578855800.0,"Some people are just ""lucky"" like that. I lost about 100lbs, and my cup size actually increased, went from a 38A to a 32D. 

That said, since I've gotten down into the 120lb range I have seen em start to go down a bit, but since 120lb is my goal weight, I'm not too upset."

creepy,fdoopse,t1_fdonwiq,1578609494.0,"Obviously it may be different in Germany, but my local library (I live in Canada) has an incredible selection on ebooks on top of you know, normal books. At least that way you can get reading them! 

I actually haven't started any of Sanderson's work yet, because I looked up his bibliography and was overwhelmed by the sheer number of books. I haven't decided where to start!"
AdviceAnimals,fdo7y0k,t1_fdo6wwo,1578600452.0,"Hahah 100%, that's what I said when my mom called me Flexitarian.  She apparently makes the distinction because when I am cooking for myself or my husband/family/close friend is cooking for me, I make a point for it to be vegetarian, but if someone I don't know well has gone through the trouble of making me something with meat in, I don't mind."

entwives,fdn36bv,t1_fdn2n9c,1578575922.0,"We have lucked the fuck out on the financial side of things. Our vet has been a total gem sticking within the quote she gave us at the start, and my new job is a salaried position with benefits,  so we've been able to use our healthcare savings on his care (but, we're also Canadian so like, it was for dental/vision anways). My parents also helped us out a bit financially too.

This whole experience has reminded me how blessed my husband and I are, we had some of our hockey friends pay thier registration fees early when they heard Murdy was sick, as we pay the team fees and everyone else just gets us back. Not to mention the emotional support you guys have given me here, it means the world.

We're so luck for our real life and internet friends."

entwives,fdn2gus,t1_fdn283j,1578575299.0,"Thank you! We never thought he would have gotten crystals, as his completely raw food diet has SO much water in it, but he must have a wicked genetic predisposition to it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. He's doing really well, the vet said he should be home today or tomorrow! They're just waiting for his cathater bag to be crystal free, then he's coming home."

entwives,fdiykxk,t1_fdic6td,1578454013.0,"Thanks so much! I think once he gets home and on his new special diet, he'll feel loads better. He had his surgery this morning, and it went well, but the vet wanted to keep him overnight. They *might* keep him tomorrow night too, but we won't know that until tomorrow. Fingers crossed he's through the worst of it."

entwives,fdhfqrc,t1_fdhex68,1578421697.0,"Of course! I know lots of you guys have pets too, so I'll definitely keep updating.
I kinda get where they're coming from, I dobt think I've eaten anything but a bowl of egg fried rice since Monday morning, I can only guess who poor his appetite has been."
entwives,fdhe7sk,t1_fdhcjjn,1578420780.0,"Oh girl, my condolences. I try to give them all the cuddles I can, they deserve so many more cudz than we can give them."
entwives,fdhc4co,t1_fdh38fz,1578419736.0,"Our vet said that the raw we had our cats on might have been a contributing factor in his developing crystals, so I would bear that in mind (but honestly, I'm a little confused by that, as our guy developed struvite oxolate crystals, which form in alkaline conditions. Raw food diets tend to acidify the digestive tract and urine so idk how it would have contributed. Probably too much phosphorous and magnesium, would be my guess?). 

He's on the urinary diet at the moment and we'll keep on it until our vet tells us otherwise. Ive never had to use it before, but my friends had a really good go with it when their baby got crystals, so I'm not too worried about that side of things üòÖ"
entwives,fdhbp8e,t1_fdh3dek,1578419514.0,"Thanks so much for the support. My husband stopped by after his class this morning and Murdoch was in surgery. So hopefully that will be that and the urinary diet will fix him up too. He didn't seem to want to eat it last night, I'm hoping he was just so dopey from his medication that he simply wasn't hungry."
entwives,fdh25pv,t3_ekxga0,1578413754.0,What a cute little hippo you have!! I hope you guys had a great day ‚ò∫Ô∏è
entwives,fdh1m9q,t1_fdgsj2o,1578413411.0,"The vet said that Murdy's was probably set off by stress inflammation too (my husband is his person, and the hubs went to see some friends pretty suddenly). 

Poor things, I didn't know that crystals could be stress linked, so I was really shocked when we heard the diagnosis. He was on a raw diet, and he seemed to drink lots of water, so I didn't expect crystals.

In a way though, I'm sorta glad? It's something common, so the vets really know what they're doing. It sounds like your vet is as contentious about pain management as ours is, our little boy's been pretty doped up, our pet cubby looks like a tiny pharmacy too!"
entwives,fdgw2x5,t1_fdgpxln,1578409764.0,"Its short for Murdoch actually, though Murder Kitten was 100% accurate for him as a kitten! 
Thanks so much for the support! He and my hubby are very close, so if I'm feeling so badly I can only imagine how hard it's been for them. He's in great hands though, our vet is amazing!"
entwives,fdgplyd,t1_fdgp224,1578404955.0,"I wish we had gotten one sooner. I work in pet store, so I've been trying to convince my husband for ages that we should get then a fountain! Murdy is a 3yo neutered male, so I wanted one for him for a while. 
We have one now though, and he seems to like it!"
