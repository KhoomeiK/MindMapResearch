She kept going on how I should go back to my country and what not.  I'm starting to become more and more furious. That I couldn't take it any more and I screamed at her, basically telling her to shut the fuck up and to go back to the rat's nest that she crawled out of and to leave me and people alone.

Warthunder,ff96idh,t3_esdaoi,1579705999.0,"Engine: 2× gasoline ZMZ-4905 120 hp (88.2 kW) (×2)

Power/weight20 hp/tonneSuspensionwheeled 8×8

Operational range 400–600 kmSpeed80 km/h, swim 9 km/h

The BTR-70 came out first as the industrial prototype GAZ-4905 and was closesly based on the BTR-60PB in 1967-68, most of the changes been applied to the hull. It was tested for two years before being accepted for production in 1970, and for service on August 21, 1972, hence the BTR (which stands for “Bronetransportyor”) “70” before of the decade. In reality most were delivered in the 1980s.  Although still very close to the original design, with the same internal configuration (driver at the front, crew compartment in the middle, engine at the rear), the BTR-70 had a sleeker profile, sowewhat less bulky. It was much longer (7.86 instead of 7.56 m), narrower (3 cm) and taller (1 cm), the BTR-70 was also heavier (11.5 tons vs 10.3 tons on the BTR-70PB) although part of this weight was due to bigger engines. The all-welded hull was made of RHA, fully waterproof. In this respect, the BTR-70 was like its predecessor, capable of swimming with minimal preparation (erection of the front trim vane and bilge pumps switched on). Some effort was put on the protection which better armour plating although its thickness remained unchanged at 10 mm front, 7 mm sides and rear and 5 mm elsewhere. This provided some cover from front against heavy machine guns, and small arms fire although the folded trim vane and possible addition of welded plates on the front beak could provide extra protection.  The supplementary weight of the vehicle was at first coped with a pair of 115 hp GAZ-69B 6-cylinder engines, and later compensated by a much better engine, a couple of ZMZ-49-05 gasoline engines which gave an output of 120 hp (88.2 kW) each, and a Power/weight of 20 hp/tonne. This was 240 hp combined, compared to the 180 hp of the previous serie, which seemed underpowered in comparison. However despite this surge in power, performances were similar: It could reach 80 km/h on flat, and swim to 9 km/h thanks to a rear hull single water jet. Operational range was roughly also the same at 400 to 600 km.

Warthunder,fe9odop,t3_eo80gc,1578939952.0,"By the late 1940s, the United States Navy was interested in the mixed-power concept for its shipborne fighters – i.e. aircraft with a mixture of propeller and turbojet engines, such as the FR Fireball. As such, an order was placed with Curtiss on 7 April 1944 for delivery of three mixed-power aircraft, designated the F15C. Powered by both a 2,100 hp (1,566 kW) Pratt & Whitney propeller engine, and an Allis-Chalmers J36 turbojet, the aircraft was in theory the fastest fighter in the US Navy at that time. The first flight of the first prototype was on 27 February 1945, without the turbojet installed. When this was completed in April of the same year, the aircraft flew several mixed-power trials, however on 8 May, it crashed on a landing approach. The second prototype flew for the first time on 9 July, again in 1945, and was soon followed by a third prototype. Both aircraft showed promise, however, by October 1946, the Navy had lost interest in the mixed-power concept and cancelled further development.
