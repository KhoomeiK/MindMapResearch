MMA,fc4tce0,t1_fc2azft,1577427647.0,I'm a Korean and Frankie supporter. This one was really tough to watch. I like KZ but I'm a really big fan for Frankie Edgar. I believe Frankie's time is not over yet. Its upsetting to see KZ not getting title shot after shutting down legend like Frankie Edgar. People are underrating Frankie so hard after his loss against Ortega and Max. Max was in conversation for GOAT of featherweight and Ortega was upperdog against Max and he was undefeated before he faced Max. Honestly I couldn't believe the result of Frankie vs KZ. KZ's striking accuracy was just shocking. It was absolutely work of art. I guess Eddie Cha is really underrated.
MMA,fc1oo6w,t1_fbwr0xw,1577324905.0,I think it was unfortunate since Zombie didn't know due to poor translation of person who explained rule to Zombie. Zombie thought it was standard Muay Thai rule which allow spinning back fist. Zombie said is very sorry and he didn't know the rule set properly due to poor translation. He looked very sad I felt bad for him.
