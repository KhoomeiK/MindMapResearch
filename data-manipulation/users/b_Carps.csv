AskReddit,ffcs625,t3_esse9d,1579806156.0,"At a conference, I went to the coffee shop and there was a huge line. I was hungry and when I got in line, the line got a lot longer. Once the barista poured my drink and gave me my bagel, I looked in my wallet and behold! My credit card was gone. I left it in my hotel room. He said no worries and let me have it for free. Only thing he said was ""pass it on brotha."" And that truly stuck with me."
