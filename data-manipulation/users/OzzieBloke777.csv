popping,ffiw3q1,t3_etjwiy,1579984118.0,"Vet here.  Time to clear up the arguments in this post:  

There is growing evidence that leaving dogs intact has certain benefits.  In large breed dogs particularly, the hormonal input tends to result in stronger bone and ligaments, particularly the ACL in the stifle (the knee - it makes no detectable difference to hip dysplasia as others have suggested), a reduction in urinary incontinence in bitches, a reduction in prostatic cancer in dogs (but not prostatitis or prostatic hyperplasia, these inevitably are worse in intact male dogs), and better weight management.  

That said, an intact bitch who is not being bred runs an ever-growing risk of pyometron with every season they go through without breeding, and is more prone to mammary cysts and mammary cancer.  A male intact dog will also be more prone to testosterone-mediated conditions such as anal furunculosis, prostatitis, not to mention an increase in overall aggression on average.  

There is an effective compromise that is becoming more widely accepted in the veterinary industry for male and female large-breed dogs:  
For females, doing a hemi-spey at 6 months removing the uterus and 1 ovary, and then removing the remaining ovary at 2-3 years of age.  
For males, vasectomizing at 6 months, and then performing castration at 2-3 years.  
With the above, you get the benefits of the hormonal input for growth and development when it is needed, with a marked reduction in later-life medical issues.  The biggest issue becomes weight gain after full sterilization, but this boils down to appropriate feeding after the fact - a higher protein and fat, lower carbohydrate diet, in moderation.

For small-breed dogs under 20lbs or 10kg, there is no noted difference in leaving them entire beyond 6 months of age, so we still recommend full spey or castrate for them at 6 months of age."
