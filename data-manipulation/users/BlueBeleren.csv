 Like having a fake model against a fake backdrop sells the whole thing. I feel like if you were to put actors on a set inside a rendered ship, and have it be attacked by a rendered monster would just not do it justice. The scale of it all would make it hard to capture the vibe.

It's kind of like watching King Kong or Godzilla, or even that scene out of The Phantom Menace where their little sub gets attacked. It can look good, but you just kind of know it's fake. Or you have to shoot it in a way that obscures stuff.

MagicArena,ff9vfd4,t1_ff99y05,1579722349.0,"It's like a 73.8% match win rate. Practically winning twice as often as you lose. Now it is unranked, so I'd expect anybody above like, Gold (not sure where the bell curve lies) to have an above 50% ratio. But 74%? That's Mythic and up. That's quite difficult to do.

Yes, it's easier than bo1 (81%, if you're wondering), but not by a ton."
MagicArena,ff9u5v0,t3_esct65,1579721385.0,"I can summarize the math!     

GW% will stand for game win rate. MW% for match win rate. CG for consistent gains and EP for evaluated profit (evaluated meaning it takes the value of non-currency rewards into account like ICRs, wild cards and packs. Packs valued at 1000 coin or 200 gems. The rest valued at: it's complicated.)
    
    
    
**Standard Event**

CG: 56.7 GW%/60 MW%

EP at 50 GW%: 320 gold

Very good way to earn gold. No matchmaking. CG should be easily achievable for any Gold/Platinum ranked players and up.

**Traditional Standard Event**

CG:  55.1 MW%

EP at 50 MW%: 497 gold

Even better but isn't always around. Best way to earn gold. Note that 55.1 MW% is probably like 52 GW%.

**Draft Event**

CG: 74.7 GW%/84 MW%

EP at 50 GW%:  209 gems

Usually ranked, which means that 74.7% is basically impossible. 209 gems of profit at 50% is decent profit if you're paying in gems. It's bad if you're paying in gold. (959 total evaluated yield - 750 entry free = 209 gems. But 959 x 5 only comes out to 4795. 4795 - 5000 = -205). So why buy in with gold? It's a bad exchange rate, but it's the only way to convert gold to gems.

**Traditional Draft Event**

CG: 73.8 MW%

EP at 50 MW%: 126 gems.

Not as good a payout gem wise as B-o-1, but it's easier to earn bigger than just what you'd get for a 50% average here. It's unranked, but 73.8% is still a very high percentage. Mythic and high diamond players might be able to pull off the CG here.

**Sealed Event**

CG: 81 GW%/90.5 MW%

EP at 50%: 295 gems

While it technically has the best EP it has the worst CG. You will eventually be out of currency playing this. Good to play at the start of a new expansion I suppose, as a way to build up your base card collection.


**Summary**

Well for starters, consistent gains are only realistically achievable in Standard events and maaaaybe Traditional Draft. As such, there's basically no way to consistently increase your gem count aside from achieving the consistent gains win percentage in Standard, then converting all that gold into gems.

A note on Evaluated Profit. It includes all the packs you get from the Event, the value of wild cards and your chances at ICRs. Hitting your 50 GW%/MW% does not mean you'll see the number listed beside the EP payout added to your currencies. Instead your account has gained that much value.


So! play Traditional Standard > B-o-1 Standard to earn coins. Convert those coins to gems in B-o-1 draft. If you are a talented drafted, you can then take your gems over to traditional draft to add value to your account, but do not expect to see a consistent increase in your gems unless you can maintain that 73-74 MW%, which is quite high and likely only possible to achieve because it's unranked. 

Keep in mind that statistics play out best over time. Even if you did have a 74% win rate in draft, you'd need a gem pile large enough to cover any loss streaks for long enough that it started to make you gems.

Wife believes in God, and Jesus and several other more... believable biblical tales. At times things can get tense when talking about her faith, because while I'm open minded, my beliefs are founded by facts, and without proof, I just can't be swayed. Our conversations often end with me saying something along the lines of, ""It's possible, but I don't believe it."" Much to her annoyance.

She's quite smart though. More intelligent than myself in plenty of ways. From my perspective, she just needs, wants, and enjoys her faith. It can give her hope. Some people need that. That's not a failing.

Some people don't need it. In contrast to her I can be a tad nihilistic. Which leads to both impulsivity and procrastination. I live in the now because I don't think there's an after. That's my coping mechanism. At times that can be counter productive or even downright destructive. My wife is none of these things. She's constantly worrying about death, fearful of either punishment or oblivion, but she has savings, she has a life plan.

My point to anybody reading this is that there are pros and cons to everything. Being an atheist does not give me the right to refute someone else's beliefs when I've no proof they can't be real (again, we're talking about rational Catholics here, not gay bashing, Satan planted the fossils, radical evangelicals) anymore than Steve Harvey has a right to down talk anybody who states that they're an atheist.

If by the age of five you haven't calibrated your ""moral barometer"" so that it reads, ""I don't like getting punched in the face, so I will not punch people in the face, with the hope they do not do that to me"" then I don't know what to tell you Steve, you might be a moron. The people that need the threat of eternal damnation just so that they treat others with a bit of decency are the real psychos if you ask me."
reptiles,fexoq3r,t3_eq6yow,1579434168.0,"You don't use thermostats with heating bulbs and here's why; you need to place the probe right on the basking spot. As soon as your beardie crawls over and lays on that probe it'll read colder and the heat will spike. Not only that but your reptile can move the probe out of position, also causing the heat to spike.

What you need to do is set up a bulb with a set output and use a thermometer to check the temperature of the basking spot. Change the distance between the bulb and basking spot until you get it in range.

The good news is, is that when bulbs fail they just go out. With heating pads or radiators, they can overheat when they fail, so a probe and thermostat are necessary to kill the power if that happens.

I use thermostats and probes to monitor all the heat pads on my boa enclosure. There's a probe for each of the heat pads on the exterior walls, and the one for her ""basking spot"" is taped to the enclosure floor, has a reptile mat on top of it and then about three or four inches of substrate on top of that to prevent her from meddling with it. The thermostat also has range alarms built in. Seems excessive? Cold-blooded reptiles will not move themselves away from a heat source that's too hot. They don't have that same preservation instinct that mammals have. This means they will burn themselves if given the chance. Reptiles do not do well with burns. They can often be life threatening. Do everything in your power to avoid them.

Someone else already mentioned a bulb cage. This is also a crucial step and the temperature of that metal cage should also be check. If possible, It's better to mount the bulb well out of reach or even outside the enclosure above a mesh top."

reptiles,fexknj9,t3_eqjnoc,1579432527.0,"There's already been some helpful tips here, but considering that they are indeed difficult to care for I'm happy to provide a few more!

Savannah monitors are often carrion feeders. When he or she gets a little bigger, some fresh raw meat is a nice treat, alongside mice, rats and the occasional egg. Don't feed live rats if you can help it (some critters are picky, though I've yet to see that in a Savannah). Insects won't quite be enough once they enter their teen years.

They need a lot of space. And space doesn't come cheap in terms of aquariums. Someone else mentioned a 75 gallon tank. But an adult will need at least 200. Ask your local aquarium shops if they have any cracked tanks! While a 200 gallon aquarium is usually thousands of dollars, they'll usually let one that won't hold water go for a few hundred.

Coconut husk and moss will make for a decent substrate in which the little one can burrow. It's mold resistant, which is essential for high humidity enclosures and when wet makes for good burrowing structure.

Heat bulbs. They have a high temperature basking requirement. Heat pads are tempting, and I use them myself (in conjunction with probes for constant monitoring) for other reptiles, but they just don't reliably provide the kind of heat you need here. Mount a heating bulb in a reflecting dome aimed at a basking rock. Use a thermometer to get the spacing right before the monitor's allowed near it, reptiles don't do well with burns. If a heat bulb fails, it goes out. If a heat pad or radiant device fails, it can actually overheat, so they require constant monitoring with probes that'll force a shut off.

... As you can probably start to tell, Savannah Monitor's are fairly involved. If you do choose to continue to care for this reptile, you should also know that it won't be very rewarding. They can be very temperamental, defensive and don't always appreciate being handled. Herpetology enthusiasts like them for the challenge they present, and for how large they get.

So that misting is just to counter act that. I open one of her enclosure doors though? It drops to 40% and keeps falling in only a few minutes.

A mesh enclosure? Even with three walls covered, good luck. Unless you're going to be covering those walls with soaked sponges, the humidity in there's going to be whatever the humidity of the room is.

I initially thought the sorcery and instant versions were worthwhile in the same way, ones that gain you life and tap creatures and so on.

The problem is that you'll eventually run out of cards in your graveyard, or cards in your deck if you're fueling your graveyard. And while gaining life or tapping creatures *might* win you the game, for the most part sinking your mana into those abilities turn after turn is just a stall. I've come to the conclusion that they're okay if you're ahead, but quite bad if you're behind on board state.

The one that has an opponent lost 2 life may be a different story, as it could possibly cinch you a game. I've yet to playtest it.

The creatures on the other hand are magnificent in limited. Trading in combat or having them removed is almost always a 2 for 1. Hell, even if they exile it from your graveyard after a trade is a 2 for 1. Your worst case scenario is It's dealt with in such a way that it doesn't find the graveyard. In which case it's been a straight trade anyways. 

In constructed? I feel like there's only a handful of escape cards that I'd want to build a graveyard fueling deck around. And those cards are expensive in terms of mana or the number of cards you need to exile. I've been toying with it, but I can't see it becoming a Tier 1 strategy yet.

Avoid the question at the end though. That's one of my favorite tactics. In any conversation, dating or otherwise, asking a question displays uncertainty, if even only subconsciously. End your statement on; ""I want to take you on a date."" And let her respond. If you ASK to take her on the date, she gets to keep playing hard to get. But if you leave it as a closed statement, now It's her turn to talk, and she needs to address it with a statement of her own, rather than an answer. It helps show assertiveness and confidence.

Think of that even in the workplace. People always say, ""Feel free to ask questions, it's better to ask somebody if you don't know."" But there's a BETTER way to handle that situation. Instead of going, ""Hey boss, I don't really know, can you teach me/tell me what to do?"" Assert yourself with ""I've never done/seen this before. Show me how to do this correctly.""

DC current is crazy fast. So fast that anything we measure it with basically just states that it's continuous. It's purely theory that it does fluctuate, but that theory isn't contested anymore than say, the theory of gravity.

I've yet to really delve into why that is, but if I had to make an outlandish guess that could very likely be completely incorrect, I'd say it has to do with the electrons themselves. As they move and carry a charge along, you'd have a pattern of electron, no electron, electron, no electron... or better described as the electrons and the incredibly small spaces in between them. I imagine this takes places at speeds too fast for us to catch on instrumentation we use to observe electrons. All that said, these incredibly small fluctuations present in DC current are probably also present WITHIN the sinoidal fluctuating of AC current.

blackmagicfuckery,fdh4mni,t1_fdgyhqr,1578415277.0,"Break it down even further why don't we!

All electricity fluctuates. AC does so at specific and controlled Hz. For example 60 Hz AC passes through a ""zero"" point of power emission 120 times a second. DC on the other hand is a little more complicated, in that it can't be measured in Hz because it's not cyclical, but has a singular current direction. It's fluctuations are infinitely numerous and practically immeasurable, but they do exist. Picture the target for DC current as being zapped by electricity in a rapid fire way.

Because of that, you can see incandescent bulbs flicker or strobe in a similar fashion to what you're describing. It's less common (because the heat generated in the tungsten doesn't typically wane fast enough that the metal stops irradiating between peaks), but it can be caught on camera, or even by the naked eye, especially with older bulbs that use inferior materials and low frequency AC current.

What this means though is that ALL technology flickers and strobes, if only because at the very root of it, the electricity we use to power it does. What's interesting is we can further rectify that power so that it's less prone to do this, by layering AC sine waves (usually achieved by diode configurations, blah de blah science), but on the other hand, the more efficient the technology we create (see incandescent vs. LED) the more likely we are to see the results of poorly rectified electricity."

In the laminar flow video, CD explains how syncing frame rates up to hertz isn't what causes, or what laminar flow is.

But the effect achieved in OP's video is achieved by syncing up a strobe light to the drip rate of water and has nothing to do with laminar flow. It may not have to do with the camera specifically, but like in the helicopter video where it's frame rate and blade rotation, here the capture effect (the strobe being on) is also being synced to the visual (water droplets when they pass through certain heights).

I replied to this jerk earlier with a much lengthier and more in depth description explaining these differences. He's been linking his video everywhere and it's really not all that applicable. If anything, it describes how to achieve certain water effects using frame rates and syncing them to other effects on the water, some of which are very similar to this. It then goes on to say that that's not how laminar flow is achieved, which while correct, seems to be the only part that the guy you're replying to listened to.

OP's video is NOT laminar flow AND DOES use a syncing technique to achieve the illusion. It likely has nothing to do with the camera though, using a strobing light instead."

Laminar flow and a helicopter's blades appearing to be stuck are two very different things. As are laminar flow and the effect that's happening in the OP.

Laminar flow has to do with water aligning itself into very specific streams, and can be done by anything that has a relatively small nozzle and a consistent and constant emmitance. The example used in your video by Captain Disillusion accomplishes this my sectioning off a small part of a large water balloon with tape, then puncturing a hole in that section. The tape keeps the puncture from tearing and popping the balloon, and as the balloon deflates, it creates the conditions for laminar flow.  You're right in asserting that shutter speed has nothing to do with this.

However, the comment you replied to has to do with strobing effects and helicopter blades. How does that relate to the OP video you ask? Well, I'll tell you.

The effect in the originally posted video is NOT laminar flow. It's a visual trick using a consistent DRIPPING of water, and not a stream. It's done by dropping water droplets at a steady rate, then flashing a strobe light over the droplets, so that when the strobe is on you can see them, and when it's off you can't. Syncing that strobe effect allows you to create an illusion that the water droplets are held in place, but in reality you're just seeing the next droplet in place of the last one. A slightly faster strobe makes them appear to travel upwards, where a slower strobe would make them seem as if they were falling slower. THIS video explains that effect: https://youtu.be/OtxlQTmx1LE

It's also why the droplets appear to shake and shimmer. It's because they're different droplets and not the same shape as the last one that the strobe lit up.

The comment that you replied to was explaining this in fewer words to someone who had asked: ""Why can't you see the strobe?"" Now, this may or may not have to do with shutter speeds and could just be because the strobe is too fast for the human eye to catch. The example they listed with floating helicopters though DOES have to do with shutter speeds/frame rates. What happens here is that a helicopters blades rotate at a certain rpm. If you can match your frame rate to that rpm (Or to 3/4, 1/2, 1/4 blah blah you get it, divisible by the number of blades), it'll capture the blades in a certain position, only to capture them again in that same position. This makes it seem like the blades aren't moving while everything else is. You can see that effect here: https://youtu.be/VfihH-O_0eg 
Notice how the rear rotator is still spinning but what looks to be a weird rate. It isn't in sync, unlike the over head blades.

For clarification neither the droplet effect, or the helicopter effect have to do with laminar flow. Both the droplet effect and helicopter effect do incorporate some form of ""syncing"" whether it's a strobe light or shutter speed/frame rate. Laminar flow does not use any kind of ""syncing"", but there was no reason for you to bring it up, though it is a nice seeing it.


EDIT: Strobing not stroking.


Also, much like in the very video you shared at 6:24 ""Catching a glimpse of one interesting phenomenon and then casually drawing a tenuous mental link to another one you've heard of is not knowledge or expertise."" You've gone around telling a few people they're wrong in this very comment section, linking to a video about laminar flow DISAMBIGUATION. The video you linked literally talks about this and then goes on to show you what laminar flow actually is. I shouldn't have made this edit but that bothered me a little. They're two different things. Sure, you can call people out on their terminology (maybe it's not shutter speed and actually frame rate, or perhaps the industry standard prefers Hertz), but the people you're replying to actually have the right idea, and you're telling them that they don't because you're the one that's drawn that tenuous mental link."

But you'll have a hard time shutting down the roaming super with maybe the exception of Stormcaller. It is better if you're looking to snag a few kills rather than just one off your super though.

I think OP's ideology, after watching his video, is that he's confident in his neutral game and gun play. He doesn't worry about racking up kills with a super as he does just fine before that. So instead of trying to go for broke when the bar turns yellow, he opts for a super that shuts down people trying to end his streak.
