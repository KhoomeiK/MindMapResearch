AskReddit,ffv4rrm,t3_evbsyg,1580255660.0,"An old boyfriend from high school killed himself when we were 33. I hadn’t spoken to him since we were 25, but that was because he moved to France and I got married and had kids, not for any difficult reason. 

When I heard, I was really angry with myself for not doing a better job of staying in touch. I was angry with him because he should have known I would have dropped everything to go help him through whatever he was going through. 

But, when I learned about his drug addiction and how miserable he was (even though his life looked great from the outside) I was kind of proud of him and happy that he was finally at peace. I know the proud part sounds weird, but I don’t have a better word. 

He was a really interesting and intelligent guy, and the world is less without him in it."
Wellthatsucks,ffsfqou,t1_ffsebjg,1580180602.0,"So I have to ask about desserts, and Chinese food, interestingly. I don’t ever eat cookies or whatever unless I know the person who made it says ok to me. No pies or cheesecake in a restaurant unless I ask about the crust. Anything packaged for wide scale production is fine, but I just don’t want to eat it anyway.

I went to hospital one time many years ago because I ate bacon wrapped shrimp, and there were some kind of nuts mixed up in the bacon. So that’s the Chinese thing. 

My allergy isn’t as crazy as some. You can eat nuts near me and as long as you don’t kiss me I’m ok"

BernieSanders,ffs5gq1,t1_ffs3mhh,1580173612.0,"Dude, he’s proposing a tax on speculation. You got money? You think you can make more? Ok, pay Uncle Sam a small cut of your stock market buy. Rich people buy and sell stocks all the time.

It’s not about cutting back, we’re (if President Sanders takes office) going to pay for social programs by taxing the rich on doing what they already do, and they won’t stop doing it because paying a small tax on a transaction that could be very very lucrative is a small price to pay.

u/jirski, I have never bought or sold stocks except through a 403b retirement fund, because I’m a teacher and I’m pretty broke. But this is how I understand Senator Sanders’ plan to expand social programs and  mitigate student debt."

The first plane hit while I was walking there; my friends said “a plane flew into the World Trade Center) and we figured it was a lost pilot of a Cessna or something. We watched the second plane hit live. We sat there for about 20 minutes watching the news while the kids played and then we all went home.

AskReddit,fdiaz9x,t3_elg9n6,1578438945.0,"So I dated a guy much older than me and I moved in with him at barely 17. When that went bad, I moved back home for a few months at 19, then I got a job working as a counselor for developmentally delayed boys 2nd shift and rented a cheap apartment (365 a month) and got back into school while keeping the 3-11 job, which was awesome because everyone went to bed early.

I moved to another company working 3-11 at a group home for delayed adult women. Kept taking a full load of classes as long as I could get to work by 3. It was an even better job bc they were pretty self sufficient and I had medical benefits and a bit of tuition remission.

.The worst semester was when I was student teaching every day at an inner city high school, booking it out to the suburbs to work, and then back home after 11. Also I took a night class on my night off. Also my apartment burned down in the middle of that semester. And I got an underage alcohol offense (two months shy of 21) which meant I drove for a full year without a license. Or insurance, bc who has the money for that?

I would definitely recommend looking into working as a counselor in a group home situation. I was paid pretty well, it allowed me to pay my bills, but I was also poor enough to get grants for school.

It really does tell a lot about a person, though. Sometimes it stumps them, and they hem and haw bc they aren't really avid readers.
