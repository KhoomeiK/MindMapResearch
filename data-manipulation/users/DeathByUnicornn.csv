SelfAwarewolves,ff6631l,t1_ff6592e,1579620019.0,"I said force, not bullets (example: occupy Wall Street). You seem to think it’s either one extreme or another. Although my ideas may sound extreme, I only suggested them because convincing people you have a great plan and winning elections doesn’t work (in my opinion, to be fair). The problem is not necessarily just the people we elect, but the system as a whole. Unfortunately, people hold the keys to this corrupt system, so they’re out way in.

I don’t want to forcibly remove a crooked politician only to put in another that I think is “better”.

I want the whole fucking thing to be destroyed. Sure, as a country we’ll be lost for some time. Yet one of our greatest brags is our resilience and unwillingness to back down. 


SO, that being said, we would survive. I do understand what you’re getting at, and if I had any faith in our government, I’d be right there marching with you.

Thank you for taking the time to comment and share your thoughts. It’s always beneficial to hear ideas, even if they conflict with your own. Especially if it can help you realize you’re wrong about something."
