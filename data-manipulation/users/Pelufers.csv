sex,ff4spm7,t3_ergt4k,1579571528.0,"First of all, I'm so sorry for all the sexual advances via pm that you're getting.  Men are terrible people and they all have to shoot their shot so to speak.  

Secondly, a human intimate relationship works best when both people involved are happy with it.  It's about how you both feel, not anyone else.  

Viewing sex acts and favors in a relationship as rewards or privileges is never going to end well.  It turns the relationship transactional and the intimate actions become currency instead of togetherness. 

It works better if the people in the relationship discuss their likes and dislikes and interact sexually in a way that both parties agree with and enjoy.  The facials seem to be like that for you and your partner.  So just....enjoy.  try not to consider your friends opinions as much in reference to your relationship.  It'll taint your relationship and experiences."
BDSMcommunity,ff4h3ux,t3_erfc1e,1579563463.0,"As a teen, I used to play this game with my friends where we would jump in bushes and see how cut up we would get.    That, and liking mosh pits, and I liked the experience of getting piercings done.  The rush, the shock, the silent moment that always happens when someone is right about to inflict pain on you.  

As an adult, I like masochism because I think it makes a sexual experience thrilling.  More about the journey and less about trying to get to the end asap."

BDSMcommunity,feddbsx,t1_fed5wle,1579008306.0,"Oh God.  How I wish it were a small number of men.  Unfortunately finding a man who is in bdsm for the right reasons, not a narcissist who actually wants to dominate for real, not some dude who just wants an easy lay, it's difficult.  It involves a lot of sifting through piles of men who are all trying to trick you into thinking they have good intentions.  Female submissives looking for male Doms basically have to be detectives to find someone good.  Getting involved in a community is best because your friends help you vet someone new, and protect you.     Without that it's like jumping into the tiger pit at the zoo to look for a nice house cat to take home."

relationships,fddli1z,t3_ekjj7e,1578316819.0,"I used to be married and this was always an issue for me.  If I ever live with another intimate partner again, different bedrooms is going to be a non negotiable. I value my ""me"" time and have a lot of hobbies that cause clutter, and also, I'd like a place to go to during fights.  Before or after the discussion part where you just want to deliberate solo."
sex,fdcnxej,t3_ekjyif,1578279615.0,I like stretching.  Something about the combination of the nice feelings stretching gives and the nice feeling of his cock inside me at the same time.  Just like stretching my arms up for a minute or something like that.
Divorce,fdc2pr0,t1_fdbtvza,1578265925.0,"People that leave marriages of their own volition don't need anyone's sympathy.  They're happier as is, which is why they chose to leave.  Also, children from parents who have unhappy marriages are just as flawed because they have to witness constant fighting.  


I don't think most people are out there making vows they don't mean.  I think they mean the vows, but what we want changes over time.  Sometimes that means people make pivotal changes in their lives, big changes.

  
I think when someone chooses to leave their marriage, it's brave.  Most of us are afraid of change, and divorce is  difficult and stressful and oftentimes drags on.  No one would choose to do it without giving it some deep thought first."
Divorce,fdaqe6k,t1_fdamttq,1578248915.0,"I think people should leave a marriage if they want to.  For any reason they want.  Marriage is a choice....not an obligation.  Staying in a marriage for any other reason than that you want to be in the marriage is doing a disservice to everyone involved.  Why would you want to be married to someone who didn't want to be married to you?  Not all personal relationships are meant to last forever.  Just like not all friendships, jobs, or any other commitment last forever."

AskReddit,fb8xhvv,t3_ebzamg,1576624172.0,"I'm seeing a lot on here about women faking pleasure and laying during sex without moving like starfish.  Something that sounds like what someone would do if they had negative sexual experiences in the past like rape and sexual abuse where your personal autonomy and agency are not in your control anymore and it doesn't matter what you do or what you want.


I'm not saying it's an excuse...I'm just saying that I would go about this problem in a supportive way.  Like, say to the woman that you want to explore sex with her on equal footing, and get curious together and try things that especially she is interested in."
