I'm confused as to why people are upset over that (especially in this particular sub). No one's saying everyone has to pay as much as you do to get good childcare.

The last time I did one of my five-book TC checkouts from the library was when the Ted Bundy Tapes thing premiered on Netflix (almost exactly a year ago, I think. I remember because I was in Rome and reading about Ted Bundy every night, lol).

And yes, there's something fascinating about people whose mindsets are so, so far removed from our own that it's hard to believe we're the same species. How does a brain go so incredibly wrong, but in a way that makes someone become a rampant killer? Why murder, why not die-hard botany? Or, more worryingly, is there actually nothing technically wrong with their brains?

Yeah, good idea to take a step back for awhile and read up on less unsettling things."

ChoosingBeggars,ffq4e43,t1_ffpjlwn,1580119828.0,"Definitely not defending the ""employer"" here, as her post is a joke in the real world. This is obviously a totally unrealistic ""opportunity""/an insult for a standard childcare worker like your friend. If such programs exist, it seems like her only legitimate option would be a homeless person (maybe someone who had to escape a bad domestic situation) who needs a place to sleep and can't find work due to lack of experience/home address.

I wonder if there are programs like that for the homeless, because it seems like the only way in which this could be a win/win. The homeless person gets some work experience, a place to sleep outside of a shelter, and a possible reference (it'd have to be a stepping stone kind of job, obviously, as no one can work their way up on $50/week), and the person who can only pay peanuts for childcare actually gets a sitter."

Alternately, you can make a pizza fort.

Jobwise, at least you've been a GM of a busy restaurant, which has to count for something. I've heard managers for places like Rite-Aid and CVS actually pay pretty well (and probably less CBs).

I guess people just care more about their pets than their kids...

The idea of looking after two brats for 40 (probably more) hours a week for $100 makes me want to cry for this poor babysitter; I'd be too ashamed to offer that too. No wonder the EP gets ""really mean"" comments every times she posts an ad, lol. But of course she learns nothing.

Something is seriously wrong with how much this guy fears the gay. If he's not closeted, which seems like the simplest answer(?), then he's got some serious, serious issues around homosexuality that either involve deep-seated hatred or irrational fear.
