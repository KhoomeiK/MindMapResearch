excel,ffgpted,t1_ffg8byv,1579911992.0,"u/CFAman has the correct answer. You can add a little more flexibility to it though.

* Add a blank sheet, name it First, put it as the first sheet
* Add another blank sheet, name it Last, put it as the last sheet.
* Add a summary sheet, place it so it is not between First and Last
* Use this formula: =AVERAGE('First:Last'!C4)

Fundamentally the same concept, except that using blank placeholder sheets lets you move sheets from in between First and Last to get different averages."

I don't know how to do this without a sample file. PQ uses the column names to append columns. It needs some type of guide to tell it what the columns are. That's what the sample file is for.

If the original files have the same name, with the same capitalization and spacing, the columns will be appended correctly.

The only other way I can think of doing this is to name the sample files V1 through V100 (go up to the max column count), import everything then merge the columns you need to go together. I think this is more work though."
