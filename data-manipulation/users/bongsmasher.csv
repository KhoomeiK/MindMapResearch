Focus on taking care of yourself and dad/siblings.  This is a shitty period in your life.. which you will eventually get through! So know this is not permanent, even though it hurts a lot.   Do you have any hobbies or things you can do to get out of your own head ?  Good luck, you can do it."

dryalcoholics,ffqxcy7,t1_ffqwk68,1580145773.0,"I feel ya, it's definitely a slippery slope.  For instance,  i take maybe .25 mg of klonopin 3 to 4 times a week.  It keeps the anxiety at bay and I know its not the best for my health and long term use but for me it beats the horrible panic attacks and really improves my quality of life.  As you probably know, exercise, diet, all help but sometimes our chemicals in the brain are all sorts of fucked and we need extra help!  Are you just on sereoquel ? Take baby steps for going out side,  go get lunch in a public place, listen to music while your doing it.   Talk to the cashier, try to get out of your head.     If you haven't tried yet I also suggest Kava, Lemon Balm,  Valerian Root.  They all helped when I was trying to go the natural route.   Oh and HIGH CBD flower/tincture.  I couldn't smoke weed with high THC anymore cause it would start a full blown panic attack but i've found some strains that are very high cbd and low THC and they help a lot!!    <3"

cripplingalcoholism,ffqkj0l,t3_eum2jd,1580137087.0,"I was on probation for DUI in 2010 (Don't worry, I learned my lesson and have never drove drunk again!)  I had already had a test come back inconclusive because I had drank too much water before hand?  Either way, I wanted to pass this time.  I woke up that morning and had my usual coffee and drank a shit load of water.  When I get there I can't pee; if you didn't know, they stand in the room with you and stare.

The guy tell's me I have to piss today or I am going to jail because the last test didn't read.  So I drink some more coffee and water and wait for 10 minutes. I go back in, nervously I start pushing to piss.  I got to piss. I can't leave until I piss.  Well, after the last push I heard the horrible sound of shit coming out my ass.   He heard it too.   I looked at him and said ""Will that do?""  ""No Sir"" he says, we need piss.

I go out and find a bathroom,  throw away my underwear and try to clean myself up the best I can.  I clean up and go back in, finally I am able to piss in the cup.   I get a call two days later saying there is a warrant out for my arrest because my piss came up dirty.  I did blow 4 days before... I was told it be out in 24 hours!!!  So yeah, I shit my pants and still had to go to jail.   Ahhh what it was like to be young."
