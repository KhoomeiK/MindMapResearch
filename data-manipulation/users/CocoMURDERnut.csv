Though Awakening can happen in an seemingly infinite number of ways, its just that there are certain practices which do help with the process of it. 

You can call it 'Be Present,' another way to put it is a relentless awareness. 
Awareness situates within the present. 
So learning to be present, situates you within that awareness. 

 Martial Arts heavily intwines these concepts, since being in the moment is vital for fighting one on one. Entertaining thoughts, feelings can litterally deride you, and suddenly you have a fist impacting your face. 

Training with weapons can have much more dire effects of course with that deriding. 

With that said, the first time I was able to be present, without the echos of thoughts, and constructs severely manipulating... 
 
I cried tears of Joy, to realize I was fully present. 
 
Since for nearly 15 years I had been absolutely steamrolled by the constant layers of imagination interpreting my reality, and me taking such things so utterly seriously. 
(This is still a problem of course, just not as prevalent since the work was put in. Just adding that out of honesty.)

It was stupidly blissful, it still is in its own way. Since even now I'll be overloaded, then something stupidly simple happens that just returns to me  to a state of relative emptiness. Where it feels like it's my soul staring, and looking from my eyes, instead of my 'I.'

I pretty much reached this state accidentally. Not knowing what I was looking for. Though I knew it wasn't no accident either after the fact. :)

Theres a reason they say it's like 'Waking up' since dreams are constructs as well, The imagination creates constructs that overlay your sense of reality.  You could say being 'Present' is basically a Zero'ed out state. Where sensory information is just seen as information, purely & the contrast of the information is observed, instead of relating an 'I' to it. 

'Being Present' is technically what it is, it helps to be aware though that many perceptions and beliefs have severely inflated that wording making it nonsensical at times. 
The same way 'Awakening,' 'Enlightenment,' 'Ego,' & 'Spirtuallity,' are bloated in meaning. Not making them very good words to use in a technical sense.

Anticonsumption,fd0tvw9,t1_fd07sqx,1578123693.0,"It's not just Walmart either.
Many niche stores have become chain like, to the point you only are starting to see corporate branded stores in  so many goddamn areas. At least on the eastern side of the US. 

Corporate takeovers & expansion, has definitely hurt small businesses, and continually so.  

It makes me super sad, I fucking travel and find stretches of road, and lots that are identical to each other with similar brands plastered up & down. 

Ive seen this from NJ to Florida, it kills all sense of uniqueness.
 For such large areas of land to be used for these megastores is also a tragedy in itself. Especially in South Florida."

I love computational technology, but not when we are litterally hurting ourselves(life in general) to extract it. 

Even when it comes to Windmills, solar panels, and electric cars we are still leaving scars on the earth to produce them. 

Maybe when we can finally make base materials from readily, plentifully available sources that don't scar us... 

We can finally relax, and let our technology truly integrate with the nature around us, so they have a symbiotic relationship. Instead of a parasitic one."

Helper delivers the packages, while the driver gets the packages for the next stop ready.  It also leaves enough time to wait a second at someone's door to see if they're there, & time to be a little more delicate with the packages. 

Not every delivery route needs a helper of course, but for more densely populated areas, I think it makes sense to make it a full-time position.
 I'm sure they do have them limitedly in certain areas, but not like it should probably be. 

Not like these companies actually wanna be efficient, for whatever reason, seemingly at least."
