socialskills,ffayx1c,t3_es7zst,1579747710.0,"Listen man, I don't know you or what you look like but here's the thing...as a man I'd say about a 1/3rd of your attractiveness to a woman is based on looks. Bear with me. If you perceive yourself as ugly (which you very well may be) you're not doing yourself any favors on the other 2/3rds. 

For women, looks are about 90% of the equation I'd say. Men are turned on by looks, women are turned on by a multitude of things. In any event what you have to realize about the 33% for men is you can very easily boost your physical appearance. These things are totally controllable. I'd honestly be willing to say that any guy out there can influence their looks 2-3 points on a scale of 1-10. 

The first and most important thing to do is to dial in your fitness. Do yourself a favor and listen to David Goggins Joe Rogan podcast. This gives you the type of mindset you need to have from a guy that went from 340 lbs to a Navy Seal. The second I finished it I started running two a days - the gym in the morning with a lifting routine & hot yoga at night. You'd be amazed at the results I saw in the first three months alone. I quit drinking and commited myself fully to a clean diet & being a god damn savage, and if you really want it you have to do the same..

The second thing to do once you have your fitness dialed in is dress like you know what the eff you're doing. Half of style is being fit, the other is knowing how to not dress like a jabronie. MOst guys have no idea how to dress themselves; they wear clothes that don't fit, they wear things that are too flashy. Being fit & having a sense of style signals that you take care of yourself & those are two big pillars of physical attraction. My recommendation and who I learned from over time was twitter user: wellbuiltstyle. This dude is legit.

Now that we've talked about how to make yourself physically attractive - we also need to be real with ourselves. What are your expectations? Are you dissapointed because *no girls* give you attention? Or are you looking at instagram all day and wishing you'd be good looking enough to get with instagram models? It's okay to strive for the best, you very well may deserve it. And part of life is pushing for it and ridding yourself of your self limiting beliefs. But the other part is knowing to temper your expectations. If you can do that then I think slowly you will start to see yourself change, mentally, physically & from an attraction standpoint.

I can tell you from personal experience I've never had more girls give me the look or straight up approach me than I have in these past 2 months. The problem is mentally I'm a mess & haven't been in the best position to take advantage of it. Being physically attractive isn't everything man, alot of that shit is superficial. But being in shape and dressing well can never hurt you. Have some pride in taking care of yourself and people will take notice, but more importantly change the way you think about & carry yourself.

Cheers."

selfimprovement,fedma13,t3_eomaxq,1579015001.0,"Ditto man, except I'm 28, when I was your age I don't think I realized how anxious and irregular my thought patterns / depression were. The only thing you can do is keep going. I swing from hopelessness to optimism about improving every once in awhile but my anxiety / depression make it difficult to make any meaningful progress. 

I seem to have a blank mind, (outside of the anxiousness) almost nothing to say / contribute. It has gotten progressively worse for me as I used to be charismatic & humorous. Just know you're not alone but you are responsible for your well being. The worst thing you can do is give up on yourself."

NoFap,fdxwxes,t1_fdwv9nl,1578773781.0,"And how long does that take in your opinion? I don't disagree with the fact that porn re-wires your brain to constantly search for sex, but I'm curious about others takes on this. We are naturally sexual creatures. 

Is it 180 days? 90 days? Either way I think the goal is to unfuck our brains and never go back, but ideally long term system built IMO is: hard mode (rebaseline your brain to normalcy / being a loving and intimate person again) > tame your sexual energy to become a more productive contribution member of society > find someone to fufill your sexual / connection needs."
NoFap,fd2d1ue,t1_fd0iqg6,1578145457.0,"Haha this chick sounds like a trash can. She told you on a call that she thinks you're a 2/10? And you want to get better so she'll accept you?

The best thing you can take from this situation is the drive to better yourself, but not for her. Not for her approval, because a man worth fighting for has boundaries and doesn't encourage when people (especially women) disrespect him. I forget where I read this but the punch line was: behind every successful man is a woman that rejected him.

Also, I can tell you from personal experience you're placing too high a value on sex & as a result the acceptance of others. This is a natural thing to do when all your 19 year old friends that don't yet have any other aspirations in life are 100% invested in kissing girls and sex. But you're missing the Forrest for the trees. Invest your time in a hobby or skill and in the long run you'll become the interesting guy that girls are naturally attracted to. 

The easiest thing to do is to group think and get stuck in the mindset of ""I'm a kissless virgin"", but I beg of you, don't think like the masses. Most people, and almost all 19 year olds have no idea what life is really like. You are just starting out to build your perspectives and develop the lense for which you will view your future. I emplore you to not let it get clouded by the only thing in your sight at the moment (sex/being a virgin) because if you let it consume you, it will."
NoFap,fcz9bvn,t3_ejipo9,1578096287.0,I'm interested in this because I only just started and I feel that the reason I rely on porn is due to low self esteem & lack of believing in myself. I don't think this will solve my issues but wondering if it will help
selfimprovement,fcvtf29,t3_ej44m4,1578009693.0,"Taken from an article I read via twitter:

There’s a concept in economics called sunk cost.

From Wikipedia:

“In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered.”

This applies to life as well.

Have you ever seen someone being sad and depressed over something bad that happened in the past (usually long ago)? I’m sure you have.

I’m saying you shouldn’t be.

Regret is a wasted emotion.

Total waste.

The past is already gone. The cost has been incurred. It cannot be recovered.

(If it can be fixed, then don’t waste time being sad, go ahead and do it.)

Maybe you made a mistake. Maybe you made a bad decision, but that’s happened already.

You have no way to undo it.

The only thing you get by excessively focusing on your past is sadness, self-doubt, and depression.

Sure, you SHOULD fix what you can fix about what has happened, but what you cannot fix has to be accepted as it is. Doing this is a major key to happiness.

Let me end this with an example:

Say I give you a $100. On day one, you lose $50.

Day two, you’re sad that you were once a guy with $100 and now you only have $50. That’s the wrong way of thinking. What’s the point of crying now?

On day two, you’re actually just a guy with 50 bucks, not someone who lost 50 yesterday. This is because that’s the current situation you’re in NOW. That is all that matters.

You can only make decisions based on how your present resources can impact your future, not how your past resources can.

Your past, therefore, is irrelevant."
