grunge,ffudt49,t3_ev6p4y,1580239857.0,"It was like this for me, but with radio rock and Electric Wizard. Before discovering them, my musical tastes were whatever I had on a CD and whatever came on my local rock/alternative radio (of course, ""alt-rock"" refers to Disturbed, Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, Coldplay, Chevelle, Tool, System of a Down, Offspring, Three Days Grace, Green Day, Jimmy Eat World, etc., and apparently Metallica and Guns n Roses also qualify as alternative rock). Nirvana was obviously a part of that, but I never really ""got"" them beyond blankly accepting that they were one of the great musical bands of the 20th century. Then I discovered Electric Wizard and had my mind blown for reasons that are too irrelevant to get into.

For example, before Electric Wizard: Butthole Surfers are the guys who ripped off Beck because they don't mind the sun sometimes. After Electric Wizard: ""*Locust Abortion Technician* is peak 80s alternative rock.""

From El Wiz, rather than just wallowing in ultra-heavy metal, I actually went to classic rock, old-school blues and jazz and krautrock and proto-metal and older punk and found my way back to Sub Pop-era grunge and, as a result, got back into Nirvana and their cohorts in a way I never had before when my musical limits of them was entirely Smells Like Teen Spirit, Rape Me, Come As You Are, In Bloom, All Apologies, and the few songs I got off iTunes like Tourettes, Breed, and Negative Creep (which I thought was a *thrash* metal song until I learned that sludge metal and noise rock exists—I don't cringe at it or when others make the same mistake because I didn't know these genres existed and was just making a deduction based off what I knew at the time). I mean, I'm no Nirvana expert— I love Kurt's work with *Fecal Matter* and those times he helped out with *Earth*, but you'd stump me if you asked about what else he or the others did beyond that (I know they had some no-name drummer that may or may not have formed a small little rock band, and there was another that dealt with bacteria). 

But listening to Nirvana became an entirely different experience than how it was before 2010. I actually ""got"" what they were trying to do and it makes me kinda sad that so many don't get it. They don't know what it means."

worldnews,ffpi8qz,t3_eugyir,1580095678.0,"Absolutely true. I saw this happen with a forum I absolutely loved back in 2014 with ebola. It was *sickening*. There was a pretty healthy mix of political ideologies, with some far-leftists and a couple far-rightists thrown in, but it was civil and everything remained on topic. 

Then 2014 happened. The whole thing with Trayvon Martin was probably the ""real"" start, but ebola was when it spiraled wildly and catastrophically out of control. 

There was this set of conspiracy theories being pushed: Obama opened the USA to Africa to allow ebola patients in and get white Americans infected as revenge for slavery. Bill and Melinda Gates were responsible for the spread of ebola as a means of population control (care to comment about your actual nefarious plans, /u/thisisbillgates?) 

One guy even outright said that it was a *good* thing that ebola was doing ""a little depopulation"" in Africa but it should be stopped from entering Europe and America. Gee, curious way to put it. Is that a discarded mask I see on the floor?

That forum got eviscerated by political pissmatching and was shut down back in 2018 because of how toxic it had become. In fact, it got shut down so hard that the archives of it were also shut down just last month, so outside the Wayback Machine, there's *no way to even prove this forum ever existed*. Hundreds of thousands of discussion: gone like that, with only scant evidence of them left. Maybe 1% at most.

The forum in question being the KurzweilAI forums, which were once the MindX forums— which dated back to the 1990s. A two-decade-old futurist forum, killed by paranoia wrought by a disease. Paranoia that said that Obama was trying to kill all whites with a relatively rare disease that almost totally affected blacks in a backwater part of Africa, which burned out after infecting 30,000 people, which could only really be spread by handling another person's internal fluids. That's what did it.

People have this erroneous belief that nuclear winter is caused by the bombs themselves. The particles that block out the sun would actually come from the burning cities and towns, with an almost infinitesimal amount coming from the vapors and debris of the explosions themselves.

If we wanted to cause a winter, we'd have to spend years building city-sized constructs just to be destroyed. 

And even then, there'd have to be a *lot* of them. Otherwise, you'd risk doing the reverse: pumping a lot of polluting materials into the atmosphere but not in large enough numbers to actually block solar radiation; instead, it's enough to act as an accelerant for the greenhouse effect. 

The amount of effort needed to actually cause a global winter would basically require us to spend half of our global GDP just to do it. At that point, it'd just be more prudent to develop carbon capture, renewable/nuclear energy, and, if push comes to shove, find some volcanoes.

I'm largely back on that train, but now for a different reason.

Nickelback isn't the worst band ever by far; what they are is one of the smartest. They've mastered the art of making comfort food, middle-of-the-road hard rock that offends absolutely no one and tries its best to come off as hard, edgy, and exciting but is ultimately meant for soccer moms who are so paranoid about their children that the edgiest thing they allow in their house is Sonic the Hedgehog. That and football-loving dads who don't think too much about music beyond the radio and will blast any generic D-tuned post-grunge/alt-metal track that *sounds* heavy. It doesn't make you think at all. All the songs are pretty much at the same tempo. Many of them follow the same chord progression. There isn't anything exciting going on in the music either; not many memorable riffs, few instrumental or vocal solos, not many shifts, nothing. 

If you heard it on the radio, you probably wouldn't change the station in visceral disgust as if they started playing BrokeNCYDE. You might even start singing along for a verse. But you'd forget that it ever played within 20 minutes.

They came at a time when Creed had already mastered comfort-food post-grunge but started to seriously bow out, so they picked up the slack. I mean, think: what cultural impact has Creed left? They sold something like 50 million records and were basically the largest rock band on Earth for several years, and yet it feels like you could've completely erased them from history and nothing would've changed (well, speaking from experience, all that 2000s Christian rock & pseudo-Christian rock wouldn't have had a basic sound to latch onto, so I guess that counts). 

Nickelback did the same thing, but maintained that popularity for much longer. At one point in time, they were just another post-grunge band in a long line of them, but their perfection of making mediocre radio rock kept them in the spotlight, especially when they were bandied about as the face of rock music in the mainstream. Rock fans ever since the '70s had always had a bit of disdain at best for mainstream rock bands (to play devil's advocate: look at where that crab mentality brought rock music), but the late '90s/early '00s are still considered a general nadir of the genre by most except fans of these particular styles that were popular at the time (the aforementioned post-grunge as well as nü metal and earlier mainstream emo).

In a time when rock music was already starting to go off the rails straight into ""angsty joyless middle-class white kid music"" (this goes for hard rock, indie rock, emo, and alternative of the 2000s alike), Nickelback was like eating flour. Basically everything wrong with rock music of the time: burly vocalist with little charisma, lyrics that try to sound deep & personal but don't really say anything, musicality that wants to sound influenced by classic rock, metal, and/or grunge but is restained and kept completely safe, verse-chorus-verse structure that is so mechanical that even a slight deviation gets a song labeled as ""surprisingly good"", same dull downtuned guitar tone as just about all other modern rock, and all around nothing even very ""stylistic"" about them either. Even 80s butt rockers at least had *some* semblance of style that made them feel ""80s as fuck"". 2000s butt rock is defined by how hard it goes out of its way to be forgettable, down-to-earth, styleless, and grounded ""I can share a beer with these guys"". It's the strangest quirk about the 2000s in general, that there was almost this push to *not* have a defining aesthetic or style, and that's somehow become the 2000s' defining style. Considering we got the likes of emo, crunk, pimp culture, and the big wave of indie-hipsterdom, it's the ""generic metro-haired average guy"" that I think of when I try to envision what style best describes the 2000s. Emo comes close, but it's just too stylized for the 2000s.

Nickelback sounds like what the 2000s were."

If you want to make a perfect album, I'd say all you have to do is swap just a few songs from Superunknown onto Badmotorfinger to make it 16 or 17-songs.

Chiefly Mailman, Superunknown, 4th of July, and Like Suicide. Actually, Like Suicide can completely replace New Damage; it's a vastly superior ""end of album"" song, possibly one of the best of the decade. New Damage is okay, but I've never liked it that much honestly. I've also never really enjoyed Drawing Flies; I'd say you could replace it with Kickstand but only if that closing Sabbathy riff were the entire song (make it totally Sabbath punk basically), so that one's up in the air. 

Either way, I agree, Badmotorfinger's much more of a banger. It's fundamentally a heavy metal album, which is why. By 1991, ""heavy metal"" was largely dust in the wind, trampled by speed metal, power metal, thrash metal, glam metal, and the newer styles of groove metal and death metal. There were loads of straight ""heavy metal"" (I'll just go with heavy-metal) bands, but most of them sounded like discount Iron Maidens or borderline glam without the glam. Soundgarden did it right, in a way similar to Motörhead and Diamond Head, but with a shitload of punk thrown in. In fact, I know this is the case because when heavy-metal bands also did it right (at the time, circa 1989-1993), they tended to sound surprisingly similar to Soundgarden. My favorite example being Holocaust's *Hypnosis of Birds* [which very well could have been a Louder Than Love B-sides with another (inferior) vocalist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LytJhuLuPlY)

If the races of Middle Earth were instead referred to as species, it might not be as hard of a sell nowadays. You see, we Sapiens got lucky that we're the only extant hominoid species. Therefore, we're only used to our species-typical behaviors and capabilities. Racism was built off of trying desperately to defend behavioral & physical minutia to justify slavery and colonialism, sans any consideration for differences in culture, diet, and circumstances (think of how Native Americans constructed such grand civilizations, but the vast majority were weakened or fell away before European arrival, and they were all retarded by the lack of a horse or mule-like transportation creature which would have facilitated a practical wheel; racists simplify that to Natives are inferior biologically).

The problem with relating Tolkien's work to real life here is that the different races actually *are* different biologically and behaviorally. And like I said, we got lucky with this. Imagine if most extinct hominins persisted to the present day. If Sapiens had to share a world with Neanderthalensis, Erectus, Floresiensis, Naledi, Luzonensis, Habilis, as well as the Australopithecines and Paranthropus. That sounds like paleoanthropological heaven to me, but from a social and racial historical basis... hoo boy. Because there *are* differences in the biology (and very likely behavior) of Sapiens vs Habilis, but both are humans. Erectus would probably be indistinguishable from a shorter, leaner Sapiens, but morphologically might resemble an African or Melanesian. Sort of like a pygmy. Except now factor in the fact the Erectuses would have much smaller brains and probably more ""primitive"" behavior, one which absolutely cannot be chalked up to historical oppression, differences in diet and consumption, or circumstances of history. Racists & colonialists would've had no trouble slagging off every brown & black-skinned Sapiens as an Erectus in hiding.

That's how I usually imagine Tolkien's world nowadays. It helps that Middle Earth is supposed to be Earth from another, far more ancient age canonically."

> Foundational futurism is the reason why the 2000s and early parts of the 2010s felt so uneventful and even boring despite the fact we saw the rise of so much stuff that'll prove undoubtedly influential going forward. Things like noninvasive and invasive brain scanners, graphene, deep learning, CRISPR, practical virtual reality, and so on, all coming alongside things like P2P networks and virtual payments & cryptocurrency. It's sort of like the 1920s into the 1930s for technology, where new innovations happened in sci-tech, physics, and medicine but so much of it wasn't reaching the average person just yet and a lot was really experimental. Penicillin, aerojets, television, radio, analog & digital computing, and so on. These certainly existed in the 1930s, but they didn't really rise to prominence until after World War 2. So a futurist in 1940 would've been frustrated that all the amazing stuff that came between 1880 and 1920 seemed to have petered out. Where was the electricity, the bottled light, the automobile, the aeroplane, the telephone, the radio, the theatre, the nuclear physics, the grand explorations into and discoveries from the primeval parts of the world, more tasty fruits of industrialism of his generation? It seemed to him that everyone just stopped caring about the future and grand technologies in lieu of reloading their guns for another pointless war. It seemed like technology stopped moving forward and everyone was just refining what came before.

> Then, of course, starting around 1943, 1944 or so, we start really seeing a sudden lurch upwards as the second post-industrial S curve kicks in. Transistors, mass media, television, space flight, microwaves, lasers, youth culture, miniaturization, air conditioning, a new wave of medicine, and so much more just explodes between 1945 to 1990 culminating in things like (and especially) the Internet.

Of course, it's wuxia-inspired through Dragon Ball, so naturally it's nothing like the more actualized material coming out these days.
 
When it comes to Dragon Ball being wuxia/wuxia-inspired (I personally say it's a parody of wuxia, not unlike *Spaceballs* being a parody of *Star Wars* and space operas or *Blazing Saddles* being a parody of the Western), I'm actually looking less at *Journey to the West* and more the various wuxia & kung fu Hong Kong movies Toriyama was known to watch that inspired it. Things like Drunken Master, Child of Peach, Zu: Warriors from Magic Mountain, One-Armed Boxer, things like that. 

From what I've ascertained by reading his interviews, Dragon Ball is based on *JttW* more to give readers a familiar sense of what's going on. Sort of like if I wanted to make a cartoon parodying European fantasy, I'd probably base it on Arthurian legend or Tolkienesque fantasy. The stuff that *actually* inspired Dragon Ball on a thematic level was more the Shaw Brothers & Golden Harvest movies of the '60s and '70s.

It's become something of a joke, that *Dragon Ball* is a series Toriyama wrote as a loveletter to those movies entirely because he wanted some smokes, and just to make it easier on himself and because every Japanese person knew the story, he used *JttW* as a template."

Target demographic being middle class Caucasians who then believe the music is hyper inclusive for all marginalized communities.  When rock split from black music (and worse, was *celebrated* for doing so), that was one of the beginnings of the end.

It's also due to waveforms. A lot of music advertised as ""rock"" today is abrasive, and indeed, bands marketed as ""rock"" (such as emo, post-hardcore, metalcore, and stoner metal bands) are objectively heavier than metal bands of the '70s and often '80s. Most pop isn't that extreme. The most popular hard rock songs weren't that extreme. Even pop punk had some fun, catchy beats to it that made it radio friendly. 

And since the dominant style of rock that isn't as heavy (indie rock) comes off as ""music for geeky upper-middle class beta-male white people and wannabe-white people with social anxiety whose primary mode of humor is self-deprecation, irony, meta, and pop culture references and who think ballscratcher riffs are enough to rock out,"" it's really a question why people think rock *should* come back.

The fact Greta van Fleet and King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are so welcomed by Zoomers ought to be evidence that doing it *right* is timeless advice. Youths would love for rock to come back.

Again, to give benefit of the doubt, it *is* very broad. Every time I try to discuss synthetic media and its effects, I get *overwhelmed*. There's ***so*** much that's possible, and there's ***so*** much you'd have to cover to get a really good feel for what's possible that it's a bit much.

In that time, ""deepfakes"" has started to be used as a shorthand for other types of media synthesis, which would've been a good development before then since it's a less technical-sounding word. But I'm running with it. 


Indeed, the ultimate intention is to get 'media synthesis' as a full category, including a categorical box that'll go at the bottom of the page for the likes of deepfakes and Music & Artificial Intelligence and human image synthesis and whatnot.

Deepfakes *work* by having models that can reliably detect them. That's the function of generative-adversarial networks. One model generates media; another model finds flaws in it.

MarkMyWords,fedn35v,t1_fed3oqv,1579015536.0,"Hoo boy, it's a bit complicated.

1. Get more ""rock"" bands. Not hard rock bands; just ""rock and roll."" Hard rock, metal, and punk fans might not initially like them because they aren't heavy enough, but I think it's necessary. Something Stones & Kinks-esque at least, perhaps Pearl Jam-esque even (but without the Vedder clone or the relentless downtuned guitars of post-grunge/butt rock). This also means that these bands shouldn't be afraid of injecting funk and rhythm; indeed, ""rhythm and blues"" used to refer to a style very close to rock back in the day before R&B became more associated with what I can also call ""glam-rap without the rap"" back in the 2000s. There are things that people, as humans, just like. Rock artists never really try getting into a groove anymore (and groove metal definitely doesn't count). Many of the bigger bands pride themselves on the fact you *can't* dance to them; just mosh at best. 

2. It has to have some sense of ""masculinity"" to it. This is hard to explain, but there was a comment I read a while ago that went over that a lot of the more adored rock bands of the past 60 years were so because of this sense that they represented present masculinity in some form; the reason why the Beatles were taken seriously by boys while still being a girl's band but One Direction (who is objectively no worse than the Beatles circa 1963-1965) was basically every young male's most hated enemy for a while. This is obviously hard to pull off because the rock bands that are known for masculinity are entirely the likes of extreme metal and hardcore punk (and masculinity has changed as well). Masculinity also doesn't necessarily = men alone; it's more about presentation and style. Indie rock is seen as effeminate for a lot of reason, and part of that does come down to a lack of desire to project a powerful voice (think of how many indie rocker vocalists have a style best described as either perishing, nerdy, nasally, Chris Martin/Thom Yorke-esque, or faux-soul; when they're women, the trend has been towards this very vulnerable & weak raspy waif sound, a very far cry from the much more powerful soul of, say, Janis Joplin or even Alanis Morisette). So even though indie rock is probably where the ""sound"" will come from, it definitely won't be where the aesthetic or spirit comes from. 

3. More fun lyricism. This would apply to a poppier variant (all of this does, what am I talking about?) 2000s rock fell apart because so many bands adopted a cynical self-hatred stance, one that aggressively presented themselves as down-to-earth and broken people rather than rock stars. Whenever lyrics did get ""fun,"" it was usually the same old rock cliches anyway, but they are cliches for a reason. People think that we need a new Nirvana, someone to bring ""real"" meaningful lyrics back to rock. While I agree (Nirvana was the Billie Eilish of their day, and that's not even a wrong comparison), I hate to say it and burst the bubble, but where have you been and what have you been listening to for the past 30 years that makes you think angst, weakness, and frustrastion *hasn't* been the default for major rock bands?? It has to be more varied than that! Nirvana and their ilk was a breath of fresh air from the vapid pseudo-angst of acoustic hair-metal ballads, but that was coming off of a tradition of escapist chauvinistic rock lyrics anyway, but in a poppy enough way that it completely smacked the hairspray farmers rather than something as fucked up sounding as, say, Buzzoven or Ox Bow.

4. Follow pop trends. This might be the hardest to ""get"" because rock fans, like jazz fans before them, have embraced turning away from pop. My opinion is that you don't need to be half-trap in your music and use autotune; just be young and do the things of the young. Regularly use TikTok for example. Be active on social media and whatnot. Know which new social media sites kids are flocking to. And, again I stress, try not to be over roughly 22 years old. So many rock bands I see look like they're fronted by people's moms and dads, except with tons of tattoos and occasionally edgy haircuts.

There's still more, but this is getting overlong. The point is that there's a very wide range of things you have to do. Most of them, rock fans and budding rock artists are unwilling to do over cultural issues. Rock culture was born in the Westerns & biker culture of the '60s and '70s (as well as the DIY punk ethos of the late '70s and '80s), and many artists say being analog, opposed to big trends, and closer to that style is where rock music is best, and I don't even think they're wrong. It's simply a messy state of affairs. And I also think that, even if you did everything right, it still might not go perfectly for you. The Telecommunications Act of '96 screwed a lot of popular music up; if an automated DJ doesn't already have you on selection possibly months in advance, you're just not going anywhere.

Likewise, you could be memed to the top if there was a coordinated effort, but that won't be sustainable either unless it was a regular thing, and that could be hijacked so easily by trolls."

MarkMyWords,fedk4wg,t1_fedc4xj,1579013546.0,"Grunge killed hair metal by way of replacing it. Pop trends are that fickle, and since hair metal was entirely manufactured for MTV (not unlike nü metal over a decade later, which also evaporated when a new sound came in), any new trend was going to take it out.

Hair metal killed hair metal by way of being like Atari games circa 1982. Clearly it was silly shit that got old after MTV started finding its feet and people's taste started shifting. Though I also reckon that a big reason why it did so poorly with hard rock and metal fans is because it was called 'hair metal.' 

In fact, going back to nü metal for a second, I think that both of these genres were not really ""metal"" music and calling them ""metal"" did more harm than good. Casual pop and softer rock fans would see Poison and Limp Bizkit and think ""hey, heavy metal guys!"", listen to them, and think that's what metal is. Metal fans would listen to them and despise everything to do with them, mostly because they're considered metal in the mainstream (they're inoffensive otherwise). Metal critics use them to lambast metal as a whole.

It can't be extreme metal because then it wouldn't work for obvious reasons, but you could arguably repackage proto-metal & First Wave of Heavy Metal (e.g. 1969 to 1976 material) and maybe bits and pieces of the less-Maideny New Wave of British Heavy Metal (1977 to 1983 material) as just ""heavy rock"". Smash it against stoner/doom rock and get something going there. Audiences will think ""it's just rock, it's fine,"" while metalheads would go, ""wait a second, this is so clearly heavy metal."" And it also wouldn't step on the toes of extreme metal since there's no way to get a band that sounds like early Diamond Head to be taken seriously as heavy metal in today's rock market; everyone would just immediately be comparing them to extreme metal/metalcore/deathcore acts.

Gah, it's all so complicated nowadays!"
MarkMyWords,fedjpsq,t1_fedgaxp,1579013251.0,"Not really.

I realized this when opening these songs in Audacity compared to songs from older rock bands, and then compared the waveforms to things like grinding metal in a factory. Extreme metal and hardcore punk were almost indistinguishable from machining metal (perhaps unsurprisingly on the former); they're saved by their musicality. 

What people have to realize is that *this sounds abrasive to most people.* I can attest to this myself, that it took me a damn long time to really ""hear"" metal from an outsider's perspective. There's a reason it'll never be truly mainstream.

Even when you look at foreign hard rock and metal bands, it's rarely the extreme ones that chart; it's usually straight hard rock groups (think the Hellacopters) or a group that's halfway to being a meme (like BABYMETAL). When a harder band does cross over into the mainstream, that tends to be rare and serves more to fill a niche.

There'd have to be a *massive* campaign to get these genres to the top, and even then there's no guarantee it'd work because, again, it really all comes down to them being abrasive by nature."
MarkMyWords,feckrsb,t1_feckhj7,1578976330.0,"I was going to say, that's King Gizzard. They've made a lot of waves recently.

But I was also going to say that Australia's probably close to not even counting. As far as I'm aware, they've been doing the whole heavy rock/guitar R&B/dirty blues consistently since the 1960s.

[Here's a good one from the grunge era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WgBqoXde5I). Just par for the course for Aussie rock."
MarkMyWords,fecbnvm,t1_febkku6,1578970250.0,I never said they're not rock. Just the opposite. I said that they're old. QotSA is two decades old. Rock can't be kept alive by bands that are decades old. We need fresh blood.
MarkMyWords,febi98r,t1_febhoob,1578959113.0,"That's a good damn question, but I think a better question is ""what is a new guitar rock SCENE?"" Because a single band isn't enough to sustain things. If things were just a bit different, I'd say that the psyche/garage scene is it. But I can't call anything because who knows what'll happen."
MarkMyWords,febdwk1,t3_eob76m,1578957831.0,Maybe more like *Battlefield Earth*. It has to be good to look at first.
MarkMyWords,febbznk,t1_feb5h3b,1578957311.0,"> grunge killed hair metal, and furthermore, grunge only killed hair metal and that was in North America predominantly

As an aside, I realized recently that the myth about grunge killing metal bears a few uncanny similarities to the Great Video Game Crash of 1983. 

Popular misconception: everyone was listening to heavy metal up to 1991 until Nirvana came along and grunge tried (and failed) to kill the metal. Hair metal died, had short revivals here and there, and now rests in history, but heavy metal screamed back by 1998 or so (and in a form that wasn't angsty I Hate Mom music by 2004). Pantera and Metallica kept metal alive in the early 90s.

Reality: Rock fans in America and Britain were starkly divided on hair metal in the 1980s, and many wished it would go away in lieu of some return to '60s/'70s style heavy rock.  Grunge happened to be that scene, in America at least. Hair metal persisted up to about 1993 before being completely wiped out due to pop trends changing. The other heavy metal subgenres were either already past their peak or just getting started, so there was a period in metal between 1989 and 1992 where a lot of the underground stuff was changing hands; thrash metal had gone as far as it could go without devolving into self-parody or crossing over into death metal. Speaking of which, ***metal was completely fine outside of North America***. Also, grunge itself was essentially a punk-filtered return to the First Wave of Heavy Metal, at least on its more metallic side. This wasn't recognized at the time due to hair metal being the face of heavy metal music (and no one wanted to be associated with hair metal), and because hair metal was dead, ""all of metal has died."" Compare that to nowadays when loads of grunge bands are eager to embrace genres like sludge and stoner metal. But this was actually the start of metal's more experimental era in the underground, and it didn't really fade in Europe or Japan or South America either. So it was really just North American hair metal that died; North American thrash metal just happened to come to a halt by its own natural lifespan at the same time. 


See the similarities? I'm not going crazy am I?

Popular misconception: ET for the Atari 2600 killed video games and the video gaming industry was only saved by Nintendo and Super Mario Bros (with a little help from ROB the Robot). Between 1983 and 1986, video games were pretty much dead. 

Reality: Console video games in North America were overhyped with quality control issues, and this led to a crash that erased most of the market value here in the States. Atari was the big video game company, so them going under with few competitors to fill in the vacuum is what led to investors getting cold feet. 1983-1986 was, however, one of the golden ages of arcade games and home computer games in North America. What's more, the console market didn't crash elsewhere; it was developing just fine in Europe, South America, and Japan. Nintendo certainly saved the console industry in North America, but they didn't save video gaming. There was no ""death""."
