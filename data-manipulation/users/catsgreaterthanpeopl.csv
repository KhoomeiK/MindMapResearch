(Also, on a side note, can we start the movement where we celebrate women for their personalities and accomplishments yet? Who the fuck cares if you look like a goddess? Looks are fleeting, so even if you do look hot today, you won’t always.)"
fatlogic,ffnfytm,t3_ets22v,1580065399.0,Going gluten free does not make you skinny. In fact if you have actual celiacs & go gluten free you will probably gain weight since your body will actually be able to absorb calories and not shit everything out.
fatlogic,ffncwkx,t1_ffmeifm,1580064420.0,"I did 23 a couple years ago, and that explanation is much clearer than it used to be."
fatlogic,ffmdkpl,t3_ettwbh,1580052968.0,"I want to know if their definition of average is average size of people that have used their site, average weight of actual Americans, or if average means what people should weigh on average."
fatlogic,ff9jh87,t1_ff7171p,1579714320.0,"Definitely talk to your doctor about the iron levels if you think they are screwed up. Other vitamin deficiencies can cause lack of energy and reoccurring anemia can sometimes be caused by things that need medical attention. (If Aunt Flo is like the red tide, that’s probably it, but otherwise mention it to your doctor)."
fatlogic,ff9i4eb,t3_erw5oj,1579713508.0,"You can’t tell my health!!! Well after you mentioned you have issues with constipation, I kind of can. Most constipation can be related to low fiber intake. Low fiber intake is associated with higher rates of colon cancer and higher cholesterol. So enjoy your “healthy years”  because your choices eventually have consequences."
fatlogic,ff9g3b8,t3_es0ylw,1579712266.0,"If you have T2D then you aren’t going to have low blood sugar unless you take too much insulin (something that can easily happen if you aren’t counting carbs). More likely your blood sugar will just be too high all the time. And guess what? You aren’t going to feel high blood sugar until it’s so high that it is actively doing damage, potentially irreversible, to your body."
fatlogic,ff53gm2,t1_ff36dn7,1579579187.0,This person didn’t make it up. It’s a common FA term. There’s even an Instagram hashtag.

fatlogic,ff11hkh,t3_er2wwc,1579474326.0,"Is the Journal of Obesity an actual peer reviewed journal or some publication by far activists? 

I do agree with the poster above that it’s an unrealistic way to present weight loss. Hopefully they are going to try to teach more long term tools for success and maintenance to their contestants this round."
fatlogic,fezunlm,t3_er0ku3,1579461880.0,This person is so selfish that her stepdad got a life changing diagnosis and all she can do is think about herself.

fatlogic,fdhzdm4,t1_fdha4i8,1578432942.0,"The WHO last year published a recommended diet for health and carbon footprint. It’s still technically omnivorous, but only has tiny amounts of meat. It’s basically plant food based with very small amounts of animal products."
fatlogic,fcnoiqk,t1_fcnhom9,1577815414.0,"I would be less bothered by it myself if even 1/3 of them stuck with it. It’s like they all go for a week or two, get in my way, then disappear forever. I don’t consider it more people getting healthy, because you don’t get healthy working out once."
