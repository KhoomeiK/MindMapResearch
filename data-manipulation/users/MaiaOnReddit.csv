books,ffjkfe7,t1_ffjjsim,1580000254.0,"I've entered in the past and recieved everything I've won. One time I didn't receive a book. I told Goodreads and they contacted the author and they sent me another copy and it got to me.

Most giveaway wins take 4-6 weeks to arrive and all of mine that I just won were won no more than three weeks ago.

Honestly, you've just got to enter everything. I enter over 90% of all the print giveaways and that's when I start to win."
vegan,ffjibgm,t3_etz5dp,1579998849.0,"Don't do this to me! I'm craving something sweet and unhealthy right now and the only sweet thing I've got in the house right now is oranges and chocolate milk and I want neither. Lol

This looks so good!"
pointlesslygendered,ffjhuy7,t3_etz8fs,1579998549.0,"Yes! I used to work at Burger King. Sometimes we had ""gender neutral toys"" so I wouldn't have to ask, but when we had ""boy toys"" and ""girl toys"" I never used genders. You wouldn't believe how many little girls wanted transformers when we had those."
college,ffjfckc,t3_etyxlw,1579997065.0,"It could have been worse, but one semester we were made to have groups for a semester long project that was a big portion of our grade. However, we weren't allowed top pick the groups. I was put into one where we all had extremely conflicting schedules and the professor just didn't care. We're had to meet outside of class and we could almost never all make it because we just couldn't find a time where we could all be there. Someone always had to miss our and fall behind and lose points."
namenerds,ffirdiq,t3_er4fqa,1579980801.0,Andy IS a real name...for a boy.
namenerds,ffim30o,t1_ff8akan,1579977136.0,"It IS serious though. We're talking about hypothetical names for a REAL child. You're seriously considering names for real future children, so it is serious."
namenerds,ffilmx1,t3_es2q6t,1579976827.0,"I like some ""unisex"" names, but Levi isn't one. It's all boy to me and one of the few names that ends in an I that doesn't seem to have been taken over by girls yet.

I tend to like softer names on boys, but still could never picture them on girls. Just because a name is a bit softer doesn't mean that it should be automatically stolen by girls."
namenerds,ffikqrz,t3_es2t5h,1579976215.0,"I would pronounce Zepha/Zeffa and Zephyr differently.

Also, I personally wouldn't use either name, but Zepha sounds and looks like a girl's name to me while Zephyr sounds and looks like a boy's name to me."
namenerds,ffiklsv,t3_ervsac,1579976119.0,"Like...Bride-ee? I'm sorry, it's absolutely horrible."
namenerds,ffikiks,t3_ej2wuz,1579976055.0,Why are so man thg people praising these names? The two older kids' names are...fine. I think they'll be able to live with those names. But I feel so bad for your new baby. He's going to have to carry around a joke of a name for the rest of his life...unless he decides to change it to something that doesn't sound like his parents were high when they named him.
namenerds,ffik97g,t3_ettz42,1579975875.0,"I mean...it almost doesn't sound like a real name. It isn't horrible though, and I think all three middle names sound good with it."
Sims4,ffij843,t1_ffhw22z,1579975166.0,Yes
unpopularopinion,ffhw3yo,t3_etqc95,1579956568.0,Lots of people enjoy playing the sims 4. That's why they're still making packs for it. EA wants that money and they don't make things if they don't think they can make money off if it. People would stop buying it if they hated it.
houseplants,ffhqs5v,t3_etpb12,1579948959.0,"Sorry, not helpful but I had to share my spiral into insanity. 

I was so confused by what this picture was at first. My mind convinced me that the leaf was a badly burned arm, but it just looked so weird and I couldn't make sense of what I was looking at.  And then I realized. Lol."
vegan,ffhi9cr,t1_ffhhp07,1579936451.0,"Nothing. If they consent, it's vegan. But it is a bit gross. Can you imagine eating your grandma after she died? It feels weird and wrong. Also, as a society we have standards and etiquette rules and eating people is not okay by those rules. We try to show the dead respect with burial ceremonies."
vegetarian,ffhhlzn,t3_etncky,1579935607.0,"I eat soup a lot. Bread. Americanized Mexican food.

Honestly, anything that I ate before I can eat now just slightly changed to make it plant based."
Sims4,ffhh85a,t1_ffhh5t7,1579935121.0,"Slice of Life is extremely clean. No worse than the regular game.

Wicked Whims is R rated."
vegan,ffhh6ju,t1_ffhgy2j,1579935067.0,"In a normal setting, absolutely. As a last resort in a survival of the fittest situation, no. People do crazy things when they're desperate and those animal instincts kick in when you have no other choice. I don't really think you can blame someone for cannibalism if they've tried everything else to avoid it first.

The situation would have to be very extreme though."
Sims4,ffhh2dp,t3_etnav1,1579934925.0,"Wicked Whims is too...open for my tastes. But I do have Slice of Life and I enjoy it. Sims get periods. In my current household it lasts for two days and comes every twelve days. But, I've seen YouTubers play it and there times were different. It varies sim to sim, which is cool and accurate to real life.

You can also get sick, but can get the flu shot to mostly prevent it. You have to renew the flu shot, but it lasts several days. Different sims react differently to the shot and children mostly hate them, which is quite accurate to real life.

You can also get dehydrated from not drinking what, break out in pimples from bad hygiene or just those raging teenage hormones, self WooHoo (which is just as clean as the regular unmodded WooHoo in the game, and get bad breath from not brushing your teeth. There are also a few other features.

Read through the mod. Wat h a few playthroughs of it on YouTube. It's really quite fun."
vegan,ffhgrhh,t3_etnbcj,1579934552.0,"Veganism is about doing what you can as far as it's practical and possible.

Take this extreme situation as an example:

Cannibalism. It's horrible and completely immoral in a normal setting. Stranded somewhere with no other possibility for food? It suddenly becomes less immoral.

It's survival that's the key. Could you survive just add easily without that leather bag? Do you need it? Now it's an automatic no in our first world country setting. If I needed to to survive, I would. But I don't.  I have grocery stores filled with vegan options. (And I live in a small town. Our faux food products may be limited, but you don't need to eat those to be vegan.)

It's really kind of silly to go over these ""what if"" situations. What are the chances that it will happen to you? Why does it matter? If you actually find yourself in one of those situations is when you actually beef to start questioning it."
WarriorCats,ffgi0uj,t1_ffgck3f,1579906690.0,"I really love it! But I also just want to beat up Clear Sky all the time. As an early childhood special ed major in college his horribleness to anyone young, sick, injured, and/or weak really gets me fired up."
vegancirclejerk,ffg3vej,t3_etfyyf,1579897889.0,"Well, maybe someone did. But that would be because they choked after trying to swallow that giant seed whole."
unpopularopinion,fffzh8o,t3_etf2wt,1579895181.0,"You're not shy. You have anxiety. Shy people have a harder time speaking up, but can still do it. It IS cute because they're usually soft spoken, look up st you from under their eyelashes, shuffle their feet, and then talk to you. It's like the nerdy anime style girl. It is cute. 

Anxiety is NOT cute. It's a mental illness that makes certain situations extremely hard. You may hyperventilate or have other symptoms. Anxiety makes completely normal things almost impossible to do without completely panicking and a lot of prep. Anxiety, which you have, it's not cute."
unpopularopinion,fffyxq0,t3_etf4yi,1579894845.0,Well... things were different back then. It's not weird if you have no other choice.
namenerds,fffypv2,t3_etf5j6,1579894714.0,They're different too similar. Shouting from across the house? Both kids are very likely to come running because the names are so similar in sound. Parents already get their kids mixed up. Don't make it harder on yourself.
unpopularopinion,fffyg0f,t3_etf5lc,1579894543.0,Exactly. Your partner knows 100% that they are already in a relationship with you. The other person might be a victim too who didn't even know that your partner was in a relationship with you.
books,fffpvar,t3_esal5h,1579889210.0,"I only really use Goodreads to enter giveaways, upkeep my Warrior Cats reading guide that I posted on there, and occasionally to write a review for a book if the mood strikes me. I don't pay attention to friends and followers at all or use Goodreads to look for books to buy or whatever."
books,fffp3zh,t1_fffoknh,1579888738.0,"I have audible so I could listen to a book, but when I'm only in the mood for one particular book and I don't have it....it's frustrating."
books,fffokon,t3_et946o,1579888409.0,"Recently, I've written in every book I've read. I read mostly fiction and so it for fun and as a way to record my present self at that time. I reread a lot and now when I go back to a book a past version of me will be embedded into the pages along with the text. I'll be able to see how I thought and how I'm different now. Annotating is a recording of personal growth for me and an emotional process. 

It's also becoming a way for me to connect with those that I love. I allow my younger sister to borrow my books and have told her that she can annotate them as well if she wants to. She doesn't write nearly as much as I do, but sometimes she'll make a comment or underline something that stuck out to her. It's a way for us to connect and relate to each other. The act of reading which has always been isolating where I'm constrained to just my own thoughts doesn't exist anymore for me because her thoughts are there too. We've even had ""conversations"" in the pages. I'll write something and she'll respond to me comment.with something like, ""Maia, you idiot. I figured that out 50 pages ago and you're STILL questioning if it's true or not?!"" It's fun and freeing. 

I don't stress about keeping a book pure and perfect anymore because books are NOT sacred. They're deep and troubling and messy and full of life and purpose and my annotations are the same way. They have purpose to me because they mean something special to me. For me, a book that's kept perfect on a shelf is a sign of a book that is unloved and not cherished. A book with black marker bleeding through the pages, crinkled pages from gripping the book so hard as you're lost in the world, watermarks and uneven highlighter marks as you mark a passage though your tears...those are signs of a remarkable book that is truly incredible."
books,fffn7je,t3_etasxd,1579887584.0,"I read because it's fun and I enjoy it.

I prefer both audiobooks and physical books. Some books are better told one way over they other. I read audiobooks when the audio version is what I need for that book and I read physical books when the physical version is what I need for that book."
thesims,ffes2lo,t3_et5kzv,1579862795.0,Everybody goes through stages where they can't buy everything that they want. It's called life. That doesn't make stealing right though. Breaking the law doesn't suddenly become okay because your friends do it or your parents want to feed you instead of buying you a game or you feel like you deserve it.
thesims,ffersvt,t3_et6zjq,1579862394.0,I play with walls down unless there's something on a wall that I need to see and then the walls go straight back down as soon as I'm done. I play with large families and don't like my vision obstructed.
