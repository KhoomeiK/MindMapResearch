In 2000, Loria's demands cost the Expos **a TV deal** and English radio broadcasts. Pretty tough to be enthusiastic as a baseball fan when the O is a pain to get to by transit (at the time) and you can't watch the games on TV or listen on the radio if you're not francophone.  Then the team was sold to the league in 2002 and was gutted of their staff and equipment (which Loria, unbelievably, took to Miami).  It was 20 years ago, so I understand how people forget what actually happened, but to blame the people of Montreal for this is unacceptable tbh.

baseball,fdkuq2r,t1_fdkefsg,1578511549.0,"People forget that by 2001, Loria had already been trying to move the Expos for a while (mostly because Montreal wouldn't capitulate to their new stadium demands). In 2000, Loria's demands cost the Expos **a TV deal** and English radio broadcasts. Pretty tough to be enthusiastic as a baseball fan when the O is a pain to get to by transit (at the time) and you can't watch the games on TV or listen on the radio if you're not francophone.  Then the team was sold to the league in 2002 and was gutted of their staff and equipment (which Loria, unbelievably, took to Miami).  It was 20 years ago, so I understand how people forget what actually happened, but to blame the people of Montreal for this is unacceptable tbh.

You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes. And bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free, but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group, and no one would complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests."""
