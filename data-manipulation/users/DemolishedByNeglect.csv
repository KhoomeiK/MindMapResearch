fatlogic,fd71rbz,t1_fd6zx65,1578198377.0,"I don't think I am right, I know I am right, both morally and logically. You continuing to eat meat and eggs and dairy will not affect me personally but it will affect the cows, pigs, chickens + who had to give their lives for your tastebuds momentary pleasure. Have a great life-stealing lives from those that cannot fight back!"
fatlogic,fd6zgsf,t1_fd6yb4y,1578197624.0,"Oh I'm TOTALLY sure all of your animals live an EXCELLENT life before being brutally murdered. No matter how well you treat your animals it does not change the fact that you are exploiting them for money, and it does not change the fact that factory farming is an atrocious industry. 

The fact that you refuse to watch ""bullshit vegan propaganda"" only shows that you are afraid of the truth and might actually have to change your lifestyle to actually match your ""morals."""
fatlogic,fd6y3ks,t1_fd6rsdl,1578197150.0,"You've lost weight not because you increased meat and dairy intake, but because you have a calorie deficit. Watch ""Dominion"" 2018 on Youtube and then come back and tell me if you still feel good about your meat and dairy consumption."
vegan,faayp9q,t3_e89l9v,1575915355.0,"This is so sad lmao. Reminds me of when I went to my uni's orientation and all I could eat at the lunch was some sad unseasoned cauliflower, limp iceberg lettuce, and the most disgusting black bean patty I have ever tasted. Made me seriously reconsider going to school there."
