There is too little empowerment with CS employees in general, and I think that makes a big part of what you complain about. The ""tech support"" is outsourced to a company that doesn't know the product, maybe helping with 20 different ones. They are required to read off the list and not deviate.  Why?

- one is my ""too mentally healthy"" husband who never has suffered from depression, anxiety,  or anything worse than a bad day (mentally). When I would hit moderate/mild depression in our early dating years and wouldn't want to get out of bed on the weekend he literally did not ""get"" it. ""Why don't  you want to get out of bed. Oh, if you want to why dont you just get up?"" I would never wish depression on anyone, but he got a mild case when he was underemployed a year ago for about 3 months, and now he actually gets it, at least a little. He still doesnt have the emotional experience to be a good shoulder to rest on when the world is spinning, even if he tries.

- one is my dad. His was very cultural. His dad said men don't cry, men are strong. When he had me, that was how he knew how to deal. As I noted above, sometimes I struggled. He actually had experienced it, but his way of ""helping"" was to try to do what his dad did to him, which usually resulted in wwIII as a kid, and was never the healthiest of tactics. It is better now that I am far away. I can talk to him, and when he doesn't run the risk of my emotions triggering his, he seems to be more relaxed.

- then there was an old boss of mine. Worst case where he had both weaknesses. Not getting it, and culturally rejected it as weakness. One of the most toxic work environments that was resolved literally within a couple weeks of him quitting and a new boss taking over.  I loved this boss, but some emotional intelligence would make a world of difference for him. The closest to understanding we got was ""I will have the mental process away from work and come back with a concrete plan."" ... positive or negative responses were a big sign of weakness/immaturity to him.

How did I deal with each: found other places to have emotions. It wasnt healthy for either of us.

I havent had them for awhile, but I did get them about 3x right after starting XR. I think the worry about it triggering it is valid.

Also, different strokes for different folks. I happen to really like my job - but my husband would rage quit after 3 days. It needs a rather specific personality to enjoy and thrive in it, and because I suit it, it means outside of work I am surrounding myself with people who balance  me and therefore wouldn't suit it. We recently went through a hiring crisis, and I honestly had no one to recommend.

With my last boss I worked with him for 2.5 years, most of the time I was regularly debting on quitting because we did not get along. In the last 6 months we had finally been getting along, and I thought that was in large part because I had been doing better at many of the things that annoyed him about me (namely he did not do well with emotional responses)

With the entry of my new boss (started mid November) there were so many parallels to when my last boss took over. The response from outsiders was the same. My response was the same. Her response to me mirrors his response. In so many ways I feel teleported back 2.5 years to the worst period I had working at this job, right before everything went to shit. I have rationally been saying ""different people, different situations. There are similarities,  but that doesnt mean history is going to repeat in the same way.""

This next review is a quarterly one, not the official year end - so theoretically I can go in, listen, and not get invested. But she asked me to prep, and she is talking about listing out goals... and I just don't have  my head on straight for this. The things I thought I was balancing and improving are falling apart, the things my previous boss was starting to value with me are things she completely disregards. I have conflicting stances on everything she is going to bring up. Within a minute I am fluxing between ""I am extremely competent and one of the best employees you could have.""
