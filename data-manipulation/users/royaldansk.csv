TheOrville,ffhfbe1,t3_etd8l7,1579932854.0,"Have Admiral Ethan Phillips in there. Like, actual Ethan Phillips playing a descendant of Ethan Phillips the actor.

My headcanon is that the Orville is set in a universe where Star Trek was a TV show (like our universe.) As opposed to the Star Trek universe which didn't have the show ""Star Trek"" to aspire to. 

Obviously, this would mean that some descendants of Star Trek actors would absolutely get so into getting into what's basically Starfleet. It'd be funny if it's Neelix's great great great etc grandson is an Admiral and he just never fails to bring up how he is descended from Neelix. 

And that on most ships, every time he set to visit, most of the crew go through some version of 

""Oh God, Admiral Phillips? You mean the guy who just won't shut up about -""

""Yeah, like, we get it, right? Your great granddad was in Star Trek, but it's not like he was Nog or Garak -""

I mean, if it was an all-male reboot with John C. Reilly and Wil Ferrell and whoever else doing similar humor, I probably wouldn't enjoy it. But it I think it is kind of true that people like movies of men doing this sort of Paul Feig/Melissa McCarthy movie humor when men do it than when women do it. I mean, gross out humor can be funny, but I'm not sure that's what people wanted from Ghostbusters. The original Ghostbusters might have been more like it had Belushi been in it, I guess, but he wasn't. 

But again, I dunno, I think maybe the 2016 movie was irreverent in a way that made it feel like they didn't take the material seriously, even if ironically while the original just made it feel like at least one of them really believed ghosts existed even if they were going to make jokes about it because... well, one of them believes ghosts exist but has made a living out making fun of things that exists anyway.

Philippines,ff9gyct,t1_ff8rgym,1579712793.0,"Doesn't make it not a problem that happens. If Filipinos think it's true, and people do it because they think it's true, and they accept people doing it is fine because they think it's true, then all that means is that it is happening, and that when it happens, nobody tries to change it.

The problem people have with crab mentality isn't that it's ""uniquely"" Filipino. It's that it happens and keeps happening and we'd like to have it stop happening.

That it happens in other places doesn't stop it being a problem, either.

Every time I see ""It happens everywhere"" as a point brought up in one of these ""Filipino toxic culture"" posts, I always think ""Yeah, so it's a problem there, too. Does it being a problem somewhere else fix it here? Is it finite resource? Does it have an exclusivity deal?""

Does finding out that it's a problem introduced by foreigners make it no longer our problem? Will saying ""Hey, it's actually foreigner's fault!"" suddenly make it their problem instead of ours?

Gives some support to the part about Mali/Maali being a healthy, well taken care of elephant. Manila Zoo has problems, but its treatment of the elephant is not one of them.

Edit: Apparently, she was slightly overweight. Possibly because humans, like a volunteer handler, spoiled her a little by doing things like giving her popsicles he bought from local vendors. And she had an elephant companion previously, but they removed him because he was bullying her. So... not lonely, just a single elephant with human friends."

I don't know why they needed to age Jon up in the ""present"" to take Jon to the future slightly older, either. Why didn't they just do a less annoying story line where the Legion brings Superboy back to his time, except they bring older Superboy a few years too early and there's a few adventures where there are two Jon Kents around until they figure it out when the Legion comes back for older Jon. I mean, the Legion apparently thinks the 13th century is ""around the same time"" as the present. 

But that's not what happened, this is what happened, so I dunno. Honestly, the way the characters use time travel often seems so arbitrarily stupid.

Why couldn't he make fake bodies of the people Wally got killed and reveal that they're all just hiding out in the future for a while, because everyone needs to believe Wally killed them for some reason. Also, Arsenal better be trying very hard to go back and clear Wally's name and conscience in that case. But yeah, not what happened *yet*. But I digress."
Philippines,femd04j,t1_femcduc,1579249229.0,"I haven't applied to Canada, but the US consular officers asked questions that I already answered on the form. They'll probably just ask questions they know the answers to (because you already provided them) to make sure you filled the form out yourself, didn't lie on it (remembered what you wrote because it was the truth), that sort of thing.

Just be honest on the form, and honest when asked questions because it's probably going to be stuff on the form. Don't act too nervous, but probably don't act like you're overly confident like you're trying to overcompensate for something you're hiding or something. Know what you need to explain, but don't practice too much because they're probably on the lookout for people who sound coached or something.

I dunno, don't make a big deal out of it, I guess, but don't act like it's nothing either? I don't know if any of that helps. Just be sincere and hope ""I don't actually want to stay there that long"" comes through without having to say it."
Philippines,fembqdh,t1_femavxy,1579247561.0,"On the other hand, not applying at all results in a 100% chance of not getting the visa. That's worse than 95%.

OP should just be truthful, prepare whatever supporting documents even if they probably won't even look at them. Can't hurt to have an invitation letter from the aunts even if it probably can't or won't help either (they're not going to ask for them).

Maybe they'll ask a question and OP can truthfully say ""It's a graduation present."" and maybe they'll believe OP and approve the tourist visa. Because they do ask questions, sometimes.

It would only get less believable as a reason to travel if it's years after graduation after OP's already gone on various trips and has a job they can't possibly take 3 months vacation from.

OP has to decide whether or not they're willing to spend money for a chance they'll be allowed into Canada as a tourist."

DCcomics,felx6yz,t1_fek52n8,1579233196.0,"Why she'd include ""the stress of who you'd become"" seems a bit mean of her. Like, I assume Damien just takes it for granted that he's going to be Batman. If he's stressed out about the prospect of becoming Batman, he'd probably find it weird that suddenly, he's getting weird dreams while also being sure it's the stress of becoming Batman that's causing them. If he hasn't had weird dreams before, and hasn't immediately thought it's from the stress of anticipating being Batman, he's going to be so suspicious and he's going to conclude it's a mind-wipe.

Bat-characters are very suspicious about mind-wipes. Batman hates them (Identity Crisis?), Nightwing's very mad at it right now.

Damien's should absolutely know there was a mind wipe because of how carelessly she did this.

But also, Damien probably isn't stressed out at all by the prospect of becoming Batman (the thing he'd assume is what he becomes in the future) or even the Demon's Head. He's Damien, isn't he like, confident he'll do very good at things. He's not Dick, or Tim, or Jason who'd maybe have qualms about being Batman.

Edit: Oh my god, bot, this bot made me second guess spelling it Damien because I thought ""Which one looks more wrong? I should pick that one so the bot doesn't correct me."""

They might be able to wear these to birthday parties or blessings of their new houses (they're going to have to build new houses). 

Even farmers and fishermen go to parties sometimes. And apparently, with the amount of food and entertainment the rest of Batangas (and the Philippines) is giving evacuees, some of the smaller children already think it's someone's party they're attending."
