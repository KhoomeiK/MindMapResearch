infj,fcx0kgw,t3_ejbs8t,1578045815.0,Great opinion on love.  I realize (this is my opinion) that this emotion of love is more of a hindrance than benefit.  Humans wants to love and be loved this I believe leads to people wanting to fit in with groups of people who they may or may not like.  When you feel like you don't fit in you suffer emotional stress and loneliness.  When you do fit in or find love it may only be instant gratification and may hold restrictions on you.  When it ends you suffer again.  Companionship and friendship even if temporary is sufficient for me.  It is understandable as humans we are innately programmed to want love and be loved.  What if you can find that SO who can be both a companion and lover?

family,fcox327,t3_ei9hr4,1577843953.0,There is not enough information to support your case from what your explanation is about your aunt.  I agree that as an adult no body in their right mind should be controlling of anyone.  However we as the audience don't even know how you live and as to why your aunt would be so worried about you.  If you are living a healthy fulfilling life your aunt shouldn't have to worry.

GetMotivated,fcje8xh,t3_eh9dzk,1577684515.0,IMO a cut down tree is not a good representation of not giving up but hopefully people get the message.  I thought it was funny at least.
