&#x200B;

Harry Stonecipher was appointed President of Boeing, and immediately began to destroy the 'culture' of Boeing operations.

&#x200B;

Here's a solid executive summary, from [nearly ten years ago](https://leehamnews.com/2011/07/21/mcboeing-787s-insidious-impact-overwhelm-product-strategy/).. since most of you will never read the article.  Ironically, this article was written skewering the failures and delays of the 787 development, which have had many teething problems, and still continue to an extent in production at the eastern, ex-MDC facilities.  But they aren't literally killing passengers..

*In what turned out to be the most notorious placements, MDC’s CEO Harry Stonecipher became Boeing’s COO and widely was perceived to overwhelm a weak Phil Condit, Boeing’s CEO. Mike Sears, later of KC-767-Darleen Drunyan tanker infamy, moved from MDC to become Boeing’s CFO.*

*John McDonnell and Stonecipher, the largest shareholders in Boeing after the merger, went on the Board of Directors and formed a powerhouse team. They and directors allied with them dominated the Board.*

*It was this MDC-dominated leadership and Board that sent Boeing into a downward spiral. MDC starved Douglas Aircraft for R&D money and relied on derivatives.* ***\[MD built 3 commercial jet aircraft designs in 50 years from 1950-2000, to Boeing's 7\]*** *During the period 1998-2003, Boeing’s R&D fell precipitously, drawing scathing criticism from the normally pro-Boeing consultant, Richard Aboulafia of The Teal Group. Boeing offered derivatives of in the form of the 737-900 (not today’s more successful ER), 757-300 and 767-400, all sales duds. Boeing talked and talked and talked about new airplanes but had no action. It talked about three different derivatives of the 747 and the fanciful Sonic Cruiser.*

*By the time the end of 2003 rolled around, serious analysts were questioning whether Boeing would withdraw from the commercial airplane business.*

*Then the 7E7 was given the Authority to Offer in December 2003. By this time, the weak Condit was gone, done in with Mike Sears in the tanker scandal. Stonecipher had become CEO and proudly launched the 7E7, later renamed the 787. But Stonecipher and the MDC-dominated Board demanded of Alan Mulally a new scheme as a condition of the 7E7 launch: a global production system to lower the financial risk to Boeing.*

*An April 2003 article in the Wall Street Journal by then-aerospace reporter Lynn Lunsford detailed the debate within the Board. Although today Boeing says the global outsourcing was necessary for strategic reasons to accommodate a changing global market and win sales, the debate then was all about financial risk. The MDC-dominated Board wanted Boeing to spend no more than $5bn on development of the 7E7, according to the article.*

*The irony, according to the article, is that one Board member worried that too much emphasis was being placed on cost savings and that Airbus would be able to benefit as a result. The name of this Board member: Jim McNerney.*

&#x200B;

So, TEN YEARS AGO most aerospace and airline analysts knew Boeing was in trouble, because the 787 development took far too long, was distributed around the world and outsourced 'to save money', and because of this they cancelled any intent to create outright clean-sheet replacements for the 737 and 777.

Harry Stonecipher and John McDonnell took over Boeing, and ran it into the ground like they ran McDonnell-Douglas into the ground; by refusing to ever put their own money as shareholders on the line to win new business with new products.  The only reason Boeing isn't already bankrupt and forgotten is because Airbus screwed the pooch so badly in overreach and expense with the A380 design; had it been as successful and versatile as the 747 Airbus would be dominating the industry today, instead of only roughly equal with Boeing.  The A380 will barely break-even or lose small amounts of money after 25+ years of production and use, vs the historical sales and profitability of the 747 over 50 years, which made billions for Boeing in the end.

In the 1960s, Boeing literally bet the farm on the 747 design, and it turned out to be the perfect design to catch trends in business and travel, dominating the industry for 30 years.  The A380 tried to do the same but had numerous mistakes and deliberate omissions, and didn't have the same economic luck either."
