It is obtainable. Just not in the next year, let alone 4 years. Imo you should focus on your next step - college, military, work, community college.

I also experienced a lot of anxiety over picking a purpose in life. I wanted a career goal that I could throw myself into. Never found it and I'm not sure I will. I'm okay with that now.

I can probably offer more advice about college if you have any specific questions or want any general advice. I'm a senior and help advise some of my underclassmen."
bipolar2,ffw1atp,t3_evcesf,1580280161.0,I started this month and I'm so nervous to miss it. I was such a wreck off of it.
bipolar2,ffw11dv,t3_eveyqi,1580279882.0,This is a beautiful pie made by a beautiful person! Great work! Happy you're here to share it with us!
bipolar2,ffr31os,t1_ffq7p43,1580149370.0,"That sounds extremely stressful, I'm glad your medication is helping you. I was also unable to properly make new connections with people before. I just didn't feel happy and would always rather be in bed or alone then hanging out with people."
bipolar2,ffr2qum,t1_ffqs6pj,1580149182.0,"My doctor wholeheartedly agreed with me.

It's a little hard to explain. I guess the best way to put it is my goal - to treat the depression - had been met, with the added bonus of stabalizing my mood. I'm a little worried about becoming desensitized in the future also. So there was just no point. If I needed it I would have gone up and in the future I might need to."
bipolar2,ffpclax,t1_ffokdy9,1580091678.0,"Sorry for being unclear. I felt better the day after starting 25mg and felt even more stabalized after 50mg. I was supposed to go up to 100mg but I called my doctor and talked to her. The goal for me was to fix the depression which at worst was debilitating and at best made my quality of life low and unable to enjoy things. As a bonus I no longer suddenly snap at things that are irritating which hurt my loved ones.

I'm not ruling out the placebo effect or the fact I'm very sensitive to medication (I'm around 110lbs) but it was a very drastic difference and at 3+ weeks very consistant and personally little side effects. I was on lexapro and it made my made stomach ache all the time and I felt foggy and numb.

Tldr: 25mg then now 50mg and staying there."
bipolar2,ffo6jsh,t3_eucg2w,1580074633.0,"I cant say how theyre supposed to feel for you. For me on a low dose for Lamotrigine my depression cleared up immediatly. I still dipped in mood occassionally but they succeeded where lexapro had failed. Also I had less bouts of sudden irritation. 

You should ask about how quickly it takes effect. If, after the time period you feel it just never helps, talk to your doctor about their suggestions maybe a higher dosage or alternative/additional medication - do not go cold turkey off of whatever you're taking without direct permission from your doctor. If there are withdrawel effects you will only feel worse."
