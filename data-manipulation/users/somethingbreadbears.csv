I don't remember it like that. We knew Matt and Ryan were leaving, we just didn't know who was replacing them. I don't get why that's any of our business. I don't know the full staff at Turner but I still watch HBO. And they make tons of mistakes.

Game Grumps making money isn't the same as us spending it.

I didn't say he shouldn't bother. I said that it would be an incredible waste of time to go thru the YT comments, twitter, reddit, all of that if it still meant that he'd be answering the same question over and over again. It's not productive and this sub has proven time and time again that it can generate a problem from the smallest inconvenience.

Like I originally joked, if Arin took the time to respond to every single grievance game grumps fans come up with he wouldn't have time to do game grumps.

It's one thing to want communication between creator and viewer. It's another when fans seem to have a problem with everything. Like when Arin goes through a process of picking a new editor and their fan base revolts within a few days. Which is exactly what happened with Matt and Ryan and Ben. In some cases he does address the problem, like switching to longer episodes. And yet there are still people who don't watch the video or read the thread explaining it."

No that part is great. It's that this has kind of been his mode of operation. He creates a big problem, kind of fixes it, and then gets praise. It was the same thing with the government shut down. It's like, yes, we are happy he ended it because jesus fuck it could've been worse. But then it's also not wanting to give him satisfaction for a problem that is largely his fault to begin with. 

I didn't know who this Iranian general was until a few days ago. Maybe the world is a better place without him, I probably will never know because that stuff is classified. However, what I do know is that Trump created a martyr and then floundered committing war crimes (bombing cultural sites) and then turned around and was like ""oh this isn't a big deal, we'll work something out."" And it's like...if it wasn't a big deal, why did it *become* a big deal? Why couldn't just once, just one time, he handle something with discretion?
