Take it from someone who got in a fight with a girl in the third grade. It was a hella stupid scenario. We were playing this random game in the neighbor's yard with this flying toy thing.

By all means, it was not like I was proud of what I did. I got into a lot of trouble, and kids in school talked shit about me for hitting a girl. I didn't quite understand it back then, but it was one of my first experiences with double standards.

Even now in 2020, people still don't know what the hell they actually think is OK. There is a reason why social experiments can have a chick beat up a dude in public = no one intervenes. A guy touches a chick = hell to pay.

Also, your tags are off. Don't put garbage tags in there that are not helping. Tag the relevant stuff. Having the character names = good. Having tags like ""the true story"" won't get you anywhere. They might as well not be there at all.

Finally, you're not sharing your stuff. You have to think of anything on the internet like a web. If you aren't trying to share your content with other platforms and social media (Facebook, Twitter or whatever), it's not going to budge. If you want your name/content to travel to other parts of the (YouTube web), you need to spread your part of the web to connect to others.

Asian kids are deemed to be the ""smart kids"" in a class by default. That's extra pressure. Asian parents (especially ones from Asia) think only perfect scores matter in grades. Everything else might as well be an F. 

As a combination of both of these aspects, an Asian kid can do everything they can do grade-wise, but it might not be enough.

As the oldest, I always get extra shit when something goes wrong. I tried so damn hard to be a ""good kid."" I purposefully stayed out of trouble as much as I could. 

Still didn't matter in the sense that any random thing suddenly gets amplified because I am the oldest."

I'm in the camp where I believe subtle (with all due respect) is a lot better than either extreme. Like, yeah, they could have showed him making out with a dude in an episode (but honestly, I don't see that in his character). They could have had an episode where they found him at a gay bar or something.

At the end of the day, I always thought him being gay was after the fact. His psychology skills = have always made him a good character regardless of his sexual orientation."

College admissions literally can and will fuck over the ""wrong"" kind of person, which is inherently discriminating, especially when it's about someone's race (white, Asian or whomever). You're trying to justify actual discrimination.

In your mind, you think it's OK if your race gets benefited.

For Asians, the academic bar is set way high. An Asian student with good grades is just another good Asian student. Getting all A's and high SAT scores = still not enough for some colleges.

Conversely, black students face racism of low expectations. Black students get a lot of extra leeway for their grades. Hell, SAT scores get hella bumped up for them being black. How can anyone in their right mind not interpret this as the schools implying that black kids are too stupid without a score handicap?"

As someone who suspects that I am somewhere on some kind of autism spectrum (never officially diagnosed, but it has been clear looking back in my life that I have never really fit in properly), I have had my share of challenges with the social aspect of work.

I have always been quite awkward (it was way worse when I was younger). I never quite gelled with a lot of people. Never really said the right things at the right time. Didn't know how to mingle.

I always busted my ass off to the best of my ability at my jobs. Always tried my best. But despite all of that hard work, they always ended up promoting the people who had the social skills. I could work circles around some of these people, but they kissed ass because I didn't want to do that."
nottheonion,ff3n0oi,t3_erbflf,1579544537.0,"Yeah, I do believe in working hard, but I also want to strive to end up being my own boss.

I have had a lot of bad experiences with being ""used up"" like a damn condom. Places will get everything they can out of you if they're even a bit rotten. 

They'll tack on extra tasks. You want to be a good worker, so you put up with it and then keep saying you're a ""team player."" They take advantage of you.

You end up doing more and more tasks beyond your pay grade. Before you know it, you're already doing so much with pretty much no extra benefit. Just because.

Some bosses really do suck ass."
TrueOffMyChest,ff3lmtd,t3_erbzb8,1579543675.0,"Nah, fuck them.

Maybe some will call me a backward fucker, but I do believe in the notion of hard work. Hell, I am someone who got denied a student manager position back in college for working too hard (yes, this is what my damn letter said).

Honestly, OP, I wouldn't interpret what your boss says as the truth. Chances are you're not kissing enough ass. A lot of people in higher positions want someone to get on their knees and degrade themselves. 

Sure, there are some good bosses who will acknowledge true hard work, consistent values like being on time and shit, but then you have plenty of d-bags who think you're not ""good enough"" for some stupid reason.

There is a reason why so many places just end up promoting not necessarily the best of the best but instead focus on promoting the best ass-kissers of the bunch."
facepalm,ff3la4i,t1_ff3k4io,1579543458.0,"Meh, nature of online reviews.

There is always two sides to every story. With every customer, you normally just bring them water. But when the lady tells you she doesn't want water and just wants to drink tea, whose fault is that?

At the end of the day, I know what really happened. I could be a petty asshole and chime in that she didn't want water, but it's moot. Just more drama for no reason."
facepalm,ff3iyl8,t1_ff3ifvm,1579542042.0,"Can't please them all.

There are always picky and annoying customers. One time at a restaurant I worked at, this customer tells me she didn't want water with her meal. Specifically tells me she just wants to drink tea. I bring her tea like she asks.

Later, she writes a negative review saying I refused to offer her water. Yeah, stupid bitch. I clearly didn't hear you tell me you just wanted tea and no water. 

Besides, when it comes to reviews, you have to take some with a grain of salt."

As guys, the best way is to be as ""neutral"" as possible. It's funny because chicks call guys, dudes, males or whatever. If a guy were to complain, there would be hell to pay.

TrueOffMyChest,ff26mg6,t3_er23ia,1579495292.0,"Pff, we live in a funny world.

Honestly, I am going to say a good chunk of people here in the West do not really give a shit about someone being gay - and I mean this with all due respect. As in, it legit doesn't really matter.

Yeah, there are some people who actually hate gays. There are people who poke fun at people for being homosexual. They'll always exist.

Of course, keep in mind that someone being gay in the West has it pretty damn good. Feel bad for the people in other countries where being gay is seen as an actual crime where they face actual punishments.

But for me here in the likes of America, I legit do not care if someone is gay. Being neutral is a good thing in its own way as well, yet people think everything needs to be either extreme.

Be neutral. Be cool about it. It doesn't have to be a big deal in either direction."
