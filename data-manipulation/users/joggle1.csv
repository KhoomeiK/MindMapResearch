For comparison, I checked Thule's return policy. It's pretty good, with free return shipping and no restocking fee. However, they don't reimburse for the original shipping charges.

I also checked Yakima's return policy. They don't reimburse for shipping and also charge restocking fees.

Is there a popular roof rack manufacturer that refunds all shipping (or has free shipping both ways) without a restocking fee?

The absolute best return policy I know of is by REI (100% refund for up to 1 year from purchase with no restocking fee). So while Tesla's store is no REI, it doesn't seem worse than other roof rack manufacturers at least. I agree they should add more details to their return policy though."

When the states were created they weren't really considering how future populations may grow or shrink. When Wyoming was created they pointed out that other states, like Illinois, were also small when they first became states. They assumed it would grow quickly like the other states but that never happened and won't likely happen in the future.

> That's right. The first season with Alex, you could buzz as soon as the answer appeared on screen. The second season they changed to the current rule of being able to buzz in as soon as Alex finishes reading the question. I taped a show for the second season but before the second season started airing. It completely blew my strategy out of the water and I didn't have time to adjust because I got randomly selected to compete on the first show they taped that day. I came in second so I was out of there quickly. However, I can't say I would have won if they hadn't changed the rules.

> A few years later my cousin got on and won a couple days. I talked to her before she taped the shows and told her the buzzer is key. You get locked out for like a second if you buzz before they allow buzzing so you can't buzz too early. If you wait for a fraction of a second too long after Alex finishes speaking, another contestant will get to answer.

Is there a MSP that doesn't have a monthly fee?

It would be a good idea to make a table and a big article about all of the MSPs per kWh price, monthly fees and about how much charging would be needed to be worth it. It'd take a lot of work though if you wanted to cover all of them in all regions. I agree that'd be a better article than this one, but this one was just focused on the press release I guess.

And if you *really* wanted to be accurate you'd need to add tax in the US (already included in the Europe prices). For example, for a $13.20 charging session I paid an additional $1.02 in tax (7.7%) in Colorado.

It doesn't state how much it costs for the various Mobility Service Providers only that it's 'financially attractive' for people who regularly use the IONITY network.

The only price in the entire news release is the 0.79 EUR per kWh.

I had to look up the price at one of the MSPs as Ionity doesn't seem to list them on their site. For Audi e-Tron Charging Service in the UK it costs 0.30 GBP / kWh with a 16.95 GBP / month contract with a minimum length of 12 months. For Germany it's 0,33 € / kWh with a 17,95 € / month fee, also minimum contract of 12 months.

In comparison, Tesla Superchargers that charge per kWh have been about 0.22-0.25 dollars / kWh (and I presume higher in California).

So even Ionity's discounted price is higher and that requires a yearly cost of over 200 euros plus the charging fees. For it to cost less than 3 times Tesla's Supercharger's rate you'd need to charge about 680 kWh (for comparison, I drove 2,500 miles/4,000 km on a road trip using that much power). For it to only cost double Tesla's Supercharger rate you'd need to charge about 2,100 kWh (enough to go about 7,500 miles, roughly 12,000 km). I don't think many people will drive more than that in a year on road trips, especially in Europe so even with a contract you're likely to spend twice as much (or more) with Ionic compared to Tesla Superchargers in the US.

It's also a pretty big deal. The Government Accountability Office is officially stating that Trump broke the law and his sworn duty as president under the constitution. That's the first time they've accused a president of breaking the law in their 100 year history.

During the entire impeachment process to date Republicans have claimed no law was broken and used that as one of their primary defenses of the president. This directly counters that defense. And this has nothing to do with the phone call but the undisputed actions taken by the administration to block funds from going to Ukraine.

This is also only the third time a US president has been impeached (with the caveat that Nixon would have been impeached if he hadn't resigned first). This doesn't happen every day and is about as a big of a deal as it can possibly get in politics between elections.

Yesterday, the big news of the day was Putin consolidated power in Russia so it's not like Russia is being ignored by the world press. The war is dying down and there's an agreement for the region to reunite with Ukraine (although with a special administrative status they didn't previously have). Except for the peace talks it hasn't made the news as much recently because there haven't been as many casualties lately."

Not only does your brain not store memories accurately, it will convince you that your memories *are* accurate so you can be confident when you recall them.

> Lord Dawson's notes assert that he had been told by Queen Mary and the Prince of Wales - the playboy son who was to become Edward VIII and, less than a year later, would abdicate and become the Duke of Windsor - that they did not want the King's life needlessly prolonged if his illness was clearly fatal. There is no indication that the King himself had been consulted.

The details of how he died were kept secret for 50 years.

It's extremely unusual for a Model 3 to not be able to engage cruise control. I've driven over 30,000 miles and I've only once had a case where I inexplicably couldn't turn cruise control on (rebooting the computer fixed it).

teslamotors,fefqx2p,t3_eolqql,1579062630.0,"That's the best video comparing range of EVs I've seen to date. I think it could still be improved though:

1) verify that all cars have the recommended tire pressure at the start of the test (could drop if it's cold)

2) start all cars at 100%, preferably pre-conditioned if the car supports that feature

3) now that they know how each car behaves when the battery is nearly dead, drive on the highway until the alert is triggered. That would be the effective range at highway speed. Then note how much farther the car could go at x mph (some low speed that's consistent with each other, perhaps 20 mph). They were pretty inconsistent with how they hypermiled until the battery was dead.

4) repeat the test with AP engaged. It was strange that he couldn't turn it on, perhaps the car was brand new and hadn't calibrated the cameras yet. Without cruise control his driving behavior may have impacted the car's range.

5) start the test earlier in the day so that it's still daytime when they finish driving. The temperature usually drops quickly after the sun sets so it'd be nice to try to drive with a more consistent temperature. Otherwise cars that drive farther will time driving in colder weather than ones with less range."

Given how egregious Iran's behavior was after they had shot it down and how it would have been trivial to prevent I can't see any way of them not getting most of the blame for it. They will likely have a trial for one or more of their chain of command and I'd be surprised if they're not punished for it.

If they could have blamed the US for it they certainly would have. But they can't and still consider themselves to have a professional military.

So even Iran's own government will accept at least some of the blame for it (publicly they already have). So the only question is roughly how you'd split the blame."
news,fecf83c,t1_fec5pj2,1578972490.0,"I did specifically anticipate civilian causalities on both sides. But there's a limit to how much is entirely one side's fault. Shooting a civilian jet in your own controlled airspace is a mistake of unbelievable proportions. I don't believe any other country has previously shot down a jet controlled by their government's agencies. Then they blatantly denied it and even began attempting to bulldoze the site of the crash. That's inexcusable behavior. There's no point where the government did not know they had shot down that jet, there's zero possibility they didn't know they were lying when they denied it.

Iran could have closed their airspace. That would have been a prudent action, especially as they were anticipating a retaliatory attack. Or they could have verified that it was a civilian jet in a number of ways (have someone watch departing flights from the nearby airport, tracking each flight as it left on their military radar and civilian radar, etc).

One sad irony of the situation is Iran has long claimed that it was impossible to accidentally shoot down a civilian jet and used this 'fact' against the US for decades. They now have to admit that it is possible to accidentally shoot down a civilian airliner."

I would have anticipated American military or civilian casualties in Iraq when Iran retaliated followed by military and civilian casualties in Iran in a reprisal attack, etc. but not specifically airliners being shot down by SAMs in Iran.
