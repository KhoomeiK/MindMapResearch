AskReddit,feljynj,t1_fel9ypb,1579223990.0,"I'm not following your logic, here. Are you disputing the fact that Alaska has a high rape rate or the teacher's claimed cause?

I think it is pretty indisputable that Alaska has a high rape rate. ([More than double the 2nd highest rape rate state.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/232563/forcible-rape-rate-in-the-us-by-state/))

The cause(s) of the high rape rate in Alaska very well may be up for debate. Your teacher claims it is because there are more men than women in Alaska. This very well may be a dumb reason and there very well may be many approaches to attack this line of reasoning. But I fail to see how your response undermines your teacher's reasoning. Your assertion that Alaska has a high (you claim ""the highest"") CCW carry rate which correlates to fewer rapes (switching to raw number of reported instances rather than rate or per capita) is at best irrelevant, at worst undermines your own argument that higher CCW carry rate protects women from rape. 

Look at it this way, if higher CCW carry rate correlates with fewer rapes (which would decrease the rape rate), and if Alaska has the highest CCW carry rate, then one might reasonably expect Alaska to also have the lowest (or very low) raw number of reported rapes and a very low (possibly the lowest) rape rate. However, the indisputable fact (Alaska has the highest rape rate) remains. Thus, it appears to me that the relative ""high"" or ""low"" prevalence of CCW in Alaska is largely irrelevant to rape rate. At best (assuming you are 100% correct on your argument), the high CCW rate leads to a little lower rape rate than it would otherwise be if the CCW rate in Alaska were 0. But if that were the case, then what you are arguing is that *despite* very noble efforts to reduce rape (increasing CCW rate), Alaska *still* has the highest rape rate in the country. 

Effectively, the only thing you have established is that CCW rate is either entirely irrelevant to or has insufficient effect on rape rate in Alaska. 

Your feminist teacher doesn't need me to defend her. (I won't.)  But I think her follow up question to you merits some further thought on your part beyond ""CCW good."" (I don't dispute your assertion, either.)

Imagine if I told you that donuts are unhealthy because they have more calories than cake. And you responded that I'm wrong because water is blue. Then I respond with, ""What does that have to do with it?"" You go into a lengthy explanation about the color of water.

There is no such thing as ""consensus"" in the scientific community. Anyone trying to rely on ""consensus,"" there is a really good chance they are relying on junk science (aka ""fake news""). There is data. Cold hard data. We (humans and scientists) can extrapolate and try to predict based on that data, but any scientist worthy of the title will admit that the data is only helpful until it isn't. We can even form opinions based on that data, but those opinions are, well, just opinions. (And this is where I think a lot of people have a tough time distinguishing between fact and opinion.) Data can be misleading for any number of reasons in any number of different circumstances. Data can be manipulated. (And good scientists will acknowledge this.) Any time someone tries to predict the future, I'm skeptical. Any time someone says that the future is a foregone conclusion (""it is not a matter of if, but when"") I become super skeptical. That starts to smell like someone is selling something. 

What do I believe? (I admit, I may be wrong on some of these, but this is what I believe):

* Measuring techniques have changed (improved) over time. This leads me to believe that measuring techniques will continue to change (and hopefully improve) as time continues to progress. Changes (even if improvements) lead to inconsistencies. 
* Technology changes. Humans are constantly working to manipulate and improve their environment. (At present, I enjoy indoor plumbing and HVAC unheard of 200 years ago.)
* Weather changes over time. Climate changes over time. 
* Climate is different from weather. Predicting the weather is difficult, but we're getting better at it. Predicting climate change is also difficult, but we're getting better at it. I assume we will continue to get better at predicting weather and climate as time continues to progress. 
* To be perfectly honest, I do not know how much ""climate change"" is attributable to human behavior. I suspect more than 0% and less than 100%. I'm not sure that I care all that much exactly how much is attributable to humans, though. I do not consider ""man-made"" technology to be ""unnatural."" Humans are natural. Humanity is a result of natural development. Homo sapiens have developed tools and technology and, hopefully, will continue to do so. In my mind, synthetic (""man-made"") is not inherently bad. I like my air conditioner. I like my heater. I like my potable water. I like my laptop computer and wifi and netflix. It is not clear to me where so-called environmentalists draw the line at what technology is ""good"" or ""acceptable"" and what is ""bad"" and why do they draw the line there and not elsewhere? The only ""consensus"" seems to be CO2 bad. But even that's disingenuous. What they really mean is CO2 from combustion engines (cars) is bad. CO2 from cows and volcanos is fine (because its natural and not ""man-made""). But no, not everyone agrees with that, either. 

A couple more things I believe:

* Eventually, we are going to run out of all those fuels that create the CO2. The same ~~scientists~~ political activists who are predicting global warming apocalypse are the same ones who are saying we will have no gasoline for our cars and no coal for our electrical plants in 50 or 100 years (or whatever their preferred timeline is these days). Yes, I think looking at alternative energy is a great idea, but I do not believe it is time to panic. Let's do this intelligently.  I will switch over to an alternative power transportation vehicle when it becomes a viable long-term solution. 
* Most of the ""solutions"" to global warming are nothing more than an excuse to impose taxes."

Come to think of it, I probably would not waste time doing high school sports. Sure, there were some fun times, but there were a lot of not fun times, also. Injuries and painful experiences that, perhaps necessary to help me become who I am today, I don't need to relive. Nothing ever came of any of my high school sports. No records broken or set.

&#x200B;

> he should have been given a societal re-introduction program that housed him and found him gainfully employed with paying for damages and a small probation and community service period. 

What exactly do you think Charles Dickens / Scrooge was referring to when he asked, ""Are there no workhouses?"" You have proposed to send the Taco Bell thief to the workhouse, just like Scrooge. Since you have quoted Dickens, I assume you are also familiar with the gentleman's response to Scrooge's suggestion that the poor be directed to the workhouses (instead of soliciting Scrooge for charity).

[""Many can't go there; and many would rather die.""](http://www.open-bks.com/library/classics/dickens_charles_carol/carol-11-12.html)

Which, of course, is what elicits the famous reply from Scrooge, ""If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.""

Assuming there are programs in place to temporarily house the homeless and provide the training and employment opportunities, just as you suggested, how would you then respond to the gentleman's response? How do you know that this Taco Bell thief would rather die (or worse, steal from Taco Bell) than go to the local employment office or homeless shelter? 

Keep in mind that involuntary employment is not all that different from slavery or prison. You can't force a man to work. You can't force a man to learn or change. Every man has the right to make his own decisions, but he must also accept the consequences of those decisions. You assume that this Taco Bell thief has no job, no home, and needs ""societal re-introduction"" (which sounds an awful lot like a re-education or indoctrination, depending on who's running the program). But, like Scrooge, you and I don't know that. 

Furthermore, since you seem to be fond of lenient punishment for criminals (an observation, not a criticism), what are your feelings about the charwoman (Mrs. Dilber), the laundress, the undertaker's man, and Old Joe? [""Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop...""](http://www.open-bks.com/library/classics/dickens_charles_carol/carol-109-110.html) (the encounter is described over the course of several pages during Scrooge's visit from the 3rd ghost). They unashamedly stole property from Scrooge upon his death. His bed sheets and linens, some office supplies, some silver, some shoes and shirts and other apparel. Scrooge was horrified, but they felt no remorse. They felt entitled (and positively giddy) since Scrooge was so miserly in his life. What are your thoughts on this? Are they justified? Should they suffer any consequence? Presumably, no one will ever find out they stole because the victim (Scrooge) was deceased. Does it seem right to you to permit the poor to steal from the rich (or anyone for that matter), simply because they are poor?  At what point does one cross the threshold from ""it is acceptable and forgivable for this person to steal"" to ""it is acceptable and forgivable to steal from this person""?

But even if he were, Taco Bell? C'mon! If he truly were lacking for food and shelter, surely there are about 100 other options before Taco Bell. It may come as a shock to you, but not all homeless people are criminals or resort to stealing food and electronics.  Especially on Christmas day, I bet there were dozens of places nearby where dude could've gotten a meal MUCH better than Taco Bell. So even if you are right, that this dude is homeless and starving to death and has no choice but to resort to crime in order to survive, I'm still going to laugh at his choice of TACO BELL. BWAHAHAHA!

It is more likely (or at least equally likely) that the dude is impaired. Maybe the dude had a great year, just got his Christmas bonus, and celebrated by going out and getting wasted and then, under the influence, decided it would be a good idea to grab some Taco Bell, and then decided to take a little nap. Whether by choice (alcohol or some other drug) or by disease (mental disorder or disability), the guy in this video is not thinking straight. Either way, I think it is indisputable that this was a series of poor decisions on his part. This is not something that is happening to him. This is a direct result of his choices and actions. And yes, I find it funny while not condoning his actions.

> This is like laughing at homeless people. 

Homeless people can be funny. Its ok to laugh at them when they do funny things. I'm not laughing at the fact that they are homeless, but it is ok to laugh at some of the things they do WHILE they are homeless. Homeless people are still people and people can be very funny. Here, I'm not laughing at the fact that this dude is a criminal breaking the law. That's not funny. That part is quite serious and the dude should be prosecuted. I'm not laughing at the fact that the dude is hungry.   I'm laughing at HOW he is going about it. Breaking into a TACO BELL on Christmas, making a meal and then taking a nap is hilarious. No one got hurt. It is funny. And I hope they catch him. 

Again, the dude got a meal and a nap. This is clearly shown in the video. In what way is he suffering? Eating food and sleeping is not suffering. You can't accuse me of laughing at someone else's suffering if he's not suffering. You assume he's homeless, but the only evidence of homelessness is the fact that he committed a crime. I contend that homelessness is not synonymous with criminal activity. I see no evidence in this video (or in the one article I read on the subject linked further below) that indicates this dude is suffering in any way. 

So go ahead and keep defending this criminal. Maybe his criminal activity seems fair and reasonable to you. Or at least justified. Just don't hurt your arm patting yourself on the back for your ""tolerance"" and ""compassion"" when you say something like anyone who thinks this is funny is cruel."

I'm just saying try not to feel bad (and actually try to feel good) about receiving help. 

Several years ago, there was an older gentleman in my neighborhood who was just the kindest soul. Everyone loved him. He was a pretty smart and handy fellow and always willing to help fix stuff around the house. I'm not talking total building reno (although he probably would have done that, too, if you asked). More like if you needed to patch a hole in your drywall, he'd have the tools and supplies and teach you how to do it (or do it himself for you). Something wrong with your car? He'd help you get it working. One side of the gutter starting to come loose? He's up on the ladder fastening it down. Just generally helpful in all ways. Even just a caring ear if you just needed someone to talk to. 

At one point, a whole bunch of bad stuff happened to this poor guy. Serious health issues hit him at the same time that he experienced a loss in his family. The whole neighborhood wanted to take care of him. Bring him meals. Mow his lawn. Get him groceries. Take him to/from dr. appointments. That sort of thing. He absolutely refused. You practically had to fight him to do anything nice for him. And then he was grumpy about it. He genuinely did not want any help. I remember thinking it was so weird.

I completed the training and made my initial investment with saved lawn-mowing money. Worked there all summer long, totally hounding all my friends parents and my parents friends. Ugh was I brainwashed. I still think they're good knives, but way overpriced. I had a handful of people take mercy on me and buy a knife or two, but no one ever bought a whole set. I did make money on the effort, but not much. Certainly not more than minimum wage. I also worked two other part-time jobs that summer. My cold water wake up call occurred when I turned in my referrals. They had some gimmick going on where you had to ask every prospect for referrals and for every 5 referrals your prospect provided, their name and your name would be placed in a drawing for something like a Hawaii vacation or something. More referrals = more chances at the drawing. Cool. I was lead to believe there was a monthly drawing. (Spoiler: There wasn't.) When I first started, I was pretty happy if my prospects could come up with (were willing to provide) 1 or 2 referrals, each. It took me a while to get like 10 referrals or something and my ""trainer"" kept telling me how far behind all the other trainees I was. Apparently, (supposedly) they were getting hundreds of referrals every day. Well, one time I did the presentation at one of my friends parents house and this woman, who was just super sweet, decided that since she couldn't afford to buy anything, she might as well give me a bunch of referrals. I sat there for a good 45 minutes or so while she hand wrote all the contacts in her little book into my referral book (this was before smart phones). I was so happy and proud when I saw my ""trainer"" that next week. Here are something like 10 entries for the monthly drawing! He looked confused. What drawings? I explained. He chuckled and said our office only submits one name to that drawing per year and we've already submitted one this year. (Year, not monthly.) You have to have the highest number of referrals for the entire year, and THEN your name gets submitted to the national drawing. No, prospects never get their name in the drawing unless they join your downline. 

What?!? That was not the way you explained it 2 months ago. Everything after that was like I woke up from a dream. I realized how everyone there were just lying about everything. The ""office"" was one of those temporary fly-by-night places with no permanent fixtures. Wall coverings and carpeting were shoddy, mis-matched, and stained. I realized that most of those who started the summer with me had stopped coming to the weekly meetings. I didn't notice when they stopped, but they had. I didn't know most of the people who were still there. Had they started after me? My main contact was my ""trainer,"" but he had moved on to training newer recruits because my training period was over. There was no one else involved, really, other than this ""trainer"" and newer and newer recruits. When the end of the summer came, the ""trainer"" made a pretty hard push to find out where everyone would be going to school (for those going to college) and new contact info for those going away to school. I decided that I would be going away to school, but didn't have my new contact info, yet. I told him I'd call him with my contact info as soon as I had it. He continued to call me for about 5 or 6 weeks. 

Never again. I was duped once, but never again. I've since learned to recognize these MLM programs much earlier.

Most, but sadly not all, can be resolved by mere diplomacy and eventual treaty. There are plenty of instances throughout history of genocide. Israel and Palestine have an ongoing dispute that is probably not ever going to be resolved in my lifetime unless one side defeats the other (via combat). How would we have negotiated an agreement with Hitler? Hey, you go ahead and stay in Europe, kill as many jews as you want, but please just don't invade any farther.

Example: A lot of Americans supported the war against Saddam Hussain and considered him a terrorist and imminent threat to the U.S. Until they didn't.

However, other ""non-slave"" states, smaller in population and size, were also in favor of the electoral college (or something like unto it). It was a compromise. Because that's what we do when we have multiple parties with differing interests. We compromise and find something that, although perhaps not 100% perfect, achieves a result that everyone is willing to accept. 

But the point still stands, a straight popular vote robs the less populated states of voice and representation. That's why we have Congress split in two - House (voice of the population) and Senate (voice of the states). The election of the President is a compromise of these two principles (voice of the population and the voice of the states). So, while yes it was the slave states who were the ones voicing concern about lack of adequate representation all those many years ago, it doesn't change the fact that a straight popular vote disenfranchises very large segments of our population. 

Are you mad that our forefathers made that compromise? Do you think the U.S. would have been better off if those slave states had never signed our constitution? Or do you think maybe the EC was fine back then, but we need something better for modern times?

I will not argue that the electoral college is perfect. I'm happy to consider alternatives. Straight popular vote is not a good alternative. When you come up with a better alternative, please note that the U.S. Constitution provides for a mechanism to change it. The Constitution has been amended before and it can be changed again. Go forth and advocate for the change you want to see, but until it gets amended, we're going to continue to abide by the rule of law. It has worked for hundreds of years and continues to work. Again, maybe not perfect, but pretty darn good the vast majority of the time. In those years when the minority doesn't get its way, at least it can't be heard to say its voice was not heard.

 

>Why stop there, in fact Trump won 100% of the popular vote if you just ignore everyone who didn't vote for him LMAO!  
>  
>Oof, this is the saddest, most cringe thing I have ever read. I'm honestly embarrassed for you.

Well, I apologize to you. Clearly, I failed to articulate my point in language you can understand because you wooshed it so completely. If you'll indulge me, I'll try again.

First, as a threshold matter, I assume that there was no voter fraud in 2016. That's a different issue, but in the absence of sufficient persuasive evidence in the alternative, I am assuming that the numbers available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election#Results_by_state) are absolutely 100% accurate. These are the numbers that I've seen frequently cited, that show Clinton with 48.18% of the popular vote (65,853,514) and Trump with 46.09% (62,984,828). According to these numbers, Clinton received 2,868,686 votes more than Trump (just shy of 3 million). Are you willing to acknowledge that it was a very close election? That there were a lot of people who actually supported and voted for Trump? (I understand if you don't like it, but if you are unwilling to acknowledge reality, then there is no point in conversing with you and your opinion is without merit.)

Second, I am not suggesting that California voters be disregarded. To the contrary, I believe everyone should go out and vote, each and every election. NOTE: All of California's 55 EC votes were cast in favor of Hillary Clinton, as they should have been.

My point: California should not be allowed to dictate to the rest of the U.S. who wins the presidential election. It isn't even about California, *per se*, it just so happens that in 2016, California was a statistical outlier. Indeed, I believe that no single state should be allowed to dictate to the rest of the U.S. who wins the presidential election - NY, TX, AK, WY, whatever. Have you ever done any rigorous study of statistics? Perhaps in an academic setting? In statistical analysis, it is very common to ignore outliers because they tend to be misleading. In 2016, California was a statistical outlier, which leads to a misleading (albeit true) statistic - that Clinton received more popular votes than Trump. Hillary Clinton was WILDLY more popular than Trump (in CA in 2016). She received very nearly 9 million votes (in CA). Trump was comparatively much less popular, receiving a little more than half of what Clinton received. But remember that Trump still received almost 4.5 million votes in CA. All of those votes were rendered moot (because of the EC). CA got its representation in the EC. All 55 votes went to Clinton. 

But if you, now, after-the-fact, now that the election is over and we have the luxury of going back and looking at popular vote numbers, want to take any solace in knowing that Clinton received more popular votes (in total) than the actual winner, Trump, fine. Go ahead and pat yourself (or your party or your candidate of choice) on the back. But just also know that that margin between Clinton and Trump *can* *be* attributable solely to one state, CA, that was a statistical anomaly at the time. The margin between Clinton and Trump was right around 2%, but if you ignore the statistical anomaly, that margin vanishes. I know it's hard, but at some point you have to come to terms with the fact that a very large number of voters actually voted for Trump. (Whether they liked it or not remains to be seen, but it doesn't matter. Their votes were cast.)

Or, stated differently, in the 2016 presidential election, CA had a disproportionate amount of Clinton votes. If we were to go by popular vote (instead of the EC), that would permit CA to have a disproportionate effect on the outcome of the election due to the disproportionate high population. If I were a big picture kind of guy, I would suggest to the Democratic party that they should strongly consider focusing their campaign efforts in those states where Trump's margin of victory was quite small and perhaps even see if they can convince some of those Clinton voters to spread out to other states. 

Nationwide, almost 8 million people voted for someone other than Trump or Clinton. What about those people? Totally ignored and unrepresented in the EC, right? They cast their votes and their votes were recorded. But their guy didn't win. I can't help but notice that 8 million is more than Clinton's margin over Trump nationwide (3 million) or in CA (4 million)."
AskReddit,fcyvbsw,t1_fcy3i2y,1578087871.0,"Well, it is how the minority avoids getting railroaded by the majority.

Yes, the Electoral College is non-partisan in that it does not *inherently* favor one party over another. All parties have equal opportunity to participate, but to be successful, participants have to reach out to and compromise with the minority. Yes, this can lead to results where 22%, who are successful in reaching out to minorities, win an election where 78% can't all agree on the opposition. (I don't know where you are getting your numbers since no candidate in the history of the U.S. has ever received votes of 78% of the population, but even if you are suggesting a hypothetical, the point stands. If one candidate receives 22% support and 8 other candidates receive 10% or less each, yes, the one with the most support gets to govern over the rest.)

For what it might be worth, I don't know if you intended it, but use of words like ""tyranny"" and ""mob rule"" are emotionally charged and do nothing to advance your argument (in the minds of those capable of critical thought). It is a cheap appeal to emotion. Totally inapplicable in this context except to the extent you are trying to evoke an emotional response. Tyranny has nothing to do with the Electoral College EXCEPT to the extent you feel that the winning party results in a cruel and oppressive government. Both parties had equal opportunity to campaign to gain the votes of the Electoral College. I am not going to argue whether Trump is or is not a tyrant. Opponents of Clinton (not synonymous with supporters of Trump) may just as well argue that the U.S. did better to avoid tyranny by not electing Hillary. (In other words, folks could just as well argue that the U.S. is less tyrannical under Trump than it would have been under Clinton.) The Electoral College neither advances nor condemns tyranny.  Like the post above, you are conflating the fact that you don't like the ultimate winner (Trump) with the process that permitted him to win (the Electoral College). The fact that you didn't get your way does not mean that the process is bad. It just means your side didn't play the game as well as the opposition. Better luck next time. ~~Maybe stop disenfranchising the minority.~~ (Sorry. That's a cheap shot emotional ploy like your use of tyranny and mob rule. Ignore that.)

Your use of ""mob rule"" is even more misplaced. The EC was implement to avoid mob rule. If you don't like mob rule, you should be a fan of the EC. You're not. Those who advocate for elimination of the EC in favor of a straight popular vote are the ones advocating for mob rule. The only difference between ""mob rule"" and ""rule by popular vote"" is the emotionally charged context. If you disagree, then please help me understand the difference."
AskReddit,fcvta5w,t1_fcvmr1i,1578009605.0,"You may be right. But was 2016 predicted to be close? I seem to recall it being predicted as a landslide for Clinton. There was just no way that Trump could win. Anecdotally, a lot of folks I know tell me they didn't vote in 2016. The general consensus was that it was a forgone conclusion and ""my vote won't matter."" Possible many of them are unwilling to admit who they voted for, I suppose. Point is, I don't think people actually know whether an election is going to be close or landslide until after the fact.

AskReddit,fcvgotj,t1_fcv0zqs,1578001717.0,"First, it is a very rare occurrence. Go back a little farther. Since 1828, it has happened exactly [4 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin) (out of 48 elections). Yes, highly unusual that it would happen twice in recent history, but all that shows is that the country was (is) highly divided. Lots of support on both sides. No landslide wins. 

Second, the margin of victory is (and arguably must be) quite low to experience this phenomenon. In 2016, the margin was -2.09% (just shy of 3 million votes for Clinton over Trump). In 2000, the margin was -0.51% (just over half a million votes for Gore over Bush).  Note also that in both elections that Bill Clinton won (1992 and 1996), he did not receive a majority of the popular vote. 

The election of the President was never intended to be a popular vote. The EC was set up to prevent the very populace states from dominating the rest of the country. You may argue that perhaps it *should* be a strict popular vote, but that's not the same as saying the EC works in theory, but not in practice. To the contrary, the EC is working EXACTLY as intended. 

&#x200B;

> My issue is that it has chosen a candidate the majority of Americans voted against twice in the last 20 years. The loser won. 

Nope. That's not true. A majority of Americans did not cast a vote in favor of Trump in 2016, but that's not the same as casting a vote against. It is misleading to count the nearly 40% of eligible voters who stayed home in 2016 as votes in opposition. It would be more accurate to say more people voted for Clinton than Trump in 2016. You could even say that Clinton was more popular than Trump (empirically, based on votes cast). But it doesn't matter because we do not elect the President via popular vote. Never have. And the respective campaign strategies reflect this fact both then and now. In other words, if we ever do switch to a popular vote, the campaigns will be run very differently. For what it might be worth, by all accounts Clinton raised and spent about (or nearly) twice as much money as Trump. She *should* have won. Trump was the underdog in the 2016 campaign. I, for one, am glad that an underdog can still win and money does not (completely) buy an election. (I'm also glad he isn't getting everything he wants and is running into a lot of pushback, but that's a whole other issue.)

California does not determine the President for the rest of the country. In 2016, Clinton's margin over Trump, just in California, was over 4 million votes. [Scroll to middle or so of this long post for a handy chart of results by state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election). Remember, nationwide the margin was less than 3 million votes (or about 2%). Disregard that one state and Trump wins both the popular vote and the EC. Moreover, there were just shy of 1 million voters in CA who voted for neither Clinton nor Trump. So in California, there are at least 5 million more people who did not vote for Trump than those who did vote for Trump. Not being a resident of CA, my response is, so what? I don't care that Clinton was wildly popular there. 

All the candidates knew the ""rules of the game."" The EC is not new. Both major parties (and all of the newcomers, independents, etc.) know what is required to win the Presidential election. Hillary Clinton did not win what she set out to win in 2016. Al Gore did not win what he set out to win in 2000. In both those years, neither of those losers (not meant as an insult) set out to win the popular vote. Because popular vote doesn't matter.

If your complaint is that the EC doesn't elect the person that YOU wanted to be president and you view that as a failure, then that's not really a failure in practice or theory. That's just you didn't get what you wanted. 

If your complaint is that the EC is somehow inherently ""not fair"" or ""not in agreement with the popular vote,"" then that is a complaint that it does not work in theory, and any past elections where the EC did result in ""fair"" or ""aligned with popular vote"" are mere coincidence."
AskReddit,fcuzxra,t1_fcutj95,1577991841.0,"> we don't even choose our president 

That's just not true. U.S. citizens have many opportunities to choose the president. From the primaries to the general election, we have several opportunities to cast a vote. Yes, the presidential race is not a popular vote, but it is a representative democracy. We cast our vote (which gets recorded) and then we send representatives to cast a vote for the President on our behalf. That's intentional. A feature, not a bug. 

Our laws (on the federal level) are also enacted (or repealed) by representative democracy. We do not submit (federal) laws to a popular vote (to be ratified by a majority of the population). Again, like the election for the office of the President, that is intentional. 

Pure democracy in all governing, submitting every governmental action to a popular vote of the masses,  has not been tried on a scale comparable to the United States (to my knowledge). Nor should it. 

If you object to the electoral college (which only happens for ONE vote every four years), do you also object to the election of representatives in Congress, who cast multiple votes per year on your behalf? Having senators and representatives in Congress represent your interests is really not all that different from sending a designee to the electoral college to elect the President.  

Incidentally,

> we vote for senators and representatives, who then go on to be part of the electoral college 

This is not true, either. Indeed, a person who is currently serving as an elected member of the Senate or House of Representatives is PROHIBITED from also serving as a member of the electoral college. (See Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution). This gets glossed over by so many people it is easy to miss. The NUMBER of votes in the EC is the same as the NUMBER of senators and representatives, but the actual persons casting the votes in the EC are not your senators and reps. The selection of EC electors varies from state to state, but generally they are chosen by the candidate or the political party. When you cast your vote in the general election (for the President), you are voting to determine which set of EC electors your state will send to the EC. It doesn't really matter the names of those EC electors because we all know how they are going to vote. Some are bound (by law) to vote according to the popular vote within their state. Others are not bound (by law), but are bound by pledge to their party. In some instances, it may be possible (in theory) for an EC elector to go rogue and vote differently. Some folks were encouraging EC electors to do just that in 2016, to not actually cast their EC ballot for Trump. Obviously, it didn't happen. In practice, it would be extremely difficult/rare for an EC elector to cast any ballot other than what is expected. This is why we can know the election results within hours after the polls close, rather than waiting until the EC actually meets and casts their votes (in December)."

Its like I have this feeling like they might be the one stuck in a real life version of Groundhog Day and my pointing it out to them is the only thing that will break them free. I usually try to shrug it off as silly. *Everyone* is familiar with Groundhog Day. They would know it if they were stuck reliving the same day over and over again. But then somehow my logic convinces me that it must be pointed out to them by a third party in order to ""break the spell"" so to speak.

This has happened to me probably 8 or 10 times. Not once was the person actually stuck in a Groundhog Day situation.

I suppose it really depends on what you're trying to get out of an argument. When I'm scrolling along, I love reading both sides of an argument. If I saw one argumentator respond to a thorough, well-thought-out, multi-point, logical comment with something to the effect of what you just wrote, I would perceive that as a point in the other guy's favor. You just lost the argument.

Its like when I tell my kid that its time for bed and they respond with, ""OK Boomer."" We both think its funny, but for different reasons. They think its the greatest comeback of all time. Even though I'm not a boomer, it doesn't matter because my kid doesn't understand what a boomer is. I hear it as a concession that they have nothing of substance left to argue and we both know they're going to do as I say. The negotiation has ended and I have ""won.""

Do you think it is a good thing to piss off people that you are arguing with? Do you view that as a ""win""? To me, anyone who responds with ""i didn't read your argument and i won't respond to it"" sounds like you just lost the argument. That kind of response sounds like the angry, emotional, illogical one.  I mean, if they were genuinely interested in engaging in dialog and idea exchange with you, and you throw cold water on the dialog and just shut the whole thing down like that, that sounds like you have no meaningful response. Your response really is fairly insulting and short-sighted, IF your intent is to actually have a meaningful debate or idea exchange about a particular topic or with a particular person. But I understand that some people just want to exchange barbs online. If that's your goal, hey you sure got a great (meaningless) zinger going for you there. U mad?

I don't engage in online argumentation very often. There's too many people who think like you (and lack critical thinking skills). But when I do engage online, I argue for the benefit of the audience (those who read the comment string later). I could not care less whether the other arguer is persuaded. Bonus points if they actually engage and make valid points (and I am happy to concede points and give credit where credit is due).
