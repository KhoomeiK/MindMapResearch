Giraffes- for some reason this has been a giraffy xmas. Everyone gifted my baby nephew giraffe themed stuff without expecting it, even the wrapping paper! And nobody planned it! So itâ€™s now a cute memento. :)

Arctic Animals: like whales and bears... they make me remember a screening in an animation festival I was volunteering as a translator. So much fun!! Also lemurs and zebras bring me really fond memories of my favorite chilean comic I read as a kid. It was about a boy who could travel through time and space and have adventures with his caveman friend."

What Iâ€™ve seen is that people love receiving non-generic messages. Some people love sharing random facts, poems, stories, thoughts, drawings etc.

Thereâ€™s also the hojarasca cake. A classic here. Need a rolling pin for that one. You make this thin, really thin layers of... of... shoot I donâ€™t have the vocabulary!  Dough? Bake them till theyâ€™re crunchy and cover them in manjar too. I mean, dulce de leche. Let them sit for a whole day so the flavors soak in. So goood.


Edit: and also whiped cream or strawberry jam in between. Sooo goood."

These are my favorite cakes: 
https://tpriesco.cl/collections/tortas

And the secret is hidden on how you moist the layers and the choise of ingredients. Once I made one with butter instead of margarine, some nice liquors and real chocolate and it was orgasmic.

We have these more frequently that those made with fondant. So good."
RandomActsofCards,fc4gd3a,t1_fc4g1lc,1577415868.0,Awesome! Always try going for the... erm... less liquid versions of it when making cakes.

Would you like that recipe? You need a mould of course... do you have one for cakes? You can also freeze it and leave it for later."

RandomActsofCards,fc4cr7l,t1_fc492th,1577412905.0,"Itâ€™s a 3 layered 3 leches with dulce de leche between them. And all covered in meringe.

[hereâ€™s a recipe, though I usually do a more complicated one](https://www.chileanfoodandgarden.com/tres-leches-cake-chilean-recipe/) 


And this is a version of the Cielo (heaven ) cake. It has layers of baked meringe, like a pavlova in between. [an old classic here](https://www.chileanfoodandgarden.com/cielo-heaven-cake/) 


And [hereâ€™s an easy mil hojas.](https://www.chileanfoodandgarden.com/easy-mil-hojas-cake/)  I usually go for the really hard annoying version too, it can be soooo good when done well. This type of cake is also an old time favorite down here. They taste better after 3 days in the fridge.



Edit: for the 3 leches I usually use an old vainilla sponge cake recipe... those that you donâ€™t even need baking powders and that kind of stuff, and then cut it in 3 pieces. Actually any flexible spongy dense sponge cake could work. Just devide, add 1/3 of the milks mix, add the dulce de leche in between, cover in meringe and let it sit for a day to make it taste even better."

Duuude, like woah, you went insane this year! So much love and commitment poured into this!  You deserve the best offer award, it was so fun participating in this, and even if it had been for a much, much smaller offer, I actually loved getting to know more about the awesome peeps this sub has the most.

I have this Hojarasca Mil hojas cake with dulce de leche, or these cakes with like 12  thin layers of ganache and other fillings, like nutella, or strawberries or nuts and dulce de leche... or a cake that mixes pavlova with spongecake layers and awesomeness. 

Or the all time hit: 4 leches cake. So awesome and spongy and moist. Iâ€™m too lazy to upload on imgur the pics, but oh gosh, message me on Ig if you wanna discuss diabetes inducing recipes."

Iâ€™m so glad you liked it! I was worried youâ€™ll find it boring because it kinda just said Magic Kingdom and some people send Disney stuff that is sooo cool. But that postcard was really special for me anyway, since the red stripes moved ( dunno how that effect is called), had some characters I liked and somehow was able to get it in my overwhelmed state xD . I wonder if next time I visit Iâ€™ll be overwhelemed as well. Wanna get Stitch stuff, lol, but thereâ€™s so so so many I canâ€™t choose and end up with anything at the end, haha.

I actually got overwhelemed everywhere, lol, even at Wallgreens or Samâ€™s club. Soo biiiig ðŸ˜µ I remember the car rental lady being horror strucked when we didnâ€™t ask for a â€œnever lostâ€... we wouldnâ€™t even know how to use it anyway... and we got lost. That was 10 years ago xD Had so much fun, Iâ€™d love traveling there again.

Though the last years we didnâ€™t even change and dad would throw us without changing. Even the dog ends up inside, though he doesnâ€™t like it."
