Leica,fcwgg42,t1_fcvuj27,1578024983.0,"Well it’s certainly a look on the digital camera, but the lack of contrast and flare issues do make it a little unpredictable. That said, yes I loved it on my M6, I’ve used it on that camera for more than 30 years...."

news,fcmvo2p,t1_fcmgc41,1577794411.0,"Really. And how do the people that create the news get paid then? Guess what, when the news industry was its most healthy, lucrative even, everybody had to pay for it. There was no free unless you picked-up a paper off the floor of the subway or somewhere. Do you work for free? How about we all come to your place of work and get you to do whatever it is you do, but for us, and for free."
Instagram,fclejid,t3_ehosmy,1577745964.0,"It already is, just not for you. IG sells your feed, and everyone else’s to advertisers who pay for sponsored posts. And all the dumb users fill it up with free content for them to put between the ads. 
Of course the infrastructure costs (servers, bandwidth) must be enormous...why do you think they curate the feeds now? They show 1/10 the content they used to, so that saves them lots of cash while at the same time serving up more and more ads."
photography,fcla6x9,t1_fcl8zeq,1577743162.0,"I’m not sure disabling your account is going to help with keeping followers. Going silent in any way is going to cost you, but that’s a bit of a whatever. I’ve severely cut back on posting at all the last year and change. I’ve lost about 2500 followers, but I was losing them slowly anyway. The IG algorithm is not kind to accounts like mine."
news,fcja3i8,t1_fcisupz,1577681065.0,"No, the real issue is people thinking somehow this should be free. How exactly do you think the people who report get paid if you won’t pay for it? Newspapers are getting pennies on the dollar for ad revenue they used to get. Without people paying for it, the industry will whither and die, just like it is in the process of doing. 
How are you going to go to a sister with when they all fold up? I’m sure you’ll enjoy Karen’s political analysis on Facebook."

Edited to remove 80 per cent ad revenue comment, it’s actually 60 per cent of all US ad revenue that they get."
photography,fcip6f2,t3_ehdgg7,1577666540.0,"Curious why you’d bother deactivating your account rather than just let it lay dormant? From the number of posts I see from people saying they can’t reactivate their account seems to me just letting sleep is far better than putting it in a coffin and hoping you can resurrect it later. If you are going to kill it, so be it just do it."
bernesemountaindogs,fciboa2,t3_ehb4zk,1577660194.0,"Ha ha, Berners are all the same I guess. My girl gets totally stubborn too when she doesn’t want a walk to end."
bernesemountaindogs,fcg3x0u,t3_eh6z3c,1577636299.0,"We looked at a few factors: How many litters a year does the breeder do and how many dogs do they have? Are they registered Kennel Club breeders, for how long. Recommendations from previous buyers, do they offer health guarantees, what does their no-breeding contract read like, what do they do to provide good lineage? How strongly do they vet their clients? Are the pups raised under-foot in a home? How open are they to you visiting? How much of a business is this for them as opposed to something they do for the love of the breed? Are they involved in the Berner community?
We chose a small local breeder who is a high-ranking judge for shows, only has a couple of litters a year, has been a kennel club registered breeder for over 25 years, raises pups in the home. She also has a very strong non-breeding contract to help prevent improper breeding. Our pup’s mom is local from Ontario, whom we were able to meet, but her dad was from a Hungarian breeder. And she was totally open to us coming to visit the pups any time after they were born. As it turns out we only went once when they were four weeks, but we could have gone every weekend if we wanted. 
Due diligence is really important. With a proper breeder you’re going to have to wait. Chances are if a breeder has many pups available if you contact them, they are churning them out. You don’t want that. For a couple of reasons we waited six months for our pup after deciding on the breeder."
Instagram,fc6y2dn,t3_egiqcw,1577492450.0,"You have a lot of really repetitive posts, okay we get it, you go to the gym and have a good body. And? You can’t post the same photo over and over and get traction. You gotta really mix it up. Look at women who have similar ‘look at me’ accounts (no judgement there btw, but that’s what your account is), look at how the successful ones work to find new ways of doing the same thing. Their advantage is they generally are modelling some sort of clothing or something...you’re taking pics in the locker room a lot of the time. Which I think also probably violates your club’s rules too..."
bernesemountaindogs,fc6x6xv,t3_egh3rc,1577491805.0,"My Berner’s littermate sister by fluke ended up living a few blocks away. The first time they ran into each other, they were probably about 13 weeks or so old, so had not seen each other for about 5 weeks. I can’t say there was any long lost sister love, I think there was the same excitement any puppy would have for another puppy. But over time, we see them every now and then, the other owner has commented that for sure their dog reacts to our dog differently than other dogs. They do seem very comfortable with each other, they play pretty instantly rather than having a sniffing get-acquainted moment. But still, I think maybe there is some breed recognition (hey, you’re like me), but family recognition I think is
just our wishful thinking because it would be so cute."
