thisismylifenow,fep9ako,t1_fep95dn,1579315020.0,"Man I don’t know how you do it, my frames got crooked when someone sat on them and they never feel the same, I’m always insecure because they’re everrrr so slightly off."
thisismylifenow,fep8x5s,t1_fep777z,1579314779.0,I also need to know this.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzrgkx,t1_fdzqzo4,1578794072.0,"Imma be frank, I’d never do that with my dog. I’m not one of those entitled fucks that thinks my dog belongs everywhere and anywhere. But at the same time if someone shoves my dog for any reason they’re gonna get it. You just don’t do that. If someone shoved my bag or stuff or anything off a seat they’re getting it and my stance on this isn’t isolated to me. Anybody I know or respect would answer hands with hands."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzo03n,t1_fdznsc8,1578792270.0,The NYPD disagrees. They said it was a service dog and are there is no punitive action in that direction.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdznoww,t1_fdzmza9,1578792101.0,"Dog was defending its owner. Fault was with the idiot that put her hands on the dog in the first place. When you touch someone else’s property, you invite them to reciprocate your physical violation. I don’t understand your worldview, are we as people supposed to let people push our pets around because they have a different opinion? And are our dogs supposed to be utterly useless in an altercation? They’re dogs, not cats, goldfish, or chickens. They are meant to defend, protect, guard. I just don’t understand why everyone should just roll over in your vision of the world."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzm5sb,t1_fdzlsam,1578791586.0,"Of my understanding, that’s something that can be asked from an establishment, or a person can volunteer that information. I don’t think it’s our business if they don’t want to share. Look, if your owner gets into a brawl after some lady shoved you twice and you don’t bite her, you’re not a dog, you’re a stuffed animal that costs money to maintain. It’s like we’re forgetting what a dog is for."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzl87q,t1_fdzklj7,1578791250.0,Service dog. Verified by the NYPD.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzek1r,t1_fdzecqr,1578789471.0,Maybe this maybe that maybe put your hands on my dog and it’s teeth would be the least of your worries.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdzc6z8,t1_fdz43ok,1578788731.0,Lady got into fight with owner because lady shoved dog twice. Also you know there’s quite a larger pool of disabilities other than blindness
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdz9ikc,t1_fdwi7r2,1578787951.0,Lady put her hands on the dog and then on the owner.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdz9feu,t1_fdwnvto,1578787919.0,Her kicking at the dog is what got this started.
wokekids,fdque1o,t1_fdqrwj1,1578675053.0,"I don’t think teaching kindness can outdo mental illness. Be it the pressures of our technologically advanced society that our organic brains cannot keep up with, or how disconnected we are, or mental illness on the rise, there are issues that “kindness” cannot solve. So many aspects of a child’s media and upbringing often do focus on kindness. One interesting thing I discovered is that the majority of these school shooters have a weak father figure. I sometimes theorize that boys who don’t grow up with a mentor to teach them how to manage their anger and completely normal emotions will present them in abnormal, harmful ways."
wokekids,fdqghz4,t1_fdqgd2r,1578666079.0,"But when it does happen, it’ll obliterate everything that parent has and will ever have. That’s too high of a percentage for most people."
wokekids,fdqdzen,t1_fdq2xvl,1578664169.0,"Oh fuck off. These are children. People. They should be alive right now, not mercilessly gunned down in a school. People are right to be scared, they imagine loosing their child like this and it hurts them deeply."

On another hand, it’s also going to be easier for them to plan and ambush in the future if they see where I live. I’m a women by myself and in that moment I hated making that choice."
