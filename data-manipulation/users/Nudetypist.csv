You know what else is highly unusual, just getting a high payout for a renter to move out. Unusual clauses happen in unusual situations. You have a developer that could sell 50 apartments for $5 million dollars each, contingent upon this one renter leaving. They also already have a construction loan that's incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars of interest each month.
