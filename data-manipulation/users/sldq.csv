Getting married in your teenage years is still incredibly early, and the odds that you and your husband will still be married in 10 years aren’t that high. Regardless of the financial aid, I would not advice anyone to get married this early.

Look, no matter which way you spin it, getting married at 18 is a bad idea. I think deep down even you know it, or else you wouldn’t be clamoring for opinions from random people on the internet. If youre having any doubts whatsoever about getting married, you shouldn’t be getting married. And you’re very obviously having some doubts.

I know for example if you want to get a job or internship with the Big Four accounting firms, above a 3.0 is a must. Now obviously you can still be successful without getting a job at those companies, but plenty of jobs definitely do still care about your gpa."

If you did it, it would work providing the marriage is legitimate and all that (as far as my knowledge goes, I’m no FAFSA expert). It’s just an incredibly dumb thing to do. 

Don’t do it, and quit entertaining the idea. Follow that advice and you’ll thank me in 5 years."

Most people I know had multiple answers left blank after their first test, or they had to guess on quite a lot because they ran out of time. 60 math questions in 60 minutes is no joke. Reading is also a sore spot for many.  Be warned."

Yes, there are proficiency exams you can take to get credit for the class/language. All that is going to depend highly on the community college and university  you’re planning to transfer to. Reach out to them directly for a more accurate answer."
ApplyingToCollege,fgh4xco,t1_fgh3d5o,1580776782.0,"That’s not true at all. If a college says they accept both and view both equally, then that’s the truth. This myth that colleges say the tests are equal but then secretly value the SAT more has been perpetrated on this sub since I’ve been here. I don’t know where it comes from, but there’s not a shred of evidence behind it and the rumor needs to stop spreading around. **Colleges do not secretly value the SAT over the ACT, people.**

> Also since it’s more common, there tends to be more resources available to study for it, which also contributes to the SAT kinda solidifying as the go-to standardized test. 

This is more of a regional phenomena. Where I’m from in the Midwest, ACT is king. Most people don’t even bother taking the SAT unless they’re forced to. ACT prep classes, tutoring, etc is everywhere but SAT resources are much less abundant. SAT may be the go-to on the east coast, but it’s not that way everywhere."

ApplyingToCollege,fggjj2m,t3_eydnkp,1580763183.0,"Why is everyone so stressed over likely letters? I wouldn’t worry about it OP. They are super, SUPER rare, even at the few schools that do routinely send them out. 

You have to be truly exceptional for a college of UChicago’s caliber to take the time to personally write and send you a likely letter. The odds of anyone on this sub individually getting accepted to any of these T20 schools is already incredibly slim. The odds of any one individual here getting a likely letter is so slim I’m not sure why you all spend so much time thinking it will happen. 

It’s like walking around your house asking every family member you encounter what the winning lottery numbers were for the night before. Just wait and find out on your own.
