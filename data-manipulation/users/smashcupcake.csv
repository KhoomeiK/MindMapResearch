Perhaps I’ve had underwear stolen often enough to remove the shock value."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdlpxsh,t3_elww9o,1578529694.0,I understand the movie “The Birds” on a whole new level.

YouOnLifetime,fdkt5je,t1_fdkt0ds,1578510618.0,I don’t think so... I remember bring shocked when they showed it in his box.  After all he’s done that’s the moment I decided he was CRAZY.
YouOnLifetime,fdkpetl,t1_fdkm0wj,1578508395.0,I feel like everyone skated past that. I couldn’t let that ride.

bipolar,fct62rj,t1_fcmop61,1577933829.0,"Evidently some bipolar people are more susceptible than others, but it can cause mania. For me they actually caused a psychotic break."
agedlikemilk,fckx78h,t1_fckwss5,1577735122.0,Even more impressive

bipolar,fck5dnk,t1_fck4qpo,1577717070.0,"I love love my doctors. I mean, obviously I have a sensitivity to antihistamines, but like I said, she was pretty matter of fact about it like it was completely common.  I’ve only tried one type since then that was recommended online and honestly it made me angry so I’ve avoided them since."
bipolar,fck0k7k,t1_fck0b0a,1577712795.0,Thanks. I’m new to this and had no idea how completely different everyone’s symptoms and reactions are.
bipolar,fcjy8y3,t3_ehldvj,1577710260.0,It was actually Benedryl that lead to me being diagnosed. Took some that was sold as a sleep aid after a stressful day and ended up in a full blown psychotic break. My Doctor said that pretty much all over the counter cold/flu/allergy meds should be avoided as if that were bipolar 101 info.
bipolar,fcjx77h,t1_fcjx172,1577708982.0,"I know As bipolar I can’t take antihistamines and wondered if eye drops count. I tried to google and all I could find is that steroid eye drops are not wise - wondering if that applies to the antihistamine ones as well. 
I’m having an allergic reaction to a cat and my eyes is swollen and oozing yellow crap AND today my boyfriend is taking me out of state to meet his family. Best timing ever."
90DayFiance,f6xslb1,t1_f6wyegf,1573257343.0,That’s why he’s still dating Maria. He’s too legit to quit.
