They went to the big major corporations who gave them cheaper products, despite the quality having gone down, and even in some cases making people sick over a longer period, because prior healthy and fresh ingredients has been swapped for cheap alternates. Still people will support the major corporations, because they'll save a dollar or two.

Please understand that the Destiny 2 engine, is a re-modded engine (from the 2000s) from originally like 1998.

This is hardcore technological facts that cannot be disputed.

Bungie has to shell out a lot of money to make a new engine, or at least hardcode Dedicated Servers for their matchmaking, or this issue will persist for ever.

Unfortunately I personally believe that Bungie will not even think of dedicated servers for Destiny 3, or even their new engine, because they ultimately care more about Console than they do any other platforms, because Consoles are the easiest platform to make games for where you can down-tone everything as much as possible (requires the least amount of skill and technical talent)."

What you're saying might not be controversial in which-ever non-educated circles you dwell in, but in the real world, actual facts, documents, recordings, videos, they all make evidence which all speaks to the contrary of all your opinions.

Show us just one actual piece of paper, any recording, anything that would support your notion, from anything other than some ""random"" person having an opinion about it, from a blog, or book or whatever. You can't. Have fun googling for hours trying to find something that isn't from a wordpress blog or book with no sources."

Messiah,fdvfbln,t1_fdu14xp,1578746800.0,"The show is what it is, critics being corrupt and taking bribes and not writing any honest reviews a month, perhaps 1 or 2 of their general reviews are truthful, and these wouldn't be about the AAA movies.

The accusation is very appropriate, I work in the contractor industry and have come across my fair share of ""journalists"" and writers who certainly did not only write the truth, or what they thought, they write depending on who they are friends which, which company they belong to, who sends them most gifts or invites them to most parties. This isn't anything new, or even radical, it's quite common and has been like this for about two decades.

**Messiah as a show, it's great, but it isn't super award worthy, it could win an award, sure, but it wouldn't take all the prizes in a contest, we all know that it has issues.**

Still doesn't change the fact that most critics are corrupt, this includes the self-employed freelance YouTube reviewers. 

Perhaps you don't know how advertising work, but obviously these major huge production companies will use any means to push their services, including criminal and degrading acts such as corruption.

No amount of self-pity from critics will save them from this fact. Screenrant, and who ever can keep posting as many articles as they want about how they're don't have corrupt critics, but we all know that they do.

Plus the fact that a lot of critics don't have any talent, and shouldn't be writing reviews in the first place, since the only way they can attract viewership to their magazine/site/blog, is to write negative reviews where they trash something niche, or something safe (for them to trash) - they would never trash something that would net them a mainstream hatred, this only happens if they do reviews PRIOR to people having had a chance to see whatever it is they're reviewing. For example take The Witcher season 1, where a lot of reviews were out really fast that trashed the show, and now it's Number 1.

**Critics are people who cannot get real jobs.**

Being a film/movie critic isn't a job, it's a hobby."
