Anyways OP yes you can reset all hordes once you kill them all. The opportunities for rematches are infinite. Great feature of the game IMO."

I’m in a similar boat. We did a road trip to Seattle in it week one, and then it sat at 30 all the way down...but in a hilly area with lots of stop signs and lights, in the cold...I’m getting 5-10 right now. 

Still, I fill half the tank every couple of weeks so it ain’t so bad!"
DaysGone,fen9d7u,t1_fekrndx,1579279811.0,"Honestly, I would give them a few more tries. I sucked ass at first and it made me wonder how I got through the main game, but as of last night I have about 60% of the patches unlocked and all but one ring. Mind you they’re all bronze, but a bit of practice helped me a lot!"
Witcher3,femyds3,t1_femvb1g,1579272785.0,"Honestly it’s worth it. The game is quite long, I’ll give you that, but the emotional impact near the end is quite significant."

DaysGone,fek88vl,t1_fek7wvq,1579194664.0,"Honestly I just started messing with them last night but there are endless hordes, endless waves of bandits, some racing modes of a sort...and you earn rewards which can be used in the main game! I think I'm going to do as much as I can with them, and then eventually start a NG+ run. Seems like the way to do it!

I'm being very pleasantly surprised by how much I'm getting out of this game."
DaysGone,fek7dxi,t1_fejtvg4,1579194150.0,"Yep. Plus it’s honestly refreshing to see someone not just swim along with 40lbs of guns on their back. It always bugs me a bit that characters can just swim along with armor / swords / guns on.

Besides which with the size of the team and what they accomplished with this game, I don’t feel like I need to be able to swim at all. 

Also...can you imagine how terrifying zombies in the water would be? That’s a big fat nope from me."
DaysGone,fejntf5,t3_epizjg,1579181073.0,I also feel like and idiot for not buying it at launch at this point. Have you tried any of the challenge modes yet? They’re quite fun on their own!

DaysGone,fedvrq4,t1_fedvczn,1579020928.0,"Yeah that’s kinda where I’m at, I just have the last mission to go south and take out the Colonel left, and I’ve been clearing hordes because I don’t want to end the story.
