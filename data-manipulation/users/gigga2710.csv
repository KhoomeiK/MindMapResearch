dogs,ffd2o23,t1_ffclbq7,1579812221.0,"Great advice. I was overwhelmed at my first dog show experience and I didn’t know what to say or when to approach people. I still don’t really know honestly! Any suggestions for starting a conversation or when the best time to do so might be? I’d like to make it to one of the “meet the breed” shows because I think that’d be a perfect place to talk to breeders. 

But I’m not terribly far from Ocala so thank you for letting me know!! I’ll see if I can make it this weekend."
dogs,ffd1t6a,t1_ffcj5nq,1579811737.0,Thank you!
dogs,ffd1qzq,t1_ffcon7v,1579811704.0,"Thank you! Do you think the age and cause of death is something breeders will willingly divulge? I’ve never had that conversation with a breeder before. But its a great point and I agree, it’s something that would be very important to know. I want to be as tactful and respectful as I can while still getting what I’m looking for."
dogs,ffd0x8d,t1_ffcpbe7,1579811242.0,"Thank you! You bring up some excellent points. 

I have a book on dog structure and judging that I’m just starting to dig into. And I’ve read the Golden Retriever standard but I know I’m no where near knowledgeable enough to identify which dogs, out of the breeders I linked to, are the best representations of the breed. I think going to some more shows will be beneficial. I know I like the *look* of the blockier heads and full coats. I’m not into the goldens with narrow faces and shorter fur. More specific than that though and I just don’t really know! But I will absolutely go to the Golden National, thank you for letting me know about it! 

I’m lucky to have a dog club near me that offers conformation classes and from what I hear, has good connections in the showing community. I’m hoping with the help of a mentor and these classes, I’ll be able to get started."
dogs,ffcjstt,t1_ffcid7t,1579800969.0,"Thank you, I actually already have a rescue dog and I’m really wanting to get into conformation.  I also enjoy dog sports like dock diving and agility. I’m sure many rescue dogs can do sports but I want to be sure the dog I get is structurally sound and healthy. My dog has some medical issues that weren’t apparent when I adopted him and unfortunately it limits what he can do."
dogs,ffcio31,t1_ffci9s3,1579800286.0,"Are hips, heart and elbows done once or annually? 

Thank you for your input! I didn’t realize she was on the goldenretrieverforum, that’s awesome (that’s where I found these breeders!). I really want to go with someone who is seriously passionate about bettering the breed."
dogs,ffcib0x,t1_ffcguyi,1579800065.0,"Thank you very much! I will definitely ask about NCL testing. 
I hope I’m right on this but aren’t you very active in the golden community? What would you look for in a dog’s temperament that would make you say yay or nay? If I can meet the adults before I make a final decision and I want to know what I should look for."
dogs,ffchk4u,t1_ffcf8ir,1579799609.0,"Her website stood out to me too but the quality of her dogs is what I care about most. What kind of DNA testing? I know these breeders get their dogs eyes, heart and hips tested but I didn’t see anything about DNA tests."
dogs,ffchdga,t1_ffcfvo1,1579799494.0,"What is the benefit of a hobby kennel in your opinion? 

I’d like to have a close working relationship with the breeder I choose, especially if I can actually get a show prospect puppy. I’d really need a mentor. But I’m not sure how to “get my foot in the door” so to speak. I know the show community is very competitive and I know ethical breeders want to be selective with who they sell their puppies too."
dogs,ffch1uk,t1_ffcfvkj,1579799296.0,"Thank you, thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. Would it be appropriate for me to ask Gemini Goldens why they no longer title their female dogs? 
Also, is it common for breeders to allow people to come and meet their adult dogs before I put down a deposit?  I don’t want to step on any toes and I want to build a good relationship with the breeder."
dogs,fedtyp0,t1_fe9ms49,1579019838.0,"Is every dog that attacks other animals or people abused/trained to do so? Of course not. 

Genetics has an enormous influence over an animal’s temperament. Several breeds of dogs were bred and *still are* bred for “gameness.” I encourage you to look up the term and how it relates to some breeds being more genetically predisposed to aggression than others."
dogs,feaklqh,t3_eo5ud3,1578949909.0,"Totally feel your pain. 

My dog, although calm and polite with other dogs when properly introduced, will get very upset when off-leash dogs charge us and get in his face. I can’t even blame him. Most of the dogs that charge us are really poorly socialized.

Don’t be afraid to keep gearing up! I see you carry some deterrents already - just be sure to have it in reach! I learned the hard way that having it on my person is not the same thing as being able to use it... I have a Doggie Don’t Device, pepper spray, and citronella spray in my fanny pack. In risky areas I keep one in my hand while we walk.

One tip I heard recently is to scream that your dog has kennel cough/some other infectious disease. Haven’t tried it yet though."
dogs,fdbx76q,t1_fdbuuxr,1578263333.0,"I’m so sorry that happened to you. At least you could pick your dog up...I’m only 5’1 and about 110lbs. The only thing I could do is kick. 

That is great that your dog is okay! My dog was very insecure and had some difficult dog reactivity that we spent a year working on. He is well balanced and non reactive now but I fear one attack could send us back to square one."
dogs,fdbv5bb,t1_fdbmxk3,1578262454.0,"Thanks! Sometimes I feel like no one else even realizes that other dogs aren’t always friendly! 
Breed definitely impacts my wariness but honestly, I’m pretty cautious around any medium to large dog that’s overly excited, barking, or pulling their owners around.  I saw a golden retriever and GSP fight viciously before. The golden had several wounds on its legs from what I could see."
dogs,fdbh73o,t1_fdbcj68,1578257370.0,"What do you mean “that dog owner?” 

But I hear ya. It’s just I’ve seen some very persistent dogs in the past that do not quit trying to fight even after being sprayed in the face. That’s what I’m most worried about."
dogs,fdb2kom,t1_fdb14dl,1578253045.0,Bullshit that I carry all of those deterrents? Or that I’m afraid all the time? Lol. Both are true sadly.
dogs,fb2m5h9,t3_eaytyb,1576453558.0,"E-collars are great. Only people that don’t know how to use them can screw up their dog. But that’s the same as any training style or tool. You gotta know what you’re doing.

I’m a huge proponent of positive reinforcement, counter conditioning and slowly adding distractions during all types of training.  *That said,* nothing can compete with the compulsion of an ecollar. I have recalled my dog off of a herd of deer MID-CHASE! I can recall him off of raccoons, possums, and dogs at any distance. It’s instant, and essentially 100% reliable once properly introduced and trained.

Get yourself a Mini Educator brand ecollar and watch as much Larry Krohn videos on YouTube as you can. Definitely check out r/opendogtraining too as someone already suggested. 

**But remember: Do NOT use the collar to “correct” or punish your dog. It is an attention grabbing, redirection tool.**"
