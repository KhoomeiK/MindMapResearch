Bond is the audience surrogate and an iconic character with over 20 films, it's far more difficult to change things without backlash. 

Without getting into the fact that the Bond character is effectively only defined by his Masculinity and any changes would need to be fairly extreme to be believeable, particularly given the series is ostensibly set in the real world. 

There are plenty of characters in fiction where their gender is an irrelevance, Doctor Who is a good example but Bond is not one of them, his entire character is built off of being essentially a Male power fantasy. 

Broccoli has the right of it, they should create new characters and stories rather than clumsily retrofitting existing ones, it's less likely to offend the existing audience and if it takes off now you have an entirely new property to capitalise on.
