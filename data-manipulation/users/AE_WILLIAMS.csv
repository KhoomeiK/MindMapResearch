Coupled with the ubiquity of smartphones and other devices, the public school system stands as the epitome of an archaic, antiquated and outmoded model for education.

I imparted more useful information by suggesting people read Gatto and Llewellyn than any school administrator has done in their entire career of poisoning young minds at the expense of critical thinking."
explainlikeimfive,ffwqzog,t1_ffwoxa4,1580308896.0,"I will tell you something, my friend.

I don't just think or say I am brilliant. I usually don't exercise my brilliance fully on fora such as this, because I am just making noises most people will never understand.

The things I have accomplished would make your head spin completely off of your neck in admiration. Read my book. Or, if that's too much, search Amazon for it, then go visit my website.

(I am unfortunately allowed to link there directly.)

In this current discussion, I provided people with directions to gain access to specific works, not authored by me, that I have already read. This was done in order that they be able to properly educate themselves, and at least begin to understand the problem.

I have *already* DONE the work. *That* is why I am a teacher. 

I am saying to those too lazy or unmotivated to bother that ""HERE. Right HERE is a good place to start!"" If Google is too much effort for you, then I doubt you will have the patience and fortitude to read the books to which I linked, (and then referenced in TWO separate posts.)

I worked in K-12 education and consulted for school districts for over 12 years. 

I have proven to parents and students that they can excel, despite the ridiculous expectations of a public school system. In many cases, students have gone from the bottom of the class to the very top student under my tutelage.

The common factor was they were *not* being taught. They were being shown inaccurate methods of achieving success. Once I stripped away the dross, and showed them ways to find the answers that they could actually grasp, they became confident. Often times, the teachers in their classes would become annoyed with them, since they had mischaracterized the student as lazy or unmotivated. In reality, they were simply bored.

The one thing I can assure you of is that public education has ZERO interest in the learning outcomes of children. Kids are warm bodies, and the eleventh-day count rules the day. That is where the funding is justified to the State.

All the other excuses as to why homework, band, sports, etc. are needed are bullshit.

Learning can be entirely self-directed, and successful, in spite of the presence of teachers and administrators. They are there to propagate a bureaucracy, at the expense of your children's ability to truly learn.

Don't take my word for it. Read John Taylor Gatto. Read The Teenage Liberation Handbook. Learn about 'unschooling.' Learn why the GED is the best thing for most high-school age kids who can actually think for themselves.

explainlikeimfive,ffvsq5t,t1_ffvru4k,1580272168.0,"So let me ask you something:

Education in this country is a multi-billion dollar business that contracts with various businesses and states to provide educational information that is probably outdated, outmoded or even biased.

Yet, we have now managed to create an interconnected network of tools that any child can utilize. 

Why not just use the money that props up the 'old' system to provide online access to information, and maybe create smaller schools, segregated by need and utility? In other words, if a kid is not being challenged in a school TODAY, then provide them with the tools for success. I define that as financial independence...

The public school system does NOT breed that into our children, as it is structured at present.  K-12 is a babysitting service, and provides scant opportunities for true critical thinking. Also, rivalry is encouraged, not from a sincere effort to have students excel, but from a misguided sense of tribalism. (See high school sports as an example.)

My idea would be to take the monies being used to improve neighborhoods, and provide a smartphone / home PC (chromebook?) for students to use, tailored to their specific learning styles, and self-paced.

Of course, this would also mean that a lot of the local administrative bodies would lose their mandates and taxpayer funding. Which is an ideal solution to me...

If sports are still important, than there are already plenty of arenas in which to provide venues.

If labs are needed, then local corporations could supply space to allow for paid interns or apprentice programs.

I think the socialization argument is a red herring, btw. Plenty of places to socialize, once people are able to support themselves.

Finally, there will be outliers, special needs etc. That is where privatization enters.

And, don't forget, private schools already have endowments and decades of material that is mostly available online already. The transition is eminently achievable if our government focuses resources in that direction."

Seriously, you are never going to 'not' be helping if you are a caring parent. So, a more realistic question would be how much a child will cost.

The daycare we had was handled by virtue of it being a benefit of employment. 

The first kid is always the most expensive, because you are learning what does and does not work, or need to be in your inventory. Baby showers get most of the big stuff out of the way (car seats, striders, etc.)

But, between medical care and sundries, it would be pretty easy to spend $400-1000 per month, if you aren't careful about it.

Check out Costco and Sam's Club for deals on things.

Coupons. Friends whose kids have grown. That kind of thing...

Once school starts, then the expenses increase. Be careful or you may turn into that parent who doesn't want you kid to feel left out. ie shoes, jackets, makeup (girls) or sports stuff (boys) etc.

At the time, I was glad I had almost $2k on hand. It went fast. Gas pumps were out from about ten miles north all the way 60 miles south.

We had to drive two vehicles 120 miles round trip, and luckily we had the cash, since the pumps were on generators, and the stations only took cash.

Another time, I was in Vegas and my debit card was declined. Why? Possible fraud alert, because I was in Vegas, not where I live. Bank put a three day hold on my account. Good thing I had another credit card, AND $600 cash.

You've got to develop the discipline to not let that money burn holes in your pocket, though.

Delayed gratification is key.

Once you have $100-150k in savings, and $50k cash, you can do what you want.

EDIT: It goes without saying you don't flash, or even tell anyone about this stash."

Over 50 years, that is 30 cents per day.

Is that really all that significant to you at this point? No.

Now, if you have $1,000,000 in cash, sitting around, then you have a good point.

Sure, you can put it in the bank. If there is an emergency where ATMs are down, or bank computers don't work - guess what? 

You should definitely have six months living expenses in a credit union. You can invest that in CDs.
