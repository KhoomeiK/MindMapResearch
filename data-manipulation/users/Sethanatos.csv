Edit: lol what are these downvotes for?

Edit 2: Sorry for shitting on your little ""Utopia"" but there are reasons people were willing to risk their lives, sailing to America on rafts. 
You don't see Cuban-Americans  fleeing back to Cuba."

NEET,feceg9h,t3_enzjo8,1578971969.0,"I myself am not a NEET, but a few years ago I realized I was in a situation that could've let be become one, and only through a flip of a coin did I fight back against the temptation. 

Im the kinda person with no internal motivation (maybe a bit for hobbies or tasty food). Though I like to think I'm a bit smart, I could only get things done if a clear goal/path is laid before me. 
Telling me to come up with it on my own makes me default to ""nah, I'll just leave and chill""

So to not leech off my parents, but not end up homeless, I joined the Navy. 
I'm tried right now, so I'll stop rambling for now, but in short: signing your life away into a situation that moves you to a new place outta your comfort zone, and you have to work or starve does wonders to realign your life.

PublicFreakout,fe5s0so,t1_fe3ago5,1578873693.0,"You have to realize that he's possibly never done that to someone before, so doesnt know when his opponent is out.  
I'm guessing in his adrenaline-fueled mind, there are x scenarios: ""He's unconscious and I let him go"" | ""He's still conscious and I let go."" | ""He's conscious and I hold a little longer."" | ""He's unconscious and I hold on a little longer""  
With this split-second thought process from someone with no experience, it's safer to keep holding on.  
I thin what the audience should be shouting instead of ""leggo! leggo of him!"" is ""You won. we'll hold him back. you're good"""

DMAcademy,fdzjdva,t3_enerdo,1578790786.0,"The aging drain on his body was him converting his life force into raw magic. 
He used so much that his past-self is still drawing his life-essence from his future selves, which is only kept at bay by his Patron.

Whenever he is hit with a crit, or when it'd be most dramatic, describe him momentarily reverting and withering. 
Heck, you could ocasionally describe any critical fumbles or terrible saving throws or skill checks as him stumbling from an badly-timed withering."
DMAcademy,fdzgy8r,t3_enbzoz,1578790125.0,"So one (near end-arc) adventure-weirdness could be that the party is in a place where people can't be coming an going and the players switch. 
Perhaps they or an NPC plays it off, ""Whoa, did you find a secret flaw in the barrier!?"", but  later a different NPC who was on guard could be ""How could they get past me.. only one entrance, multiple alarm spells, and my beast didn't detect any new scents.. it doesn't make any sense...""

Another could be perhaps an arc with minor artifacts that bond to only one person at a time. The hero-NPC quest giver has one or something) and he points the PCs to each get one to help him defeat his nemesis. ((the couple assumes the twins can use the same one since they're so close.))
At the final fight, Nemesis is revealed to be his (evil)twin, and turns the tide last-minute and disarms Hero-NPC. Nemesis makes a grab for his bro's artifact but when he tries to call upon its power he is vaporized/extremely damaged.
After the fight, Hero-NPC explains the artifacts can only bond to one person. 

Idk how to incorporate it in a fantasy world, but basically something something, handprint-locked safety deposit box, something something, both twins can open it."
