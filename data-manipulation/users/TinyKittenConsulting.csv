Catswhoyell,ff9whbo,t3_esau23,1579723019.0,The folks over at r/IllegallySmolCats would like a word about this crime.
traderjoes,ff9wctx,t1_ff9sg9u,1579722945.0,You are the non-vegan hero vegans (and vegetarians) need. The number of times I've heard someone refusing to eat something only because it does not have meat in it is just mind-boggling.
cats,ff9vq5g,t3_esacno,1579722549.0,It's like looking into the face of god.
rva,ff668zu,t3_erglwo,1579620132.0,What I take from this weekend is: responsible gun ownership is pretty much literally anything other than what people did this weekend.
Charlottesville,ff65kcn,t1_ff3wrc6,1579619662.0,"This surprises me. Not the people being oblivious, but the death glares in response to a politely worded ""pardon me"". Having lived here for over 30 years, I can't recall more than a handful of times that someone acted offended or huffy about me moving past them."
Charlottesville,ff658fl,t1_ff3et2i,1579619433.0,Really? Orlando is not worse? The I4 was a nightmare for me when I lived there. People would legit stop in the middle of the furthest left hand lane and let people out of the car into the median. No idea what they were doing there. Alligators in the road? Yup. People stopping to take pictures of alligators in the road? You bet. People deciding they did not want to go into a toll road and just turning around and driving into oncoming traffic. Tourists who felt the need to run into the middle of the road to have their picture taken with the WDW sign.
Charlottesville,ff64w5i,t1_feodtju,1579619196.0,Selling tickets probably would have made enough money to build a semi-decent storefront in its place.
Charlottesville,ff64rue,t1_ff630dh,1579619112.0,"I think saying it's a spatial awareness issue is being very kind. IMO, it's more of a ""no one matters but me"" issue."
Bonsai,ff06udz,t1_feq4fzx,1579465793.0,"Thank you for your response. The change was so immediate and dramatic and there was no change in the indoor temperature, so it made me think it was illness rather than a seasonal change."
Bonsai,fekuyum,t1_fekro95,1579208137.0,I believe so!
traderjoes,fekh55p,t3_eowfqu,1579199938.0,"Ugh, I hate them now. They're too creamy."
traderjoes,fekgs39,t3_epl76n,1579199726.0,Do you have an opinion on whose butt she sucks or...?
Charlottesville,fekgmig,t1_fekc7yv,1579199631.0,More pick ups = more costs. Less pick ups = less cost. Does the cost savings get passed down to the tenants? Nope.
Charlottesville,fek6b5e,t1_fek2fc5,1579193512.0,"Oh, sorry, I apparently lost the ability to read along with the ability to discard of my trash lol :) Thank you!"
Charlottesville,fek69y3,t1_fek380o,1579193492.0,Thank you!
Charlottesville,fek68cy,t1_fek3cr3,1579193466.0,Thank you so very much!
Charlottesville,fek67nr,t1_fek3mx4,1579193455.0,I like your style
Charlottesville,fejztpx,t1_fejxw40,1579189566.0,I don't think we have trash collection sites like that in Charlottesville since they have curbside pickup. Our trash collection sites (AFAIK) do not allow you to drop off regular household waste.

cats,fejwp05,t1_feihvsx,1579187580.0,"Never said she didn't like cats. Just that they couldn't have one. My sister loves dogs, but she tells her husband they can't have one. Not because she hates dogs (or her husband), but because they don't currently have the free time and outdoor space to give one the home it deserves."
cats,fejwl0g,t1_fejbeik,1579187507.0,"She turned into a cat, obvy."
cats,fejwimt,t1_feiqsq5,1579187465.0,"1) Show that you are responsible enough to care for it (changing litter, feeding, grooming, etc.).

2) Get a weekend job to help pay for it.

3) ???

4) CAT."
cats,fejwfnn,t3_epc4v5,1579187411.0,So... you didn't get to choose your own cat? Sounds like you need to up the ante and come home with two new cats of your own.
Bonsai,fejtk42,t3_en4xam,1579185512.0,"My Brazillian Rain Tree, purchased in December last year, was happy and thriving until it just tanked over the course of two or three days. Careful observation revealed a snail on the bark. Should I avoid the seller in the future or is this just sort of a ""win some, lose some"" situation?

Edited to add: The tree was indoors at my place the entire time."

rva,fehibon,t3_ep5o3z,1579117125.0,I was very confused as to why anyone was going to sleep on a bakery.
Whatcouldgowrong,fehhys9,t1_fehgxtt,1579116912.0,IDK where you live but you can't just go around shooting people in the face.

Whatcouldgowrong,feguobc,t1_feghhj3,1579102933.0,"This is a real problem for train conductors, particularly those who hit pedestrians or people committing suicide. It can really mess with their wellbeing."
nextfuckinglevel,fegu0li,t1_fegs3sp,1579102510.0,"Depending on the state you live in, maybe some things, but not much. I live in a ""right to work"" state, which just means my employer can fire me at any time with no cause given. There are technically federal protections for things like illness, but they're pretty easy to get around.

As far as losing coverage, there is a program you can use to extend your existing coverage after losing your job, but it's super expensive and pretty crappy. I had to use it when I aged out of my parents' insurance and did not have a job with insurance yet. I think it was something like 900 a month, which, when you're making ""just out of uni"" money is pretty expensive."

rva,fe9lbx6,t3_eo6m5t,1578939036.0,I love it when people decide the only reasonable solution to their dislike for a specific traffic pattern is to flagrantly disobey traffic laws and put everyone else in danger.
rva,fe9ks9n,t1_fe9e5qx,1578938738.0,Call their non-emergency number. Also consider calling animal control; they will for sure know who to contact.
cats,fe872sb,t1_fe6lzmp,1578923305.0,"I... do tip on AirBnB. But I'm old and used to travel with VRBO, where it was strongly implied that tipping was appropriate for the cleaning service."

cats,fe86vas,t1_fe5ugos,1578923226.0,"I think this is not uncommon for AirBnBer's who rent out rooms, not their whole houses. That being said, our AirBnB in Minnesota let their big cloud of a dog come visit with us while we stayed in their next door house."
Charlottesville,fe8693p,t1_fe619y6,1578923011.0,"Someone on here a while ago made the comment that they disabled that because it kept going off for UTS, but UTS could make it under the bridge, and it was considered a nuisance."
Charlottesville,fdhg2pi,t3_elcu1t,1578421891.0,Downtown mall area... city seems to have run out of snow plows. Haven't seen a single one this entire day.

Charlottesville,fde5269,t1_fde3klf,1578331348.0,"Unless it is user error or negligence in use, they'll be fine. It's a rent-a-crane, so whoever owns that crane is the one looking at some serious bucks."

Charlottesville,fddr09r,t3_ektykt,1578321688.0,"I hope the person they evacuated is okay. As awful as it sounds, I am grateful that the crane did not collapse on the neighboring apartment building. The construction company was pretty keen on storing it over the (occupied) building overnight and on weekends."
Charlottesville,fcyq1ph,t1_fcyoki2,1578084750.0,"Just double-checked using Google Earth. The Scrabble House is on the next corner down (McIntire and Nelson). This is the intersection of McIntire and Perry. But good thought; that was my initial thought, too!"

traderjoes,fckqqlp,t3_ehfcji,1577731148.0,"It must depend on what the grocery scene is like where you live. There are some more expensive items, but Trader Joe's is consistently the cheapest or close to the cheapest store for many items in my area."
Charlottesville,fckpf5v,t3_ehdn1e,1577730339.0,"Word of caution: Look for a fee-only advisor. Financial advisors/planners attached to banks may be great at their job, but unless they're fee-only, their job depends on looking out for the bank, not necessarily for you."

cats,fc6lnmg,t1_fc4vjyi,1577483501.0,"I recall someone on Reddit saying their vet used it because it was easier to talk to people about their pet's weight if they approached it with some levity. I guess people react better to ""here's a funny chart, now let's talk about the risks of the megachonk"" versus ""your cat fat, yo."""
Charlottesville,fc5fql3,t1_fc4q1rc,1577456293.0,"It's nice for the employees, but I can't imagine how expensive it must be to rent the storefront! I hope they get a nice lounge area in the sun at the front of the building :)"
