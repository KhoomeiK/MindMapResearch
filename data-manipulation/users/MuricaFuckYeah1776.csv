An acre is 43,560 square feet.

So 1 acre takes 7260 six packs. Each 6 pack is ~.56 gal. So it takes ~4084 six packs per acre.

There are roughly 6.3 billions gallons drank in the US each year. So it will take an entire years worth of beer to make a change roughly the size of Delaware. 

According to the USDA there was 389 million acres of cropland in 2012. So it would take 252 years of Michelob Gold being the only beer consumed in the US to convert all our cropland.

As far as synthetic vs conventional. My truck has the ford 5.4 in it, so considering it runs hotter than most gas engines would, I have to use synthetic cause conventional would break down and lose lubricity (I cant remembering they fixed that in the newer models). The bronco I use conventional. Diesel engines I prefer synthetic.

As far as brands I like the oil I get at the local coop (I think Cenex makes it), it's the best oil I've ever used. It's funny cause sometimes it works too good. If you overhaul an engine you're not supposed to use it cause it lubricates too well and wont seat the rings on the piston."

It was a fucking sting ray. I calmly walked out of the water, watching to make sure I didnt step on anything, and decided that it was not for me (although i did go parasailing later, but only cause we already paid for it). 

I tell ya though, I was glad to get back to Kansas, where the worst thing I gotta worry about in the water is a catfish thinking my toes are worms."

This plant grows tall and bushy, then after it matures its stalk becomes brittle, causing it to snap. It does this as a method of seed spreading. As it tumbles its branches ""plant"" the seeds as they come in contact with the soil.

This method makes for very interesting patterns, as the seeds will be planted in lines, and later sprout in said lines."
