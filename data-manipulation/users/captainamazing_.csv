Yesterday I decided to make a list myself and today I've found that it helps to provide her with some direction as used to lying in bed wondering where to start. Good luck and don't give up the fight.

Seek happiness and fulfillment first and a healthy relationship, among other things, are more likely to follow. To most women, nothing is more attractive than a man who loves life and himself. Simply seeking a woman is like seeking success. Simply finding success out of the blue is far less likely. But seeking the things that LEAD to success will put you on the path toward it. I hope this helps. Good luck brother."
