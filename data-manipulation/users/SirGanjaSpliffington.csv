AskReddit,ffpvc3z,t3_eua69p,1580107108.0,"Not a teenager anymore, im my mid twenties but I do clearly remember one of the hardest things about being a teenager is the negative connotation of being considered a millennial. Seems like being a millennial has been coined into a negative thing. Whenever I bring it up people especially boomers they say I'm being sensitive about it. It's not that I'm offended, it's just it becomes incredibly annoying to hear consistently. I could take a joke but it comes to a point where it's no longer funny and it becomes malicious. There are Fb groups and tweets that would specifically target millennials just to put them down and these are the same people that are our teachers, parents, grandparents, aunt's, uncle's, and any other older adult authority figure. It's even more annoying that a lot of boomers are genuinely incredibly gullible and believe millennials do a bunch of crazy stuff. It's amazing how people will perceive satire for reality. It makes me cringe whenever I hear ""stepford wife"" have the audacity to preach about fiscal responsibility when they never worked hard a single day of their lives. Shut up Karen, you're mantra is live laugh love. You're not original."

PUBG,ffpdf7x,t3_eu94yq,1580092268.0,"My friends and I like to call it the pea shooter. VSS gets a lot of hate but I think it's a very underrated weapon in the game. I've won a couple chicken dinners with a VSS. I feel like the range and how quiet it is compensates for its lack of stopping power. I've gotten some very sexy kills using the VSS. It's just not that expected. Whenever I get gunned down by a VSS it's the only gun that makes it kinda difficult to find your opponent once it's been fired. It's not loud, doesn't have much of a flash, decent range, and since it isn't super powerful the recoil is not as bad so the handle in my opinion compensates and if you know how to use the VSS well. Whenever I have someone in my scopes using the VSS if I don't kill them the first time they are frantically looking for me and It seems like everyone that I go after with the VSS has trouble looking for me if it's long range. Not saying I never get detected but I have died a lot of times using the VSS simply because it's not good for close quarters."

WTF,ffp65xs,t1_ffos4p6,1580087225.0,"Imo bed bugs. Unfortunately I had to deal with them not too long ago because I live in the middle of a major city in a low-income housing so you got all sorts of trashy characters living here and some of them are drug addicts and/ or homeless that have no sense of cleanliness. Apparently I attracted them from the outside and I could tell you that bed bugs are incredibly difficult bugs to kill. At least with the cockroach when you step on it with boots or something it squishes and dies. With a bed bug you could pin them down and squish them with the eraser of a pencil and put all your weight onto it and they still won't die. They're smaller than roaches so harder to detect and they bite. Roaches don't bite.... At least the ones where I'm from. With roaches you don't have to worry about waking up in the middle of night to sharp painful itching bites that itch so much that you want to take a cheese grater to the bites and rub your skin raw. They're also quite tactful where they bite you from personal experience. When they bite me they like to get the most inconvenient places like the back of my knee, butt cheecks, my wenis (elbow skin), The tips of my ears and the lobes, got one on the tip of my nose before, My little toe on my left foot, shoulder blades, Even got one bite on one of my areolas. Their persistent bastards that you could bomb time and time again but You can get rid of a 99% of them but it only takes that one extra percent for them to multiply. thankfully I've been good at preventing it before I became a full-blown infestation but it was still one of the worst pasts I've got to deal with in my life that I wish never to deal with again. Talk about a pain in the ass holy shit!"

AmItheAsshole,ffiux8r,t1_ffiu1n0,1579983336.0,I'm saving up and finding a better job so at the meantime and I have financial issues so the particular SRO is the only one I can get into for the time being. Yes there are other SROs in the Bay area but they're in very high demand so the fact that I got this one means I got lucky. Obviously I'm not satisfied with my situation and I attend on getting out but one step at a time so I'm just predicting a year for two. I'm not mean to these people. I've been homeless myself so I understand where they're coming from and I do acknowledge them and on the case then give them a dollar. A lot of them are addicted to crystal meth and prostituting themselves in front of my building... They come in to use the bathrooms. Some of them are courteous but some of them destroy the bathrooms and I think a mixture of being on meth and mental illness contributes to that. I hope I'm not coming across as an insensitive jerk because that's not my intention. I'm hesitant calling the police because they have no place to go and It does pull in my heartstrings but at the same time I shouldn't be riddled in bed bugs and be on the lookout for dirty needles every time I want to take a shower... I suppose logistically speaking the police wouldn't be able to do much. I get that I'm staying in a low-income area so it's not going to be the hills or anything but there should be some level of standard. Why should I and other  tenants (including babies and children) have to get sick?

The first thing I do early in the morning should not be take a testafter given so much homework the day before staying up incredibly late to catch up on assignments. It doesn't help that sometimes I would get home works and projects from different teachers and sometimes I would have to whole project due on the same day and it would be very overwhelming. My fellow classmates and I have complained before to the school staff but since we were kids we weren't seen as equal so the adults would just dismiss everything we said.  I got out of school in 2012 so wasn't very recent but relatively recent.
