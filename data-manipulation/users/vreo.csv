CollapseSupport,fgglea6,t1_fgfzq5h,1580764295.0,"I am glad that you appreciated my post. The name of the cult ends on 'witnesses'... They themselves obviously don't see it as a cult but as the only true faith (with everybody else getting killed during their apocalypse). I can tell you, they are glowing with happiness right now with all these bad news, because they think the end is near (our end, not theirs).  
   
My kids are rather small (oldest being 13), so careers are not hot topics right now. But the 13yr old is aware of everything and has a hands-on mentality. She is keen on getting hands dirty and do gardening, learning about herbs and fungi and helps with storing stuff in the basement etc (I bought some food etc because I can't rule out some economic problems if the rest of the world is hit by nCoV like China is; I thought I better have stuff that I don't need than regretting not having it in times of need). She is aware that knowing crafts and getting skills will help everyone.  
And I try to subtly seed the idea, that they don't need to have kids to feel complete. You know, small girls tell about nothing else at times, how they want a family etc. I don't hammer that idea down, I just tell her, that there's also an option to have all that time for herself and her partner. I don't want them to later think they miss something, I don't know if this will work out, I hope though.  


My wife was always good at saving and putting money into saving plans. My plan is a bit different and a lot more delusional. I put all my time and money into far fetched business ideas. Thanksfully they never include large investments.  
So right now I teamed up with a very good salesman and business works out. I think that was the stupid plan for all of my life, hitting gold or die trying. So I personally am the last person on earth you want to ask for financial advice, I am just not good at saving money, I depend on others to know better than me.  
For me money has the most value right now. I'd like to try to use the money to build myself a leverage, and open a market.  
I know there's FIRE (financial independant, retire early) and they do the math on saving as much as you can, it works out with time, but honestly, I doubt there's much time left. We only need a few years of global drought and stuff will get nasty. We are on track for massive changes. Heck, if nCoV goes around the globe, we will get a gigantic economic crisis this year. Maybe it is already unavoidable with China shutting down, maybe that alone will send shockwaves into the worlds economy. Nobody can see into the future.   
I am sorry I can't be of much help. I feel I just put out a wall of text with nutty prepper opinions. I am no pessimistic guy. The opposite is true, I enjoy life and appreciate the little things. But I also am aware of bad things and I won't try to ignore them. So I love everyday with my kids and try to make everyday count. Nobody knows how much 'normal days' are left.   
I don't think my kids will have a life that is comparable to mine. I try to give them the ability to adapt to whatever comes their way. I am pretty sure, there won't be pensions when they are old enough."
CollapseSupport,fgfydke,t1_fgfph9u,1580750296.0,"I saw all of this pretty late. I was in a religious cult most of my life, which would bet on things getting worse because this would show 'god' was about to cleanse the earth. So when things got ugly, instead of getting a motivation to fight, you get a 'grab popcorn' mentality.   
I went out of it 6 years ago (atheist now), so this gives me the cards I have been dealt with. 3 Kids, family and small house, almost no friends or network (that cult makes sure you lose your life on exit). And realizing the state of the planet.  


So I am not in a position of power like some celebrity or wealthy CEO who could use money or influence. My options would be reducing our families footprint and maybe voting and going to a protest. Here in middle Europe, there's no party which would acknowledge the scope of the crisis, so who should I vote, they are all only concerned about the economy. Protest, yeah, we did that. Others did it since 40 years. Same results.   
What's left? Reducing your own footprint. I know this might hurt many people, but I find this is the weakest and most treacherous option. It is basically 'grabbing popcorn' again. You did your part, now it's the turn of the others.  


If I were a financial heavy weight I would take things in my hands. It is e.g. 16 ships that pollute as much as all cars on the planet together. It is 70-100 companies that are responsible for the largest share of CO2. I would pay each and everyone to sabotage their own company or ships until it all stands still.  


This whole mess is not a technological problem. It is a psychological problem. And this is why I don't have much hope for a Disney ending. Democracies are not able to deal with this kind of threat. Pluralistic societies which respect the noble as the stupid voices are running into a wall at the moment. We give attention to people believing in flat earth and climate change deniers and lose ourselves in the process. I can't see any good solution. Nobody wants to be stripped of human rights and live in a authoritarian regime. But with listening to each and every idiot we just waste time in a democracy.  


As long as I don't have the power to stop those 116 assholes myself I can only adapt to whatever life throws at me. I am a computer nerd. My brain is my asset. I am not big or strong or a skilled craftsman. But if things move into a grim future, I need to build a new me. I started with planting veggies, working with wood and I want to get a bit into electronics to be capable of work with stuff that I might find.
