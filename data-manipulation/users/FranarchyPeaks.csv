TIHI,ffquo1i,t1_ffqq7ly,1580144041.0,Eating a balanced diet is not wrong. Killing animals is not wrong. You're being human centric and trying to control nature when you try to push unnatural behaviors.
TIHI,ffquek6,t1_ffq628r,1580143869.0,Or dumb enough to ignore the fact that you're human and not some kind of advanced godlike species. Take your place in nature as a predator because that is how we evolve.
TIHI,ffqu2g4,t1_ffqhf5d,1580143652.0,Right. Nature has created way more complicated machines and they come in a variety of species. We are as nature intended just like the beardroid and the bunnybot.
TIHI,ffqtx66,t1_ffqkd7h,1580143556.0,What a cop out. So to a greater being we are nothing but ants so our behavior is excuses.
TIHI,ffqtrmz,t1_ffq2yiz,1580143456.0,Animals have a choice not to rape and kill their own and you can't excuse it with the old is their nature argument. Human nature is to kill and conquer and use weaker species just like nature intended and yall whining.
