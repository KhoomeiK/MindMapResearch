AskAnAmerican,ffjag4x,t3_etrc0j,1579994200.0,"Well I live in Orlando now and honestly it feels pretty similar to Jacksonville. People think Jacksonville is boring compared to Orlando but the only major difference is in the big stuff like Universal, Disney, other tourist attractions. People think there's murder around every corner in Jacksonville but that's only in the bad parts of town, the rest of the city is a great place to raise a family. Overall the 2 cities are quite similar, people from all over, very suburban, need a car to get around, lots of chain restaurants."

AskAnAmerican,ffgfs2d,t1_ffet7wv,1579905244.0,That's extremely narrow-minded and judgmental to assume that's what Republicans think. Most people I know are Republicans I've never heard of someone blaming poor people for being poor.
AskAnAmerican,ffgfo8z,t1_ffeto17,1579905179.0,You labeled everything that wasn't SouthEast or Gulf Coast as one region. You also simplified the 2 regions you named. only 40% of people in SE Florida are Hispanic. I know very few people from Canada and people from New England live all over the state. You ignored all major metro areas but Miami.

AskAnAmerican,ffep6qo,t1_ffc3665,1579858456.0,Sadly I've seen these arguments in other subs. It's crazy how race is supposed to change the way we vote.
AskAnAmerican,ffep1l3,t1_ffb9cn1,1579858244.0,"It used to just be religious, but each country was 99% one religion and things got kind of mixed up. Also it just makes sense for governments to be involved in marriage. Personally I think there's a difference between religious marriage and whatever the government decides is marriage. It's way too complicated and doesn't really matter all that much."

My family stayed in the same region of New York for 200 years, now each member of their family lives in different parts of the country. It's hard to feel that close to your community when your moving every generation."
