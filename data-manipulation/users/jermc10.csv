awfuleverything,ffay8wp,t3_esea9r,1579747267.0,Pretty sure just looking at this picture could give someone herpes.
nottheonion,ffah6br,t3_esb02r,1579735644.0,Good luck with those injections dude. Feel bad for the coyote though.
dogs,feivcp9,t3_ep5jpm,1579148218.0,"I'm terribly sorry to hear about your pup, I had the same misgivings when it was time to make the same decision that you're now faced with, and even pleaded with the vet when it came time to tell me I was wrong and making a mistake, but I wasn't, and I think by what you say that you are also not wrong.  No one can really tell you if it's time or not, you have to go by you're own judgement.  I feel for you, and for your pup."
Calgary,feiugak,t3_ecleg0,1579147522.0,"My RV was parked on my street until this week, until this week when parking enforcement received a complaint and said it had to be moved within 36 hours, this the coldest week this winter so far in Calgary, so I set up a generator for the block heater and put a charger on the battery, but in the end ended up boosting it anyway.  Well it finally started, not like you could miss it, my usually quiet RV now has straight pipes because someone hacked off the catalytic converter.  Well the jokes on them, two summers ago while in K country I went over a cattle gate and the catalytic converter collapsed internally, and my fix at the time was to just gut it completely and then re-attach the empty shell, so the sniveling prolapsed rectum that crawled under there and hacked it off actually got an empty cat, fuck you nameless swine."

worldnews,fdo7gyx,t1_fdo76r2,1578600218.0,How likely is it that the sa-15 could be hacked remotely?
dogs,fdo5lz4,t3_emeroq,1578599304.0,"It’s likely your pup will start to slow down just a little bit over the next year or two and may not need quite as much activity to be happy. That being said, if your financial situation allows, you could get either a dog walker or start taking him to doggy daycare."
worldnews,fdka5ux,t1_fdk9mo7,1578499534.0,"My condolences to you, and to everyone that is affected by this tragedy."

AskReddit,fc5rnj3,t3_egd8yv,1577464383.0,Probably so they’re more likely to feed the little parasites that result from the sex.
vandwellers,fbuotw8,t1_fbtkkej,1577117984.0,That was my thought as well.
