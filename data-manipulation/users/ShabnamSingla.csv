Then I just realise how relaxed and satisfied I am being alone."

AskReddit,fg2zdjs,t3_ewcpzl,1580462902.0,"When the other person would try to ask you 'was it that bad?' 'do you really feel that way?' or would dig up something even worse from the past, everytime I just described something really shitty experience I just had. 

I mean, it's just hard to deal with somebody to whom you've to prove that what you feel is actually valid and you're rightly describing it. I do understand that the other person might just wanted to help out etc. But it just drains all the energy left and it's just not something you'd want to experience every week."
askphilosophy,fg2qxtx,t1_fg2lzsl,1580452377.0,"Not really, actually. The department is in a bad shape at the moment and there aren't enough professors. One of my previous professors left (is really busy at his new place) and another one passed away last semester. The other two are themselves teaching currently and I'm not really on good terms with them because of the way they teach. (And that they took things personally once I tried to raise the points.) There's one left and she has been again ignoring my mails and messages. I'm really not sure what way to go. Wish I was exaggerating."
askphilosophy,fg2dq9v,t1_fg0uwe1,1580443069.0,"Right. Other than Reddit, do you think there's any other place to talk to such people online?

Because offline, in my immediate surroundings, there aren't many such people available. I've tried contacting a few and most of them don't really seem to have many answers either or are unrelated."
askphilosophy,fg2d794,t1_fg1132m,1580442794.0,"Yeah, now I feel like may be I'm expecting too much from the classes and trying to, sort of, find an excuse to not put in actual efforts. But at the same time, I learn visually, so it's really helpful to have certain visuals from lectures stay with me to remember the though process that went into a certain topic. I'm not sure how to maintain that.

Also, how do you manage to stay on track when you're mostly on your own? I find it hard because of lack of certain kind of self discipline. And then self doubt also kicks in, that I'm not really capable anyway and if I'm even interested in doing this etc. It just gets tough to keep all of this balanced and actually maintain my reading/analysing habit."
AskAcademia,fg2b1p8,t1_fg1d176,1580441685.0,"What I meant by online lectures isn't online content/videos in general but not very popular footages from hour long class lectures of certain universities as it is. There aren't highlights or any pleasing characteristic to it, I feel. And are rich in their content, much more than what I get in my class. And because I learn visually, it's just easier to keep track of my thought process if there are certain visuals on the board on the screen while I'm engaging with a topic. 


Yeah, actually I've been questioning if I just like the idea of reading texts, writing papers etc. because it's something I admire in my head. About the dialogue, interaction part, that's exactly what isn't happening in most of my classes (there are just 8 people in my class) and that just makes you go passive with your approach and because the peers aren't also interested in Philosophy, I'm not sure how to retain my interest, if it was there to begin with. 

Need to sit down and actually teach myself, yeah. The only problem I face with this, is that, of self discipline and self doubt. Because there's no angle of accountability as such, it's just easier to lose track and eventually lose interest. Then I end up feeling like I'm not really capable enough. May be I just need to start somewhere, I feel."
AskAcademia,fg29gnh,t1_fg0xkfc,1580440888.0,"Right, that makes sense. The only problem with this, that I face, is of self discipline and self doubt. Because there's no accountability in the process of doing things on my own, it's just easier to lose track, even after talking to a professor. And rather than actually engaging more to solve this, I try to start maintaining the distance thinking that I'm not capable enough anyway etc. Now that I've written this, I realise how stupid it might sound but yeah that's what I was doing so far."
askphilosophy,fg0esfc,t3_euscdj,1580406288.0,"I'm a Philosophy sophomore and currently in my 4th semester (of total 6 semesters). I had strong plans regarding continuing in academia after I graduate up until my previous semester. But this semester, I don't really have any good professors, I don't feel like sitting in their lectures. These aren't even lectures. They ask us to read the text out loud in class and if there's any doubt, they end up either not answering it because they give the excuse of not having any 'specialisation' in that field or what they tell isn't helpful in any sense. But then, I need to sit in the classes because there's a strict attendance policy. 

I realise I'm complaining but it just gets hard to see myself losing interest in the things I thought I liked. I really like listening to lectures online/irl. I do try to watch online lectures but otherwise after classes end, I'm busy with extra curriculars that I don't get the time/energy to do things from scratch and it's been bothering me a lot. Plus it's just easy to not do it at all when there's almost no drive left. I'm not sure how to read/sort everything on my own. I really want to though. 

Earlier I could get food for thought in class lectures and I used to feel excited to go back and work on it further to find answers. Now because I know it's gonna be a dull day the next day, I don't feel like going prepared etc. Plus it's just really hard for me to keep myself motivated throughout the length of the semester. Given that I need to start thinking about further plans, I'm just super confused about even continuing in Philosophy. Plus there's really nobody to talk to about this. About the classmates, they have never taken Philosophy seriously and had no plans to continue it further anyway, so I don't think they find this relatable. 

Then when I read about people advising against going for masters in humanities because of lack of opportunities, financial instability later etc., it just demotivates me further. Now I just get irritated with the idea of discussing Philosophy. I'm having second thoughts about almost everything at this point. 
Any kind of advice/suggestions/remarks would be appreciated.

(Also, it's not a general loss of interest in things because I've my elective as theatre which I absolutely love and I'm going for regular football practice sessions which is again, something I'm really enjoying.)"
college,ffz5oav,t1_ffz37ra,1580364823.0,"Do you've any advice on getting through those unbearable lectures?

Overall, it does seem nice to read about someone else's similar experience and gives me some hope. Need to push myself a bit more, I'm guessing. And may be ignore the part of me which still expects the same profs to 'get better' and just focus on working on my own. How? That I hope I'll figure out with time."
college,ffz5fr1,t1_ffz4u0a,1580364623.0,"To be challenged, yes but at the same time, learn a bit more about ideas but not in numbers, statistics or scientific ways. I had eco/math combination for one year and it just felt too distant so I shifted to Philosophy. I really enjoyed Philosophy and the amount of space it gave for creativity (written/visual) but this semester it's getting a bit tough to look at the 'bright side'. I was just hoping for a decent enough job in teaching Philosophy to get by at the end of studies and continue getting ideas to keep working on my art, on the side. Now things are getting a little blurry, that's all. I don't see it as a mistake, upto now at least."
college,ffz4dx9,t1_ffz2tpg,1580363582.0,"That option isn't available here. And I had actually switched from eco/maths combination to Philosophy last year, because I really wanted to study Philosophy."

Wow. I thought I really knew about Spinoza and really liked 'his philosophy'. But all I knew was about geometrical method and substance related arguments etc. Nothing on the context provided by you."

askphilosophy,fekf5bi,t1_fejjpcu,1579198749.0,"Given that my classes don't have more than 7-8 people at a time, the teachers usually don't prepare slides or don't have proper lecture material prepared. They try to keep it discussion based (mostly) but nothing substantial comes out of it, as such. It's very general.

Usually, since the faculty is new at my school, they're still experimenting with the ways to teach (I'm guessing) and aren't that well-versed with the topics yet, they usually read out from the prescribed text and try to explain it to us, which I think, some of it makes sense, yes, but at the same time, there's this doubt that remains about if they're teaching the 'right' thing at all. 

So I do try to note down their explanation (or maior points in bits) with proper details only to find out later that the understanding I had developed all along wasn't really the right one. And reading on my own later sort of messes it up even more. 

I'm not sure if this is going off topic but any kind of advise/way out here would be highly appreciated! Would you recommend focusing on the readings just on my own, independently? Since my class also doesn't really have any people who actually show interest in the subject."
