dogs,ffgf2bc,t1_ffge10m,1579904796.0,"So, ""locking the jaw"" as far as I can tell isn't a real thing. A dog will hold on tightly sure but there's nothing in the jaw that will lock into place. 

The thumb-butt thing... I've heard it. I haven't heard anyone say anything positive about it though. Mostly that it's an easy way for the dog to whip around and bite your forearm. So, can't imagine it's safe, practical, or the best option."
dogs,ffg39p1,t1_ffg1xcu,1579897518.0,"I too would kill for my dog if that's what it took. Other dog or other human. That isn't quite what I was talking about though. Not all dog fights are to the death, most that I've seen are just 10 second brawls. This was when I went to the dog park regularly.

The way I view human-dog interacting is if you can achieve the same results without harming the dog then there's no excuse to use heavy handed techniques, like shock collars. I follow the LIMA strategy in that sense.

It's just a bit of a complete reversal when the teeth come out. I have no notion that I could persuade a dog with treats to stop killing another dog, that's not realistic - but I wish a force free method was available. That being said, I understand harm reduction. It's much better to choke a dog out and have them in a bit of pain temporarily so another dog may live, no question about it. It's just a bit disheartening. An unfortunate part of the job."
dogs,ffg015g,t1_fffu7td,1579895524.0,I'm not a personal fan of choking a dog out just because my gut reaction is that it's unnecessary and too heavy handed but I understand that short term uncomfortable is better than death by dog. It's so conflicting for me personally because I try to train using 99% R+ but when a fight occurs then more P+ seem to be in order which is the opposite of how I usually operate.
dogs,fffugpp,t1_ffftkup,1579892050.0,"I had just watched that video, including a few others before making my post. It was informative! 

My biggest takeaway from this has been the only agreed on tactic is quick and calm separation of dogs in a fight. Obviously the preferred method is to never have a fight in the first place.

It just sucks because the longer I'm active and working with dogs, the closer and closer the chances of me dealing with a dog fight reach to 100% just based on odds and human failure, I'm not perfect after all. Feeling like I'm not properly prepared with a certified go-to plan feels very unsatisfactory."

dogs,fffo3vo,t1_fffnc45,1579888127.0,"I won't lie, that's a but unsatisfactory. Though I understand that you have to mold training to the specific dog so I guess it'd make sense that breaking up fights works the same way.

Do you know if there's a general rule for how long to separate dogs before reintroducing them? I can't imagine it's practical for dogs that live together to be forever separated."

BetterEveryLoop,ff2bhao,t3_eqz9o3,1579499658.0,"Just a friendly reminder to everyone that using a shock collar falls under Positive Punishment behavior modification. Most reputable dog behavior/training organizations follow the LIMA protocol and using Positive Punishment is the absolute last thing they try and only those aware of the risks, signs of those risks, and knowledge on how to reverse them if they happen, are to preform this. 99% of dog behavior cases do not require this though."

unpopularopinion,ff28hry,t1_ff24ykt,1579496890.0,"Yeah I work with dogs pretty regularly actually. 

Dogs attack for several reasons but the most common is fear. Dogs lack the level of mental awareness to do things that we'd say are ""evil"". While they might commit the act itself, such as attacking a child, they lack the malicious intent. The dog might be hungry, feel threatened, the child inst picking up on the ""go away I'm uncomfortable"" body language and it resorts to using more extreme language so it can be understood. Dogs are pretty predictable when you get to know them.

Though it's true, humans require consistent shitty circumstances, so do dogs. The difference is just the level of mental maturity. Dogs have on average the awareness of a 3-4yo human. But even in normal communities of people, they're pretty awful. I just personally have the opinion that if you don't think humans, on average, aren't awful, you ought to meet more humans."
unpopularopinion,ff24be5,t3_er1syq,1579493432.0,"Couple weeks ago I saw a video of a baby that was stuffed in a trash bag and thrown into a dumpster, presumably by it's mother. Luckily it was found but I know things like this happen every single day. I can't help but think humans aren't very great on average.

Dogs on the other hand? Pretty simple. They have basic needs that need to be met and they're happy. No alternative motives. No mass destruction of the environment. I've yet to see a dog go on a racist rant and threaten to kill someone for being a different color or worshiping a different god.

So yeah. Dogs > Humans"

In my example of the dog at the door, my solution uses two quadrants - negative reinforcement of taking away the reward (my attention) and then positive reinforcement (giving the dog attention when the proper action is displayed.

So many great training tools use at least more than one quadrant at once. For instance, leading (using a good lure to position the dog) uses several quadrants in just a simple trick."

Yeah, from what I've read, heavy handed positive punishments WILL get results but they can have some serious drawbacks. It's just better to use other methods that are more humane.

Example: You want to stop your dog from jumping up on you when you enter the house. You use positive punishment and hit the dog every time he jumps up to greet you. The dog will get the message not to jump up but it's also possible he could associate the punishment with greeting people or even you coming home, which could turn him fearful or even aggressive to that trigger. Not to mention it damages the bond between owner and pet.

In that example, you'd probably be better off using Negative Reinforcement by ignoring the dog until they settle down them shower them with love and attention. This'll teach the dog that they won't get your attention (the reward) until the desired behavior is exhibited.

Hitting dogs falls under one of the four quadrants of behavior modification, specifically Positive Punishment. While not all Positive Punishment is bad - hitting serves zero purpose to modify behavior effectively. Improper use of Positive Punishment can have negative effects on the dogs temperament and relationships - even possibly causing them to become more aggressive or fearful. Instead, an owner ought to simply teach their dog ""no"" or ""leave it""."
