therewasanattempt,ffat6jm,t1_ffafxko,1579743911.0,"I will say that I believe you’re missing an important dimension, though overall I don’t disagree with what you’re saying. 

I think a huge part of what makes cultural appropriation feel different than exchange or sharing is differential treatment. 

Example: 
white hippy with dreads. Reaction: wow bet he smokes weed haha. 
Black guy with dreads. Reaction: that man makes me feel unsafe!

Like when your culture is known for something, and you aren’t allowed to express it, or get blowback for doing so, while another cultural group gets a free pass.... it feels bad and builds resentment. Of course the sane reaction is “hey fuck you! You literally just took our thing from us and co-opted it after shitting on us for it!”

But also, sure, anxiety too."

totalwarhammer,feecv72,t1_fee8ayn,1579031140.0,"Yeah, it's weirdly common. I guess it has to do with their personality, but it's so extreme! I've seen powerful factions just ignore easy to claim settlements who they're at war with for... no reason? It is also strange that the number of settlements seems not to correlate too strongly to the AI power level. I don't know why that is--do they receive a flat economic bonus, then generate money from settlements as normal? That would indicate they aren't using those extra settlements effectively to expand their economy. That's my best guess tbh. 

But I've seen it plenty of times. The greenskins are a powerhouse and expand until they have 30 something settlements.... Then they just start to lose battles. Still a ton of settlements, you'd think they could re-spawn stacks fast and get in the fight against smaller empires, right? But no, they're a fringe player now. With 30 settlements."
totalwarhammer,feecae8,t1_fee99en,1579030802.0,"I think with electric cars, a large part of what held that back was existing auto companies and the oil industry. It represented a clear threat to them, and they did their best to keep those things sidelined. I'm not sure there's a similar force in the gaming industry--I think it's more about the feasibility and riskiness.

Feasibility-wise, I don't have enough information for a real opinion. I'm not sure you do either, though I could be wrong. 

Like firstly, how do you build the AI we're discussing programmatically? Is it currently possible? It it going to be insanely costly? Why or why not? After all, many experiments with AI development have been from companies with far more resources than CA, or research institutions. Or companies that are specifically created and invested in to develop AI. What kind of overlap in terms of skills do those entities have with a game company? Logistically, CA is not going to invest millions in a R&D arm that may never translate into profit from games. They would ruin themselves trying to be someone they aren't.

That's just question 1. The second major obstacle is computational, in my opinion. Many advanced AI networks take serious dedicated processing space. Is the average gaming PC capable of implementing AIs like this in a game? I have no idea, and I kind of doubt it. But if it's just the top 25% of gaming computers that can handle it--the game is going to fail. No one is going to be able to run these awesome strategy AIs, and CA has just invested a huge extra chunk of money in a game that tanked.

Finally, assuming the above don't make this implausible, will it make CA money? Will more people buy the game because of the AI? Or are the majority of gamers happy enough with the strategic AI in the market that it won't swing things  very much. Because with all that additional investment in new technologies, you have to make up that ground you lost by beating the shit out of everyone else in the market--or you just failed your primary mission as CA. This isn't like inventing something new where you have no existing competition. You have a new feature in a hugely saturated gaming market, and that feature needs to pull enough people in that it justifies the cost of creating it."
totalwarhammer,fee9wbu,t3_eoctvy,1579029404.0,"[This youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXPTVNbZmxk), and the channel in general, is really great. The video is basically about how to control your army efficiently. Perhaps you don't want to put any effort into it, and that's also okay! It's a game and you can play how you like. 

I'd also suggest making liberal use of pause when you're starting out if you don't plan on playing multiplayer battles right away."
totalwarhammer,fee74u0,t1_feb2bf1,1579027779.0,"Yeah most lizardmen melee units have high armor, even if they're not marked as ""armored"" on the unit card. Look at the stats and you'll see they have great armor, good melee attack and outstanding weapon damage. They are essentially elite infantry. In online battles their cost is a lot more limiting, but in campaign there's no ""10k gold per side"" limit.

So take armor piercing infantry for your units you want in combat where you can, take some anti armor ranged units, and then mix with anti large for the dinos. Speaking of the dinos, they also have heavy armor and you'll want to keep some ranged damage on them as much as possible. Even while they're in melee, they're easier to hit than infantry. Keep shooting and feed them disposable anti large units if you know you can't spare enough to kill them at the moment.

Uphill battle against any 1:1 lizard army, because it's probably far more expensive than yours. Lizardmen have pretty high quality units across the board!"
totalwarhammer,fee6gdn,t1_feaiejm,1579027379.0,"Yeah, I've had some pretty annoying Tomb Kings fights where they just keep spawning stacks in their last settlement that race deep into my territory, drawing armies away. Which honestly is a great tactic... If they weren't ignoring the 2 stacks that were bearing down on their last province, which was defended by basically 20 skeleton units + garrison. 

Like great, my armies are chasing your forces that can't really escape anywhere, and now you have no more cities. Good job! 

That said, it worked much better earlier in the campaign when they did the same thing. Actually delayed me quite a bit and forced me to expand my military. I think adding a little more situational awareness would a more-or-less  attainable, impactful improvement for the AI"
totalwarhammer,fee5rr5,t3_eo8cvq,1579026973.0,"It does have considerable flaws, that much is pretty much true of every strategy game AI over a certain complexity. If it were to be dramatically improved, it would fundamentally change the game of, well, strategy games.

Right now the best most developers can do to make the game not a total cakewalk is, as you say, pretty hamfisted. They need to give the AI massive economic advantages because it doesn't know how to balance its needs effectively (in terms of economy/military/tech, mostly in building choice and allocation). They need to make the AI target you more because you're better than it. They need to give the AI unit buffs on the tactical map because it doesn't know how to deploy, move and fight as effectively.

It's really hard to get around those challenges without making computationally feasible AI with actual reactive intelligence. Which would be a  huge revolution in AI opponents, and probably significant for human development overall. I don't really know all the technical challenges here, but based on our experiments with AI outside of the game world, I'm assuming it's not an easy task to actually build an opponent that has a real understanding of the game like a human does.

I do think there could be more attainable improvements in the way the AI values territory and how it goes on the attack. I just played a ME campaign where Hexoatl marched up Lustria towards DE lands, and when the Skaven started rolling up his  territory down South... He did not react, as far as I could tell. Now maybe he did, there was FoW that kept me from seeing what exactly went down. But there was very little ""flipping back and forth"" of territory. Just him continuing to gain in the North, while ruins continued appearing down South. So fixing things like AI allocating its forces across its territory, or for attack and defense, I think that is a lot more plausible."

AskReddit,fc6ywyk,t1_fc6xe3z,1577493090.0,"Yeah, it’s tricky because at some point, everyone except our immediate family was “random” at one point. When do they stop being random? Is it pure chance who we’re “allowed” to interact with? Or do we get to choose. 

I think it’s interesting to consider things like this about how humans interact!"
AskReddit,fc6xynw,t1_fc67388,1577492372.0,"I mean it really does depend. Bars are usually pretty acceptable, especially if you’re like in line for drinks next to them or something. But if they’re a total stranger  with  their back to you, and you just tap them on the shoulder and say “hi I want to go out with you,” that’s probably gonna be weird. 

If you’ve seen them at the bar often and they glance back, or you turn around, meet their eyes and say “oh, hi I see you around here pretty often right?” If they respond “I guess.” Then you should back off. If they respond “yeah! I work right down the road so I stop in a few times per week,” then you’re clear to keep talking!

So... there aren’t especially firm rules about *where* it’s appropriate so much as different places have different thresholds for “when is it acceptable for a relative stranger to come talk to me.” Gym had a pretty high threshold, bar is generally pretty low.... as long as you’re being chill and respecting their boundaries."
AskReddit,fc6xbxg,t1_fc67a6d,1577491908.0,"I have no idea why you’re getting downvoted. Look, usually women don’t ask guys out. Maybe some do, but the trend is not in that direction.

So, as a guy, you must talk to women to get dates. There is literally no way around it. So your options are the internet, or real life. In real life, your options are people you know, and strangers. If you don’t want to date anyone you know, or moved to a new city, you’re limited to strangers. So how to talk to strangers without coming across as creepy?

The main factor is establishing familiarity, or making it negligibly important. If you frequent a bar or something, that establishes familiarity with other regulars. Makes you somewhat a known quantity that people feel more comfortable talking to than a stranger. I’ve met random women (not necessarily to date) just because they knew someone I knew at the bar and thus a connection was established that allowed us to talk without setting off social warning bells. Warning bells like “why is this random stranger talking to me, what do they want, this is the 4th dude that has come up to me this week.” 

Making familiarity negligible isn’t really something you *do* so much as the setting. Some social contexts, it’s expected that you will talk to strangers (local board game meetup) or ask them out (speed dating? Does that actually exist)? 

The gym is not the latter. So, you can really only find dates at the gym by establishing familiarity. Become a regular. Say hi to some of the other guys. Notice who you see frequently. Are any of them cute? Say hi to them too. Ask them for a spot when the guy you normally ask isn’t there or seems busy. Whatever seems natural. Just take it easy and treat them like a person. If they seem uncomfortable, back off! If you can’t tell when people are uncomfortable, practice, because you need that if you want to talk to relative strangers. Especially if you want to ask them out. 

The most important things: get to know people, respect their boundaries, don’t ask them out until you know them at least a little bit."
AskReddit,fc6w6zk,t1_fc6eftg,1577491071.0,"Not typically, but in this very thread people are saying they know women who dated or married someone they met at the gym. 

However, those stories usually come with “they were regulars and saw each other often.” In that circumstance, it becomes a lot more acceptable to start saying hi if you both recognize each other, exchange a few words, and if things go well, eventually ask her out!

The thing to avoid is going up to random girls and interrupting their workout as a complete stranger. At that point you’re just one of many people they have to extricate themselves from talking to that week.

So if there’s a cutie you want to talk to at you’re gym... guess you better start going often enough to be recognized! Oops, looks like you’re getting swole now too"
AskReddit,fc6vxhz,t1_fc6s2gw,1577490879.0,"It’s not paranoia. Why? Because it happens to people with some regularity. To me it’s analogous you being aware of the potential for mass shootings in crowded places. Is it paranoia? Well, mass shootings are relatively rare, but also not completely negligible. And the consequences of being caught in that situation are potentially severe. 

I mean shoot, people I know we’re at the Vegas concert shooting. Most women know someone who has been sexually assaulted, and all women know someone who has been harassed by a man in some way (catcalling, angry for turning him down, following them, etc). 

So no, you’re wrong. It’s a legit concern."
AskReddit,fc6vfoo,t1_fc61lix,1577490516.0,"I mean if they’re interesting and not creepy, sure!  If it happened multiple times per workout though, every time, it would get old. 

Then again, it’s all about cues. Am I wearing headphones? Did they make eye contact and give me a nod first? Am I resting between sets? All that stuff matters quite a bit honestly. 

If someone just comes up while I’ve got phones in mid squat and starts tapping me on the shoulder, it better be a fucking emergency!"
