There are a couple of things to note about mass extinction events: 

1) They fundamentally alter the variety of life on earth. For example, terrestrial dinosaur dominance before the Cretaceous-Paleogene (the ""giant fucking space rock"" you mention) giving way to terrestrial mammal and avian dinosaur dominance, or the Triassic-Jurassic event which led to the dominance of dinosaurs over most of their archosaur cousins and other terrestrial animals.

These events kill large swaths of all creatures. Yes, it will survive, but not in the form we know now. The incredibly biodiversity we witness today would be *easily* destroyed if we don't change our course.

The problem with our situation is that it's far from gradual on the timescale these usually operate on. Most animals cannot adapt to what we're putting them through. You're equating limited numbers of species dying off as a result of natural selection (which usually operates rather slowly and wouldn't produce the die-offs we are in the middle of witnessing as we speak) with the sort of dramatic, hard-to-adapt to change we're imposing.

Which does tend to circle back on us. If certain keystone species die off, even ones we don't even know about yet, we're all screwed, along with a large majority of other species."

Suppose you woke up one day and you were strapped to a gurney. There is a man hooked up next to you, and you are informed that your are keeping that man, who has a terrible kidney disease, alive by filtering his blood. You are informed that said man's life is entirely  sustained by your being strapped to that gurney against your will. Should you be able to extricate yourself from that situation? 

Another person's right to life is dependent on you, yes, but your right to your own body and how it's used and what it does supersedes the rights of that man. Nobody in their right mind would insist that you continue being strapped to the gurney if you didn't explicitly *want* to continue doing so; after all, being strapped down there and being connected to the guy could cause diseases and disorders in your own body! You can be compassionate towards that man while also not agreeing to sustain that person's life. 

Pro-choice is the position that whatever rights a fetus might have do not supersede the right of a woman to do what they wish with their bodies. It is the *only* ethical position. The opposite position is forcing women to go through a process which has a high likelihood of causes trauma and possible injury and even death, along with long-lasting physical and mental side-effects. And for what? If the woman cannot care for the child, and the child is put up for adoption, where they may or may not find a loving home, you're continuing a cycle of suffering. ""Pro-life"" is merely ""pro-birth"" and nothing more. As the legislators described above demonstrate, they don't give a rat's ass about what happens after the ""precious life is saved"".  It's a morally defunct position devoid of compassion."

There are a couple of things to note about mass extinction events: 

1) They fundamentally alter the variety of life on earth. For example, terrestrial dinosaur dominance before the Cretaceous-Paleogene (the ""giant fucking space rock"" you mention) giving way to terrestrial mammal and avian dinosaur dominance, or the Triassic-Jurassic event which led to the dominance of dinosaurs over most of their archosaur cousins and other terrestrial animals.

These events kill large swaths of all creatures. Yes, it will survive, but not in the form we know now. The incredibly biodiversity we witness today would be *easily* destroyed if we don't change our course.

The problem with our situation is that it's far from gradual on the timescale these usually operate on. Most animals cannot adapt to what we're putting them through. You're equating limited numbers of species dying off as a result of natural selection (which usually operates rather slowly and wouldn't produce the die-offs we are in the middle of witnessing as we speak) with the sort of dramatic, hard-to-adapt to change we're imposing.

Which does tend to circle back on us. If certain keystone species die off, even ones we don't even know about yet, we're all screwed, along with a large majority of other species."

The moral of the story is that you are free to carry a pregnancy to term if you so desire, but *don't fucking force YOUR morals on every single person in your community. Don't even dare to presume you have the authority to speak for anyone other than yourself.*

That is the essence of progressive policy. You can do as you like to yourself, but don't force your morality onto anyone else's autonomy."
Iowa,fem1hjm,t1_felkcai,1579236697.0,"Yes, because forcing someone to go through with a pregnancy =/= telling someone what they can and can't do with their body.

Except that's exactly what it is. The idea that anyone can put an unborn human's rights, who has no responsibilities, above a fully developed woman's personal right to decide what she is going to do with her own body is repulsive.

By putting the right of a fetus above the right of a woman to choose, you're basically telling us that you think a woman is basically just a womb with no agency as to whether or not they're pregnant. Women aren't fucking *brood mares.*"

Fucking chud."
Iowa,fem0ygw,t1_felvm9c,1579236230.0,"Being pro-choice isn't being pro-murder. I'm also an atheist, and how you came to such an illogical opinion baffles me.

A though experiment, if you would:

Suppose you woke up one day and you were strapped to a gurney. There is a man hooked up next to you, and you are informed that your are keeping that man, who has a terrible kidney disease, alive by filtering his blood. You are informed that said man's life is entirely  sustained by your being strapped to that gurney against your will. Should you be able to extricate yourself from that situation? 

Another person's right to life is dependent on you, yes, but your right to your own body and how it's used and what it does supersedes the rights of that man. Nobody in their right mind would insist that you continue being strapped to the gurney if you didn't explicitly *want* to continue doing so; after all, being strapped down there and being connected to the guy could cause diseases and disorders in your own body! You can be compassionate towards that man while also not agreeing to sustain that person's life. 

Pro-choice is the position that whatever rights a fetus might have do not supersede the right of a woman to do what they wish with their bodies. It is the *only* ethical position. The opposite position is forcing women to go through a process which has a high likelihood of causes trauma and possible injury and even death, along with long-lasting physical and mental side-effects. And for what? If the woman cannot care for the child, and the child is put up for adoption, where they may or may not find a loving home, you're continuing a cycle of suffering. ""Pro-life"" is merely ""pro-birth"" and nothing more. As the legislators described above demonstrate, they don't give a rat's ass about what happens after the ""precious life is saved"".  It's a morally defunct position devoid of compassion."

Warren may get more donations from women than men, but more women donated to Bernie's campaign in 2019. We *have* a progressive candidate with a great shot at winning the primary and the general. Warren had her shot to take the reigns, but she slumped back to moderate policy and dropping any semblance of wanting to do something like Bernie's doing, and her poll numbers shrank accordingly."
ElizabethWarren,fegsuk3,t1_fegr612,1579101744.0,"For what? Denying a slanderous statement that's only meant to cause doubt among democratic voters less than a month before the election?

You know as well as I do that if there was something said to that effect, it was probably taken out of context, and trying to explain it would just make the headlines ""Bernie Hates Women!""  The smartest thing to do is to deny it entirely, because it gets the point across that even if something was misunderstood, the message is clear that Bernie doesn't believe that a woman couldn't become President."

ElizabethWarren,fefxl7c,t1_fefvy67,1579068564.0,"I'm disappointed. I'd still consider her my number 2 pick after Bernie, but this whole fiasco should have been nipped in the bud by Warren before it ended up causing a major rift between the two major progressive candidates. In this time of the campaign season, we need a unifying progressive movement, not a he said, she said situation about a quote which, if it occurred at all, may be a large misunderstanding.

If Bernie said  something, I'm pretty sure it would have to do with doubts regarding how demographics would affect the ability of a woman to successfully be elected, but I doubt it, seeing as how everyone involved acknowledges how even Clinton, as lackluster of a candidate she was, still won the popular vote.

This whole thing just comes off as petty."
