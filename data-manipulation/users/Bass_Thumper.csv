 Why are Republicans refusing to call witnesses? Is it because it would be damaging to their case? Because witnesses would incriminate him like the other dozen witnesses? Why is Trump telling his administration to deny lawful subpoenas? You know that is illegal right? You know withholding Congressionally approved aid is also illegal, right?"

The only time i really use high humidity is when i propagate clones because they need to take in water through the leaves until the develop roots. This isn't as much of a problem with seedlings because they have a nice little tap root under them to absorb water."

anime,fevbvk5,t1_ferinpt,1579395550.0,"Thanks man, it's just like, my opinion. Phantom Troupe are a bunch of hyper elite one dimensional characters while LoV have been changing and growing throughout the series, especially Shigaraki. He goes from being incompetent and getting caught in his hideout with no plan to forming a group that he actually cares about and coming out on top in this recent episode."
anime,fevbcb7,t1_ferv8p5,1579395338.0,I mean they came out on top this time unlike the hideout raid arc.

I could have very easily beaten the absolute shit out of every single woman who has touched me.

Want to know why i didn't? Because i would have gotten in much more trouble than them, probably taken to jail."

anime,feqkylk,t1_feqgwte,1579343001.0,I honestly like them better than the Phantom Troupe. I love watching them grow and adapt as the series progresses. The Phantom Troupe were elite from the very beginning. They do remind me of them though.
microgrowery,feph7u9,t1_feojwxq,1579320420.0,"That is veg, flower it says 40%-50% I normally try to keep mine around 40%-50% the entire grow unless I am propagating clones which need to absorb water through the leaves since they have no roots. The only problem you will really have from high humidity on a plant with roots is you'll need to water more frequently. 30%-40% is a little dry but fine for flowering imo, I don't really worry about it unless it's getting as low as like 20s. I've even grown tons of seedlings at 40%

During late flowering, like after week 4 or so even 30% is fine."
microgrowery,fepfzkl,t3_eq6qtn,1579319543.0,"I normally wait a lil longer personally, like maybe a week or two more. I can show you some pics of a few of my plants before flip and after stretching [here.](https://imgur.com/a/ywjGX7O) I mostly grow indica strains though, so if you are growing Sativa dominant strains you may need to account for extra stretch room."
microgrowery,fep9532,t3_eq8y7q,1579314921.0,I would top it and clone it. You have 3 growth shoots coming out of every node instead of 2? I would definitely try to preserve those genetics. Even if it turns out to be male you could try a controlled breeding and see if this gene is passed on.
