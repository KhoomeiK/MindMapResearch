Not important as long as it's not a ridiculously chunky gaming laptop

They're always compromising performance for durability, it's a constant tradeoff. Especially in offshore racing, but even in the America's cup you have to make it through the race.

That being said, I don't think collision-proof foils are going to win this race. There are enough boats that someone with a lighter build will most likely make it around, and I'm guessing foils designed to handle that kind of impact would have to be way slower."
