Gwendolyn Christie, just explained.

Benicia del toro, who was he again and why was he in the movie?

Laura Dern, she got to play “stern leader #3”, at least I think that’s what her characters name was.

Oscar Isaac is incredible yet Poe was completely underutilized. You could tell just how much damn charm and chemistry he had by tRoS but by then they had already bungled any semblance of his character (shoehorning in some spice running nonsense and the masked chick like he’s got some history, but then doing nothing with it).

Adam Driver is amazing and by far shouldered this entire trilogy’s reputation when it comes to acting, but I still feel like they just didn’t do Kylo Ren/Ben Solo justice in terms of plot line. His scene with Han showed how much emotional weight his story could’ve had, but got flubbed by a vanilla and dispassionate redemption.
