HistoryMemes,ffe9fke,t1_ffe549r,1579840356.0,"My point was that you have to take Dresden in the context of the allied bombing and the entire war. Dresden was an effort taken within that context, so to me asking if it’s justified is missing the point entirely. Dresden may or may not have been a good decision, but bad decisions in this context are still justified ones. 

If you think the allied bombing campaign was justified, then hopefully you can see where Dresden fit within the logic of that campaign and the way that campaign was fought. Germany hadn’t surrendered yet, better targets were destroyed or believed destroyed, cities in general were targeted when better targets weren’t found, and doing so was part of campaign to force Germany to devote resources on air defenses while also destroying as much of those as possible. 

Dresden happened in the context of a much bigger war and you can look at it in that context. Going as hard in on the bombing as we did was extremely costly to us tremendously, but that bombing campaign was linked to efforts to destroy to Luftwaffe and it also had a major effect in diverting resources. Germany at the end of the war needed to be made to divert and spread out its air defense resources, most of which were costly, limited, and generally also could have been used in the ground war. 

Every bombing raid, every bomber, every bomb, all had varied results. Some of those results were better than others. Some were accidental, some were tragic, some were planned, and some were even planned badly. That was never going to be avoided. We did the best we could in context, and I think that people focus on Dresden out of context too much. Within that framing it’s perfectly sensible, but it’s not a very sensible way to look at the issue or even a very sensible issue to focus on.

Americans and allied were dying in droves, and European civilians were dying even more. You can’t exoect people to just stop in a war like that while others are fighting and when the enemy hasn’t given up."

There’s nothing wrong with not liking this or that decision but you need to keep a sense of context and proportion. Trying to win the war unconditionally was absolutely the right thing to do. Dresden being destroyed is a detail to argue about in the big picture of stopping the Nazis, not a scandal to bash the US with.

Edit: of the over sixty million dead in that war, at least eighty percent of those were killed by the axis. It’s time to stop blaming the good guys for fighting the best they could, for having to make tough decisions under time pressure, and for being imperfect. The longer it took to stop that war the more innocent people would have been killed by the axis."

It might require resetting the political process but ideally it would build on the best parts of the current process. 

Obviously this kind of thing can go wrong, and it can do so in all sorts of ways, but not interventions can go wrong also. I think the recent history of this particular country illustrates that well. Perhaps things might not have gotten this bad if someone did something decisive at some point in the past, but we can never know. What I think we do know is that this has become a perpetually bad situation that could get far far worse very quickly. 

I think that options should be on the table, and I think a lot of countries have an interest in this situation, especially when you consider what kinds of things could happen if things get worse. I’m all for letting internal politics play out, but this has gone well past the point where it started spilling over into the region. 

If we were to have higher standards for countries like Venezuela, then we would consider that it is and has not been a properly functioning state with a government that’s legitimate internally and externally. We should at least recognize that the situation in the country is creating problems and risks for neighboring countries, and we should consider the people suffering within Venezuela. 

I’m not calling for any specific country to act, and I confess I haven’t done any operational planning on the issue, but if you wanted some kind of possible strategy I would say get as large of a footprint as you can in the worst affected or best connected urban areas and ink blot out to provide security and aid while capturing the oil fields and other natural resources to ensure maximum production to help keep the economy in a spot where it can be rebuilt (and maybe to help offset the cost of the operation in the long term, like paying back a loan) if that’s what it takes to ensure that enough forces and supplies can get there without the wrong strings getting attached. After that I’d say find some pretext to force a referendum on whether to try and empower the existing regionally recognized government or to start over. Basically stabilize and leave, possibly securing repayment from Venezuela once and only if they are thriving. 

However, it obviously takes a lot more consideration, planning and negotiation for that to ever happen than a Reddit post, should it be the thing to do. I’m not entirely sure it is, but I don’t think things are likely to get better for anybody without someone doing something significant, and I think it might get worse if they don’t. It’s possible that people would have benefited if more countries had done more sooner, and I don’t think it’s a sober call to dogmatically write off military options in this situation, but on a political level I feel like that may be happening throughout the region."

Part of the issue here might be the Islamic legal system of Saudi Arabia. Another might be how little Arabs like public displays of contrition or admittance, which I’m probably over stating but I that I think does exist. From a western perspective this might sound like an insult, but within the context of their culture it makes sense and can work out, although it might be creating a problem here. Or it might all be the result of Arab nationalism being so new. I don’t know. 

What I do know is that I don’t think my country would be better off if we lost influence in Saudi Arabia. Whatever you think of them, and given how one sided the coverage of them is I think I can guess what that is, but I don’t think anyone can make a good honest case for Saudi Arabia being a better place or playing a better role in the world if they lost their connections to America or if they moved closer to our competitors and enemies.

This conflict has been going on for years and most people haven’t been paying attention. It’s only an issue now because their are political narratives being pushed to further an agenda.

Why would I think that? Because the Ayatollah is being careful with his words, and he’s playing harmless political theater. Harmless political theater is precisely what the US wants from the regime. If they can save face while mollifying their hardliners without letting them do harm, that’s so preferable to the regime having those hard liners do violence. 

This is such good news. The Ayatollah is looking tough by harmlessly talking shit about Trump and Trump doesn’t have to do jack because it’s not a direct insult or serious threat to the American people.

They also don’t really see Ukraine specifically as its own country. Many see the region in general, and Kiev in particular, as they birthplace of Russian identity and culture. It’s also a strategically valuable area that many Russians, across many generations, have died fighting over, often in the name of protecting Russia. Look at the Russian casualties in Ukraine during World War 2. Many Russians believe Ukraine is Russian and it’s not a new phenomenon."

The situation in Syria is better than its been in years, even for Kurds, who are now being seen as partners by the Syrian government.

The other thing with the Phobos Librarian is that I think they still have the Deathwing keyword so some of the new traits, stratagems and relics would work with him."

Over a thousand years ago, a Muslim royal’s family was overthrown and murdered, but he escaped into exile. He made it to Spain. He became a ruler. He could never could go home, but he built his palace so that the columns looked like trees, the palm trees that he missed. That was part of the cultural mingling that made Spain what it is.

WarhammerCompetitive,fei5kiu,t1_fei4tue,1579130772.0,"That’s not a very nice way to start off a reply. I completely agree what you that a game being easy is important to new players, but it’s certainly not everything, and that’s not the case that was being made anyways. 

New players have so many games to choose from. If easy was everything to them they wouldn’t be playing 40K. It’s expensive, it has modeling and painting, it’s hard to transport, it has books full of rules, there’s math and lots of decisions to make before the game even starts, and games themselves can take hours. People are not coming to this edition like they are merely because it’s so easy. 

People need to want to play a game. Once they do the game does need to be easy to play. GWs newer management has done a great job at making the game easier and more streamlined than past editions, but the only people who knew about that aspect of things were existing players. No one is going to buy into a new game mainly because a new edition is easier than an edition that they have never played. They don’t have that frame of reference."
WarhammerCompetitive,fehysnl,t1_fehyh4p,1579126603.0,"> 8th edition fundamentally cleaned up how armor saves work, made vehicles not a pain in the ass to deal with, simplified the detachments system, and brought an entire new line of space marines

Only one of those things means anything to new players, and per the competitive scene Marines were next to unplayable for years. I honestly don’t think that GW is basing its decisions solely off of old players, and if the Marines were selling then it shows how little the competitive scene relates to the rest of the game. Competitive should be trying to embrace and encourage new players, not a circle jerk for old players."
WarhammerCompetitive,fehy3wb,t1_fehnn4g,1579126190.0,"I think you are greatly over selling the cons of soup, as soup is still part of a game and I don’t think it’s a real problem. You are free to disagree, but honestly it feels like this community is so opposed to anyone saying anything different that the anti soup mentality is just a left over from two years ago before it was fixed, but it’s the “right” opinion so it still gets repeated despite the game developing in a direction that addressed all the old complaints."
WarhammerCompetitive,fehxtve,t1_fehna0j,1579126025.0,The sales increases are significant to a degree that I think suggest new interest in the game. I think many new players were more attracted to soup because it let them play more of the models they might like than we’re attracted to game changes compared to an edition that they didn’t play.

Mixing armies can be a really fun, interesting, complex and creative way to build an army, and it lets you play more of the models you want play. Having fewer kinds of armies and no mixing will not lead to more variety in the long term. I could be happy for numerous rules changes that have limited soup and that were supporting of mono builds because I’m happy people who want to play a mono faction to do so, but those people shouldn’t get to design the game at the expense of others and instead of GW."
