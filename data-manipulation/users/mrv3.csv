""LORD HAILEY And I speak, not as one interested in bureaucracy, but as one interested in facts. The actual facts with regard to export are that in the first seven months of 1943 only 21,000 tons of wheat and 70,000 tons of rice were exported to Ceylon, the Persian Gulf or the Arabian ports. Of course, those are comparatively small figures. And it was 274officially denied on behalf of the Government of India that there had been this alleged export of 300,000 tons of rice from Bengal to other parts.""

You mischaracterise the situation, export happened largely before the famine as the situations severity in Bengal worsened and became widespread a large quantity was returned.

Thank you for agreeing with me, Churchill did not go ""When officials asked him about the famine it he replied "" Why hasn't Gandhi died yet? """" as per the other commenters suggestion. Gandhi wasn't really involved in Bengal to my knowledge nor was he in Bengal. Gandhi did however allow his wife to die by refusing her medicine but took some himself shortly before this telegram by Churchill.

Our boy won't do better, the same way the kill death ratio in Iraq and Vietnam wasn't in their favour. Yet they still won.

Vietnam won. American soldiers where well armed, equipped, and trained. How?"

We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas.

I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.""-Churchill
