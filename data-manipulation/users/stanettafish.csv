PublicFreakout,fc4bey5,t1_fc4b5l2,1577411816.0,OMG I totally missed that gem! Obliged to you.
languagelearning,fc4aoe2,t1_fc4a3ke,1577411218.0,"Yep. There are actually way more resources for learning Croatian than there are for the related languages, which is why I'm focusing mainly on it. I didn't start with Serbian because I don't want to deal with the Cyrillic alphabet at the same time. I'm already pretty overwhelmed trying to trill my rs. 

Eventually I'll learn Cyrillic though so I'll be able to read street signs and menus and such."
PublicFreakout,fc4a3ws,t3_eg1ev1,1577410765.0,"LOL.

languagelearning,fc48j1f,t1_fc2ldjv,1577409509.0,"But then I'd need to shower daily! 

Just kidding. That's another great suggestion about Wikipedia pages. Thank you. This is the first time I've learned a new language so I'm kinda clueless. And I'm studying Croatian so there aren't a lot of resources. But I have joined every sub here that uses my target language. I'll learn Croatian or die trying."

Epstein,fc1fl03,t1_fbyh1aq,1577317286.0,"Presumably Spacey has inside knowledge of fellow pedos, so he wouldn't need to learn about it from public disclosures."
Epstein,fc1fh3a,t1_fbz9mzs,1577317192.0,Right. Wasn't it Prince Andrew who invited Spacey to do so?
Epstein,fc1f73w,t1_fc1eaiy,1577316953.0,You may be right. You're likely right. But telling people to stop thinking and only accept your narrative makes you an asshole.
conspiracy,fc1dwcr,t1_fc1brzz,1577315840.0,Good observation.
Epstein,fc1dn89,t3_efmvjw,1577315626.0,Was that a voodoo fire Spacey was stoking in his latest creeper video?
