I just looked it up, sorry I didn’t do more research on my first comment.

Mutually Assured Destruction is a term that is associated with Nuclear War, but I was pretty sure that wasn’t the name of the nuclear doctrine.

Also I feel like it’s a big part of any large-scale wars in the future not getting “hot,” but I feel like my opinion of that is changing the more China starts to resemble Nazi Germany."

MurderedByWords,fctwf5q,t1_fcttb2t,1577962993.0,"This is actually a good point to be fair.

I’m really tired of some people treating politics like a football game and partisanship like their favorite team.

*My team’s quarterback is better than your teams quarterback! Your coach is trash because it’s not my teams coach! Fuck that other team’s player for sacking our QB like he’s supposed to!*

I swear people are just wearing jerseys at this point. It’s dehumanizing. Fewer and fewer are looking at people as individuals or worse yet, *policies as individual.* 

People judge people by their partisanship. If they aren’t my team, they are the enemy.

And they judge policies the same way. If its something my team backs, I’ll argue it to the end, my own opinions and life experience be damned.

This is extra dangerous because I am convinced that most of our politicians, regardless of their fucking *team,* are in it to stay in office at this point. Stagnation. We aren’t making policies to build the world up when we’re so busy tearing each other down.

Anyone who uses “the left” or “the right” in their attack is part of the problem, even if they aren’t wrong in their attacks."

CasualConversation,fctp0mo,t3_eipy4z,1577952244.0,"Not that I disagree with quitting social media at all, it is definitely a necessity in plenty of situations for plenty of people, but I feel that the real issue here is your friend..

Like it seems shallow and unnatural to ignore people like that. Everyone I know and communicate with treat social media like a different type of conversation; which is exactly what it is. You don’t walk away from a conversation out of nowhere unless angry or something else comes up, and at least the latter usually comes with an explanation.

And the fact that asking if you’d upset them didn’t prompt any further conversation is a huge red flag to me. Like that’s a *we need to fix this because someone is upset* conversation starter in the internet age, and if they just let that slide then something’s up.

Like if a close friend of mine reads me on read mid-conversation or after a meme has been sent or something similar,  I’ma give them shit for it, and not have to feel scared of doing so. This is usually followed by “Oh shit! It didn’t send!” or they just forgot or whatever.

Whoever this is seems distant and uncaring, and probably not a good friend to have in the first place. They strike me far more as the problem than the social media.

That being said if it is making you feel better OP, then hell yeah! I just thought I’d toss in two cents."
