I actually saw pretty much what you described in theatre form at the Edinburgh Fringe festival last year. It was called The Visitors. Except the thoughts interact with the human, and not each other. I enjoyed it. 

Here's their description:

>The Visitors is an original play which centres around a night in the life of heroin addict Danny Strand as he attempts to rekindle his old flare for life. Past, present and future collide as five vastly different visitors attempt to guide him through his addiction (pain, desire, euphoria, comfort and paranoia), causing him to question his choices and how other people are affected by his downward spiral. Equal parts humourous and morbid, The Visitors explores sexuality, addiction and loneliness. Part A Christmas Carol, part Fight Club; this piece is not your conventional play about drugs.

I don't know but if you're actually interested enough in this idea you could contact the creators, maybe they would even let you read the script or something."
