Denver,fgsxxze,t1_fgsvqmg,1581094955.0,"That goes to a couple of things--a lack of understanding logic and fallacies (so basic reasoning skills) as well as a lack of understanding of the scientific method.

There has been junk science, but that occurs when the scientific method is not adhered to (e.g., cherry-picking data, making assumptions, starting with a conclusion and assembling facts to support it, which is what they do). 

I'm not sure that science is settled as it regards the rising incidences of peanut and other allergies though."

I remember the first time I heard about restrictions around collecting rainwater on your property. I was pissed about it and thought it was an infringement.

In 2008 a radical court overturned that 1938 ruling in favor of a new interpretation of it as an individual right in the Heller ruling. So for almost 70 years the collective interpretation was the law of the land. The individual interpretation is relatively new, about 12 years old."

I feel no need to prove anything. You can debate that the Amendment was intended as an individual and not a collective right (though historical context and the preponderance of precedent both weigh in favor of a reading as a collective right, as does the otherwise curious preface of ""A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state"").

BravoTopChef,fgisctd,t1_fgirxlc,1580829839.0,"Same. I think we may be in the minority but perhaps I'm wrong. They could still have the BS house drama if they feel they need something to entice people who aren't culinary nerds. 

The fact that they run commercials and have sponsors like Hidden Valley Ranch makes me think there's a chunk of the viewership that are not into food that much."
BravoTopChef,fgiqba9,t3_eyji4e,1580828487.0,"General observation: Top Chef challenges are often really more indicative of catering skills than cooking skills, particularly when they move the goalposts or change the game mid-flight. I say this not just because many challenges literally are catering, but because catering often involves things not going as planned and adaptation, much more so than the controlled circumstances of a commercial kitchen.

A lot of chefs ply their trade entirely in commercial kitchens with well-stocked pantries, so pretending that using a hot plate at a camp site is an honest assessment of the same skills is a fundamental issue with the show if it truly seeks to determine who among a group is the ""top chef"" (and is not instead a way to entice viewership/advertisers and discover telegenic chefs and make money off them). One thing I do like about it is the invention that these contrived circumstances force, but I'm not going to pretend that it's telling me who the most skilled chef is. Show me what you can do in the environment you'll be using when I patronize your restaurant--that to me is a ""top chef"" but admittedly would make for boring TV.

I also think restaurant wars incorporates a lot of stuff that has nothing to do with ""cooking skill"" (FOH), but I suppose their definition of a chef includes running a restaurant so perhaps that's defensible."
