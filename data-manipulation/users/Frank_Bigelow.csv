And they are. By your reasoning, *you're* the ""whataboutist"" for saying ""but Iran is shitty too."" Now, I'm not saying that, because the comparison is relevant and valid, but I am saying shut up about whataboutism, the comparison is what the conversation is about."

One could argue that, for the first time, we have a repository of information which could at least plausibly be preserved in some form or other for as long as humanity exists. Being remembered for as long as humanity exists seems pretty awesome to me, even if that almost certainly is just a blip on a cosmic timescale."
