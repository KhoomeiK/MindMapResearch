mormon,ffcp5ju,t3_esw4se,1579804228.0,"In my town, there was a nonprofit organization that coordinated a shelter and food for male homeless individuals (as females and children had a dedicated shelter).  They had a transport vehicle to take individuals to a place where cots were set up that they could sleep the night in and also eat dinner and breakfast in the morning. 
The building they used was an LDS church that was no longer being used (but still owned by the church).  I volunteered there twice a year through a sign up sheet that got passed around in our ward. The volunteers would arrive to make dinner, slept there, and made breakfast in the morning.  We took shifts to cover a night.  The other wards participated as well, as did other churches in the community.  For someone to stay at the shelter, they had to not be drunk or on drugs, which was determined by the non-profit prior to transport.  I don't know how typical that situation is, but I thought it was cool that the church provided the building for the people to sleep in, as well as the volunteers to cook and supervise.  We also brought the food to cook.  I don't know how widely this type of thing is practiced, but it was pretty cool to be a part of it.  And that was through the church.  I think the model of having the church and its members act as a resource to a non-profit whose main focus is on homelessness is a great one that should be expanded."

This chart doesn't have actual numbers, but the 1990 to 2010 charts look close to having twice the percent of non-whites being convicted of over 280 grams.  That would explain the higher rate.

mormon,fcuualq,t3_ej0xd5,1577988643.0,"Not really.  The concept of indulgences comes from the Catholic notion of being punished for sin in purgatory.  Under Catholic theology, there is a period of time after death called ""purgatory"", where people are punished for their sins before they can move on to heaven.  An indulgence (whether that is the payment of money or saying prayers or some other act) reduces that time of punishment.  They actually quantified the amount of time in days or years, which could be reduced or avoided altogether based on the act performed.  Over time, this led to abuses that Martin Luther decried and that the Catholic church has tried to reform.     

The Mormon concept of the afterlife, and especially exaltation, is different.  There is no purgatory or state of punishment for sins that have already been forgiven.  Exaltation is based on ordinances and keeping the commandments.  While it is true that exaltation requires ordinances, those will be received by everyone either during their life or after they die regardless of their choices during their lives.  This is true (and more likely to happen quickly) of Mormons who didn't receive those ordinances during their lives (usually done by family members after they die).    

To Mormons, tithing is a commandment, just like any other.  Going to the temple requires someone to assert that they are worthy to attend, which means in general that they keep the commandments, including tithing.  It is only one of the requirements to attend the temple and one of the questions to enter (the question is ""Are you a full tithe payer?""... and ""full tithe payer"" is not defined clearly).  So exaltation is not purchased, paying tithing does not reduce time in ""purgatory"", which does not exist under Mormon theology, and paying tithing is certainly not the only test of being worthy to enter the temple (which is symbolic of coming into the presence of the Lord)."

AskHistorians,fcnywnp,t1_fb3ni1g,1577821100.0,"Peasant life in China was pretty rough prior to the revolution, and basically just on the verge of subsistence/starvation.  First, a large percent of the population were tenant farmers, meaning they farmed land owned by landlords.  A large percent of those who owned land were indebted, and would lose their land to the lenders (usually the landlords).  The landlords charged an average of 46% of crops in rent, with those rates as high as 60% in some areas.  When crops suffered, Tenants were forced to borrow money to survive... usually from the same landlords who they paid rent to.  Interest rates were generally between 36% and 84% per year, but were often much higher.  During World War II, the communists abandoned the more radical land reform initiatives (like redistribution), but they did advocate for reductions in rent and a cap on interest rates.  They were successful in doing so, in large part as a means of reaching agreement with the KMT on ceasing hostilities in light of Japan's invasion, and also because the KMT had little presence in the northern areas.  Local landlords relied on the communists for protection and assistance and remote landlords had little contact/control.  This helped alleviate life for peasants and spread the goodwill of communists to the peasant masses."
