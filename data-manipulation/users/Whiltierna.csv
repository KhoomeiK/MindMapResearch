Consistency is the biggest thing, especially with ZERO tolerance. When I take them on walks, I walk in all directions, turning around and around and around so they can't predict and must follow. This means the communication I am giving them is where my legs go, they go. I release them to sniff at the places I know they want, so they don't pull to the rock at the corner because they know if they follow me they will get it.

On my YouTube channel, Whiltierna - The Patient Pet Parent, I have a playlist of Zak George's dog training with links in each description that I highly recommend.

Lure training is to lead the dogs nose to what you want and connect a signal to it. 

The best communication I built with my dogs is for them to think, ""i want that, so if i sit, I'll get it, maybe."" So I hold their water bowl when I refill it, they sit and look at me, and I release them from the sit. They get what they want and know what they have to do. This came from consistently not lowering the bowl until they sat. I didn't want water knocked all over, so I was patient and they sat faster each time.

Training isn't easy not because the dogs are difficult. Training isn't easy because you want results. Work on the communication and the results will come. It takes time, effort, and patience, but I believe in you!"
