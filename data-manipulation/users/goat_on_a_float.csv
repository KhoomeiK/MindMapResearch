AskSF,ffbc03g,t3_esowjd,1579759083.0,"Traveling solo is mostly safe, just keep your wits about you and don’t walk around staring at your phone, especially late at night or while on BART / in a station.  I would not recommend driving here, though.  Traffic and parking are terrible, and lots of window smash and grabs happen every day.  Whatever you do, if you do drive, do not leave anything in your car.

I support safe injection sites with regulated doses, but think that when someone smashes a window to score cash for a stash they should be treated harshly.  Put the dealers out of business, and provide treatment for addicts if they want it."
bayarea,ff8c0in,t1_ff8bk64,1579672402.0,"So, what should we do with them?  Fentanyl does kill people, and dealers seem mostly indifferent to that.  I understand that we have a demand problem.  But if we let dealers go free, we would need to find a way to rehabilitate them, which seems difficult.  Why would you work an unskilled job for minimum wage when you can make much more selling poison?  Give the average dealer 2 weeks working fast food, and they’ll be out dealing again.  I guess we could give them free housing outside of prison, and shit on honest unskilled workers in the Bay Area.  That doesn’t sound like the best option either."
oakland,ff8bh6y,t1_ff8b9so,1579671861.0,"That may or may not be true, and it depends on how you define violent crime.  But I would argue that anyone willing to steal your property might be willing to harm you in the process if necessary."

The dealers, who were caught with multiple bundles of drugs for sale, were sentenced to between 4 and 12 months behind bars!  Most are already out on time served, but I’m sure they’re completely rehabilitated by now and ready to contribute to society. /s"
science,ff84sn7,t1_ff84ljk,1579665992.0,Just mostly them.  Mostly.
oakland,ff84nyt,t1_ff7s8i0,1579665894.0,"I agree, but I’m not sure what the solution is at this point.  Yes, we need more affordable housing and better schools.  We need better policing, and longer sentences for violent crime.  I worry, though, that the teens and young adults who are committing these crimes are largely a lost generation.  Just locking them up forever seems like a bad solution, but I think the odds of rehabilitation for most of these offenders are pretty low.

A couple years ago I had a conversation in which a friend described SF as dystopian, but I think SF is now largely post-dystopian.  Oakland is the new dystopia, with rich people living in secured communities, poor people struggling to survive, and the middle class caught in between.  I don’t see a good solution, and that’s very troubling to me."

It’s unlikely to happen, but it would be the right thing to do.  I’m old enough to have lost hope that it will happen, but I don’t think that makes my proposal wrong.

bayarea,ff58qt5,t1_ff54b86,1579583598.0,"Resources are, by definition, limited.  But relatively speaking, I think there’s enough money in the Bay Area to handle homelessness.  We don’t need to build luxury accommodations for homeless people, and a lot of the cost associated with building low income housing is related to a complex permitting process and wealthy homeowners who don’t want the problem solved.  We should house the people who need housing, and give mandatory treatment to people who are unable to take care of themselves.  And we should prosecute crime much more aggressively.  We could do all of this if we had the political will to do it, but the Bay Area is too content to let billionaires be billionaires, to let people sleep in the streets, and to let organized thugs smash the car windows of the working poor."

bayarea,fepx4cc,t1_fepwi5w,1579333937.0,"I also, admittedly, skimped on research (I was not involved in the case).  I did just read the opinion, and in a weird way, it might be a good thing.  If BART were liable for damages for assaults on trains, they might improve their security posture.  I still disagree with the ruling, but this opens the door for suits brought by people who have been assaulted while on a train.  I am not a lawyer, and would be interested in hearing your opinion."
bayarea,fepuoid,t3_eqc0av,1579331945.0,"The legal reasoning here makes no sense.  I haven’t read the ruling (and I probably will this weekend), but if the reasoning is that BART is responsible for the safety of passengers when on a train, but not on the platform (after a passenger has paid and passed through the fare gates) seems incredibly wrong headed.  BART would probably do better to argue that they have no responsibility for the safety of passengers anywhere within their transit system.

This should probably be appealed.  Had BART argued that they are not responsible for the safety of passengers anywhere, that might pass muster.  The distinction between someone who has already entered the paid area and someone on a train sounds flawed to me.  I also wonder if passengers who are attacked on a train could use this as precedent.

Edit: I wonder if citations for “eating, drinking, smoking or playing loud music” could be fought on these grounds, as long as they happen on the platform and not on the train.  Not that I plan to eat at a BART station anytime soon, but they can’t have it both ways."

networking,feps6lw,t3_eqcvyo,1579329461.0,"VoIP calls are generally only traceable back to your (VoIP) carrier — though your carrier can trace it back to you.  Ultimately, if you’re calling someone over VoIP and the endpoint has a regular phone number, you will need an interface back to the PSTN (publicly switched telephone network), which means you need a carrier.  Use of some free services and a VPN might make it hard for them to find you, though.

Edit: we may need a bit more information to answer this.  Different VoIP services work differently.  Spoofing caller ID is very easy to do, and tracing can be hard.  Are you trying to fool an average person?  That’s easy enough, and law enforcement isn’t going to get involved if you don’t do anything really nefarious.  Are you trying to fool a celebrity or state actor?  Involved in serious crime?  They’ll probably find you.  That is, if you live in a jurisdiction that gives a shit."
