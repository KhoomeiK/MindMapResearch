You’ll learn lots of communications and interaction skills.  Surprisingly, humor is optional.   Those skills are valuable in all social interactions. 

This will go a long way to helping you build a life for yourself.   After you have your own life created, girls will be more interested in you."

If you are consistently 1% better every day, you would be 34.54x better after a year.

The point is that a minor, perhaps imperceptible, improvement compounds into significant improvements after time."
BoJackHorseman,feoh3sc,t3_eq4h7l,1579299996.0,All you need is to be 1% better each day.

getdisciplined,feioupm,t3_ep5amg,1579143560.0,"It seems that a lot of new age philosophy is erroneous interpretation of older philosophy like Buddhism. I’ve been re-listening to Alan Watts lectures. One of the points he makes is that, yes, you are a god, but most people who learn this go off and do stupid stuff because they don’t really understand what that means in the Buddhist interpretation, a lot like you described above.  Some of the other bad points you describe also seem like severe distortions of eastern philosophy.

One good thing that does seem to have gotten through got into stoicism; the idea that all of life is a natural flow that should not be resisted but should be followed. Fighting against the natural order of the universe is a bad idea.  Suffering is the dissatisfaction of trying to challenge the natural order. Acceptance is the key.

The primary mechanism involves collagen and vitamin C rather than cholesterol, and most people get far too little, if any, collagen protein. 

Going one step further, the blood vessel walls tend to get damaged from excessive inflammation due to our diets, especially from plant based oils and sugars.

Get a dialogue going between the parts. Ask one part or voice what it wants. Then role play that part / voice. Ask your logical part what it needs. Then role play that part. Continue the role playing and discuss between the parts. See if the parts can come to an mutual agreement, or see if you can destroy the position of a negative part by showing how it’s not helping but actually hurting.
