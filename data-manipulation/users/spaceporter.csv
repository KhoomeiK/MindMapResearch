However, if you have 7 properties that each cover 115% of rent, each with similar odds of being vacant for 3 or 4 months, odds that are very low, then owning 7 tends to be less risky (though obviously with each person the maximum potential loss increases) than 1.

pics,ffs6gle,t1_ffs47vy,1580174314.0,"Your bold point is flatly wrong. The carbon output of the tar sands per barrel is far higher than from Saudi Arabia or West Texas. In West Texas, because they’ve gone heavily into wind and the clearance system that favours wind, much of the oil pumping and refinement energy use is renewable. It isn’t great and angers a lot of environmentalists who see it as turning wind into oil but relative to AB it is downright clean. AB could explicitly have a similar set up, and although tar sands would still be dirtier, they’d be cleaner than now. This isn’t happening and I think we know why.

pics,ffrq0wr,t1_ffrlfwj,1580163270.0,"You are making several very fallacious arguments. You are both presupposing that the output of China is separate from the output of Canada in the sense that reducing the output of one country occurs in a vacuum without affecting the output of other countries. We saw immediately after Trump erroneously (when he entered office not understanding there was a delay) declared he was leaving the Paris Accords and Australia along with several developing countries made similar, albeit not the same, declarations. I find it very likely that if Canada pursued an aggressive net zero emissions policy it would reduce emissions in China as well through shared technology, soft power, and signalling to the international community about us also being serious about climate change.

You are also conflating maximum amount of emissions reductions possible with simplicity of reducing emissions. Yes, of course I'd remove all of China's emissions before all of Canada's because it is a larger share; however, it is easier for Canada do reduce its emissions by 1 Mt than for China to do the same given our capacity. It is also easier for use to unilaterally reduce our CO2e output by 1 Mt unilaterally than to impose such reduction targets on China. We are at a different point on our environmental Kuznet curve than they are. 

You are also presupposing in your (frankly terrible) analogy that these are equally plausible and equally priced options. Outside of AB and SK Canada has pretty close to decoupled our GDP from carbon emissions outside of agriculture. If we globally want to reduce carbon as quickly and cheaply as possible, contemplating what China is doing as Canadians is a bit of a fool's game. We can do it here quickly and easily. We have no control over what they are doing. To your analogy, it'd be like complaining about those 40 punches that will land regardless while ignoring the other two would not land with a simple ""please don't"" because ""what's the point""."

We can expand our grid with renewables (and/or nuclear though the lag time on reactors becoming operational makes them a worse choice now—but how I wish they weren’t lumped in with the bomb during the 60s and 70s and were used to a greater degree). As it is the only state in America where the grid is more carbon intensive than the fleet is WV (and even those data are several years old—during a time when coal has been decommissioned rather rapidly). In Canada, the electric vehicles, especially doubling as storage capacity for the grid would be far better than the current gasoline/diesel fleet. As it is, Canada does emit a lot of carbon due to heating. That can change with new technology—from heat pumps to electrification. These are technologies being embraced by the left and not by the right. If the right weren’t so allergic to progress on sustainability, I wouldn’t find their arguments so disingenuous."
