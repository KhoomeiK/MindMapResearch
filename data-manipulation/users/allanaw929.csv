pitbulls,ffem408,t1_ffejuq7,1579853946.0,"That's mine to a T, except mine doesn't even bother eating, just quick pee then back to bed! Summer is different, he'll lay down on the grass and sleep lol"
dogs,fed06kv,t1_fecwchi,1578992105.0,"Made me chuckle at that. Luckily the teething doesn't last as long as it does in humans (my 21 months old son is still teething, since he was 7 weeks old!) thank goodness. Just get him plenty large sized puppy chew toys and he'll work it out on those."
dogs,febdn2x,t1_fe7a1ig,1578957744.0,"It will come, one day he will be like a prince of dogs lol. It's good you're doing all the right things, I used to have Great Danes and Weimeraners so I know about the importance of  training young so that you don't have an unruly pony on your hands after a few months lol. Both of those breeds are clumsy and leggy when pups too, i always found it hilarious and endearing. I think you'll do great, good luck with him, and your other dog"
dogs,fe79031,t3_enx90b,1578911619.0,"They are beautiful dogs, I'm friendly with one and he's a sweetie, although he's not great with other dogs, but he was kept as a breeding dog and wasn't socialised until his current owner got him. Make sure you you socialise him well and you'll have an amazing dog, they're so majestic"

Staffies,fe6sl32,t3_eny670,1578903427.0,"My staffordshire bull terrier was the easiest dog in the world to train, as were the fosters I've had, whereas other breeds I've had have been a whole other ball game. A staffie (either) does generally play rough but a Frenchie is more than capable of coping with this (physically). I don't know much about the amstaff but young staffies do require a lot of exercise to not be boisterous or destructive but no more (probably less) than any high energy breed. I have lived in a tiny bungalow with a tiny garden with mine and he's the perfect house dog, although we do at least 2 hours walking per day.
They're the most loving breed, once you've had one you won't ever want another breed. (I've had Great Dane, Boxer, Weimeraner, crossbreed, and labrador)."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe6qspc,t3_enq8t2,1578901033.0,"My staffy makes these exact noises, especially when I come out of the shop, he'll ""shout at"" me until I gave him something I've bought for him to carry home. He also does it when I say I'm going out to smoke but then take a while faffing around, because we then throw his toy while I sit on the doorstep. I've realised he starts as soon as I pick up the cigarettes so I'm keeping them in my pocket where possible"
