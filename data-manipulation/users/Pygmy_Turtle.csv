scoliosis,fgnlgg5,t1_fgnctro,1580947385.0,"Half and half really, it was something I needed to get done, and I guess I'm glad my back is somewhat straighter and hopefully prevented from getting worse, but I also regret it as the side effects from it really get me down as it's such a change from before I had the surgery (no arm pain, numbness etc). From my experience, I hadn't heard of any side effects of the surgery from people in general until the doctors told me when I started making plans with doctors for the surgery to take place, which is a shame. Scoliosis isn't so much of uncommon thing, yet you don't really hear about the side effects from people unless you go looking for it. You just get the general 'oh, my niece got that done' rather than them letting you know of any issues they got because of it, which seem to be the standard post op. There doesn't seem to be much awareness in general of side effects you get from surgery, which is a shame as so many people have surgery done (any surgery) and it would be nice if people know better what they'll be getting into, especially if they've never had surgery before, as the difference post op might be quite upsetting for them. I remember being very upset a few days after surgery, when I was asked if I wanted to get changed, and felt I couldn't because I simply couldn't move that way anymore, and wondered if my movement would be so restricted permanently. So I'd just advise people make sure they're informed and to think things through carefully and listen to your doctors advice (rather than, say, push for surgery if it's not necessary).

Ideally I would've had VBT, since it seems like a much better option that preserves flexibility and likely feels less uncomfortable (possibly has less side effects) but I don't think it's an option in my country (england), and even if it was, my parents unfortunately didn't actively seek treatment/advice for my condition when I was at an age for that to be an option. If that could be an option in england, it would be great, as I hear great things about it, though I don't know if it would be offered on the NHS, or just private care (if private care, I would not be able to get it). It would be nice if my sister can get that done in the future, as she likely has scoliosis herself (undiagnosed as of yet) and I would want a treatment for her that is less problematic than mine was, as I feel that's possibly also scaring her off from seeing a doctor about it."
