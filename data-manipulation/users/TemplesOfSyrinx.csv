atheism,ffig4ql,t1_ffhij0e,1579973064.0,"Nevertheless, anything written in the bible isn't hate speech. That's just not what hate speech is. And even OP's suggestion that distribution of the bible being illegal is a stretch. It would take much more than that before it would be considered hate speech.

>As such it's a religious directive, not history or fiction.

I'd argue that the bible is all three. It's absolutely and most certainly historical and many books in the bible would easily fall under the category of fiction (or at least be considered as *fictional*)."
atheism,ffif9z9,t1_ffhkw5o,1579972477.0,"Right. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the bible, in and of itself and also by definition, isn't hate speech.  Someone sitting on a street corner with a megaphone inciting people to kill gay people based on some verse in the bible (or any other book) *is*. I think the distinction is important."
BlueOysterCult,ffiesfx,t1_ffhmxcg,1579972147.0,"Well, take the Beatles, for example. I think they are a fantastic band. Maybe one of the top 5 (or higher) rock/pop bands of all time. I think they deserve to be in the RRHF. I'm being objective when I say that because I rarely listen to them. As favourite bands go, I don't know if they'd crack my top 100. 

BOC is kind of the opposite, for me. I listen to them a lot and they're a favourite rock band. But I'm on the fence about them being in the RRHF - I *get it* if they don't resonate with most people. There are also a lot of bands, people in the RRHF that I don't think should be there. Generally speaking, I think the RRHF should be more limiting."
atheism,ffhhaka,t1_ffhgk0k,1579935203.0,"But...it's basically a bylaw from a 3000 year old tribe. I don't see how a passage like that would constitute hate speech any more (or less) than hundreds of thousands of old books. The Greeks and Persians had similarly brutal laws. Are all old manuscripts ""hate speech""?

Edit: Further, the verse doesn't mention ""gays"". No where in Leviticus is there any implication that two women in love should be killed. Not that Lev 20:13 is any less brutal but let's be clear about what the verse actually says.
To draw a parallel, Leviticus also has some strong words about shellfish but that doesn't mean it has a problem with eating food in general."
