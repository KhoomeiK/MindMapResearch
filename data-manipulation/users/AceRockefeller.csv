I then investigated a little bit and found out that he lied by saying he was still with his most recent company when in actuality he left 3 months ago for another job which he never mentioned.

I definitely would have still hired him if he just told the truth and said the fit wasn't right or it was toxic or a million other things. But lying straight to my face in the first interview was a huge dealbreaker."

>Heaven forbid he lose some money and become simply a multi millionaire.

Again... how do you not get this? That's not how any business in the world works. They don't just give away money if they don't need to. Why do you just expect someone/a business to reduce their entire net worth?

Secondly, they don't just have a billion in liquid cash... not even close. IF they sold off all their assets (including the team) they'd have a billion.

>It's be one thing to secure a government subsidised loan even. It's an entirely different thing to use tax payer money for the profit of a private entity which provides only marginal return when it could have been better spent on projects that better benefit the public at

Who the fuck do you think pays for government subsidized loans? Spoiler alert... tax payers..

You're dumb as shit if you just assume I'm 100% in support of public funding of stadiums. Governments/taxpayers absolutely should not be footing the bill. But guess what? That's competition. SOME city WILL be willing to pay.

However, I love that you had to look at my post history to justify your fallacious argument. ;)"
bengals,fe038ae,t1_fdztrm1,1578801954.0,"Sure, they could leverage their holdings for private funding. That's not how the world works though. Nobody is going to sell a large majority of their business to privately fund a new stadium if they don't have to. 

Business owners don't just give away most of their wealth and power to fund projects that others will. Right or wrong that's not how it works."
bengals,fdzlq5x,t1_fdpwjto,1578791418.0,"Eh, their entire net worth is about a billion dollars. And the large majority of that is tied up in the Bengals ownership. There's no way the family would be able to pay for a new stadium out of pocket. Back in 2008 Lucas Oil Stadium cost $720 million. They would need to sell most of their ownership shares to afford it."

nfl,fcp3wgk,t1_fcp2zx8,1577849681.0,"Technically, sure. The fanbase and I are SUPER greatful with what Lewis was able to do while he was here.We went from the 90's to at least have winning records and playoff appearences. All of that was far more than what we had in the 90's.

But Lewis took us as far as he could. He couldn't get us to the next level. He didn't have/lost his  passion. It was clear. He doesn't even watch the NFL anymore. He also said he didn't even watch the playoffs if the Bengals weren't playing in them (when he was coach).

The team obviosuly gave up on him late in seasons when the season was lost. It was especially clear last year. This year I saw no hint of players giving up. And we went 2-14..

When we won games, he gave a speech (as all coaches do) but his speeches were uninspiring. When we lost games he basically had the same tone and seemed like he was OK with just being OK.

Having a winning record is good. We're not here for just a winning record. We're here to win a Superbowl.

His loyalty to people like Pacman, Bob Bratkowski, Marvin Lewis etc. is blind loyalty."
nfl,fcorwvy,t1_fcoi9o8,1577839906.0,Being loyal and winning aren't mutually exclusive. Marvin Lewis being the HC for 16 years while it's clear Marvin didn't care about football anymore showed he cared about loyalty far more than winning. Mike Brown's MO over and over was/is to always choose loyalty to those close to him rather than win or be loyal to the fans paying him.
bengals,fcogvca,t1_fclxkog,1577831921.0,I disagree. I think the Bengals absolutely pick for need. Especially since they don't do anything in free agency. They almost have to pick for need.
bengals,fcogqla,t1_fcm1r2s,1577831830.0,I think if anyone trades for Dalton they do it after the draft if they miss on their QB. I would think most teams would prefer to scout QB's and see if they can grab one.
