datingoverthirty,ffs4scx,t3_eut684,1580173129.0,I’m a 33m and simply refuse to talk negatively about my ex or anyone I’ve even dated a little. It seems so silly to do that and kinda shows the headspace someone is truly in. I was married for 7 years and I filed the divorce. I loved her and she’s a great soul. A few months of poor decisions does not define her and not resenting her was the healthy place I needed to be in. You won’t catch me dead talk g poorly of her and I hope she goes on to kick ass at life.

DeadBedrooms,ffg9fb2,t1_ffg9d2g,1579901311.0,Ahh. Yeah that could work for some people. Not something I’d be cool with.
DeadBedrooms,ffg8ysd,t1_ffg8w9c,1579901029.0,I’m confused at what your suggesting lol
DeadBedrooms,ffg8oyx,t1_ffg8fwj,1579900861.0,"She did not to my knowledge. I never pressed for any thing like that but she was quite open about her life, herself and her feelings. She does have polycystic ovary syndrome as well."
DeadBedrooms,fffopl4,t1_fffoiaf,1579888494.0,To be fair. She was honest about it fairly early on. A testosterone / estrogen imbalance type thing. So really that was awesome she was open about it. We still had intimacy early on although looking back I wonder the sincerity of it. It really eats at her as well. She’s fully aware of her lack of intimacy and desire. Which honestly makes all this that much more difficult in some ways .

movies,ff50exe,t1_ff50c0c,1579576887.0,Like when they came into brunch his daughters hair were still wet as if they’d just showered maybe. I mean he was wearing gym shorts and a t shirt. Looked as if they’d just left they’re hotel/air b n b or what ever rich famous people stay in when they’re doing movies lol
movies,ff4t7bg,t1_ff436uf,1579571865.0,I had a fun interaction with him and his daughters at a shared brunch table in Savannah Ga. Some dude and his two daughters sat down next to my wife and I and we didn’t pay much attention.  He had sat his wallet on the table awkwardly close to my plate. Anyways- a few minutes go by and he laughed at something and I shit you not my whole childhood just flashed before my eyes- like I fucking knew that laugh in my soul. Obviously it ended up being Adam Sandler. Both of his daughters hair was wet so they must have been staying close (they were filming The Do Over apparently). My wife had some small talk with his daughters about hair and it was just kinda surreal. At some point during brunch I jokingly told him something like “although I appreciate the gesture you don’t have to buy our food” and pointed at his wallet basically touching my plate. He literally did end up buying our brunch that day. It was pretty neat. We got a picture with him (which we never ever do if we run into someone famous) and that was that. Super cool experience having grown up watching him as a kiddo.

NoStupidQuestions,feovp8k,t1_feovdww,1579306425.0,Sure. I’m just simplifying the question. Is there a loophole that someone could commit a heinous crime but the powers to be just openly say “the money you’re offering is more helpful to our government than the crime you want to commit- so go for it”
NoStupidQuestions,feovlls,t1_feovfpr,1579306362.0,I’m fully aware. Just trying to simply the question. Could a judge just be like “what you want to do is wrong but that money would be more helpful than the crime - so sure go for it”

AustralianShepherd,feo19i8,t1_fen9mjo,1579293709.0,Get an industrial size dry mop that you can remove and wash. Avoid putting rugs down. I can hit my whole house in about 3 minutes with that thing lol
AskHR,fenmg0t,t1_femwevk,1579287822.0,I’m in no way trying to pass judgement -  my apologies.
AskHR,femedwy,t3_epw0bc,1579251156.0,I’d assume someone buying a $300+ dollar sweater would have a fairly good grasp of appropriate situational attire lol
PublicFreakout,felqhzn,t1_fekbnu9,1579228471.0,"Yeah. It’s a freeze frame from a video. She does this grin, chomp air, cheesy grin , show teeth and spin head thing that is nearly impossible to catch a picture of lol"
PublicFreakout,fejihie,t1_fejifrq,1579175717.0,"Literally never seen her pissed, angry or upset. So I’ve not clue. In my recent post history there’s a video I posted that I took this still frame from if you’re curious enough to get an idea of her goofy grin in excitement or confusion lol"
houseplants,fejf3l2,t1_fejf2qk,1579171097.0,It’s just a joke honestly. I was cleaning today and must have moved the camera lol

savannah,feis4uh,t1_feis1ux,1579145812.0,Nah. It’s fun. Just don’t be fuckin in front of folks my dude. If ya wanna get your nudity rocks off drive down to Haulover Beach in north Miami. It’s clothing optional.

AskHR,feieczc,t3_epbaus,1579136543.0,Just ask in the interview process. I’ve learned that in general any company who isn’t cool with discussing a salary during an interview is a company I don’t wanna work for. We ain’t there for passion and kitten snuggles.

television,feg2lcu,t1_fee73sw,1579074179.0,Noticed the skin on the neighbor looked a bit older no? Perhaps it’s his mom?
fuckthesepeople,fefryl0,t1_fefphbo,1579063439.0,You only hear the horror stories. I’ve got two neighbors with the shittiest fucking yards on planet earth. Honestly- I don’t personally care but it’s super annoying to have friends over and be in the back yard only to have to stare at what is essentially two dumpster piles of back yards. Good HOA’s can be beneficial if the people running them aren’t out of touch greedy fucktards

AskVet,fe8woz8,t3_eo432t,1578931914.0,You don’t have any plants do ya? My Aussie somehow got into my dumb cane and luckily I caught her immediately. I took her to the vet anyways and the vet informed me the myriad of possible effects. Blistering and ulcers in the mouth and throat were one of em... amongst many other things. Just a thought.

AmItheAsshole,fdypmn6,t1_fdypg0w,1578782291.0,I was just asking my mom about it a few minutes ago. She also said that I kept claiming it was not a knife and that it was a stick. I guess four year old me was determined to not get in trouble. Lol
AmItheAsshole,fdyiw56,t1_fdyirpx,1578780241.0,Ty. Noted for the future - at which time I’ll most likely forget and fuck it up again. Lol -
AmItheAsshole,fdy5vka,t1_fdy5dla,1578776447.0,Oh jeeeez. My story gets worse. I wasn’t allowed to play with knives but my older had a small pocket knife. So I grabbed a kitchen knife to go play with him and his friends. Tripped running up a levee and lodged that thing into my intestines. Worse part... my older brothers friend carried me back home and I hid in the closet out of fear of getting in trouble. My poor mom found me passed out in the closet with blood everywhere. My appendix had burst and belly was bloated/swelling. Idk. Poor mom. Pretty much set my childhood in motion. I was one of those kids that always had a cast or stitches.

AmItheAsshole,fdw4c3v,t3_en622s,1578754879.0,"When I was 4 I was running with a knife and basically gutted myself. After a several weeks in the hospital, a month and a half with a colostomy bag and a few more follow ups I was finally allowed to try and start pooping normally again. Queue my dumb fuck uncle who jokingly told me there were snakes in the toilets and to be careful or they’d bite me. It literally terrified me. I could barely even go into a bathroom- sitting on a toilet wasn’t even an option. I spent the next year or more holding in poops, hiding in pain because I’d pooped my pants a little and didn’t want my family to find out. It ended up causing some major constipation and complications post surgery. Like legit fucked with me for years. I’m not saying this is as serious but wtf people- telling dumb “joking lies” to children can really complicate their growing and evolving brains."
corgi,fds9vnt,t1_fdrafe1,1578697703.0,I watched my dads dog get mauled and killed by a raccoon when I was a kiddo. Devastating. This was a 70lb dog too.
AskVet,fdr7i14,t1_fdr7f0n,1578680604.0,Ok. Thank you for the insight. I’ll delete this post . I appreciate your feedback!
AskVet,fdr78y2,t1_fdr64kk,1578680474.0,Yeah I know. She is still with the breeder. The breeder wants to keep her u til at least 10 weeks as she’s a bit smaller than the rest of the litter. I’m certainly just being a bit overzealous I guess. I am fully planning on having the breeder get her checked. Possibly just looking for insight on if anyone thinks her head is unusually domed. To me it doesn’t appear to be but I’m also no expert.
corgi,fdqbmkt,t1_fdqbam8,1578662200.0,My last one was a spicy little bastard too! I miss her more than anything. More personality than most people lol
