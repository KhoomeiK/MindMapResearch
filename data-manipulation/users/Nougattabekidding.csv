The thing that stood out to me is how disparate Arthur and Piper are. Arthur is a classic, traditional English name and Piper is a modern American name. Now, that doesn’t mean you can’t use either/both of them, of course not, but I do think they clash a bit. I’m not one for themed sibling sets but I do like sib sets to sound cohesive, if that makes sense? So perhaps if you want more children and you might end up with a boy called Arthur (great name btw - only reason it’s not on our final shortlist is because it’s very popular here in the U.K.) then Philippa/Pippa might fit better?

I’m unconvinced by Mars as a nickname for Martin, it’s not very intuitive. I don’t think Marty is inevitable though - I know a few Martins and only one of them is a Marty."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fedq8z3,t1_fecp0hp,1579017539.0,It’s honestly not that bad. My advice is to use a designated poo knife to just scrape straight into the loo.

Of course, he’d probably give you an odd look considering the fact he wasn’t building a defensive structure. This is a folly, it’s not a real castle, it’s just supposed to look pretty and impressive."

pics,fedn7ye,t1_fed91fe,1579015622.0,I doubt it. I’ve not read anything that suggests there was a religious angle to the building of the folly.

Cooking,fecwqhg,t1_fe8hux3,1578987682.0,"Well, my SO will get sick/die if he eats too many bananas without injecting insulin just the same as he would if he ate too many chocolate bars without injecting insulin. 

Now, I’m being somewhat flippant, but my point is natural sugars are still sugars. I would argue that diabetes is a health problem associated with both types of sugar (and carbs in general). 

They’re definitely a much healthier option than refined sugars for sure, but they still shouldn’t be eaten in excess. It is however a lot harder to eat an excess amount of natural sugars than an excess of refined sugars. 

Also it depends how you are consuming the fruit. A glass of orange juice is not as healthy as eating an orange for example, and the trend for using dates to flavour oat bars, energy balls etc does rather ignore the fact that dates are super sugary."

But of course I totally get you were just trying to help out.  Yeah, I added some suggestions for OP in the thread but I think she’s read most of them!

I think you and I have slightly diverging tastes because whilst I like the SA, I’m not a fan of Kingkiller etc. That said, I can’t recommend The Daevabad trilogy enough. Or give the lies of Locke Lamora a spin, that might be up your street."
Fantasy,feb2psr,t1_feb0j3z,1578954925.0,"I know what you mean, there’s a lot of fantasy based around battles and wars, but OP specifically asked for recommendations that *don’t* have that focus."
Fantasy,feb1y4p,t3_env2lc,1578954708.0,"Have you read the Priory of the Orange Tree? I’m not big into battles etc and didn’t find it too action-driven.

Seconding the Winternight suggestion. There’s also The Snow Child which was a nice standalone read and kinda similar in vibe. 

The Daevabad Trilogy (only 2 out so far) does have action but also quite a lot of political machinations. One of the best series I read so far and I think we have quite similar tastes (Circe, Golen and the Djinni, night circus etc) so I think you’d like it!"
Fantasy,feb09m4,t1_fe5n47u,1578954129.0,"I don’t think this fits the criteria. It’s heavily focused on war and battles, plus there’s quite a lot of grimdark elements."
