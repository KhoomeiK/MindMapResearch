europes,ff5phhs,t1_ff5fd3u,1579604745.0,"I agree that a State is not accountable for the crimes its citizens do, but I definitively think it should be responsible for its citizens abroad, as they often are when their citizens get convicted by another State, like the detained [American preacher in Turkey](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/08/02/an-american-preacher-detained-in-turkey-is-not-the-only-hostage), the [British journalist in China](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/3032850/political-hostage-british-journalist-detained-china-27-months-reprisal), the [Chinese Huawei employee detained in Canada](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-china-idUSKBN1Y31Z7) and many more... How can it be that a State only cares for its ""good"" or ""useful"" citizens, but anyone considered, so to say, ""lumpen"" is left to their own devices?

And I just don't buy the State security argument. Even if the judicial system fails to arrest (or similar) dangerous citizens, many States have intelligence agencies well capable of spying their citizens provided they have a court order. And if that's not possible, well, maybe they should think about stepping up their game.

But anyways, that's adults. I think the [Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 20](https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/convention-text) makes it pretty clear whose responsibility it is to make sure a child is provided a secure environment if their parents aren't capable of doing so..."
europes,ff3w5rh,t1_ff3riz3,1579550163.0,"I personally find it tremendously irresponsible of European countries to just leave these people in the Levant. A nation is supposed to be responsible for its citizens and if they commit crimes such as joining terrorist organizations, they should be tried for it. Given the actual situation in Syria and Iraq, Europe should take that responsibility. In my view, we're letting others have to deal with our problem.

Especially kids should be brought back ASAP, there no valid reason to leave them there, as long as the parents permit it. I heard an interview of the grandfather of some [Swedish-Chilean kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/be3ztx/help_7_orphaned_children_and_a_desperate/) where he talked about the struggle he had to go through in order to repatriate his grandchildren.

victoria2,fctz41u,t3_eivj71,1577966627.0,"Conservatives, Liberals and Socialists don't always have the same policies in all countries, you should especially look at what they will end up applying as ruling party. The three things I care the most about are trade, economic and war policy.

Trade Policy is very important at the beginning, when tariff efficiency is still low and 100% tariffs are vital to sustain the economy, so I aim at Protectionism.

Similarily, Economic Policies influence taxation and at the beginning tax efficiency is bad, so Laissez Faire is horrible for you economy. When you start to build your industry, having State Capitalism (or Planned Economy if available) is huge plus, since it allows you to manually decide which factories to build where. Planned Economy requires a lot of micromanagment and capitalists become useless and will demote, so there's that. Also, if you're not industrializing already, Intervensionism and Laisez Faire allow foreigners to build railways in your country, so keep that in mind!

For War Policy, unless you're doing a pacifist run or something Jingoism is godlike. It gives huge bonuses to your war effort with almost no downside. In case you can't get it, Pro-Military is obviously the next-best.

So in general, at the beginning this means appointing Reactionaries. In democracies you'll probably have to satisfy yourself with Conservatives. Going to mid-game, Socialists are good for their reform desire. Late game Fascists or Communists provide good policies."
Switzerland,fctsyf3,t1_fctps51,1577957883.0,"> Private organisations are not part of the system. They could disappear  tomorrow. If you count on Caritas etc., it's really not that far from a  Facebook-Group. It's a pitty that private organisations, funded by  donations, have to fulfill tasks that actually belong to the government.

But you're very wrong here, the Swiss system is based on private organisations in every aspect of society. That's an integral part of how the country and culture work and I can't think of any nation that doesn't work like this to some degree. In fact, Caritas for example works in close relationship with cantonal institutions.

>Second, there is a difference between get free help from an organisation  and afford things. I won't get that free help until I can't afford the  food. 

That's not entirely true, as you don't have to be moneyless to get help, you have to be below a certain threshold. But apart from that, what's even your point here? Obviously these organisations focus on the people who actually need the help, the rest can go buy their stuff like everybody else.

&#x200B;

>I know, in theory,  there is no one in Switzerland who is supposed to be  hungry or homeless. Unfortunately, practice looks different. I can only  always repeat: Do you think people lie on the street in winter because  it's funny? And don't you think, going to Caritas or similar would  require less ""swallowing pride"" than ask on Facebook where everybody who  knows can see it and than talk to 20min? There are reasons why it still  happens with 1000s of people and the most frequent reason is that the  systems fails sometimes like in every other country.

Yeah, of course practice looks different, because life can often be a convoluted mess and it's hard to plan accordingly. The example you show is a woman suffering from home violence that could ""easily"" have gone to a [woman's refuge](https://frauenhaus-schweiz.ch/), but often it is hard to take such a decision. Coming from a family that suffered from home violence I know from experience that the problem often doesn't reside in a lack of available help, but the reluctance to take legal action or abandon your home.

&#x200B;

>I don't know why it's so difficult for Swiss to accept that they face the same problems as more or less every other country.  

I'm well aware of the problems that Switzerland faces, just like every country, and I definitively don't agree with how certain things are handled here and hope it keeps improving. But, it's been the collective effort of generations of a lot of good people to get where we are and all that good work has to be recognized and be grateful for.

It's good that you're aware and critical of how things work and that you wish them to improve, but I'll say it again: There's virtually no one who can't afford to eat or a place to live here, because a minimum standard of living is provided for here."

> That's what I said with ""temporary no income"" But ""most of the time"" remains ""most of the time"" 

Yeah, I just noticed that my comment repeated a lot from yours, thanks for the correction. But what I was trying to say is that there's virtually no one who can't afford food or an apartment and that is something that should be celebrated.

Again, I'm not saying there's no poverty or homelessness, but the state/organizations will provide for basic needs if you care to get them. Unfortunately that's not the case in much of the world."
Switzerland,fcra19r,t1_fcr3n5g,1577898951.0,"Poverty exists, but access to food is not really a problem here. There are enough organisations and state institutions caring for that, as your example shows. Most of the time people experience such situations because of a lack of cash while being in the process of getting help (which unfortunately can sometimes take a while) or because must still overcome their shame (which is in itself quite a problem in Swiss society), not because they wouldn't be able to get the money mid-term."

victoria2,fcmr8q7,t3_ehvovw,1577788271.0,"Depending on you exact intentions, some suggestions would:

USA for little involvement in European affairs, new world immigration, democracy.

Sweden for high literacy, HM's gov, Corporative Industrialism tech school and secondary power. Switzerland is similar but with democracy.

Russia for absolute monarchy, low literacy and tech LOTS of states to build factories on. 

France and Austria (Austria-Hungary) for a relatively established nation (both have conflicting states, though, Alsace-Lorraine and Venice).

UK for a good start in industry right at the beginning and a secure place in Europe.

Edit: btw, some nations can avoid a whole lot of problems if you give up on certain claims (like France and Austria). Also, if you don't care too much for prestige, you should be able to ignore most crises."
