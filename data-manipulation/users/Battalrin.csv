Perhaps having someone you do fully trust take you in and fully protect you it gives you the opportunity to let your guard down and relax in a way you were never able to before. When he says 'sshh' what you are hearing is ""you don't need to feel scared anymore, I won't let anything hurt you or threaten you, I will protect you"""
offmychest,fcls7v9,t1_fclrjfp,1577755189.0,thanks thats very sweet of you :)
offmychest,fclrdxx,t1_fclqymb,1577754623.0,thats a lovely philosophy :) I will try to take it in myself
offmychest,fclqibs,t1_fclq9i6,1577754012.0,"people say that and honestly thats what i find attractive in people too, i love weird, interesting people who stand out in a crowd but...idk...i think there is a limit on it and i fear I have passed that limit. People often tell me how cool/interesting they think I am or how they respect me and the things I care about but its always very platonic."

We all have different fetishes and kinks, cuckolding fetishes (which is what this is called) are more common than you would think. You do not have to be ashamed of what turns you on, sit down with your partner, tell them about these feelings you are having and see if she would be willing to help you explore this fetish of yours :) Communication is the key"
