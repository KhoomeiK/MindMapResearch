Maybe you were being satirical in response to other posters who were sincerely judging her? in which case, you could add an eye roll or lol or something.

Your comment comes off as joking, but still judging her, which is why you got the reception that apparently has upset you.  No need to insult everybody because your joke was tone-deaf!"

nextfuckinglevel,ff4px9s,t1_ff3sqzo,1579569606.0,"I guess I consider a standardized, timed, mass-graded examination like this ""an awful way to learn art.""  I shouldn't have said *exactly* their point - but I figured they knew it was a test, and were suggesting that the mere existence of an examination like this was what was so strikingly different from their own experience.  That the fact that it was a test *added* to that contrast.

Obviously I don't think they should be getting help in an exam.  I'm saying the whole situation is anathema to the idea of ""art.""  (I've since read that this may be an entrance exam, and I can see how this might be a reasonable way to test technical skills while ensuring applicants can't cheat by submitting somebody else's work.  Still crazy though.)"

I see someone drop a butt almost daily - on the highway it's easy to see as it lights up hitting the ground.  A couple of days ago, I was at a drive-through window and some asshole dropped his half cigarette near my car before going into the restaurant.  It burned there for minutes wafting into my open window.  

I could die happy if I saw a cop ticket someone for this - I mean it's littering, poison, and fire hazard all in one.  And how hard is it to figure out how to properly dispose of them?  It's not like they didn't know they'd have a cigarette today.  I don't get it, kind of like gum on the sidewalk.  WTF is wrong with people?"
atheism,fetr9pe,t1_fetc0p2,1579378781.0,"I think many Dr.'s have cognitive dissonance because they may know better, but they've performed it themselves, or done it to their kids, or recommended it for decades, (starting when 95% of certain communities did it).  Sadly, for some, it's also a source of income.  I told my son's pediatrician we weren't doing it, and he said, ""good, because there's nobody around here who knows what they're doing!"" which is terrifying esp. since it was in an excellent suburban hospital.  

I also had to take my son to a pediatric urologist for a kidney issue, and not that he's had any complications at all, they pre-emptively implied circumcision may be necessary later if he has infections or issues... On one hand, yes, they're probably more qualified than anyone else to perform it, but it's also scary because docs tend to suggest solutions in the field their trained in."

If you go along with this even for a month, demand an itemized invoice/receipt.  Send it to insurance and report it to the medical/ethics board (state, local, idk exactly who).  Even if it's somehow legal, I bet they don't want to be investigated or audited.  They deserve whatever they get for extorting you like this.  Hell, if you can find out your state's law on recording people, get it on tape, lol.  Or if that requires consent or you're not sure, ask permission to record their explanation ""for clarity."""

But it's probably more like an aversion to being alone with my thoughts.  I didn't realize it was such a common ADHD thing until I got diagnosed and came here.  

I'm guessing the people responding with the general advice about sleep don't really get it.  I've heard different advice that I'm sure could work, but I never brought myself to try them, and don't really remember them... The best thing that works for me is getting into a book that I really enjoy reading.  Then I can get myself to bed to read.  Even though it's tempting to keep starting new chapters, eventually the drowsiness wins.

I'll be interested in reading if anyone truly has any good strategies - I feel like getting to bed at 10 every night could make a world of difference."
