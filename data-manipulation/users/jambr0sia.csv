gainit,ferc7vz,t3_eqewjy,1579352298.0,"If you can spare the extra calories without getting fat, there’s nothing wrong with sweets. Think of nutrition from the perspective of inclusion - it matters what foods and nutrients you include in your diet, not what you exclude. 

There’s nothing inherently damaging about sweets. They can be hard on your health in the long term if certain conditions are true, though. 

My honest recommendation is to focus on eating real, nutrient dense foods. I doubt you’ll even want sweets if you can learn how to cook delicious whole food meals."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fep5u9c,t1_fennexz,1579312797.0,"It’s text based communication. That, paired with the all-too-common hostility and tribalism that reigns supreme here, I totally understand why you were thinking that way."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fenmzky,t1_fenlu4h,1579288067.0,"This seems to fundamentally be a problem with the poverty of text-based communications. We’re arguing over connotative semantics right now. 

I appreciate your argument, and just for fun, I’ll answer your point. Let’s say I said “people on Reddit are mean.” If I did say that, it would be a somewhat sloppy generalization (like my original comment that we’ve been arguing about), but it wouldn’t be the same thing as saying “people on reddit are always mean and never nice.” 

Regardless, all I can do at this point and apologize for the miscommunication and reassure you that I do believe that people can act with true good will towards others. 

I hope you have a nice day :)"
getdisciplined,fenmc1g,t1_fengo78,1579287754.0,"Yeah! So the research that I’m referring to actually used mindfulness practice. The first major studies were on nicotine addiction. 

Researchers taught people how to pay attention to their experience, and advised them to meditate as they smoked cigarettes, literally paying attention to the feeling of the smoke going into their lungs, the taste, etc. 

In order for this to work, you do have to establish a baseline meta-cognitive transparency or ability to pay attention to your immediate experience. 

You could start by mediating only 10 minutes per day. Within a week, I could almost guarantee that you wouldn’t be so lost in the riptides of your subconscious influences, and you’d be able to at least stop and evaluate before wasting another hour somewhat more often. 

I can send you some links for resources (free “intro to mindfulness courses”/trials) if you DM me! And finally- know that you’re not alone here. Lots of people struggle with this, and have turned it around. It’s 100% possible to rewire your habits."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fenl7y6,t1_fenjp5p,1579287072.0,"No, you’re not quite getting it right. I didn’t add any qualifiers. 

If I said “it rains,” is that the same thing as saying that rain is the only thing that ever happens? 

You’re turning a non-absolute statement into an absolute one, and I have no idea why. You can’t say that I was claiming that all compassion ever exercised is a facade. It’s just a non sequitur. Nothing else to say here."

getdisciplined,fen6quj,t3_epzxm2,1579278197.0,"One piece of advice would be to really meditate on how NOT rewarding those avoidance activities are. The circuits that make you do them are more automatic than they are conscious choices, and your brain makes that decision because it thinks that snacking/checking reddit/etc is more rewarding than completing your work. 

&#x200B;

The good news is that you can UPDATE your reward system. [You even have a brain structure dedicated to doing this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739757/), called the orbitofrontal cortex.  Research shows that you can stimulate update activity simply by paying attention to what you're doing. How fun is it, actually, to eat more sweets? How fun is it, actually, to complete that serious task that's been on your to-do list?

&#x200B;

Think about that and practice it, and the automatic wiring will re-write itself :)"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fekmrea,t1_fekfsa5,1579203286.0,What is it about my original comment that made you think I was saying that it’s always the case?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fekbdv9,t1_fek5ksr,1579196513.0,"I didn’t say that “everyone” does this, or that it’s always the case. I have too many positive relationships with other people to ever be under that illusion. 

My point is that compassion can be used as a rhetoric device at times, by people who are either incompetent (unable to help others) or even malicious. 

Thanks for the straw man, though. I’ll name him Steven."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fejuhjg,t1_feiyzv8,1579186135.0,"Definitely not a trump supporter, so don’t think I’m coming from that camp... but I will say that people claim that they’re being compassionate, but it’s a facade in order to grab power. Extreme example: Bolshevik Revolution."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feju8u4,t1_feit44b,1579185975.0,"The only issue with this is that it doesn’t work with a corrupt government. We spend loads of money on things that never quite come to fruition, in terms of benefitting the people.

onguardforthee,fe400mw,t1_fe3pn6e,1578854502.0,Agreed.

onguardforthee,fe2zq9f,t1_fe2wxzv,1578844553.0,"Did his actions directly lead to this outcome, though? Or were there other agents involved? 

The only thing that directly lead to the deaths of the passengers was the launch of the missile. 

My point about the Big Bang is that you can’t arbitrarily follow lines of causality back and blame whoever you like the least in that chain. 

When something goes wrong, you should blame the ones who did wrong. And in this case, Trump had a stake in the wrongdoing. No surprise there. But the locus of responsibility is at the “fire” button."
onguardforthee,fe2xb7q,t1_fe2qhe1,1578843913.0,"I agree with completely. To the extent that Trump raised the probability of a tragedy like hundreds of innocents being gunned down, he SHOULD be held responsible. I’m with you there. 

My only gripe with some of the dialogue here is that people directly attribute what happened to trump, saying he “caused” this, as much or more than the Iranian military. But they are two separate agents, and if you’re going to distribute blame among the two, I certainly wouldn’t call it even."
onguardforthee,fe2v0uq,t1_fe2qja1,1578843144.0,"If it’s a game of probabilities, then you could say they contributed to the likelihood of it happening.  But to say they caused it just as much as the Iranian military is morally irresponsible, in my opinion. 

Keep in mind that I’m not justifying US military action. I don’t have a clue about the general who was killed, whether it was a good call, etc. Neither of us have access to the information we’d need to make that evaluation. 

All I’m saying is that we’d be screwing with our moral integrity if we thought the US “caused” this to the same degree that the Iranian military “caused” this. You could fault the Big Bang itself for “causing” all of this if you want to, but that wouldn’t be too useful, if you get my drift."
onguardforthee,fe2f05s,t1_fdzs87p,1578837669.0,"Trump’s an idiot, but he didn’t shoot the missile. That was Iran’s military. Who really deserves the blame here? Sure, the US prodded Iran.... but if I called you fat, or even threw a rock at you, and you proceeded to go on a knife murdering spree, would I have the victims’ blood on my hands? 


I’m saying this because we have to be honest and fair about who’s at fault for what. The trump administration does a lot wrong. But blaming them for blasting a commercial plane out of the sky is far from the truth, and we’ll pay for being disconnected with the truth.

Edit: threw, not three."
onguardforthee,fe2e4gk,t1_fe01k70,1578837337.0,"What happened with the plane has nothing to do with Canada’s proximity to the US. It could have been people of any nationality in that plane. 

Plus, though Trump is a total idiot, he wasn’t responsible for the plane going down. Iran’s military was stupid enough to SAM a commercial flight."

You can probably imagine that there’s certain brain activity that would be characteristic of certain birds of prey like eagles, too. In that sense, Sagan’s argument is very “speciesist” at bottom.
