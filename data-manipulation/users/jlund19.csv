dogs,ffe5c30,t1_ffe0ohv,1579837104.0,I saw that you're looking to train in MN. That's where I live and I train with a great group of people. Some are only R+ some are more balanced (but use corrections fairly. You can PM me for more info!
dogs,ffdaiy8,t1_ffd4fv1,1579816676.0,"I lied. I also have a prong collar on during bitework, too. But it's for the same exact reason you use yours."
dogs,ffd4d8w,t1_ffcumfb,1579813182.0,"The more I'm getting into the working dog world, the more I'm leaning away from the ""easy"" dogs. I had a hard time putting into words why that was, but you summed it up perfectly. I work with pet dogs day in and day out. For the first week they're with me, I'm trying to figure out what motivates them. I have *no* issue motivating my GSD. Zero. Hell, even if I don't have a toy or food, I can just tell her to bark for her reward. She is *always* motivated.

I honestly think Norma is a super easy dog. Very dog and human social while not seeking out attention, motivated, super stable, etc. But she is a high drive dog. Since I am a professional dog trainer and work at a facility that allows me to bring my dogs, I have no issues meeting her needs. I find meeting her needs to be easier than finding out what motivates an ""easy"" breed."
dogs,ffd3832,t3_esy7dw,1579812540.0,"I train in mondioring with my working line GSD. it's a different sport than IGP (Schutzhund) but it's still a protection sport. You are absolutely right. It's a dog *sport*. Both you and your dog should enjoy it. I have seen dogs turn into screaming monsters because of too much e-collar use. But that doesn't mean they can't be used safely and successfully. I personally use a prong collar very sparingly and usually just for obedience. If your dog has the genetics behind it, you shouldn't need those tools to get it to bite.

Protection sports are a big time commitment. It's best to find a club with members you groove with. I would personally stay way from this club. Just from what I understand about their corrections, they probably aren't building the dogs up correctly for bitework, either. Find a club with an experienced decoy/helper and a club who is accepting of your training methods and doesn't resort to compulsion straight away. There are bite sport clubs that are purely positive and they are successful. So it definitely can be done."
dogs,ff9iby6,t3_es3qod,1579713633.0,"Every day. It may not be evenly split every day, but they both get individual attention. With my GSD it's usually spent doing some training stuff. Or maybe we'll just play tug. With my poodle I usually do some trick training, but the majority of our time is spent cuddling"

I love when photographer friends come to bitework training! Lots of really cool pictures!"
k9sports,ff9fg3e,t3_eqkt8l,1579711873.0,"IGP/IPO/Schutzhund is alllll about precision and attitude. You focus on a lot of little details for a really long time. All trials will look the same no matter where they are held.

Mondioring is more about creating a critical thinker out of your dog. While the exercises are the same, everything is different between trials (like the retrieval item or the theme of the decor on the field). It's focused less on precision and more on if your dog really *knows* the exercise. A *lot* of time is spent proofing."
k9sports,ff9f1qn,t3_ericnx,1579711624.0,I know some people that train with latex gloves! That might help?
travel,ff6ch2h,t3_erlc9k,1579624183.0,"If you go, definitely wear water shoes. It's quite a walk to the cool cave waterfall and the path will destroy your feet of you walk it barefoot. Ask me how I know that...."
k9sports,ff3g5hd,t3_erd89i,1579540363.0,"Norma finally bit again yesterday! I'm so happy!

She was tugging really well with people last week (without the stick) so I just wanted her to play tug with the decoy and maybe intro some stick if she was doing well. Norm had a different idea. She didn't want the tug and kept looking for his legs so we put her back on sleeves again. She was super into it, even with stick work! I'm pretty relieved because her response to everything for the last month was pretty dramatic. I'm still playing around with the idea of trialing in March. Either way, I think I'm going to make the trip down there to train and support my other club members who are trialing.

OB looked good, as always. I'm trying to fade the reward in my hand and keep her fancy feet while heeling. She sticks with me just fine, but it doesn't look pretty. I think that will be our next big goal, other than bitework.

Oh, and the hurdle. She's weird about jumping when both pieces are on the jump. She jumps just fine if it's only one piece. But once you add the second one, she won't do it (even when it's at the same height)."

AskWomen,feswo7q,t3_eqepgd,1579369707.0,"I found my favorite people because of my dog. I train in a protection sport with her which requires being in a training club. There aren't a whole lot of clubs in my area so I joined one. And the rest is history. While our friendships were started around dogs, they have grown into some of the closest friendships I have"
GermanShepherd,feni7ue,t1_fengjjo,1579285242.0,Ahh gotcha. Feeding multiple large dogs gets very expensive very quickly.
GermanShepherd,fencslc,t1_femrnwc,1579281926.0,... $200 a month in food? What do you feed? Lobster?
dogs,feksm45,t1_fejw0tf,1579206750.0,"I've worked with a few rotties and it's been very interesting. The ones I have met have either been super scary and sketchy (like, it's gonna bite you for real scary) or super awesome dogs. Nothing in between."
dogs,fehiyz2,t3_ep2s7s,1579117503.0,"Brought my GSD to the vet yesterday for her yearly checkup and a rabies booster. She's super social so I wasn't worried about the visit. I was more worried that I was going to get some flack for not spaying her and choosing not to give some vaccines. Instead, my vet was super supportive of my decisions! It was pretty refreshing not having to give reasons why I haven't spayed her yet.

The vet said she thinks Norma is the perfect breed example for a GSD, both physically and temperamentally. It was a total proud mom moment.

Also, she weighs 67 pounds now! When on earth did my little puppy get so big? She was only 13.5 pounds when brought her home!"
SkincareAddiction,fehhej4,t1_fefwh3y,1579116583.0,"I used to have a super complex routine. My skin wasn't *awful* on it but it wasn't great either. I then cut it down to a face wash, BHA, and a moisturizer/sunscreen and my skin is *so* much better. I'm not using any new products. I just cut down to the essentials"
dogs,fefskue,t1_fefs8zy,1579063937.0,"You say I'm wrong with no proof. Breeding dogs responsibly and ethically is not the problem. Period. No, I do not have any vested interest in ""commercial"" breeding. But you're damn right if I support ethical breeders. There are purebred dogs for a reason, they serve a purpose, a job. Any reputable and ethical breeder is trying to better their breed. They are NOT contributing to the amount of dogs being euthanized. Period. Plain and simple."
dogs,feesaa1,t1_feenzvl,1579040134.0,"I have. I'm a professional dog trainer, I have volunteered at shelters, I have (tried) to fix dogs that have been messed up far beyond repair (and of no fault of their own), and have fostered.

I guess you can count reputable breeders as commercial breeding but any decent breeder will *not* allow one of their dogs to be put in a shelter. The buyer is usually contractually obligated to give the dog back to the breeder if they need to be surrendered for whatever reason. I know both of my dogs have a clause like that in their contracts. But, by and large, I would say it's the BYBs and the people who don't spay/neuter that contribute to the shelter population. I can't back that up with any real data, but that is my experience anyway."
dogs,feemyqw,t1_feem0me,1579037025.0,"I am not rejecting the data. It still seems high to me. That doesn't mean I think it's wrong. If you look back at my previous comment is even said that just because I don't see it happening in my circle doesn't mean it's not happening elsewhere. I was just curious if they had data on *why* dogs were put down.

And I don't think it's so much a ""people getting dogs and they're not prepared"" problem. I think it's more of a ""people not getting dogs from reputable breeders or shelter"" problem."
dogs,feeltm9,t1_feel98g,1579036362.0,Thank you!
dogs,feekdwb,t1_feejybl,1579035522.0,"I didn't say those were the only dogs being put down. Hence why I asked ""does it give the reason for euthanasia?"". I'm trying to learn more and you're just dismissing me"
dogs,feeixm3,t1_feeijxb,1579034684.0,"You know people, though. Before I  got my working line GSD, I did a *ton* of research. I knew how crazy they can be, I knew how bitey they can be, etc. I thought I was prepared. But I didn't *really* know until I brought her home."
dogs,feeiqio,t1_feeh247,1579034569.0,"Because I work in and am highly involved in the dog world. I have seen countless dogs surrendered and rehomed. And maybe 2-3 were euthanized for extreme behavioral cases. But just because it doesn't happen in my circle doesn't mean it's not happening somewhere else. But it still seems high to me. 

I'm still at work so I can't look closely, but does it say why these animals were euthanized? The more I'm in the dog world, the more I am a proponent of humane euthanasia. There is no reason why a dog who has an extreme bite history and has had an attempted rehabilitation to overcome that biting to be re-homed. It's not fair for the new family and it's not fair for the dog."
