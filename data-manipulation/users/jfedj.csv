This isn’t exactly a fantastic link as it isn’t a study but it is a starting point. 

It’s a lot more complex than a consensus of course. 

My understanding is that in the context of America though, low wage unskilled workers often do the jobs Americans wouldn’t bother doing anyway. Things like farm labour and custodian work. Unemployment rates in the states being low could support this. Of course unemployment is not a great metric of the well being of America.

One thing I am pretty sure of though, is that economists would agree that high skill workers are a benefit. 

Even larger numbers of low wage workers would be a benefit.

I probably overstated my initial claim, but both my comment and the one I was responding to were using rhetoric.

Edit: I love being challenged on these things because it tests if what I think is true is at all verifiable. I definitely need to do more learning in this area. So thank you!"

A combination of both, but the improvement of human rights and our ability to see the flaws in our culture and change should mean we can stop sexual abuse.


>For so many society's and culture all over history.male have been. Oppressing women. Your able to look, across continents and countrys,but also centuries and millenia. Rape and child abuse and,all sort of violent crimes. There so frequent. 

For this I would point to the development of patriarchal structures as humans became agricultural 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy

>Is it truly, a social,influence? Toxic masculinity?or is it biological??

If it’s all biological then there is no free will in the matter. Men cannot be blamed for their actions because biology forced them to do it. If you don’t believe this, as I don’t, then there is absolutely a social element without even need sources other than logic to confirm this.

>I have trouble believing it only social..to many coincidences... how is, a wealthy male who grow up in New York in 2000 commit rape with no hesitation... but also, a poor male who grow up in egypt in 200...there also likely to be abuser... such a coincidence? 

This is a bad hypothetical that basically just begs the question. Yes there are rapists in all societies, this doesn’t really prove anything.

>But that being said.if there just biological inferior morally and Spiritually. 

This is an ad-hominem against an entire group. It also has some extraordinary claims. I would ask you to prove that all men have a worse sense of morality and are biological inferior. It’s a weird thing to try and measure.

Spirituality has nothing to do with anything. It’s largely irrational and is fine to partake in but is completely amoral until it makes people take actions.

>That's not an excuse...they still need to act right. 

Hence it is impossible to use a fully biological argument while sustaining common sense morality.

>As part of being human.we have free will. 

If you believe we have complete free will then men can change and humans can create a society without rape. This also means that men are not biologically predisposed to commit rape.

>Even if they're inferior and inclined to,commit evil. 

Ad-hominem which relies on you begging the question earlier. This statement doesn’t help your argument which you pretended to be a question.

>Just a question XD

It’s good to ask them.

Edit: here it is


>For this to be entirely socialisation, that means it would be possible to socialise females to commit the vast majority of sexual crimes and socialise males to commit less than 1%. 

Ok here is a premise

>There are no societies where that happens anywhere in the world. 

The implied conclusion is that because there are no societies like this it must be genetic.
This conclusion doesn’t follow even if the premise is true because you could still in theory have create such a society unless of course it is entirely genetic which needs to be proven. In short the lack of evidence for something doesn’t make something else true. This is an argument from ignorance fallacy.

The argument also reads a circular because the premise implies that sexual violence is genetic and the implied conclusion agrees with it.

>Violent pornography is available to both sexes but moms aren't watching and creating 'barely legal son abused by mom' videos, or 'teen boy anally tortured by gang of huge women' or anything that men accept as mainstream porn when women and girls are the victims.

There is ‘violent’ porn of men. Also women are searching for violent porn for one reason or another. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/bm9w7v/why-are-so-many-women-searching-for-ultra-violent-porn

>We see the same dynamic in animals; females don't rape males, or their babies or other species. Males do the vast majority of sexual violence in every species.

The implied conclusion here being that “as seen generally in nature, therefore applies to humans”
This is also flawed. It’s a hasty generalization of both rape in animals but also how that applies to humans

>With that level of evidence, the burden is on men to prove it is socialisation and can be changed. Until men change, we don't have any proof that men can become as nonviolent and non rapist as women so it doesn't really matter what is causing it. 

You basically haven’t proven anything

>People won't take their kids to a man's house for daycare instead of a woman. Does that give parents a bad rap? Or is it only feminists who should delude themselves about the disparity between the sexes?

Not allowing your kids to stay over at someone’s house isn’t immoral. It might not be fair equal treatment, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a valid reason for it.


There is an argument to be made for sexual violence being genetic but this particular one is malformed. We could construct a better one.

AskPinkPillers,ff52d84,t3_erow74,1579578346.0,No one can reasonably disagree with this. People can argue with whether or not women have it worse but they can’t really argue with this statement.

>Over the ensuing decades, Roosevelt's Democrats embraced several tenets of modern American liberalism, while the Republican Party tended to favor conservatism."
AskPinkPillers,ff51fi9,t1_ff4a6cg,1579577641.0,Then why did you post a video about hyenas as a response to how matriarchy solves toxicity issues?
PoliticalCompassMemes,ff51a0o,t1_ff4uat7,1579577525.0,That’s a good way of thinking about that I hadn’t considered.
AskPinkPillers,ff49y3r,t1_ff494m3,1579558753.0,"Did you just compare humans to hyenas? lol

Hyenas have a super fucked social dynamic as well, from a moral human standpoint.





Bloody post limits."
AskPinkPillers,ff48ysm,t1_ff48qgf,1579558141.0,How exactly does matriarchy solve that though?
PoliticalCompassMemes,ff48wns,t1_ff44duf,1579558104.0,Basically everything on this sub is a straw man/hasty generalization. It’s hard to classify an entire group into a meme.

Edit: Thank you for the replies. They have definitely helped.

I also love how this has a bit of unity going on."

facepalm,ff35mpk,t1_ff2kw2q,1579534245.0,"Ok bud. First off the democrats are for the most part not leftists, they are right wing/centrists for the most part. Ok well here we go again, East Asian vote at about 79% support for Clinton in 2016 [seen here](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/18/524371847/trump-lost-more-of-the-asian-american-vote-than-the-national-exit-polls-showed). On your racial and ethnic minorities you are wrong again depending on your definition [latino/hispanics making up ~16% of the population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States). You do understand that trump having black support doesn’t mean he’s not a racist right? And [this here suggests black eligible voter support for trump was at 6% and puts Hispanic support for trump slightly higher than the other source](https://www.people-press.org/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/)"

I don’t care right now to argue about your other claims but I’ll come back tomorrow and touch up on your statements then."
unpopularopinion,ff2jydf,t1_ff1xwnk,1579509566.0,It’s possible to do both... I would think it’s much easier to say adopt don’t shop then fix the systemic issues that are often the cause of human suffering. This may be one of the reasons.
