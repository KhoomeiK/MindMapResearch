He basically went all in on a bunch of really bad investments that ended up being wildly successful. He had no business achieving what he did. He bought a bunch of worthless continental dollars for fractions of pennies and then sold them back to the government for more than what he paid. Bought all the whale bones he could get his hands on, just before male corsets became fashionable. Shipped coal to Newcastle, a major coal producer, because he had been tricked. Except the coal miners went on strike just as the coal got there. He was seriously delusional, but it somehow worked in his favour."
TumblrInAction,fe4e8wl,t3_enja7d,1578858384.0,"I tend to avoid talking shop, religion, or politics at the table. A lot of people think it’s sophisticated, but it’s actually incredibly rude. Most people don’t know how to keep a discussion from turning into an argument when they disagree on key points. The table is a time for people to come together peacefully. Not to fight."

HistoryMemes,fd6r6af,t3_ek5qlr,1578194714.0,"Carthage and Egypt were populated by western Asian peoples. Mansa Musa was from Mali, and while he was extraordinarily rich, his philanthropy was damaging to many economies. I wouldn't exactly consider it an accomplishment. Numidia road on the coat-tails of Egypt in my opinion. And Africa as the birthplace of humanity is very debatable. In the last several decades, the theory has shifted to Europe as the birthplace. Not because of the Nazi Aryan ideology, but because fossil evidence has shown early hominids developing at least 200,000 years before African hominids in the northern Mediterranean."
TumblrInAction,fd6ozjf,t3_ek5bgd,1578193980.0,"The marriage contract is that the man promises his labour to care for the wife and the children in exchange for her reproductive abilities. This was meant to replace a communal system in which everyone was expected to contribute, only the leaders were allowed to breed, and there was no real motivation to care. By introducing the marriage contract, suddenly men had a reason to contribute. The onus was on them to care for the children they produced. They were effectively THEIRS to ensure they were cared for. This led to advancements as men had to find new and innovating ways of ensuring their guaranteed offspring survived.  


Marriage kicked off civilization and motivated men. That's why they feel entitled."

LifeProTips,fd6ed2d,t3_ejyzyw,1578189688.0,"I much prefer telling people that I teach literacy to saying I'm a Health and Safety Manager. I would be paid much more to do the latter, but I turned it down for the optics. I have a much higher upward mobility if I keep working at the school than if I work in the mining industry. If I keep at it, I can eventually go do what I really want to do. So having an eye for the future is also important."

todayilearned,fcwmyq1,t3_ej92qw,1578030228.0,"That's only if you count his voyage as starting in Spain. He sailed East to the Philippines first before sailing West, back to Spain, and then starting another expedition West. If you consider Philippines his starting point, he made a contiguous journey West around the globe."

TumblrInAction,fcruvpe,t3_eik520,1577906931.0,It’s a good analogy. Just not for this. My first thought was when Trump said something along the lines of there are communists in the Democrats and 4 of them stood up to say they weren’t while the rest of the party ran to defend them. He didn’t even name names. This would be a good analogy for that.
