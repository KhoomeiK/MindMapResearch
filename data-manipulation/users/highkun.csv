I owned a shotgun and all I thought about was how traumatizing the brains on the walls and carpet would be to the people that have to clean that shit up, and to whoever finds my exploded head, that image is gonna destroy them and that was the only thing keeping me from doing it. I thought about cleaning up other people’s brains and I decided I was not going to subject other human beings to that kind of shit.

There was also another reddit post about pieces of someone’s dad’s brain still found stuck onto ceiling and crevices years after suicide by shotgun. That’s fucked."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffbe3tr,t1_ffbdxng,1579761397.0,Is “male gamer friends” not a clear enough indication that I’m referring to a very specific type of people? Have you not seen my other comments and replies to other people voicing different opinions that are right above you?

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffbd4ei,t1_ffbcrea,1579760301.0,"????? 

I said there’s a fundamental biological difference between male and female as in how they choose mating partners, males look for physical attributes that might indicate a better mother/offspring, big breasts and ass and such. Never mentioned “biologically shallow”, how the fuck does anything become biologically shallow? Be a plate?

Edit: and you edit your entire comment after I’ve commented, nice"
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffbasui,t1_ffbao82,1579757806.0,"I never said anything like “all men”. I guess someone doesn’t read my comments but okay.

Oh also this https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17380374/

“On average, men ranked good looks and facial attractiveness more important than women did (d = 0.55 and 0.36, respectively), whereas women ranked honesty, humor, kindness, and dependability more important than men did (ds = 0.23, 0.22, 0.18, and 0.15).”

Like I said in my other comments, nothing wrong with liking good looks, it’s how you’re biologically wired. Some men don’t fucking grow out of that and some do. Don’t just get triggered and misinterpret my comment."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb92qx,t1_ffb8tj1,1579755659.0,"Ha, I’ve met some of these old dudes myself. Not every old white male is a saint like you. My dad is old and loyal but you can’t deny there are shallow dickheads out there. I was literally harassed by one trying to touch my hand and ask me how old I was while proceeding to rant about n*ggers.

Why don’t you stop getting defensive and admit there are assholes in every age group and gender?"
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb8o27,t1_ffb8hov,1579755205.0,"I’ve stated this below, anyone that prioritize looks are too immature for long term relationships. And trust me I’ve heard enough stories about old dudes to know that they wouldn’t say no to hot college chick pussy."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb8i8f,t1_ffb7ecp,1579755009.0,like i said below I agree that shallow people doesn’t discriminate between genders. I guess I just hang out with classier people and stay the fuck away from tinder and dating apps.
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb61v3,t1_ffb587n,1579752752.0,"I agree with your point. My female friends are mostly bookworms, so not as shallow as the ones you can find in a sorority i presume. I just don’t think any sane and mature individual would think looks is all that matters and personality can be disregarded when it comes to looking for a long term partner. Both are important tho, I won’t disagree. But out of all the people that I’ve known to date because hot, none are still together."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb52k6,t1_ffb4u6a,1579752003.0,"I agree. From the stories I’ve heard those are also only casual dates that don’t last long. And if you get lucky and they’re both hot and nice then you’ve hit the jackpot, but that doesn’t usually happen."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb42pj,t1_ffazyjz,1579751258.0,"Half of my friends are in long term relationships with guys the same height as them, chubbier and uglier too. I’ve noticed it’s always never about appearance when girls choose partners, but with guys the face and body is everything. Every single time relationships is mentioned in a conversation with my male gamer friends they always focus on the appearance, then proceed to compare which one of their exes/gfs/crushes are the prettiest and which one is the skinniest. I’ve had multiple dudes tell me “of course she’s gotta be hot, the face is everything”. No chick has ever said that to me, unless she’s a Korean boy band fangirl. I think it’s true when ppl say there’s a fundamental biological difference between male and female. 

Edit: biological difference as in what both genders look for when they choose a mating partner. This study clearly states that men value physical attributes more than females. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17380374/"

AskReddit,ffam7am,t1_ff9ktv7,1579739220.0,I’m taking a gap semester after 2 yrs of art school and I’m considering transferring to a regular college instead. The deadlines killed my ability to create.

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffah5qz,t1_ffaft6x,1579735634.0,"We’ve dated for 2 years, I know he’s a misguided good person that has the ability to turn around. To his credit he’s very pro choice, pro female leaders and all that less “radical” feminist ideas, he also has the ability to recognize toxic masculinity. I think he just got himself a bit lost in the toxic side of gamer culture. Also he only browses 9gag which is full of made up articles about feminnazis trying to ruin white male. 

The extreme left leaning environment we’re in (the art school) does have some more bad apples than the normal world. My SO is a tall big white guy with a full beard, a very macho look, and I can see how that attracts some assholes here to project their insecurities onto him. Assholes know no boundary and all they need is an outlet. I just want him out of this toxic environment asap."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffafila,t1_ff9ixxt,1579734539.0,"My SO is white and he goes to an art school, with a ultra left population. You can’t imagine the amount of times he complains about being oppressed by SJWs and blue haired feminazis 

He’s beginning to turn into one of those gAmErS that think infantilizing women is not a thing and if you’re triggered by being called “baby girl” by your boss you’re a snowflake."

Fucking weird."
AskMen,ff0po0f,t1_fezgfxe,1579471107.0,"It’s also not just limited to men. Me and my female best friends do this as well. We’ve known each other for a third of our lives but we never tell each other “love you”, however we do insult each other and call each other idiots and fags constantly. Only a few of my friends (especially white girls) are quick to both the “love you”s. It’s only been recently that we opened up about our depression and troubles. I definitely feel embarrassed at the thought of expressing true emotions and I think my friends do as well, but growing up we’ve matured a lot and realized it’s okay to talk about personal shit with your friends without thinking about it as a sign of weakness."

unpopularopinion,fev75hu,t1_fetj6wl,1579393919.0,I’m sure social media plays a big part but you can’t blame the whole thing on “kids not going outside”. It’s bad parenting like beating the shit out of you kids or dismissing their pain that make them fucking depressed. There are kids that grew up with phones who turned out completely fine and there are kids who gets emotionally abused by their parents so they resort to social media and video games as outlet. I was beaten shitless as a kid and social media was what held me together.
