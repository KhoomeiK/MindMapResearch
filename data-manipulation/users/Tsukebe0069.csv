Usually that is caused by overloading the data file for a single chunk

Minecraft Bedrock can't process a chunk with 50Mb or more data in it, so it crashes the game or loses data associated with that particular chunk...  Usually it just deletes some of the more data-heavy blocks...  shulker boxs, named entities in item frames, custom books, chests with lots of metadata items...  

You know, the valuable stuff that's hard to get.

Drop chance foa a skull with looting 3 is about 5.5% so roughly one in twenty.  So to get 4 skills you need to kill an average of 75 to 80.

With looting 2 it is 4.5%, meaning about one in 22, drops skulls.

With looting 1 it's 3.5%, so one in 30.

Without looting enchantments it is 2.5%, so one in fourty.

Spawning algorithms are wierd, and extremely math heavy in explaining, but you should assume that in a 'good' area two or three wither skeletons spawn every five seconds, so the real limiting factor for 'how quickly can I get 4 skulls' is 'how quickly can I bring the wither skeletons to me, or get to them'

If the answer is 'no' be advised that attempting to frame something so large and delicate may not be feasible.

If yes:

Purchase 2 full sheets of 1/2"" plywood or mdf board.

Mark BOTH sides of one of the plywood sheets that will be on the back of the final framed piece.

Transfer the puzzle with the back of the puzzle touching the back plywood sheet, and place the other plywood sheet on top,  securely locking into place very tightly with straps, clamps or something similar.  This will allow you to transport the puzzle to your work area, and handle it in one piece.

Once at your work area place the puzzle face-side down, and remove the back plywood piece carefully. 

Apply an insane amount of adhesive to the back of the puzzle. I would reccomend spray adhesive so it doesn't soak the puzzle warping it or sticking the face side to the plywood.  Wear respiratory protection.

Gently lay a layer of felt or other thick cloth onto the back of the puzzle, then place a layer of plastic wrap on top of the felt.   This plastic wrap is to prevent accidentally bonding the plywood to the felt.  Put back on the second sheet of plywood.  Clampdown.  

Optional step, flip over, unclamp, remove front plywood, plastic wrap to prevent glue leaking upwards.  Plywood on, clamp down.

Allow a few hours to a few days (based on the adhesive manufacturers reccomend cure time) to fully dry and cure.  DO NOT RUSH THIS STAGE.

Purchase some tabletop or countertop epoxy while waiting.  Crystal clear type, no tint, self leveling.

SEVERAL UNITS OF TIME LATER

Invert/revert puzzle and plywood sandwich so that the face is downward.  Remove back plywood.  Remove plastic wrap.  Apply copious amounts of adhesive to the felt.  Glue felt to the back plywood.  Clamp and wait again per manufacturers specifications.

The reason for the felt is to be sure that seasonal movements of the wood doesn't damage the puzzle.

SEVERAL ADDITIONAL UNITS OF TIME LATER

Flip plywood puzzle sandwich to have the front picture facing up, remove top plywood.  Carefully trim excess plywood from backing off.  Clean up the edge using a flush trim bit on a router if possible for a sharp clean edge.

Mix epoxy per manufacturers specifications and pour/flow over the top to at least 1/8"" (~2mm) thickness.  Remove all air bubbles either by vibrating the board or using a butane torch.

Allow epoxy to cure.

Attach hanging hardware directly into the back plywood (being careful not to pierce completely thru into the puzzle and ruin it)

Hang on the wall.

Minecraft,fee8kva,t1_fedzgyj,1579028627.0,"Bedrock has a WIERD spawning system, and a totally BROKEN (in a bad way) despawn system. 

Unlike Java, where mobs spawn within 128m )block) radius, and despawn outside of the 128m radius, bedrock uses the 'simulation distance' setting to set the spawn radius.

Additionally in bedrock version there are several additional steps to mob spawn not used in java.

In bedrock there are three types of spawn - surface, cave and mob_cage, each with their own independent mob cap and spawn saturation limit (a feature only on Bedrock)

If a mob spawn happens at >y=64 AND at sky light level <13 it is a 'cave spawn', otherwise it is a 'surface spawn'.  Some exceptions occur.

The mob cap for hostile mobs 64 mobs for cave spawn and 32 mobs for surface spawn.  In Bedrock endermen are hostile spawns for the purpose of the mob cap calculations.

Additionally, there is the mob saturation limit, that checks the full number of hostile mobs combined (surface, cave and mob_cage) within an 10 chunk RADIUS of the player, including 'unloaded' chunks outside of the simulation distance.  If the maximum amount of hostile mobs (I believe 64 total, but I might be wrong) exist then no additional mobs will spawn.

Mob despawn is stupid on bedrock, and I hate it very much.

Despawn ONLY occurs when ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE TRUE: the player is within 64m radius, the chunk is loaded in simulation distance, the mob is at full HP, the mob is at light level >12 (so within 3m radius of a torch), the player is NOT within 16m radius, the mob has not been nametag, the mob has not picked up an item, the mob is standing on a block recieving a random tick check.

This effectively means that mobs do not despawn in bedrock version, and that you have to spawn proof a full 336x336 area that is chunk aligned with your AFK area.

The ONLY truly effective XP hostile mob farm on bedrock that I have found is using the area around the outside of the main end island to spawn endermen.

Phone/tablet stands are a good way to practice exact placement of cuts and fitting together 3D shapes

Engraved slabs with a router are a fun way to practice router control

Hi!  I'm a professional chef, and have been woodworking since my father taught me when I was knee high to a grasshopper (he was a master carpenter, cabinetmaker and honest to god chimney sweep).

Wood from a big box store is fine for bowls and stuff, but be advised that most construction lumber isn't very high quality...

It tends to be softer wood with wide growth rings, making it dent and gouge easier.  It's great to learn on, but your projects will require slightly more effort and be slightly less durable (but significantly cheaper).

As for your question about finishing the wood for food contact...  complex questions have complex answers. 

Most 'natural' finishes are fine and food safe.  Shellac, lacquer, beeswax, linseed oil, mineral oil and a few others are all fairly inexpensive, and easily obtained and stored.  Many stores (and Amazon) sell 'butcher block oil' (which is mostly mineral oil), which is specifically formulated for food contact safety and is easily stored and used (and easily cleaned up if spilled or misused) and is very forgiving of incorrect applications.

A mineral oil finish will be safely washed with dish soap and scrubbers but may require an occasional reapplying...

Note however that NONE of the above finishs are NFS appropriate or approved for high volume commercial food contact.   

If you don't mind screaming in rage over nearly microscopic air bubbles, disgusting smelling finish that takes days to dry and cure, and a price point north of a hundred dollars per quart...  there are a variety of epoxy resins that are NFS foodsafe AND will harden and protect your wood masterpieces to the extent that they will easily survive hundreds and hundreds of trips thru a commercial dishwashing machine that gets above 180°f and STILL never need refinishing..."

Just buy cove base, crown moldings or similar wood.

If you want to make a special table for jigsaw puzzles and board games (inset table top so you don't lose pieces) custom crafts and lots of shelves...

Get:

1 - a used small jobsite tablesaw it'll fold up for storage and handle most household sized projects for about $100.  Buying new is also an option, but usually doubles the price.

2 - a small (8"" or 10""), new, compound miter saw from Harbor Freight (or other discounted dealer) with a good high tooth blade.  Probably about $50, don't bother buying used because new is pretty cheap unless you trust the seller.  

3 - a cheap router with a separate bench, 1/4"" bits will do anything household.  Ryobi malters a combo for about $109.99 when it's on sale.  You can buy just the router and MAKE the table with the first 2 tools ;) but the table is cheap...  You can buy used versions cheap on craigslist or Facebook, but prices vary ALOT regionally.  The router table will let you make ogee and other shapes for frames really easily.  Without the table it's great for rounding over the outside edges of frames, tables, cutting boards and anything else...

4 - a new random orbital palm sander.  They only cost about $15 or so brand new, buying used is just asking for trouble.  They make more expensive versions, but a cheap-o from HarborFreight or hobby lobby or Michaels will do for most small projects.  Sure, you can sand frames, tabletops and anything else by hand, but trust me, it's gonna save time."
