The issue is being comfortable alone. Loneliness has drove me into depression. It’s impossible to cope with if there’s no one listening out there.

To find the one or two people that you mentioned you can trust is in itself a hard task and requires quite the opposite. Finding a person who can accept you as who you are is quite rare in this ableist society today. And you have to keep socializing to search."

SuicideWatch,fcsixhl,t1_fcsafn2,1577917398.0,"Yeah it’s true that a lot of people either don’t know how to or don’t care about it. I’ve been told by a friend with depression that even some criminals don’t feel self hate for the shit they’ve done so I shouldn’t be hating myself bc I’m better than them. While I understand his point, it doesn’t nullify the fact that I’m not happy with myself.

As toxic as some parts of Reddit can get, only this sub can really give us a place to be open and not be judged with cliched responses while being completely honest"
SuicideWatch,fcsib8c,t3_ei4ogh,1577917043.0,"I’ve been there. Autism sucks. It sucks the life out of the affected.
I tried getting help. At the end I realized nobody truly helped me bc they don’t even understand or aren’t willing to understand. It’s a complicated thing."
SuicideWatch,fcsau7k,t3_ei9t6q,1577913942.0,"Been there.
Every time I fuck up socially I beat myself up (not literally) about it. It just brings up all these terrible feelings again. I hate having to explain myself.

I’m done being called a creep. I’m done being thrown aside for “weirdness”. I’m done with being avoided like the plague.

For now I only have empty hopes of living like others or finding a group of people who understand and accept me.

It’s less of I don’t want to live, but rather I wanna live differently.

Edit: I don’t want to seem like I’m validating some of these thoughts"
SuicideWatch,fcs7yu6,t3_eijvk5,1577912713.0,"I feel the same way. Not having any plan to end it but just not caring if I’d die the next minute.
I have definitely been there, where games and music didn’t bring me happiness and self help was bullshit. And not eating nor taking care of myself. It was a really toxic period of time where I would just waste away in my dorm.
I have also considered suicide by car. Ended up enjoying some spirited backroads driving. At one point it was the only thing I was ""living"" for. I was more worried about surviving a crash and having to deal with insurance and everyone else.
I’m terrible at talking to people with such feelings. But just saying that someone’s been there and can relate."
SuicideWatch,fcs45eu,t1_fceu6zs,1577911203.0,A comment that has actually brought me to my tears. I have been struggling with the same situation to date. 2 decades of pain and loneliness.
