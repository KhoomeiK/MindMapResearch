But he CAN still get what he wants because everyone knows he's good for the money in the long run and he has ways of getting large sums of money by properly going through the steps and making sure stock doesn't plummet."

hearthstone,ffh2ye5,t3_etl3w0,1579921690.0,"Just finished this Battlgrounds run with a 13 win streak and only taking 19 damage, all from Wrath Weaver. By far my most dominant run since I got back into the game around the end of November. Don't have any friends who play so figured I'd share it here. I know y'all don't see enough high-roll Wrath Weaver-Floating Watcher-Soul Juggler builds so thought you'd like mine. Also, the new 3/3 taunt demon is broken in Juggler builds, I had many throughout this run, granting me many free juggles."

All that being said, it's really only comparable for each racers natural habitat, a sled sog would lose in Phoenix and a human would lose in Anchorage."

Not saying he shoulda gone and blown his money but he needed to have left his town and moved to a larger city where one millionaire isn't worth a sizable portion of the town.

But yeah, the steps to winning the lottery and not spiraling are:

- tell no one
- get a good lawyer
- tell no one
- move to a new area
- tell no one
- plan ahead before collecting what you're gonna give away
- and finally, tell no one. once everything is ironed out you can tell your close family, if you trust them"

StardewValley,feoqhxk,t3_epzlks,1579303990.0,"If mushrooms are your thing, you should also know that there is a floor in The Mines that spawns red and purple mushrooms but there are some things you should know:

- it is between floors 80 and 120
- it spawns red and purple mushrooms (which are affected by botanist)
- it may or may not exist on any given day and more than one can exist at a time
- every night it moves up one floor (if it was on 93 one day, the next it will be on 92)
- it cannot exist on any floor with an elevator (if on 96 it will go to 95 but no mushrooms will spawn and then will proceed to 94)
- it will always have at least one green lantern on the walls
- it is repeatable multiple times per day

Using this I was able to grind half a stack of iridium purple mushrooms in a few in-game days. I use them as my main food source in Skull Caverns.
