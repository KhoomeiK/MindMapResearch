People also clueless of ADHD label difficulty to compete tasks as simply being lazy, which makes it difficult for ADHD person to seek help because they are ashamed that they’re voluntarily being lazy. If every stupid house chore, making appointments, making calls and such feels like you need to climb over a mountain before you can get your hands on it, odds may be that it’s a mental health  issue beyond your control.

Try lurking on r/ADHD and see if you relate to all our rambles about daily struggles with ADHD to see if you relate to it more than you thought. Of course it’s never good to self diagnose, so you should speak to a professional, just a suggestion if you’re wondering maybe you should get help."

Either way it might just be good to figure out ways to rediscover yourself. See a psychiatrist. At least a therapist. Maybe try taking Myer Briggs 16 personality test as a place to start.

Also, always ask for more raise than youâ€™re willing to settle for.

SCREENPRINTING,fdiy6zn,t1_fdivmnf,1578453748.0,"300dpi is when I do 2px. I only do 1px and paint in where itâ€™s needed when I really canâ€™t catch anything.

SCREENPRINTING,fdisik9,t3_ellh5n,1578450062.0,"Color separator here. Assuming this is 3 color and underbase with light blue, white highlight and black. Grab the whole shape of design without the background. Cut out the black ink area out of it, and contract whatâ€™s left by 2px. (You can do select>modify or use stroke). Add the white highlight areas back into the underbase.

Seeing that some blue areas are very detailed, for those areas I would maybe add back in an underbase thatâ€™s either not contracted at all or contracted by 1px instead of 2px. Black outlines should cover up any underbase peaking out if you hit it after flash, but you can expand the blue areas by a pixel or two if youâ€™re worried.

You should print the black screen if you want to capture all the details.

Thatâ€™s if itâ€™s photoshop. Illustrator you can offset by 0.5-1px."

Also thereâ€™s more than 400 episodes, so you can google for best episodes and they can see if they enjoy watching it together! The recurring theme is an elimination tag and hide and seek war. Each member has a Velcro name tag on their shirt which is their lifeline, and they ran around a particular location (mall, museum, etc) trying to rip it off of each other. They also often have secret â€œspyâ€ whoâ€™s task is to betray all the other members and complete their own agenda to win the game."
logodesign,fdfycir,t3_ekuwvi,1578373661.0,"Friendly neighborhood tip from a print shop art separator: always make your distresses bigger than you actually want on the shirt. Tiny dots will get squished together and disappear when printed. (There may be few oddballs like me who would open up the distress for you calculating this, but better to play it safe) Submit your art in RGB, not CMYK. 

Your distress actually looks fine as is for screen print though!

And on a shirt, that big text is going to end up on the stomach, which would look off balance. Try mocking up your design on a shirt before making future edits. Good design doesnâ€™t always equal good shirt design. I would recommend splitting your design in half. Put the bottom half(company name and hot peppers) on back of your shirt, and the top half (devil and the quote) on front of your shirt. or put the text as small left chest placement and devil on the back.

P.s. it would be fun if the devil had a little hot pepper in his mouth or breathing fire."
