If I want/need to make my own sandwich, I'll make a salted peanut butter one most of the time since that's both 1) *much* faster to assemble and clean up after/during than dealing than a meat-and-veggie sandwich and 2) if I don't put honey on it, vegan AKA much better for the environment than a meat sandwich.

Since the classes were nearly twice as long compared to a non-block scheduled school, non-AP/IB classes would be completely finished in a semester (for those curious, AP/IB classes rotated by day so students would stay fresh for the AP/IB testing in May) if they were during the regular day, while you could take a half-year class all by itself as a 1st/zero period if you needed to. 

I actually took my 9th grade Health class as a 1st period and didn't have to take Geography since my HS district didn't *require* students take Geography, they just needed it to fill out the rest of the time slot for 9th grade Health since 9th grade Health's only a half-year class in California where I went to HS.
