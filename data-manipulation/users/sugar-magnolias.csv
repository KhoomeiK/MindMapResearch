NoStupidQuestions,fff90yi,t1_ffehxry,1579878708.0,"Here’s how to tell the difference between a run-on and not a run-on:

Run-on: “We are out of eggs, I’m going to the store.”

Those two phrases (“We are out of eggs” and “I’m going to the store”) can **stand on their own**. They can both function as individual sentences because they both have a subject, a verb, and a complete thought. Therefore, you’d need to do one of the following: replace the comma with a period, replace the comma with a semicolon, or add a coordinating conjunction (remember these with the mnemonic device “FANBOYS”: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So).

Here’s how it would look with those corrections:

1. “We are out of eggs. I’m going to the store.”
2. “We are out of eggs; I’m going to the store.”
3. “We are out of eggs, so I’m going to the store.”

Not a run-on: “Hoping to catch the bus, John sprinted down the sidewalk.”

See how that first phrase before the comma can’t stand on its own? “Hoping to catch the bus” isn’t a complete thought. So this is **not** a run-on sentence, and a comma has been used correctly in joining the two clauses. 

Some more comma tips:

Always use a comma before *which*, but not before *that*. Examples:

“The biology class that she wanted to take is full.”

“The biology class, which she was hoping to take this semester, is full.”

When you’re introducing a quotation, it should look like this:

My professor said, “You should always use commas correctly.”"
NoStupidQuestions,fff7gk1,t1_ffepoiv,1579877632.0,Don’t need a comma before the phrase “run on sentences.” You’re not quoting anyone; you’re using the quotes to signify a technical term.

TwoXChromosomes,ffennpx,t1_ffemqgw,1579856158.0,"How can sexual intercourse and rape be the same thing when the definition of rape is “*forced* sexual intercourse”? That clearly makes them two different things.

Really, the issue at hand isn’t the definition of those two words, but the “definition” of virginity. We can decide that virginity doesn’t include rape because human beings decide the meaning of words, not dictionary gods. I mean, some people think it is impossible for two lesbians to lose their virginities to each other. Others think that you lose your virginity even if you only have oral sex. The definition of virginity is incredibly fluid, and it is pointless and cruel to tell someone that their concept of virginity is wrong.

If you’re just planning on eating a bunch of acid and think it’s going to magically cure your addiction.... then no. That’s not how that works. Psychedelics aren’t witchcraft. 

If, on the other hand, you are using psychedelics to supplement a rigid recovery plan and you have someone to guide your trip and help you reflect on what causes your addiction.... then yes. That could be helpful. Psychedelics can help you reflect on your destructive thought patterns, but it all has to come from *you*.

I’ll still answer it from my perspective though: After I was raped, I was terrified of all sexual contact. I involuntarily orgasmed while sobbing during my rape, so I felt disgusting and like my body had betrayed me. I can’t speak for all survivors, but I couldn’t have sexual contact for years afterwards because I associated what should have been a positive experience (orgasm) with a violent assault that ruined my life."

gatekeeping,fevuymm,t1_feu7skn,1579401844.0,Consider [SMART Recovery](http://smartrecovery.org)!! I am a recovering addict and I think it is way better than 12-step programs. I’ve been clean for 3 years now because of SMART (and a lot of other factors); I’m so glad I discovered it.
MurderedByWords,fevuczy,t1_feum3zi,1579401616.0,I believe the idea is that calling black women “angry” is a dog whistle for racists. It’s a shortcut they use to express racism without actually using explicitly racist words.

HobbyDrama,fevrxxj,t1_fevqrcy,1579400805.0,"I’m confused, are you upset that I care about kids who are getting bullied....? Or do you not think teachers in general should exist?"
HobbyDrama,fevqax8,t1_fepoexu,1579400206.0,So you’re blaming a child who was cyber bullied for having an opinion on a movie for allowing herself to be harassed by strangers online right now? Is that’s what is happening? Or are you telling OP that they shouldn’t care about a child being cyber bullied?
HobbyDrama,fevq1sz,t1_fepkws2,1579400104.0,Please read [my response](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/eq9q67/film_joker_ruined_film_twitter/fevp5ty/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to another commenter on this thread. Cyber bullying is a very very real thing.
HobbyDrama,fevp5ty,t1_fepqqls,1579399888.0,"Interesting you say “won’t someone think of the children.” I am a public high school teacher, and much of our training now involves how to identify and help victims cyber bullying over every other kind of bullying. “Online” is just where bullying happens now. When you tell kids “oh just log off and ignore them”, you are basically doing the equivalent of what horrible authority figures say to kids that have abuse hurled at them in the hallways. “Just ignore them, if you give them a reaction they’ll keep doing it.” “Just change your routine up and avoid them in the hallways.” That’s what kids hear when you say “just log off.” Most of high school social interaction happens on social media now, and it is incredibly ignorant to tell them to just ignore it; kids have killed themselves over online harassment from both their peers and strangers online. What happens online is very very real to them and affects them psychologically just like so-called “real” bullying."
