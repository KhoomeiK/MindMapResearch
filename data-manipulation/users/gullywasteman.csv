bipolar,fgjf4u7,t1_fgef34i,1580842729.0,What's the difference?
linux,fgiqseg,t3_ey169w,1580828810.0,"Getting a new laptop, considering dual booting it with ubuntu. Are there any tips for doing this? Things to avoid?

Can I potentially mess up my new laptop by doing this?"
bipolar,fgbtkvk,t1_fgbqbfl,1580666036.0,I'm in the UK so I wouldn't have to pay but the waiting list for an actual therapist is quite long and I doubt a GP would have the specialisation to actually recognise everything
bipolar,fgas0jb,t1_fgarezz,1580654744.0,"Fuck that sounds bad.

What sets you off? Is there a way you can channel it into a positive force without going too far?"
DecidingToBeBetter,ffetglv,t1_ffdsbxz,1579864736.0,Thanks
DecidingToBeBetter,ffetfxt,t1_fferflx,1579864710.0,Actually yes I've done that too and love it. Might do both alongside each other

Showerthoughts,femjcku,t1_felgvzb,1579258538.0,"Ok lemme rephrase it. The statistical distribution of numbers within Pi is random. Over a million digits, it’s found that each digit occurs in equal proportions. Despite Pi being the same number each time, it appears as if it were a random string of numbers. 

It’s always going to be the same for the first 1000 digits, and the next 1000. And the next..... Say you got to the end of Pi, calculated it far further than anyone ever has. Then find the next 1000. They’re unpredictable. Do this again and again. Eventually an arbitrary string of numbers will turn up along here."
Showerthoughts,feldz3d,t1_feldaj8,1579219937.0,It’s statistically improbable that it wouldn’t happen
Showerthoughts,felcx9m,t1_fel9onr,1579219232.0,Actually it’s a concept in number theory that any arbitrarily long string of numbers will appear in Pi at some point down the line.
Showerthoughts,felcgao,t1_fela3k1,1579218919.0,And translating it is a very simple process. Convert it into base 26. Maybe more if you want capitalisation and punctuation but that’s semantics
Showerthoughts,felca23,t1_fela3k1,1579218807.0,Yeah technically you’re right. Pi is exactly equal to only one thing. The digits in Pi are random in the sense that’s no pattern to them. That’s the point I’m trying to make.
PhysicsStudents,fei7hau,t3_ep6u7c,1579131994.0,"Starting a task is the hardest. It’s a psychologically well known behaviour that once a task is started, your mind is contemplating it and has more of a drive to complete it. 

Try not to go long stretches with no studying, I’d say no more than one day out of uni (or two for weekends).  One day can easily turn into a week and suddenly the catchup and dread gets worse. 

Things usually sink in the second time round aswell. It’s handy if you already have an understanding of the topic seeing the material again. So that helps.

Also problem questions are handy. Some topics don’t have so many so it gets tricky doing them. 

Further reading is nice aswell. Leonard susskin does a very good job of explaining things in his series of books “the theoretical minimum” and they make an easy read (for someone with half the mathematical literacy needed for the degree).

Lastly, I’m no fan, but drugs can help. Modafinil is handy at times. I run off it during this exam season. I highly dissuade from making it habitual, but on the odd occasion it helps."

darknet,fehl2t3,t1_fehg4b4,1579118724.0,Can you elaborate on this one? I’ve always heard for and against it
TheBigLezShow,fehkooi,t1_fehhy8z,1579118498.0,Would you (or your girlfriend) mind if i actually swapped it out for this one? It’s a higher resolution than the MS paint job that we’ve all come to love
