AmItheAsshole,feie8t2,t3_ep4bpf,1579136466.0,"NTA/NAH  depending how whether her parents actually listened to you and took care of their own child.  Everything else is irrelevant.  Doesn't matter if the kid is the sweetest angel or devil.  If you can't watch the kid, you can't watch the kid.  This is presumably an appointment that was scheduled some time ago, and not an emergency last minute thing.  Not your fault.

As to the kid being rude and nosy, I would maybe try to gently work that into your answers to the inquisitive kid?  Kids parents aren't going to teach them, you might as well start teaching her that it's impolite to ask people about their bills and stuff."

You know most of that in the last paragraph is bullshit, right?  You don't have to be a mother, you don't have to be skinny, you can be smart or feminist or whatever you want.  Tough part is people might give you shit about it.  I guess my advice is to learn to not give a fuck about peoples expectations, and don't spend time with assholes like that.  Not that that's easy."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fecoiep,t3_eo57sr,1578979155.0,"You can do it.  Kind of silly, but last time I had to have stitches taken out I took out my phone and looked at cute pictures of my cats and my niece and it was pleasantly distracting.  Cute cats solve many of lives problems."

AmItheAsshole,fe0b350,t3_endax5,1578808331.0,"NAH.  He was uncomfortable and he wasn't going to enjoy the experience of there was a m ale masseuse in the room.  Kinda stupid, but we all have our random quirks and preferences.   He was a bit of a dick about it but it sounds like he was just caught off guard and phrases things badly and apologized about it after.

Now if he's gonna start insisting that his wife can't have a male masseuse if she goes in for a session by herself, then I start to get worried."
