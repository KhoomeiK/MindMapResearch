Well, yes. I don't know. 

Because they were never called.

Because there was never a minority hearing.

See how that works? 

I have my suspects along with everyone else, such as Rudy Giuliani and Hunter and Joe Biden, but since the minority was denied the right to a minority hearing by the Democrats, I don't know who would have been called. 

>You're mad because the minority didn't get a chance to have their own hearing.

Well, yea. Of course I'm mad. Why wouldn't any sane American be mad that the Democrats so un-democratically denied their opposition a chance to speak?

>Even though they never specified one thing that they wanted to do that they couldn't that was related to Trump's impeachment inquiry.

Yes they did. They specified they wanted a minority-run hearing, known as a minority hearing. 

>Except the text messages

>and the printscreens of his whatsapp

>and the handwritten notes

...... none of which is identifying in any meaningful way. 

The handwritten notes are a complete joke, especially as they were written by Parnas himself.

The WhatsApp messages, at most, show that Parnas and Hyde disliked Yovanovich, and that Hyde was possibly observing her movements. But as theres been zero evidence that Hyde or even Parnas is in any way related to Trump that's at most strange, and not really impeachment worthy for the US President.

Since the text messages are the WhatsApp messages, I'll assume you mean the ones supposedly between Giuliani and Parnas, which are.... non-incriminating in any way? It's about Giuliani arranging a meeting with a Ukrainian, which is in no way illegal or immoral, since he was investigating corruption committed by Biden. 

The second round of supposed messages between Giuliani and Parnas are discussing how an advisor to Zelensky was probably assisting Hillary Clinton in her attempts to dig up dirt on Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign..... 

Again, not illegal in any way, as weve already established that that's exactly what Giuliani has been investigating this whole time. 
 

>and the call logs, 

>and his emails

Since no call logs were released, I'll assume you had a temporary stroke and move on.

As for the email, it's from a member of Trumps legal team to an ex member of Trumps legal team, advising the ex member that he could represent Parnas on the trial for campaign finance violations. 

So..... also not illegal or immoral in any way? Not sure how this is evidence at all. Trump gave his blessing for a lawyer who used to work for him to represent two men charged with a crime in US court. Thats.... not really bad in any way. 


>oh, and his payment receipts for services rendered.

So, two strokes? Cause there was nothing even close to a payment receipt included in the document drop.

Mitch McConnell refused to promise that witnesses would be called, which is entirely within his right to do as the majority leader, so long as the majority agrees:

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/us/politics/impeachment-trial-witnesses.html

nottheonion,feizp37,t1_feix90i,1579151829.0,"Well, I assumed as adults I didn't need to spell this out for you, but I guess I was wrong.

A minority hearing is a chance for the minority to call witnesses and see testimony while under the moderation of a member of the minority. It allows them to speak freely without the chair directing the conversation one way or another. It allows them to set how long witnesses may be called for, along with how many; it allows them to set the agenda, call experts from the executive branch, and manage the following deliberation on the points made. 

These points are the reason why minority hearings are a tradition as old as Congress itself. We were founded on Republican principals, where the minority has a right to speak its side in a setting of their own control, rather than at the whim of the majority.

This is all pretty basic, Government 101 type stuff friend. You'll get to it sometime around your junior or senior year in high school.

This brings us back to your point about no witnesses being called:

Of COURSE no witnesses were called. Why would you call witnesses to a hearing run by the opposition, when you can call those same witnesses to your own hearing, which is provided for in the rules of the House? That would be pointlessly handicapping yourself. Better to wait for the minority hearing which, once again, is mandated by the House's own rules. 

And finally, you've failed to address the main point I've made: that as the House denied the minority a hearing, its only reasonable that the Senate do the same. That's only fair. And the majority doesn't have to have a hearing. It's entirely within either sides right to waive their own hearing. 

Once the Senate votes against the impeachment, if the House wants to try again and this time play fair and follow their own rules, then I would expect the Senate to do the same. And if they don't, I'll be right with you in condemning that. But until the House plays fair, there's no reason for the Senate to do so."
