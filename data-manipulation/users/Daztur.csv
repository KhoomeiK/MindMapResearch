If you want sweet you have to put in a LOT of honey (sometimes in stages) or bottle it before it's done fermenting, put it in a plastic bottle, wait for the bottle to bulge and then fridge it fast before you get a bottle bomb.

FG depends on yeast strain and how caramelized you make the syrup but can get pretty high so you want a yeast that doesn't produce too many boozy flavors (hence kviek, stuff is amazing).

Add some cinnamon for extra apple pie flavor. Just keep in mind it tastes very different from normal cider, STRONG cooked apple taste, like apple pie...

For a sweet drink wait until fermentation slows down, then bottle in plastic bottles w/o priming sugar, wait for the bottle to bulge and then fridge it.

dndnext,feo9i9d,t1_fen42da,1579296950.0,"If you read stories about the development of 4e it's a wonder we got as much of an edition as we did. The murder/suicide derailed the online tools, they scrapped most of the rules they had made and started mostly from scratch again VERY late in the design cycle, had different people working on the PC powers and the monsters without knowing what the other was doing, etc. etc. As it stands there are a lot of great ideas in 4e but it badly badly needs a few more drafts.

The other big problem with 4e is that it can be a lot of fun if you have action movie pacing with just a small handful of big sprawling climactic fights per adventure but if you try to run a standard DnD adventure in which the party gets slowly ground down by attrition over the course of a long series of small scirmishes (ie a standard dungeon crawl) then it's pretty much unworkable. I mean just look at what a trainwreck KotSF is.

Also last session we had a new player who had never played any RPGs join the party at 8th level. That's not really ideal in 5e (would be no issue at all for a non-caster in TSR-D&D) but it works. It just wouldn't work at all in 4e at 8th level, let alone really high levels."

dndnext,femk737,t1_fekko61,1579259727.0,Yeah it's really annoying how 5e sorcerers aren't distinct at all. They should've kept wizards (and only wizards) as full-on Vancian and sorcerers as an alternative for people who don't like Vancian magic. As it stands they don't have too much of a purpose.
dndnext,femk1h9,t1_fekfc2n,1579259514.0,">Gamist language. Everything in 4E was clean and easy to read. You knew definitively what something did, and could tell at a glance rather than taking a minute to read.

That had a lot of good effects (very easy to reskin everything) but it did have negative effects as well. How they were written contributed to the issue of 4e having a wall made out of tigers with tigers on top between the crunch (rules) and the fluff (in-world fiction, flavor text etc.). In some cases it wasn't clear what a specific power was actually DOING in physical in-world terms (which made it hard to use them in creative or off-label ways) or isn't wasn't clear if you should ever use the flavor text of an ability to adjudicate what it does (the famous ""can you trip a gelatinous cube"" issue).

dndnext,femhl6i,t1_felnwes,1579255941.0,Yeah they should've had 4e encounter/daily powers with triggers that made them only usable (or more powerful) if bloodied or if other conditions came up so you couldn't just spam them at the start of every fight.

dndnext,fem2sqx,t3_epm10e,1579237875.0,"A lot of good ideas here. Am going to make a few quibbles though:

\-It's just plain easier to run D&D (and many other RPGs as well) with certain genres than with others. For example it's generally easier to run Swords and Sorcery well with D&D than Tolkenesque High Fantasy. It's generally easier to run goofy than serious and it's generally easier to run opportunistic rat bastards than shining paragons of chivalry (ran a game based on the Icelandic Sagas in which many protagonists are bloody-minded greedy assholes and the PCs kept on doing the sort of things that Saga protagonists did without even trying to). It's often good to just go with the flow and run Cugel the Clever than to try to get a different tone. Of course it's possible to run with different tones but few new GMs it's a whooooooooooole lot easier to run Dying Earth than Lord of the Rings.

\-For getting a more serious tone I find that it's often good to ratchet up the difficulty rather than try to make the PCs seem like badasses. If I feel safe I can goof off, if I'm dancing on the edge of death I have to stay in focus. For example during a game of The Warren I ran recently (Apocalypse World meets Watership Down) how pathetically weak their rabbits were kept people terrified and on edge and made for great survival horror. A lot of people act like clowns because there's no consequences to that (especially if the DM is running a bad railroad the PCs will still be given the quest even if they mouth off all the time and act like jerks because that's where the train tracks are going). If bad shit happens if they piss people off they start paying attention more. You can organize entire campaigns around ""wait for the players to act like asshats to important people and have those people be pisssed off and act accordingly.""

\-Good points about narrating failure in different ways giving the right tone."

I remember reading an article with quotes from Western factory managers in Meiji Japan complaining about Japanese workers that went 100% against all of the modern stereotypes of Japanese people. The author's argument was that culture doesn't account for economic development, but rather economic development changes culture. If things are stable and prosperous that frees people up for longterm thinking etc. You can see the same thing in the other direction in some Rust Belt etc. areas. After the economy tanks you get all kinds of cultural dysfunction sprouting up that weren't there before do much.

Another good example of this is Obama. He wore the exact same clothes every day as president because he had so many decisions to make as president that he decided to minimize any other decisions he had to make, even really simple shit like ""what shirt should I wear?"" Poor people are the exact opposite. If you're poor you have to make a shit ton of decisions like: what am I doing about childcare, how do I pay the bills, can I afford this meal, can I go to the doctor, what can I do about a bunch of family crises, what can I do to be safe in my neighborhood, what can I do to fight for a good education for my kids in a shitty school system, how can I look presentable for a job interview and on and on and on and on.

And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let's have three pennorth of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice-cream! Put the kettle on and we'll all have a nice cup of tea! That is how your mind works when you are at the P.A.C. level. White bread-and-marg and sugared tea don't nourish you to any extent, but they are nicer (at least most people think so) than brown bread-and-dripping and cold water. Unemployment is an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated, and especially with tea, the English-man's opium. A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread.""

It's like the genetics argument.

Genetics can make you fat, but not because genetics fucks up your CICO. Being poor can make you fat, but not because you can't buy dirt cheap healthy food. Lentils, frozen veggies, chicken legs etc. are crazy cheap.

Genetics can fuck with your hunger signals so that it's much much harder to eat only the calories need with some genes than with others. Being poor fucks with your head in so many ways. Having stress piled on your head all day and so many decisions to make just to keep your head above water makes it harder makes it so much harder psychologically to not just say ""fuck it"" and buy one of the only luxuries you can afford (junk food). Also I splurged last night on some really awesome sashimi which was also really healthy, when you don't have any money it's hard to have a splurge meal that's also healthy.

So poor people do have an excuse (the stress of being poor has really bad impacts on long-term planning etc.) but I don't buy the ""poor people are fat because of food desserts"" argument as much besides a rounding error."
fatlogic,fdsqnc4,t1_fdsik3x,1578706688.0,"Depends on the person, some people get ravenous after running while others get upset stomachs and can't eat much. If I have a really hard run I feel sick to my stomach if I eat more than a little right afterwards even though I really need the calories (later though...). 

Also I really like long slow distance (trail running especially). At a slow jog I get into Captain America mode (""I can do this all day"") and since it's really enjoyable I can get big piles of calories burned if I have the time."
fatlogic,fdsq1st,t1_fdspbmv,1578706464.0,"Yeah, waist to height ratio works a  lot better, especially as abdominal fat is the most unhealthy. I guess you could throw it off a bit by doing all the sit-ups but even that's going to be really marginal.

And it's not so much about giving the benefit of the doubt to the normal bits of fat logic we get on this sub (except you sometimes get rather jerky comments about ""fat consequences"" on this sub), but rather not going to the other extreme about normal day or day stuff."
fatlogic,fdspno9,t1_fdsjql6,1578706322.0,Same here. Also if you get in shape it gets a LOT easier to burn calories. Of course that doesn't help much to start out but it helps a lot later as it's a lot easier to keep your weight down if burn thousands of extra calories a week even if doing so would make you keel over when you start out.

fatlogic,fds5me0,t3_ems7pb,1578694886.0,"I've been posting on this sub long enough (well over two years now) to notice a lot of good things but also some blind spots as well. There seems to be a strain of Fatlogic logic because there is a whole category of true things that'll get you downvoted heavily here, which doesn't make any sense. So I'm going to rant a bit:

-It's totally possible to lose weight without exercising but that's not a good idea. Being sedentary is unhealthy no matter how much you weigh.

-CO is half of CICO. Sure you get people who work out and then eat back twice as many calories as they burned because they ""deserve it"" and then wonder why they didn't lose weight. But that's no reason to go to the opposite extreme. Exercise is enormously helpful for many people in losing and keeping off weight. Sure not everyone can exercise enough to make a large difference to their CICO equation but not everyone can eat only one meal a day and that doesn't make OMAD bad. Different things work for different people.

-Not everyone had to count calories to lose weight. Different things work for different people.

-You get people on this sub taking BMI waaaaay too literally. Normal weight is such a wide range because different people have different builds and amouts of muscle. This sub seems to realize that a lot of people are still going to have too much fat on them at 24.9 BMI but the flip side of that coin is just as true: a lot of people are going to unhealthily thin if they drop under 20 BMI.

-It's not that hard for many guys (depending on build etc.) to get to 26 or so BMI while being lean. Just takes some consistency and time. Getting to 30 BMI while being lean? Whole other story, but getting your toes over the the line into overweight BMI with muscle isn't some herculean feat that only professional atheletes and bodybuilds can accomplish.

-Sexual dimorphism is huge. I've seen people on this sub claiming that a mile run burns 100 calories for everyone as if that'd be even close the the same number for a large guy vs. a petite woman.

-Genetics never trumps CICO but it really does make a difference. Genetics can make a massive difference in how hungry you feel. Some people just don't feel hungry much and can stay thin with very little effort and some people have food cravings basically 24/7 which makes a massive difference.

-Just because we get a lot of ludicrous exaggeration on this sub doesn't mean that unfair anti-fat bias doesn't exist. There are a lot of asshole trolls who love flaming fat people online and they don't go away when they log off of the internet."

fatlogic,fd7wjs8,t1_fd6q61g,1578211226.0,"Looked up the official definition of food dessert. It's no fresh food within one mile (for urban areas) and 10 miles (for rural areas).

I'm sorry but walking a mile and change to do some shopping isn't going to kill anyone. Take a bike and it'll take a few minutes. For the rural one, yeah, that's harder but with really rural areas fast food is often just as far away so in many cases it's more convenient to go grocery shopping since you have to do it less often. I remember as a kid the nearest McD was a 20 minute drive away. Nearest grocery store was far too but we weren't going out for fast food every meal...

I just really think that the number of people who are fat because they really want to buy veggies but can't is really small. Poor people are often fat because being poor is hella stressful and being under a lot of stress tends to lead to short term thinking. Most people have a lot harder time prioritizing their longterm health when they're juggling a half dozen short term crises. When they manage to put those fires out there's a natural tendency to say ""fuck it"" and go with what's easy and palatable that doesn't have the same impact when you have a more stable life. Also rich people can afford a whole slew of luxuries that don't make you fat while if you're poor junk food is one of the few luxuries you can afford. Don't think food desserts enter into this much at all."

To some extent this could be remedied with the fighter if you had a stack of splatbooks and chose the right feats (certain fighter charger and tripper builds were powerful but often boring to play one trick ponies) and things like the leap attack feat helped barbarians. The rangers weren't completely terrible but they lacked oomph badly and a druid was often as useful as having two rangers in the party. Compared to 3.5e, 5e rangers kick piles of ass."
