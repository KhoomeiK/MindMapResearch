AskReddit,ffh77h9,t1_fffgt9p,1579925046.0,My cat will hunt you down if you are trying to eat chocolate in the house.  She will try to take it out of your hand.
AskReddit,ffh6zpv,t1_fffg0g8,1579924869.0,One of mine will burst through the bathroom doors (not very well installed French doors).  You don’t expect it from such a small cat and she doesn’t do it every time.  She has scared me so many times.
AskReddit,ffh6dr0,t1_fffb1r9,1579924369.0,"We use to have those touch lamps that would come on when you touch any metal piece of the lamp.  My tabby cat figured this out and we thought it was cute, at first.  When she would decide she wanted something, say at 3am, she would touch the lamp to turn it on. Yeah, we got rid of those lamps."
AskReddit,ffh5mlq,t1_fffjmiq,1579923766.0,"My corgi is so jealous of my cats.  She sees them jumping up on the furniture or getting on our laps.  You can tell she wants to do the same, but those stubby corgi legs make it impossible for her to do those things. We joke that she wants to be a cat in her next life."
AskReddit,ffh51z0,t1_fffas05,1579923318.0,One of mine will play “peak-a-boo”.
AskReddit,ffh4tpx,t1_fffetjz,1579923140.0,"When my grandfather would dog sit our sheltie and she would “tattle” on us.  The moment she came through his door, she would sit down in front of him and just bark-talk.  Every time, and he would talk right back to her. So it became this thing with them.  I miss them both so much!"

legal,feb9l6x,t1_feb4urk,1578956622.0,"Well, I was wondering if we would have to sue to get the problem fixed?  Both home insurance companies are saying its the others responsibility, the HOA is saying it is the local county governments problem (the pipes under the streets) to fix and the gov is saying it's the HOA's responsibility.   I feel like I am getting lost in the middle and it is my home being damaged."
AskReddit,fdtym6s,t1_fdr84y5,1578724395.0,"For me, it’s always at the doctors office; where the entire family comes to the appointment.  I understand that, perhaps there is no one to babysit at home, you bring the kids.  But every time I go to my dermatologist there is no place for the other patients because 1 family has brought everyone: mom,dad,grandma,grandpa and all the kids.  Do you really need that many people to go with you to the dermatologist?"

AskReddit,fdiiq8y,t3_elbejj,1578443817.0,"Another one for me was my grandmother screaming ""you better dry it up"".  You know, after you get spanked for something your younger siblings did and you make the mistake of crying."
AskReddit,fdiijqx,t3_elbejj,1578443700.0,"Not so much a saying, but this sticks in my memory.  When I was first learning to drive all my relatives would tell me ""don't look at the hood of the car when you are driving"".   I was like what are you talking about?  I wasn't planning on looking at the hood of my car while I was driving, I was planning to look at the road in front of me.  But, as always, when someone tells you not to do something, it's the first thing you do.  I remember that way to often."

AskReddit,fcp9hfs,t1_fcmyjyh,1577855100.0,"We've been in a bad financial situation for a few years.  I finally got a new job with better everything - salary, benefits, work, people.   This was the first Christmas we've been able to buy presents.   I was so happy.  I didn't go overboard but it was so nice to be able to give gifts.  Everyone had been supportive during our hard time so it was a great feeling to be able to do something for them."
