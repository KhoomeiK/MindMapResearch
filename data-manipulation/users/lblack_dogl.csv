AskReddit,fdl5cus,t1_fdkxa01,1578517317.0,"Nope. You go to a grocery store and buy Visa gift cards with a credit card. Then you take those Visa gift cards to the post office or Walmart and buy money orders. You take those money orders to Bank A and deposit them. You transfer that money to Bank B and use it to pay off your credit card. You have generated a lot of points for maybe a few dollars (Visa gift card fee, money order fee). Rinse and repeat and you can get a trip to Hawaii for maybe a hundred bucks.

They don't profit from it. They are reimbursed for it. The issue comes from conservatives feeling that a fetus should not be removed and harvested in any manner.
