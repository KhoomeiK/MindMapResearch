Mambas and sea snakes (least the venomous ones... don't know if all sea snakes are venomous)... nah, I'm good. Hell, if the former has rattlesnakes I'd still visit (rattlers are nice, they don't really want to bite you... they let you know if you are getting too close. Of course idiots in rattlesnake roundups or those just killing any they find are eliminating the ones that have that instinct - and are the reason for at least half of rattler bites. You want to eliminate 50% of rattler bites? Stop trying to kill them).

And who knows If rockstar will ever fix it. Probably not cause they aren’t problems that help players make gold bars (long as the game is too frustrating to pla they don’t care. Only if it is too easy to make money do they care and they patch that shit up quick).

Sure, I can get camps more often but now there is never any animals which kills what I like doing most in Red Dead (and I loved trader for giving me reason to go hunting). And the game crashes more... and if I want to change servers I have to quit the game and start over because otherwise it just hangs when I change servers. And overall it just has way more frustrating bugs than Fallout 76 (and for me it crashes more than 76)!!!! And when some one who can tolerate Bethesda's jank actually quits your game cause it is frustrating her too much, that says something. Sure, RDR runs better than Bethesda games, but the bugs get in the way of my gameplay far more often and more annoying ways and I have no faith in Rockstar to fix it as they never address it and in general only fix stuff that makes it ""too easy"" to make money. At least Bethesda tries to fix the major problems people point out (and if they can't do it right away they let you know they've heard you unlike Rockstar where you have to guess if they even know people are complaining about it)"

TalesFromRetail,fdh876d,t3_el4ipw,1578417479.0,"So, a little backstory first... I had a regular customer who always would treat you like dirt and only talk to you when she had to. It was very obvious she felt we were peons to cater to her and not actual people. Anyways, she always bought fancy feast (a canned cat food) neatly organized in a box but would always proclaim ""I don't want the box!"" in a very snotty/demanding voice. I would only remember her uniquely when she would tell me she didn't want the box (I have no memory for people and I'm more likely to remember you if I like you, which I didn't like her).

Anyways, I suspect this was the same customer (but really have no proof other than after this incident I never saw that customer again... so tbf she was true to her word). She came through my line this time talking on the phone. And it was very obvious she would get pissed at you if you tried to interrupt her. So I'm left guessing on how she wants her things bagged (and as I said, I don't remember her until she tells me no box). They are neatly organized in a box and I usually assume people who take the time to neatly organize their cans want them to stay organized so I try to put the whole box in and keep the cans in place. A few fall down and I fix that.

Anyways, she's on the phone talking to her friend and trying to use our pin machine. I hear her get pissed off... ""Ugh, I hate these machines (too many questions). And the cashier is so stupid (something about how I bagged her items and how I should know how they should be bagged). I can't go to (the opposition) cause they're too expensive"". Me thinking first of all if I really hated a place I'd just spend extra to go somewhere else. But it was very obvious she wanted me to hear her call me stupid in a way that I couldn't retort (also that she knew I wouldn't retort cause I'm at my job and I have to kiss her ass to keep it).

I usually am good at holding my mouth. I'm known for good customer service. I knew I could get written up for it but I decided it was worth it. When she hung up, I pleasantly told her, ""You could always shop at Walmart"" (which honestly if she hates us I'm doing her a favor cause Walmart probably is cheaper than us). But she got the fuck you implication full well (remember she was counting on me not being able to retort, she knew that was my retort).

So yeah, queu her getting very pissed, tell me she would do that (yes, please, that's why I suggested it!) and going to my coworker to complain to the management. Who didn't write me up but told me not to do that. And... to her credit, if she is the customer I suspect she is, she was truthful about never coming back (and I'm very happy about that). Totally worth it."

But if a game has me feeling it's unfair a lot and just angers me, I'm putting it down... not playing it more. I play a game to have fun, not to make me feel down because I lost unfairly.

&#x200B;

I mean it would be one thing if you argued that's just part of the game and you hvae to find a strategy around it.. but you're arguing that it's good game design to have an unfair game that angers you. And I am pointing out games are supposed to be fun, not something that makes you feel so frustrated you are angry (especially if it's cause the game is being unfair). Game does that, it's not a good game and it's better to go find one that is enjoyable to play (It's one thing to be frustrated cause you aren't doing well, that can be fun. It's another to be frustrated cause you aren't doing well cause the game is balanced badly or makes it easy for other people to cheat. That's just angering and bad game design).

Oh, and some one being able to jump in last minute to steal the gym isn't something you can stratagize against other than to see it's happening and just not bother playing the game... therefore it just feels cheaty. So it falls into the bad type of frustration."

 I wish checks would die already. I really want to yell at the ones who refuse to use debit cause they feel debit is insecure. 1. debit doesn’t give a thief the info they need to withdraw straight from your account. 2. One call and you can cancel the card and that is free. You have to pay to put a stop check on a check or group of checks (and remember what check numbers they are). 3. Many debit cards these days have similar protections as credit cards. Meaning the money isn’t necessarily gone if you report it quick enough. Vs once the check is cashed it’s gone.
