When I was 18 I got away from them and have become a hobby cook. I love complicated flavorful recipes. I would rather die than eat their food again. How someone likes their food is a huge way of how I judge someone. Like if they like well done steaks, can’t handle spicy food, and don’t like their food seasoned, I won’t be around them, because to me that is a character flaw.
