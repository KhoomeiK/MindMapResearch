ProtectAndServe,fdfcq5d,t1_fde50b8,1578358610.0,"""without too much alcohol"" lol.     I agree, we don't all like each other but we definitely all back each other. We need all types to make a great police agency. I  Just turned 20 years on the job, added 4 inches to my waist and 25 pounds. 2 torn rotator cuffs, bad knees & ankles from jogging for 17 years, broken wrist, 3 car crashes during pursuits, broken ankle, broken foot, countless bruises and days off with minor injuries for just doing my job, majort attack and quintuple bypass in March 2017 (99% blocked), and came back to the job August same year. I'm no longer the fit - gel haired -  swat swank kid who thought saving the world was possible. I am now the slightly overweight detective who still loves his job and whose exercise is low impact battle ropes and climbing stairs. My point being 1. Do anything (better then doing nothing)  2. Keep training.  3. Learn from each other.   4. Be safe always.  And most of all between marriages ( all cops are required to have 1 divorce) don't turn to fast food and alcohol... watch your stress and your sodium intake. God Bless."
