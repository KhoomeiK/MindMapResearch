Unfortunately, that's not possible when the accounts are current so their best bet is probably stay in the house, the mortgage isn't the problem, but let those cards to into arrears by 90+ days. Then either negotiate directly with the issuers, or use a third party non-profit credit counselor, to negotiate a settlement.

You must have done a 7 year loan to get your payment that low.  Best strategy at this point is accelerate it, so you minimize the amount of interest paid. $1000 a month should get you nearly paid off in two years. In the future, 18% loans are NOT what you want to use to build credit. Get a Mastercard or Visa, or a store card, and pay the balance in full each month. For the car, until you build sufficient credit, you should have just saved up your first $5k and then bought simple basic transportation. As things stand now, if you don't accelerate, you'll be paying the equivalent of a decent used car in interest in just the first 18 months of the loan."

financialindependence,fcffhzo,t1_fc5whj3,1577629454.0,"Remember that bonds, particularly long duration ones, carry risk. A 10 year treasury can lose 60% of its face value very quickly if rates soar and could lose 95% of face value if we get a severe budget impasse like 2013 and the U.S. defaults on a payment or two. If you really want a safe instrument for 5 years worth of expenses, you need to have that money in CD's and cash. Similar to a stock crash, a major crisis in bonds won't be obvious until it is upon us and then it will be too late. And it might occur concurrently with an 80% drop in equities.

financialindependence,fcfavgy,t3_egdoxu,1577628180.0,"The failure case of the 4% is actually very difficult to see, because the success of that formula is based on historical periods that include dramatic sustained drops in the market. It is intentionally low because the strategy is designed to survive great recessions and depressions. So if you start with a 4% draw rate, inflation adjusted, and the market nosedives a naive approach would be ""Oh this failed. I need to drop back to 2%"". No, not really. The reason you chose that 4% in the first place, instead of 6% or even the 8% that was popular advice in the 1980's, is that you are intentionally drawing out less than a normal market returns to handle periods of extreme volatility. So unless the world is literally ending, you can sustain that draw rate, and adjust for inflation, with fairly good confidence that your money won't run out. Importantly, it's not 4% of your assets each year. It is 4% of the \*original\* assets, with an inflation adjustment."
