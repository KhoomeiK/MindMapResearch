Grobbulus,ffclax1,t1_ffchlyd,1579801879.0,"Right on, I can deal with that answer."
Grobbulus,ffcgtnz,t1_ffcbgk3,1579799156.0,"But bro, a *white* weapon?? I've honestly never even seen that past like level 15 (give or take 2)."
norfolk,ff6mw65,t1_ff6ii0y,1579630597.0,Has anybody ever told you that your jokes aren't funny?
norfolk,ff6i41k,t1_ff6dxv6,1579627686.0,"I've noticed the only people that say Hampton Roads doesn't have stuff to do are the people that don't try to find anything to do. This area has plenty of fun around, so start looking or stop complaining."
aww,ff245zi,t1_ff22puj,1579493314.0,Irrelevant and inherently judgmental for just no reason.
nextfuckinglevel,ff1awo3,t1_ff18rgu,1579476931.0,"I use those too! And now if I ever somehow forget them when going to a show, I can almost *feel* my ears crying."
nextfuckinglevel,fezmo86,t3_eqx76k,1579459067.0,Lol people here crying about hearing damage but can't possibly fathom the possibility that he's wearing ear plugs.
EDM,fev6rif,t1_feu4uge,1579393769.0,"Dude your set was fuckin great, man. And this clip is so gold."
EDM,fev6m6r,t1_feusxry,1579393705.0,Lol they recently put up signs that say no hanging from the rafters.
GoodDudes,felp6zd,t1_fekx07q,1579227566.0,"Boom. That's the huge key in situations like this. Shooting your shot can be really tough to finally do, but if you're an adult and can process emotions, it gives a huge amount of closure if it ends up not working in your favor."
classicwow,fekxbi6,t1_fekki5u,1579209532.0,"Attaining rank 12 this early absolutely takes effort. Yes he's using bots, but that's while they're at work or afk for whatever reason. They are absolutely doing world pvp on their own, which requires effort. And either way it's still time, which in itself is worth a lot, effort or not."
classicwow,fek9a8t,t1_fek3ojl,1579195277.0,"Lol no, they'll just alter the botting scripts."
classicwow,fek96kz,t1_fek5qcp,1579195217.0,Reminds me of the episode of Cops where the woman says another person stole her money that she was trying to buy crack with.
classicwow,fek91vs,t1_fek6ebh,1579195140.0,"I'd be pretty god damn pissed to only have half of my epic pvp gear. Some people stop at 13, but nobody stops at 12 and says ""eh, that's plenty."""
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdwxydv,t1_fdwp818,1578763350.0,That dudes middle name is Pedantic.
nextfuckinglevel,fdnt1x7,t1_fdnlnvg,1578592260.0,"I think he was trying to showboat a little bit. Like ""haha check this out, I can just walk it in here no problem!"""
classicwow,fdc7x4c,t1_fdc5emx,1578268848.0,"Yeah okay, but you're saying that you're upset about (basically) winning every single AV because you have a 30 minute queue. And that's what I'm referring to when I say: lol wut"
classicwow,fdbel40,t1_fdb3zs4,1578256618.0,Hold up. Horde are crying about the state of AV currently? Hahahaha
norfolk,fcunja0,t1_fculxro,1577984789.0,"Thanks for the clarification, not sure how I missed that part. Also not sure why I got downvoted lol. Reddit is fun."
norfolk,fcul0r8,t3_eizpi3,1577983343.0,"Seems to only be veterans that receive disability from the VA, which I thought were already allowed access. Maybe it was more restrictive before or maybe I misread the article."
electronicmusic,fcsutu4,t3_einwjr,1577925669.0,Their sets are some of the best experiences you can get. They really do an amazing job setting the mood throughout the entire crowd. Everybody is so open and warm and accepting. My favorite bit is the messages they type up on the screen. I'll always remember the first time I saw them.
nextfuckinglevel,fcmu3uj,t1_fcm19fn,1577792343.0,"Going through school, a good fellow coined the term JOPO. Jack off, pass out."
blunderyears,fcmsx4h,t3_ehzdub,1577790687.0,I've honestly never laughed harder at one of these photos. This is perfection.
nevertellmetheodds,fcbrv0x,t1_fcblrge,1577590274.0,"Depends what you consider favorable. In my view, anything that you cannot directly affect is entirely chaos."
aww,fcawyhu,t1_fcau43x,1577578251.0,"I just so happen to have adopted a lovely Mackerel Tabby a few months ago, which is when I was taught!"
nevertellmetheodds,fcawmdy,t1_fcarrdb,1577578064.0,Not if you don't believe in luck.
aww,fcajhq1,t1_fcac5gj,1577570375.0,"That would be a Mackerel Tabby! If you look up pictures of a Mackerel fish, it'll make perfect sense ;)"
EDM,fcajad6,t3_egt9ct,1577570257.0,"Hell of lot better video than all the stuff my friends have been posting to snapchat/instagram! Thanks for the upload, homie. 

Pretty sad to be missing that lineup but I already had tickets for Eric Prydz in NYC for tomorrow, so no real complaints haha"
HumansBeingBros,fc6mm87,t1_fc60iyy,1577484164.0,I had the same question and now I'm upset that I know the answer. Fuck.
deadmau5,fbm6pt4,t3_edxmjb,1576979346.0,"Arguru has long been my favorite song of his. It just has a way of making me instantly feel invigorated and happy. Him ending with this felt so perfect. There are songs of his that have more emotional pull on me, but this one just left feeling profoundly content with the entire night. So fucking good."
