TaylorSwift,ffng82y,t1_ffnfyhs,1580065514.0,Because it sucks (in my opinion)
TaylorSwift,ffnff73,t1_ffnetmr,1580065294.0,"It seems that ‘Amazon’ is selling these ones for their original or similar prices:

And the other ones are sold by other sellers on there or is fulfilled by ‘Amazon’, but is more expensive than their original prices:

TaylorSwift,ffn9ar5,t1_ffn9189,1580063355.0,The way I referred to them isn’t “gross”. I don’t like their attitudes. It would be gross if I talked about their bodies the way lots of men do. That’s what is “gross”. Taylor has experienced it.
TaylorSwift,ffmxlc9,t1_ffma028,1580059943.0,I do hate rap music. I’d say the same thing about male rappers but I don’t know who many of them are. One positive is it seems female rappers are getting more of the spotlight. I don’t want to know who the males are anyways lol
TaylorSwift,ffkmpbg,t1_ffkmjcp,1580025296.0,"She’s greedy.

I have to like the people and who they are as a person first if I’m to genuinely like them as an artist. So Cardi and Nicki are a BIG no."
TaylorSwift,ffkm221,t1_ffkim7e,1580024996.0,"If I’m being honest, I can’t stand her, her attitude, the way she talks, and her crap music. I hope Taylor wouldn’t stoop to her level. I feel the same way about Nicki Minaj. They’re both self-entitled mouthy b#ches with huge egos honestly."
TaylorSwift,ffkbqi5,t3_eu21dh,1580020174.0,Eww. I pray they don’t collaborate.

TaylorSwift,ffk9c3v,t1_ffk292u,1580019093.0,"That’s interesting, it looks like it has the other single vinyl records sold on there too."
TaylorSwift,ffk04dj,t3_eu1vjf,1580011758.0,"There seems to be extra copies available on 'Target' if anyone is interested. The other vinyl records seemed to have sold out in pre-orders and they said to check back when they're released if there's more. And it says ""NOT SOLD IN STORES"" so it has to be bought online if you want one.

**EDIT:** It may appear that there are very limited quantities. When I try to add some to my cart the maximum is 7 (not 10 like usual) so there might only be 7 left."
TaylorSwift,ffjzzs4,t3_eu1vjf,1580011650.0,I had 4 ordered from 'Target' but they were sent to my American address so I won't get to see what they look like for a while. I wondered if anyone got theirs and knew if this was the official cover now. It's the image used on the 'Target' website and for other websites now.
TaylorSwift,ffjzhfh,t3_etywr4,1580011236.0,That’s interesting. I listen to that channel sometimes in the car. I wish I could’ve heard that song on the radio for the first time.
TaylorSwift,ffjzeow,t3_etyxdq,1580011176.0,I think most of them are real. If they don’t look really perfect they’re usually real but there could be some who try to fake it. But a lot of times it’s easy to tell which ones are fake. You should post links to ones and we could give opinions on them.
cats,ffjuht3,t3_eu119v,1580007294.0,What a cutie
InstacartShoppers,ffj9vrx,t1_ffj6y7d,1579993836.0,"I have I think one 1 star, one 2 stars, two 4 stars, and the rest are 5 stars (31). But the 1 star was removed as the lowest one apparently. Who knows why they’d give those stars. People are never satisfied lol."
TaylorSwift,ffj9nl7,t1_ffj5o4w,1579993690.0,"I know about that one, I think there was 350 of them. But I sort of don’t consider that one as part of the lithographs since it was a “print”...It was ridiculously priced too. They never sold all of them which is funny honestly. I know there’s one on ‘eBay’ or was one recently but it’s RIDICULOUS going for $2,500 USD or something. I really wish I could’ve gotten it when it was on the online store but I could definitely could not afford it when I was younger then. Maybe now if I saved up.

That’s probably the rarest one out of all the signed and framed things...Especially when they were numbered and there were only 350. I wonder how many were sold for the other signed and framed lithographs."
TaylorSwift,ffivka2,t1_fficatm,1579983747.0,You should’ve donated it to me!!!!
InstacartShoppers,ffhguxu,t3_etje6b,1579934667.0,Never heard of this before. I’ve only been given a cash tip twice and that was on top of a regular tip in the app.
InstacartShoppers,ffhgtdt,t1_ffgso12,1579934617.0,That’s unfortunately the truth most times.
InstacartShoppers,ffhgkab,t3_etgo30,1579934311.0,"I had to get a pregnancy test for an order with other stuff and I wasn’t too embarrassed, but I went through the self-checkout so that made it better."
TaylorSwift,ffhg5zq,t1_ffh89e1,1579933842.0,"I love looking at merch photos and stuff like that, and I do collect Taylor merch - all kinds, not just autographs. I’ve never had my life together it seems like because I’ve always wanted to organize my stuff and take pictures of my merch, but my stuff is just so disorganized. Maybe sometime in the future. Hopefully.

My number of Taylor autographs aren’t huge by any means but I am lucky to have what I have. I can’t believe what people try to sell the signed and framed lithographs for. I’ve gotten into looking at and buying autographs more recently and have had a few good finds of Taylor autographs on reselling websites that were decent prices last year and this year. And other artists too like Kacey Musgraves. I have all of her (3) CD booklets signed! She’s easier for getting ahold of her albums signed for good prices than Taylor is

I love the thrill of the hunt and of great finds and deals lol. Either online on re-selling websites or in stores. That goes with anything - Taylor merch or clothes or shoes or whatever."
InstacartShoppers,ffhg2j0,t3_etn9vi,1579933727.0,FINALLY I get my first comment and all it says is “Thanks”.
TaylorSwift,ffh86p8,t1_ffh7a7d,1579925872.0,I think I remember seeing it once before but yeah it is rare. I wish I had one.
TaylorSwift,ffh73od,t1_ffh6k2e,1579924960.0,"I meant in terms of lithographs (framed and signed).

I haven’t seen those before of what you’re talking about."
TaylorSwift,ffh42od,t3_etle18,1579922554.0,"I was just thinking about this and I think by looking online lots at reselling websites, the 'Mean' signed and framed lithograph seems to be one of the rarest ones out of the ones that have been sold on the online Taylor store in the past. I don't see it being sold very often. I see the 'Speak Now', 'RED', '1989 Tour', and sometimes the nine photos lithographs being sold.

I often forget a lot about all of the different signed lithographs there is. I'm lucky to have just about all of them. There's at least 5 since the 'Speak Now' era."
