It wasn't an article that said ""Warren claims Sanders doesn't think a woman can be president."" So it's a smear, but it's a third-hand smear.

Since it was off the record, we will most likely never know what was said verbatim beyond the shadow of a doubt, but nothing I've seen from Sanders positions him as sexist in the slightest, especially since he's said for years that a woman could be president.

Sanders immediately said that was a huge mischaracterization of the conversation, where he said that Trump would likely use any means necessary to defeat the Democratic nominee, including racism and sexism. Warren initially refused to comment on it, but since then has doubled down on what her camp leaked, essentially saying ""he said a woman couldn't be president, and I disagreed."" 

Since then, numerous clips have surfaced from the 80's showing Sanders say that a woman could, and should, be president. He also wrote in his 2017 book that he had urged Warren to run against Clinton in 2016, but she didn't.

Medicare is a complete insurance scheme for Americans over 65. It's extremely popular, has a wide net of coverage, and very generous plans. The biggest distinction? It's federal, meaning that while states can opt into additional funding (often called Medicare Expansion), the bulk of the budget comes from our national budget, making it far more stable and ensuring a more universal level of coverage.

In that way, I'd say CNN is the most neoliberal corporation, because their ideals – such as they have any at all – are completely dictated by critical mass in the social market. But they DO take stances where it's a perceived forgone conclusion or threatens their interests directly, like with regards to defending capitalist status quo or attacking Sanders, who threatens their management class, c-suite, and board."

Heavy hitters like Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Susan Collins, and Mitch McConnell all voted ""Yea"" on it. [Source](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2002/s145)

This is a literal planned invasion and military strike against the Hague and the Netherlands should any American Citizen, Servicemember, or Official be indicted for any war crimes or international crimes. It also includes provisions for withdrawing all military support for any country that ratifies any ICC action against the US, and vows that the US will withdraw from any UN peacekeeping unless it gets full immunity. Remember, this is all aimed at countries who have been our allies for hundreds of years.

Essentially, it boils down to saying ""if we aren't completely above international law, there is no international law. And if you disagree, we'll fucking kill you."" It also all-but-ensures Trump will never face any international repercussions for war crimes."

politics,fehb3p2,t3_ep46f7,1579112902.0,"After CNN saw how much money Fox News was raking in circa early 2010s, they wanted a piece of that pie. So they became determined to become the centrist, neoliberal version of Fox News: create a comfortable, alternate reality based on fear and anger for a small segment of the older population.

They are essentially now Fox News, just 2 degrees to the left. Most corporate news organizations are not far behind, because people are a lot more likely to become steady viewers if you can get to a place of becoming the stand-in for *the way they should think*.

People call these ""bubbles,"" where nothing challenges your preconceived notions, but I think they're more like filters: kind of like closing one eye and then the other while wearing those old 3D glasses. One paints your entire world red, the other makes everything blue. The world is chaotic, weird and scary things happen – it's rarely logical and it's often distressing. And it's really taxing to draw your own conclusions from that chaos, to find meaning in something that, at the highest levels, really has no inherent meaning.

These news corporations know that what people are really looking for is someone to come in and do the heavy lifting for them. Reassure them, even if it's in the direction of anxiety and paranoia. ""There's a story here, this all is happening for a reason."" Become their filter, tell them how events fit into your red or blue world.

You can also see how this is massively valuable to advertisers: an audience primed to be told how to think and what to do? JACKPOT.

The money for media organizations is not in reporting the news in an unbiased way, it's formulating opinions for viewers. Because then viewers become addicted. Thinking? YUCK! CNN does the thinking for me. Fox News tells things the way they *really* are!"
entertainment,fehal10,t1_fegnqct,1579112595.0,"It's a difficult issue, because on the one hand, most of the worlds' tax systems are so incredibly complex and shoddily built from piecemeal legislation that there are gaping loopholes that wealthy individuals and corporations can easily take advantage of.

On the other hand, these corporations and wealthy individuals are almost always involved in the legislation that alters this system, so they can easily steer lawmakers in a direction that preserves loopholes or creates new ones. 

So in essence, sure there are probably some entities purely taking advantage of the system as it stands, but you CAN absolutely blame these actors for this, because they helped create the system in the first place and are definitely heavily invested in keeping these loopholes open and opposing any and all attempts to seriously overhaul the system."
