Half of it would spoil before reaching a mouth, and I don't want to imagine the inefficiency of shipping *water* to a drought region."

collapse,fgkkj40,t1_fgkk13i,1580867694.0,"Because we still have the tests from back then, and scientists use them as part of establishing a control for modern scoring methods. People from today, who fit today's average score, will score above average on an earlier test.

That said, people really mistake the utility of IQ as a measure. It's a really flat metric besides when used to screen for significant mental impairment."
unpopularopinion,fgkk6fr,t1_fgkjhtm,1580867461.0,"Your question was nebulous and anecdotal, and the continued comment was of poor grammatical structure.

I can't tell you why *you* haven't seen something. I can only guess why it *night not be generally present*.

I guessed that, you don't see people trying to cancel them because the general online community prefers to showcase and mock things rather than to erase them."
collapse,fgkjvb1,t1_fgkj84y,1580867254.0,"As far as abstract cognitive improvements go, we're still improving our collective IQ every few years. They have to continually adjust the tests so that 100 reflects the population average. As an example, for the ability to conceptualize hypotheticals:

""...Alexander Luria discovered when he tested rural Russian peasants in the 1930s. He discovered that pre-scientific people can't take the hypothetical seriously. That is, if you pose to them questions like, ""There is snow at the North Pole; where there is snow, bears are white; what color are bears at the North Pole?"" they would say, ""Well, I've only seen brown bears. And only if a person came from the North Pole with testimony would I believe that the bears there are white."""

unpopularopinion,fgkisn9,t1_fgkdv4m,1580866537.0,"This speaks more to developing wealth gaps rather than racial differences. If you haven't noticed, America is splitting into a two-class system, with half of all current employment being low wage service sector jobs.

unpopularopinion,fgkhqx0,t1_fgj5o10,1580865847.0,"Because there's an entire sub dedicated to mocking them, r/inceltears.

It's easier to mock content than to cancel it. The hard bit is where the content in question is dedicated to mocking other content.

I feel if people want to hop into a hateful circlejerk, then let them."
unpopularopinion,fgkhh6z,t1_fgjx26e,1580865669.0,"I try to stay apolitical, or when making a political comment, I phrase it from a moderate standpoint or phrase gently.

I find conversations are a lot easier when I focus on the *how* as much as the *what* of what I say."
