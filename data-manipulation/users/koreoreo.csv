poledancing,ffiuzwl,t1_ffhrgfx,1579983385.0,The studio is more geared towards people looking to compete. I'm still here because I bought a 10-class pack and currently only have time to go once a week. Definitely checking out other places soon. Thanks :)
poledancing,ffhp695,t3_etm6jt,1579946473.0,"JUST DO IT!! Signing up for an impromptu pole class was my best decision of 2019. My only regret is not starting sooner. Pole alone won't make you lose weight without a healthy diet, but any exercise is always better than none, if not for your weight loss goals then for your health :) I'd recommend wearing as little clothing as you're comfortable with, maybe a little less! Pole is super non-judgmental."
poledancing,ffea0zd,t1_ffdwy11,1579840861.0,"Thanks for asking and educating yourself about this, I agree you shouldn't be downvoted. The unfortunate truth is that a huge part of being a woman is needing to constantly defend yourself against harassment and unwanted advances for the sake of your safety, pride, and dignity. Please forgive us next time you're treated with aggression and try to be considerate of the things we go through on a daily basis!"
poledancing,ff8ci50,t3_es7j4p,1579672905.0,"Not weird at all! When I started taking classes I went with friends, one of whom is male. Unfortunately a lot of studios can be picky about allowing men to take classes. I've seen places that are freely co-ed, places that only offer one co-ed session per week (sometimes less), and places that don't allow men at all. If you can find a studio that isn't this strict, absolutely go for it. The fact that you're even considering these issues mean you're most likely a decent person, so you should have nothing to worry about!"
fatlogic,fes3i1q,t1_fes1j7f,1579360983.0,"True, but also keep in mind satiety and how junk food can contribute to overeating because of not being nutritious enough to satisfy needs, triggering addictive responses, and simply being very calorie dense and not very filling."
poledancing,fep28wj,t3_epkdo2,1579310508.0,"You can't lose weight through exercise alone. I have terrible upper body strength, too, and honestly it's more that I've been working on my strength to get better at pole rather than pole making me stronger. It's definitely a lot of fun, but I've seen a lot of people get discouraged if they aren't progressing as fast as they hoped or lose interest when they hit a wall.."
fatlogic,feloukx,t1_fell62s,1579227329.0,It hurts my throat too! A lot of things with too much sugar do this to me :/ at least it stops me from overindulgence
TwoXChromosomes,fe75p6c,t3_enxqdk,1578910396.0,"What shocked me the most when I learned about abortion in detail last year was that there are so many anti-abortion organizations that disguise themselves as pro-choice, just to scare women away with exaggerated and often false information. And so much pro-choice material online is ALSO heavily biased against abortions. 

Even worse is that the gruesome realities of pregnancy are so often censored. Nobody talks about the dangers of pregnancy and the possible lifelong side effects..you only see talk of physical and emotional pain, regret, guilt, and risks (risks that for medically safe procedures are STILL MUCH LOWER than the risks of pregnancy/childbirth). 

Women are really being misled and misinformed, and even when we think we've done our research it's sick that we can still be so misguided by lies about our own bodies. Much like the results reported, all the females I know who have been through an abortion also felt nothing but relief. Having a child is so much more than just the physical toll, it's a body-changing, life-altering, permanent change that you're stuck with forever. No child deserves the misery of being unwanted, in any case."
Korean,fe3ka12,t3_enm6ba,1578850055.0,"I'm not an ex-native speaker but I am a first-generation Korean American who was raised in an English-speaking household. I picked up enough from family and general exposure that I'd say I learned quicker than a non-Korean might have when I decided to start learning Korean a few years ago, but I can relate to you having a hard time finding the right level of learning. I actually started learning in a classroom setting, so I struggle more with sounding natural in conversation, as my class stressed writing and speaking properly... my Korean friends make fun of me for sounding too proper at times.

I agree with everyone else, the more you can expose yourself to Korean speaking/listening/writing opportunities, the better, and additionally I'd recommend skimming through lessons even if they seem too easy. Eventually you'll come across a topic worth looking at. Sorry I don't have any real advice!"

AskReddit,fcxc519,t1_fcxc0na,1578058860.0,"That's the point. People think shaving hairs, such as arms/legs or facial hair, makes them grow back thicker, which is usually undesirable in the first case and desired in the second. Of course, this is false, and the blunt tip is just what makes a hair appear thicker"

xxfitness,fcwi241,t3_ej3ryy,1578026180.0,"IMO you can want to better yourself and your health/fitness/body having any focus on your appearance at all! I know it's not the case for all people but I always make my fitness goals goals of action. Doing a pull-up (maybe someday..), accomplishing a new aerial trick, setting a new benchpress PR, whatever it may be. For me, focusing on things that I can do and watching myself improve is the only thing that can motivate me... and my body changes come as a side effect. I think my history of lightly disordered eating and body dysmorphia is a big part of why this works best for me."

Going into meeting someone with the intention of dating from either end makes it really uncomfortable and unnatural feeling IMO.. I don't have any friends I'd want to date, though, so I'll probably resort to trying again in a year or two. 4 years of failed dates has me burnt out for now"
menstrualcups,fcubsvh,t3_eik5b3,1577977300.0,"It's so great that you get to start with a cup so young! I'm in my 20s and didn't find out about cups until 3 years ago. They really changed my life for the better. Everyone else has offered great tips for you, so I wish you good luck with your first few tries! Sometimes it takes a cycle or two to get used to a new cup, don't give up if things don't go perfectly smoothly at first!"
Dance,fctsalb,t3_eiuvf2,1577956885.0,"I haven't actually taken a heels class but I've done some choreo in heels here and there.. The pair I've been using is actually just a sandal type of block heel, about 3 inches. I've found the height comfortable, and sometimes I'll wrap a sweatband around the arch of my foot for some extra stability. I suppose that's not too helpful, but maybe you have a similar pair somewhere you can modify? You can also buy straps specifically made for holding a pump or mule on your foot. Personally when I eventually get around to taking a class I'm looking for a pair of heels with more structure/foot coverage, and probably adjustable in some way so I can tighten them if they loosen with use. I'd also look for a height around 3 inches, and perhaps a narrower heel just for looks since I think I put my weight on my toes pretty well.  
I hope that helps in some way!"
