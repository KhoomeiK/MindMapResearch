Xcom,fgt7vuh,t1_fgt63a7,1581100630.0,"Compared to Steam and GOG, yes it is. I have Epic Game Store installed (mostly because they give out free games) and it is incredibly frustrating to use. First off it's really slow, loading any new screen takes several seconds. Secondly the store is incredibly light on features such as a cart so you have to buy every item individually. Once you've got the games the installer and launcher mostly works (although it is very slow) but the cloud storage seems to be pretty buggy, about half the time it doesn't auto upload so you have to manually upload before launching the game.

I'm not one of those people who say ""never buy on EGS"" but the store does not go out of it's way to make me want to use it. I'd only ever use it to buy an exclusive game and it would have to be one I really, really want. Steam and GOG are just much more convenient and easy to use. As an example, I got Terraforming Mars for free on EGS and liked it enough that I decided to buy the DLC. However I also decided it was worth spending a little extra money (like $5 more) to buy the game and DLC collection on Steam rather than just buy the DLC on EGS.

IMHO Epic needs to take some of the money they are spending on exclusives and invest it into improving their storefront. Right now the only reason to buy on thier store is for the exclusives. Sure they can get some business with exclusives but without improvements to the storefront that's all they're going to get and it's not a sustainable business model."

Xcom,fgqtn36,t1_fgqrl4c,1581031246.0,"Ok, here's something that might work. There's a console command that enables all region links.

Go to XCOM2's launch options and add in the line ""-allowconsole -log -autodebug"" without quotation marks. Once you're done, you can open the console from in-game using the tilde (~) key. The console command is then ShowAllRegionLinks.

Sorry I haven't tested it myself but I found someone referencing it in a mod so it's worth a shot.

EDIT: You may also be able to force the region to join your resistance. There's a console command that can change a regions level.

The format would be: ""setregionreslevel WorldRegion_SouthSA x""  where x is an integer. Unfortunately the only documented value I can find is 3 to give it a radio tower. It might be worth trying other integers to see if one of those just auto contacts the region.

By Default New Chile has three connections: New Brazil, New Australia and South Africa.

That being said, there are several perks which have a pretty noticeable impact. Thorns drastically reduces the danger of swarmers since they can only attack you once. Deep Pockets and being able to carry 55 minerals is a huge time saver. Field Medic can save a run if a teammate goes down.

Xcom,fgjmz79,t1_fgjk5an,1580847366.0,"So there's an interesting bug regarding save scumming and the random number generator. When you load a save game the random number generator is reset to the same point in it's sequence each time but the point that it's set to isn't actually the same point it was at when you made the save. So if you: save the game, take a shot, load the game and take the same shot you can actually get a different result although repeatedly loading the game will always give you the same result.

Xcom,fgjhye2,t3_eyt2cj,1580844423.0,"So this is probably going to be considered heresy by a lot of people, but don't be afraid to save scum. However, don't simply save scum to try and make the RNG get in your favor, use save scumming to try different approaches to an engagement. A large part of the tactical game is considering the best action order for your troops to setup openings as well as predicting what the enemy AI is going to do. Replaying a few turns and trying different approaches to the same engagement can help you get a better feel for how different approaches can influence the course of an engagement.

In terms of general strategy. Getting the Guerrilla Tactics School should be a priority so that you can get the squad size upgrade as soon as one of your soldiers reaches Sargent rank. The squad size upgrades are some of the largest power boosts in the game.

For tactical strategy, be very liberal in your usage of grenades. Besides doing guaranteed damage destroying cover to open an enemy up for a flanking shot can really help with early game accuracy.

Additionally, target prioritization isn't always obvious so it can be worth thinking about. For example, Sectoids tend to favor using their psionic powers over attacking. So unless they are actively mind controlling one of your soldiers it's often best to ignore them and focus on their accompanying troopers."

It makes the game more difficult for two reasons. The first issue is that interrogating enemies reduces your research times so you'll get your upgraded weapons and armor later in the game (although grabbing a sectoid with your mandatory capture can help here). The second related issue is related to research order for plasma weapons. In order to research plasma weapons you need to capture one to unlock the first piece of research. An Outsider will give you a Light Plasma Rifle which means you'll have to start with that research which significantly delays getting Plasma weapons for your Assaults, Snipers and Gunners (since you have to research both Light and Regular Plasma Rifles first).

That being said, the second issues can be averted with just one more capture by grabbing a Muton in June or later (Muton's appear in May but only have Light Plasma Rifles). That would allow you to skip LPRs and get you the research reduction for plasma weapons."

Rough math. Rinks generally don't stock half sizes so you're stocking say 24 sizes total (8 each for men/women/kids). You probably don't stock the same number of each size since shoe sizes tend towards a polynomial distribution. But you do need extras of the kids skates for when you host large kids groups (like school/camp field trips). So say an average of 12 each for the kids skates and average 6 each for the adult sizes (with the middle sizes having more and the large/small sizes having fewer). That would put you at 192 pairs.

Xcom,ffxasso,t3_evprn2,1580321331.0,"I think it's definitely a factor. Look at it this way, 6 soldiers have 50% more firepower than 4 soldiers. By comparison plasma weapons have about 50% more firepower than lasers. So running with only 4 soldiers is similar to running with 6 soldiers but not using plasma weapons. Obviously it's not a perfect analogy since the 4 soldiers are also losing out on action economy and charge based abilities as well but it gives a rough analogy for power level."

SurvivingMars,ffx6quq,t1_ffwpyuz,1580318921.0,They do use more power at maximum range but not by enough to really matter. About the only time I use one less than max range is if I'm in a situation where only one scrubber is needed in an area. In which case it can be worth putting a second scrubber with minimum range next to it just to clean the main scrubber.
SurvivingMars,ffx6llh,t1_ffwszgh,1580318835.0,That's why I use mods to both show max range while building and automatically set them to max once built.

SurvivingMars,ffvom3q,t1_ffvfafn,1580269073.0,In addition don't forget to set your scrubbers to max range and overlap them so they clean each other. You can get mods that will automatically set your scrubbers to max range and show the max range when building.
antiMLM,ffuubl8,t1_ffuqjrn,1580249482.0,"Personally I doubt it would make much difference, and might even make things worse. UBI (at least as most people talk about it) is intended to supplement an income from a job, not to be your sole income. So while it will definitely make it financially easier for people to be SAHM (or similar) there will still be plenty of people who are looking for extra income.

As for why it might make it worse, I can totally imagine huns using UBI in their pitches and encouraging people to ""invest"" their UBI in an MLM: ""For just a quarter of one month's UBI check you too can become an independent reseller on the path to financial freedom""."
AskReddit,ffumnxw,t3_ev5gkp,1580245190.0,"I'm an agnostic (specifically an apathetic agnostic) as opposed to an atheist but I'll add on my opinion. There's no clear evidence of the existence of any sort of supernatural deity or afterlife so I see no real reason to spend time trying to placate a deity who may or may not exist and may or may not even care how I act. The sensible option is to live my life according to my moral code, that way if there isn't an afterlife then people will (hopefully) think well of me after my death and if there is an afterlife then whatever happens I can hold my head up high and say ""I did what I felt was right"". That's why I use the term ""apathetic agnostic"" since my view essentially boils down to the idea that in the absence of proof the existence or non-existence of god is irrelevant to how I live my life.

The reason I consider myself an agnostic as opposed to an atheist also comes down to a lack of proof. You can't really prove that god doesn't exist any more than you can prove that he does exist. So while I tend to lean towards the view that there is probably no god or afterlife I consider it illogical to state that it's definitively the case.

Of course it's also possible that the entire world is actually a computer simulation being run by a grad student to study my specific life and that once I die the simulation will be shut down and the servers repurposed for a study of flident migration patterns. You can't really prove or disprove that either."
AskScienceFiction,ffu462a,t3_eue659,1580234110.0,"In general most ""planet destroyer"" type superweapons are useless. Habitable planets are a valuable resource so destroying one is pretty wasteful. Ideally you want a superweapon that can kill your enemies while leaving their infrastructure and biosphere intact.

Bioweapons are the obvious choice here but they are hard to tailor, if they are to fast then a quarantine may be effective for stopping the spread. Conversely if they are to slow then there is a chance that someone will find a cure before it runs its course."

Yeah, I've got that bug as well, I haven't gotten a popup for quite a few crates now. It happened to me at about the same time as I got the last skin IIRC so the bug might be related to that.

I still get the new victory poses, I just don't get the popup."
