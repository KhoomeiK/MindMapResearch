That is horribly over-charged. Hit and run, fine. Reckless driving, sure. ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON? Is his foot a deadly weapon to cars? Is there a recklessness standard for that in Cali?"
todayilearned,ffy4doj,t1_ffxuid1,1580338319.0,"Protestants, really. The Catholic Church has its own observatory, agrees with evolution, and has had many famous scientists in its ranks for centuries. The heliocentric model itself was formed by Copernicus, who happened to be a priest. The Big-Bang was first proposed by a Belgian priest. 

What people point to as evidence of Catholic hatred for science mostly stems from the counter-reformation when protestants used open-mindedness to science as proof of Catholic blasphemy. Galileo's trial is also largely misunderstood."

Define ""slutty."" It means different things to different people. That's the issue. 

>What if you meet your future spouse and have sex with them immediately? And no one else after? And you happen to form a relationship with that person based on, oh you know, OTHER SHIT, like what the majority of people do. 

Then it's good that it worked out, I guess. 

>But unless you're going to actually do something as a social justice warrior, dont preach.  

That's not a good way to look at it either. If it's clear that someone is hurting him or herself, isn't it the right thing to try to help? I'm not talking about yelling at people or offering unwanted advice, but at least having a social knowledge is beneficial.

>Please dont start going off about what you think is ""healthy""... because in the long run it doesnt matter and no one on this sub cares about the actual health of other people that have nothing to do with them.

That seems like a 180 degree turn from earlier in the response. Maybe no one caring about other people isn't a ""good"" way of existing."

CFB,feh77tp,t1_feflv3b,1579110591.0,"Fun fact: many, maybe most, of the New World variants of European languages are actually based on the older variants than what is spoken in Europe today. 

The emigrants from Europe brought their languages as they were spoken when they left Europe. Those languages continued to evolve in Europe, and in some cases, the governments of the European countries literally chose and enforced which variants the people should speak. 

Examples: [New Jersey Italian](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-capicola-became-gabagool-the-italian-new-jersey-accent-explained) is mostly comprised of the old Italian dialects spoken in southern Italy. When the country was unified, it was decreed that the language should be unified. The variant chosen was Tuscan since that's the language Dante wrote in. People who emigrated to the US weren't subject to those decrees (obviously) and so continued with their traditional languages. 


French had a similar thing since the French government tries to control the language through the ministry of culture. 


Spanish, too. My Cuban family went to Spain and were told that they speak like they're acting in an old play. People in Spain adopted the Castilian lisp after many of the colonies were already established and populated, which is why none of them use it (also regional differences, not all regions in Spain lisp). 


Surprising to many Americans, our version of English is actually older than the one in Britain. The British Accent, in all its forms is relatively new, and was started in the early to mid 19th century. People started doing it because it was stylish. George Washington would have sounded more like a modern American (probably slightly Southern) than he would have any Brit.

The New World versions aren't pure, since language evolves anyway, but are usually closer to the old versions of the languages."

Iran could have done much worse, but didn't. Now Iran says it will consider it over if the US doesn't hit back. 


I would not be surprised if this were even coordinated between the US and Iranian governments to reduce tensions, prevent war, and allow the Iranians to look stronger to their people at home so they don't try to overthrow the mullahs (which has been a concern recently, even before the embassy attack). 


It takes pretty good intel to hit a base, let alone two, without killing *any* Americans. US knew this was coming and probably stationed people in protected areas. Clever trick for a good cause. While the US would absolutely destroy Iran, no one wants the kind of instability a government-less Iran would cause."
