frenchhelp,fdbsi15,t1_fdbodrh,1578261292.0,"> « Amener des conséquences » is you were doing something you didn’t know had consequences and now you’ll have to deal with them (I hope my explanation was clear enough but it’s really subtle and there is pretty much no difference it’s more an aesthetic choice) 

So, if I want to say "" L’atteinte de la perfection et la beauté sont un des dangers des réseaux sociaux, qui peut amener des conséquences plus sérieuses "", is it correct to just write ""amener""? (also, should i write ""sont l'un des dangers"" or ""sont un des dangers?"" - and thank you so much, once again :)"
frenchhelp,fdbkx7i,t1_fdasc5a,1578258365.0,"Quick, random question: so, is it ""qui peut amener **à** des conséquences plus sérieuses"" or ""amener des conséquences"" (without the ""à"")? how would you say it? 

> ""Nous allons donc nous demander"" ok so im not sure about this one because ""il"" is wrong you should say ""je"" but im not sure of you are allowed to use 1st person when i write an essay in french we have to say ""nous"" and any of my history/french teacher would absolutely destroy me if i ever said ""je"" but it's a B2 so maybe it doesn't matter as much ? 

I've used ""on"" before and I've gotten away with it.... so.... But yeah, guess I should try to use ""nous"" more often, hahaha.

> "" aident à à partager des souvenirs et à en créer"" memoire is not the same as memory, mémoire is more a capacity of your brain to keep your memories. 

ahhh such a dumb mistake 

> "" à nous éloigner de ceux qui sont sur nos vies réelles "" i don't get what you mean is it like you prefer validation on social media rather than from the people you know irl ? 

I meant it as in spending so much time online that you get detached from reality, haha.
