PublicFreakout,ffdy5ml,t1_ffdib5n,1579831843.0,"Obviously I can't speak for all the people like this, but anecdotally the ones I know were raised by strict authoritarians, in both extremely religious and hardline military households. They seem to have had instilled in them a sense of what is ""proper"" and the way things should be. When something runs counter to how they were raised or value is placed on something they weren't raised to value, they seem to get upset (possibly threatened). Context also starts to lose meaning when you spend so much time in a purely emotional ""this is the way things have to be done!"" state of mind. This is a very unhealthy mentality to have and feeds anger and fear and uncertainty.

Fast-forward a few decades and people become cemented in their views, especially if they've had negative reinforcement in the form of scapegoating (""this person / group is causing all your problems and undermining your values!"") or personal experiences (""my Irish roommate in college stole from me once thus all Irish people are thieves!"").

Throw in a dash of personality disorders (""those foreigners are talking about me! I think one of them glanced my way for a second; they're so obvious and disrespectful!"") and depression or self-image issues as well as a general mistrust of ""elitist"" professionals (no therapy, likely minimal healthcare even if they can afford it), and suddenly a lot of these behaviors start to make more sense. 

All my quotes in parentheses are examples of things I've heard from family or what I've heard them listening to, whether they realize it or not. You have to tiptoe around these types of people and adhere to certain ""rules"" when speaking with them or they quickly lose their shit. 

The only reason I keep those people in my life is because family / friends won't go no-contact, dispite the substantial harm they cause their family."

AnimalsBeingBros,ff88bpu,t1_ff82z1v,1579668921.0,"Having raised hamsters and then rats as a kid, and current owner of rats, hamsters were cute but much more likely to bite. The only time I have to worry about rat bites is if they're too excited and nip while grabbing food (one also *hates* water, thankfully they don't usually need baths and keep themselves tidy).

When I was a kid I distinctly remember a new hamster that was warming up to me suddenly bite my finger and not letting go, which took a while to heal. Obviously I was trying to socialize with it too soon but I've still never had a rat do that. 

Not sure how accurate it is, but I've heard rats have more behaviors they display before biting because they live in social groups and biting is a last resort. After a few cycles with a colony / mischief you can pick up on them with all the little personalities you see. 

The only aggressive rat I've had is a rescue which was mistreated when he was young; he's has something like social anxiety so he gets overwhelmed quickly by other rats and needs his own cage but by watching him interact with others he still enjoys daily play sessions with his adopted brothers. Sometimes with males they'll get a surge of hormones and act more aggressive but in my experience a day or two on their own is all they need to calm down. Neutering is an option for exterme cases of aggression."
Unexpected,fegb1tf,t1_feg8dkx,1579085708.0,"And Special! It's something of a subversion of superhero movies from 2006, along with Woody Harrelson's Defendor (2009), both of which are indie films I really enjoyed. They did the ""superheroes in real life"" before the Kick-Ass movie (2010 already??) and kept it more realistic.

NightmareOnElmStreet,febns59,t3_eocpql,1578960810.0,"Definitely not trash, I would easily watch it over Freddy's Dead, but it's obvious they weren't sure what direction to take Freddy and the franchise yet.

PrequelMemes,fe5k0n1,t1_fe54o2o,1578870433.0,"That's fair, and I agree that Clone Wars did the heavy lifting for that time period. 

Also for that matter I suppose the prequel trilogy pretty much just had Obi-Wan and Anakin followed by Anakin and Padme for deeper character interaction imo (with some decent Anakin and Palpatine sprinkled in). It may not have been well done but I do think there was more of it for those that liked it. Ewan McGregor really sold it for me, even with the clunky direction / performance at times."
StarWars,fe54e2t,t1_fe3qh16,1578865523.0,I mean yes? But at least Boba Fett impacted the story by following our heroes to Bespin and bringing Han Solo to Jabba.
PrequelMemes,fe4yplu,t1_fe46okq,1578864069.0,"Agreed. Part of what makes it so egregious is that we now know current stormtroopers are actually people, brainwashed stolen children and the movies still use them as cannon fodder for our heroes. Faceless enemies for them to mow down and hoot and holler as they do it while the audience is supposed to forget about First Order troopers' backstory until the plot decides we care again. 

It would be one thing if there was a discussion or at least a throwaway line excusing it like ""doing what must be done to save the galaxy,"" but as far as I recall there's nothing.  

The second biggest issue I had (I mean apart from the writing in general) is the lack of fellowship I felt between the main characters. It feels like they all barely know each other so in TROS, the last movie of the trilogy when they're together and acting like old friends due to the power of offscreen writing, it really doesn't feel earned imo. When C-3PO says ""I'm taking one last look at my friends"" I honestly had to hold back a cynical laugh. 

To me it feels like the sequel trilogy lacks a stable foundation both the OT and PT had, that being heart and characters that care about each other besides Finn and Rey, or Finn and Poe. Most of which had their character development together in the first 30 minutes of TFA.

I'm not usually a nitpicker for my fantasy sci-fi stories as long as they're consistent within themselves. For example I don't really mind Rey's story or writing shortcomings because I love Daisy Ridley and think her charisma carries the character, but when that's what all the characters are relying on (and the cast is quite good) I start to lose my suspension of disbelief."

television,fe4s8dq,t1_fe4fpol,1578862310.0,"That's a nice distinction and accurate. The real problem arises when they're presented with other information and won't reevaluate their views, or worse won't even humor being presented with new information because they're always in the right and would know better if there was a problem with what they like (and get angry that you insinuate otherwise).

StarWars,fe083r7,t1_fe03idt,1578805611.0,"And it really shows by the time ROTJ came along, imo. As a kid ROTJ always felt a little weird to me and Han Solo the most of all. I was never a huge fan of his performance (almost said ""in the last one"") in ROTJ."
aww,fe079kc,t1_fe05qtu,1578804916.0,"Yes and no. You can train them to use a single corner or box, and when I have my rats out some of them will climb to my shoulder and start pawing the back of my head anxiously until I put them back inside their cage and they'll do their business there. Some people will throw down a blanket or other fabric if their rats are out roaming on their bed or elsewhere, so that's an easy shake into the garage and washable. (You have to make sure the material won't catch on their claws though.)

Marking or peeing in small amounts is much more common, at least with male rats, and that is the main reason for throwing down *something for them to run around on. Their droppings should be small and fairly hard with little smell, while their pee produces ammonia which is dangerous in quantities (cleaning their cage regularly is very important or they'll develop breathing problems which can be fatal)."
aww,fe06k2a,t1_fdzfa77,1578804341.0,"I love rats but it is hard with the average being 3 years. My oldest rat I had as a kid lived to be about 6 and he was an outlier. I took a 15ish year break and I currently have several which are 3 years old which I got from a breeder and they probably have roughly a year or so left. (I did lose one to respiratory issues at 2 and another is struggling with the same, but it's managed by medication and most have avoided it.)

One of the difficult decisions to make with older rats and your colony (or ""mischief"") is to whether you get new rat buddies for your old boys / girls as the colony starts to dwindle with age. Rats should always be in at least pairs, even if you have a lot of time for them, so deciding to commit to a new cycle right away is a tough decision.

*One advantage with getting new rats right away is that if integration goes well, your old buddies will be super happy."
Games,fdrzjbf,t3_emqw6m,1578692061.0,"I wish I could still play, I played for a few months when it was released but removed it when my friends dropped off and life got busy. It was fun and hatching eggs was a good excuse for walking around the neighborhood. 

However from the time of release to now, my phone (which I haven't upgraded) no longer runs the game at any reasonable framerate. It always drained the battery and was choppy sometimes, even with the power / processor saving options people online suggested, but my poor S5 has been completely hamstrung by OS updates and now even googling can be a serious pain in the ass sometimes, let alone run a game which never ran amazingly well.

I'd rather not play then spend $500-$1000 on an upgrade I can't reasonably afford."

funny,fdrt8qq,t1_fdrgk8w,1578689425.0,"I'm resigned to the fact that I'll never have a ""great"" steak according to many people's standards. It's considered blasphemous by a lot of people but I hate any meat not prepared fully; medium raw is the closest I can get and that's rolling the dice whether I'll be able to eat it or not. 

I have a gut, instinctual reaction when biting into red or pink meat that screams at me ""this isn't done! You'll get sick or worms!"" and I can't bring myself to eat it or I get queasy. 

Since I was very young it's been hammered into me repeatedly that any food not cooked ""properly"" was a health hazard. *Maybe because the cook in my family was raised on a rural farm without access to proper healthcare.

I'm not so far gone that I prefer ketchup on steak (although I've had it like that as a kid) but I do like it well seasoned with sauce on the side."

Agreed. I wish the director of the Fantastic Four remake got to make the movie he wanted to.

That definitely wouldn't hold up in court, not with a lethal weapon. You can easily kill someone with a wound that was ""only"" meant to maim or be a warning."
HumansAreMetal,fcoapgu,t1_fcnqnvv,1577827642.0,"Right? I'm assuming that revelation was the real reason for the shot; they were probably upset the cheating would be uncovered. 

The rules for people and harassment, whether they be celebirties and paparazzi or not aren't that complicated (although maybe this was before certain laws were made?): If you're followed to a private space like your home, especially if they're pounding on your door or peeking through windows or something then you call the cops. Answering non-lethal actions with potentially lethal actions would be a pretty easy win for a lawyer I imagine. Even with the justification of ""they're trespassing on private land!"" doesn't really excuse trying to murder someone unless they're threatening you. I'm no law student but even I've heard of legal cases where this has come up and a ""justified"" killing was ruled illegal. 

Two other points to consider however is maybe they tried calling the police and were told nothing could be done (again, maybe the local laws have changed since then), or maybe the shooter knew it could be an ambiguous killing and thought they had the money and influence to beat the charge. 

Lots of factors to consider, but generally this is a very bad idea and will be seen as a disproportional response."
politics,fcj7mz1,t1_fcj2tx6,1577679298.0,">It seems the best antidote to hatred of Trump supporters is to know some of them.

The problem here is grouping such a large (relatively) group of people together and assigning the same reasoning to all of them. 

That said, I know a few Trump supporters and several consider themselves libertarians mostly and Trump as the only option because they hated Clinton and believed in voting. It can honestly be hard to get coherent arguments from them but they are there. I mostly chalk that up to them not being used to talking politics and that they hadn't researched Trump as much as focused on Clinton and her downsides. Unfortunate but understandable considering the prevous (hopefully) state of awareness people had of politics.

But then you have the serious Trump supporters. The Donald type of supporters that wholeheartedly approve everything Trump says and does to ""hurt the libs."" The personal Trumper in my family is 100% accurately described by this thread.

He IS Trump, minus the fame, money and family connections.

I've had a front row view to all his derogatory, hateful comments and vindictive ""jokes"" for 30 years because he's the king of his castle at home and doesn't accept any rebuttals or lines of thought that don't match his own. He'll become instantly furious that you're ""personally attacking him"" and go on the offensive when you provide a differing opinion and he'll take that anger out on the family for days. If you do anything but drop the subject it escalates to threats of kicking people out of the house and disowning them / changing the locks.

You don't discuss anything with him, you simply nod and say ""yea"" while he happily talks *at you*.

Thankfully I'm out of that situation but I'm still in contact with him due to other family members who have zero self-esteem or confidence (he ground that into dust over time while manipulating them). If I wasn't concerned with abandoning them I would go no contact. 

So while it's not accurate to say all Trump supporters are like that, you can't pretend they don't exist and all people need is to know one."
