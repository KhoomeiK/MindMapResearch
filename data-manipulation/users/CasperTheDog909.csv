depression,fen8mjk,t3_epvzb0,1579279361.0,"I think this is the sub I like best on reddit. Not because of what's posted, but because we're all really just support each other and getting support. One doesn't always need to be treated like a child with a wound like some (most, in my area) do/believe. Just this sub is enough to make me smile, even if it's just the simple smile, it's still something. Thank you all, and also I wish you luck in life."
