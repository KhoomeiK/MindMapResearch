People have developed a near-symbiotic relation with these. The dogs are fed regularly by people. There are some who make a lot of rice with milk and other foods / chapatis (wheat bread) etc and go around feeding the dogs. 

The dogs come running to those that feed / love them. They also seem to ""keep tabs"" on strangers / strange vehicles. There have not been any cases of rabies / dog bites in the recent past. The people like us that love on these creatures find them a wonderful stress relief.

A big minus was that they insisted on ""housing loan protection insurance"" from SBI Insurance as a condition for the loan, and we had to pay one time premium for the allotted duration of the loan - though the protection went on reducing with the loan amount!

Please don't worry at all. We can learn to use language well by constant practice. I'm from a small village in Alleppey, but had a really good English teacher in Class 5, who encouraged the three Rs. Reading, writing and ""thinking"" in English does help fluency a lot.
