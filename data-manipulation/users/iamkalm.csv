aww,ffmiwnv,t1_ffmh5n6,1580055396.0,Really? What's the reason for the color change? What sounds does she make? I think nocturnal frog/cricket sounds are soothing unless you're going to tell me she booms like a bullfrog lol. I asked about hand feeding for teaching tricks - how do you feel about holding live crickets for her?
aww,ffmgkqq,t1_ffmdfg3,1580054348.0,"Thank you for your speedy reply! A meter jump? Wow! From such a tiny, little girl! Do you hand feed her or is it better for her to catch her own dinner? How often does she feed? Does Azzi live in the same tank as Queen Cress? Do they interact with each other in any way? Oops, this was supposed to be just a thank you response, but my curiosity took over again, I hope that's ok"
aww,ffmcwrq,t3_eu6943,1580052600.0,"I've never known anyone with frogs for pets so may I ask a couple of probably really basic questions? You referred to Cress as your queen Cress. Is her name Queen Cress or does the term queen have it's own definition in the frog world, like mare or colt in the horse world? How does she respond to your presence? Does she like to be pet or handled at all? Is it possible to teach her tricks? And, if she does have tricks, please post a video. She appears to be in an aquarium, is that right? Are those little orange dots her footprints? Oh, dear, that was more than a couple, wasn't it? I'll stop asking so you may start answering, if you would, please"

You left out the lies, drama and over the top emotions that Hollywood has conditioned us to expect and portrayed this relationship, beginning to end, in a much more honest and accurate way. Your protagonist's thought process could be just about anyone's late night musings as they're trying to fall asleep. Thank you."
