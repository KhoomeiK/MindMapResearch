If you want perfect consistancy scrambled eggs the key is stirring them continually thriough the entire cooking process. This leaves you with the smoothest scrambled eggs you will try. Tiny bit of milk or cheese  can be stirred in.

Basically though if you stir em lots you will mix any water back in."

As for the bike. If you can try before you buy do. you want something that feels comfortable to ride around normally before you try tricks. Dont' worry about completes or make. Go for what you feel is comfortable and within budget. Hi ten frameswill be heavier. The more you pay the lighter the frame gets. Its doesn't necessarily get stronger despite the claims. The reason chromo bikes are lighter is they need less metal to be stroing. Also more expensive should mean better welds but again.. mileage will vary. Always go with the double walled rims though.
