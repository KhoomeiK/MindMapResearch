I did something similar and took it a step further by building a web application that takes user input to manage the scripts. This allows anyone to use your code. I’d recommend Django or Flask. 

Good work though. Keep it going!"

getdisciplined,fco97j2,t3_ei264k,1577826616.0,"Yes. I journal on a private Wordpress blog setup. Being electronic provides a place to store everything neatly and access to read or write from anywhere in the world. Plus it’s easier for me to type than write and easier for me to read text than my own handwriting. 

One tidbit about journaling is that you don’t need to feel obligated to journal every single day. Personally, journaling everyday started to feel like a chore and I’d have to force myself to do it, associating negative feelings in my mind with journaling. Now I journal anywhere from 1 to 5 times a month to get my thoughts out when needed and it’s been just as beneficial mentally and I love it."
learnpython,fcnoby6,t3_ei2plx,1577815306.0,"+1 to everyone recommending MIT 6.00.6, however, that course isn’t that great for a complete beginner. 

Start by reading “Grokking Algorithms”. It’ll introduce data structures in a complete noob friendly manner. 

Then watch the MIT course."
