philosophy,feyon4r,t1_fekzjuw,1579448390.0,"We need a paradigm shift, towards a new way of understanding. Perhaps one where subjective descriptions start to overlap with our descriptions of the outside world. Maybe it will come from gradually eroding the hard border between inside/outside the mind. Maybe chipping away at it by expanding our capacities using brain-machine interfaces, or shifting our perspective entirely by changing to a new standard of evidence. I believe at some point we will change, and the research question will somehow not need to be asked anymore."

If they are OK, that means it is not necessarily about the liquid consumption or the ethanol, but more about generally inebriation."

The big names in the field have massive influence on what research topics are ""hot"" right now. That means lots of those publications, so they kind of decide the path. Not that this necessarily means the publications are wrong, just that they are about a certain topic and not another. That's just one example.

depression,fddzn14,t3_ekv8l4,1578327822.0,"I respect you for choosing such a demanding career. Not much to add from my side, except that you have a medical problem and are actively trying to address it. This is all you can do. It sucks that your colleague wants you gone, and to work in an environment like that. They seem quite cold-hearted though, but are probably also trapped by the same sense of duty to the kids, that you feel. That could be something fundamental that you share and could possibly still bond over. Understandable that it makes you feel bad when unable to fulfil the duty (feeling of worthlessness). Also it could be true that in the grand scheme of things, every hour you do spend teaching kids, you are affecting many lives in a positive way. Teaching (passing on culture) is what makes us human, so you are participating in one of the most typical human things there are. However, you have many factors to balance in life, of which that is only one. Hoping you will cope."
depression,fddyf9b,t3_ekr070,1578327004.0,"Yo man I also think it kind of got out of hand in modern day society. I perceive admitting working for money as a taboo. I perceive admitting that I do not have a clear career ambition as a taboo. I don't know what we're doing to eachother. Feels  like admitting those things, you become a liability and at risk of getting let go. That is because there is a choice of people ready to take up the position, who are (or are also not..) genuinely passionate about the work. A constant reminder in my own head, when considering these things is also 'don't ruin something you like by making it your job'. What's even the right thing to strive for here?"
