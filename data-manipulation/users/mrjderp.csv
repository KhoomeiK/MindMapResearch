> How many employees the DoD has doesn't matter

It absolutely matters and is directly relevant; if they employed fewer then they’d pollute less. Your entire issue is the amount they pollute, and because the number of people employed by them is directly correlated to the amount they pollute it’s directly relevant to your argument.*

Someone knowledgeable about the subject should be surprised by this? That makes zero sense. If they’re knowledgeable about the subject then this would be known already and therefore unsurprising.

All subjective conclusions. Where is your objective evidence supporting these claims? Furthermore, what is their relevance to how shocking the amount they pollute is? It’s not.

The article makes direct comparisons between two substantially different cases, ergo apples and oranges. They’re comparable insomuch as they’ve been compared, not that the comparison holds merit.

So no, I’m not the one making this about populations and comparing pollution of citizens to that of a defense department, you are. If you think that’s “laughable,” you’re laughing at yourself.

> I was making a comparison for him to say that it is surprising because being the biggest (most populated) employer doesn't just give a free pass

A comparison between two unrelated things to counter an argument that was never levied; nobody said anyone should get a “free pass,” you’re still making up straw men arguments, they said the fact isn’t surprising; which, *again*, is subjective. What is surprising to some isn’t to others, and it’s not up to you to decide what’s surprising to whom.

LMAO, to hear excuses for an Alliance with Hitler and participation in the genocide, it’s so nice. /s

Was the Soviet Union also “forced” to divide up the territories they did with the Nazis?  Which of the “democratic” countries gained land in alliances with the Nazis?

Multiple times in this thread when you’re arguing that Poland and Finland were evil but the Soviet Union was the ultimate hand of good, yet when I mention an alliance with the Nazis to divide up other countries lands as invaders you immediately jump to defend the Soviet Union’s actions.

How funny that you lambast Finland for this despite Soviet Russia literally doing the same; or do you not believe the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a thing?"
