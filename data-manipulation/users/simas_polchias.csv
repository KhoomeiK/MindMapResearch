And he can also imagine the new scale of both happy praises and unhappy backlash (both because the show's success and failure). He is not among his personal literature's fan anymore, there are just fans of literature, just fans of series, just fans of modern media and all other 21 century's societal shitshow. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand if he is scared by such circumstances.

> and make him a ton of money.

Probably, passed this step already with the show's early seasons. Was rich, became stupidly-rich. Considering his age, there is a big chance he wants to try to spend what he already has instead of making more nearly-unspendable money.

> Also, he's always been a writer. He loves writing stories, and he especially says the end is the best.

Maybe that's why he is writing encyclopaedias and other series instead?

Count the years he is promising to do it, plz.

He probably could do it before the series, we would probably have Winter book by now and waited for the Summer book.

But he would hardly do it after the success of the series, because of the *completely new* fame, money and other pleasant options opening. He was just famous, he became real famous.

And he sure won't do anything now, after the series fell down into a complete disaster. Even if he is not the one to blame.

And good writers would also show us that Night King is not just the necromancer troll, but have other aces in his sleeves. Attacking with fooking blizzards, which can turn a soldier into a grinded meat and an army into a bunch of slowly-freezing cannibals. Marking people and invading their dreams, making them betray the living out of sheer terror.

Sam qualifies under 2/4 of excuses at least. Thus ""the horde"" just recognizes him and spares, due to his history or future role. Probably him slaying the White Walker can be attributed to the same reason."

freefolk,fglimat,t1_fgjz5nq,1580899660.0,"I assume that in the Night King's army only Night King has a free will (or the most free will, if the theory about a fantazy version of a rebelling Skynet is true). 

The White Walker we are talking about is unarmored, probably a low-level if using rpg terminology. Also *it* lacks an ice sword, but armed with a simple spear. Spear is still a deadly weapon in trained hands (rip, Oberyn!), but from a status perspective is inferior to blades (think pikemen / knights status difference and proportions in the ranks).

Thus, this White Walker is may be just a little more sentient than a mindless horde *it* is ""leading"". Probably, the order from the Night King or superior White Walker reduces *it*'s mind into just going somewhere, hearding the corpses which was given under *it*'s custody. Poor thing probably can't even raise dead by *it*self yet.

Thus *it*'s contradicting reaction. *It* hates people and would impale this warm sack otherwise, but *it* have more pressing and undeniable orders."
40kLore,fglhbsh,t1_fgl79mr,1580897759.0,"Maybe, that is just a technical requirement? 

Considering things like necrontech (Celestial Orrery), WH40k world certainly has such levels of organisation where magic and science can hardly be separated, giving us possible memetical explanations.

What if the very knowing about such arcane endeavours makes them linearly or exponentially more difficult and complex to achieve? Emperor knows how to ""spark"" a new, human-exclusive Webway (or how to ""breach"" into the existing one, probably left by Old Ones and appropriated by Eldar) -- and that will require the productive power of half of the Imperium, including raw resources, scientific processes annd combined *psychic* powers. Emperor trusts Malcador with this knowledge -- the requirements instantly triple, but that is the risk they are willing to take, including the need to expand the Imperium, which now lacks the required resources by a measure of 30%.

Or, even more simple, the very idea of the Webway can be ""polluted"" on some metaphysical level, thus it should not be shared among the uncapable before the realisation begins and the idea (really, just a very complex and vulnerable supernatural blueprint) will finally stabilize."
40kLore,fglgno6,t3_ez4zco,1580896791.0,"> What's odd though is Valdor comments on this as if he knows the Emperor is either becoming, or is, something more than human at this point, and says ""Then his human sentiments... are still ebbing?""

The Emperor Heresy? Because of him slowly dispercing into such different (and even adversary) things which were previously solid and mutually-supressed: ancient psyker treating reality as a malleable thing, immortal ruler refusing himself basic familial ties, atheistic or dystheistic conqueror in denial of being a supernatural (and probably malignant) entity etc.

> descend into unstable psychological states that made them similar to the very warlords they were fighting

It looks like we finally have an explanation from where exactly the Emperor got his idea about leaning on transhuman ranks (which is usual to us know, but from the bystander POV looks very peculiar with all these organs and mortality rates).
