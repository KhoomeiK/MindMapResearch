androidapps,fcb5whw,t1_fcawczy,1577582774.0,"Oh me too, and I love my dark layout 80-90% of the time. If not a little more. And with Nova dynamic notifications, even when I can't see the greyed out icons in bright light, I can see who texted me as a little colored picture that stands out as the only thing I can see - and it works. A quick switch wallpaper definitely works better for me, but Niagara and KISS are so light, it was neat for a while having them accessible through a couple taps on the home button. In the end though yeah, wanted to stick with 100% one launcher.

Sorry, I'm chatty. Have a good weekend and happy new year :)"
androidapps,fcardy6,t1_fcaon2a,1577575121.0,"Well I use ""murdered out"" grey icons on a black screen and love it 80% of the time. Only have a dock and search bar. Sometimes the light I'm in makes that impossible to see. So I looked into quick-change options for icons and found nothing. Then I figured well, I could use a lightweight launcher like Niagara, and it worked brilliantly for switching from my greyed out icons in Nova to a quick skeletal white text on black screen launcher with Niagara. Like seamless speed. Did that for quite some time. Then I found a wallpaper changer app that lets me just 1-click on an icon/widget and bounce between a black or lighter colored wallpaper and I've stuck with that since."
