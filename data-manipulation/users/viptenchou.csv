NamiMains,ffjjijg,t3_etvtvd,1579999643.0,"My two favorite skins for Nami are splendid staff and river spirit. 

Splendid staff is super pretty with lovely animations. The recall is one of the best for Nami, too. 

River spirit looks nice but isnít as pretty as SS imo. But the particle effects are super pretty. I love the glittering splashes when she autos and stuff and all the sparkles in the ulti. :) Also, she sings a bit of her theme on the recall which is nice as well! 

But SS has a lot of pretty chromas too. So you can spend a bit more to have some variety as well.

Anyway. Yes. I think itís worth it, itís one of her best skins without a doubt."

Seems he's on a Sett high atm."
MalzaharMains,ffdr90i,t3_elodj0,1579826978.0,"I‚Äôm a bit late but it‚Äôs between battle boss and snow day, obviously. 

I like snow day over all much better. It looks better, the recall is better (battle boss recall always makes me do a double take thinking someone is coming to kill me when I‚Äôm low and trying to recall and check the shop) and it has poro voidlings, how cute. 

I find that snow day E particle is a lot easier to see, which can be good or bad. Battle boss E can be very hard to spot which may be good in a team fight because the enemy may not notice it but at the same time, it‚Äôs hard to see for me too which is troublesome.  

Battle boss also has a snappier auto animation imo. I find it much easier to last hit with for some reason. 

Overall, I prefer snow day but that snappy auto is really nice for battle boss imo."
MalzaharMains,ffdq6sd,t1_ffdoey9,1579826308.0,"I just don‚Äôt understand why ori gets to have such a lane bully style if she scales arguably better than malz. That seems a bit unfair. Low CD and no mana issues early, tons of zone and poke tools, hard hitting autos, wave clear, team fight ulti that‚Äôs actually bonkers. Gosh. Should I be playing ori??? Lol

But yeah, that‚Äôs basically what I ended up having to do. Just play passively and let her shove me under turret. Which feels really, really bad as malzahar. :("
MalzaharMains,ffdk6g5,t1_ffcdwny,1579822609.0,"I‚Äôm also new to malz and was wondering. How do you shove wave at early levels? I find that I run out of mana so fast and the enemy laner is usually smart enough to instantly target my voidlings, which is not only a massive waste of mana but denies my shove very effectively. 

One thing I think I should be doing differently is how I approach clearing the early waves but I‚Äôm not sure how to do it. Currently, I just get one melee kinda low and then E it and W and then start autoing the next minion. Should I be autoing the back line and starting there? Should I be getting all the melees to mid health before casting e-w? 

Any suggestions appreciated. I find my early lane to be very terrible. I‚Äôm usually 20 - 30 Cs behind my opponent and get bullied or zoned easily which I feel shouldn‚Äôt happen if I‚Äôm playing malz. (Though this may be largely because I am a platinum support main trying to learn mid so I‚Äôm usually going against plat - diamond mid laners and I have no idea about any match ups and I‚Äôm new to CSing in general and am playing at 200 ping). 

Should I poke as malz? Usually I‚Äôm so focused on just trying to Cs, I never touch my lane opponent unless e just bounces onto them which is rare because most people at plat+ know not to stand next to an infected, dying minion. But I get poked and bullied hard. :("
MalzaharMains,ffdj3aw,t1_ffd3ngr,1579821939.0,"Zed has been my permaban too. I really hate laning against him, I feel like I can‚Äôt even get in range to farm because his shadows give him so much extra range to throw spells at you and once he hits 6, you‚Äôre probably gonna die. And I don‚Äôt do enough damage to kill him outright at 6 by myself. Not to mention, even if my jg ganks for me and I ulti him, he somehow manages to slip away if we don‚Äôt get enough damage out which happens often if it‚Äôs a tanky jungler rather than a damage one. 

I don‚Äôt mind talon. He‚Äôs fine to lane against and if he roams, I spam ping it and then punish the roam by hard shoving and taking plates, or by roaming to the opposite side lane if possible. 

I think my worst nightmares are oriannas and anivias but I don‚Äôt see them often enough to warrant a ban. Orianna pokes so much and I feel like there‚Äôs literally nothing I can do - her ball moves so fast, it‚Äôs impossible to dodge. But to be fair, last time I laned against her it was a diamond ori and I‚Äôm a platinum 4 support main trying to learn mid. Lmao. Anivia just cucks my wave clear hard and it sucks. Makes me feel useless. :(

I‚Äôve only laned against a syndra once and it was pretty miserable too though."
SorakaMains,ffdhke5,t3_ervh5d,1579821015.0,"E got nerfed hard a bit ago. Damage lowered, cooldown increased. It‚Äôs no longer worth it to level this ability first. 

Standard now is 3 points in Q. It gives a LOT more self healing (that can also pass on to allies), gives a much bigger move speed buff and works in any direction - not just when running away from enemies anymore. 

However, if you‚Äôre really struggling to land your Q for whatever reason (maybe they‚Äôre too mobile like a tumbling vayne or a slippery Rakan, or perhaps you‚Äôre just having trouble predicting their movement or are very oppressed and can‚Äôt step forward), whatever the case, if this happens you can take 1 or 2 points in Q and immediately swap over to w max."
SorakaMains,ffdfonh,t3_estilc,1579819899.0,"The not doing damage bug is hella annoying because it also won‚Äôt proc your spellthiefs in that case. Really irks me, because it has a long cooldown and so there goes my peel that I was risking for some poke and procs and I get literally nothing out of it even though it‚Äôs supposed to be nearly impossible to miss. Fun times. 

It happens to me virtually every game in laning phase at least once."
leagueoflegends,ffan3aq,t1_ffajpd5,1579739824.0,"Yeah, it's the best of the lot for sure. 

But what really upsets me is that apparently this is the replacement for the lunar revel line. They said the skins are ""not popular in the west"". Excuse me?? I happen to think those skins are gorgeous and I think a lot of people like them, too. They may not get used quite as often but that's probably because they are seasonal and maybe a few tweaks could be made (example: the pig for vayne's weapon. I get it was the year of the pig but I think that's what holds the skin back. Just put the cute pig somewhere in the recall). Also they tend to give them to popular champs who already have amazing skins to choose from (ie: Lux, Jinx, etc). 

But it's kind of funny that they're saying lunar revel and snow down skins aren't as popular as other lines. Well, no shit. They're seasonal so you can't always buy them and may not have money or may not be playing actively when they are. My friend really wants count kledula or whatever but he keeps missing the chance to buy it, for example. And idk but I see firecracker jinx, warring kingdoms Vi, lunar empress Lux, snow day bard, snow day malz, etc fairly regularly. :shrug: Not as often as Star Guardian Jinx, battle academia or elementalist lux, etc. But still it's not like I never see them."
leagueoflegends,ffah51g,t1_ff9m5wz,1579735622.0,"I saw a picture of the skin before it released on surrender at 20 and died laughing. I showed it to my friend and said ‚Äúguess which champ this is‚Äù.

summonerschool,ffaej77,t3_escb99,1579733789.0,"It‚Äôs entirely 100% possible to climb to plat only playing easy champs and I think most people can do it. You can probably get to diamond without too much issue that way as long as your macro play is on point and you know your match ups. 

Once you hit diamond and start working toward masters, it will become a lot harder to make progress with those easier champs but still entirely possible - there are one tricks for every champ at challenger level. There‚Äôs a Garen one trick. There‚Äôs a Soraka one trick. You can do it with enough skill and dedication. 

I reached plat playing primarily Soraka, whom is obviously not a very mechanical champion. 

I also play malzahar mid. I‚Äôm only just learning mid but I can still be useful and play the game against much better mid laners than myself because he‚Äôs such an easy champ. I can farm pretty safely and he basically farms for me with his voidlings. If my opponent ever dares to roam, I can hard shove the wave and get platings. If they back, I can shove the wave and roam for a gank. If my jungler is around and I have ult, we can probably kill him as long as I didn‚Äôt die to him early. 

Come mid to late game, all I have to do is use my ultimate on a priority target or anyone trying to dive my back line and I do a lot of damage to neutral objectives so I can help a lot with those. 

Honestly, I really suck at mid. A lot. I don‚Äôt do as much damage as a malzahar could or should do. But because I play for objectives and have a high impact ultimate, I still have a high win rate playing him. Typically play against silver - plat in norms when I go mid. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm actually fucking bronze if I were to queue up and rank as mid though. 

Soraka is a different story. I‚Äôm much better at support and she is my highest mastery champ. I know exactly how to play her. But still, she‚Äôs easy and straight forward. Her ability to keep others alive is huuuge. I don‚Äôt have to be great at the game if I can keep someone who is alive. üòè All I need to do is know where to be, keep good vision to help my team, have map awareness to ult and save people across the map, use my simple af kit to aid my team and position properly. Easy. :)

The real challenge with easy champs is that you need to know how to maximize everything they can do and need to know exactly what they *can* do in the best case scenario. You need to be using that champ in ways that others are gonna go ‚Äúwoah, How the hell did this GAREN just out play me???‚Äù. At least, to get to challenger anyway. :p You‚Äôd probably end up playing them a bit unconventionally at that point. but plat isn‚Äôt so tricky."
supportlol,ffadcqa,t1_ff8vv83,1579732886.0,"That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs not terrible but still not optimal and I just don‚Äôt see why they feel compelled to force certain stats on us if we don‚Äôt want to risk our lives for poke, else we end up without wards until significantly later. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (I would be ok with it being riskier in terms of me maybe dying if it didn‚Äôt mean that hard lost lanes might leave me in the dark, snowballing the loss even harder with no vision)."
supportlol,ff8vg7w,t1_ff8u9gn,1579697444.0,"Yeah I could definitely see that being the case. Poor Rakan can't really poke but wants AP. Honestly, I don't really see why they should force us to play aggressive/poke just because we want some AP. 

Like, I play malzahar mid and he scales really hard with AP. I play like a puss in lane and survive and that's ok but if I wanna do that as a support and still scale with some AP that's not ok? lol. It's not like it's entirely beneficial to always just outright do this swap either or else everyone would do it, too. You lose mana regen and you also need your teammate nearby for procs unlike spellthiefs. And you miss out on some gold.

Feels bad imo. :s"
SorakaMains,ff7ry0z,t3_es4438,1579656901.0,What are you trying to build with a blasting wand? That may be part of the reason why you feel you have no gold. Soraka can thrive off really cheap items with affordable components. Her heals feel super strong after two items (Athenes + Ardent).
supportlol,ff7oi1w,t3_es38g3,1579654490.0,"I don‚Äôt understand why they would do this. What‚Äôs the harm in allowing us to swap as needed? Sometimes you get spellthiefs and realize you can‚Äôt complete it in a reasonable time if you‚Äôre hard losing so you have to swap to relic. (I assume it resets the quest gold). 

And ok, having a safe lane with relic and swapping to spellthiefs may seem like abuse (safe lane, not missing out on AP later) but who cares? You‚Äôre still giving up 240 gold to do it, which out of 1000 gold (which is really more like 600 if you factor in the initial cost), it‚Äôs still a trade off you should keep in mind and only use if necessary. 

But now what? You can just keep getting gold at the cost of vision..? I could see solo laners abusing this too. Especially if you do something cheesy like Soraka top who can‚Äôt farm well anyway. 

Bad change imo.

I loved going relic into spellthiefs for Soraka. üòî

EDIT: I just tested it in the practice tool and it still seems like it's possible to switch...? I earned about 100 gold and swapped to relic and kept the gold. Then I earned 500 and later 1000 and swapped to relic and it upgraded instantly. I sold it and bought spellthiefs to check if it worked that way and it still did. It even works when swapping between AP and AD items. :shrug: Dunno what's up with that, or is the patch not live yet...?"
supportlol,ff7kc9x,t3_es1dkn,1579651590.0,"(Note: You can skip to the bottom for warding suggestions) You might consider picking up Nami. She has very good catch potential. Nami can heavily discourage diving with her ultimate and bubble and sustain through any tough lanes. At the same time, she can play very aggressively with good positioning and have decent kill threat as well. 

Anyway, this may not be what you want as a suggestion but I just thought I‚Äôd mention it because I think she‚Äôs a great support - very flexible and useful even in situations where you‚Äôre getting camped. She allows you to play aggressively when you‚Äôre not but also defensively when you are, which is great. The problem with champs like Leona, naut and blitz are that they have limited peel and if they go in, they probably aren‚Äôt getting back out. (Naut is the best for peel but if they‚Äôre massively ahead, he‚Äôll still struggle I feel). They‚Äôre also quite transparent in what they want to do. A champ who has more options and flexibility would be good imo. 

Thresh could also work but I suggested Nami as I feel she is easier to pick up, is in a very good spot right now and is also fun to play. 

If playing Nami and you‚Äôre getting camped, stay at tower and keep your ult for disengage. Remember to always lead into a bubble with other cc - so, use your E to apply a slow and make landing bubbles easier.

**warding and roaming tips:** If you have no interest in picking up a new champ, then disregard my post. My only suggestion for a Leona/naut/blitz who is struggling bot lane is to try and roam and see if you can make something happen elsewhere. Make sure your friend plays very safe while you‚Äôre gone. Create pressure elsewhere on the map and that may force the jungler to try and help other lanes. Ask your jungler to assist you in getting deep wards in the enemy jungle. Try to get those wards when you see the enemy jungler somewhere else on the map. 

If you are red side, a good ward to put if the jungler keeps sweeping the typical places is to get inside the dragon pit and ward behind it. It‚Äôll catch the jungler pathing from red or raptors down through jungle to you. It won‚Äôt protect if they path from lane or krugs though, but it‚Äôs something and may even catch out the midlaner. 

For either side, consider warding the bush near the upper entrance to red side bot jungle. The one near pixel bush. This one is less often swept but can still see some vision of someone in the river. 

For blue side, try to place a ward in the newly added bush by the entrance near dragon. A lot of people still aren‚Äôt used to checking that and you can even get away with a pink ward there for some time in a lot of cases. A ward just over that wall is also good to see gromp and blue."

SorakaMains,ff7e00j,t3_erudl7,1579647366.0,"Vision control is important, especially in the alcove once he hits six. Always keep a ward there and never let him have control over that area. 

Don‚Äôt stand close to minions or your adc to avoid his crow poke. Harass him if he ever goes to drain a minion. Personally, I‚Äôd try to either push them under tower (fiddle is pretty useless under tower and if he uses his crow, he‚Äôll likely mess up Cs for his adc) or try to keep it at your own turret to encourage ganks from your jungler since fiddle, outside of his fear, can‚Äôt do much about a gank. 

Consider a mikaels for his fear. The extra MR will also help you deal with some of his damage, too. 

On the bright side, he‚Äôs getting reworked very soon and I have a feeling that his new kit will be much stronger in the jungle than as a support so we may be seeing the death of fiddle support. One can hope, anyway. I have to assume they are focusing on getting him back in the jungle. Well, with any luck he won‚Äôt be super busted."

A modest lifestyle would be getting a used but reliable car, maybe two if sharing is not possible. 

And maybeeee you don‚Äôt get every single new console and game that you want. I mean, I have been wanting to get all the new PlayStations since forever but the last one I ever got was a PS2.

I don‚Äôt know why travel is seen as living luxuriously. A lot of us who travel do it once a year and keep our spending absolutely minimal in other places to facilitate it. I spend ~70 dollars on food per week for 2 people. If I were being lavish, I could easily spend $100 or more. We don‚Äôt really do things, like bars or movies, etc. Very rare if we do.

zyramains,ff17df7,t3_eqy82z,1579475996.0,"Hmmm... when I play Soraka, I always get relic and a lot of people don‚Äôt understand why. But it‚Äôs because you will reliably get income - and FAST. You complete the quest entirely very early. 

And it‚Äôs a little known fact, it seems, but you can just sell it for 160 gold once you complete it and buy spellthiefs. It‚Äôll instantly turn into shard of true ice. So for a cost of 240 gold, you can have a reliable and safe laning phase with easy gold income and then get the better stats after. 

That said, I don‚Äôt think I would do this on Zyra. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to get spellthiefs procs on her because of her plants. I‚Äôm brand new to playing her but I usually complete the first part of the quest by 9 minutes whereas on my main (Soraka), it can take closer to 13 minutes to get it because her Q is actually tricky to land due to the slow travel time at max distance and the ridiculously long CD on E (and the fact that you should save it for peel in many match ups). 

Zyra‚Äôs Q is pretty easy to land. Big hit box, instant hit. And then her plants can proc more. And her auto range is huge at 575. (For reference, most other supports are typically 550 or less). And the mana regen is pretty important for her (unlike Soraka who has low mana costs so i don‚Äôt need it early).

I guess I‚Äôll just keep her as a support pick. I really need something easy and reliable for mid since I‚Äôm very bad at it.

Aery vs guardian is just preference. I'd rather survive mid - late game burst with resolve runes than have a bit more poke damage in lane personally - and have access to domination secondary. But to each their own."

I don't really care what role I learn but I just want to learn a solo lane or something so that I'm not so dependent on playing with an adc friend (I hate playing with random adcs....anxiety). 

I guess what I wanted to know, which I didn't express well in my post, was if she was relatively easy to play mid. A lot of the answers have been a bit off putting as they all seem to say she's very easy to gank, doesn't have as much power in her burst and relies a lot on mana and can't roam well. u__u;;

How do you find her to be in top lane? Is she a bit easier there or can she have a very rough go of it? I'm really garbage at playing solo lanes and want to get better but it's hard to find a champ I enjoy that clicks with me. D:

What do your runes and items look like? What is your must ban? Who gives you the roughest lane? What's your best match ups? In your opinion. I'd love to hear more about it if you're willing to share. :)"
zyramains,fexkhp1,t1_fexban6,1579432451.0,"I guess I worded it poorly. I'm not exactly sure how to word it but for example, Morgana is definitely not meta but a lot of people consider her an easier champ to play in the mid lane because she's got very little lane interaction and is very safe and can push with her w and farm from afar. 

I guess what I was wondering is, rather than just ""is it possible"" or ""is it meta"" is...is it ""beginner friendly"" and a relatively safe and easy mid laner to try mid with. I figured maybe she was similar to morg or malz because in my mind, I thought ""she can farm with her plants safely similar to malzahar with his minions and she can protect herself from ganks with her E root/plants and ulti, right?"" But I guess I'm wrong. lol

It sounds like, no, she isn't what I thought. Very easy to gank, heavily reliant on mana and lacks the burst power of most other mids and can't solo kill easily - according to the other answers here. Kind of sad to hear it! :( She's a lot of fun to play but I'm quite bad at mid so I need something easy and safe. e__e;"
SorakaMains,fevxzf1,t1_fen4nz0,1579402952.0,"You can just sell the relic shield once you complete the quest and buy spellthiefs. It'll automatically and instantly transform into shard of true ice.

It sells back for 160 gold, so overall you're only spending an additional 240 gold for a safe laning phase and you'll probably complete the quest muuuuch faster too. (Im pretty sure you can finish tier 3 relic by like 13 minutes or something crazy fast like that if you're always using it on cannons and melees every chance you get).

Not a lot of people talk about this for some reason but I think it's pretty huge."
SorakaMains,fevx6op,t3_eq22e6,1579402615.0,"I take these runes 90% of the time, actually, and have great success in platinum elo with them. The only difference is that I take ghost poro over taste of blood. I think both can work well though but I like the additional AP you gain from ghost poro (and it can be stacked fairly early on) and it also gives some additional vision which is great to look out for ganks in the early laning phase. 

Also, I always take relic on Soraka unless it's a very easy match up. For a cost of like 240 gold, you can just sell it and buy spellthiefs once you complete the quest anyway. (It will keep your progress and instantly turn into the shard of true ice). This will give you an easy, safe laning phase and you'll complete your quest waaay faster than you would with spellthiefs and then you can swap it for AP and mana regen for a small fee.

People often TELL me that, in fact. Because as an enchanter, your job is to literally make it so others can carry... 

Also, I duo with someone who is a pretty good player as well. He swears it's a 50/50 lane though and that if I do poorly, he can't carry. Which is true. If I feed in lane or can't help him to establish priority, aggression or whatever... we tend to lose. Although we CAN just play and scale, we like to do Ashe/Nami a lot and in this lane, it's important to play aggressive and get an early lead. BUT I can't help but feel like, even if I'm doing ok - it's his spectacular play that makes it work. As long as I can do a little bit right, he can roll with it and make it work.

JapanTravel,fev6q96,t1_fev3s9x,1579393754.0,"In my experience, Japanese cons are not at all like American cons and American cons are much more fun and friendly. 

Japanese cons are more about merchandise and showing off cosplays. American cons are more about making friends, sharing interests and having fun. 

There‚Äôs some crossover in this but let me explain; the biggest thing of Japanese cons is the dealers room. Yes, this is a huge thing in American cons as well but unless she can read Japanese, she‚Äôll get little value out of most things since it‚Äôs largely doujinshi. And yes, showing off cosplays is also popular in American cons but in Japan, almost all of the cosplayers just... stand in one spot and pose for a loooong line of sweaty guys with cameras. Did I mention that 90% of the cosplayers are slutty girls who will stand half naked for hours letting people take picks even in the middle of winter when it‚Äôs 5 degrees outside? Nothing wrong with that but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the place for a (mentally) 12 year old. In America, there tend to be tons of people wearing low quality costumes, just having fun making friends and joking around. There are of course people in amazing costumes who can‚Äôt walk 2 feet. Without being stopped for pics but that‚Äôs a lot different from the roped off for pictures specifically kind of deal I witnessed in Japan. 

Also, she‚Äôs not going to make many friends if she can‚Äôt speak Japanese - which is arguably the most fun part about American cons. 

Also, I didn‚Äôt personally notice any super fun events that are common in the US like the dating game but even if there was one, she wouldn‚Äôt understand it unless she speaks Japanese so again.... a waste. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend a con especially if she loves US ones. Very different. Though I should stress again, this is from my experience as I used to go to cons every year in the US before moving to Japan and I adored it. I went to a couple in Japan and it was painfully boring."

I had gotten an S in games where I did less damage, had less kill participation and felt like I barely did anything but I had perfect KDA and the game lasted longer than 25 minutes. In similar games where I had perfect KDA but the enemy team surrendered at 22 minutes, I only got an S-. 

I think vision score is also important but I usually just always have a high vision score in games lasting 25+ minutes so I can‚Äôt say for certain. 

Apparently Cs score is important even as support but I also couldn‚Äôt say cause as Nami, I don‚Äôt Cs. Ever.

I've heard that you can complete the quest with relic and then sell it back and buy spellthiefs and it'll stay completed (as shard of true ice). Apparently it sells back for 200 gold so it only costs 200 extra to do it. I've never actually checked to see if that's true but if it is, I'm wondering if it might be worth it to swap over once it's complete for the AP and mana regen stats. Mainly because health regen is kind of shit on Soraka since her base health regen is like .5 to begin with so 100% is only gonna be +1 HP which is really sad. I mean, I get that she's designed to need to land Q's to regen but I just feel .5 base is incredibly harsh.

Otherwise, she's pretty easy to play and quite fun! :)"
NamiMains,feiowqj,t3_ep6tvz,1579143598.0,"Nami's kit is very versatile. She's great at any point in the game and regardless of if you're ahead or behind. She doesn't have any super hard counters, making her a decent blind pick as well. She does struggle against hard engage but it's nothing she can't deal with as her passive can help her dodge skill shots and speed away from a dangerous situation and her ulti + bubble can disengage easily. But if you do find yourself struggling for whatever reason - maybe the enemy is just outplaying you or they've had a lot of jungle/mid help or your adc is a potato, she can be very defensive and just play sustain. Her heal is one of the more substantial heals in the game (beaten only by Soraka in my opinion) and again, she has peel with her bubble + ulti AND can slow enemies and speed up allies. As a huge bonus, as long as you have your ulti up, diving you is a really bad idea. Nami can turn the tides of a dive (heh) very easily by ulting and bubbling someone under turret (and then slowing them down so if they DO survive long enough to try and get away, they better hope they have flash and maybe heal. 

But if you're having a great lane, you also have kill pressure. Slow them into an easy bubble and if you're moderately ahead with an adc to back you up, that's probably either a kill or summoners used. 

Her ulti is absolutely amazing in team fights. It's huge, so it'll likely knock up the entire team and her bubble CAN potentially get multiple people which is likely if they're clumping up and not paying you any mind and happens more often than you might think in a chaotic team fight. (Though getting more than a triple bubble is pretty rare). 

She contributes a decent amount of damage for an enchanter too, especially considering how much utility is in her kit. Literally every single ability in her kit has utility tacked on in some form or another. Q - hard cc, W - heal, E - slow (also great for applying aery shield), R - knock up, heavy slow, doubles passive speed up. 

On top of that, she's great in pretty much any team composition. Bonus points if you have a Yasuo, since her ult AND bubble can enable his ulti, and the fact that her ulti is gonna knock up multiple people in most cases... heh. :) 

And to wrap it all up, Nami isn't a highly contested pick nor is she hated enough to get banned. So, she's easy to one or two trick. And, unlike my other main (Soraka), people don't hate her and respect her so you get a lot less toxicity aimed at you. Which I've gone over before, but I just find it funny that people often respect a Nami more than a Soraka, cause Soraka is actually harder to play imo (her positioning and ranges are more complicated than Nami's imo and she has less play making potential). But I guess it's just that Nami doesn't FEEL that awful to play against, whereas Soraka is obnoxious. :p 

Oh, and also - Nami is very easy to play. She's simple and was the first support I ever picked up and felt comfortable playing. Mechanically, she's very simple. But, her Q requires some practice as it's one of the hardest cc's to land in the game. That's alright though, since it allows you to grow into her as well and feel rewarded for putting time into her. (Also, getting better at maximizing her W bounce mechanic is also rewarding for people who play her a lot). AND SHE'S JUST FUN. She has the ability to make plays and get things happening and can go aggro in lane which is just very fun and satisfying.

So yeah. That's why."
leagueoflegends,fei94yb,t1_feh4zeq,1579133056.0,"Vayne is easy to shut down in lane and has relatively short range for an adc. As long as you position properly against her, she can be dealt with.

That said, it‚Äôs just the meta. These choices are highly influenced by the current meta. Vayne isn‚Äôt a popular pick right now. Some of the champs here are super annoying and it doesn‚Äôt matter how popular they are (ex: Pyke, Morgana - not super popular atm but annoying af) but for the most part the champs listed here are strong meta picks atm that people don‚Äôt like to see.

If this same survey was taken back in a vayne meta, she‚Äôd definitely have made the list."

leagueoflegends,fei3bhh,t3_ep66pa,1579129350.0,"Everything in this video was super exciting! Great job listening to feedback and rolling with it. :D 

My only complaint is that I‚Äôm kind of sad they want to replace lunar revel skins with mecha kingdoms. :( I guess I‚Äôm apparently in the minority here but I adore the lunar revel skins. They‚Äôre so pretty! Some of them may have a little something off about them but that could have been changed. Example: I think people didn‚Äôt care for vayne‚Äôs skin because of the pig. I get it, year of the pig. But it could have just been a red and golden theme and worked just as well with maybe a cute pig in the recall. The weapon was meh. The rest of the skin was beautiful. 

I personally hate the mecha kingdom skins. They make it hard to tell which champ is which. They all kinda look the same to me. Unless you really like those mecha anime shows, you probably aren‚Äôt gonna be a huge fan either so I‚Äôm kind of surprised if they already have data saying people love it.

And lastly: event passes being tied to emotes and other rewards. Okay. So I think this was a mistake. Locking emotes and wards behind buying the pass is bullshit. The emotes are one of the best things to spend your points on if you didn‚Äôt buy the pass and don‚Äôt care about chromas. 

Solution: make those available in the shop but also give them ‚Äúfor free‚Äù as rewards if you buy the pass. So, in the shop it‚Äôll just say ‚Äúowned‚Äù if you bought the pass but be available for those who didn‚Äôt buy the pass. OR, give more tokens from the pass. I think if you bought the pass, you should be able to afford everything in the event shop or at the very least, most things. I bought the event pass for night and dawn and I was able to buy: prestige points, 1 chroma, 2 orbs (so, 3 chromas if I wanted to). The trouble is, by just giving me the emotes and ward skins, if I didn‚Äôt want the chromas, I had nothing else to buy (but that‚Äôs ok because orbs are always an option, or blue essence. Orange essence would also be cool to add in as an option). But also, if I wanted to buy everything, I couldn‚Äôt have done so. Frustrating imo."
SorakaMains,fei1gr6,t1_fehztp0,1579128211.0,"Oh, definitely. Not every support wants to buy athenes so they can‚Äôt decide the power of it based off of that. (That would be like deciding every champs heal power based on the assumption that people will buy spirit visage or something). I was just pointing it out because I think some people may have overlooked it and it‚Äôs a cool interaction. 

But yeah, I also always took coin on Soraka before they dropped it. I actually take relic on her now most of the time because I prefer to finish the quest very quickly (even if it‚Äôs a rough lane). But with the mana regen back on I‚Äôm a bit more tempted to go spellthiefs. ü§î But I regret it every time I have one of those games. You know the ones. Where our jungle is always top for some reason, theirs is always bot. They get all the dragons and constantly pressure bot, their midlaner roams a lot (even if they‚Äôre doing poorly) and the few times our jungle did come down, they inted kills to the enemy adc. Ah..."
SorakaMains,fehzh59,t1_fehs8d1,1579127012.0,"Yeah, I agree on that. Even if it gives no cdr until tier 3, that would be fine by me. I‚Äôd just like the option to buy protective boots and still hit the cdr cap. Or to get more benefit from transcendence. 

Especially since not only did they nerf the AP on it but they were also considering to give us more gold with it too (I think it was 250 - 350 more gold but I don‚Äôt remember. It was on the pbe though), so clearly they felt there was room for more strength. That didn‚Äôt go through, and that‚Äôs fine. But I‚Äôd just love that cdr back. 

But then again... sneaky side note is that the item didn‚Äôt actually lose any AP if you buy athenes. It lost 20 AP which you gain back through the regen and athenes passive. :p"
nunumains,fehxp4o,t1_feh209q,1579125949.0,"Mmm, I don‚Äôt think I agree with that mentality. Feast or famine champs are often frustrating to play, especially if you don‚Äôt pop off. 

Even Nunu can be decent from behind. He can provide peel with his cc, builds tank items which are relatively cheap (can even go supportive tank items if he needs) and has security in objective control with his Q if he‚Äôs a lower level than the enemy jungler. 

Knowing how to play well from behind is very important in league and having champs that can still be useful when behind facilitates comebacks. Who really enjoys snowball metas where the game is decided in the first 10 minutes? (And sure, an assassin can get back in the game too if they manage to get a few kills but it‚Äôs much harder and that‚Äôs why many assassins tend to rage quit if they have a bad game). 

Anyway, there are definitely repercussions to a support playing poorly. They often dictate the laning phase and if a support does poorly, the adc is probably also behind. Which as we saw in your game, the Jinx wasn‚Äôt doing so great - 1 kill, nearly 50 Cs less than MF. A dead support also means less protection for the team and enables your team to engage and win with a numbers advantage or force objectives."
SorakaMains,fegl4w5,t1_fegb1k7,1579096153.0,"Yeah but in most cases you're only gonna hit the cap anyway. You get 3 items as a support, typically, since you need 3 slots for your support item, boots and pink wards. 30% off most items and then ionian boots to finish it off. If you're gonna drop the pink wards, you could pick up a different boot - or take transcendence to open up the option of other boots. 

It used to be more worth, imo, back when the support item also gave cdr but since that's not the case anymore it's just kind of meh. But like I said, it's just my opinion."
nunumains,fef3sxg,t1_fee7fu4,1579047510.0,"Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, I‚Äôm not trying to be mean or rude but ... 
You‚Äôre only 1 kill up. 3 assists up and about 10 Cs up. I mean, it‚Äôs something but you‚Äôre acting like you were 10 kills up on him. You weren‚Äôt that far ahead of him in reality and I think the bounty system is probably the answer here, especially if one or more of your kills was on someone who wasn‚Äôt worth much gold.

A shut down can be worth 1000 gold in total. If you killed a 0/6 Soraka, she‚Äôs probably worth less than 300. And it looks like Jinx wasn‚Äôt very valuable either. Or syndra."
nunumains,fef36pr,t1_fee98nm,1579047097.0,"If someone has to die, the support is typically the sacrificial lamb. Yes. But it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúno harm, no foul‚Äù. Even if the support isn‚Äôt worth much gold wise, their death is still harmful. One less person on the map means the enemy team can push for an objective and have the upper hand in a fight. The support also provides a lot of utility (usually) and power to their team, so having them out of action can be huge. 

Soraka, for example, can heal a shit ton and keep her team alive. Do you think it‚Äôs gonna be a lot easier to kill her team if she isn‚Äôt alive? Probably. If you kill her instantly in a fight, before she can even ult, that‚Äôs a huge loss for her team. So yeah, she may not be worth much gold but she can still do a lot for her team so it‚Äôs wise to get rid of her if you can. 

Especially with supports, they can often be useful to their team with few or even no items. Unlike, say, an assassin with no items, supports offer a lot even from behind. 

So, no. It‚Äôs not no harm no foul."

leagueoflegends,fef11vc,t1_fedvvnu,1579045667.0,"Fiddle needs a rework. His kit is bad. From the prospective of both the fiddle player and the players going against him. 

But I‚Äôll be lying if I say I‚Äôm not kinda sad. The thing I love about fiddle is how derpy he is. He always makes me laugh. One of my fav videos on YouTube is the fiddlesticks one for all (magikarp used fly‚Äôs video I‚Äôm pretty sure). I‚Äôm not personally a fan of horror genre stuff and I jump scare easily with literally ANYONE suddenly popping out of a bush. I don‚Äôt need this in my life!! XD 

But it does look pretty sick so I can see why so many people are excited for it. 

Kind of a shame though, they always seem to rework a champ right before it finally finds a place in the meta. Volibear was so unused that there was literally no data on him if you checked op.gg - it would actually say ‚ÄúRIP‚Äù. Haha. Now, I see him fairly frequently and he‚Äôs a menace. Actually can carry games. Been seeing fiddle more too, since he is actually a good abuser of alcoves. Plop a control ward in the back and wait to ult. 3 bushes in lane also gives him more places to hide for it too. And his dumb crows give easy spellthiefs procs. 

I have a feeling that new fiddle might not be viable as support anymore though, which is kind of sad for people who enjoy him since he is primarily played support nowadays. 

But overall, I think the change will be good and most will be happy. But like you said, there‚Äôs always gonna be some who hate it."

japanlife,febv4jr,t3_eobpbb,1578963066.0,"Try finding another grocery store or something. A lot of them will have vegetables available without any plastic or packaging. I can always buy onions, carrots, cabbages, cucumbers and even tomatoes without packaging. (Unless you want something like half a cabbage or whatever - then it‚Äôs always wrapped). Sadly green peppers are usually always in a plastic bag here though but sometimes they‚Äôll sell individual ones for pretty cheap on sale days. Every shop is kind of different but just try to find the one which uses the least plastic. This one I go to offers a lot of things without but some things are always in plastic like the peppers and for some reason, celery. But the old shop I went to, celery was always package free as were most things. It was a very cheap store too. I think it was like local produce but meh. 

You might even be able to find a local farmer who sells their produce on the side of the road or whatever if you look around. When I was living in Tokyo, there was a little old lady who sold her veggies right outside her house. Very cheap, fresh and of course - no packaging. 

At the grocery store, always be sure to tell them you don‚Äôt want a bag. If they don‚Äôt charge for the bag, they‚Äôll always try to give you one, even if you obviously have your own already.üôÑ

Other than that, there‚Äôs no much you can do. As for conbini lunches, try buying stuff from the hot counter. Like Karage, corn dogs, etc. they usually give those to you in paper bags instead iirc. (I cook all my own meals so it‚Äôs been awhile but I‚Äôm pretty sure they do).
