This is what all the neckbeards in this thread, who've never used anything other than their cellphone and maybe a webcam, don't get.

I've yet to see anything digital that recreates even scanned Kodachrome, for example, or the delicate tonality of Portra's midtones, or the crispness of Neopan. 

Also, keep in mind that format affects lens rendering - there's a reason why *The Hateful Eight* looks different to anything shot on 35mm, too. The way the lenses render and interact, the depth field, are all different to smaller formats on 70mm."

brisbane,ffyhna8,t1_fftf0pk,1580346648.0,"Short answer: Darwin. 

Goong-Goong was a trained radio repairman for the RAAF in WWII. (Incidentally, according to his old records I found, he wasn't that good at it...but anyway. ""Needs guidance and supervision"", and I was wondering where I got that from.)

He started up a radio repair shop after the war.

Post-war, everyone was of course broke as fuck, especially the station owners who'd had all their cattle used by the Government to feed the war effort. He'd get called out to fix their wirelessessesses. 

He knew that they were broke, but those radios were their only lifeline to the outside world, especially during the Wet when a lot of stations would be completely cut off save for maybe a boat or plane, so he went and fixed them anyway. If you've just come off a horse you'd really need to call the RFDS in ASAP. 

So, he fixed their gear for free, but they paid him in barter. This was things like buffalo horns from buffalo they'd shot, sawfish bills/skulls, and, of course, the aforementioned baby crocs (freshwater, not salt). 

The idea was that he'd raise the crocs up to something that's worth selling, and then flog 'em to a tannery. (This was waaaaaaay before anyone gave a shit about licencing, wildlife preservation, or anything like that.)

'Course, he couldn't really do that, so what he normally did was just find a nice creek on the way home and let the crocs go. 

Not actually as bad a deal as it sounds, because if any poor bastard's done any work for fucking cockies you'd know it's an absolutely a cunt of a job to get them to pay you ANYTHING, let alone at the time the work was fucking done.

Axecraft,ffrsf88,t1_ffp2w1c,1580164789.0,"Yeah, nah. ""Cast Steel"" on a tool simply means the *steel* was cast. Not the chisel or tool itself. 

""Cast Steel"" what they called crucible or open-hearth steel back in the day, and became a mark of quality, when a lot of stuff was still made with cruder steels. ""Cast"" was used because the alloy was able to become fully liquefied in these high-temperate processes to fully infuse with carbon, and thus able to poured into ingot moulds, as opposed to previous processes which was more like soaking wrought iron in some high-carbon medium like pig iron or charcoal, and then beating the shit out of it to distribute the carbon. 

Think of it like the difference between stirring sultanas into a liquid cake batter versus kneading it into a stiff bread dough. Much easier to mix it through the batter instead of the dough. 

The chisel or tool was still forged, either by roll-forging bar stock or ingots, or drop-forging.
