I feel bad for Biden. By all accounts, from people he's worked with through the years, he's a really good human being who has tried to be a stand up guy his whole career, as he went through hell personally. 

I think he genuinely felt his nation hurting and thought this was his time to be a patriot and run for president. On paper he's the most qualified and experienced and he just majorly misread what is needed.

His campaign chose to declare victory early so that going to New Hampshire they would have a victory on which to campaign. Arguably a better showing than anyone expected. He still performed exceedingly well for a mayor of South bend Indiana, and although I'm not a Pete supporter, unless he is the eventual nominee, I don't think that this sinks his campaign in any way.

What pregnant women don't appreciate is being treated like a child that is irresponsible, when some of us do exhaustive research on how to be responsible and mitigate risks. I never went on anecdotal evidence, I actually read whatever randomized studies were done on the subjects in question. 

If you were to really talk to a doctor about alcohol during pregnancy, they would agree that a small glass of wine with a meal is fine and would not be metabolized through the placenta to the fetus. They don't advise that, because on average people underestimate the amount that they're drinking. So to be safe, albeit patronizing, doctors tell women that no amount of alcohol is safe. People take this as gospel without looking further into it, when in reality some, but not too much, is perfectly fine. 

There were times when hormones made sleeping impossible and a small glass of wine with dinner helped me unwind and get much needed rest.

You just have to make sure it's from a place that is reliably clean and things are fresh, no supermarket sushi. 

The problem with meat/fish/deli meat when pregnant is the threat of listeria and listeriosis, which can be deadly to a fetus. Really all I stayed away from strictly, was deli meat. It has the most exposure to potential listeria contamination when being sliced (more surface area for bacteria). The thing about listeria, is it's extremely hard to predict where it will appear. Hell, tomatoes and lettuce have been recalled for listeria and e.coli. 

In short, cook your yolks over medium, cook your steak medium, eat good sushi that isn't high in mercury, and stay away from deli meat, particularly turkey, and have a glass of wine or beer with dinner every now and again if you like. Don't be a paranoid headcase, and your baby will be fine.

Edit: To add to this list and upset the patronizing and judgemental... If you have pregnancy insomnia or worse, crippling migraines, and you can stomach it, have yourself a cup of coffee. Less than 400mg of caffeine per day is safe and you won't reach that until 4 cups. :)"
