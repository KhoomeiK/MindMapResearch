On the flip side of that, if you're a carry player and your support isn't god tier doing this for you, just buy plenty of regen yourself. 

It is W-I-L-D how often you can win bad lane match ups just because you keep ferrying out regen when the enemy doesn't. Sure, you may delay that first wraith band or finishing up your treads by a bit, but if you're getting a steady stream of regen and the enemy isn't, you will eventually start either getting kills or push them out of lane. 

That advantage will translate into the early/mid part of the game where you'll have no problem making up any lost ground from the gold you spent on regen."

AskReddit,ffxfgpe,t3_evnzey,1580324076.0,"#People need to be less tribal about beliefs. 

Yeah, we all want to belong. But when good information suggests we're wrong about something, and that information threatens our identity or the identity of the tribe we feel belonging to, you have gotta develop the flexibility and self confidence to be okay with being wrong and changing your mind. If your whole identity crumbles because something you and your tribe believe in turns out to be wrong, then you've based your sense of identity too narrowly on being right or belonging to the tribe rather than the things that matter in the long run. 

It's not an inherently bad thing to belong to a tribe. It becomes toxic when you will go to any lengths to protect the tribe and identity you derive from belonging to it, even in the face of facts that indicate you and the tribe are wrong."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffvkap5,t1_ffvhmrv,1580266119.0,"Bro, a public defender/prosecutor would laugh their ass off if they heard you say 11 open cases. Those people can have dockets of hundreds of cases at a time.

And since things move slowly, that’s probably about right for most people. I’m not saying everyone should have that much of a load, but it’s definitely not unusual (or necessarily too much work to do a good job)."

Not all, but most places, the same people do both things and the perception that the public defenders are substandard quality to the ones you pay for is mostly untrue."
