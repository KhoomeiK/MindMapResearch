Benzedrex,ffoo6ot,t3_eu2akw,1580079827.0,"It depends. ""Antidepressants"" in a typical sense means SSRIs or SNRIs. Serotonin releasing agents are quite different.

However, I definitely think SSRIs or SNRIs are worth trying, especially at lower doses. Venlafaxine (SNRI) was the worst drug I have ever ingested, and I was taking a pretty high dose.

As for ADHD meds, maybe look for bupropion instead? It's a Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor.

Dopamine precursors are also good, if you lack them. I am 95% sure I lack them, I would take them if I wasn't a broke motherfucker.

Then you are refusing to understand factual evidence.

You want to continue believing your view, and for you to do so, you must disregard absorption.

Why would you not care about absorption?

Dexcalc doesn't tell you you ""need 470mg to enter 3rd plat"".

It deliberately says you need to ***TAKE*** 470mg to enter 3rd plat.

If you absorbed 470mg, you took 4273mg. Where do you think I'm getting these numbers? It's bioavailability.

You are arguing not against me, but against *the scientific fact that dextromethorphan's bioavailability is ~11%*"
