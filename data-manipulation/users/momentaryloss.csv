TheCircleTV,ffdm4al,t1_ffd3r1b,1579823797.0,"Completely agree, especially about Shubham. His whole schtick is about ""realness""; I expected him to at least acknowledge that Sean revealed herself on her own terms because she wanted to be more genuine, which put her at huge risk for being voted off or ostracized. People in this sub are so convinced Sean was creating a strategy, but like you said, it's just not possible to understand just how hurtful fat-stigma is unless you experience it. Especially considering Sean works in the fashion industry, which is incredibly fat-exclusionary"
TheCircleTV,ffdlqkt,t1_ffdiqv9,1579823561.0,"The body positivity movement is there to try and correct a problem. And just look at how many people mock that movement. It's notable, but it's far from changing society's mind. Even Ed said that he faked his compliment about Sean's real looks. Sean is right that people put down fat people CONSTANTLY just for existing. There's a reason why every plus-size person on this show felt like they would only be liked if they presented themselves as a skinny, conventionally attractive person. Antonio admitted that he wouldn't have liked Karyn or felt like getting to know her if she came into the circle with her real photos. Sean's insecurities are legitimate. There's a reason why lookism is so toxic and why so many people develop eating disorders to try and attain a certain, thin look"
TheCircleTV,ffc9puc,t3_eskryk,1579794738.0,"I felt for Sean. I come from an culture obsessed with thinness; I'm not even that big, but I'm still bigger than other girls in my area. I feel the pressure and anxiety and hurt of being judged and targeted for being bigger. I think Sean was being honest. I can see how it seems like she was playing it up for the cameras, but I really don't think she was. Shubham annoyed me with his response. I felt like he didn't even really try to understand why Sean did what she did; he just jumped into attacking her. His whole ""social media is cancer"" comes across as so much holier-than-thou and I'm tired of it."
TheCircleTV,ffc95nc,t3_es0gm8,1579794384.0,"Shooby was my favorite in the beginning but he started to annoy me after he found out the truth about Sean. Always going on and on about how ""the biggest risk you can take is to be yourself"" bitch...... pick a different record to play, you sound broken. I really felt for Sean and it irritated me that he didn't seem to try and understand her anxiety about coming in as a bigger woman."
thebachelor,ff9120h,t3_erkmuk,1579702156.0,Kelsey is by FAR the most annoying contestant this season....her conversation with Hannah Ann episode 3 had my head spinning
thebachelor,ff7ze53,t1_ff78xyf,1579662014.0,"I agree! Honestly I feel like it's because Nicole was shaming Angela for being thin, and Sydney shamed Alayah for being fat (even though Alayah is tiiiiiiiny)"
thebachelor,ff7xo7s,t3_es3szt,1579660813.0,I actually love that he brings Alayah back. I love that he's playing by his own rules; made me respect him and I felt like I saw his actual personality for once
Hozier,fenxl1e,t3_epxtlv,1579292308.0,"Would That I. I am 23 years old and this is the first song in my life to have made me *feel* something. I've always like music, but music has never given me emotions before this. Something about it. The way he sings the bridge makes me feel like I'm being lifted up by my stomach and carried off over mountains, trusting his voice not to drop me. The lyrics hypnotize me. I burn too"

AskMen,fejrgar,t3_epfb2w,1579183996.0,"I met him my third year of college; I opened up and told him I took a medical leave my freshman year of college for depression, anxiety, and eating disorder treatment. I was in recovery for all 3, but he was raised to believe depression was a disease that would ruin not only the life of the person afflicted, but also the lives of those around that person. He didn't trust that I was truly in recovery and knew how to manage my symptoms, so we broke it off. 
At the time I chalked it up to his upbringing, and tried not to take it too personally. Less than a year later, he began dating a girl with debilitating depression. We were still friends and he confided in me a lot; the relationship was toxic and he wasn't happy. It's not fair of me to feel this way, but when I first found out about their relationship, it felt like a punch to the gut. I was crazy about him and thought it was just my mental illness that he couldn't handle. Turns out, he could handle mental illness; it was just me he couldn't take, and my mental illness was the excuse. I feel like a baby for being so hurt about it  though."
thebachelor,fej0ar8,t3_ep4gwp,1579152373.0,"I mean. It's pretty similar to ""I hear what you're saying"", which people often say in confrontations like this. ""I acknowledge your feelings"" sounds a little more formal and that makes it sound a little odd I guess but I don't really see the issue tbh"
thebachelor,fej00r8,t3_ep4vem,1579152116.0,"I mean yeah she's probably truly insecure, but she's also immature and annoying as hell with the way she reacted when she lost the talent show. That was such a turn-off"
thebachelor,feiz3vh,t3_epci0n,1579151311.0,"Almost all fashion is fast fashion, even the pricier stuff. Buying secondhand or buying from businesses that consciously strive to produce clothing with a small environmental footprint are really the only ways to avoid it"
thebachelor,feft2p7,t1_feenxmi,1579064356.0,"Yeah but then why include a Confederate
Flag in the design? He knows what he was signaling and she should have too"
thebachelor,fefmm05,t1_fefcqg5,1579059600.0,"I'm not sure how much heat Hannah Ann is getting in other social media platforms, but there have been multiple threads on this subreddit discussing how unlikable Hannah Ann is, and how much they dislike her after this episode"
thebachelor,fefivtm,t3_eovkgo,1579057257.0,"I think the most obvious frontrunners right now (according to my unspoiled watch-party) are Hannah Ann, Madison, Kelley, Victoria F, and Mykenna. I know this is UO but this week's episode made me like Hannah Ann a LOT more than last week. I feel bad for her for the Kelsey situation and I don't think it was wrong of her to talk to Peter about it."
thebachelor,fefi8zc,t1_fefgk6t,1579056874.0,"Yes the first thing I do after being led to a location (probably by my producer) and told ""here is your champagne"" is to closely read the label and think about which brands of champagne ABC would buy for my fireside chat. Lmao. Bruh it's not that deep she probably just didn't look at the label or bottle, especially since Peter was the one who opened it anyway."
thebachelor,feffalb,t1_fee92xs,1579055102.0,"She still lives at home, how bougie do you think she is? Sure she's a model, but do you really think that means she has tons of exposure to expensive champagne and would recognize a bottle of Dom at a glance?"
thebachelor,fefdmgo,t1_fef920p,1579054060.0,"On one hand I understand why being robotic and monotone can come off as unlikable, but on the other hand, I commend her for having that delivery when she spoke to Kelsey. I think she tried to maintain a stoic expression and voice to try and refrain from becoming overly emotional. I do the same thing. I would definitely not call her unkind; I've seen nothing that would suggest she is a genuinely malicious person tbh. A little over-eager maybe, but I far prefer a ""hey can I steal you for a sec?"" over someone, say, throwing paper airplanes at you to try and get you to leave."
thebachelor,fefce7n,t3_eopxmv,1579053265.0,I think it's interesting that people find her unlikable because she's lowkey my favorite right now lol. I really disliked her after episode 1 but episode 2.....I'm very pro-Hannah lmao

dogs,febwodm,t1_febw02b,1578963576.0,"Thank you for this, especially for pointing out it's unlikely that my dog would be seriously injured. I often forget about that, and just immediately jump to the fear that he would get severely hurt. Thank you for the advice!"
