witchcraft,ffj8eoq,t3_etr3u8,1579992911.0,"All religions are similar in so many ways. They all originate from the same few stories, they’re just tweaked. If you watch Zeitgeist - a 3hr film, it’s very interesting. It may not all be true, but it’s very convenient not to be. It goes on to say about how religion actually ties in with the movements of the sun, the Bible and many other religions books mention “light” and “dark”, the sun helps crops grow, but the dark and cold kills them, I could go on but it’s better to watch it.
I say to people, my witchcraft is simply a way to connect with the Universe. Christians pray to God for help, I pray to the Universe."
