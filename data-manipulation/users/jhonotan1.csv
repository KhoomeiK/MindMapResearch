holdmycosmo,ffnm0hu,t1_ffnk3l9,1580067668.0,"The slit in her dress was probably flapping her vag around, whereas the other chick was wearing something that was wearing something ever-so-slightly more practical."
trashy,ffnhnp6,t1_ffn3dp9,1580066108.0,"Nothing more infuriating than a condescending ""hun""."
entwives,ffmy6jo,t1_ffmroaa,1580060137.0,"That's what I do! I made a sploof out of a toilet paper tube, some paper towels stuffed inside, and a dryer sheet rubber banded to the end. That, along with the dry herb vape, leaves no smell at all!"
insaneparents,ffmv1n0,t3_eu93us,1580059270.0,">nephews are autism

Well, it's simple. Just get rid of her nephews, and we'll eradicate autism!"
Parenting,ffml9yu,t1_ffm448c,1580056206.0,"We've had a cold since school started, peppered with other illnesses. I'm so fucking over it."
beyondthebump,ffkbocu,t3_ettrbw,1580020140.0,"Nope! I try to be in bed no later than 11, but lately it's been getting later and later...

My husband just went back to graveyard shift, so I try to stay up until he leaves at 11:15 or so, which means I get my second wind and stay up too late."
entwives,ffjs0ig,t3_etxck0,1580005370.0,"Yay!! That's amazing!

I waited to even try it until it was legal in my state. So glad we were some of the first states, because it's been an amazing experience so far. I'm such a rule-follower that I could never be comfortable using it illegally!"
entwives,ffjrua0,t1_ffjlz97,1580005245.0,"I'm in a 100% green state and I can't smoke in my rental at all. Granted, that's including cigarettes, but I can't even go in my backyard and smoke. It's super lame.

Thankfully, I have a dry herb vape that barely has any smell, and I use a homemade sploof in my garage, so no one knows!"
cringe,ffjb1s3,t1_ffj8rb4,1579994548.0,"I haven't seen any of their videos, just clips here and there, but seeing that little boy be tormented makes me want to cry. Those are his *parents*, the two people in the whole world who are supposed to protect him and make him feel safe. I couldn't imagine torturing my children to the point of hysterics and finding it remotely funny.

Pranks are only funny when EVERYONE gets to laugh. This isn't a prank, this is abuse."
AdviceAnimals,ffio1h5,t1_ffin8re,1579978483.0,You underestimate my sneakiness...
cringe,ffictid,t1_ffibdsv,1579970819.0,"Also, copious amounts of therapy. That kid with the glasses apparently got singled out and picked on relentlessly. I read somewhere that the older kids would join in on the ""pranks"" against him at first, but then they all started sticking together against the parents.

I've never watched their videos, apart from a few clips here and there, but I read about the drama while it unfolded. I think just the younger two kids got taken away, and one of the older boys turned out just like his dad. It was so sad."
cringe,ffiad5x,t1_ffh1nt5,1579969137.0,They're no longer YouTubers and they got some of their kids taken away (that boy was one of them). They've basically lost everything.
AdviceAnimals,ffi9enk,t1_ffi4v9g,1579968463.0,"Well, my role as the stay-at-home mom to our kids is probably a lot different than yours, so I just deal with it. He works really hard so that I can be home, so that's kind of my job.

THAT BEING SAID...my strategy is to go through the house throughout the day and pick up/put things away. I have him help with the last sweep before bed, and on his days off, he helps out with the housework. I do have to keep reminding him that there's not a magical fairy godmother who comes in and tidies up after him!"
AdviceAnimals,ffi1b82,t1_ffhyg3w,1579962092.0,"Lol, sorry. I got sick of reading all the wife hate, so I had to throw in my experience!

I'm also kind of messy when it comes to my bedroom and bathroom, but my husband always out messes me!"
AdviceAnimals,ffheoh3,t3_etj86p,1579932139.0,"My husband is a fucking slob. He leaves crumbs or drips or blobs wherever he prepares food, cabinets open, shoes everywhere, junk mail, half drunk coffee cups...I would love for him to take the kids away for a few days so I could know what it's like to live in a clean house."
trashy,fffi96l,t1_ffec6he,1579884540.0,"I was a teller for years, and that makes me so sad. I loved my job, and the interactions I had with people had a lot to do with that.

You know who were some of the nicest? People who didn't have a lot of money. You know the type to be rude almost 100% of the time? Rich people."
videos,ffdtbuz,t1_ffd0ola,1579828412.0,"I used to work at a hospital in the US, and this was incredibly common. I worked in the nursing administration department, and often the execs, or even nurse managers, would be unreachable when we reached capacity, then they'd come back and discipline anyone who was responsible for making a decision that they wouldn't have approved of. It's 100% bullshit."

shittyfoodporn,ffaa2od,t1_ff9kbp1,1579730835.0,Trés appropriée.
iamverybadass,ffa9uu9,t3_esep6r,1579730710.0,"Man, I feel physco after reading this...

Also, why do trashy people idolize the Joker and Harley Quinn?? They're so toxic and abusive. That's not the kind of relationship is ever want to be in."
insaneparents,ffa8tkh,t1_ff9ehhi,1579730123.0,"Nope. It's real. Maybe it started as a joke, but most women who share it (usually from their joint Facebook pages with their husbands) are 100% serious from what I've seen.

Bonus points if their son isn't even close to dating age."
trashy,ffa7ovb,t1_ff9t4dn,1579729492.0,My husband had a RAV4 that blew a head gasket. We only had three more payments on it before we owned it! I was so sad.
trashy,ff9lu8o,t1_ff8po9t,1579715710.0,"I also have depression and anxiety. On days where I feel like not functioning, I feel immensely better when I can drag myself off the couch for 10 minutes and tidy up. I tell myself if I can make it 10 minutes, then I can go back to being useless guilt-free. Most of the time, once I'm going I can keep it up for a while.

It's so hard, but part of being a real grown up is the ability to put your responsibilities over your feelings. Trust me, I know it's hard because I've been there so many times."
Parenting,ff9ks7y,t3_esbqv6,1579715090.0,"My 5yo loves cars, Legos, action figures, costumes, stuffed animals, and pretty much anything that allows him to play pretend (he loves reenacting his favorite movies).

He also loves playing with his sister's dolls and her play kitchen. I wouldn't be too concerned, if I were you. Kids that age are still in the mindset of playing with just about anything."
trashy,ff9ibtg,t1_ff9hgnk,1579713631.0,"It broke down, and would cost more than it was worth. I don't know the details of what happened, though. I do know it sat in their driveway for about a year after I sold it to him and didn't even get started, so that probably played into it."
insaneparents,ff9fow6,t3_es9noj,1579712021.0,"I read that as ""vacationing with newborns"" at first and was extremely confused.

Clearly, I've been vaccinated."
