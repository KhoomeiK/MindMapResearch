AskReddit,ffm54oz,t1_ffjtrew,1580048698.0,"Absolutely agree!  

As somebody who is at a director level in IT, and who still does full stack development on the side, I can say - without a doubt - that the best PMs have a bit of a technical background.   

There is nothing worst than a PM who is constantly asking “why can’t you just ______” but has absolutely no fucking clue what they’re talking about.   It’s infuriating to a dev team.

Or a PM takes your accurate estimates, and cuts them in half before they present them to upper management, because “development  shouldn’t take that long, I’ve seen them do stuff like this faster”.

I’ve had PMs do both of these to me back when I was a senior full stack developer.  I could come up with a hundred more examples, but the point is: PMs with at least a little technical credibility, are just better IT PMs/SMs.   

I’m sure people will say:  What about those times when you have a VERY technical person who wishes they were still in a technical role, but for some reason are in the role of PM/SM?  Yes, they can also be a pain in the ass by trying to do talks they appoint, but they are usually corrected much more easily with a single comment in their 1:1, like:  “You’re the scrum master.  I don’t want you doing code changes.  Be sure to leave that to to the developers.”   Then you just send them on a scrum master refresher course."

I put in a single Airpod, turn on a book, and set a 15 to 30 minute sleep timer.

Eventually you drift off and fall asleep.
