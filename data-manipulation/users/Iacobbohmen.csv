hotsauce,ffa6fz5,t3_esidac,1579728799.0,"Why don’t you keep control of the ingredients and make your own? Its so easy, you dont have to necessarily ferment it, just quick boil (10 mins) some fresh chopped chillies of your choice, onions, garlic and whatever you fancy like pineapple or else, add spices, salt, filter it then whizz with vinegar and you’re done!

CasualUK,ffa2n8q,t3_eshyd0,1579726657.0,"I really like fentiman’s selection, specially the victorian lemonade- not overly sweet- otherwise there is a definite trend in non alcoholic gins ( I heard the Ceder’s wasnt bad) you can also try to make your own ginger beer its actually is easier than it seems lots of how to’s available on youtube with this ferment yourself trend !"

gardening,fem7xbd,t1_fem5ybf,1579242984.0,"After the germination/true leaves I kept the vines busy with upright chopsticks first then transferred to slightly larger pots using longer support sticks and little ties to keep them uprights. As they grew I transferred them in ikea transparent plastic crates to keep them in moist environment then moved the crate in my greenhouse when the weather permitted to acclimate - from there I planted them and let the vine outgrew the support. For transplant I just avoided letting them getting rootbound, I also tried to never touch the roots, feather fingers :)"

Dogtraining,fefdsp2,t1_fefcl02,1579054172.0,"If you start scheduling meals I would suggest to do so for all your dogs if possible and separate them to avoid food aggression- chicken meat is perfect if you boil it and give it in chunks (no boiled bones) - sausage is, for me, super rare high value ‘recall worthy’ treat as its usually very fatty and salty. I would say use one sausage a week in little tiny chunks or if its hot dog stuff (a little less fat) maybe a couple hot dogs a week max. As for bacon, its usually cured so too salty and fatty, so I personally wouldnt use it- 
I tend to use different lean meats and fish (pollock is cheap, salmon) you can slow cook in the oven at low temp till it dries or theres also[this treat reciepe you can try ](https://youtu.be/5rVgHLnt4W0)  tuna & cheese bake"

Dogtraining,fefbq2g,t1_fefb52e,1579052819.0,"I think that might be it, if shes able to eat anytime she wants she wont be interested in treats or else- my advice would be to give more structure to her meals times (work on a nice sit and stay + bowl take out to prevent resource guarding given shes living with other dogs) in a morning and evening meals and work with her when shes a little hungry with high value treats - ive yet to see a dog with meal times that resists cooked steak ! ;)"
