aww,ff3cmnv,t1_ff3b286,1579538490.0,"I’m not convinced. The pit bull that terrorized me as a child was “sweet as pie” to everyone except two people (me, age 11, and an elderly indian woman) and a dog (a little Jack Russell). The dog was by all accounts well-trainer and behaved decently to all except us three. 

But when she saw me, my elderly neighbor, or that Jack Russel, it’s like a switch would flip in her head. Instantly, she would drop the “family dog” aspect and enter full-on threat-neutralization mode. I was riding a bicycle maybe 49 yards away when she first tore free of her master’s leash and barreled towards me in a whirlwind of snarling teeth. It was traumatic. Luckily, I escaped. 

More traumatic was the fact that, as the victim of this attack, I was blamed for it. An 11-year-old riding a bicycle half a block down the street was treated like an instigator, as if something was wrong with me for making the dog snap. I learned that year that people do not treat other people equally. An ill-tempered dog is an adequate arbiter of the moral character of a child.

Other friends of mine had similar experiences as a child. When I found /r/banpitbulls , the statistics and anecdotes there made me feel less alone in this experience. I realized that hundreds of Americans every year are victims of pit aggression. I escaped physical harm, making me one of the lucky ones. But I cannot condone the propagation and perfusion of a breed of dog which leaves toddlers permanently disfigured and accounts for ~70% of the annual body count by dogs in the US. 

If you have a conscience, reconsider you position on pit bulls. Even if you believe that the outcome depends on the practices of the owner, you must then acknowledge that the rate of pitbull mishandling is too damn high. If a car was this easy to mishandle, then it would be banned. Pit bulls are not a safe or responsible choice of pet for the vast majority of dog owners."
aww,ff3aeit,t1_ff38tip,1579537357.0,"Several. One, raised in a loving home, used to chase my on my bike when i was a kid. One day, I was on foot, and she caught up to me, and pounced on me. I had to push her face away from mine, and then beat her away with a stick lying near me on the ground. I ran, and she pursued me, so I ran into a neighbor’s house to escape. Over the next four years, this dog held a vendetta against myself, an elderly neighbor of mine, and a little Jack Russell terrier who lived down the block. None of us provoked her, but anytime she saw us, she would strain at her leash, and snarl at us. 

This was bad enough, but soon, I learned that there were social consequences to being a pit bull’s preferred target. The family with the dog refused to deal with it. To them, she was just a sweet family pet. My family was ostracized from neighborhood functions until the dog died (of natural causes), because nobody wanted an incident. But that meant that a family of four was forced out of its community so that nobody would violate the “safe space” of the wittle pibble.  The dog had become the arbiter of social status. 

Another neighbor of mine rescued a pitbull from the pound. Within a month, it mauled a different neighborhood dog (which thankfully lived).  These owners, not wanting to repeat the selfish mistake of the aforementioned neighbors, promptly had the offending dog euthanized. End-of-story. They pulled the dog out of circulation, removing the hazard to society. Not long after, my HOA institutes a ban on pit bulls (though they allowed the first pit I talked about to be grandfathered in). Banning pit bulls is the only responsible choice. These dogs are a menace to society. 

If you’d like statistics on pit bull mauling rates, news articles about pit bull attacks, and resources to help advocate pit bull control in your community, head over to /r/banpitbulls .

If you disagree with what I’ve said here, remember that adopting a pit bull is like buying a gun which you can’t control. You’ve put human lives at risk in pursuit of your vain pleasures."

This is the /r/aww thread where shit’s going down (mostly my comment karma lol)"
aww,ff38a7e,t1_ff36jbi,1579536047.0,"Reddit and the internet’s pit bull fetish is due in part to the fact that no-kill shelters are swamped with these violent dogs, and need to rehome them quickly to increase turnover rate. They sanitize the personal history of these animals to cover up previous violent incidents, and then market the shit out of them online. The pit bull has become one of the internet’s favorite dogs, in stark contrast to the ever-expanding body of evidence which shows that pit bulls are disproportionately harmful to humans compared to other dog breeds. 

If you own a pit, you may wake up one morning to discover that your wittle pibble fancied your family jewels for a midnight snack. He may have been a “sweet angel” until a child or other dog “provoked his anxiety,” and he snapped. Remember in this moment that you are putting the life of a dog (the violent product of centuries of husbandry) above the safety of yourself and your kin. Beware the crocodile’s smile. To him, you are just a source of food.

Animals aren’t people. There’s no reason to pretend that nurture can somehow correct the animal’s violent nature. For the sake of human children, all pitbulls must be eradicated, as has been done in other, more sensible nations. 

As far as the mode of euthanasia, you really can’t beat a headshot with a handgun. It’s quick and painless for the animal, and deeply satisfying for the human delivering justice on a rogue wing of our most servile creation."
