I need to confirm my psychosis isn't as bad as it was a year ago first, which means I'll have to make friends. And I get anxious around people because I fear my psychosis will come back.

socialanxiety,fc5obls,t3_egcail,1577462564.0,"My brain : 

Let's see....no, saying ""Hi!"" makes you sound too interested, but saying ""Hi?"" Makes you sound unintersted. If you're to say ""Hello"" they'll think you're trying to be polite, but if you say ""Hey! What's up!"" You're fucking annoying. Don't say ""Oh hi"" because you sound like you don't want to be a part of the situation, but don't say ""Yeah, what do you want?"" Because you sound demanding. Don't smile and wave, you look retarded. Don't act all hip, you look retarded. Don't even fucking say ""Hello"" in another language asshole, no one gives a shit"
socialanxiety,fc2tvas,t3_efvaae,1577373891.0,"I'll be working a part-time, non-paid internship and am very nervous. My part-time job didn't help but that was because my boss was an ungrateful, assholic piece of shit (I quit a year ago so I'm okay saying this. They cannot fire me if I quit a year ago). I was paid less just 20 cents above minimum wage, and my coworker IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT made almost $10 an hour while I'm making like $7.75 or $7.80 an hour, and I've been working there for four or five years. My boss lied to me about a raise, then kept telling me how shitty of a worker I was. Needless to say I quit out of spite because I was tired of being treated worse than the rainy day mats. 

Now I'm anxious because I hope this doesn't happen again. I worked with my high school's IT department in the 12th grade and is why I want to be a high school IT, I'm familiar with that environment and know that my ""boss"" is somewhere else at the board of education slaving behind a desk dealing with other issues and that it would just be me and maybe one other person or a student. So that sounds more appealing than working somewhere where I could be dragged across the floor...like the rainy day mats. 

I would say be happy until you start comparing your time there to some inanimate object that is related to company policy, like rainy day mats. When you compare yourself to the mats, you know you've got it bad."
