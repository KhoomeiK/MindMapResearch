bipolar,fdnlilk,t1_fdnkl0x,1578588307.0,"I haven't but my Mom deals with it too. They don't give the fasting glucose test enough time for her because she'll feel fine and then right when she gets home from the doctor she'll be nearly passing out. Plus if it's an issue idk what they would do about it other than telling me to eat high fat/protein foods.

Mentally, I just have anxiety about so many things. I constantly worry about everything, I'm triggered by so much, work, driving, going to the store lol. My mind races 24/7. I have insomnia. My heart rate is usually around 90 bpm, occasionally over 100. Mentally I think my generalized anxiety has gotten a bit worse but it's hard to tell because it's always been bad even when I was a kid. I think my anxiety, being in constant fight or flight mode may contribute to hypoglycemia.

Btw, it might go differently for you but when my doctor put me on Wellbutrin my adrenaline was insane and I couldn't function my anxiety was so bad. But... occasionally for some people it may help. It did give me energy lol. Some say it helps social anxiety but it was the opposite for me."

cats,fdnip8k,t3_em8mwj,1578586632.0,Pretty kitty. A fluffy cloud. Cute little pink nose.
cats,fdnik3x,t3_em9sjk,1578586547.0,I have a kitty that looks similar but with green eyes. She got out and ran away for a week or so. We had to trap her to get her back inside... she's our only unspayed cat (we were giving it time for a good reason) and was running around with two boys... we saw their eyes side by side at night. But she's not preggers! Getting her spayed soon haha.
Anxiety,fdnehmx,t3_em0e7a,1578584084.0,I need a reminder to stop chewing my lip and cheeks off.
