shroomers,ffanmex,t1_ffaapys,1579740182.0,"I cant figure out ""where"" to start, there's too many different teks.  I haven't tried again for years but I want to give it another go.  My depression is treatment resistant.  I've had it most of my life.  Nothing they've ever given me has helped so I decided to try to help myself.  I tried years ago but kept losing it to contamination."

shroomers,fenewiv,t3_epx61b,1579283208.0,"There are so many teks, I don't know where to start.  I guess it doesn't matter as I think I bought spores from someone that isn't going to send them.  I know, I should have went to trusted venders list on Shroomery.  You live- you learn, unfortunately it usually means you get screwed.  These jars look nice."

funny,fejymbn,t1_fejupip,1579188812.0,"It used to be like that, I really thought it was a deal.  If they were late they made up for it without even asking.  But this last year it's 9 out of 10 late, sometimes by 4 days.  I realize I live in a rural area but I buy Prime just for the free shipping.  The last time I suggested some kind of ""compensation"" I was told by the associate that ""was not Amazon policy.""  So I quit after almost 20 years shopping there.  I guess Bezos has enough money."

funny,fejpm1d,t1_fejob7h,1579182580.0,"I asked, they said no.  Prime has gotten much stingier.  I canceled my Prime and I won't go back.  Almost every order was late by two days.  I'm sure I'm not the only one."
borderlands3,fejo15m,t1_feiszd9,1579181256.0,So when you beat the game you start a new game?  Thank you for explaining that.
borderlands3,feil4l2,t3_ep0y73,1579141065.0,"Can you farm without finishing the game?  Every time I go back to previous bosses they are like 20 levels under me and the loot is worthless.  What am I missing?  I know this probably sounds stupid but I've always played offline and I can't ask anyone else.  Do you finish the game, start a new game and the bosses move up to your level?  Or is that where UVHM comes in?  I'm at the last boss (T think) and just made level 50."
shroomers,feh9183,t3_eouucg,1579111656.0,"That's awesome!  I'm not sure I'll ever get started.  I paid for spores last week and never heard anything about shipping, then found out yesterday they had some kind of problem and not to expect shipment for 10 business days.  starting to really wonder..."
AshenTheGame,feh8tbd,t3_ep5evp,1579111524.0,"Okay, that sucks. I'm having a hard enough time with this game, I'm afraid if that happened I would never start again.  Loved the idea of another ""souls"" like game but I'm disappointed at how hard this is to get into.  A bow would have really been welcome in my opinion."
