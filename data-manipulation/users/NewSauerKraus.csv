dndmemes,ffe8xyc,t1_ffci313,1579839953.0,"It’s a double cross. You do a short campaign where the party is a squad of squires / sidekicks to the Hero of the Kingdom. Said hero valiantly sacrifices his self to save the kingdom. This leads into a long campaign where the party fights to save the world (rest of the kingdoms) and also avenge the death of their friend.

The NPC is just plot hook personified. The party still runs the shots obviously. It’s just that the “clues” they have been following are a legendary hero.

And sure, the NPC takes all the glory in the small fiefdom of tutorial island. But the players pull through to the very end and when the statues of the world’s heroes are built... every member of the party stands together, even the NPC who gave his life so that the party could push on."

PUBATTLEGROUNDS,ffbk17c,t1_ffa8apk,1579768987.0,I wouldn’t worry about it. Most people who get “unfairly banned” are either lying or using some cheats that they thought would not get caught because it was never called out specifically in patch notes. So they write out a sob story thinking they can appeal it because there was no way the devs could have caught them. It must have been a coincidence.

ThatsInsane,fetrc4p,t1_fesqcfi,1579378830.0,Most trees survive wildfires even without that. Annual fires only have a limited amount of fuel. It burns quick and doesn’t harm the trees. The problem is preventing those annual fires until so much fuel is built up that it does become an actual danger.

The reintroduction of predators to control herbivores is allowing new growth in forests. And intentional burning is removing all the built up fuel from the classic “never allow a forest fire” policy. Regular burning of forests is safe for the trees because there is not enough fuel to hurt them. But preventing regular fires was building up decades of dead trees and brush that once lit ended with everything being destroyed over thousands of acres."
ThatsInsane,fetjvru,t1_fesmycd,1579376146.0,Grazing is probably the biggest thing. Young trees are very vulnerable to being eaten. That’s why when wolves were hunted to extinction in some places the deer population went way up and ate all the little trees along the edge of rivers. The older trees eventually died out and without new trees to hold the dirt in place now the rivers have eroded.
