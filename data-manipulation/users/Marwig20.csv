ShitAmericansSay,fedo22n,t1_fednwcz,1579016160.0,He wouldn’t be in AP. AP doesn’t support a federal jobs guarantee and other similar programs. They agree on much but Bernie goes much further

ShitAmericansSay,fednlab,t1_fedn3yr,1579015860.0,Your claim was that “lots of countries have had and have such programs” your evidence was 4 examples. Those 4 examples do not prove that “lots of countries” have done or have a jobs guarantee program
ShitAmericansSay,fedmtg9,t1_fedkpy6,1579015359.0,"Wait... do you not understand what a federal jobs guarantee is?

ShitAmericansSay,fedkac3,t1_fedjrlm,1579013650.0,Admit that you just assume everything Bernie says is centrist in the rest of the world. Your examples are basically **all** the instances of a jobs **guarantee**

ElizabethWarren,fed73mk,t1_febw19n,1579001995.0,From what we know he didn’t say a woman shouldn’t be able to win. That would actually be sexist. Saying a woman can’t win is a political judgement not a moral or ethical one
