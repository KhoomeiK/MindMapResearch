The edit you added especially interests me, that you felt compelled to dance with him but he told you to stay in bed. Maybe a creature from another dimension? A fairy? An alien? Either way, I’m glad he was apparently no threat to you or your sister. Very interesting as well (if it was indeed Obeskin your sister was playing with too), that he stuck around your family specifically. Sorry for rambling with nothing really to add, but this story really sticks out to me for a reason I can’t really explain lol. Thanks for sharing!"
cats,femgeyq,t3_epxhjg,1579254176.0,"Cats must have a really high tolerance for heat or something. My girl is always laying so close to the fireplace that I’m sure it must be too hot, but she never seems to be in any discomfort. She even gets cranky when I pick her up and set her back a bit, and just goes right to where she was before lol. What the hell are cats"
