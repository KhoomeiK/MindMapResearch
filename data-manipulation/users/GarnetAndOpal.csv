DeadBedroomsMD,ffgbu28,t3_etguu3,1579902789.0,"My experience in a medically-related DB is that 1) communication is very important, and 2) other intimacy **must** continue.  The communication should be frequent and honest.  If you let him know that the desire is still there, he might not feel as ""rejected"".  Let him know it is not just one person suffering from the fallout - there are two.  As for intimacy, all the hugging and kissing, etc., really need to happen.  The worst thing is to withdraw, because then the feelings of rejection are worse.  That leads to depression or anger.  The only caveat is that the intimacy can't look like it is trying to lead into sex.  The intimacy is for the sake of intimacy itself.  We all crave human touch.  Just don't let yourself (or him) try to make the ""touching"" into ""feeling up"".

Good luck.  I'm sorry it will be a long slow path to recovery - but it will be worth any gains you make."

The truth was that he didn't want to work.  He also didn't want me.  This is where our stories differ.  My ex wasn't addicted.  He was closeted.

I divorced him a couple months after our son was born.  I probably should have filed sooner, or not married him in the first place.

He would chase the Spitz one way until they reached the end of the alley, and then they would change roles and the Spitz would chase him back the other way.
