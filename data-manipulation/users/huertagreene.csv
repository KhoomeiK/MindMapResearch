AskReddit,ffekpr4,t3_et75vo,1579852109.0,"From second grade, he and I were friends, buddies. The love we shared was for music.  All thru school, we sat together, hung out after school, listening to his favorite Moody Blues, mine, Hendrix and Lennon.  After high school we drifted away and I looked for him everywhere. Then came Facebook!  We found each other again!  He called me Captain, I called him Bud, still.  Then I got to know him..  He was racist, a bigot and a Trump supporter to the extreme.  I couldnt deal.  He couldnt either.  I ended blocking him and him, me.  Then he died...heart attack. I miss him."

nba,ff2zott,t3_erdfcp,1579529705.0,PACERS.  Always striving and mostly exciting to me.  Hometown Indiana basketball!  But I love to watch Houston to see James Hardin!  Amazing!  And he never fails to excite the basketball fan in me.
AskReddit,ff2yzay,t3_erdfdn,1579529096.0,"He is smart, quick- witted, successful, has grown responsible, when I thought that might never happen! He sometimes even says ""I love you to me, without me having to say it first! There are many things he does that makes me proud of him.  I love that he is a music fanatic, knowledgable about many artists and genre.  I could go on and on!!"
funny,ff2ylh2,t3_erdfek,1579528754.0,"It's strange to me that I thought at one time. that Chris was the funniest man I had ever heard.  All he had to do was walk on stage and I was rollin'!  But in a few short years, his humor seems almost distasteful. The lines you posted are hurtful and so racial.  Same with Louie CK.  To me, he was the messiah of comedy.  In just a very small span of time,I have changed."
