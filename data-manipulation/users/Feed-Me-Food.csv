YouShouldKnow,fdsu310,t1_fdql6yf,1578707955.0,I’ve edited my original comment to clarify some of the points raised. I’m absolutely failing at using Reddit right now since it’s 2am so I hope I reply to the right fecking comment this time.
MurderedByWords,fdsjbrx,t1_fdrmqpm,1578703851.0,Wish I could upvote this comment twice you’ve summed it up so well.
YouShouldKnow,fdqk7iw,t1_fdqgldb,1578668668.0,"It can also be incredibly painful and lead to people having life changing health problems. 

One of my patients is currently on the organ donor waiting list for a new liver."
YouShouldKnow,fdqk2dv,t1_fdqh5y6,1578668570.0,"The impact of suicide lasts a lifetime.

EDIT:


Apologies if my comment was insensitive, I’ve been ill and I think I posted that when I was still pretty sicky and wished to contribute but in hindsight didn’t have the time to do so properly. 

I should say that I am a mental health professional and have several friends/family members with mental health issues that I support with to varying degrees. So whilst I made a blanket statement and have never personally been suicidal I am not ignorant of the issues at hand. I work with well over half of my patients on ways to manage suicidal thoughts and what to do if it gets too much.

In response to the people who have no one around them considering suicide; I do appreciate where you’ve come from with that but I also disagree. It is saddening that asking someone to think of the consequences can result in them feeling unimportant. Please know that complete strangers can be affected by a suicide e.g. the paramedics. I still remember every little thing about a man I met just once in a previous job who ended his life shortly after I left him. Without going into details it was tragic and upsetting, mostly because I acknowledge the extreme suffering he experienced in his lifetime. I don’t want to sound like I’m making people feel selfish talking about suicide as I’d like to think I have more tact than that and I know I’m good at my job. 

I’ve rambled and have lacked eloquence in trying to clarify my point here, I should have reread the responses again midway through but I’m tired. Hope I’ve not come across as a total insensitive idiot.."
AskReddit,fdqd71a,t3_emp7g8,1578663531.0,I tend to go with ‘I’m from a tall family’ or say I’m short compared to the rest of them. Tends to move along conversation nicely.
NoStupidQuestions,fdqcx6o,t3_emn386,1578663307.0,"Patients will sometimes contact the original doctor and let them know. Either as a ‘just so you know’ or a ‘fuck you, you misdiagnosed me’."
AskReddit,fdqcsdc,t3_emnaqc,1578663196.0,"I like to eat a lot of food.

My colleagues had recently realised I don’t tend to go more than 90 minutes without snacking and commented on this several times a day as they struggle to believe I am genuinely still hungry and not fat yet."
NoStupidQuestions,fdqbrzb,t1_fdpysky,1578662334.0,"That was generous of you. It makes me happy to be reminded that human being care about each other/environment/animals etc and want to help. Thank you. 

I also totally agree about checking the validity of the organisation you’re donating to. When there was the big earthquake in the Philippines a few years ago I gathered together several bags worth of the essential supplies they were requesting and gave them to a Philippino friend who was sending stuff out there (can’t remember how she was doing it, with the Red Cross maybe?). Anyway some of our more cynical friends suggested given how selfish she was she might have just kept some of the nicer clothes, toiletries and sold the rest. I’ve since stopped helping out another person I know with supplies as I honestly believe she is too inexperienced in the (amazingly well intended and challenging) work she was doing in refugee camps. 
Moral of this now very long reply is that it’s worth checking things out."

NoStupidQuestions,fdpzoyf,t3_emo5d6,1578647651.0,"My ex had to self-catheterise due to a spinal injury. When he’d been unable to complete this for a few days his bladder ruptured and flooded his insides with old urine. He didn’t know it had ruptured until he ended up in ICU about a week later with a really bad infection. 

Different to ‘holding’ your pee given this wasn’t a voluntary action on his part but perhaps still interesting."
NoStupidQuestions,fdpyzw2,t3_emj2od,1578646696.0,"I used to cat sit for a couple that eventually inherited an indoor only cat. The new cat had been a good donor in a former life before being adopted by an elderly relative. The combination of lonely old lady and recently ‘freed’ cat resulted in him being fed so much it genuinely looked like a beach ball with stubby little legs. 
The older cat was allowed outside, the new one wasn’t. No problem since fattie couldn’t even get a shoulder through the cat flap."
tifu,fdp44lj,t3_emgx3k,1578619550.0,This reminds me of my own TIFU a few years ago. I was 18 and went back to where I used to live and was invited camping with a bunch of my parents friends and their kids. I was sat with the younger teenagers trying to fit in so decided to one-up their feeble campfire stories. The next morning I got a telling off from several of the parents as I hadn’t factored in that teenagers are jerks and gave their younger siblings nightmares by repeating the story back before bedtime. Whoops.

As for who leads that’ll happen naturally, you don’t want to be trying to lead because you thinks he’s incapable of it if it’s something he likes to do and doesn’t need help."
sex,fdjv4ag,t3_elj38y,1578488506.0,"My ex of 7 years was paralysed from the chest down, I remember panicking at first how to give him pleasure when he could only feel upwards from his armpits (T2/3 complete). Cowgirl/reverse cowgirl were best but we could do missionary too. Sex in the chair with me holding onto a doorframe and lifting myself up a little whilst he rocked his wheels back and forth was a good one too. 

We just had to focus almost entirely on him getting his pleasure from mine, I found it hard but could get him going a bit by sort of licking/sucking on his neck. 

Hope this helps, best of luck.

Edited to say we had to use a kind of viagra injection"
