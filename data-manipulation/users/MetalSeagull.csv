It might help if you can convince her to keep track of her time spent (valued at minimum wage), the cost of any products, mileage to meetings, and promotional materials they make her buy, to the amount she actually gets in her own bank account.  See how much she's really making per hour.  This is not dismissing it or being non supportive, no matter what she says.  Its taking it very seriously, and treating it like an actual business.  

I would put a mental deadline on tolerating this.  If she's still at it after a year at most, and really six months is all I'd give it knowing what I do now, just get out.  And if she weren't as young as she is, I wouldn't tolerate it at all.  It shows poor judgement, and frankly, gullibility as well.

If I want the plural of a word using autocomplete, it insists there will be a space between the word and the s.  The only way to override that is to place a period and then delete to the end of the word.  I suspect the automatic period after two spaces also doesn't work correctly after an auto completed word, although I'm not sure what causes it."
SelfAwarewolves,fdydilc,t1_fdu6q21,1578778615.0,"Some people are just like that.  They don't really put in an effort to learn things even when it would greatly benefit them.  And they don't value anyone else's time at all.  

Years ago I watched a coworker call the customer support line for an augmented communication device to help her with what seemed like a very basic set up change, such as changing from a 16 grid to a 32 grid.  I asked if it was the first time she'd had to do it, and she said ""no, I always call them.  It's just easier that way.""  No, easier would be learning it so you don't waste long periods of time on call with tech support.  

 I could never get my ex to understand that repeatedly asking for help on the same things was irritating.  Show you once or twice?  Sure!  I'm happy to.  Do it for you every time it comes up?  Now *I've* got a problem.  It draws from the well, so to speak."

AskOldPeople,fdx9l3v,t3_en89ip,1578766659.0,"I've never felt any different mentally, really.  Never had any crisis at 30 or 40 or 50.  My body though, there I can tell a difference.  I had to squat to put air in my car tire recently and felt ""stuck"" when I was ready to get up.  I had to give a little push with my fingertips to stand back up.  And my left shoulder and arm have been cramping daily for about 3 or 4 months now.

You know what?  I guess I do notice a mental difference.  It takes me longer to learn and remember things now.  Used to be if I heard it once, I knew it.  Not so much now."

He said he wouldn't do it if it were his problem, because they're only built to last 8 or 9 years now.  

It was a very nice fridge, though.  Much nicer than the one I replaced it with."
