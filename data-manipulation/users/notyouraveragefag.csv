ABoringDystopia,feqxrfu,t1_fent32m,1579347309.0,"Nope. A land value tax taxes the value of the unimproved land. This means it spurs you to actually build on and use that land.

A property tax taxes the value of the built property. This can lead to undeveloped land because people don’t want to pay higher taxes and just want to wait for the land value to increase.

>	A land value tax or location value tax (LVT), also called a site valuation tax, split rate tax, or site-value rating, is an ad valorem levy on the unimproved value of land. Unlike property taxes, it disregards the value of buildings, personal property and other improvements to real estate. A land value tax is generally favored by economists as (unlike other taxes) it does not cause economic inefficiency, and it tends to reduce inequality.

>	Land value tax has been referred to as ""the perfect tax"" and the economic efficiency of a land value tax has been known since the eighteenth century. Many economists since Adam Smith and David Ricardo have advocated this tax, but it is most famously associated with Henry George, who argued that because the supply of land is fixed and its location value is created by communities and public works, the economic rent of land is the most logical source of public revenue.

clevercomebacks,fej5d9z,t1_feipeve,1579157548.0,"A theory for why Finnish children perform so well in the international scholarly comparison Pisa tests is because the Finnish written language is perfectly phonetic, which means learning how to write takes less time, and children kan pronounce any word they can read. The effect is assumed to be the major reason for the performance difference between Finnish and Swedish speaking students in the country.
The difference is most pronounced (heh) at the early years.

So yes, I would definitely say a phonetically correct language is in atleast one way superior to one which relies on knowing by heart all the different spellings/pronunciations. There’s a reason spelling bees aren’t a thing in Finland."
MurderedByWords,fehv7d6,t1_fehsq4w,1579124522.0,"But I think we’re talking past eachother. Intra-company investment/reinvestment is different than taking money you’ve earned and doing the initial investment. In the second case you’re going to meet the same tax whenever you as a person take money out, so it does weigh on your decision.
In the first case a company decides it makes more sense to spend the money (and I’m not supporting buybacks, those are unfair against the market) to expand, than to pay out.

My example of job creation was not about where the capital comes from, and I agree a healthy middle class does fuel the economy. 
But it is the stock-owner that decides what is done with said capital once the customer has paid for it. And taxation should spur reinvesting over people just cashing out. Which is why I prefer higher personal capital gains taxes (and consumption taxes) over higher corporate taxes. Companies have an easier time moving their tax liabilities abroad than a person does. (Also not opposed to a modest, say 1% wealth tax)

Also please check my edits on the previous post :)
Take care, and thanks for the discussion!"
MurderedByWords,fehq02b,t1_fegs6te,1579121568.0,"Exactly, and Amazon pays other taxes. And when they can’t invest enough they’ll pay federal income tax on their profits.
Hope your understand that now :)

Labor does create product. But it needs tools, resources and all other things. No one sane is saying ”the rich create the jobs”, it’s a strawman is most cases.
But investment does preceed jobs. Doesn’t matter if it’s a lumberjack buying an axe or a baker buying an oven and flour, or Amazon building a data center.

EDIT

>	Now, again, entrepreneurs are an important part of the company-creation process. And so are investors, who risk capital in the hope of earning returns. But, ultimately, whether a new company continues growing and creates self-sustaining jobs is a function of the company's customers' ability and willingness to pay for the company's products, not the entrepreneur or the investor capital.

This is exactly what I’m saying.
Jobs are created when investors and owners put money to start up a company. 
The writer of this piece however totally misses the point that the stockowners own the company and thus control the money once it’s left the customer’s hand. If they choose to use that money to create more jobs, it’s their decision, NOT the customer’s. The stockholders could also choose to milk every cent of profit and skimp on any and all reinvestment, thus in the long run most probably destroying the jobs.

Even when customers keep buying every single product the company sells. Customers maintain income which can pay for currently salaries, but any job creation is solely on the shoulders of those that decide over the money.

EDIT2:

>	Or, to put it even more simply, it's like saying that a seed creates a tree. The seed does not create the tree. The seed starts the tree. But what actually grows and sustains the tree is the combination of the DNA in the seed and the soil, sunshine, water, atmosphere, nutrients, and other factors that nurture it.

To put it more simply: Companies are not preprogrammed things that grow based on a set genetic code just based on how much water and nutrients you give them.
Better comparison: You have a seed, which you plant. It grows a beautiful flower, and people bring you water, nutrients, etc... they give it to you, since it’s your flower. You decide if you want to use it all on that one flower, or if you want to plant another seed. Or maybe drink some of the water.
Point is, the flower brings the people, the people bring the things to help it thrive and grow, but you decide how much to water the plant."
MurderedByWords,fegqz40,t1_fegmebo,1579100474.0,"All of those countries view investments as pre-tax expenses and many allow tax deductions for investments. The US is not in any way special in this regard.
Investment is not an on/off switch, it’s the amount of investment which can have an effect on if a company has to pay tax.

Any and all of these combinations are possible:
Invest and pay tax
Invest and no tax
No investment, pay tax
No investment, no tax

Thank you for quoting Lincoln. I hope you see how even he knew jobs come before consumption, or deferred consumption which enables capital investment!"
