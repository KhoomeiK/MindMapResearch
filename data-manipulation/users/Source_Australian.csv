Long story short USBIF is just only one group among a bunch of others. Basically any time there is a “need” for a standard. A companies get together and create a group that builds, designs and pushes a spec. It’s also open to other companies, competitors and the public.

Subs like that are democratic and you have mods acting as leaders for the users, by sticking important threads for events. But for the most part the community polices the stuff it wants to see itself. And the mods guide with a gentle and caring hand. 

Here it’s more of dictatorships where a handful of people determine what’s best for everyone. If you don’t like it. There is the door. What a cold, hostile and boring place. 

Personally I’ve been subbed since around 10k users and commented quite a lot back then. However I’ve stopped because it has become stifling and oppressive. 
Make a slight, light hearted joke? Delete. Why? Why can’t someone make a joke? Delete? Have a casual questions? Delete. Because it’s lounge quality. 
Any thing that would build a community togetherness like hearty discussion, comradeship, insider jokes. It all gets punted or deleted. Want to submit a post? Here’s some hurdles. People can’t be trusted to use the arrows. 
If a user were to upload some fan art. And the community were to upvote it to the top. Would that be such a horrible thing?

I prefer to watch videos by people who are just kind of documenting their life on a trail. Which is why I like the people with barely any views. Because it’s not their job, or trying to make a career out of it. Such as Mitch Lenington. The dude just documented his triple crown. The audio is shit. He tells you when the days suck.

formula1,fdojgfr,t1_fdn1e74,1578606380.0,"Sport photography is an interesting thing. In a lot of cases a photographer will have several stationary cameras setup but only rigged to shoot when the photographer clicks the camera they are holding.  

Soccer is a good example. So they would get a camera, usually with a wide lens, and set it up behind the goal. And rig the camera with a device called a pocket wizard. When this device gets a command. It will fire the shutter. 
Then from the side line they will be carrying their main camera and it’s also equipped with a pocket wizard. When someone goes to shoot a goal. The photographer from the side line will press the shutter for a photo. The pocket wizard will communicate to the other pocket wizard connected to the other camera. And it will also shoot a shot. 

So 1 photographer, 2 cameras. 2 angles. Taking 2 shots at once. 

Rocket launches are done in a different manner. They use a sound trigger. Basically says. When you hear a loud noise over X dB. Fire the shutter. 
So a photographer will setup cameras all around a rocket so when it launches. The cameras are firing. 
They do not allow a photographer to get close to a rocket launch. But they are ok with a stationary camera. As long as they know if something goes wrong their camera is toast. And it’s all on them. 
I’m guessing putting a camera just behind a barrier is ok. Just so that they know it’s a risk to the gear. 

I guess for F1. A photographer might use a mix of this. Say setup 1 or two cameras on sound trigger. So you can get it as it’s going past. (Assuming the delay isn’t bad) or setup several cameras with pocket wizard. In an area. And they can shoot from the grand stands. 

Also another thing to note is that the range is pretty far. So it’s not uncommon for a photographer to set one of these up high up on a roof with a big long lens on a grandstand. So you have lots of options. And you can chain heaps of them. So if you wanted to setup 10 cameras all linked to your camera. It would work just fine."

Futurology,fdfpkuh,t1_fdeybz4,1578367153.0,"Essentially from I gather it’s an old style of doing things in large gardens. Basically you grow some hedges or walls to screen off parts of the garden to create areas of interest / highlight growth. 

The one I visited had several. A formal garden like a French kind. (Hedges and topiary) then you would go around a corner and see a wild British garden. And as you went on you found parts where it was fruit trees, step through and then you would find a woodland etc. 

So as you walk through it you go through different areas with a focus on a different style/ variety or purpose. Such as an area for stone fruit.

I’ve been wanting to hike for a few years but I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. So the focus is for me is paying off the mortgage, ensuring my retirement is looking good, great financial advisors managing my long term investments the whole 9 yards. Because if I were to just quit and hike and be a dirt bag like I want to. There is almost no quality of life for me when I’m older otherwise. Or even when I get back. It’s just so very very expensive. 

So I’ve had to wait and save, and spend my money wisely, minimal luxuries etc. I estimate I can do it in 2 years. 
Why not now? Well I work in IT too, in a specialised area. I get around 6 weeks off a year and once you work for a company for a while you get long service leave. Which means in a nutshell, extra leave. 

So I’ll take around 4 months paid leave from the long service leave. And then another 6 weeks from the annual leave. Which means after costs, the hike, flights etc. I should end up getting paid for the whole hike, and saving money doing it. And that’s for two people.

The fact is every 10 years or so there is a huge failure a nuclear plant. We have got fairly lucky with Chernobyl and Fukushima. Both could have been much much worse. Nuclear itself is fine in theory. It’s just the meat bags operating them is the problem. 
Humans are gonna continue to make mistakes so it’s just a matter of time until we screw it up again. Risk vs reward in my book is just too high. 

The catastrophic failure mode of solar panels is that it burns my house down. The catastrophic failure mode of nuclear it kills millions. 
The cost of solar / wind / battery are better. 
The ease of deployment is better. 
The payback vs investment time is better.
Barely any government oversight / approval process. 
It also doesn’t create waste products that have to be stores for thousands of years. Safely. 

It might have made sense years ago but the cost per kilowatt for nuclear vs solar. Makes more sense. 
Blame environmental activists all you want but solar is proven to be cheaper and safer. Where as nuclear is expensive and harmful. Based on empirical data."
