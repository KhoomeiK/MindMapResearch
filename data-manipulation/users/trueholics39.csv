relationship_advice,fe4ciyz,t3_ennkc6,1578857860.0,"So this may kind of hurt to hear, but is there any way you can try talking to your husband to see if you guys can work something out?

Now granted, I do not justify your husbands actions in any way, shape or form. The way he has been treating you for years is absolutely abysmal and he needs to change his behavior if something is going to work.

But the question is, before you go on that job your husband requests you don’t do, would you still be willing to make something work? I only ask because you guys have been together for 15 years. That’s a pretty big portion of your life, and too often on this sub the common advice people give is to leave the relationship/do what you want and I’ve seen too many ppl give up what they’ve devoted a huge portion of their life to over something they may have not given enough thought. And yknow, relationships have problems and take a lot of effort to make work."

This issue hits pretty close to home because I had a pretty insane band director in high school. He would do shit like throw chairs, threaten people, scream and throw tantrums over trivial things, make students feel worthless, all in the pursuit of some human “greatness” he was supposedly trying to get us to achieve. It got so bad eventually the administration had no choice but to reluctantly fire him despite his award winning reputation and the money he was bringing into the school.

The final straw for him was when he tried to blackmail a student. Basically a senior needed to miss ONE SINGLE REHEARSAL due to having a volleyball meet that day. He thought if he told the director two weeks in advanced, there’d be no problem. But no, the director not only flipped out on him, but he told the student that if he dared skip the rehearsal then he would call all the universities that student applied to and tell them how horrible of a student he was. Needless to say, this finally got him fired.

What still fucks with my mind today is the amount of students that would go without permission to administration meetings to try and defend this scum of a man. They were so hypnotized with this ideal of greatness that they were willing to get suspended just so they can suffer more years of abuse with this psychotic douchebag!!!!!"

Many ppl give band directors a pass cuz their respected professionals or whatever. But the shit that happens in movies like whiplash is not too far off from reality.

Now admittedly I’m one of those woodwinds who get off easy, and I won’t deny that, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’ve seen first hand how abusive/manipulative/insane band directors can be. I understand you have a passion for music, but as someone who’s been through it I can say it simply isn’t worth putting up with. Hell, it can ruin your entire life if you let it get to you.
