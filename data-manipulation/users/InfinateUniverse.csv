>Typo is when you accidentally mkae a splling mistake. Engrish is when you don't can speak English, but uses it anyway.

Saying ""herro"" isn't Engrish, it's a typo, an accidental spelling mistake. But you're right about ""strong work done"" being Engrish, since it's a translation.

Same goes with ""ploice"". It isn't Engrish, it's a typo, like you said. So yes, it doesn't belong on r/engrish. That's what I'm getting at.
