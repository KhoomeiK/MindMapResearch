StarWars,ffeiuso,t1_ffefz2o,1579849794.0,I'm not sure that was really him seeing into the future as much as it was him just being smart enough to figure out why Obi-Wan was there.
swtor,ffd0d3a,t1_ffcwxj0,1579810935.0,Light side sith is less about being a goody two shoes and more about being manipulative and smart. Also what the fuck was that last comment? Lol.
AskReddit,ff688ty,t3_ero8mj,1579621459.0,"He'd probably be disapointed, but he would also be too anxious and shy to say anything about it."

StarWars,fexwn4f,t1_fex4mmb,1579437684.0,I can't think of a single argument that could be made that would prove he's good.

swtor,fersqj4,t3_eqet8k,1579357959.0,"I feel like the option you choose when speaking to him about agreeing with his points but disagreeing with the way he's doing it sums it up perfectly. Malgus IMO was absolutely right, the empire must change and let go of their hatred towards aliens if it ever wants to succeed in defeating the republic, but a full blown rebellion would've done more harm than good. The empire was already at war with the republic, a civil war would have meant the end for both the empire and Malgus's rebellion."

swtor,fegm64h,t1_fegiz6t,1579096989.0,I think I may have been as well. On Tatooine right? If I remember correctly there was also some dude spouting bullshit about how gays weren't people and were abominations.
swtor,fegm1mg,t1_feg8bkr,1579096890.0,I'd say it's a little of both...or a lot of both.

pics,fegkka3,t1_fegix7w,1579095604.0,"I mean...I get everyone's different but personally someone telling me ""God has a plan"" or ""God works in mysterious ways"" just makes it worse. You mean to tell me some deity somewhere unbeknownst to me decided to suddenly take my loved one away with no warning or explanation all because of some plan they choose to keep secret from everyone? Yeah, not a very comforting thought.

I don't really get why people ever say shit like it's all according to some great plan. Like just say I'm sorry for your loss or something along those lines and leave it at that."

I can't remember where I read or heard that but I thought most people didn't even know he existed. If so it would be wierd that they would be talking about him on the radio.

movies,fchabcr,t1_fcgpa0e,1577648713.0,"I've honestly found it therapeutic to see movies alone. No worrying about seating with friends, no planning ahead of time with people so everyone can go and everyone can get what they want before heading in, no waiting on anyone if they're late...you just go in, get what snacks you want if any, sit down, relax, and enjoy the film. Now that's not to say I don't still enjoy going to movies with friends because I do, but there's something just relaxing and chill about seeing movies by myself.

As for what people think, no one cares. And if they do, why should you care? You don't need their validation to find enjoyment in something."
