DaenerysWinsTheThrone,ffa3wks,t3_esgclu,1579727380.0,"Not really true.

That's not really how feudalism worked (I will work on the assumption that Westeros feudalism worked more or less like real life feudalism worked because in most cases it's true and because ASOIAF drew a lot of inspiration from english feudalism and the war of the roses). 

When you became a vassal of another lord, it did not mean your title got to them. It just meant that you would have to assist your liege should they call their vassals to arms. Your titles still belonged to you and in a lot of cases they did not call all their vassals to arms all the time so most of the time being a vassal to someone else had little impact and was just a promise that you would come to help if your liege called you for help.  

There was obviously a hierarchy between you but it was far from as clear cut as you could think, especially if you were a powerful vassal because even though your liege is generally more powerful than you (if he wasn't you would probably have broke alliance with them already) if you are fairly powerful you leaving would mean a big loss of influence for them which would be a hube blow so it's in their best interest to keep you somewhat happy or at least not openly be a dick to you. It also meant that they could not call their vassals all the time because then the vassals would start getting angry because mobilizing and travelling to where your vassal needed you was effort and it came with a cost both in time and in money.

It's important because if for example you were duke of land A, count of land B and knight of C you still kept these titles if you broke alliance with your liege and joined another.

Your liege could also absolutly not call themselves using your titles, this would have been usurpation and would have been a grave offense, potentially leading to either war with your liege if you were powerful enough to challenge them or to you breaking alliance without dishonor since your liege was obviously a dick to you by trying to usurp your titles.

Feudalism may seem like a fairly simple hierarchical system but it's anything but and it involved a ton of politics since alliances and balance of power could be very shifting."
