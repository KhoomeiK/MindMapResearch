depression,fefbukl,t3_eophbs,1579052902.0,"Your story resonates with me. I had a hard childhood just like you. Lost my only parent and was in foster care. Was abused by the people that cared for me. Left at 18 for college and that was a struggle. I suffered from depression, felt out of place because I went to a school with a lot of people that had rich parents. I had no support I even was homeless one semester and had to medically withdraw from school for a semester because I couldn’t even function. I somehow managed to graduate even though it took me 5 years but I did it. Fast forward to now. I’m 34, and a social worker living a decent life with everything  I could ask for two vehicles, a nice home. I actually work with people with mental illness now. I still have no support as I don’t talk to my family that’s left. I’m still in therapy and I take meds for depression. I had to even go on short term disability once for my depression.. but I kept going. I know it doesn’t seem like things will get better, but it does! I promise! You have so much to live for!"

depression,fd2ztrm,t3_ejnao7,1578153380.0,"I’m so glad I have this platform to vent to. I do think people around me is over hearing me be sad. They should think about how I feel. It’s worse for the person experiencing it. Everyone needs an outlet though, whether it’s on here, therapy or a good friend."
heartbreak,fcl2jo2,t1_fckx1j7,1577738413.0,I still miss mine too and since then I have had difficulty dating. Just know for whatever reason it didn’t work out and someone eventually will come along. Try distracting yourself or do something to improve yourself.
heartbreak,fckbrpq,t3_ehjwdw,1577721755.0,Something similar happened to me before. Someone ended a relationship abruptly after everything was fine. He told me he just didn’t love me although he said it first. He lied about his feelings the whole time because he thought he should love me. It hurts so bad and you go back and forth in your mind about what could’ve been done to make it right. Nothing helped me but time. It took me months to get over it. He was my bestfriend. Don’t be mad at yourself for thinking about it or being sad and one day you’ll wake up and you’ll be totally fine.
depression,fc6itzn,t3_cml6ni,1577481607.0,"I left a beach trip with some of my closest friends today. I’m not ok. I took a shower and was balling. Told my friend something came up I had to go. Life is good. I’m finishing my masters, I have a beautiful home, starting a new job in the new year. I’m mad at myself for feeling this way but I can’t snap out of it. I rushed home just to be lonely in the dark. Depression really sucks and it hits you at the worst times."
