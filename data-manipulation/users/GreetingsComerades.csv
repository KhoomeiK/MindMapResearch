ClashOfClans,fdl4y3y,t1_fdl2xzs,1578517115.0,"Take poison in CC, with some high DPS ground unit inside it. I'd go with max pekkas and giants if your Clan can provide it, in a Stone Slammer. Deploy Stone Slammer at about 12:00, from there it should path right next to CC, pulling it. Then while your CC troops and enemy CC troops are fighting, deploy queen from 9:00, with all healers on the queen, with King on one side to funnel and wizard on the other side, wallbreak her into TH compartment. Support queen and healers with your 2x rage spells when needed, use poison spell to help u deal with enemy Queen and enemy  CC once you're done with QW, deploy hogs in a large cluster, try to get them to path in a U shape around the base, heal them with 3 heal spells when needed. Lastly, deploy wizards around the base sporadically to help take out trash buildings for cleanup.

For army composition, you need 5 healers to keep your queen alive, 4-5 wizards, 5-6 wallbreakers, and fill the rest of ur capacity with hog riders. For spells you'll need 2 rage and 3 heal, one poison, and a second poison from CC.

I hope this helps! Fair warning: this is a three star strat, so if you don't do everything right you'll probably end up with a time fail or a 1-star fail. I'd reccomend practicing QW Hog attack against clanmates using friendly challenges. For future reference, ""ItZu (ENG)"" on YouTube makes great in-depth tutorials and guides for all kinds of attacks, including QW Hogs. Good luck, tell me how it went!! 😁"

ClashOfClans,fdl2n3e,t3_elyfxo,1578516015.0,"Queen charge hogrider. If u can get the queen to enter the base at about 9:00 u should be able to get TH, an inferno tower, and the enemy Queen quite easily, then somehow lure CC, then go in with hogs. Bring 4-5 wizards for funnelling the queen/cleanup. Good luck, hope this helps!"
