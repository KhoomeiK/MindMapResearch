One more thing I just remembered, there is a sign post somewhere on the island that costs 8 coins. Buy this and when you best the level you will unlock an asset for use in the future.

Kingdomnewlands,fdqimnb,t3_emkykq,1578667590.0,"Hey there! I haven't played in a good while but here are some things I learned and I ended up getting through the entire game:

- At the start, run to the left until you hit a portal and then to the right until you hit a portal, taking note of any statues and such you see along the way. The main thing to look out for though is the closest village to your castle. These guys are your best friends as they provide peasants that you can recruit for 1 coin each- it's important not to chop down the tree closest to either side of the village or expand your castle wall beyond the village itself or it will disappear.

- back in your town, make some archers and builders, focusing on archers for now. The archers will hang out beyond your farthest wall during the day and will retreat behind the wall at night. Half of your archers go left, half go right (and with builders).

- Now to set up some money making! A great thing to do for money that is viable for pretty well the whole game is to use your builders to clear trees beyond your farthest wall in the direction that won't screw up the village. After a few minutes you will see tall grass grow - this grass generates rabbits which the archers will hunt during daytime. If you have a large enough area cleared and enough archers you will get an *insane* amount of money every day.

- I'm sure you've noticed our friends The Greed attacking every night. A great way to deal with them is to ride out across the map (with a few dollars) and find an old mossy statue: using coins on the statue will grant your archers much better accuracy for the next 24 game hours, and you can stack this upgrade three or four times. So every couple of days just ride out and top up the statue and your super archers will have no trouble taking out the greed on island 2.

- Now we're at the part where I'm guessing you're having trouble: how in the hell do I get the boat past the portals? If you hang out just outside your farthest wall you will see an arrow above your head with a cost of one coin. Using a coin here gives a ""charge"" order and it makes all of your units on that side run either until they get to a portal and attempt to destroy it, they reach the edge of the island, or night time comes. A good strategy from my experience is to get your boat built and moving and on the next dawn after all the greed from the night are killed send your charge. Once the archers start attacking the portal greed will start to come out sporadically, and if all the archers are defeated the ones on the boat will take care of any extra enemies before they get to your castle. You will get another unit later in the game that will march in front of your archers and take heat from enemies (and you can heal them with gold), making destroying portals much easier.

- Once a portal falls, let your army go back to base! A large attack group of greed is spawned, regardless of time of day. You will need your walls to choke them and give your archers enough time to take them out

I think that's about it man, again I haven't played in a good while but that should get you going at least. If you have a specific question feel free to reply and I'll see what I can remember. Good luck!"
