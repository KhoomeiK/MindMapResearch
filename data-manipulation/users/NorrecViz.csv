However, when it comes to understanding Luffy and his drive, only Zoro really get's him. The others all have their goals, sure.

The others needed encouragement to pursue their dreams, Zoro and Luffy were doing it from the start, on their own.

reddeadredemption,feed07y,t1_fee4abq,1579031222.0,"> As an antagonist, Micah is well written. As a character with thoughts and motives, Micah is poorly written.

Quite frankly, this is where youre argument fell apart to begin with, in my mind. Micah cannot be well written and poorly written at the same time. If he is a well written antagonist, that means he serves his function within the narrative and propably elicits the emotional response that the writer intended. It means that his motives (how ever simple they might be, greed, survival) can be understood. These boxes can all be checked for Micah.

You wanted to see more of Micah? I'd say that's a sign that the writers did their job well.

By the way, Micah did explain some of his philosophy (if you want to call it that) in some of the missions and camp interactions, so that also checks the ""thoughts"" box. Homocidal racist darwinist would propably describe him pretty well."

reddeadredemption,fedlgz2,t1_fed894w,1579014457.0,"You shouldn't just make a character change because it's ""more interesting"". The motivation for that change needs to come from the character. Obviously, ideally these should go hand in hand. If you want the story to be about Micah changing he should have proper motivation for that. But in the story Rockstar told, there is no motivation for Micah to change, hence he doesn't.

Micah is a secondary villain with the goal to make as much money as possible with the gang while putting a rift in between them at the same time so he does not have to share the spoils with as many people (none, if possible). That's why he mourns no lost comrades, forms no attachments. That motivation does not change within the scope of the game. Was he always like that? Maybe. But the change in his character might have happened long before he ever joined up with the Van der Linde gang. You can become set in your ways, you know.

That doesn't mean that story couldn't have been told, but it just wasn't.

As far as contribution to the story: That's opening pandoras box. Why was Swanson there? Was Mary-Beth really needed? How about Uncle?"
reddeadredemption,fed83zy,t1_fed7lrc,1579003202.0,"Micah doesn't change (as much as that statement can be true about a two faced son of a bitch like Micah), true . But why should he? He does what works for him. He is a survivor, so he survives. That is both his motive and modus operandi. He does not change, which ultimately leads to his demise. That too is a character arc.

However, I am not trying to change your mind here, just contrasting your perspective with my own. Let's agree to disagree."
reddeadredemption,fed78yf,t1_fed6e86,1579002176.0,"But you do see hints of Micah (somehow) charming Dutch. All througout the game. The Blackwater-Job? Micahs idea, that Dutch must have been convinced by somehow. The meet up with the O'Driscolls? Heavily lobbied for by Micah. You see him buttering up Dutch troughout the game as well, but never in your face.

Micah is always a dick to Arthur. So to Arthur (and you, the player), Micah is a dick. Micah does not care how Arthur views him, because Dutch is running the show. Micahs relationship with Dutch is not the same, at all. So, how exactly is Micah one dimensional again?"

reddeadredemption,fed4hl6,t1_fed3wtn,1578998410.0,"A character being well written does not mean that we get to see every facet of them. 

You experience RDR2 from Arthurs perspective not via omniscient narrator. Therefore, you will be left in the dark about most peoples motivations and dealings. Shining a light on everything would be bad writing.

Your point about Dutch really illustrates that point: Your interpretation is, that he actually cared for the members of his gang. My interpretation is, that he cared to be a leader, to be idolized. Didn't really matter by whom. Now, Rockstar could have given us a manifesto written by Dutch, in which we get to see who he is, definitively. But we didn't. And that's a good thing."
reddeadredemption,fed3l9r,t1_fed2zar,1578997097.0,"Well, but with some people, what you see is what you get. Micah being one of those people does not mean he is poorly written.

Also, how exactly is Micah not a human being with failings? Wouldn't you consider comitting atrocities without any real motivation a human failing? I sure do.

Additionally, you shouldn't discount the possibility, that we just never get to see Micahs other side. I mean, he was able to charm the pants off of Dutch, and I don't think he did that by being the asshole he was to everyone else.
