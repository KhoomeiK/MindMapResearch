And I just really hated s’mores and all the other layered drinks way more. Especially when people would bitch that it didn’t look like the photo when we would pour too fast and the whip and chocolate would go up. 

I HATE that kids still ask for it when it was a one week(end) thing 5 years ago way more than ever needing to make it."
starbucks,fe3hcdy,t1_fe3b1jq,1578849276.0,"I figured all stores got them except very tiny kiosks. The only time I worked in a store without one (as a borrowed partner) was because it broke often, that store was  high volume and a small kiosk, so they kept it in their of site storage room. 
They were broken at basically every store except for very low volume stores though. Ours would get stuck with the capsule thing locked 75% of the time and 20% with it just not carbonating or sealing. 

They were a pain to deal with and the foam made it so that when it settled you basically had at least 1 inch less of liquid than normal."

starbucks,fe1vkcq,t3_enmibj,1578831375.0,Sparkling sangria is still my all time favorite drink but our fizzio was always broken so I could only order it at other stores and unicorn frappucino wasn’t that bad to make.
fatlogic,fdr5vkz,t1_fdqdvq2,1578679885.0,I was lucky and went from an uncommon size to a standard size they carry everywhere.
fatlogic,fdotvsp,t1_fdn8o22,1578612762.0,"This is exactly why I lost weight too, this and jeans. Levi’s are 100€ a pair here (70€ clearance if you’re lucky vs the 40/50$ I paid in the US) and I couldn’t wear my stretch jeans for more than 3 hours without being in pain."
fatlogic,fda3euc,t1_fcw6bz4,1578241199.0,"I think it’s usually done with medication or if they intend to push the flu shot or any vaccinations on you. 
I remember when I went yearly (or more often) as  I was growing that I’d be weighed every time but as an adult I only remember being weighed when i needed a through check up for a visa to travel (where I also needed some other medical tests done and medical forms done.) 

Although now I live in germany., They seem to never really weigh people here. I wasn’t weighed at the ER (stomach pains due to undiagnosed gastritis) or when I got a new house doctor and new medication. It could be that weight is stored on my medical ID online and the doctor pulls it up and as long as I don’t seem to far from the weight they take it as my current weight."
fatlogic,fbetww0,t1_fbaldfj,1576793846.0,"Yeah I was confused with that line too. Sure some poke bowls are made with mayo based sauces (ime only the spicy ones) but some are just made with soy sauce and seaweed. Most poke bowl places only really use other veggies as toppings. Maybe OP ment because it’s often more than half rice? 

If OP was from Hawaii, maybe she means because it’s at least half rice, and then only fish, sauce and maybe some seaweed or green onion and no veggies,so “it’s not healthy”? But in Hawaii there are much worse and fatty local favorites. If anything it’s just an expensive treat because it’s often fairly expensive."
