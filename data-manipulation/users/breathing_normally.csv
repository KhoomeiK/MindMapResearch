AnimalsBeingDerps,fffbtfc,t1_ffewib9,1579880507.0,Thanks! 8 year old me probably concluded the brain eating part from the warning that fox pee could make you really ill.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffekxi1,t1_ffeiwom,1579852387.0,Don’t they also have those brain eating parasites in their piss? I was always told not to pick wild blackberries that are close to the ground for that reason.

tech,ffa7xnu,t1_ff9musk,1579729628.0,"Whether its tough on companies shouldn’t matter. Whether it’s tough on the market (economy) matters. And it really isn’t. There are lots of IT security companies that welcome stricter measures. There is no money or productivity lost on a macroeconomic scale, it’s just rerouted."

gaming,feyl1kq,t1_feyhg8v,1579447001.0,"Yeah but maybe parallel ports will make a comeback. And this S-Video cable is like new, would be a waste to toss it out. And that ps/2 to usb adapter ... best keep that too. Also just the one SCART cable just to be safe. You know, for the apocalypse. Eh, I’ll put the box back for now, it hardly takes up any space anyway"

WinStupidPrizes,fexjtw5,t1_fewtewq,1579432146.0,Yeah they should probably retake the elearning course
