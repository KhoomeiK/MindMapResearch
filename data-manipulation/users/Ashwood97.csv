By your own arguement, you can't claim that Glen doesn't refer to Scotland. Even if she wasn't from Scotland, it would be more likely for her to travel north a bit to Scotland than across Europe to modern day Albania."
HPfanfiction,fffgvpe,t1_fffeqpi,1579883688.0,"Scotland was referred to Alba/Abania/Glen during the time Rowena Ravevenclaw and the other founders lived. Likewise the country of Albania wasn't established and would be apart of the Byzantine Empire, thus not referred to as Albania. The video I linked explains it in further detail."
HPfanfiction,ffe9y3q,t3_esyxlt,1579840792.0,"Albania is the litainization of the Gaelic name for Scotland, Alba. High chance it's not actually modern day country of Albania in the Balkans.

SuperCarlinBrothers made a video explaining it as well.

AskReddit,fevuvjv,t3_eqies2,1579401817.0,"I was house/cat sitting for my cousin while she was traveling. One evening, I needed to feed her cats dinner and take care of a few other things. My mom came with me. Afterwards, while on the highway heading home there were maybe a few cars we had seen on the road but there really wasn't any traffic. I was in the far left lane for no particular reason and decided to merge into the middle lane. I was going around 75 mph. I do the standard check blindspot & mirrors and I see no one, there wasn't a single car behind me. Granted it was dark but it was a long, straight stretch of highway on a clear night with plenty of streetlights. If there was someone there, I would have seen them, but since I didn't, I put on my blinker and began to merge. 
Out of fucking nowhere, there's a purple mustang right next to me in middle lane I was merging into. We were both half in the same lane, half in another & sharing the lane at some point. They were flying past us at 100+ mph and sped off in the night. My mom & I were horrified.
The only way I can explain it is if they didn't have there headlights on & were really far behind us when I check my mirrors and such. But if that was the case they would had to have been going like 150 mph or something insane like that."
