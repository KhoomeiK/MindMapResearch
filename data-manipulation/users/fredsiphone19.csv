The kinetic energy has somewhere to go that’s not your body - ie: pushing the bike away from you.  


Or so I understand it.  I could be wrong.  I yam not a docta.


Edit;  I just watched it again.  The bike seat smashes into the muscled area surrounding his spine, and he rides the bike down and gets his hands under him.

He’ll be VERY sore in his lower back, but his body did an incredible job of handling the fall - had he kicked the bike away from him, I doubt he could have gotten his hands under him and bounced off the concrete like he did with the bike - I think he would have essentially landed flat on the concrete, putting his head in real danger."

Pros:
It’s so much fun you won’t want to park and go to work.

You are FAST to work.  First off the line, no traffic, can weave through snags/fit around busses.

Zoom!

Cons:
A race bike is not really built for the rigors of traffic.  Because you’ll go from fully leaned to upright to flat footed, your back/shoulders will take a beating.

My clutch lever is HEAVY and my bike hates finding neutral.  Stoplights are the one time you get to shake out the lactic acid, and those two factors mean sometimes I don’t get any time to recover between spurts.

My bike HATES going slow.  I’ve killed it trying to ease off the line because it wants to jump, not accelerate gently.  Often I’ll not be paying attention, moving at what’s a cruising speed, look down and I’m going 63 MPH in a city with a 35 speed limit.

Combined above with the sparse police presence in my city, and dense traffic, it’s imperative to not learn bad habits.  Let the Corolla win.  It’s not worth it.

The geometry of motorcycles is adaptive and fluid - when you smash the front brakes on a motorcycle, if the brakes themselves are not “warmed up” ie - applied gradually, the motorcycle will dip forward explosively.   the reverse is true, but because of the center of gravity being different, and the output of the bike counteracting downward push, if you locked the rear, you just slide.  The bike still dips down towards your butt, but you don’t immediately die as a result.  I’ve slipped my rear plenty of times braking suddenly, it’s not even that worrisome if you’ve ever driven in snow/ water - you slide a bit but have some control.

But here we didn’t brake evenly, or have the brakes warmed - That’s what caused the stoppie.  

The front of the bike dove forward, but the back was still moving SUPER fast, so it lost traction with the ground, and began to front flip, but because motorcycle tires are great at gripping asphalt, and the front brake locked up, and no longer impeded the spin of the wheel, the front wheel maintained traction under this new center of gravity and instead of front flipping like a pedal bike would, he’s now doing a reverse-wheelie, directly into the front of a car.

Again, take this with a grain of salt, but hitting the bike seat with his caboose will hurt like crazy, and well could mess his spine up, thereâ€™s a bounce from impacting the bike, and then the bike having somewhere to go that very much lessons the impact trauma.  

The kinetic energy has somewhere to go thatâ€™s not your body - ie: pushing the bike away from you.  


Or so I understand it.  I could be wrong.  I yam not a docta.


Edit;  I just watched it again.  The bike seat smashes into the muscled area surrounding his spine, and he rides the bike down and gets his hands under him.

Heâ€™ll be VERY sore in his lower back, but his body did an incredible job of handling the fall - had he kicked the bike away from him, I doubt he could have gotten his hands under him and bounced off the concrete like he did with the bike - I think he would have essentially landed flat on the concrete, putting his head in real danger."

Pros:
Itâ€™s so much fun you wonâ€™t want to park and go to work.

You are FAST to work.  First off the line, no traffic, can weave through snags/fit around busses.

Zoom!

Cons:
A race bike is not really built for the rigors of traffic.  Because youâ€™ll go from fully leaned to upright to flat footed, your back/shoulders will take a beating.

My clutch lever is HEAVY and my bike hates finding neutral.  Stoplights are the one time you get to shake out the lactic acid, and those two factors mean sometimes I donâ€™t get any time to recover between spurts.

My bike HATES going slow.  Iâ€™ve killed it trying to ease off the line because it wants to jump, not accelerate gently.  Often Iâ€™ll not be paying attention, moving at whatâ€™s a cruising speed, look down and Iâ€™m going 63 MPH in a city with a 35 speed limit.

Combined above with the sparse police presence in my city, and dense traffic, itâ€™s imperative to not learn bad habits.  Let the Corolla win.  Itâ€™s not worth it.

The geometry of motorcycles is adaptive and fluid - when you smash the front brakes on a motorcycle, if the brakes themselves are not â€œwarmed upâ€ ie - applied gradually, the motorcycle will dip forward explosively.   the reverse is true, but because of the center of gravity being different, and the output of the bike counteracting downward push, if you locked the rear, you just slide.  The bike still dips down towards your butt, but you donâ€™t immediately die as a result.  Iâ€™ve slipped my rear plenty of times braking suddenly, itâ€™s not even that worrisome if youâ€™ve ever driven in snow/ water - you slide a bit but have some control.

But here we didnâ€™t brake evenly, or have the brakes warmed - Thatâ€™s what caused the stoppie.  

The front of the bike dove forward, but the back was still moving SUPER fast, so it lost traction with the ground, and began to front flip, but because motorcycle tires are great at gripping asphalt, and the front brake locked up, and no longer impeded the spin of the wheel, the front wheel maintained traction under this new center of gravity and instead of front flipping like a pedal bike would, heâ€™s now doing a reverse-wheelie, directly into the front of a car.
