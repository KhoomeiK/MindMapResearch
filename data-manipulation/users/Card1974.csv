Don't use chiropractors, choose licensed sports massagers instead."

NoStupidQuestions,fc9tz5l,t3_egt3vo,1577558188.0,"One way to remember your dreams is writing them down immediately as you wake up.

Restricting sensory input helps you remember details longer, so another trick is keeping a notebook on your night table with several pens and scribbling your dream on it, eyes closed. Change the pages often for obvious reasons and write a clean version after you've managed to get the essential parts on paper.

I used the above method in the 80s with moderate success; it made remembering even the mundane dreams much easier. These days a recording app might work better; I haven't bothered with dream journals for years."
YouShouldKnow,fc9n48z,t3_egriem,1577555175.0,"A good thumb rule for a new exercise / habit / lifestyle change etc. is that you should manage to do it for three weeks straight for the new thing to become a daily habit. Most people begin to skip / cheat on week two.

Avoid the popular ""30 day challenges"" typically found on Facebook / imgur etc. You will either burn out or injure yourself with those; typically they do not allow for enough time for rest and recovery.

Practically every fitness magazine will be featuring a much more sensible program tailored for beginners on their Dec / Jan issues. Choose any of those."
