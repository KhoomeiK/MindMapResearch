When people insist, however, she tells them about Sean Doyle.

Around Christmas 2002, bartender Doyle went out drinking with pal Michael Wright and Wright’s girlfriend. As they all walked home, Wright thought Doyle was hitting on his girlfriend, and witnesses later told cops they saw a man getting “the s–t beat out of him.” He was heard screaming, “No, don’t break my legs!” and another witness said he saw someone throw Doyle down an open manhole.

The drop was 18 feet (5,5 m). At the bottom was a pool of boiling ­water, from a broken main. Doyle didn’t die instantly — in fact, as first responders arrived, he was standing below, reaching up and screaming for help. No paramedic or firefighter could climb down to help — it was, a Con Ed supervisor said, 300 degrees (150 °C) in the steam tunnel.

Four hours later, Sean Doyle’s body was finally recovered. Its temperature was 125 degrees (over 51 °C) — the medical examiners thought it was likely way higher, but thermometers don’t read any higher than that.

When Melinek saw the body on her autopsy table, she writes, she thought he’d “been steamed like a lobster.” His entire outer layer of skin had peeled off, and his internal organs were literally cooked.

He otherwise had no broken bones and no head trauma, which meant he was fully conscious as he boiled to death.

“The worst nightmares I ever had in my two years at OCME,” Melinek writes, “came after I performed the postmortem examination of Sean Doyle.”

NoStupidQuestions,fc9tz5l,t3_egt3vo,1577558188.0,"One way to remember your dreams is writing them down immediately as you wake up.

Restricting sensory input helps you remember details longer, so another trick is keeping a notebook on your night table with several pens and scribbling your dream on it, eyes closed. Change the pages often for obvious reasons and write a clean version after you've managed to get the essential parts on paper.

I used the above method in the 80s with moderate success; it made remembering even the mundane dreams much easier. These days a recording app might work better; I haven't bothered with dream journals for years."
YouShouldKnow,fc9n48z,t3_egriem,1577555175.0,"A good thumb rule for a new exercise / habit / lifestyle change etc. is that you should manage to do it for three weeks straight for the new thing to become a daily habit. Most people begin to skip / cheat on week two.

Avoid the popular ""30 day challenges"" typically found on Facebook / imgur etc. You will either burn out or injure yourself with those; typically they do not allow for enough time for rest and recovery.

Practically every fitness magazine will be featuring a much more sensible program tailored for beginners on their Dec / Jan issues. Choose any of those."
