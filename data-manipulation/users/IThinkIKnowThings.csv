The first Klee Kais, bred from a Husky and an American Eskimo Dog, were considered a medium breed (Terrier-sized.)

Back in the early days of the internet, just as the web was gaining mainstream appeal, people who got online for the first time and gravitated towards Facebook seemed to experience the Internet ""differently.""

I always felt like they were missing out on something important. The Internet's early adopters all knew what malicious popups, phishing scams and trolling looked like by that point. But these newcomers were completely oblivious, closed off in their little Facebook bubble as they were. As a teenager I had to start policing *my parents'* Internet activity because of their proclivity to trust everything they read online.

I think it's still much the same problem today. There's just this class of people who never developed critical thinking skills when it comes to the Internet, and who congregate in echo chambers on services like Facebook. And their ranks are growing.

And now Facebook's ultimate goal is to *become* the Internet. Essentially they don't want people to ever have to leave their little walled garden. And I think that's just going to exacerbate the situation."

So they prefer stuff like therapy in adult cases of suspected ADHD. And if you request or even inquire about medication at any time you're often branded as a potential prescription abuser. Medication is an absolute last resort in adult cases because the perceived potential for abuse is high.

It's much easier to get medicated treatment if you're diagnosed at a young age. Doctor's are more apt to medicating children, and are prone to just ""stick with what's working"" as they age."
