Your child will likely be targeted as well, but now it's DNA specific frequency tracking. This is a passive data collection system still being developed but has been implemented. Millions of citizen's physical and personal data is being collected and archived. This includes emotional/thought frequency. For about every thousand passive subjects there is one subject that is also monitored by agents and subject to additional input and variables.

An implant TI in Boston got a degausser and kept shutting down the implants. Eventually he died young. They will kill you if you prove to be a highly resistant subject who wrecks tech.

There's nowhere to run or hide, unless you can survive in the deep wilderness. They can get to you at any time and you won't even notice.
Using the mylar around the perimeter of the home is the safest way to reduce the transfer of information without becoming a defective subject slated for disposal, i.e. someone who has implants destroyed or removed. 

Take note of invasive or destructive thoughts and odd tinnitus symptoms. Using music, meditation and singing bowls can reduce the impact of these artificial symptoms caused by frequency attacks.

The tinfoil hat is actually bad for you, especially if you have routers and microwaves in the house or use smartphones. The EMF/RF signals will be expanded and repeated under the foil, magnifying the effects on your brain.

A really effective way to block signals at home is to line every wall/ceiling/floor with mylar emergency blankets. Yes, it looks as crazy as the tin hat. But it works 100% to block all kinds of signals, including smart-meters and cell towers. If it's possible to identify one direction from which signals are from it might work to just block that area. Make sure all the sheets are taped together and grounded on each wall. Grounding is a wire clipped on the mylar and plugged into the ground hole of an outlet.

Attending to the implant with a de-magnetizer may help. But your vids say you are being gang stalked as well so it's likely they'll just replace the implant.

TW: terrible words, anger

Women aren't supposed to behave aggressively or angrily. To do so is Taboo.

*LOL!*

I've never met a woman who wasn't angry. It seems to bloom under restrictions. Humans, all, I suppose.

Damned if most of them would recognize it. It manifests in fucked up ways. We're always tucking and folding it somehow.

I've met many who disliked me for expressing my anger and use of profanity.

I found their repressions, denials and manipulations more mentally ill than my c-ptsd & depression.

Seeking the truth and missing invisible etiquette made me a pariah -- or sacrificial clown.

So many social norms are BONKERS to me. I never fit with 90% of social groups I found myself in. First and foremost my family. I tried to be part of their sports cults but I was a cripple in denial. I wasn't allowed to rest. I waded through infections on threat from mom's backhand.

My spinal cord was eviscerated for over four inches. The nerve bundle exposed all over. A crease where it was bent, trapped in the thoracic spine. Heart level effects all nerves below. Excruciating. Paralytic. Completely in my head. Mind over matter.

I WAS A LITTLE MOODY. A bit weird.

I was raised by angry mom. Alone in the angry penis world. I was taught everything was crisis, hopeless, unstable, violent, cold & fake. Rage and manipulation facts of daily life. Trusting the wrong people, fucking up with all the right ones. Grasping. Suspicious. Too trusting. Willfully Helpless & ignorant. Naive. Sexualized from toddler-hood. Taught my only value was my tits and hair. Unable to step into myself.

In addition to the emotional trauma, I lived in near constant pain. Also periods of severe spasms. It was an undiagnosed spinal cord injury from infancy. Later I fractured my neck diving into a pool. Also never treated.

I was ignored, mocked or beaten when I'd beg for relief, the hospital, help, anything. I was called a liar, drama queen.

The emotional stuff causes dissociation, most of us know this. But physical pain is also avoided. I practiced this throughout my life.

I spent too much time out of sync with my body & this reality.

I transmuted that with dancing, singing and making art, music and writing. My whole life's work just to make it through this fucking PAIN. I'd stretch and dance to cope with the pain. Coping in all my weird ways made me an outcast.

The disability and coping mechanisms went unchecked for decades. Things got really bad in my 30's. Finally the bizarre horrors explained. Operations made everything far, far worse.

Never being believed, shunned, constantly misunderstood and smeared -- WHY THE FUCK WOULD I EVEN TRY ANYMORE!

I lost any kind of social mooring I'd adapted. Life was suddenly a small perimeter. The end threatens from all directions. I attacked the world back in my writing and art.

I learned how to stop exiting so much and live in my body. In the full structural nightmare of pain.

Then energy dropped another notch. Only room for what my kids need. Have to rest most of the day. I let so much go. Energy is precious. Have to let the dog out. Gotta rest for that.

Yup! So angry. So many years. Never lost the love in my heart. Feels like that's what I've been fighting for all this time.

Mostly bedridden now. Fighting *unbelievable* number of health problems - (hypochondriac liars don't get a lot of support either) - but still manning up everyday and even bitching on line with you lovely people. And all your pets.

And your stories that prove I wasn't one lost soul but a part of a sea...lost in an epidemic.

I've come to terms with the physical realities. Established authentic boundaries.

I've reached a level of peace with the madness of it all. In healing I see the darkness of my past anger more objectively.

I finally understand why everyone was so scared or critical.

Some of that work and behavior -- yikes. So much forgiveness for myself was found in raising children.

When we don't need to be angry cunts, we won't. Fact is, everyone's screaming. No reason why being a woman or crippled should stop me. Our stories matter.

Dog bless all us fucking beautiful wrecked creatures. Keep shining that light into this fuckhole world.

unpopularopinion,fezx2d5,t1_fezvzem,1579462792.0,"Yeah. If we work with it instead of being freaked out about it, we can find some resolution to things like that. We carry a lot of psychic weight that we kind of toss out of sight of mind. But it's always there and sometimes it's really ready to be examined and let go. Cannabis is far more connected to healing the human body and mind than we've been allowed to believe."

unpopularopinion,fezvkig,t3_er0qfn,1579462219.0,"This is arguably one of cannabis' healing effects. The herb is useful in de-constructing unconscious fears. 

Because our culture sees it as a party, good time substance, it's seen as a negative side effect.

In reality this is the plant clearing a path to buried emotions as a gift to us.

It is a meditative process that starts with the unfounded thoughts and anxiety OP describes. When we trace that panic back to it's source we are able to heal damage that's been holding us back, often unconsciously."

I'm not talking about one person, one group, I'm talking about the way it works all over, which I've already said multiple times. But I shouldn't have to even explain that. Bye mayonnaise, done with you."

conspiracy,fezs7rw,t1_fezp8xv,1579460976.0,"It's a conspiracy when they work together for a secret agenda that serves their group - It's got nothing to do with what I like or don't like, it's the way things are."
conspiracy,feznstu,t1_fezkzzn,1579459445.0,"I didn't say a thing about conspiracy. My point is conformist membership is a form of conditioning that trains people to join groups.  Ironically you mention two social groups that have a large majority of people in secretive societies such as the Masons, Kiwanis, etc. 

The conspiracy begins when membership in these groups gives people advantages in employment or social situations. And that's a HUGE conspiracy that effects some of the most influential industries in the world.

CPTSD,fezh865,t3_eqzjix,1579457319.0,"They won't accept people with any health conditions. They won't help you find pure product. There is no website or database to refer reputable practitioners. I'm glad it worked for you, I believe it does work, but it's almost impossible for anyone also physically effected by severe trauma - injuries and conditions - to be helped through MAPS at this time. They won't accept people with spinal cord injuries, fibromyalgia, Me/CFS, diabetes or even high blood pressure or cholesterol. Perfect health only."
