Sure the drug industry may have tested them sideways and like the chemical industry, claim their single chemical is as safe as houses - but again, quit getting stuck on the bit you have the talking points for. Time to go outside the comfort zone with this. I'm not talking about if women were ONLY exposed to estrogen. It's NOT the only chemical in the cancer equation. Others act as disruptors that can activate oncogenes and it doesn't matter how safe ONE substance is, it's the ""concert"" of all of them, that's the issue.

Said that since the first post. Context my friend. Understand it. What I meant when I wrote there's a *trifecta*. Win, place and motherfucking show.

Truthfully we don't know the entire picture with the *xenoestrogens* - hell, even the plastics manufacturers themselves freely admit multiple chemical exposures have effects they do not fully understand. (I work with industrial paints, liquified plastics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, resins and their associated solvents and have for 40 years) There are upwards of 7,000 new molecules put on the market each year and less than 10% are tested against each other, let alone against drugs or even in a human body where the liver can disassemble polymers into base molecules in mere minutes. Many are lipophilic and have xenoestrogenic effects and what they do in the body is a mystery. Talk to any endocrinologist about plastics, obesity and hormones."

The real push to college came in the late 80's when the Higher Education Gravy Train came rolling into towns with the slick advertising and the big universities started tarting up their schools like luxury resorts for the middle class folks that absolutely wanted the 'best' for their darling sons and daughters and the die was cast. Like lemmings they marched right into that maw and it's been consuming younger Americans ever since.

Why anyone would choose a private University when they're so overpriced is beyond me. Part of a side effect of no longer teaching home economics and finance in high school *seriously* as it was taught up to the mid 80's. I honestly think it was cut out of many schools curricula because it taught economic security and oh God no, can't have *that*!

Get 'em out the door and make them leveraged debtors and you can bend 'em over and fuck 'em in the ass for *decades*.. And this is where we are at with it..

When most of the loan is handed over to the banks and loan companies that service the debt, that capital goes to the top investors in these firms, not the greater nation as a whole.

At what point does the accumulation of wealth into the hands of those who hoard capital start to collapse the economy? We're soon to find out if things do not change. One person with a billion dollars generates less economic activity than 100,000 people with $10,000 each. The billionaires earn that capital off of the 100,000, but the economy is no longer creating real wealth, the bankers are now just giving the public more debt.. and being leveraged is NOT being solvent or secure.

MacOS,fdd0bfm,t3_eknven,1578289807.0,"Let me quantify a few things about the 32-bit app situation. 

Rants are fine and all that, but many of us, haven't been on the good end of the economy, and buying new software, when the code we have meets our needs perfectly, is just not economically viable. 

A computer is a tool. I don't need to replace it every year and at times can be resentful for the insistent push to consume on a stakeholder-profit driven schedule. 

I bought Apple because for the work I do, it's the best tool with the longest lifespan possible. Dual-boot option and multiple drives with the OSes that work with the programs I need. I'm using Snow Leopard as my daily driver with Rosetta to run the nearly 20-year old PPC painting programs I depend on. Also, I like them and am comfortable with them and send my time creating, not searching for where the submenus with *that* particular tool got moved to..

YES, users should be aware that the migration away from 32-bit has arrived, and to navigate that change will take some fast footwork - like running an older MacOS in virtualisation - I hear it's a possibility - and it can be done? If not now, it will be soon.

Hell, I bought a G3 new in 1998, and in 2004 did the unsupported XPostFacto install of Tiger 10.4, so I could stretch the value I got out of the first version of Photoshop (5.5) that I paid handsomely for, and also to learn the new OS X systems. Stuck with that machine (the 'Frankenbeige') until 2007 and then got a MacPro1,1 and PSCS3 at the same time and am still using Photoshop. 

Much to my delight, it does run on the 2010 MacBook with Dosdude1's unsupported Mojave install I have, though the OS crabs about the app being 32-bit. Not interested AT ALL in renting something I already own, thankyouverymuch Adobe - but no. 

As with the other, much older PPC apps I use - for the painting programs esp. - I have 15+ years of custom-built brushes that serve my needs. The MacBook with Mojave is used to faff around on just to stay on top of the OS changes. (I'm honestly underwhelmed by the OS changes - the iCloud stuff is of ZERO interest or use for my situation and only do online purchases with it.)

I have finally found the trick to exporting the Painter brushes and have been collecting ones for PSCS3 that are close enough to work.. and finally, some brilliant developer has created a program to run my 21 year old 12x12 Wacom Intuos under Mojave and it's got the full setup with brush dynamics, pressure and application assignments! That will be the next install, to the spare unused El Cap partition on the second MacPro drive - My February project, I think! (either that, or the replacement of the GPU in my 17"" 2008 MacBook Pro with the old PowerBook form factor - port central! - that's got the dual boot of Snow Leopard and Mojave on it. I need that back up and running again... Decisions, decisions!)

People only need to dig into their options before they leap on any upgrade, is all. 

At some point I may try Catalina - but it won't be likely until I get a faster, newer Mac that can run a virtual copy of a 32-bit MacOS. Is it complicated? At times - Christ, using XPostFacto to get Tiger on the beige was an exercise in patience and diligence, but it did give me a fearlessness about trying to work out how to get around the roadblocks. In the long run, it's only been a bonus, to learn how to custom install systems on hardware that's not built for it."
MacOS,fdcovk8,t3_eklvg4,1578280312.0,"Everything should be fine for the upgrade - but as always, BACK THE LIBRARY UP!

Then no matter what.. it will always be safe. (I incrementally back up my library every 2 months if I've added new music.)

Also, if you are concerned, there is nothing stopping you from moving the library to a non-default location. For whatever reason, a library that isn't in the default doesn't seem to have the disappearing problems. Since I lost my first library back in 2003, I've defaulted to a root-level directory on my drive - and have not lost a single bit (literally) of data. 

*Now my systems all run with multiple partitions and multiple drives and the library is on different machines across the house. The main library is hosted on a PowerMac G4 that I use with an audiophile soundcard to rip my vinyl with. Once a year I merge all the libraries across the network."

I certainly didn't take his original statement as such. It came across as one of excitement that the kids appreciated the machine and saw it as he did - a cool old device. Many kids today wouldn't give an old machine such as this a second glance - hell, many adults wouldn't either.

This is a general thing, not tied to any generation or age, (and yeah, I've been guilty of it myself, in the past), but do learn to accept people's words as they are meant and not apply your own inference to them.

I didn't say anything was going to happen for them, there will be no grand animal rescue or airlift dropping food afterwards - it possibly can't, so no help is coming beyond the few that are near where they can get snatched up by a passing person and whisked to safety and shelter. 

For the rest - so far the estimate is 500 million - they will be - and have been - burned alive and killed by the flames.

I watched a video last night and one of the interviewees stated the burnt out husk of a house he was pointing to just had sold for over a million. Yupscale. 

Yeah, these folks are like the ones up in the Rockies out in the US west. Or the people that live on the Missouri and Mississippi *flood plains* and are shocked when they get washed out or the ones in Florida who are on the coast and get hit by hurricanes and lose it all.

I grew up on a farm and we raised our own pigs for meat and I just can't stand the blandness of industrial pork so I generally don't eat it much.

This takes me back to the early 90's when I had a 14 foot mast with a rotor and a 10-foot ChannelMaster antenna on it. In the early mornings I could point the antenna south and pick up channel 3 out of Hartford or point it northwest and get channel 3 out of Burlington, Vt. I'm in Portsmouth, NH and both stations are over 130 miles away.

66 - WVJV (""V66"" they played music videos almost exclusively at the start in the mid-80's but it became WHSH later on and ended up a home shopping channel - blecch..)

68 - WQTV - which ran adult movies that were scrambled but could be unscrambled with a box converter that could be built with parts from Radio Shack - that phase of it's programming didn't last long..

Also used to get something called 'companion radio' which was a faint FM station that was played in-house at a nearby nursing home, it's line-up was music from the 30's to the 50's, commercial free. By the mid-90s the roll out of high speed cable internet created such a RF noise cloud that the channel reception fell away by an incredible amount. That and a super hella wind storm that took down the antenna was it for me. :( I really miss the FM radio channels I could get."
