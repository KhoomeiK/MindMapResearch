AskReddit,ffgici4,t1_ffggnen,1579906900.0,"The problem with feminism is that it's not one voice. *Your* feminism stands for equal rights. Someone else's feminism could stand for something different - for women's rights exclusively, for women-except-MtF-transgender-women, against men's rights, for women's rights first and *then* men's rights, whatever.

Feminism's biggest issue today, I think, is that we never stopped to define what ""equal"" is. It was easy, back when women were fighting for suffrage or the right to work outside the home, to say ""THAT'S NOT EQUAL!"" But... what about college admission rates? What about homelessness? What about areas that are fundamentally unequal like pregnancy, or jobs where gender/sex matter? What about areas where neither gender has it good enough, like maternity/paternity leave?

I agree with you, fundamentally, that women deserve equal rights. But I have a suspicion that if we were to chart out what that actually *means*, we'd run into conflict or two over what ""equal"" really is."

Making the entire reveal about it being a hub was a *bad* idea. The people interested in the XBox One reveal were primarily gamers, you don't see a lot of ""Wine and Netflix"" moms clamoring for a video game console. The focus should have been on the XBox One being for the whole family - with immersive games for the gamers, party games via Kinect for the whole family, and easy access to a large library of other entertainment via streaming and blu-ray for the non-gamers in the family. *That* could have gone over well with the idea of it being the ""One"" entertainment hub you need for your living room.

Instead they focused very heavily on the multimedia, a bit on Halo, a lot on sports, and had their infamous ""we have a console for people who don't want to be online all the time - it's the XBox 360"" line."

That being said, I was being a bit facetious about the degree in question. I do have a friend who majored in Japanese Culture though (before switching to CS, which turned out well - she's a good programmer). I wouldn't be surprised if that degree exists somewhere. But there's a long list of ""normal"" degrees like art or social sciences that are very narrow and not in very high demand. Women's studies may be important to our culture, but unless you're planning to go into teaching or political activism it's not really applicable to most industries (*maybe* to HR?).

Well, technically his minister of agriculture, Earl ""Rusty"" Butz. No, I'm not making that up. He wanted to stabilize food prices, so he changed the rules around our agriculture policy. Previously, we would loan farmers money to keep their corn off the market, which they would pay back once the price got high enough that they could sell it at a profit. He made it so now we *subsidize it*, so they sell the corn for whatever they can get and the government guarantees them a minimum price."

As others have pointed out, you really went way overboard on an unwanted party with too many cupcakes designed to drag on endlessly.

You're right, he shouldn't *need* to be thanked for taking care of the kid. It's his kid too. 

But you do need to keep in mind that his job is *also* stressful. He needs time to de-stress after work as well, time which he gave up to help you. And while I know you said ""I put in *way* more than 40 hours a week taking care of the baby""... if we're going to include everything he does that isn't recreation I expect we could say the same about him.

It sounds like you two need to get on the same page when it comes to splitting marital duties. He probably does need to pick up more tasks around the household. But you need to help him figure that out, things that may be obvious to you may not be even visible to him and vice versa."
