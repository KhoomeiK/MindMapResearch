ReefTank,fea7rnx,t3_eo63qo,1578945358.0,"Great choice! Ricordea Coral are one of my favorite.

The care is straight forward. From my experience they are hardy.

Low light and low flow should do the trick. Mine also benefit from target feeding Reef Roids."
ReefTank,fea58xb,t3_eo8fu0,1578944517.0,For people reading correct me if I’m wrong but all wrasses eat small inverts it just depends on the size of the wrasse?
ReefTank,fe9xjs5,t1_fe9j6pn,1578942298.0,"Reason I ask is because Kenya tree is hard to kill.

I manhandle mine when I move it and then it bounces back the next day.

Let us know how yours does"
ReefTank,fe9bzzt,t3_eo6owm,1578936203.0,"What’s your salinity at? Move it to a shaded area.

Is your tank cycled?"
woodworking,fe06ymw,t3_eniw2m,1578804668.0,How hard/expensive is this to make? I’d also love to make one. This ones great!
ReefTank,fe01ga2,t3_enathx,1578800716.0,Saw your tank on IG. How does your cable management look
ReefTank,fe0195y,t3_enathx,1578800586.0,Incredible
ReefTank,fe012ww,t3_enhozf,1578800482.0,Your tank looks very new. Have you cycled the tank? How long have you had it
ReefTank,fdx1u55,t3_en86az,1578764447.0,Bonsai acro with retracted polyps
ReefTank,fds7lv0,t3_emspjm,1578696172.0,What’s the care requirements for it? I have a moderate- high flow area that’s shaded by Monti cap that might be perfect for it
ReefTank,fds695g,t3_emxf5p,1578695294.0,"What are your parameters at? 

I’m sure you know about the cycle a tank goes through and how high nitrite during the cycle can kill living creatures."
ReefTank,fdojwf0,t3_emd6tj,1578606633.0,Do you have any pics from the front of the tank
ReefTank,fdfxmnf,t3_el4lrf,1578373041.0,Best guess is it’s an encrusting montipora with retracted polyps
ReefTank,fdfxg9r,t3_el5n8i,1578372887.0,"I don’t understand the question. Do you mean if you use RO/DI water do you have to use a salt mix?

If so yes"
ReefTank,fdfjcp4,t3_el0ej7,1578363061.0,"Personally, I’d buy a new 10g tank and fill it with 7-9g of new saltwater. Depending on how much displacement of water the rock and equipment take up. Place the live stock in the new tank asap.

Keep the old tank water and put a little bit in a bucket (keep the water in the tank heated to temperature) grab a tooth brush and rinse the rock in the bucket (repeat with all rock until you get little algae left, remember to keep the rock submerged in water as close to temp as possible). Rinsing all rock shouldn’t take longer then 10 minutes.

Place rock in the new tank. Clean out filter media with the exception of rinsing sponges in old tank water. You want to leave out as much detritus as you can + unsightly algae.

Once everything is set up in the new system if you have gha buy some reef flux and use one tablet. You should see results on 2 weeks.

For such a small tank the thing that will make the biggest difference is low bioload through liberal feedings and water changes.

Also, if you want sand I’d wait on it until you haven’t seen algae for a month or else you’ll be fighting algae with sand. Which is a pain in the ass."
college,fdfh1vm,t3_el3kjh,1578361515.0,"It’s similar. It’s encouraged to ask the teacher questions in person after class during their office hours, through a math lab, or through email.

I’ve emailed professors on problems that I didn’t get."
ReefTank,fdfbqh0,t1_fdf6dn1,1578357939.0,I needed to stock up on a mixing station. Thank you for posting.
ReefTank,fdei67z,t1_fddlza0,1578339546.0,It is. If you’ve seen the size of those thermometers you can tell it’s a small tank.
ReefTank,fdcmpni,t3_ekm5mc,1578278739.0,"I feed before water change day which is once a week.

I have LPS and SPS and one acro. I’d feed more often if I had a sump with refugium with a macro algae as well as a larger protein skimmer.

My tank is 10g"
ReefTank,fd3sjwm,t3_ejyzke,1578161325.0,"Looks like red slime algae.

Coraline looks more solid in appearance. As others have said can you spray it off with a turkey baster?"
college,fd004wi,t3_ejjmmx,1578111620.0,Yes! I’m ready to crush it. At first I loathed it but now that I have my rhythm I’m ready for it!

Your best bet is buying used."
ReefTank,fcv4wkt,t1_fcu5xci,1577994713.0,"You have the right idea, take a look at coral hawk fish if you like the carnivorous look. (Not known you be good with inverts, but does well with my ceriths and tuxedo urchin)"

ReefTank,fct7hq3,t1_fct72c2,1577934910.0,"What have you seen as far as growth in terms of higher vs lower lighting?

I’ve seen some in higher lighting for the most part they have been retracted.

I don’t acclimate hammers I own. The hammers I transfer from my 40B to my 10g. The temp difference is 2 degrees Fahrenheit.

New hammers get a float and drop in the tank treatment. Which is fine.

Same method I transfer my sps with no ill effects."
ReefTank,fcsscl8,t1_fcsjfum,1577923885.0,I have a tuxedo urchin in my 40B I'll see how he does in my 10g. The hermits I'm wondering if my dwarf hawkfish will attack him.
ReefTank,fcsilqa,t1_fcp2ywx,1577917202.0,I’ve done peroxide dip. Treating with fluconazle has been the best treatment imo besides hydrogen peroxide treating with ear picks which imo is better

But my 40B has no CuC besides an urchin and it’s thriving."

ReefTank,fcouvrr,t1_fcobi4f,1577842214.0,"That's what I'm banking on, I added fluconazole to battle off some gha on frags but other then that I'm going with stability.

The question is if letting the algae flourish until it starves itself is the best idea or constantly scraping, blowing the rocks of the algae and removing is the answer."
