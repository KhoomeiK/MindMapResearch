PublicFreakout,ff4atqt,t1_ff3vhbu,1579559308.0,My childhood dog saved me from the neighborhood bully. He was a wrestler and would always try to get me to wrestle him even though I was half his size and a few years younger. One day he decided to force me to wrestle him and was choking me out and my dog heard and jumped the fence ran down the street and shoulder checked him off of me. He stood bearing his teeth over the kids throat till I called him off. He never messed with me again. German shepherds arent to be fucked with.

todayilearned,feqc63d,t3_eq7dy6,1579340074.0,How many of you know the story of scarface the bear who ate like $15 million dollars of coke and then died and was stuffed and made his way all over the world.
todayilearned,fekxuuq,t1_fekn4cp,1579209852.0,We were a family of five living in a tiny two bedroom apartment. One of my earlier memories was them talking about how the cheap gallon ice cream bucket we used to hold the oats you can get from the bulk section only had enough for one more day and my mim crying while my dad hugged her and said it he would figure it out. He must have because I don't ever remember going hungry.
todayilearned,fekkobg,t3_epmmmk,1579202044.0,Since I was a child I have had dreams like this. Probably because I grew up poor. Hearing my parents talk about money problems while I slept on couch cushions in the living room floor and they thought I was asleep. I always wake up right before being able to turn whatever treasure I've found into money that can be used.

funny,fe9okqm,t3_eo3dan,1578940023.0,When I was a kid we hit black ice in a mountain pass. Hours from any hospital. We spun out of the fast lane and were hit by a semi truck in the lane next to us. We then flew into the median shattering whatever windows remained. Somehow I was the only one cut but a piece of glass had gone through my face and out my mouth leaving me with a joker like gash from the inside corner of my lip halfway up my cheek. There was a plastic surgeon in one of the cars behind the semi that hit us and he sewed me up on the side of the freeway in the snow. I now have an adorable dimple instead of a horrendous scar because of his quick work and preparedness. Crazy thing was he was supposed to leave the day before to visit his mother but she had called and told him she had a weird feeling he shouldn't go that day and to come tomorrow! Which put him in the car behind us!
AskReddit,fdsa9ou,t3_ejr5rg,1578697963.0,My family is part of an independent fundamental baptist cult. When one of the leaders killed an acquintance of mine and the son of one of my nursing home ministry attendants. The cult celebrated the life of the murderer because he was one of the leaders and they claimed anyone who said anything bad about him was trying to tarnish the name of christ. When I started speaking out against them for paying for his lavish funeral and setting up a college fund in his name; but did nothing for the victims family. They chased me from my home. They tried to turn my family against me telling them and my work that I was a drug addict. I came very close to literally setting that place on fire.
