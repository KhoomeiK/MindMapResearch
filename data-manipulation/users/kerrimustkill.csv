Their interaction was the best, and they both gained something from it. I like it when people are nice. But I also like that she just blatantly calls them crazy, she's got balls."
AskReddit,fgq36qx,t1_fgpj5ii,1581016999.0,"My rapist went on to become a cop. I wish I was a stronger person at 15 and reported it, but I was just so upset with myself. Maybe he wouldn't have this position of power today if I had. It's one of my only regrets."

I've smoked too much weed."
unpopularopinion,fggthqw,t1_fggt1oi,1580769199.0,"There's lots of accents. I don't think it's racist to acknowledge our differences. I think believing these differences make them inferior or bad makes it racist. But let me know, I'm always down to learn!"

SandersForPresident,fg2rqjj,t3_ewjk43,1580453224.0,"Welcome, compadre! I feel like a lot of us here have the same story. I’ve always voted blue but I didn’t vote in the last election because I couldn’t get behind Hillary and all her backroom deals and  dirty politics. I feel most informed people now can’t totally side with either party. Despite the different popular and “moral” veneer of each party, it’s totally apparent that both parties are slaves to the 1%. They don’t care about the welfare of the people, they cater to the billionaires and the corporations. 

Well, fuck that. I’m disgusted that people are having to choose death or total financial ruin. I can’t believe there are billionaires who pay nothing in taxes while our civil servants go without fair pay or adequate training and resources. And I’m through with being fed distractions while social issues of immense importance are being swept under the rug in favor of making more money. 

Please, Cthulhu!!! Give us Bernie Sanders as President!"
AskReddit,fg1y9tb,t1_fg1nwce,1580435027.0,"Dude, yes! My Mom had a pretty decent paying job with the government but with only one source of income it didn’t go far. And she used spending money as a way to fake being happy. Despite the cheating, despite the verbal and physical abuse towards her AND her children she still didn’t leave until all of the kids were all out of the house.  I love my Mom, I even like her; but I was SO pissed off at her for the longest time. 

And my Mom was so bad with budgeting the money. There was a period of about 4 years where there were no payments to the gas company. That meant no heat in winter and no hot water. Luckily our stove was electric but I don’t think that would have mattered. When there was food in the house I made do, but otherwise it was fast food all the time. That shit is so gross now bc if that. 

But you sound like you did pretty well in spite of things. I feel like there’s two ways you can go, you can learn from it or lean into it. I hope you and your siblings are all doing good now!"
AskReddit,fg1lxo3,t1_fg1fi0a,1580429470.0,"Aw, thanks! Most of that determination came about because of my two younger sisters, to be honest. And a lot of anger, lol. Thankfully I’ve dropped most of that anger for dark humor and righteous indignation."
AskReddit,fg1f3wy,t3_ewe327,1580425972.0,"Don’t be a gross, alcoholic, drug abusing asshole who mooches off of people and can’t hold down a job while simultaneously blaming everyone else for their problems. If the sperm doner who called himself my “Dad” taught me anything, it was to be the opposite of everything he was about. So, don’t be a racist, don’t abuse animals or people weaker than yourself (or anyone else for that matter but he never tried to fight able-bodied men), and don’t be a mooch. 

Oh yeah, and he also showed me the worst that humanity has to offer. But my Mom and my sisters showed me the best that humanity has to offer. I also matured much faster and learned life skills such as cooking and cleaning out of necessity, so I guess that’s another point for him."

AskReddit,ffhcemm,t1_ffh7ozo,1579929763.0,You can't force people to change just because you want them to or even yell at them. Sometimes escalation just draws a target on yourself. The most important thing is that u/Burritos_ByMussolini does what he feels is right and best for him. Some people aren't fighters. You don't have to be. There are multiple ways to solve a problem.

Dave went back home to get help from his family. His father told him to take the car to the mechanic to fix the dent and the damage. His mother, Louise, went to hide Tim's body. She found him unresponsive and with multiple traumatic injuries. She dragged him 10 feet and rolled him into a ditch filled with 2 feet of brown water. Tim Barrett ultimately died from drowning, despite his multiple injuries."

AskReddit,ffh2wo8,t1_ffh0nfb,1579921654.0,"I was wrong, you're a great person. And u/1SneakyCookie1 is totally right, these people are jealous and trying to cope with unhappiness or their own lack of self worth. They choose to bring others down in order to bring themselves up. Those are the actions of small minded people. 

I don't know how to tell you to ignore them. I would certainly doubt myself on certain days when the majority are making fun of me. 

While I believe in the best in people I am also highly aware that people are flawed and will sadly compromise their dignity for acceptance. Don't doubt yourself, you really do sound super cool."

Maybe I'm biased because of the type of kids I'm around, but I love how passionate and accepting kids are today!"
AskReddit,ffh14y7,t1_ffgtj6h,1579920319.0,"First of all, u/bitofgrit, you suck and are wrong. Secondly, u/Burritos_ByMussolini, you are right. The first person who gets mad loses. Keep your principles and don't conform because of the opinions of losers."
AskReddit,ffh0bwx,t1_ffgqi58,1579919702.0,"You seem like a very thoughtful person who gives other people's words and opinions more importance than your own. You are the protagonist of your story. Learn to accept yourself and loving yourself might follow.

I'm sorry, I like to play armchair psychiatrist but I'm going on the very little information that you have provided. I hope you find a way to be happy because you sound like a nice person."
AskReddit,ffgz8yt,t1_ffgpl8c,1579918891.0,"Don't follow through with their mantra. You spend a lot of time at your place of employment and it can affect your life outside of the job. You deserve to be happy. These people suck and you should be happy wherever you are. You can't change people, they're gonna suck regardless. But you can do something to make yourself happy. I'm sorry that you might have to change employment in order to avoid assholes. That's not something you should have to do. But you're not running, you're choosing to improve your life. Good luck my friend!"
AskReddit,ffgyes5,t1_ffgs85o,1579918263.0,"I love that you call your dad a sperm donor. That's exactly the extent my dad contributed (in a ""good"" way). He was around until I was in my 20's and was a violent,drunken mooch the entire time."
AskReddit,ffgv7pi,t1_ffgsi55,1579915902.0,"My fiancée(male) is extremely emotional, and that's ok. He becomes overwhelmed by his feelings and will cry from something that will not make me(female) have as strong an emotional response. And that's ok, because that's how he feels. I was one of the first people to accept his emotions as normal. We don't exist on a straight line. Particles don't even do that. 

And pain is pain. It needs to be processed. Some might have an easier time ignoring pain just like some people have an easier time processing it. But acting like it shouldn't exist? Like you have no agency over your body or your right to say no? We need to accept that as we move toward the [CORRECT] notion that we are all equally varied and similar despite our background, race, sex, etc, that this ALSO includes men! 

If women can be strong, then men can be weak. If women can be tough, then men can be soft. People don't exist on a continuum based on our societal, regional, economic, or sexually differences. Quit excluding men when we talk about acceptance. It's fucking toxic."

Do you guys have any boxes of stuff stored away that you know your mom won't go thru? Like Christmas decorations or extra clothing or linen that's already packed up? Stow away your items there and retrieve them later."

Tell them you were told to call back to set up an interview. If they happen to ask you who called you tell them you can't remember, you're bad with names. There's almost always multiple managers and a lack of communication. I have done this on 3 separate occasions and each time it worked.

AskMen,fdmhbv3,t1_fdmdaqo,1578549914.0,"Reddit is kinda weird like that. You get a chance to shoot your shot and sometimes it comes off great and other times, well, I've been down voted too for my comments. The exchange of ideas requires two sides: one side to put forth an idea and another side to interpret it. There's a lot of ways that an idea can be incorrectly interpreted.

But most of all I think it's important for us to not limit ourselves to our bubble of interpretation and experience. How else are we supposed to become better neighbors if we don't interact and exchange our lives with each other? I love Reddit because, while it is a microcosm, it allows us to interact and learn and grow closer because we are willing to hear and be heard. 

I got what you were trying to say, victimhood is often something we will give to people without knowing how they view themselves. We have come to the idea of victimhood without asking the person how they see themselves. Maybe this status is demeaning to some, but I think the intention is one of empathy and how we would feel if put in their place. We"
AskMen,fdluwiy,t1_fdlsn44,1578533065.0,"I think that it just depends on how much of a willing participant you are. Willingness is obvious: consent has been given and you are fully aware of what is happening. But participant is also necessary because you may think you're ready and want something but when the maturity or power levels are drastically skewed then you may come to realize that you may have been coerced or pressured into doing something that wasn't good for you in the long run.

We've come to see willingness as necessary but only certain dynamics of participation are deemed inappropriate and only certain participants are considered victims. Ie, rape is bad unless it's a prisoner then it's just desserts."
