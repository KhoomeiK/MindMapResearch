That's why you'll see lots of people mentioning butter, peanut butter, coconut oil, etc. If you take it with one of these, everything will digest better.

If you choose to take it with peanut butter, don't get that cheap bottom shelf stuff, you need peanut butter with a high peanut content and plenty of oils laying on top when you open it. The cheap stuff is less peanut, more sugar; you don't want that, you want the natural peanut oils in there. 

Have fun!"

Prices are just about to change, within the next month you'll have a new generation out, and with that, the current gen will become last gen and its value will drop.

Just wait a month, then you can either get an s11/s20, or get an s10 cheaper than you can right now, it's a win/win. What's a month anyway?"

PSVR,ffgh1xo,t1_ffgaoel,1579906061.0,"I'm not a fan boy, I'm a gamer, that's the difference between us, I can appreciate games that aren't right in front of me, that aren't current gen vr, what they brought to the table, and how they affected the industry. Rush of blood is a decent game, but it's not exactly ground breaking. Hell, I played vr on rails 25 years ago. All rush of blood done was bring together an old genre and a new platform. House of The Dead *defined* that genre.

If you honestly can't see the value in redesigning/remastering and releasing something as groundbreaking as a that, to a platform that fits it better than even the original did, then sorry, but you're a fucking idiot."

PSVR,ffg7puh,t1_ffg59x3,1579900260.0,"Confirmed, living under a rock.

And yeah we both played atari then. 

Just because it was your least favourite genre doesn't mean they weren't absofuckinglutely massive, and had a lasting impact that we're still enjoying even now. They paved the way for on rails shooters with actual guns, nothing else came close, and the games you mentioned there pale in comparison. The only one that even comes close is rush of blood, and it's still not nearly as good. 

Why do you think the games I mentioned were restricted to arcades back then? Why do you think they didn't impact consoles at the time? 

Because home platforms couldn't even come close until the dreamcast was released, and even then, they couldn't replicate the accuracy from home based light guns. Other arcade machines tried to keep up, even they couldn't. 

VR is the *perfect* platform to bring genre defining games like these to.

Either of those would be amazing, and they would also be VR sellers, bringing new people to the platform.

It feels like there's currently a lack of games like these. I also have vr on pc and that's the same, if not worse. There are faaaar more games of that type on pc, but they're almost all unpolished indie games."

It's undoubtedly a great handset, but for cost efficiency I'd recommend a step down. That being said, the 11 is out in a few weeks, so 10's price will drop soon, so maybe..."
PickAnAndroidForMe,ffdbxrn,t3_ess7oe,1579817605.0,"I went from a 5s to a galaxy s9+ when it was the current gen and had just came out.

It fits pretty much all of your needs, and it's probably within your price bracket now.

It was a truly tremendous upgrade from the 5s, in almost every way. I had similar requirements to you and have been blown away by almost everything it does, especially the camera and screen quality, amazing. 

That being said, going from a phone the size of an iPhone 5 to one the size of an s9+ requires a big change in how you hold it, store it, etc. And for the first couple of months, you'll feel like you're about to fumble it daily. I was super careful and never dropped it from my hands, but it jumped out of a pocket that the iPhone would've been too small to slide out of, smashed the screen. Thankfully it was insured, as these screens can be expensive."
