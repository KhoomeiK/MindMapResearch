dogs,ffbwam2,t1_ffbb474,1579784886.0,"That's exactly what I mean. I tend to agree with your theory, but when I was thinking about it last night, I was interested in the discussion here (and learned quite a bit!)."
dogs,ffbw73r,t1_ffbm138,1579784799.0,"That is really interesting. At the dog park I used to frequent, there was a very handsome Collie who was 100lb (per the owner). He was enormous, but looked like a ""normal"" Collie otherwise. 

I guess I've always thought an advantage of getting a purebred puppy is that you know what size it'll get to. I also like Dobermans, but I would be a little upset if I got one and it ended up huge. They're a good size as they are, imo. 

I wonder if it's a sort of reaction to the impossibly small toy dogs. Or just the other side of the coin to it."
dogs,ffb8d3u,t1_ffb7x8a,1579754845.0,Yes! Like with those poor German Shepherds who are so hunched over now. I wish the show ring didn't reward such extremities.
dogs,ffb89kl,t1_ffb7ph5,1579754737.0,"Exactly! That's the sort of thing I mean. Huskies are pretty ""small"", but people seem to want them to be wolf sized or something. Or like Malamutes? I'm not sure. There is definitely a discrepancy between standard sizes in dogs and what a normal person seems to expect them to be, if that makes sense. 

The trend over time is sort of what I was wondering, too. People have gotten bigger over time due to better nutrition through childhood, so I wondered if it could be a similar thing with dogs. Or if it was poor breeding or if I was just imagining it, lol. Someone else pointed out that pediatric spaying and neutering can lead to bigger dogs, so I bet that's part of it, too."
dogs,ffb7zy3,t1_ffb7hgx,1579754485.0,"Thank you very much for your answer. I wasn't aware that pediatric spay/neuter led to bigger dogs, but that's probably a pretty decent factor in it. A lot of vets used to recommend it pretty young, but I know people are moving to wait until the dog has matured now (at least, I think. My dog wasn't spayed when I adopted her at 2 years old, though she is now). And it isn't like breeders can control that as much, since their own dogs are intact. 

Vizslas are surprisingly petite compared to pictures! But they're some of my favorites. The oversized male (75lb ish) had resource guarding issues, so I think that's why he's stuck in my mind so much. He was large and then all the others were so dang sweet. 

But I wonder if people are basing their expectations on pictures, which can be deceiving, and not real life experience with the breed. A lot of dogs are a lot different when you're standing there with them than in pictures (like Bernese Mountain Dogs! So huge!), so maybe this has led to some BYB-type people to want to breed to what people expect more. Or something. Hm."
dogs,ffb5hdo,t1_ffb5bpn,1579752315.0,"So then a pet-bred counterpart might seem bigger? That would make a lot of sense too. I do see a lot of Labs, for instance, that look incredibly well-bred and are a little smaller than my dog, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were field-bred."
dogs,ffb5but,t1_ffb59ze,1579752200.0,Could totally be confirmation bias then. Thanks for your input.
DoggyDNA,ff7gw41,t3_ervezz,1579649267.0,Neat! I wonder how often people find surprise purebreds like this??
dogs,ff7c2e8,t1_ff7atr8,1579646040.0,"They might! Even if they give you ""supermutt"", they give you breeds found in it (like my girl has German Shepherd and Collie in her supermutt group, not just breed groups). You can also probably email Wisdom and they should try to give you the top three breeds in that unknown. 

The other breeds would also have more accurate percentages, since they don't round. [This is what my dog's looks like ](https://imgur.com/a/Pmp7Gv7) (I misremembered her highest percentage! whoops) to give an example. 

It is on the pricey side though, and there isn't a guarantee you'd get exact percentages. There are more breeds for them to pull from though."
dogs,ff76xht,t1_ff6ra8g,1579642323.0,"Embark uses Cornell for their labs, and they also have more breeds and more diseases in their database. I did a lot of research between the two and saw a lot of people with a Heinz 57 dogs like mine dissatisfied with Wisdom. Wisdom rounds to the nearest 12.5%. I also appreciate how responsive the vets have been when I had genetic questions, and that they add results as new tests are made. 

Ultimately, I'm glad I shelled out the extra money for Embark. My dog's highest breed percentage is 40% (with like 7 breeds!), so Wisdom would've probably been deeply unsatisfying for me. I think Wisdom is probably perfectly fine if your dog is less mixed than mine."
BanPitBulls,ff568zj,t1_ff4joxv,1579581411.0,"That's what I thought, too. Older and probably poorly bred. It doesn't look like a pit to me, even though the description is common in pitbull posts."
Eyebleach,ff4hmk2,t1_ff4dkkg,1579563825.0,"Honestly, I heard adult current pets (in my case, an adult dog) take best to baby new pets (for me, a kitten). So if you have an adult pet already, I would try a youngster for the new pet. I had great success with this- my two are BFFs."
dogs,ff3xxtp,t1_ff3dffe,1579551277.0,"I second Embark! I am so glad I did it- not only do I have the reassurance of knowing she's clear of over 150 genetic diseases, I also have a better understanding of her behavior and needs. And I only correctly guessed 1 of her 6+ breeds, not even her main one, so it made a big difference!"
DoggyDNA,ff208af,t1_ff1zlfz,1579490347.0,"It just made me chuckle! You can change it under the ""edit"" button that you see under their little bio. I actually just tweaked my girl's birthday to what I think it actually is!"
namenerds,ff1w2pb,t1_ff1ogfp,1579487485.0,"I knew a Katherine Layne! We were in Mississippi, so she used both names."
