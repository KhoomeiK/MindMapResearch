Edit: by pub I mean a place where you will get some food and drinks and to meet friends. By restaurants I mean a place that is a little! bit fancier than a pub. You usually go there to eat, not to drink a lot."
MadeMeSmile,ff3zevn,t1_ff305w4,1579552199.0,It's what calves do too. They headbutt their mum's udders which in turn stimulates milk release by releasing oxytocin in the brain.

popping,fejn91m,t1_feh1zev,1579180568.0,"They usually do. After draining the abscess, flush it with water two or three times until water is clear. Then flush it with betadine twice and it should be fine.
Cows are pretty sturdy unlike horses. They will die from a little scratch :D
If you like that stuff, I can recommend the YouTube channel Cody Creelman Cow Vet. He's not posting much these days but lots of old interesting popping videos on cows."

educationalgifs,fee4d3i,t1_fedpqcr,1579026140.0,Agree. This is a better picture!
educationalgifs,fedphhv,t1_fedje1f,1579017065.0,"Kind of. Looks like [this](https://www.kuechengoetter.de/uploads/media/400x400-kgr/08/71718-kaesespaetzle-mit-knusperzwiebeln.jpg?v=3-33). Here's a [recipe](https://thestayathomechef.com/grannys-german-spaetzle/). But don't add nutmeg and certainly no parsley. Substitute milk with water. That's the way Swabians (people in the south of Germany) make them.
Once the Spätzle are done put them in a deep dish, top with lots! of sharp cheese, broil until cheese is melted. Top with lots of caramelised onions.

Edit: Fixed links"

happycowgifs,fedc5mx,t1_fed1fjj,1579007263.0,"They probably would like it. Seen lots of horses who scratch themselves on tree barks. But horses are able to roll around in the dirt and roll over from one side to another, which a cow can't do due to her anatomy. So for horses it's not as necessary as for cows. Though some horse owners simply screw a broom on a wall for them to give them the opportunity to scratch themselves if they want to. It's a cheap solution, professional cow brushes are expensive (1.500€+)."
happycowgifs,fedbtk2,t1_fectj41,1579006956.0,"Copied from one of my other posts on another subreddit: Cattle, both male and female, always have horns except when they're genetically hornless. And if they're genetically hornless then both males and females are hornless. Having horns has nothing to do with gender in cattle.
As somebody else already mentioned, most of the time cows get dehorned if they're growing horns, males ans females."

educationalgifs,fe8l7a5,t1_fe7fx1f,1578927428.0,"My grandma (German) said that average people couldn't afford or even get their hands on butter during the war. 
Iirc if you owned cows you had to give the milk to the officals and weren't allowed to slaughter it or make butter. My grandma's sister had to work in a hotel where high-ranking politicians stayed (mandatory year of work in agriculture or housekeeping for women under 25). She stole some butter from the hotel from time to time to bring home. Luckily she never got caught."
Cows,fe7ev3x,t1_fe6fyom,1578913645.0,"They probably won't get slaughtered (yet). They look like dairy heifers (young cows, not having born a calf yet), maybe they're on their way to a new owner or another farm."

It's the best soil you can get and farmers usually won't mind if you take the soil from molehills as they just have to flatten them with their machinery. Adding a little bit of compost to the soil won't hurt. It has lots of nutrients for the plant."
DiWHY,fe29x5w,t1_fe18sh9,1578836054.0,A classmate of mine did that in 12th grad (last year of the highest level before graduation in Germany). Except he moved himself on the banana shells. Kinda like ice-skating. The janitor loved that kid. /s
AmateurRoomPorn,fe251un,t1_fe1ylvo,1578834568.0,Plus the walls won't get mouldy if you don't put furniture right on the external walls. Those walls sometimes get wet. Speaking from experience :(
