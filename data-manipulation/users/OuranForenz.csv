danganronpa,ff4xbbi,t1_ff4wc0c,1579574680.0,"Ok ok I'll explain myself.

So prior to her FTEs we see Angie be very bold, abrasive, seemingly uncaring towards others, brazenly confident, and manipulative to those around her using ""Atua"". She just does whatever she wants and feels like she doesn't need to consider anything or anyone else, she easily betrays Himiko in trial two, and she generally appears nice but is mean the second you disagree with her. She ALWAYS has to be right and will force her opinion down everyone's throat.

&#x200B;

Now, while I get how you could find her FTEs disturbing (I personally found them comedic but I understand), they also completely explain all that bad stuff I just talked about. She has always been told all her life that she is special, that she is a seer, and that everything she says is Atua's word and correct beyond a shadow of a doubt. She has spent quite literally her entire life being worshipped as a prophet, and was taught that whatever she said, her own thoughts, were actually from Atua and they were always correct. She also never was close to anyone because she was revered so much. It makes sense how she forces her opinion and is abrasive to those who disagree, as far as she's aware they are just objectively wrong. She's never had to think about what she's saying to analyze its correctness, she's just always been correct. But deep down, she is a nice person, she wants to help. When she takes the flashback lights, its because she legitimately believes it is helping (I agree with her).

&#x200B;

Anyways its that mindset that was drilled into her so much that is so fascinating and explains all of her character so well."

And yeah pregnancy, but like still women don’t have less ambition, it’s not like this thing where men are always looking for conquest and women are more likely to be happy in a lesser position, they just aren’t considered for these higher positions and this mindset you seem to have that men are biologically more fit for higher positions is part of the reason."

Anyways I’m not trying to claim “oh poor white people” this just doesn’t make sense and doesn’t accomplish anything positive.

I have a quote from Knuckles the Echidna, and while it refers to sexism the message is still important. “You know Amy, anytime someone calls attention to the breaking of gender roles, it ultimately undermines the concept of gender equality by pointing out that this is an exception and not the status quo”

There’s a very simple conflict here. If we allow freedom of intolerance, then it strips freedoms from minorities who would face unfounded bigotry. But, if we ban this sort of intolerance then it takes away freedom from the bigots.

Alright now we have the conflict set up, we now must decide which to limit. Should we allow baseless discrimination or should we... not allow baseless discrimination.

If you think the first is better then there’s a problem.

Like what if this law was passed that allowed orphanages to not give children to black peoples. That’s just disgusting because it enables bigotry, we should aim to eliminate bigotry and it should be reflected in our laws.
