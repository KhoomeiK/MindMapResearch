AmItheAsshole,ffbyda4,t3_esnmph,1579786689.0,"So just to clarify:

-You're doing friend a favor by letting her stay at your place while hers is being painted. 


- While staying at your place she saw a quilt on your bed and called it tacky. 


- You agree it's a little loud, but has sentimental value because your deceased mother made it and it's important to you.


- Then, for whatever reason of insanity, she dismisses what you've said and says she'd never sleep with someone who has a quilt like that on their bed. Thus making a huge AH statement. 


- You rightly say someone who feels like that wouldn't be worth sleeping with anyway.


- She decides that you're targeting her and is butt hurt you wouldn't want to sleep with her, even though she already clearly stated she wouldn't want to sleep with you because of a quilt. A quilt y'all. Jesus. 


- Your friend is an ungrateful, insensitive asshole to double down on the quilt knowing how much it means to you. The fact that she's offended that you also don't want to sleep with her because she's shallow af is mind boggling.

peopleofwalmart,ff7986h,t1_ff6xc9k,1579643683.0,"Everyone is different and the differences are what shape their reactions. My neighbor and I were outside across from an abandoned lot when we saw someone in a car try to drop a box of cats/kittens out the window and drive away. 

Unfortunately, two of them bounced out of the box and got caught under a wheel when they were speeding off. One was immediately squashed, the other one had part of it's face taken off, you could literally see its brain hanging out and was flopping around like a fish. She burst into tears, threw up and had a panic attack. I went to go check on the surviving animals. I figured it sucked and people were shitty, but circle of life or whatever. I wound up using my dog's poop bags to clean up the mess. 

The only reason I bring this up is that I completely forgot about it (probably within two days). This incident happened at least a year ago. I ran into her yesterday getting out of a cab and she looked awful. Gaunt, dark circles, red eyes like she'd been crying. I hadn't seen her since she switched apartments not long after the cat incident. 

She said she was coming back from her therapist. After what she saw, she had nightmares for months, crying spells, stopped eating, stopped sleeping. She said she couldn't get floppy cat out of her mind and she was in so much distress still her husband was wanting to put her into an inpatient program for awhile and her doctors were thinking it might be a good idea. She was horrified I had totally forgotten about it and didn't understand how. The point being, we saw the same thing at the same time with vastly different long term reactions. I can't judge her for her brain triggering a cascade of events far different than my own. It was out of both of our control. Comparing does no one any good."
notliketheothergirls,ff75awt,t1_ff719as,1579641410.0,"It means Friday in Arabic.

In this context it's Friday prayer. Friday is the Muslim version of Christian's Sunday and is considered the most significant day of the week. It's also the first day of the weekend. Sunday is actually the first day of the work week here. Anyway. Similarly to Christians, it's when Muslims stop their work and do special preparations for Jummah prayer, often wearing their best clothes. In Muslim countries like mine the government offices, some businesses and academic institutions are closed. Everyone goes to the mosques to offer Jummah, a congregational prayer that Muslims hold each Friday, soon after twelve rather than the Zuhr (one of the five daily prayers). Basically it sounds like she's saying I'm at mosque like I'm supposed to be while you're at home digging on social media, therefore I'm not just better than you, I'm also a better Muslim than you. 

Granted I'm not Muslim, I just live in a Muslim country so maybe someone else can explain it better."

One of my acquaintances is from India, got a job in South Africa with Amazon and after a couple years was able to go to Germany, then Ireland, and he's now in the USA, but he and his partner split, so he's looking at Australia next.  Maybe something like that will work for you?"
