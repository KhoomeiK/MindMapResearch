funny,fgn6p3e,t1_fgmwwf9,1580938731.0,Telling a native person not to bring up politics is like telling a drowning person not to breath. There's no getting around it. Everything in their life is politicized. Even if they don't want it to be. Unfortunately you cant just turn that off. So either they secluded into nothing or make a statement

SubredditDrama,fgn44as,t1_fglz0cw,1580937340.0,It's because the next closest competitor is COD which is way more arcadey.  Maybe saying Battlefront is more realistic is a poor choice of words. But it does take things to a bigger scale and uses broader strategy.  Still to get upset about women being in a game is dumb.

No one told me police officers get free fountain drinks. So the chief of police came in and kinda gave me a back handed comment about it. That night he pulled me over and gave me a speeding ticket. Even though all the cars around me were going the same speed. Dude ended up arresting his son for possession.

And there's no reason to just take your word on it. I get oral history and think there's truth to it most of the time, but who knows if its exaggerated or misrepresented. So maybe the red head blonde thing is questionable because there is no definite proof.. You're just claiming you know more than the average person so we should trust you. The way you came off as defensive makes me question how valid your claims are. If you're an expert you should be able to find source material to back up your claim.  Unfortunately it's the way you present the information that leaves the impact."
chess,fffb3h3,t1_fff0znx,1579880044.0,"I get that to an extent. But chess isn't physically demanding. In other sports they separate them because they can't compete at the same level as the men. Here it almost comes off as they aren't skilled enough to be in the same tournament. I think women are just as capable in chess to play on the same level as the men. Maybe they could set up a men's champion, a women's champion, and then a world champion where anyone can take the title regardless of gender."
