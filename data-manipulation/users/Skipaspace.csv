UnresolvedMysteries,ff5ru7d,t1_ff5jnxc,1579607805.0,I wouldn't say disproportionately affects the innocent. Yes there are plenty of innocent people on death row but it's not an overwhelming statistic. It disproportionately affects people with lower incomes.
aww,fez6myi,t3_equ2n0,1579454339.0,That poor cat.
Catswithjobs,fe2sg41,t3_enkuxz,1578842387.0,There are 2 cats there. Looks like someone has some competition.
MadeMeSmile,fe2s253,t1_fe00y7q,1578842271.0,Whatever breed you get PLEASE rescue. There are rescues for everything type of breed. I can't stress enough please at least look at rescues and shelters.

So no matter you beliefs they really are always with you."

cats,fd43bq2,t3_ejx3j5,1578164006.0,Is the dogs nose ok? It looks a little sore. I know the nose is pink but it looks like the dog might have hit it on something.
aww,fcty3sa,t3_eiqtcu,1577965327.0,I had an old cat that wondered off and my other cat went off to find them outside. And he found her! She came back following him. She died shortly after that. But I'll never forget that. Animals do get attached and care for one another.
cats,fcn41t4,t1_fcmvrak,1577802681.0,I worked at a kennel this happens all the time. People mess up meds. People are overworked. Understaffed and tired. Sue them. This is ridiculous. This seems like carelessness on their part.
cats,fa7703b,t3_e7qm5e,1575832028.0,"Hey there. 

I hope you are doing ok. When I had to put my cat down almost 5 years ago, she purred too. And your post reminded me of that and how heartbroken I was when it happened. I hope you remember the good memories. And take care, I know your pain has to be immense right now."
