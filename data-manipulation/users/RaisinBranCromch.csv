DeadBedrooms,ff3sunr,t1_ff3dxpj,1579548110.0,"Hey, thanks so much for the thoughtful comment, it's the best I've had when making these sort of posts. I knew he liked to be in control in these ways and can be manipulative. I don't know if he realizes what he's doing when he does it, there is something to be said for a learned survival behavior from childhood. It isn't as bad as it use to be, mostly because I called him out and instead of tucking tail and running off to find another victim, he went to counselling with me. So that was a good sign to me.

But you did give me something to mull over. I may not realize how much control he's still trying to maintain and I often do feel like my sexuality is being controlled. So, I'll actually start paying attention a little more again. 

I made a comment about why I stayed after he cheated. Long story short, we married too quickly and far too young. We both felt immense pressure and were freshly coming out of abusive childhoods. I probably would have emotionally cheated which would be a far worse result than a physical fling or two. He never had like a girlfriend to ""obsess over"". Anyway, the problem got confronted, taken to counselling and is no longer a problem. I have access to all his accounts and see him every day for several hours. He's not cheating and probably doesn't even remember the name of the girl."

But you are correct, he is being very selfish and honestly childish. We've had roommate our whole marriage and it's never bothered us. Actually, I might even say that he seems to somehow be *more* into sex and more ""active"" when there's another man around or the roomie and I have been spending more time together. So idk.. maybe it would help."
DeadBedrooms,ff3q1gr,t1_ff2l207,1579546388.0,"I didn't want to make an even longer post explaining why I tolerated the infidelity. 

We only dated for 4 months before he proposed (we both talked about marriage beforehand). I don't regret marrying him at all and after 3 years, it isn't like I married a stranger. He's every bit the person I fell in love with then, just more mature now.

And that was the thing of it. We married at 21, after only 4 months. We both had terrible childhoods and examples of marriage. The dude was scared and extremely insecure, I wasn't making anything easier with my severe anxiety. 

He's no longer interested in other women, hasn't been even before his low libido. The ""new pussy"" remark really was that he was terrified of the commitment he'd just made to me a he'd barely just started dating women when we met and I was his first girlfriend. Kinda insane to expect lifelong monogamy from a kid like that. My moral code just happens to be wired a little differently.

And I also actually would have just been fine with polyamory had he not fucked up all chances at that but lying and showing gross irresponsibility."
