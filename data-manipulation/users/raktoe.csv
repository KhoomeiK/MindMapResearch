baseball,ff70zpv,t1_ff5w43o,1579638960.0,Leafs fans annoy me as a caps fan from Toronto. Just felt like a bunch of people who never cared about NHL until the leafs started winning a bit recently.
NHLHUT,ff6k2oa,t3_ero2zl,1579628879.0,I’ve always wanted to see an improvement to the chip/dump and chase mechanics. Like one on one chopping it to the corner and trying to get around the d-man while they try to stay in front of you would add a new element to the rush. Also forcing players to try to cut off the dump in with a goalie.
Torontobluejays,ff5udme,t1_ff5dc3b,1579610573.0,"He’s likely to opt out in Colorado because they pissed him off. It would still be a risk for him to opt out of that contract, especially if he likes playing where he is."
Torontobluejays,ff524m7,t1_ff4zg6i,1579578164.0,"This would never be accepted obviously, but considering the salary commitment he already carries, I don’t know I’d be willing to go a ton higher."

I think the biggest issue with the punishments was it was tough to judge how guilty each player was, and there was not really a precedent for this. That’s my guess anyway."

Also it was in an emergency situation that Palpatine put him in the suit, so it may be the bare minimum, but he definitely wasn’t intentionally going cheaper in that situation.

In general, the advantage is that if you somehow accidentally put a ball in you don’t end up hooked because you were playing a safety. It’s also just a way so you’re opponent knows you meant to do it."
modernwarfare,fdp8cve,t1_fdp7608,1578622383.0,Well this has been a fun conversation with you. It took me way too long to realize you didn’t actually have anything to say.
modernwarfare,fdp73ei,t1_fdp5tl9,1578621533.0,"What the fuck are you even saying? I’ve read over your first sentence like 5 times and I’m not sure I understand. Do you think they didn’t pay that amount, because they most certainly did. Do you honestly think comp players are garbage because they play without certain equipment? They ban it because it’d be boring as hell to watch, and it creates cheap ways to watch lanes or hold off a choke point. It’s designed around the players being in control of everything that happens, not some claymore watching a hallway for free. And again, I don’t understand what you are saying in the last sentence."
modernwarfare,fdp4v1a,t1_fdp3rx9,1578620039.0,"“Vast majority” ok. If you don’t like the complaining, don’t read it, there’s no need to call someone a crybaby for expressing there thoughts on what make the game less fun to play. If IW would ever release league play I’d gladly play that, because it eliminates all the bullshit. But IW clearly doesn’t give a shit about comp despite the 300 million paid to activision by the franchises under the assumption activision would help grow the league, not make it less visible."
modernwarfare,fdp3o8a,t1_fdodr4l,1578619244.0,"It’s so pathetic that any criticism is met with comments like these. For a lot of us, the game would be a lot more fun with gas grenades gone. They’re not op, but they are extremely annoying and it’s a video game that’s supposed to be fun. Same with claymores, c4 all that. There is far too much equipment in cod now, and it’s as annoying as specialists imo."

hockey,fdlzmf7,t1_fdlz21s,1578536299.0,"I don’t think he recognized that there was a line change going on there. I haven’t seen a replay of it, but I think that’s actually on him."
hockey,fdkh20i,t1_fdkgkpe,1578503718.0,"Absolutely, but I’d rather it be his choice to take a break. For all we know that game could be a difference maker in a 49 vs 50 goal season, which isn’t a huge deal, but would certainly be nice for him to get. It’s also so rare to watch a game without him, it feels weird."
hockey,fdk8dzl,t1_fditq96,1578498414.0,"Fuck that timeout. I was legitimately annoyed when I saw he was voted in this year, knowing it meant getting to see him play less games this year instead of more."
hockey,fdk4l98,t1_fdjc3lo,1578495910.0,"I enjoyed it the first year the format came out. 3 on 3 OT was new that year as well iirc so it was cool to watch more of it. However, in large doses, with no stakes to the games it becomes incredibly boring. The biggest issue though is the intensity of the game just will never be there, and that’s what makes hockey fun to watch. It’s obvious players aren’t trying, and I wouldn’t expect them too. In general ASGs aren’t as exciting as they used to be, because how easy it is to watch players that interest you now. In the past it may have been my only opportunity to watch someone like McDavid play, and that gave a reason to watch. I wish they would just do the skills competition, and have a vote for the best in each category, so you get guys like Weber and chara in hardest shot, etc. Make it a one day event, with more skills challenges so we get to see more player personalities and stuff, and players are more interested in coming for one day instead of two. Also a chance to win an actual competition vs a meaningless game may make players more interested."
hockey,fdk2xgr,t1_fdj1zqz,1578494757.0,"I disagree that Wilson doesn’t have a good hockey iq. I’m not saying he’s super smart, and he has absolutely made some bonehead hits and I hope that’s behind him. With that said he plays well in both zones and is a strong PK option for the caps. I’d say his hockey iq is average to above average at least."
Torontobluejays,fdj3xfl,t1_fdit7pd,1578457784.0,"For the ball, yeah I’d never go sharpie, didn’t mean to make my comment read like that. It’s unfortunate that 15 years ago when my dad first started collecting autographs he didn’t use the official balls for a couple, so Robin Roberts is on a non official ball. One of his bigger regrets for sure, but we also have him on a picture, so it’s not a big deal. Learned about blue ink the hard way too, probably only got 10-15 signatures in black, but they really fade."
Torontobluejays,fdinj6a,t3_elk1ml,1578446872.0,"As others have pointed out, if you’re doing baseballs, spend the extra for official balls. They’re expensive, but really are the best option. Pictures I would use a blue sharpie (black depending on colour) because it will usually look better and pop a little more. Now that I’m writing it out, blue pen and blue sharpie are generally always the best options. Make sure to specify where you want the signature as well."
hockey,fdimkjx,t1_fdilx8u,1578446256.0,"We had a similar game 5 experience when the Caps blew the 3-1 lead against the Rags in 2015. Terrible goalie interference call on what would have been the gwg. They called it on the ice so no review, and Rags win in OT and don’t lose again."

Anyway, my roommate has the HDMI converter, but he’s not living here rn. Anyway, I get I’m whining about a pretty minor inconvenience, but it’s just another frustration in a long day."
hockey,fdihuyy,t1_fdihaf9,1578443262.0,"I know about that. I’ve used it a ton. I paid for nhl live so I can watch games on my TV and it’s frustrating when I can’t despite how much it costs. There were things I wanted to do on my laptop tonight while I watched. I get it’s a small inconvenience, but NHL Live should not cost as much for what it is, and just takes advantage of out of market fans."
hockey,fdih4be,t1_fdigp6n,1578442784.0,"I don’t have a lot of options. I don’t have cable, and even if I did I wouldn’t get the caps games in Ottawa."

No, I have to pirate it on my laptop despite paying $200 to watch the games. Why is MLB TV a cheaper better service with no black outs? NHL live sucks."

I just got in the habit of using it a lot on d to d passes or cycling in the zone because it looked cool, I doubt it ever offered me an advantage. It’s been really throwing me off when I win a face off and sometimes my guy won’t back up, or there’s a kind of pivot I used to use and I can’t now.
