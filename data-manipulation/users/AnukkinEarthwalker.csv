CFB,ff6st28,t1_ff63coc,1579634147.0,Dude had a year playing wr.. a year he rushed for over a 1000 yards.. a year he kicked all kickoffs through endzone and a year passing for over 3000.. not sure which of all these overlap but was just reading a story about him and all this stood out more than his 40 time to me lol
CFB,ff4m38c,t3_erewdi,1579566913.0,"Just thinking off the top of my head.. seems like Dallas during its dominant run ..had some u players..that were also in miami for another of their dominant runs and then the same thing again in Baltimore with ed Reed and ray lewis.
Cant remember if they wont chip at the u off the top of my head but those two nfl teams with that one college were first to come to mind with topic of thread."
nba,ff4ljiw,t1_ff3wxue,1579566535.0,"Not a lawyer but am also from Georgia.

Not trying to say I know more about law than you either.

But one would have to think if he is seeking a bunch of money even tho he is an nba player that his future maybe indeed jeopardized?  
I honestly hadn't heard anything about this till I saw it on espn ""bottom line"" and found it odd no one talked about it on any shows not even the jump..so I was like wt is going on here. So you're probably right ..still wonder tho."
MaddenUltimateTeam,ff4l0iv,t3_erhdip,1579566169.0,Pursuit is one of the most important stats in certain positions.. especially combined with high play recognition guys.
MaddenUltimateTeam,ff4ksk1,t3_er2qkf,1579566016.0,"Love bully rb.. tho I haven't tried any d.henry cards... the chubb totw is extremely underrated even tho it's only 90 ovr. Not only does he run over people but he has speed to gash mfers.
Cards not very expensive either.
Assume Henry is similar but I run a Falcons / played college or in Georgia at some point theme.
Have emmitt power up thats at 94 or 95 ovr I think.. and chubb is just more fun especially on draws and inside zones..dude has crazy vision and I can make him do the same shit he done in college..either run dudes over or run by them."
MaddenUltimateTeam,ff4k032,t3_erijhn,1579565462.0,"It's not impossible to stop outside runs..and if you counter their blitzes with draws or quick passes they would have to eventually change what they do..

I've had ppl msg me crying that I run the same plays..just cause I run no huddle but I rarely ever run the same play twice in a row..tho if you cant slow me down you will see the same set till I score. But I adjust assignments at the line on every offensive and defensive play based on what's in front of me. Shrugs."
MaddenUltimateTeam,ff4jk2w,t3_eriwdy,1579565173.0,"The defense I run is heavily based on having as many safeties on the field as possible..rn ed reed... polamalu..dawkins..and honey badger are on field most the time.. have never thought about chasing this card bcuz idk oop players just dont do it for me but he is one of my fav players of all time and would fit my scheme of players who either played for the falcons or went to college in the state.. also have some guys played high school ball here too but.. have never even checked how much the card goes for..will look into it later..

About 96% of the players I use on field are power ups tho and only times I've dropped ton of coins on cards like that is when the lvl up requires it.

Be surprised how well using safeties work but.. gotta have an agile quick dline..rn normally have lt Khalil and John randall. And good coverage lbs..use tuggle and shazier.. corners have to be shutdown too.. got primetime and champ bailey. Big nickel and other sets arent as op as last year but if you get creative with assignments at the line you can restore some of its previous glory."
AskReddit,ff4hhx2,t3_erhu3x,1579563735.0,"Yea..have had quite a few tbh.. and some I wanted to wake up from and couldn't as well..I came sometimes get lucid and tell that I'm dreaming..
Think that was the case in the one I'll mention.
Basically created an entire planet in my dream from scratch.. started with mountains and oceans.. then animals..which to my memory were primarily the same with some small differences..
Woke up right after starting civilizations with crazy buildings and architecture..
Reminded me of wakanda or Atlantis in aquaman.. 

Was pretty crazy..wanted to continue..wished to go back.. has not happened so far..
Used to have a close friend (female I'm male ..not that it really matters)  but we talked a lot about dreams we had before and she described a similar place I had seen in my dreams.. she was all into lucid dreaming and stuff like that..while I've read up on it..I've never tried to make it intentionally happened just does sometimes..sometimes cool sometimes frightening..anyways she wanted me to meet her at said place..claimed she could dream about it whenever she wanted but I really cant..
Was like 7 or 8 years ago.. changes in work and medications.. i dont dream as much as i used to..
Basically from what i gather lucidity is best achieved when you skip rem sleep.. but double edged sword as it can also cause things like night terrors and sleep paralysis.. which has happened to me a few times..also happens for some reason more when you sleep on your back..at least to me idk y.

Remember the first time it happened I fell asleep at an old ex gf house on a futon in her room.. as I entered dream everything was same as it was when I was awake..

Except I looked down and it looked like my stomach had been slashed with a hattori hanzo sword as soon as my hand touched my stomach I saw blood and my insides and sat up and yelled ..lol was pretty creepy."
technology,ff42fvr,t3_erd274,1579554080.0,"What about movies..or music..or books..or the internet..where you can literally learn and see an unlimited # of things that will scar your soul..

This is bullshit.. but doesn't surprise me that he is the person saying it..

Again.. Democrats approach to things like censorship,privacy as far as technology is concerned is what made me become and independent.. that and the fact that all politicians regardless have their own agendas to push and it always ends up the lesser of two evils and I'm sick of it.
 Entire two party system was developed as an early divide and conquer tactic and is doing its job more so now than ever thanks to social media.
 Some may say that sounds a bit hypocritical but I dont think things would be as bad as they are if not for the constant left and right polarization of everything imaginable. 
 We really really need a drastic restructuring..and people need to realize that politicians are OUR EMPLOYEES and should WORK FOR US. Not for corporations or lobbyists or their own agendas. They should be able to be TERMINATED by us when the crime fits the bill. When they aren't doing their jobs right. These people are supposed to be public servants..not idolized and worshipped. Its bullshit and I'm sick of it."

I'm a falcons fan and a uga fan bro..I've been through the worst.. but I still watch the championship games.

Edit: idk ..maybe watching sec football all my life you always see players you seen grow into something else so there is always at least one player you say u wouldn't mind seeing succeed.

Or maybe I just love good football beyond my own teams more than most."
nfl,ff1q3bd,t1_ff1pw21,1579483675.0,"Yea plus the commerical and all that shit. But it is what it is.

I'm taking the chiefs. Regardless of the outcome.
Andy reid is the best coach left. And mahomes is best overall player left."
nfl,ff1pnpn,t1_ff1pix8,1579483390.0,"Uh. Titans and green bay would have been worse. Titans niners is worse case scenario tho. But probably would be the game we deserve.

Edit: remember when rex Grossman took the bears or rather the bears took him. Would have been bout the same.  But manning was there for that at least."

I am a Falcons fan. Trust me. I know when its over.

SB 28-3 lead stil wouldn't let myself drink cause I knew I would have torn stuff up if they lost..and they did.. so I drank myself to sleep after the l set in lol"

nfl,ff1ngwl,t3_er41w0,1579482102.0,Rodgers beard will be totally gray by end of game.
television,ff1n10k,t1_ff1b1zh,1579481886.0,Yea.. all signs point to one coming tbh.
gaming,ff1mtx6,t3_er2z1h,1579481786.0,Tesla would be op..obviously
nfl,ff1madf,t1_ff1lazm,1579481528.0,"Yea ..

I didn't think about the bears.. really talented team.. brady and maybe draft a good rb and that team is lethal..

Chargers are where he could go if he really wanted to prove a point..
And phillip rivers moving his family to florida instead of l.a. hints they might be going somewhere else... their defense isnt as good as the bears but..idk 

Idk about the colts either.. I think that would be too risky.. possibly take more than just 1 year.. same with the bears.. 

Any other team with all the injuries and lack of talent at wr te and elsewhere would have been a lot worse than the Patriots  tbh. Belichick is a master of turning dirt to gold..

Which again is the reason why I think  Brady is considering playing elsewhere but we will see.

Maybe the guy hasnt played with legit weapons in awhile and he misses it? Gronkowski banged up aged out.. the last time he passed to a household name was moss ffs.

I thought sanu would do a lot better there..he was decent in atlanta and Cincinnati but couldn't get shit going with Brady. 

Michel is also a good rb ..I just think their line isnt that grand either."
nfl,ff1l697,t1_ff1kqjr,1579480963.0,"If I was him.. I would either go to Tennessee where it's a good team and similar system or stay with the pats.

I think he will probably see if there is a team better than the Pats that makes him offer..which again. Tennessee is really the only place I can think of where it works."
nfl,ff1ko9h,t1_ff1kkvs,1579480731.0,I think he goes to Tennessee if anywhere
nfl,ff1kcj0,t3_er41w0,1579480577.0,"As a falcons fan how good the niners are is frustrating af...cause the falcons with Shanahan had a more talented offense.

But the niners have the defense to match.

They should have fires Quinn. Sick of mediocre bs.. dude spose to be a defensive wizard and they havent fielded a lock down defense in his tenure. The sb team defense was better than average but look at the sb obviously not good enough.
If the asshole would have just fed freeman or coleman tho..smh"
nfl,ff1jvp3,t1_ff1fihn,1579480355.0,"I see your point and all but it's still different systems.. 

And if Brady really is the goat then he also would be able to go wherever he wants..

Let's say he goes to Tennessee. The team that knocked them out.. tannehil had a season but he sure is shit ain't brady and they are obviously done with Mariota ..unless they want to use him like the saints do hill..which as their  team is extremely old school in its play style I doubt that. 

Also it's pretty much the Patriots system there already. Honestly that would be an interesting narrative where he could have success and defeat his coach hanging over his head.. literally and physically beat them."
nfl,ff1j7jk,t1_ff0wrl4,1579480063.0,"Because what if he goes and sucks? 

Quite a few ppl, self included can't help but wonder that when they say he is the goat and all...manning ..farve..Montana all had success with two different coaches..

So if he goes and stinks it up somewhere else you go from a few ppl thinking that to many..from goat to moat..

You know hes gotta be considering this to even make it public he is hearing out offers"
nfl,ff0mckb,t3_eqxcud,1579470233.0,"Manning ..montana..Favre all did it.. 

Imo he has still has to prove he is not a system qb.. and that any other qb could have been plugged into same system and  done the same.

So I doubt he will.. cause what happens if he goes somewhere else and is trash."
nfl,ff0jda2,t3_er1075,1579469445.0,Possibly worst tackling I've seen since..idk terrible tho
videos,ff0bpo7,t1_fez9gxp,1579467335.0,"Lol..I typed backpage meant frontpage ..

Any old machine with frontpage extensions active unpatched on it ..I think you can still do the cheap exploit.. you would have to create a virtual existence of nt or win98 ..but if you have the ips you could try those ips..

Most of them probably compromised beyond that at this point and totally controlled as part of botnets tho."

videos,fewd7he,t1_fev9end,1579408662.0,"There was something very similar to netbus and back orifice that allowed you to take over mose control too tho I cant remember the name.
Many of those exe remote exploits infected the person on the other end aswell if they were skidz..plus the fact they got patched so quick. 
All that was prime online experience imo tho.. and though as other have said it seemed like comedy and chaos ..there was alot of learning and building going on too...

Shit was indeed crazy. Knew 2 kids that hacked nasa.gov in 2 different decades...saw kids knock cia.gov offline too with massive ddos.. 

Remember also entering into the 2000s so many windows nt servers being vulnerable to the frontpage exploit.
There were thousands of websites at one point that all you had to do was copy paste drag drop a folder..and you could edit the entire site....

everyone then wanted the glory of having their alias with most defaces on attrition.org and other sites that hosted hacks like that. 

Put my alias at the time up there quite a few times.. never did anything malicious and always left notes for admin on how to patch their shit.

If your irced in the early days of the internet you saw the rise of memes and the like for sure..but the main thing I knew was coming was bots and botnets..once only used for ddos..knew shit would get ugly when they started pushing agendas and ideas instead of packets.
