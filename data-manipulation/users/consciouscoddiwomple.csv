travel,ffcovht,t3_ess4oz,1579804057.0,"I’m an American, who lived in South America for a year+ and spent 5 years living and traveling around South East Asia. 

I understand the feeling of frustration when you come back to the US.

In the 5 years I spent in SEA, I started off loving everything but came to see things that frustrated me. 

I came back to the states last year and I now see how the things I appreciated and the things that frustrated me (about all the countries) just showed me who I am as a person. 

If you hate how loud Americans are, perhaps you enjoy a more peaceful, calm environment. If you enjoyed how open minded how other tourists were, perhaps you appreciate people that are open to new opportunities.

I encourage you to tell all your American friends how amazing your trip was so you can inspire them to see more of the world too. :)"
JapanTravel,ffa24o4,t1_ff9faih,1579726361.0,"Agree with the JR rail pass option, it would probably be faster and more comfortable. Although I’m not sure what the price comparison would be to buses. You can look up JR rail pass and purchase at a travel agency. Before you go to Japan.

Everything you guys have planned look great! There’s a lot of stuff going on so I won’t add to it. Enjoy!"
JapanTravel,ffa19uf,t1_ff9wg6h,1579725863.0,"I agree with both of these points. 

The humidity in Japan is a KILLER in the summer. It depends on where you plan to visit in Japan but Tokyo is already extremely crowded as it is so with the population density + olympics, be prepared. Most malls and cafes in Japan also don’t blast the AC on so expect to be hot even while indoors in public areas. 

Thankfully vending machines are literally everywhere in Japan but heat strokes can be a serious concern so stay hydrated! 

With all that said, there are plenty of less touristy but beautiful places in Japan to visit so I do encourage you to visit if you’re okay with the heat + crowd :)"

digitalnomad,ff7g1xq,t3_erv44e,1579648719.0,"If you are looking for the most convenient place to fly out of, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are probably the best options.

These two will most definitely have direct flights to most cities around South East Asia. They won’t be the cheapest options to rent in SEA standards but it will probably save you some time just because they are major cities.

With that said, if convenience is not much a priority and you prefer cheaper but nice options for where to stay, my favorites were: Hanoi (Vietnam) and Luang Prabang (Laos)."
