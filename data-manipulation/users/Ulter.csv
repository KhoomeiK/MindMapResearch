Begin by visualising a time you'd like to finish, like literally picture a clock set to the time you'd like to end. Initially, just go for five minutes.

Then, either sitting or laying down (if you fall asleep easily then sit), start by inhaling slowly through your nose for a slow count of three ... i.e. one ... pause ... two  ... pause ... three ... pause.

Then exhale slowly through your nose, counting down this time: three ... pause ... two  ... pause ... one ... pause.
Keep going. You'll like stop when your inner alarm hits the time you set for yourself.

Meditation helps with anxiety and ensures there's enough oxygen in your brain to cope.

What if their mother died the night before and you've been on one whole date? It would be nice to say, ""Oh hey, my mum just died, could I get a rain check on that."" Lots of people would do that, but if they didn't, well, ok. I get that too. I would hesitate before revealing that crisis to someone I didn't know very well. I may be busy planning a funeral. I may have locked myself in my room and may not come out for a week.

It may simply be that in that moment, you weren't on their mind at all. You weren't a priority. And that would be ok too. They've got more important things to think about than that random they went on one date with. Sure, maybe they *owe* you something (they really don't), and maybe it's the *honourable* thing to do (is it though?), but also, they may simply not want to deal with any of that until their heart stops breaking.

It's complex. It's not as simple as that. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't, it's best to get on with your life instead of inflicting your poorly informed belief system on someone you really don't know.

If you'd been dating for 3 months and they simply disappeared, that's another situation entirely and another set of rules and soon enough, it's just easier to acknowledge that life isn't full of easy answers, see a therapist, and get on with it. No one ever really knows what's going on for other people, it's not cool to believe the worst of people just because you don't understand it."

askgaybros,fdpma8z,t1_fdpkcrt,1578632641.0,"Ghosting looks identical to cutting-off from the perspective of the person being ghosted, or cut-off.

My point is that not everyone, or even most, people take rejection well. There's not a hard and fast rule you can apply to everyone. 

Some people will hear a ""sorry, I am not interested"" and follow you down the block crying and shouting or calling drunk at 3am. Some people will immediately move to stalking. Others will literally try to restrain you so that they can keep you in their lives. Spend some time at a crisis center and try telling the people there ""Have you tried just telling him that you're not interested? You really owe it to him.""

Not everyone is reasonable. Not everyone handles rejection with a stiff upper lip. Everyone has to make up their own mind, in their own context, how to walk away. Sometimes simply disappearing is completely appropriate.

So why would you blame the victim for cutting ties there? This comment is pretty ignorant and kind of immature. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to simply discontinue the relationship.

If he was really interested in protecting the people, he wouldn't have stopped there. People with actual convictions follow through. Also, you're thinking China. It's China that funds a bunch of terrorist organisations. It's China that also protects Iran. Without the Chinese Veto, the US and UN would have been able to act according to the rule of law.

As for the tarot based system, it's important to remember not just the number of cards available, but the relationships between them. In your example of the lightbringer series, the colours all related to each other as well as being their own thing, with colours like paryl being a master colour, or yellow being the more balanced, while the drafters themselves were most often only able to use colours in a segement of the spectrum like sub-red/red.

The arcana, in particular, tell the story of a journey. A new wizard may hold the rank of Fool and eventually graduate to the rank of World, for example. Perhaps wizards get to the Devil stage and become corrupt, or find their way to the Star and can keep going. They're not individual discrete things, they are stages in a journey. If you were to go the suits option, that's basically just elementalism by another name.

So, my advice, have limitations, be aware that there are often relationships between things and this blows the complexity out considerably."

The paper seems to tie environmental conditions as the primary motivator for co-operative and group based reproduction, which you'd expect in any discussion about evolution. The finding that they couldn't tie, or resolve, the particular environmental conditions leading to co-operative breeding is irrelevant in this discussion.

What confused me about your statements was the singling out, in particular, of homosexual behaviours in that. But go for it, like I said, if that one thing in particular that no-one has measured (for whatever reason, despite an apparently huge volume of behavioural study), then yeah, sure, go nuts. I wasn't aware of how little work had been done ... but I guess I shouldn't be surprised there. There has certainly been an agenda historically in behavioural and social science circles to erase this information and I appreciate that this trend has largely been reversed.

It seems like a pretty big oversight and I mistook your focus on same-sex behaviours for an agenda instead of an attempt to raise awareness of this gap.

While we may all be on the evolution subreddit, there are more than a few different flavours of that. I work in AI, using evolutionary techniques to evolve novel solutions, for example.

My point is that there has been plenty of work done in this regard, in particular, game theory, as one example. Both economics and politics also provide numerous theories and studies about when it's better for agents to co-operate, even at their own individual disadvantage, to ensure the survival of the greater community or gene-line.

These ideas aren't novel or unexplored, they have literally been discussed and studied for centuries already. My issue here is that you seem unaware of this and are demanding we re-do it all to prove that homosexuals, in particular, have some value.

Mammalian mother's regularly produce milk for their children in addition to their own needs. They team up with others to make sure there is that surplus. This is pretty normal, directly observable in your own lived experience and I'm not sure we really need to spend a lot of time exploring this mystery.

If you need half a pie a day to survive and there are three of you, then having one bow out gracefully ensures the survival of two. All three going for it will cause the death of all three.

So what are the direct advantages to homosexuality to a population?

Well, for starters, there is evidence to suggest that the more kids you have, the the greater the chance of the later ones being gay. As a basic form of population control. So there's that one. If you've got a couple of productive siblings then the selfish genes are still being passed on and now they're not in competition with themselves for resources.

As a knock on from that, the gay siblings now provide additional resources for the productive siblings, increasing their chance of survival and, again, the continuance of those familial genes.

So, if you look at it from the selfish gene perspective, you would expect some mechanism to curtail competition with themselves and if that mechanism also conferred a greater survival advantage to those genes already in play, all the better."

We're kind of late-stage evolution at this point, or if you like, the fancy sci-fi version compared to the billions of years ago version which was running on chance. Our DNA has a bunch of mechanisms that evolved to make things a little more sensible, i.e. ways to repair mutations, behaviours similar to parity checking, etc.

But back in the early days, yeah. Pretty random.

To answer your specific point about neutrophils, the answer is, as always, if they didn't do that, then the host organism died, or had diminished oppurtunity to reproduce, and joined the list of nature's greatest failures (also known as the fossil record). 

Organisms that lucked into neutrophils that died at the right time (and all cells have a self-destruct mechanism, the failure of which is called cancer, see apoptosis) lived, so hooray, that's the right answer, you win and suddenly the mutation is everywhere and nobody ever thought it was ever any other way.
