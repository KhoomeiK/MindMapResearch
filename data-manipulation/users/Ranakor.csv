EndlessFrontier,ffjqd71,t1_ffjn7u7,1580004268.0,"I’m sorry just clarifying, i’m talking about the bottom right (i already have all pets for and been using undead meta way before i stopped) where there are 2 versions (one full undead and one with 2 undead swapped with 2 elves) and the arrow connecting them says skill push. 

I’m not talking about the bottom left/bottom middle and orc/bears"
EndlessFrontier,ffjmdgk,t1_ffjl3g2,1580001583.0,"I’m confused by the last bit that says skill push, does this mean there are 2 versions (middle right for fighting, bottom right for skill push) or that you should switch to bottom right once you’re > kl 425? (am over KL 620 returning from a 6 month break)"
WizardsWheel,ffi4n5p,t1_ffhrcit,1579964952.0,You can also purchase it in events (all my winter gear was yellow) i was worried if i got some from an event it would get auto-sold with that checked as it’s legendary (or that they’d have more events when it instead drops from a boss)
