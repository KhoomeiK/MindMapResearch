Pro- or retrograde burns change *average* orbital velocity and distance, but the point of divergence will still be on both orbits because it also changes eccentricity. The period won't change by enough to matter, they would probably still be on a collision course if he wasn't trying to disappear into space, and maybe even if he was, I don't know how much thrust the MMU had. In either case, they'll be closs enough to shake hands in about 90 minutes. And a lateral acceleration would just change the orbit's inclination, which my intuition says will reunite them in half an orbit, but I am told it will also take a full orbit for reasons I haven't taken the time to investigate."
