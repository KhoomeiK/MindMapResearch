AskReddit,ffepmg7,t1_ffd84c1,1579859128.0,Your father's planned this. They were like 'ha what if we made our kids live like each other' over a beer. You just happened to get married.
AskReddit,ffep4wz,t1_ffdvcx0,1579858381.0,One time I was beside the window and went 'look its lightning' as a kid and right there it struck in our front yard. Me and my older sister had to do a double take.

mypartneristrans,ffendkq,t3_et3g19,1579855745.0,"Its completely valid to feel nervous about her transition. She is going through a big change but so are you. I haven't heard anyone who is bi or pan break up because their no longer attracted but I have heard that with straight and gay people. As for her changing overall, they are still your partner. The same person you married and had kids with, they're just going to be a girl now (and probably happier). Anybody who really goes through a big personality change while transitioning isn't because they transitioned. I hope you guys figure this out together and stay together for a long time."
aww,ffemrah,t1_ffe7nmf,1579854846.0,I love them but their noises are kinda terrifying. Especially the when you don't know they make that noise.

NoStupidQuestions,ff55g5o,t3_erdm3s,1579580759.0,"The closer they sleep the more they trust you. Some other signs are tucking in paws, slow blinking, and showing their belly. This is gonna sound kinda weird but I'd actually reccomend slow blinking at your cat. Shows that your content and trust them. Eyes are the only thing every animal has in common that you can see."
