""Mesozoic theropods were also very diverse in terms of skin texture and covering. Feathers or feather-like structures are attested in most lineages of theropods. (See [feathered dinosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur)). However, outside the [coelurosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelurosauria), feathers may have been confined to the young, smaller species, or limited parts of the animal. Many larger theropods had skin covered in small, bumpy scales. In some species, these were interspersed with larger scales with bony cores, or [osteoderms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoderm). This type of skin is best known in the ceratosaur [*Carnotaurus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus), which has been preserved with extensive skin impressions. ""

It's interesting stuff :)"
science,fffta8m,t1_fffp7mh,1579891322.0,You still have to prove feathers.  Not all dinos had them.  Assuming feathers isn't helpful to science.

I watch my best friend and his husband raising the most perfect little girl in the world, and I'm so \*so\* happy that she exists and is perfect and loved and just... her.  But it took \*years\* of conversations before we got there.  It took \*years\* of figuring out if I could be okay with that.

There's still the occasional day where I'm not, even when I know there's nothing I would change.

Her hair is \*her\*.  It's not like she went out of her way to make it a colour that would clash- it's literally who she is.  And if you don't want who she is at your wedding, then i'm glad for her that she doesn't have to go anymore."
