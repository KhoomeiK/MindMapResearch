facepalm,ffh9ltv,t1_ffh3leo,1579927107.0,"Raw almonds make my stomach ache really bad, but it seems like roasted almond or chocolate covered almonds is fine though. I still limit how much I eat though, just in case."
TalesFromRetail,ffgnu4y,t1_ffgasfm,1579910595.0,"I fucking hate that ""scanning code of practice"" bullshit. I also work at the grocery store, with clothing. The clothing company often clearances one or two things without telling us, and we only find out when a customer was buying one. AND fucking customers will fuck with the tag so that it just looks like it was priced wrong (there's A LOT of of items on clearance that are under $10). So I tell them that it doesn't apply to the clothing.

Not to mention the people who just outright steal the clothes. And it's so damn easy to do! Not that the clothes are expensive (they're very reasonably priced). So much money walks out the door, but corporate doesn't seem to care. Like, security tags would help a lot!"

LifeProTips,ffe69ru,t1_ffe4g4e,1579837818.0,"Oh my God that's awful! Have you tried nail glue to seal the crack while it grows out? You can use just nail glue, or you can reinforce it by using a tea bag (get a tea bag, cut open, empty out tea, cut out a strip, use nail glue to stick it on your nail)."
WTF,ffdw5v0,t1_ffda3e9,1579830422.0,Ooh I'd like a Corona in an IV drip. Put the line slice in the bag too.

cats,ffb6t1r,t1_ffa84cm,1579753339.0,"First you should quarantine the new cat. You want to do this just in case the new cat is sick with something contagious, but also, it helps both cats become accustomed to each other's scent in a safe way. Then you can do a gentle introduction. However, at some point, you will have to let them work out on their own who is the top cat. It might involve a fight or two, but they'll figure it out.

My two cats were introduced this way. I wish they'd snuggle, as in OP's pic, but they don't. Bella was here first, along with another cat, Chloe (who was here before Bella), but Penny is definitely The Boss. They do play together though, and Penny feels more secure out in the yard if Bella is out there with her. Get that second kitty!"
