IIRC Webber had a microfracture surgery, which at the time was the kiss of death for players' careers. I think Penny Hardaway had it too, and he fell off a cliff. 

Amare was one of the first to come back from it and not have a major drop in terms of athletic ability and production. 

So Webber's contract had become an albatross (ie a giant nearly unmovable contract, hamstringing an organisation and making it almost impossible to improve the team via trade or free agency).

>November 13, 2013: Former [Japanese Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Prime_Minister) [Hatoyama Yukio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatoyama_Yukio) offered personal apology for Japan's wartime crimes, especially the [Nanking Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre), ""As a Japanese citizen, I feel that it's my duty to apologise for even just one Chinese civilian killed brutally by Japanese soldiers and that such action cannot be excused by saying that it occurred during war.""[\[51\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan#cite_note-51)

""even just one"" makes it seem doubtful that there was even one civilian that was killed by the Japanese. Meanwhile, there are pictures with Japanese soldiers bayonetting babies. 

Japan at best half assed those apologies."

worldnews,fevt532,t1_feum5ic,1579401147.0,"Because the ""war on terror"" was such a success ?

What would the US have done ? Drone attacks in Mexico ?

Cartel members, just like terrorists, are members of those communities, not outside invaders. Without radical change in the society, you kill one, you create 5 more. Especially as an outside force perceived as an invading one. Just declaring them as terrorists and bombing the shit out of them won't work.

Not to mention, there are no Kurds in Mexico for the US to use to fight against the cartels."
nba,fevpbwf,t1_fev8oms,1579399944.0,"Gerald Wallace was selected by the Bobcats in the expansion draft. He was on the Kings, and the Kings didn't protect him (you could protect 8 players).

A REALLY bad move by the Kings, because they had Webber at the time, and he had slowed down because of his injury and was a bad contract they were trying to get rid of.

And yet they protected Webber and left Wallace un protected.

Such a stupid move.

They lost an asset, when they could have kept the asset and maybe gotten rid of a bad contract. Although I don't think the Bobcats would have picked Webber. Nobody wanted his contract at the time, and when the Sixers traded for him it was seen as a prayer/bad move, one last ditch attempt to build something around a declining Iverson."
