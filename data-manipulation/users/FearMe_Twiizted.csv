It’s not that they were more complex, it’s that it was an entire different type of math problem. I did know how to get the answer, I just didn’t know the fast way and it was a timed test.

It is an entrance test that they give plenty of study material and 6 math prep classes for. Each is 3 hours long. They explain ALL types of math that will be on the test.
