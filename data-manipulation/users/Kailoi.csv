rareinsults,ff4qrp1,t1_ff4jtj3,1579570192.0,I see what you did there.
rareinsults,ff4ctzv,t1_ff4c77i,1579560597.0,You have. It when those things strike as you're walking downtown and there is not a bathroom in sight that the tragedy happens.
rareinsults,ff48lpq,t1_ff474g0,1579557911.0,You've clearly never had any kind of colonic disease or been to a foreign country where the food.... Didn't agree with you. ;)
AskReddit,ff1ior3,t1_feymuur,1579479836.0,"You joke. But when I grew up in new Zealand and went to the University of Christchurch. The first year they gave out email addresses to students, 1992ish I think, if you sent an email to a .NZ address it cost you 20 cents and to any .com or international address it cost 50 cents. 

You used to have to physically go into the computer science Dept to top up your account with cash."
pics,feqf03v,t1_fepwvoh,1579341120.0,"Felis domesticus sure. But the cats we domesticated to make them, which are very similar in size, hunting and behaviour are native in lots of places throughout the middle east, North Africa and eastern Europe in their desert cat varieties and in many eastern European forests in their forest cat varieties. 

Cats almost identical to domestic cats are native lots of places where they have territories and predators. They can exist in a balanced ecosystem where they have natural predators. Just not in places like Australia where they don't.

aww,fepflw8,t1_fepbs83,1579319280.0,Exactly. And there are some impossabilties for some people. But I think the original message is you can't nessacerily tell what those are just by looking at them. And that one should give someone a chance or at least check. *shrug*
aww,fepfcsk,t1_fepbth4,1579319101.0,"It was not meant in any kind of smug way at all. I'm sorry it came across like that. No euphmaisms intended or embedded. 

If you read it that way, I apologise."
aww,fepagye,t1_fep61nw,1579315787.0,"Where there's a will there's a way. 

Disabled high speed skiing is an Olympic sport. :) Don't assume things.

aww,fepa43r,t1_fep7orp,1579315554.0,"I think (after having seen many of their videos) what she was trying to say and didn't get across right is that one should not IMMEDIATELY reject someone just becuse they are in wheelchair or have a disability and that one should consider it and read their promo etc. Or you might miss out on something that could have been good just becuse of an anti handicapped bias. 

But the lifestyle issues you mention are totally valid reasons not to. I think she was just poorly trying to say that it should not be ones immediate reaction to discard the disabled by default."
politics,fekdbb8,t1_fekc492,1579197654.0,Upvote for pitch meeting reference. :p
politics,fdiv9tp,t1_fdiubef,1578451820.0,"Dude, if you wanna play the ""nuh uh! They did it first"" game please remember that Iran was a modern, scientific, peaceful, non-religious democracy up until 1953 when the CIA helped overthrow the democratic government and replaced it with a monarch which then directly led to the Islamic revolution of 1979. 

If the US had left them well enough alone they would be a shining beacon of democracy and modernity in the middle east that most likely would have pulled the rest of the region along with them. 

The US just didn't like that they nationalised their oil industry so American companies couldn't profit there. Yep, It's always about oil. 

We totally started it.

australia,fdc6qa0,t1_fdafhfy,1578268191.0,"Oh, they're real firefighters all right. Just not paid ones. I imagine some of these people have seen more catastrophic action in the last 3 months than some ""real"" firefighters do in their entire careers."
TIHI,fcxg3mf,t1_fcxemte,1578062028.0,"You must be fun at parties.


I posted this playfully becuse it's mildly annoying to a funny subreddit for mildly annoying things. You called me out on it and I playfully replied over the top to make it obvious I was being silly. Apparently I needed a /s? 

Chill Winston. ;) It's all fun and games here."
TIHI,fcxel4s,t1_fcxegwo,1578060871.0,"It's an abomination. So many good covers out there. This one for example:

AskReddit,fcik8cy,t3_eh6fpq,1577663949.0,"Recently I was at work and giving a talk on text formatting languages. I wanted to show the room an example of the language ""LaTex"". 

So on the big screen I opened up Google and thought ""just a screenshot of the syntax will do"" so did a quick image search for ""latex"". The second I hit enter my brain went ""oh no""...

Fortunately everyone laughed and now I never hear the end of it. 

Protip: ""latex formatting"" is a safe alterative."
WTF,fc26gtz,t1_fc263h2,1577342572.0,That's the amusing thing. I was mates with the performer. I know what goes into the glass acts. It's just funny that of all the acts she freaked out at that one whereas I was totally chill. :)
