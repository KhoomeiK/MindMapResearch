If idiots want to buy an aggressive breed because it makes them feel like a big swinging dick, my saying that I don't like dogs that were bred for their aggression  isn't going to sway them even further.   


Are the people who claim they're no more dangerous than a Golden Retriever and were actually bred as nanny dogs (a disgusting pro-pit myth made up by a pitbull breeder) also responsible for people letting their babies climb all over their pits for social media photos? Are they responsible for people not exercising the proper caution when it comes to dog-child interactions?

The nanny dog thing is a myth. Even pro-pit organisations debunk this because it's an incredibly dangerous myth invented by a pitbull breeder in the 70s. Nothing in the historical records supports that nonsense, and it encourages idiots to take photos of their babies lying all over their pitbulls.   


There was a problem with rotties and German Shepherds for a while. They became popular, they were overbred by backyard breeders, and were becoming more aggressive as a result. Passionate, responsible breeders admitted that there was a problem, and actively worked to trace back the lineage and isolate which lines were descended from aggressive dogs, and to no longer breed from those lines. Know how many deaths it took before they saw a problem and began working to fix it? Eight. Eight deaths between them.  


There have been two or three pitbull mauling deaths already this month. Who is admitting that there is a problem and trying to breed the instability and aggression out of the breed? No one. Denying the problem doesn't fix it. pretending that aggression isn't in their genes despite hundreds of years of breeding for bull-baiting and dog fighting, but that they've somehow retained ""nanny dog"" genes, despite NEVER having been used or bred for that, is ridiculous."

Anyone breeding any livestock knows that temperament has a genetic factor. It's why when Guide dogs for the blind only trained dogs donated by the public, the dogs only had a 9% pass rate to graduate the programme, but when they began selectively breeding for a more stable temperament (less fear, more confidence) that rate shot up to a 90% pass rate.

Although Cory crimps the hose to pause the flow, I prefer to hold the bucket end of the tube and use my thumb over the end to pause the flow of the syphon; easier and gives you more control.

Now my girl is a good girl, well trained and socialised, so I don't think she'd dream of biting, unless really pushed. But her ears were back, and she was lip licking and desperately trying to avoid eye contact while going whale eyed. I told him to stop of course, and explained how hostile he was acting in dog language, but I was stunned he didn't know this, and didn't see how uncomfortable she was!"
BanPitBulls,fehsv0p,t3_ep4mqi,1579123195.0,"Pitbulls are the only breed (as far as I know) bred exclusively for bloodsports. Dobermans, German Shepherds, Rotties - all had different functions in the past, and even dogs used as guard dogs tend to be defensive protectors of territories, not actively seeking to attack and enjoying mauling. Others with powerful breeds are also the first to warn that a German Shepherd or a Rottie needs an experienced handler, and are honest about the pros and cons of the breed!   


If pitbull owners were honest about their breed, then they have to admit the dogs are physically powerful, dog aggressive, have a high prey drive, have gameness bred into them, are excellent escape artists, and in the worst cases, can and have turned on children and their own owners without provocation. That although many of them will lead long, happy affectionate lives without a problem - that many do not, and that they are poorly bred with no attention to temperament.   


They can't breed them back to some lovely historical standard the way German Shepherd breeders or terrier breeds can. They would have to actively breed away from their historic standards - but that would change the face, shape and nature of the breed so much, that it would no longer be a pitbull. So they're stuck in a quandary. Admit that the breed is a potential danger, or lie through their teeth and pretend it's a nanny dog. Very few will admit that it's a strong, high prey drive dog prone to aggression, so they don't control or manage it the way you would a GSD or Dobie, and more tragedies occur."

But if people want a pitbull and acknowledge that they aren't ""velvet nanny dogs"" and manage them accordingly, I'm fine with that. Like I'm fine with farmers keeping bulls, but wouldn't want them loose in the street.  


It's the lies around pitbulls that make them so incredibly dangerous. ""Sweet loving dogs, mines just 'reactive' to other dogs and small kids!"" ""they're nanny dogs!"" ""it's not the breed! They're just like other dogs!"" great family pets!"" ""he must have been abused!""  


As if a husky is the same as a pug. Or a beagle can be trained to ignore scents and hunt with their eyesight instead. All dog breeds are different and need different handling and environments.

Let them know that temperament is an innate, genetic quality. Responsible breeders of any breed will refuse to breed a dog that us unstable, skittish or aggressive, even if it physically fits the breed standard, because it can pass those nervous or aggressive qualities to the pups. The English and American kennel clubs list temperament in the breed standard "" A Breed Standard is the guideline which describes the ideal characteristics, temperament and appearance including the correct colour of a breed and ensures that the breed is fit for function."" - precisely because the temperament can be predicted and bred into a pedigree line, as it's a heritable trait.   


Lets look at the breed standard for English Springer Spaniels for instance (I'm biased, I admit!) "" Friendly, happy disposition, biddable. Timidity or aggression highly undesirable.""  


Anyone breeding pedigree Springers can expect most of their puppies to turn out with this temperament because it's been bred for over hundreds of years. Sometimes a dog will turn out to be skittish or unusually aggressive, and that dog wont be bred from, because it doesn't fit the standard and would pass on those qualities and eventually, change the breed to something different entirely.   


Take Guide Dogs for the Blind. 70% of the dogs that fail to graduate the programme, fail because of behavioural reasons - namely, fearfulness or lack of confidence, traits which have a high rate of heritability. Quote from the article linked below;  
"" The relatively high heritability of fearfulness indicates that selection against it should be moderately successful, but in this not all breeds are equal. In a study that included four breeds as well as the crosses of these (Labrador retriever, Australin kelpie, boxer, and German shepherd dog), fearfulness was highest in German shepherds and lowest in Labradors, which also showed the greatest response to selection (Goddard & Beilharz 1986).  


From these studies (and many more like them), we can conclude that evaluating behavior in dogs and using that information for selective breeding has proven to be extremely difficult, even in well-managed breeding programs in which the dogs are bred and raised under controlled conditions, receive similar treatment and experiences, and are assessed by trained handlers.  


If we believe in genetics (which of course we do!), we would expect that dogs from selective breeding programs should have low rates of behavior problems, but still 70% of the dogs that fail to complete the program are removed because of behavior. Perhaps a better way to judge whether these specialized breeding programs are successful is to note that in the early days when dogs for guide dog training programs were donated by the public, the success rate was 9%; selective breeding improved the success rate to 90% in just a few generations (Pfaffenberger 1963). It is the remarkable early success of the guide dog breeding programs that provided the convincing evidence that broad differences in behavior among breeds are heritable, and that improvement within breeds is possible.""

Now consider - what qualities and traits were pitbulls bred for? The main three back when the breed as baiting bulls, and for dog fighters are gameness (willingness to hold on and keep fighting to the death, no matter what happens to them) aggression (especially dog aggression) and the lack of warning signals that most dog breeds give. Pitbulls don't posture then escalate the threat level as most dogs do. Most dogs will physically posture, show a whale eye, growl, lift the lip and escalate to a snarl, air-snap, then bite as a last resort. Pitbulls rarely do this. They tend to freeze, fixate on prey, then go straight to full on attack.  
You can see that in this video (graphic content warning) this dog knows this woman. It's loose in the garden with her and her grandchildren. But she squeals, it triggers the dogs prey drive, and in an instant, the dog regards this woman he knows as prey. No warning  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X\_A2nszFPm4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_A2nszFPm4)   


Is anyone out there trying to breed these traits out of pitbulls? Working to change their temperament and make them more reliably friendly? Nope. They're bred specifically for aggression for dog fighters, or bred as XXL bullies by backyard breeders, sold as 'protection dogs'. People are still actively breeding them to be aggressive, to be game, and to regard people and other dogs are prey. Breeding for friendliness isn't what pitbull people want. They want a pitbull, and a pitbull is muscular with a blocky head and a grimace because it was bred to fight. In doing that, we shaped the temperament along with his form."

Don't make shit guarantees about what someone else would think of having one. There are hundreds of breeds of dog I'd love to own, pitbulls aren't even on my list. Bad owners can make for badly trained dogs, yes, but pitbull aggression, gameness, and lack of warning signals before biting are all qualities we bred into them to create bull-baiting then fighting dogs. The very same qualities that make them so dangerous when they attack, and that cannot be trained out of a dog. Poor temperament is a genetic quality, and the backyard breeders churning out pitbulls and bully mixes are most certainly not breeding for an agreeable temperament.  


Speaking of Harvard studies though, how about this one? Do some real research. I would love to hear your response if you can read through this.  


"" The recent scientific study, ""Significant Neuroanatomical Variation Among Domestic Dog Breeds,"" performed and led by a Harvard evolutionary neuroscientist with a team of fellow experts (their purpose was simply to discover if and how selective breeding by humans has influenced/altered the brains of dogs; they did not expect to find such strong correlations and differences), found that the brains of different domestic dog breeds had great variations from other breeds but NOT within breeds; in other words, ""through selective breeding, humans have significantly altered the brains of different lineages of domestic dogs in different ways.""

They further found that in breeds, form does indeed follow function, and that in pit bulls and dogs with the appearance of pit bulls--blocky head, oversized jaws, muscular body, etc.--an MRI is likely to reveal (as it very clearly did in the MRIs they performed) that what they referred to as ""Component 5,"" the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (associated with fight-or-flight responses to fear, stress, and anxiety, and in dogs with aggressive behavior) is *significantly larger* than in other breeds, just as in, say, ""scent hunting dogs,"" their ""Component 2,"" the olfaction and gustation area, is significantly larger than that same component in herding dogs or retrievers.

The study authors note: ""In all six of the regionally covarying networks we found, significant correlations were found with at least one behavioral specialization. Associations between brain networks and related behavioral specializations are apparent. For example, Network 2, which involves regions that support higher-order olfactory processing, shows a significant correlation with scent hunting, while Network 3, which involves regions that support movement, eye movement, and spatial navigation, shows a significant correlation with sight hunting. These findings strongly suggest that humans have altered the brains of different breeds of dogs in different ways through selective breeding.""

It's the argument we've always made about dogs being bred to be suitable for their purpose - sighthounds, scenthounds, herders etc - that we shaped dogs both physically and mentally for the traits we wanted. And if a bloodhounds nose is vastly more sensitive than a spaniels - and the bloodhounds entire face is shaped around the purpose of funneling the scent- *of course* we're also shaping the brain and how it lights up.   


I have yet to see a pit nutter accept that herders herd, greyhounds chase small prey and are shaped to run extremely fast etc, that pitbulls are also influenced by their genetics. Pitbulls are apparently blank slates at birth and only respond to what has been trained into them, the only breed that apparently has no genetic influence or breed traits.

It's extremely ignorant to claim that breeding and genetics has no influence on traits or behaviour. It means you're either a simpleton, or a liar. You know full well that traits bred into pitbulls specifically for bull baiting and dog fighting, namely - to attack without warning, to hold on for grim death, and to ignore any pain and power through until their prey is dead ""gameness"" is exactly what they demonstrate when they attack, and why they are more dangerous than a damn labrador.

I might steal the term 'supermutt'. I have a dog I adopted as a pup, was told Springer, but I was pretty sure there was something else in there too. Was hard to tell as she hadn't been wormed as a pup and was a bit stunted, but she wasn't as chonky as Springer pups usually are, and her head shape was slightly off for a Springer. I didn't care though, loved her whatever. She caught up on her growth quickly once wormed and on a good diet, and we'd always try to guess what else she was mixed with. Terrier maybe? Whippet? Border Collie? Could have been any of them. Her feathering wasn't coming through the way Springers feathers usually do, her coat was more like a smooth collies when she was young, but with a tufty bristle at the end of her tail that suggested she might get more as she matured.  


As she reached two, her feathering came through properly, but strangely long on her sides, and she got her long white plume of a feathered tail. But not double coated like a Springer.

The guppy is much more likely to struggle against the flow than an algae eater (what kind?) because of those big flowing fins. Guppies aren't the strongest swimmers, but even more so when they have big flowing fins. Makes it hard for them to fight the current. They also tend to prefer to swim at the top and middle sections of a tank, but will go to the bottom to pick at food and things."

If so, they're colourfast. I went for broke and soaked a large piece that had been stored for 20 years and had stains on it in warm water and fabric stain remover, and it came up gleaming, no problem with the thread colours. But all the threads were DMC, and I was preparing myself to potentially lose the piece.  


If it's just standard grubbiness, a warm water bath with a little dawn dishsoap is fine! Rinse well with clean water after washing, take a clean, white towel, and roll the piece gently in the towel. Then can iron it on a cool setting to finish."

BanPitBulls,fdrl4jr,t1_fdri3jf,1578686086.0,"You're welcome! I think you'll see a noticeable difference if you incorporate more mental challenges into your dogs day to day life. Think about what a shepherd dog had to do, especially working with animals as large and sometimes stubborn as cattle. Yes, they worked with a handler, but they had to be able to independently decide how to approach the animals, when to back off, when to nip a heel to move a stubborn cow.. these are smart dogs with busy little brains!  


Even simple tasks can make them think, help them feel like they have a job, and help them feel calmer. It took weeks to teach my dog names for all of her toys, and days to teach her how to drop a toy into a box. Once she had those down, she learned ""put your toys away"" was a job I gave her every night. It's fun for you both. Google ""brain games for dogs"" and you can find endless cheap ideas."

 What do you think about the pro-pit bull bias on some of the other ""wholesome"" subs? The kind where people share photos of their new puppies. I've noticed recently that if anyone shares a photo of their new Golden Retriever or other pedigree dog, there are inevitable ""adopt, don't shop"" comments, and often people accusing them of buying them from puppy mills or backyard breeders. Or asking about spay/neuter. These comments seem to be allowed and accepted! Yet if someone shares a photo of a brand new pitbull puppy, as someone did today... nothing. No one questions if people are buying yet more backyard bred 'pibbles', when those are the dogs that the shelters are overflowing with.  


Shelters are not rammed to the gills with Golden Retrievers. No one is health or temperament testing pitbulls before breeding them, and the pitbull lobby talks about it being about the owner, responsible owners, not supporting backyard breeding, spay and neuter etc - yet the one breed that is filling shelters to the brim? No one questions the source or accuses them of being awful people."

BanPitBulls,fdq3ep4,t1_fdpk0dr,1578652930.0,"As someone with smart/high energy breeds (Border Collie x Springer spaniel) I can give you some tips - work smarter, not harder.  


You're never going to physically wear out your dog. Physical exercise is still an important part, yes, but more and more physical exercise isn't the solution. Dogs like  ours were bred to work for eight hours or more outside and keep going. Your dog just gets fitter and fitter, and will always be able to outpace you.  


The trick is to combine physical and mental exercise. Physical exercise isn't enough if they aren't working their brain, and mental exercise is fulfilling and tiring at the same time. For mine, this means we do nosework, agility, and obedience training, along with puzzle toys and shaping behaviours where she has to think and offer new behaviours to get rewards.   


Combine the exercise with anything that requires your dog to use his brain and challenges him mentally, and he will be a much happier (and more tired!) dog."
