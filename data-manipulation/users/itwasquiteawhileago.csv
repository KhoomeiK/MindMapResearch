I have a feeling her building has dead spots and it probably struggles to connect to signal sometimes, causing it to randomly disconnect from RCS. She says it's always on 4G, but something has to be up. She's using a Nokia 6.1. I work from home on WiFi all day and I never disconnect on my Moto G5+. 

I've seen others report similar random disconnects. Without being at my wife's work, I can't really say if anything is going on or not. I only have her word, so there's no real in-depth trouble shooting going on there. But based on it seemingly only happening when she's at work, I have to think there's some signal based something going on (she never connects to WiFi at work, always on AT&T towers)."

The way to look at it is, the SOC arm is your baseline to compare. If people fail that treatment, the IP becomes an option because, frankly, there likely isn't much else to try at that point. It's more a last effort to see if things can turn around than a ""carrot"" to incentivize the patients to stay in SOC. They'd be getting SOC anyway, if they weren't in the trial (SOC would vary from patient to patient somewhat, given the customized nature of oncology treatments, but it'd still be an ongoing conversation with the treating oncologist and patient as to what is best option).

I knew they weren't really hearing me, but I kept getting the same answer, so I just rolled with it, figuring they couldn't all be wrong. Then, one night, everything tipped, I went to the ER, was sort of misdiagnosed again (the meds I was given made things worse), and followed up with my actual PCP for the first time in years. Boom, diagnosis. Boom, resolution. Back to normal in a month or so with some PT.

Looking back, I should have insisted that what the PAs were saying didn't make sense. The symptoms were similar, but not happening at the times you would expect. Once the diagnosis was made, everything made total sense and I kicked myself for not pushing harder, or trying to explain it better.

You learn a lot, but one thing I'm still trying to learn is what is okay for me to let a pro do, to save time and to make sure it's done right. All these home improvement commercials make it seem like anyone can do anything. Nope. Sometimes it's best to let a pro do it. I still feel like a failure when I need a plumber or something to check things out. Oh well."
Android,fe7j8lt,t1_fe7i0st,1578915310.0,"You're missing the point entirely. Making the battery easier to remove and replace means more people will do that. The more barriers to this, the less likely it is to happen. And you're leaping to conclusions. ""Throwing away"" means getting rid of it in this context, and includes recycling. But recycling is a last resort. 

Reduce is what we should aim for, and simple, user replaceable batteries are a step to help reduce the number of phones people toss/recycle. Lots of people can't be arsed to take it somewhere to replace the battery, or they don't possess the skills/tools to do it themselves on a sealed phone. Don't be pedantic."
technology,fe7hov0,t1_fe72cz5,1578914627.0,"The ""gig economy"" on a small scale is awesome. They called it a ""side hustle"" in some ads, which is what it should be: something you do to earn a bit of extra cash, when and where you want, with maximum flexibility. What it has become, though, is a full time job for many, and a necessity for others to supplement low income from a primary job. This creates an environment where people race for scraps. And because people are desperate for those scraps, it just gets worse.

Once the primary and secondary jobs are automated for so many people, shit is gonna get real. I feel we're only at the top of this thing. Wait until there are even more people competing for even fewer jobs. I don't necessarily have a solution for this, but I do know we can't keep doing it the way we are."

Android,fe4slse,t1_fe4clok,1578862363.0,"Yes, so much this. We live in a disposable society and it's insane. Moto started releasing OEM parts for some of their phones, so people could fix them. If more OEMs started selling batteries, parts, extended software support, and repair services, that would be awesome. Seems to work for car manufacturers, anyway. I realize there's probably a lot less to repair on a phone vs. a car, but I see a way to move in that direction. If Samsung makes batteries available for this for some time (and we don't have to rely on sketchy third parties), this phone could be a great deal for people that don't need/want to upgrade all the time."
Android,fe4r79x,t1_fe3onsl,1578862016.0,"I'm guessing that $5 battery is not OEM. That would worry me. Samsung already seriously borked their batteries not that long ago. Cheap third party batteries seem like a huge risk. 

This phone looks awesome because if it can be unlocked and Lineage or something gets ported to it, being able to swap the battery could keep it going a long time. But I would need Samsung or some reputable third party to provide the batteries, else it's not something I'd risk.

Fifty dollars every couple of years would beat the snot out of needing a new phone entirely. It has been so long since I've seen a removable battery, I have no idea how easy it would be to get an OEM battery for a prolonged period of time.

I'm still rocking a Moto G5 Plus, which still mostly gets the job done, but the screen has some wear, the battery is showing signs of aging, and the Bluetooth is getting weird. The price on this is way more than I'd usually spend, but it might be worth it, depending on the support it gets from third party OS and OEM hardware. I am intrigued."

I'm interested in a new phone this year to replace my awesome G5 Plus and the G8 Plus might be on the list, though the lack of Gorilla glass kind of sucks. It really blows that it isn't starting with Android 10, either. That means Android 10 is the last one and it probably won't get it until well after 11 releases. If the price is right though, maybe.

Also kind of odd that I can't really seem to find any real articles about it being released in US. Everything points back to the EU release late last year. Maybe I'm just missing it."
Buffalo,fdnuiq4,t3_em92eu,1578593106.0,"I also wrote the judge, asking for maximum sentence for this piece of shit. He was in a position of power and lied to us all. At a time where this is rampant in our politics, someone needs to draw a line and hold people like Collins to higher standards. 

The dude lied to everyone and is a general scumbag. He tried to use his office to get the clear evidence against him dismissed. Thankfully, that didn't happen, which is why he was forced to plead guilty. But he used his position as a shield. He was already under close review for ethics violations in the House, so this was just him flying too close to the sun. He deserves jail time and lots of it. 

That other pieces of shit are coming to his defense is no surprise. But I want better behavior from our representatives and I hope he'll be an example to others who would also attempt to abuse their positions of power. We need to take a stand against this nonsense.

Years back, before the NYS inspection tags were scanned with a bar code, I used to purposefully wait until the first weekend in the 13th month, so I'd get an extra month. I figured if I was ever stopped, I'd be close enough that they'd let me through.

I got a chance to test this when I was stopped at a checkpoint. The cop said I was expired and I was like ""I have my inspection tomorrow"" (was a Friday night). What I didn't realize was that it was actually past midnight, so it was technically later that day. Officer was all ""you have an appointment on a Sunday?"" and I sheepishly replied ""oh, I guess I mean later today"". Which was honest to god true, I totally did. He gave me a look, said ""take care of it"", and waved me through.

Can't do that anymore, since it's all centrally tracked, so I just get it done as soon as I can, before I forget, in whatever month it's due. And that's my inspection story."

I don't know if it does that any more because I haven't tried. It was a pain in the ass to wait.

I mean, I'm not angry about losing plastic, but this kinda sucks because I know I'm gonna forget my bags frequently and paper isn't really the greatest solution (especially when they don't have handles). I would like to see someone come up with some kind of deposit solution. Like, you get bags that you can reuse, but when you bring them back you get 5 cents for each bag. Something like that. Basically, I think it would be fair to have reusable bags we can borrow and return in the likely event we forget ours, instead of being punished for buying paper bags.
