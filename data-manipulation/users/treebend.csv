Did you just learn about consequentialist ethics"
todayilearned,fgmbytl,t1_fgmbb9w,1580921665.0,"My point was that even at a sports game they don't tolerate nationality.

There was a video of someone at a sports game trying to start a ""Germany"" chant and the crowd was like fuck off bro"
LateStageCapitalism,fgkp493,t1_fgivuhy,1580870535.0,I think it's a coping mechanism for how they're forced to spend so much time working. This guy is posting this bs because he's trying to convince himself it's true. Because if you don't actually have to spend 40 hours a week making money for rich people then... Why am I doing it? He doesn't want to answer that question instead he finds it less painful to drill the worship of work into himself.

LateStageCapitalism,fg2izky,t1_fg27w8q,1580445939.0,"You're right that millionaires aren't as big a problems as billionaires. But I think they say 5% return on index funds is normal. 5% of a million is 50 grand. So if I got this right, just by having a million dollars you could make 50k a year.

A million is still a lot."

You really need a new doctor, this one sucks.

Also it's really hard but please try to take it easy on yourself. You're not a failure. Give yourself time to deal with these problems. You don't have to have everything figured out."
tumblr,ffqnumt,t1_ffqdixv,1580139479.0,"Just like the other guy said I think it's a kind of ""rationality VS nature"" thing.

In chess the rook moves in the least fancy fashion. Left right forward back. Not like bishops who go diagonal or knights who move in L shapes. So it feels like they chose a fundamental chess piece that also happens to be a castle shape and made it fight one of the most wildly shaped bodies in nature, the octopus.

Really feels like a left brain VS right brain kind of thing but I'd be interested if anybody knows more."

LateStageCapitalism,ffil3at,t1_ffgpo82,1579976451.0,"Isn't nazism just like state run slavery. American slavery is like capitalist slavery. Nazis had government ownership of jews and others. And that'd probably be the main reason for nazism to exist. Nazism would be the justification for state run slavery which is the mode of production.

So nazism uses racism to justify a mode of production that uses the labor of the many to benefit the few."

If what you say was true then they'd aim for 25 year olds not 14 year olds. ""they don't recruit 14 year olds"" yes they do. Most highschools have recruiter's offices and JROTC"
