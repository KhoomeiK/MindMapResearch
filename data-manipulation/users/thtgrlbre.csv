Not only to you resort to name calling and accusations because someone said they were talking about the movies. Do people like the comics and books and games? Sure, but the common everyday person who sees it doesn't care about it because they're a movie franchise. I wouldn't act as your are acting with someone who didn't know a book fact about Harry Potter that wasn't in the movies or with a Marvel fan who is only into the movies. You're free to live in your world where canon never contradicts itself and nothing can evolve or change but that says more about you than anyone who happens to like Kylo Ren (or in your words an ""emo wannabe sith""... so mature) or think that two characters match well together.

You act like Star Wars is sacred and it's not, nothing will ever be above criticism or debate. Something can be ""beloved by many"" and have a ton of flaws. People can still like a franchise based solely on movies. You need to calm down, by a lot.

She pushed back when Kylo entered her mind, if she was a padawan she wouldn't have fought back like that. At most she may try to add defenses, but never dull on incase someone more advanced's mind. 

It's not a story of ""oh, let me learn this skill"" like it was with Luke. It's a ""I have this power how do I control it"" story. 

And Im not talking about ""It's canon in the Star Wars universe"", I'm talking the movies.

reylo,fdqm8cz,t1_fdql58k,1578670007.0,"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this. The concept of ""she didn't have any training"" seems null and void to me considering neither did Luke, he spent maybe a fee scenes with Yoda but it never shows him doing a majority of what he does in the series in a training montage. We see her struggle with connecting to the past Jedis, so we know she has her own struggles in the Force. It's not unreasonable to assume that force sensitive people still have a few things they struggle with or one area they never quite get, just because she's good at pushing back in the force or the mind aspect doesn't mean she's perfect. She can do mind tricks, but she struggles with balance, controlling the force, and trusting the force. Those sound like weaknesses to me.

Also, her understanding machinery perfectly makes sense considering whether she eats or not depends on how much she can get from scavenging old ships wrecked from the first war.

I also don't fully get why people think because she has a knack for using the force that means she's too strong. She's  Palpetine's granddaughter, and he's the strongest force user we see. Even stronger than Vadar! If being force sensitive runs in the family ofcourse she's gonna be stronger, add in the fact she's almost a blank slate because she didn't have preconceived opinions or feelings about the force and you get a character who doesn't believe in limits and therefore is limitless. For example, if you're taught 4 or 5 skills in the force you won't think to try anything else or think you haven't been trained and therefore can't do it. Rey doesn't have that, there is no cap on what she can learn because she was not given a guide."
