thisisus,fff2xnh,t3_esjyep,1579874271.0,"How does the viewpoint of growing up and being a self-reliant adult turns you into an addict with a high probability of doing time.   If you are self supporting when you exit school whether that is high school or college, you probably will not have the funds for drugs and alcohol.  Addiction has a strong genetic component.  People come from all walks of live and become addicts.  People who have a strong moral foundation and common sense do not commit crimes so as not to go to prison.   Randal switching colleges just was not that big of a sacrifice.  It was a compromise.  Being able to compromise is a really good trait and will help throughout live and in interpersonal relationships.Randall is a fine man with a good life."
survivor,ffdsld0,t1_fds48gr,1579827876.0,It was so rigged.  Most boring season ever.   I do not think any of those people had ever heard about survivor or played a game in their life.

Ask an ER physician how many broken noses, arms, ribs, etc... they have fixed on battered men.  If you are a man being backed into a corner by a women who  will not allow you to move then get a grip on your manhood.   Set up a shelter for battered men and see how much spare space you have.  Set up a shelter for abused women and it will be at overflow capacity in no time in every city, town, village in America."

Season 22 is the worse season I ever watched.  Jeff Probst should of just written him a check and chucked that season.  I feel like between the intro of Russell Hantz and season 22 it was all very rigged.  I am watching Blood vs Water and like it much better, more real playing with only one idol thus far.  Even Tyson who I despised is okay in Blood vs Water."
thisisus,ffdpp9e,t1_ffdlrb4,1579826001.0,"I just do not see the newer generations living with perpetual childhoods having a better quality of live.  Losing a spouse that you deeply love is devastating.   Rebecca’s kids were on the verge of adulthood giving her a little more luxury to fall apart.   I had a friend who lost her husband who was a really good guy when she had three preschool daughters.  She hung on and did right by her daughters as well as herself but it was not a quick recovery.   You do what you have to do.   Rebecca’s kids were not totally dependent on her.   Rebecca did not just lose her husband, she also lost her home.   Randal supported his mom because he was a really good guy.   Life is not perfect.  People are not perfect.   The whole psychobabble of over analyzing your life in detail is not beneficial.  A lot of people’s personality is just inherent.  Randal was inherently an empathetic guy who could not of felt good being far from his family right after losing his dad."
thisisus,ffcop8d,t1_ffckeue,1579803956.0,"Kids have dropped out of high school to help a financially struggling family particularly with death of the breadwinner.  Loosing your husband that early in life does not compare to loosing a father.   It is just recent generations that think young people cannot be adults and need to be kids forever.  We have kids on the frontlines at 18 or 19, switching colleges not a big deal.  Randall being a empathetic, highly intelligent young man would of been way worse off going away to college.   A son can love his mother and care for her as much as a mother can love her child."

thisisus,ffcjcjr,t1_ffcicen,1579800696.0,"So he did not go to his preferred college but he met Beth, no tragedy there.  Everyone going to college and extending their childhood a few more years is historically a fairly new phenomenon, and do not see society benefitting in any way.  People married and had kids with all the adult responsibilities as teens for many centuries.  Historically humans were agricultural societies.  Kids were working and contributing around the home for ages.   Randall’s childhood ended the day his dad died and he manned up.  His anxiety was always there.   The fact that he could man up shows what a good person he is innately as well as good upbringing.   Life is what happens despite your plans.   Everyone has issues whether they have a perfect childhood or horrid childhood.  I think of the big three as a portrayal of nurture versus nature versus the combo nurture and nature."

We were a 70’s family.  I walked to the drugstore to pick up medication at 7 years old because we were a one car family.   My mom said things about me being her child she never had to worry about, the one she could depend on, etc...  I have no problem with this.  There is a balance between believing a few words can traumatize your child for life and raising tough, realistic kids, able to cope with the vicissitudes of life."
thisisus,ffcf1m7,t1_ffc5jsb,1579798064.0,"What is wrong with a mom getting help and support from her beloved son.   Helping his mother is very cathartic for Randall.  When someone dies a youngish tragic death the worst feeling is the helplessness of not being able to do anything.   Randall stayed pro-active while mourning.  When I was Randall’s age I was a self-supporting adult in the Army under unnecessary pressure and some necessary pressure.  You can be a man or woman at 18.   You can make sacrifices, or by changing colleges compromises, without ill effect.   Randall’s anxiety are inherited as well as the product of a high I.Q. Accompanied by emotional intelligence and sensitivity.   He turned out great, he has a job he loves, and a wife he is passionate about."

Russell is a woman-hating short, ugly, balding, troll with a chip on his shoulder and Jeff was greatly disappointed that he did not win.  Bob was a handsy dude and it was edited out turning him into an anti-hero who took home not only the grand prize but an extra $100,000.

So while not condoning Missy and Elizabeth’s semi-true accusations, I feel like they were put in a bad spot all the way around.   Kelly made it part of game play."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffc82nc,t3_esqtl8,1579793686.0,"The exact percentage of cops that beat and abuse their wives and children is not important.  What is important is that other officers and whole police departments condone this behavior allowing cops to beat, batter, and abuse with impunity.   So what is important is that blue wives have no escape because reporting escalates their danger.   So even if it is only 10%, it is more significant than the general population because cops know where the shelters are.  Other cops will participate in harassing the women. Cops who condone domestic violence are just as bad and guilty as the abuser."

You are so clumsy.  Maybe he digs his fingers into  her and jacks her around, then will swear that is not physical assault because he did not punch her.   There are lots of ways men abuse women and justify it.  Those men do not self report.  Throwing things and claiming I threw it at the wall.   Rage is violence especially when someone is taller, wider, and stronger."

survivor,ffakzee,t3_es78n6,1579738373.0,I believe there are juries that definitely would of voted for Ozzy (and I think he only lost by one vote) but playing the game is knowing your jury.   Every game is different because players are different.  Russell would not of lasted beyond the first or second tribal counsel with a survivor cast of applicants.  He was put in with a cast of recruits.  Plus I have no doubt his idols were carefully planted for him to find.

They should get a little more creative. Just plain lazy writers if they want to change things up make it about competition and game play.  How about a season where the survivors each get a section of beach and survive on their own, meet up for challenges, and the bottom person is booted out.  Then merge as a group when down to 10 to 12 players.  They could make that fascinating.   They could have a season of identical twins separated by tribes.   Anything but EOE."

Sorry, not charging Jay with accessory after the fact, and at least getting a year in prison with probation is ludicrous if his story is true.   If a witness cooperates they usually get a reduced sentences but they are charged with something.  Disposing of a body is about as bad as it gets.  Something really weird going on for sure."

survivor,fekdu0b,t1_fekcxsl,1579197966.0," No he took the million dollar prize, and wanted CBS to pay additional funds for taxes because of controversy about Sue and Wigglesworth being fed protein bars by production staff.   If CBS paid $300,000 for his taxes, he would owe money in taxes on that $300,000.  It would be endless.  Anyway BS because he also owed taxes on other income."
survivor,fekdfhc,t1_fekbktw,1579197723.0,"Like you said there were locals probably working in production as well as food service, etc...  I had a girlfriend who was from Borneo.  They do not hold hands in public.  They do not kiss, I mean like ever.  She married a service member and learned about kissing, and yes she liked, liked it very much.  Even if I find it way too inhibited, their country.  Very disgusting to streak around naked.  I do not think other cast members liked it.  It came up in discussion and no one said yeah more power to him.   I think CBS just does not know where to draw lines."
survivor,fek755u,t3_epkzso,1579194004.0,"Rich is a con man.  He went to jail for tax evasion and blamed CBS.  Even if CBS payed taxes on his prize, he would still have to file taxes on his total income.  It was not just the prize money he failed to pay taxes on.  He is so cheap and stubborn, he did not pay back taxes when he got out and had to go back.   Running around nude was gross and unacceptable.   Borneo is a country with very conservative personal mores.  Running around nude is so disrespectful to the host country.  They do not call us Ugly Americans for no reason."

thisisus,fek48h0,t3_epjdnk,1579192269.0,"Part of my thought is this intruder did not expect a man in the house, maybe been watching the family.  It looks pretty real, do not think it is a hallucination.   I think Randall talks him into leaving before someone gets hurt."
thisisus,fek3ilw,t3_ep6xf8,1579191838.0,"I think the pineapple lights were brilliant.  I have actually been to a Jimmy Buffet party, and those lights would be a prize.  I do not think they portray Madison badly, just her scenes are brief, so do not get any real depth."
thisisus,fek32go,t3_epjeus,1579191565.0,"I think it is possible that Sophie got pregnant when they were together and kept it from him.  She could be calling to tell him we need to talk.   Maybe a long shot?   He was on drugs at the time and Sophie ran fast and far, but is feeling guilty.   I love Madison.  I do not think her neurosis about weight is any worse than Kate’s.  Kevin’s closest relationship is Kate.  People seem to drift towards the familiar."
thisisus,fek19cz,t1_fei2qfc,1579190450.0,"Some people need to vent before they can have a reasonable conversation with a reasonable person.   Kate is not the most reasonable person, so, I understand his need to talk to someone.   He had a heart attack at 38.  It is one of those wake you up moments because your life depends on it.   It is one thing for Kate to not be gung-ho in the CrossFit lifestyle but she should of been more supportive.   He felt the need to lie about it and rightly so.    Feeling the need to hideout and lie about working out like it is a meth habit says a lot about their relationship."
thisisus,fejuu05,t3_epgir6,1579186363.0,"Any parent that has a special needs child needs to understand it is okay to mourn the child you dreamed of, so, you can love the child you do have.   It takes a moment to adjust your expectations.  Whether your child is autistic, deaf, blind, or physically disabled, you start enjoying a different set of milestones and are a little more patient once you are allowed to go through the normal stages of grief.  When you cannot talk about your feelings honestly then it will cause more problems.   Kate is adjusting while Toby is stuffing his feelings.  Hopefully, they work through it."
survivor,feh07ya,t1_feeh6uh,1579106405.0,"I do not mind a bland player of the chop wood/carry water type, but Tommy was a whiner.  Whiners should not be winners.  They gave us no reason Tommy should win..  did he help a lot around the camp?   Anything.  Production should of gave us something to not find this a most unsatisfying win no matter how deep they had to dig.  Fabio also was a whiner.   Jeff has no problem with those bland whiner winners but a Natalie White he found really difficult to swallow."
survivor,fegz3ni,t3_eoks7t,1579105722.0,"There seems to be an abundance of lawyers.  Doctors are also well represented but never seem to do well.  I could be wrong but has a doctor ever done well.  I know Mick made final 3 but being a zero at FTC is almost worse than being on jury.  My theory is that the intensity and years of stress it takes to become a medical doctor, kind of like they do not have the ability to burn with the kind of fire it takes to be a real contender on Survivor.  Not a diss on doctors because it takes a lot to become a doctor even if you get out debt free which most do not."
survivor,fegy6f4,t1_feejt8h,1579105152.0,I have known lots of guys like coach.  Maybe younger guys are cooler and do not feel the need to be legendary heroes in their own mind.   So I find coach dull but if you did not have experience with this type of walking talking cliche I can see how it would be fascinating in a weird way.
survivor,fegxg48,t3_eoqm3u,1579104697.0,"Natalie White.   She knew first hand how despised Russell Hantz was.   Mick just ended up being a non-factor even though he was a great looking guy who was competent, somehow a wallflower."
survivor,fegujlo,t3_eop2gp,1579102848.0,"Jane, Nicaragua, because she was so annoying but so great.  A 57-year-old woman (looking her age and then some) kicking butt in a strength challenge against buff boys and beauty queens — only on Survivor."
survivor,fegttj2,t1_fegfsw8,1579102383.0,"Tommy from last season was a whiner when he thought people were going to vote for him.  Fabio was a whiner when he was not selected to go with his mom on reward.   He complained he only got to see his mom twice a year.  Tough luck dude, she obviously is not your priority.  Holly got to spend time with her husband, someone she lives with and probably missed more.  Cannot stand whiners.  Hate to be sexist but whining men are the worse.  If a woman is a whiner, particularly a hypocritical whiner, it is not acceptable.  Men can whine like little cry babies and be winners.  What weird standards we have."
