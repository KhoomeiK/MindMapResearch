gay,fe8sc2z,t3_eo34sd,1578930125.0,"Focus on taking care of yourself right now. You mentioned you're staying with a friend; that's good. If this is a temporary arrangement, I would figure out your next step. Health Care, phone bill, car? Not sure if you relied on your parents for that kind of stuff, but I would sort all that out as well.

You didn't do anything wrong, and it's not your job to help them accept you the way you are. That's their job. That being said, I've had several friends go through almost the same situation, and all of their parents eventually came around. 

My mom never kicked me out, but when I came out to her at 15, she made my life hell. It took her a solid 4 years to come around. I know I said it's not your job to help them accept it, but I think what helped the most is when my mom would hassle me about being gay, I would just tell her off and walk away/ leave. She needed to realize that she didn't have control over me and that I was happy the way I am and shaping my life the way I wanted it to be.

I hope this all makes sense? I'm not the best at giving advise but I saw your post and felt like I couldn't just ignore someone looking for advice who's gone through a similar experience as me."
Baking,fe7kciz,t1_fe6kwoa,1578915803.0,"Here's the recipe I always use: https://preppykitchen.com/how-to-make-swiss-buttercream/

I used a cup of frozen raspberries (thawed and puréed) to flavor the buttercream for this cake. If I just want vanilla, I usually do a tablespoon of pure vanilla extract (I really like vanilla. Haha)"
