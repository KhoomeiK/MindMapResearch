truegaming,fghscqn,t3_ey9up4,1580792474.0,"If you like Immersive Sims, there are a lot of games to play: Ultima Underworld 1 & 2, System Shock 1 & 2, Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri, Thief 1, 2 & 3, Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Dishonored 1 & 2 and Prey.

But the genre isn't dead, either, there's System Shock Remake and System Shock 3 in the making, we had a spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld too, Underworld Ascendant, although it isn't a good contender for the genre, sadly.

But apart from these more root games we're having a lot of big games being made with the design philosophy of Immersive Sims, like Zelda:BotW, RDR2 and probably Cyberpunk 2077, so the genre is most alive and will probably be the ruling design philosophy for games in the future, mark my words."
truegaming,fghr25e,t1_fgg6vlu,1580791477.0,"Yup, Immersive Sims became part of what makes good modern sandbox games. BotW is the greatest of examples, that game is Nintendo showing how appealing the concept Looking Glass envisioned all those years ago can be.

Also, System Shock Remake and a third installment are in the works, and for who don't know, System Shock is one of the fundamental games, along Ultima Underworld, to employ the design philosophy of Immerisve Sims.

I don't expect Immersive Sims to die. Maybe the more niche games to follow the philosophy will stay in obscurity, but the idea is stronger, it's a logical statement to what games want to become, so it's just natural that they'll implement more and more elements of Immersive Sims, even if inadvertently."
