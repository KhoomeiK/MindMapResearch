Tell her that it’s way okay to do the modified exercises, it’s okay to go slower on the treadmill then they recommend and that it’s okay to grab a weight lower then recommend. I’ve been going for 6 mo and still have to do those things! It’s more important to push your limits then do what the instructor says."
