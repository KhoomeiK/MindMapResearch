TooAfraidToAsk,ffq5bhb,t3_eukwcp,1580121326.0,"I have a 9-5 and I personally love it. I did my time in very minimal wage jobs and now I’m lucky enough to have a very decent income. But I enjoyed all of my jobs. You have to find the fun in everything you do. I met some amazing people, lived with randoms, had very little money and still managed to enjoy my spare time. And now I’m in a 9-5 I genuinely love and actually get paid well for it. Life can only be what you make of it."
tifu,ffppjor,t3_eudp05,1580101287.0,I’m still waiting for a pic. For research purposes.
oddlysatisfying,ffpinro,t3_eucmz6,1580095959.0,I want to peel so bad.
buffy,ffpc80b,t1_ffoubuq,1580091419.0,Me too! Anything Anya please!
buffy,ffpc762,t1_ffocyl2,1580091404.0,Haha! I love that.
buffy,ffpc6kw,t1_ffm5zcq,1580091392.0,Me too!
buffy,ffpc67p,t1_ffm7lhq,1580091385.0,Right? I love her so much.
buffy,ffpc5pq,t1_ffmw7b2,1580091375.0,Sounds like my kind of girl!
progresspics,ffh9bj8,t3_etk9vq,1579926854.0,Damn dude you had a superhero glow up! Well done!
AskReddit,ffc5bde,t3_esr647,1579791874.0,Customer service.
buffy,ffc4cte,t1_ffc3rb9,1579791223.0,100000% agree. It’s a beautifully haunting piece of art that needs several awards.
buffy,ffc47rw,t3_esma6q,1579791129.0,What an amazing share. I’m very glad to you are coping. Just goes to show how relevant Buffy is for so many of our situations.
TooAfraidToAsk,ff8so2u,t3_es8i73,1579694568.0,Those aren’t good lip injections. I have a lot of friends with lip filler and they all look naturally full because they’re done correctly. You only notice the botched ones.
suggestmeabook,ff5pfbd,t1_ff5pb9b,1579604656.0,Thank you!
suggestmeabook,ff5ordq,t3_ersr97,1579603692.0,The Gone novels are pretty good!
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5opwv,t3_erst5m,1579603631.0,I don’t wear a bra. Fuck society lol.
oddlysatisfying,ff5ootr,t3_erp343,1579603584.0,I really want to learn this. Pottery is the most satisfying.
ThriftStoreHauls,ff5omrg,t3_erjkpo,1579603501.0,Omg this is amazing!
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5ojrg,t3_erquc3,1579603378.0,Anything bigger than 6 inches. 5-6 I would consider average and quite a good size. But ultimately it doesn’t matter so much in terms of performance.
1200isplenty,ff5a2iq,t1_ff57hun,1579584823.0,That’s not so bad! I have a rule that I’m allowed to go to ‘maintenance’ calories if I need to but I’m never allowed to go over that! :)
1200isplenty,ff5a0gr,t1_ff56s2b,1579584770.0,You’ve got this! And thank you :)
1200isplenty,ff4vrl9,t1_ff4vob5,1579573617.0,Exactly! If I don’t give in I just end up eating all this stupid crap and I’m not even satisfied.
funny,ff4utpn,t3_ergzai,1579572968.0,It took me way too long to realize that there was only one real dude.
buffy,ff4umxp,t1_ff4lp3z,1579572840.0,She’s EVIL!
buffy,ff2wabb,t3_er36p5,1579526571.0,"I actually find these guys hilarious now. The bit where the guy is like, “oh stop, me? No!” just gets me every time."
buffy,fexpvhe,t1_fex80zz,1579434607.0,"Yeah I think that’s definitely been my problem. I am not a huge kid person in general, especially bratty ones."
buffy,fexppar,t1_fewo2p6,1579434517.0,Thank you for sharing your opinion! I’m going into this season with a fresh start. So far it isn’t too bad. Although I definitely still prefer earlier seasons without her. But I will press on and see how I go watching the later seasons this time around!
buffy,fexp15m,t1_fexemag,1579434272.0,That’s honestly the best thing she’s ever said haha thank you. I am now a few episodes in and so far she isn’t grating on me as badly as she used to!
buffy,fewn0tx,t1_fewm10j,1579415259.0,When Buffy jumped I think I cried for a week!
buffy,fewn0ao,t1_fewm48f,1579415242.0,She’s definitely more tolerable later on!
buffy,fewmz0a,t1_fewmojh,1579415203.0,This is what I need to hear to try and like her. I’m really going to go in with an open mind this time watching. Although I think I also struggle as I don’t find the actress that appealing either.
buffy,fewlw8v,t1_fewlke2,1579414043.0,That’s fair haha
1200isplenty,fej7czo,t1_feh5z39,1579159972.0,"To be fair, I would have asked for a refund of all the cokes I’d unwittingly had thinking they were diet. Health aside. You paid for something believing it was Diet Coke and you didn’t get what you paid for."
flexibility,fegcm2p,t1_fegajb6,1579087758.0,*claps* I see what you did there!
todayilearned,feg8wib,t3_eop78t,1579082679.0,I experience this everyday because I have death anxiety. Despite being completely healthy and young.
flexibility,feg8dzt,t3_eozter,1579081936.0,Ok for a second there I didn’t think you were wearing pants.
truechildfree,feg5mo2,t3_eon4o7,1579078038.0,"Nope, I love my freedom. Other people have made their choices and they knew the consequences when they did. I made some stupid decisions with credit cards when I was in my early 20s and didn’t have any disposable income at the time. But it was my decision and I got through it by sacrificing my social life. You just have to live with your decisions and enjoy the good when you’ve worked for it!"
Fitness,fdv0dvq,t3_en5j18,1578741672.0,"9 eggs a week isn’t even that much! Have you tried sitting them down and educating them on nutrition? Maybe you guys could even watch an educational program together. I’d also try and explain to them quite calmly that your health is important and you have done your research. 

If that doesn’t work, could you buy your own eggs and cook them without them knowing? Or maybe get some high protein food and just say you love the taste and don’t mention it’s for the protein."
suggestmeabook,fdlb3rd,t1_fdk2nn8,1578520252.0,Yes!!! That’s the one. Disturbed me for weeks.
suggestmeabook,fdjk5ea,t3_elkusf,1578474633.0,A short story inside Stephen Kings book called The Skeleton Crew. It was about a doctor stranded on a rock island.
myfavoritemurder,fdjfurz,t3_elf0v2,1578469011.0,Ooo yes!!! Listening now!
childfree,fdglhj3,t3_el0tev,1578401331.0,This drives me insane. I had a doctor tell me that I needed to have a baby (I was 19 at the time) to stop my period pains once. Oh and to make sure I didn’t get cancer.
AskReddit,fdg864z,t3_el2az5,1578384090.0,Buffy! I’m down for this.
loseit,fddln2a,t3_eksb3o,1578316957.0,"Hi all! It’s 11:30pm here in Aus and I’m making a vow to start right here, right now. Not tomorrow, not Monday next week, not next month. Now.

I’ve struggled with weight all my life. I’m 97kg and I’m a short ass female. I want to be healthy and stop wasting my life away.

I’m sure you all know by now that there is a bushfire crisis here. It’s spurred me on to get active so I can be fit enough to volunteer if something as awful as this happens again. All I can do is donate money and it just doesn’t feel like enough. So today is my day!"
buffy,fdcy9zq,t1_fdcy3rw,1578287900.0,Ahh yes I get that. Thank you! That must be frustrating as an actor who might actually want to do their own stunts.
ketorecipes,fdcwqqs,t3_ekneqa,1578286559.0,I wanna put my face in it.
BeautyGuruChatter,fdcwjqo,t3_ekodlv,1578286390.0,Fucking Tina.
buffy,fdctdph,t1_fdc1p9f,1578283766.0,Oh I’ve always seen that version. Did you maybe have a specific box set you rewatched before watching on amazon?
