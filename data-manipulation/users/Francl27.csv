I know two people who have a baby that is just happy everywhere. My kids were screaming if they were in place in their car seat for longer than 2 minutes. Needless to say, it was very hard to do anything.

My kids were relatively good sleepers, some just cry all day.

The baby stage wasn't that bad, it's when they start moving that it gets hard because you can't do anything without being interrupted and you need to keep an eye on them at all times. The second part changes as they get older, the first... I'll let you know when it does (my kids are 11),

So it depends on what your life is like. I've been able to watch TV shows as long as I can pause them, and play video games that I can pause. I can't read anymore because it just sucks to be interrupted every 5 minutes, so I just read at bedtime now.

But my annoyance with OP is that he/she has a very biased opinion about the adoption world. It's not ALL bad. For one thing - for women who really make the CHOICE to give up their children (no, they are not all coerced), it gives them an option to pick the people who will take care of them. And yes, paperwork is ridiculously expensive, but if you've had to deal with lawyers about anything.. it's always ridiculously expensive (although frankly, when I adopted, it was $14k.

What's hilarious is that you don't know me. I'm a liberal and I'm 100% for helping the working class and helping people who don't make enough money. 

But what you're suggesting is that people who want to adopt should basically give all that money to someone they don't know instead of being parents themselves. That has nothing to do with helping each other as a society with helping people who are struggling. You basically want people who want to adopt to just give $30k to strangers.

That's not ok.

Also, what you completely seem to be missing is that, before we adopted our children... they were not our children. We didn't even know about them, and we didn't love them. So the whole ""if you love your children you should have made sure that they stayed with their birthmother"" thing makes absolutely no sense.

Parenting,feujwcb,t3_eqnb1r,1579387235.0,"There's a line between ""don't let your child do that"" and ""correct them when they do that.""

You'll never be able to prevent your child from doing certain things because they are children and WILL be annoying at some point, but you can teach them that it's rude (which your friends don't seem to be doing). I mean... it's called trying to raise a decent human being."

dogs,fet0j0d,t1_fesxnvk,1579370715.0,Well they still have people interested in the puppies though...
Fantasy,fet0g1p,t1_fesyxf4,1579370687.0,"You can't remember because NOTHING happened that actually moved the story on, except maybe the last chapter or something."
Adoption,fesz30s,t3_eqjc4o,1579370348.0,"Clothes, cellphone (at 12 pretty much every kid has one sadly), computer for school, activities cost a ton of money... plus camp and whatnot if you're working during school breaks.

My daughter grew from size 6 to 9 in shoes in 1 month, for example, so we spent a LOT of money on shoes (hiking boots for scouts, I usually buy them for cheaper online but I had no heads up)...

I only buy cheap clothes though, taking advantage of coupons, sales, and clearance (I'll never spend over $8 for a shirt, for example).

And medical bills, although I think that former foster care children are covered by Medicare until 18? But we spent $3000 on my kids last year just for therapy because of that ""out of network"" BS."
dogs,fesx781,t3_eqjic1,1579369839.0,"Well, responsible breeders don't breed unless they have a waiting list in the first place... so they don't need to advertise.

Hopefully your friend learns her lesson and stops breeding her dogs."
sahm,feswq5o,t3_eqjkjb,1579369724.0,I totally relate.
pokemongo,fesarmu,t1_fes3yua,1579363341.0,I've barely found any in the last few months and need more candies to evolve mine. And I need shinies.
pokemongo,fesaol6,t3_eqg4eu,1579363309.0,"It's going to be 25 degrees here. Really not looking forward to it. Good thing I already have a high IV to evolve, so I just need more candies and ideally a couple of shinies."
