depression,fdp3o16,t1_fdp178e,1578619240.0,"Yeah I get you, I had a profound dream not too long ago where I had been given one day to live, and I thought fuck me who do I talk to, what do I do? It was a mad scramble and ultimately I found no consolation and no resolution, just sadness and fear. Before I believed I wanted to die, but knowing I was GOING to die regardless of my will it made me regretful and deeply unsatisfied.

Though reflecting on it it's kinda funny. It's certainly made me a bit more present of the few people I do know and made me appreciate the current moment a bit more because man that dream was long and I really was convinced that was the end. To wake up from certain demise.

Even if in the worst case you can guarantee nobody cares about your right now, eventually you will be, hell you just might be right now and you don't even know it. Take care of yourself and subsequently others and the rest will fall into place without you even realising it."
depression,fdnc099,t3_em9ryy,1578582522.0,"Never really thought about it from the perspective of my funeral, but I know what you mean. Shit like that always bit more bittersweet than it has any right to be. 

I suppose its just simply because of a lack of something so fundamental, basic and deeply comforting. It's literally in our genetic programming to be social and to seek love, to be found lacking our body punishes us to try and push us in the right direction.

I don't have any good advice really, just venting a similar ailment. I hope we find what we're looking for sometime soon. Really I don't want to know many people, just even one person that makes me feel like real person would be nice."
depression,fdn6p8q,t3_elycos,1578578782.0,"I know exactly what you mean. I was hopelessly depressed and stagnant from 17-23. a few glimmers of hope maybe surmounting to about half a year over those 6 years. It took me till 23 to finally realise how utterly vacant those years were. And now i'm 24 and i'm finally addressing those problems.


God its so painful, so fucking painful but i'll be damned if i'll let it get the better of me any more. You can succumb to the feelings of diminished returns and sunk cost but that'll only keep that cycle going and then you can say you spent even more years depressed...


Cliche but an important idiom: The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the second best time is right now. Giving in to the idea that its too late is just depression talking, don't let your past totally define who you are now, let what you do now define that."
depression,fdhbmq7,t1_fdhb218,1578419476.0,"Any time my guy, take care."
AskMen,fdh7otf,t1_fdh7cto,1578417169.0,Not funny? fair enough. Sexist? No
depression,fdh6l02,t3_eldrdz,1578416479.0,"Hey man I'm listening and you shouldn't apologise for that. I'm sure it feels like the end of the world but go third person mode right now, you're 19 years old. nine TEEN. You have the whole world ahead of you man, I know that might not be comforting to think about but honestly its taken me till 24 to get a grasp of what the fuck is going on, and even still I'm learning so much every day it makes me feel like a fucking moron at times. But that's ok. That's life. We all get dealt different cards.

I don't have all the answers for you and frankly nobody will, when you dig yourself a hole I think it takes great courage and strength to pull yourself out. You gotta find a ledge, something to help you start climbing out. You're at the prime of your youth. You can learn multiple trades and still be classified as young by the time you're done. Find what you wanna do and start doing research and learning, try to reconnect with old friends, don't suffer alone. I've done this too and man its so cold and makes the whole process of recovery that much slower. 

I have a lot more to say but for now just know i'm rooting for you man. You may not have done what you needed to be happy right now, but that doesn't mean you can't start right now and get to where you want to be. Take good care."
depression,fdh5ote,t3_eldtcc,1578415929.0,"I felt the same way about the gym, but honestly yeah the literal strength it gives you makes you feel good about yourself. Physically and mentally this is proven to be the case. Most importantly, it gives you discipline and targets to beat. That gives stability and drive to improve.

As for cleaning, man nobody likes living in trash. I mean i'm not going crazy keeping everything spotless but I do believe that when shit is messy its because mentally i'm a mess, you can find like 10-15 minutes a day to make your place look like somewhere you wanna be, even if you don't want to you'll always be thankful you did after and in the future. 

Truly the best things for you don't give immediate short term satisfaction. They have to be cultivated, understood and trained. It's a labour of love. 

You don't have to nail it all right away. When I started going to the gym I sat on the machines for an hour and left, then i'd do a little bit after sitting and reading what to do, then eventually I found exercises and workouts I liked and wanted to do. Nothing happens overnight friend, take it slow and be true to yourself. Take care."
depression,fdh4bwe,t3_eldbf9,1578415093.0,"For what its worth I'm literally employed as a software developer and I feel this way, imposter syndrome is huge in software dev. You gotta accept that especially in this field which is always shifting, you're always gonna be learning new shit, getting stuck on problems, ending up in google hellholes trying to find answers.

i'd stick it out if you made it this far, you can overcome and surmount most things if you really give enough of a shit. And honestly that strength puts you leagues above a lot of people in the industry so I really wouldn't sweat it. You got this man"
AskMen,fdgsgxx,t1_fdgs97n,1578407168.0,"doubling down because you didn't get a joke, yikes."

depression,fdgmzpe,t3_elb1nc,1578402727.0,"I'd recommend looking into mindfulness and meditation, that really helped me get me out of a similar mindset. You'll come to understand that there is no ""true self"" to be unlocked. Being in tune with your mind, thoughts and surroundings will have a far more profound effect than any regimen you can devise in my opinion."
depression,fdgfwvi,t3_el54zx,1578394971.0,"I feel like part of depression is that literal brain shutdown so its unsurprising that you end up literally going brain dead when you subject yourself to such stagnation. I'm still personally recovering from it but honestly what helps is just making sure you get some sort of mental stimulation.

Even brain training apps really help remind you that you're not fucking retarded or at the very least show you where you stand and give you a way to improve. Pushing further from that literally doing khan academy courses, general learning activities, etc for like an hour a day really makes a difference. Just my 2c."
Tinder,fdavn6c,t1_fdasenv,1578250817.0,"Beard thing is just well, yeah pretty standard in UK asian culture to be fair. the skinny t shirt year its not the best, might just zoom crop the image when i use it to give less of that vibe. Thanks"
Tinder,fdapap6,t1_fdaigwc,1578248629.0,"Yeah I don't really have many group photos. 

Is the penult that weird? haha. I recieved pretty good feedback on it so I kept it, but it makes me look gay? lmao damn"
Tinder,fd9kbkm,t1_fd8i1w0,1578234612.0,"Stats say its a losing game but for a lot of people its better than nothing. What's the alternative? It's clearly not just for people with no social lives seeming as its so widely used. Friend groups only branch out so far, it's a matter of the fact that we just can't be easily exposed to new people in the same way dating apps allow you to be.

What do you suggest people do instead of dating apps?"
Tinder,fd5kwgl,t1_fd5jfyx,1578178638.0,"Appreciate your honesty, might drop or crop the sweat pants one, that's just there cause i wanted to make a joke about the t shirt reference haha. 

You think I should move the gucci one to second or first slot?"
Tinder,fd5ixpm,t1_fd5h5fv,1578178090.0,"Yeah as a dude who absolutely hates taking photos... man its hard haha.  I'd honestly just look at the way other people take selfies online and in this post, learn good angles, to smile naturally by watching something funny, etc. If i try and take a selfie i'll take about 50 photos and keep 1 or sometimes 0, shit aint easy my man. It's just something you'll have to learn"
Tinder,fd5i58w,t1_fd5g09q,1578177914.0,"So I mean I'm not attacking you but yeah you claim to be an attractive person who gets approached by women, I think you have a bit of bias then... I've never been approached in my life and generally get next to no attention from women. 

Though tinder and bumble completely changed that for me as i've actually had success through that. I think a lot of dude's just don't get that attention and naturally turn to dating apps. Maybe there isn't anything particularly wrong with me or other dudes, but we're just not as fortunate its as simple as that."
Tinder,fd5h7n5,t1_fd5cso4,1578177607.0,"Irrelevant I know but your anthem is a tune.

Your profile isn't bad, my personal opinion is your ordering isn't superb but this is obviously just personal preference. I'd say the order of the images should be 1 3 4 6 5 2.

Your bio isn't enlightening to what your about but I mean it isn't bad either, these things are really hit and miss, it might be worth shaking it up due to the lack of results."
Tinder,fd5f95o,t1_fd53jme,1578177038.0,"I'll be honest, you have 4 photos but in reality you only have 2. 1,3 and 4 are basically the same, i'd get rid of 3 and 4. I'd even go so far as to say get rid of 1 and try taking some more selfies because you're decent looking with a clearly defined jaw, you just need to take some better pictures You really need more photos.

The bios.. I don't really like but I haven't got much to add. Maybe keep it short and sweet and don't do the whole ""i'm not like other guys"" thing."
Tinder,fd5dsd0,t1_fd56ib8,1578176664.0,"7 and 9 are much better than some of your other front photos, i would put them much closer to the front"

Tinder,fd5d1vk,t1_fd5ac5f,1578176410.0,"Mostly everyone knows its a horribly skewed odds, but why keep your odds of matching at 0.1% when you can get some honesty about shit pictures/bio and increase those odds to even like 2%, if you're gonna play the game you might as well try and play it right."
Tinder,fd5ck4w,t3_ei2m96,1578176275.0,"Hey Guys 24 UK M here, uninstalled a few weeks ago due to next to no matches but i've got a few new photos so any brutally honest feedback would be appreciated too. Also any thoughts on order?
