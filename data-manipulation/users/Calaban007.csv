I just didn't care in high school and I did go to community college but dropped out withing the first month.  

I've worked my ass off and went back and got some schooling and technical certificates in electronic engineering but not an actual degree.  I currently have a Emgineering job and make very good money for the area I live in but I can't get any other job that would pay me close to what I'm making now.  I've worked at the same company for 18 years and started as a machine operator and worked my way up to this point.  I'm too old to start over.  Dont get me wrong.  I love what I do and am not looking to leave but should something happen to my job I'm royally fucked.  If I had any type of engineering degree, hell any bachelors degree, my chances of finding a job in my current pay range would be no problem combined with my experience."

The emperor's goal in ROTJ was to have Luke give in to his anger and hate which would open him to be turned to the darkside.  He knew Vader would stop Luke's strike and Luke would go on to beat Vader and then he'd be able to make Luke his apprentice once Vader was dead.
