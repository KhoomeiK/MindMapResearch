FemaleDatingStrategy,ffepowe,t1_ffc7quy,1579859227.0,How did they even hide all their fat in their online photos?
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffepndt,t1_ffcp9jp,1579859166.0,"Omg so true. This guy was a catfish and all the photos he put on social media were from a few years ago when he was fitter, but also I caught him in so many little lies (that I didn't tell him about). But honestly, why do people catfish? If you're attracted to their picture version but not their real life version, what do they think we're gonna do? Magically get attracted to their (usually compulsive liar) personality? In some ways they just seem to think we're so naive and will believe everything they say, but it's kinda unbelievable when u face it in real life cause youd have to be a bit on the slow side to believe everything they're saying"
