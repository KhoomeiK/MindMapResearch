Like he could've just put his arm in front of her so she'd had to stop, the car was going really slowly so why did he grab her so strongly? It seems to me it was set up that's why the car was so slow"

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdij6mz,t1_fdhvy2h,1578444106.0,"I never said she would be less 'worthy as a partner' its just what I find attractive and what I don't. I also totally respect it if you don't like that, you don't have to be attracted to me: that's my point from the get-go, you can't force someone to be attracted to you."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdiie71,t1_fdi1dm9,1578443603.0,"This is so dumb?
How do you know who I am and am not attracted to? Who are you to decide whether whom I like is right or wrong, and whether that 'follows patriarchal beliefs'. Also a woman can stop being attracted to a man because everybody has seen their body, the same way a man can stop being attracted to another man, a woman to another woman, and every convination you see posible, because this has nothing to do with whatever you're mentioning, different people find different body types attractive, and different personalities, and that includes how open others are about their own body.
I don't get how me knowing what I find attractive and what I don't is so improbable to you, I know that I, and only myself, am not attracted to that kind of thing. The same way some people enjoy having their partners fucked by someone else in front of them, I enjoy my sexuality private between me and my partner."

teenagers,fd3diea,t1_fd3bgb2,1578157218.0,"I don't agree. I've joined servers that were already, idk, two months old? And it was already imposible to start because inflation had gone so high. Using in game items as currency here has the same problem as in any other game, good e.g. Is WoW. As you can get unlimited money by farming, there will be more and more money on the system generation inflation, you can reduce it by creating money sinks, like having npcs sell stuff so money leaves the system or penalising the player if they die, or you can create another system where currency can't be just mined. You can have players send request instead of npcs doing so, etc."
