You didn't read my comment properly. I actually agreed with the person to some degree when I said;

>Sure, none of these things ended up changing overnight.

I acknowledge and agree that things do not progress immediately to the end goal laid out by a movement. What I was taking issue with was the suggestion that because of this fact, vegans shouldn't advocate for an end of animal rights, rather that they advocate for compromise, reducing the real-world progress even further. In the examples I mentioned, they didn't compromise in their advocacy, despite compromises in real-world progress. Perhaps if they had instead advocated for a compromise, there would have been a compromise to that compromise. As these movements were (mostly) successful, I think it's probably wise to emulate their advocacy and activism approaches to some degree for modern issues in society. In other words, advocating for veganism, not a reduction in the consumption of animal products."

No, it's not. The worlds largest medical organisations state that a vegan diet is healthy when done right (check the sidebar of /r/vegan for information). Given this fact, the only reasons left for consuming animal products are convenience and taste, which are both about your own pleasure, as they are not necessary.

> Nutiritonal science is so contradictory, so multifactorial, so individual, so convoluted and wholly incomplete that to speak with such *conviction* and such *authority* on the matter is rudely absurd. 

This is meaningless. Something can he complicated and still have an answer. Besides, I'm not speaking with authority, the experts are. All I'm doing is aligning my actions with the conclusions of sound ethical arguments, and suggesting that everyone else should too, if they care about ethical consistency.

>Just be straight up with me, I can handle brutal honesty; if you thrive on the vegan diet, and I *suffer inconceivably from any variation of the plant-based diet*, would you still want me to eat plant-based? Should I become a martyr,  but you go on living?

I'm not playing this game. Most people would not suffer inconceivably from a plant based diet. If you do have some rare condition requiring you to eat animal flesh, fine, you can start an ethical discussion from there. However, considering that the vast majority of people are perfectly capable of going vegan, they just dont want to, that discussion is a long way off."

I understand you are having a discussion with someone else in this part, but I felt the need to reply to it. It is not gatekeeping to say what I said. Honestly, the the whole gatekeeping meme on reddit annoys me, because while it is sometimes useful and accurate, it has also ruined many discussions about terminology and what certain beliefs logically entail. People will just turn up and exclaim 'gatekeeping!' with no further discussion or justification. 

It is not gatekeeping to say that you cannot be a feminist and also be against women's right to vote. It is not gate keeping to say you cannot be an abolitionist while owning slaves. Sure, you *physically* can, but that is not an interesting observation, nor is it the meaning that the word 'cannot' has in this context - it clearly means that you *logically* cannot.

>u/PleaseDontHateMeeee, I'm sorry but the same reasoning doesn't exactly fully apply. I know I'm gonna get downvoted here but I'm so absolutely sick of this. You CAN be both, you can draw similar conclusions, but this is like saying you can't be antinatalist and a biological parent.

See examples above. To expand on the veganism/antinatalism angle, much like the other examples, it's about what logically follows from the argument. If you are a feminist, it logically follows that you should act in accordance with feminist beliefs. If you didn't, you are not a feminist, definitionally and logically speaking.

If you are an antinatalist, it is because you believe that birth is unethical. Therefore it logically follows that if you pay for births to happen, you are not an antinatalist. You could try and draw out a distinction between being against human births and non-human births, but in that case the onus is on you to name the trait difference between humans and non-humans that justifies that position."
antinatalism,fdn3j0a,t1_fdml228,1578576226.0,"Not an offensive question to ask at all. At the core of both antinatalism and veganism is the notion that it is unethical to create life that is guaranteed to suffer, especially when done so unnecessarily and for your own selfish desires. In the meat, dairy and egg industries, billions of lives are created, suffer, and die every single year, simply because people like the taste of their flesh - in other words, their selfish desires. You cannot be an antinatalist without also being vegan, because the exact same reasoning applies to both ideologies."

You just demonstrated the point I was trying to make. You are using extinction as if it is something inherently unethical, and then arguing from there. I am saying that it is not inherently unethical. Additionally, the phrase 'wiped out' has connotations with causing suffering in the process, when extinction doesn't have to involve suffering. I am arguing that we should stop breeding them. No suffering is caused to any sheep in that process, and in fact, you are reducing the suffering in the world by doing so."

facepalm,fdgu35a,t1_fdgr8c0,1578408348.0,"I don't really have an opinion on your first point. However, not breeding them in the first place would certainly fix that issue.

As to your second point, unfortunately, shearing often is done badly. Consumers want cheap products and companies want to make a profit. It only takes a few sheep farmers to shear clumsily and on a factory farming scale to undercut all other farms. Additionally, farmers are often paid by volume, not per hour, which is not a good insentive for obvious reasons. Then it becomes a matter of possible scale. The farms that throw ethical standards out of the window are simply more profitable, as we have seen in the meat, dairy and egg industries, and end up dominating the market. 

Then there is the environmental cost of wool. While there are synthetic alternatives than cause significant damage to the environment, there are some alternatives that don't. Whileever there are alternatives to wool that are less damaging to the environment, the only reason to choose wool is one of preference, which doesn't justify the harm caused by its production."
