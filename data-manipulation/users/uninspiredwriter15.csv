FanFiction,ffgpnxj,t3_etej9w,1579911885.0,I have a specific playlist for each fic. It's actually kind of a ritual for me to create a playlist after I outline my fic; I can't start the writing process until my playlist is ready.
FanFiction,ffgpjla,t3_et8d3w,1579911801.0,Congratulations!

There are lot more people in this world who are arrogant than those who have low self esteem. The probability that this was an ""I'm hot shit lol yay me"" tweet is astoundingly strong."
safe_food,fffprew,t3_ete2el,1579889144.0,"This was all from Publix, and most of it's BOGO this week! 

BOGO items: GoGo pouch 4-packs, Laughing Cow cheese, Vlasic pickles, Hidden Valley ranch (including fat free/light), Taco Bell taco sauce, raspberries.

The Noosa yogurts and Starkist creation pouches were both 10 for $10.

The carrots, cucumber, and reduced-calorie bread were all regular price (but Publix brand bread is very cheap as it is). 

I paid $73 and some change. The Starkist pouches and GoGo pouches will last me a month, and the cheese and hot sauce will probably last me a good 2-3 months. So for the next few weeks all I really have to do is stop at the store or a produce stand every 3-4 days and buy some fresh produce, and maybe another loaf of bread. Other than that, I'm all set for pretty much the next month!"

What's unbelievable is that she didn't immediately recognize her own reflection. If you don't immediately recognize your own reflection, there's something physically wrong inside your brain. So this girl is either about to have a stroke, or this never happened."
safe_food,ffesyzm,t1_ffe2h2b,1579864071.0,Cilantro avocado ranch is my personal fave but they're all great :)
safe_food,ffe0kh7,t1_ffdx67d,1579833584.0,Yes they're awesome!
safe_food,ffdvha4,t3_esinoj,1579829940.0,"Ooh is that the Starkist hot buffalo one? I had one of those for lunch today! Never thought of adding cucumber for volume, that's such a good idea"
safe_food,ffdv15b,t1_ffdpga3,1579829624.0,Even better: Bolthouse makes yogurt-based salad dressings! They taste like regular creamy salad dressing but the one I use is only 20 a tbsp
