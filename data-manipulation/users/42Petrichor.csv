AskReddit,fgkoxg3,t1_fgjmidr,1580870422.0,"Ok but to be fair, those questions are yes/no/closed questions followed by a statement, not a question. Not really the best way to initiate a conversation, especially combine with date nerves. “What made you decide to be a teacher?” “What’s the strangest thing that happened in your classroom so far?” etc

(I tend to talk too much, so closed questions work for me, but I’m working on getting others to talk more.)"

All the best to you and your kids, they’re lucky to have you (and not their mom)."

TwoXChromosomes,ffmbbq9,t1_ffjnl8g,1580051757.0,"Ask her if she feels that way. Did you ever get the idea she felt that way before you “ knew what you were?” 

Who/what you are has not changed, only your knowledge of it and I get how you feel about it. You get to feel how you feel, but so does your mom. And she clearly doesn’t hate you, clearly isn’t reminded of a terrible thing, and she sees YOU when she looks at you. And she loves YOU, no matter how you came into her life. That matters, so much."
MadeMeSmile,ffma0b8,t3_eu11ev,1580051179.0,This has me in tears. So kind and beautiful to work so hard together.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffhzm9g,t3_etl02h,1579960457.0,"Not this one. Income inequality, racism, corrupt law enforcement, messed up health care, poor education, failing infrastructure....what else, what else....oh and “leaders” who line their pockets instead of trying to improve things. 

We have some nice roads though. Some pretty places, too."

coolguides,ff2rmrp,t1_ff2a2l5,1579521058.0,"Black suits look very harsh on most people. And Black/black/black would just make you look like a goth mobster, please don’t. 

Dark solid navy is just as formal (unless it’s a white tie occasion, but navy/navy tie is fine for black tie optional), and much more versatile and flattering. And since you’ll be in the wedding, get input from the bride and groom. Have fun!"
rarepuppers,ff179jn,t3_eqyt8w,1579475965.0,Those are amazing. Well done.

TwoXChromosomes,fdp63f4,t1_fdn9e8r,1578620867.0,"He gave me his business card. I called. No pressure, clearly employed and who he said he was. Plus I could leave it on my kitchen counter with a note that said “If I disappear, start with this guy!” when I met him for our first date. 10/10 would call again, married 20 years in next month."
relationship_advice,fdmzcfy,t3_em08o5,1578572295.0,"I am so sorry for this. Please understand wanting to run away is natural, but it’s NOT what you are DOING. You are THERE, you are trying. That is all you can do. Tell your wife how you love her and I think it’s ok to let her know you are scared. She’s your partner, she wants to help you, too, and getting those fears and struggles out there between you can help you both face and decide how to handle them.

Have you asked her providers to help you find resources to support you? Do you have a “place” to run to occasionally, even if it’s the library or a movie? A friend who will listen any time? If any redditors have offered to listen/IM, take them up on it, you will get some amazing support and advice. Good luck, I’m so sorry."
