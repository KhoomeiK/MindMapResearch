I wouldn't be surprised if they had time travel anyway, as they could replicate most of the abilities of the infinity stones anyway, and even humans were able to figure it out. It might have to be a different form of time travel, though, or else all timelines just did a Loki exchange to each other's past.

After all, one Frigg didn't seem very surprised at the idea of a son from the future. In fact, she brought it up.

So, all the Odins in all timelines probably just deposited baby Lokis in adjacent ones near to when Thor was a baby and every Frigg and Odin just thought that was normal.

marvelstudios,ffsgl4f,t1_ffs9pn9,1580181203.0,"True, but they just need to be the same physical and mental age when they're whatever age they look as kids. 

I think it kind of makes sense if Loki was a small baby for a while while Thor was a preteen because that makes Thor seem less like a manchild as an adult if the ""I liked snakes!"" phase where he'd pick up random snakes happened when he was a little boy. And Loki would be a more appropriate mass to pretend to be a small snake.

Because snakes, dogs, puppy dogs tails ought to be a little boy Thor thing, not an adult Thor thing as funny as he is now.

It also means Loki developed mentally faster and could theoretically have matched his older brother's appearance agewise on his own, as part of the ""jealous of my brother, I want to show I'm better than him"" arc we're talking about.

All I know is yesterday, a trip in Manila one way when traffic was heavier took about 4 times as long as the trip it took the other way when it was later and the traffic was lighter.

It made me reframe that poorly received Jo Koy post about a police escort in Cebu cutting a 2 hour trip down into 15 minutes.

Of course, it sucks that some people get special treatment but what I noted there was... if everyone wasn't trying to diskarte around everyone else and tying up traffic further (that includes all the police escorted special people), everyone on the roads might have just taken 15-30 minutes to get to the end of their 2 hour journey. But nope, some has to cut some off, cause a domino effect of braking and traffic jams.  Someone can't wait correctly at an intersection so the other roads get jammed. 

We're literally in a hurry to get nowhere. Maybe it's time to consider if slow and steady wins the race."

Philippines,ff5ners,t3_erkj5v,1579601655.0,"I guess if it's just your family you want out of this business and you aren't trying to stop the corruption in government, you can try to invite a bigger corporate entity to steal the family's business. Then again, I don't know how you'd do that without your family being manipulated into taking on all the debt for a big project while the larger entity gets most of the profit. 

I think doing that runs a very big risk of pushing your family deeper into the project kickback business, as they'd keep attempting to recoup losses. 

At some point, no amount of money earned is enough, it's basically an addiction to seeing bigger numbers and they might be blind to when they're making a loss - which could happen if they try to get too big too fast.

If your family starts taking out loans to finance a project, it's basically on its way to losing money and being sued by a watchdog and you just have to wait. They'll probably start registering new corporate names with the SEC or something to get away from any debtors.

If a certain mango cakeshop's new owner's name is mentioned at any point, it's too late. The family's in too deep. It will be trying to dig out of debt while trying to maintain its lifestyle.

If your family takes trips to casinos, it's probably also too late.

Basically, probably the only way out is bankruptcy and ruin, and even then it's going to be a neverending attempt to get back in.

Even electing a new mayor won't work. If a family member goes into politics, the family will just have income from both ends.

They'll stop making 220,000 for every 30,000 peso project when they start counting money in millions. They'll then proceed to get too confident in the scheme and try to play with bigger, more wiley, more corrupt people. They'll get played, find out their deals were terrible for them, they'll lose money, and then they will desperately grab onto corruption even more strongly. I imagine that happens all the time. You'll know when it's another family's turn when your family's being talked about by the other wealthy people in your city/municipality as having ""lost everything"" possibly from gambling way too
much.

You'll look at your family, shake your head and wonder why they let this happen and if you could have done anything. Looks to me like you did try to do something. Is it enough? No. Is it all you can probably do? Probably.

Sorry if that was a rambling and unhelpful response. It didn't happen to my family, but I've heard/seen it happen to some others.

Insulate yourself, get a different lawyer for your own personal and business needs than your family lawyer. That lawyer might be a family friend or a family member. You want a different one for all sorts of reasons. Mostly because the family's lawyer's totally in on it."
