exmormon,fgp8p7j,t1_fgohmp3,1580999573.0,"That's good. I think there is a bit of the ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" at work with These blessings too. As a kid, if you know Heavenly Father believes in you and gave you a certain challenging situation as a test, I'm sure you approach that differently than if it just seemed like a crappy situation. I loved mine too, still do, to a point. However, I'm not convinced that Patriarchs have a hot line to God for every individual they see."
exmormon,fgoh4sy,t1_fgo4you,1580969771.0,"I don't know where you live or how high the possibility would be, but if you're truly looking to find her a counselor or a therapist, please find one that is not LDS. I have unfortunately heard negative stories about people being treated through the ""church lens"".  It could exacerbate the situation she is in, if she feels she cannot speak openly about her reasons for leaving. I'm not saying that all LDS counselors, therapists or psychiatrists would do this, but it's a risk.  For counseling to be effective, she needs to feel 100% safe and supported."
exmormon,fgoe2i3,t1_fgo8rcw,1580966908.0,"I agree. I often found that blessings given by patriarchs to people that they knew growing up got longer, much more detailed blessings. Mine's about a page and a half from a patriarch who didn't really know me. All my blessings and promises are very general and vague. It did not say I would serve a mission, though I would and said I would have children and could not. So, yeah.... When I believed, I loved it. Now, not so much."
books,fgjv6jl,t3_eymxsk,1580852017.0,OMG! I'm right there with you!
exmormon,fgflqzw,t1_fgey9m2,1580742109.0,"Do so at the right point though. Judge for yourself when she might be open to that. Too soon and she could feel as if you are talking down to her or enjoying her confusion. Remember, she's been entrenched with this for many more years than you. Proceed with caution and love."
exmormon,fgeptap,t1_fgd08nm,1580705967.0,"This is my thought exactly. How does one lead with  revelations that they are NOT getting? Visions not seen? You either lie to others that you have received word of God or you share your own thoughts as if they were such.  Either way, even if they mean well, they realize they are not who they claim to be, but it's all about the show."
AmItheAsshole,fg8r1tv,t3_exesyn,1580628332.0,YTA. You KNOW this isn't a bridesmaid-ish dress. You know it but didn't want to be bothered. You took advantage of how flexible she's been to take the easy way out.
exmormon,fg89ema,t1_fg704tv,1580613080.0,"Ah damnit, I'm slow. 

I've not attended church since 2003, lived with my boyfriend for 11 years, enjoy wine, a well made gin and tonic and occasional marijuana edible.  I put 10% into my 401k (instead of tithing ) and I STILL sometimes say ""we"" if I'm referencing my past with TSCC. I've got to stop that!"
exmormon,fg81p13,t1_fg73exx,1580607159.0,"Good point, I've never thought about it that way."
exmormon,fg7x5b5,t1_fg6xil7,1580603729.0,"Oh, oh my. I suddenly feel a tad more grateful to have grown up as female. Though I suppose our sexual analogy was chewed gum. So really, there were no winners in the sex talks by ecclesiastical Leaders."
exmormon,fg7cnje,t3_ewwjke,1580589306.0,Oh....oh my. That's a horrifying talk.
exmormon,fg6bzyk,t1_fg5lafj,1580563144.0,"Clue me in... What's the ""little factories talk?"""
exmormon,fg6bgs5,t1_fg5xqmx,1580562566.0,I remember hearing things like that. What a load of crap!
exmormon,fg69vpb,t3_ex0mhb,1580560729.0,Exactly!

Damn hospital security. So what is Reddit etiquette? Do I edit or do I leave it?"
MurderedByWords,fg5ozq1,t1_fg5i4nx,1580533797.0,"I remember the first time I saw a chicken grab a nurse and kill it.... I was dumbfounded! Increased my respect for chickens, that's for sure."
AmItheAsshole,fg5b507,t1_fg3vp4q,1580522877.0,"Also, there is a certain level of increased intimacy when you are cooking dinner for someone in your own home. If they were going out to dinner and going to be in public that would be one thing. The fact that they are in his home is absolutely not appropriate. If she can't see that I am sorry for you"
exmormon,fg0zd6v,t3_ew6zb4,1580417971.0,"And you know, I was so brainwashed, it never even dawned on me with all of the General Conferences I watched that a woman never ever gave the prayer. Blinded, just blinded."

exmormon,fg0mjbb,t1_fg0atyl,1580410787.0,"^^ This. My grandfather passed away when I was 14. In the back of my mind I had this idea that he could be ever present at this large bank of video screens. I figured it was like something you see in a NASA control room. Even worse, that he would be made to stand there and face the embarrassment and ridicule from others if I masturbated, lied or sinned in any way. It was horrible and while I outgrew that (even while still in TSCC) it was an emotional mind screw for a kid."
AmItheAsshole,ffzp23n,t3_evst9l,1580388586.0,"My parents rule was.... No payment for next semester until we see grades from previous semester.  Also... When I started getting pell grants and passing more of own way, they didn't care about grades so much."
AmItheAsshole,ffzo1ww,t3_ew1spd,1580387611.0,LED and battery operated candles are amazing. Some are insanely realistic. My bf is an ex firefighter... I had to give up open flame when we moved in together. This is our compromise.
exmormon,ffze3eq,t3_evtvhk,1580374430.0,"I cannot imagine the pain that comes with separation from the one that you love. A separation caused not because of lies or actions on your behalf and not because of lies or actions on their behalf but because of the horrible untruths of a third party that was so ingrained in both of your lives. I am so sorry for the pain you are going through, but there is absolutely truly life after this."
exmormon,ffzdjxt,t3_evxj5f,1580373663.0,"Damn, all this time it's been Cracker Jack's subtle tattoo prizes ruining the youth of America. Caramel popcorn leading all children astray with evil designs on an inked world."
