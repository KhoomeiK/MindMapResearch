trees,fgmdzav,t1_fgmc5nh,1580922694.0,"Definitely agree with you there. People are too flippant about it all and believe it’s just “healthy.” Relatively speaking (to tobacco or alcohol), it certainly is better, but there are still harms that everyone should be aware of. 

Sorry I missed the tobacco control— there’s a very plausible connection but one that is too contradicted to be clear in either direction. 

I think both are a result of the government-imposed stigma and illegalization:

1- It blockaded the research that could tell hs more conclusively one way or the other (which is vitally necessary!)

2- It imposed a serious skepticism of anti-weed news — scientific or otherwise — when so much was literally propaganda."
trees,fgmac04,t1_fgm82bs,1580920862.0,"That study associates cancer development with self-responded questionnaires of hospital patients. It makes no significant effort to control for the *many* potential variables that could cause this *8%* increase in development among those who have reported marijuana use (in unreported quantities). 

Among these would be likelihood of smoking cigarettes or tobacco as well, the method of consumption (idiots using tin cans or even just bad papers for rolling) which is high amongst cannabis users. 

This is not to say there can’t be a correlation between lung/throat cancer and marijuana smoke, but there **certainly is not sufficient evidence to claim a connection.** In fact, the best, long-run and controlled studies on the subject show no correlation at all (leading some experts to theorize that marijuana actively combats cancer development to a greater extent than its smoke could cause it).

Again, this doesn’t mean there aren’t health consequences. [There are many](https://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/marijuana-and-lung-health.html), but to claim that one of those is cancer is unsubstantiated at this time (potentially due to insufficient study, but also potentially because there isn’t one)."

TumblrInAction,fg5thjd,t1_fg5pdks,1580538274.0,"It’s “bi” as in “two” and “sexual” as in “sexualities.”

Those “two sexualities”? They’re “homosexual” and in “same,” and “heterosexual” as in “other.”

So “bisexual” = *attracted to the same gender* **and** *other genders*. 

It’s right in the word, and at the end of the day it’s about how people identify and who they are — there is more than one interpretation for a given word, and language is just used to communicate knowledge at the end of the day."

AskMen,ffphnrs,t1_ffpa7s4,1580095283.0,"The difference between “legitimate sexuality” and “mental illness” is extremely varied and societal in nature, really. 

Until 1973, the [American Psychological Association officially classified homosexuality as a mental illness](https://www.hrc.org/blog/flashbackfriday-today-in-1973-the-apa-removed-homosexuality-from-list-of-me). Today, that would be homophobic and unacceptable (though still the view of many). 

Transsexuality (which I believe you’re alluding to) is an even better example. It’s still bridged with “Gender Dysmorphia” as a mental illness, but accepted also as a legitimate scientific condition. It’s entirely up to society if we decide transitioning one gender to another to “match” what’s inside you (what science seems to agree *actually is inside them*) is acceptable and right or enabling of illness and wrong! 

We can certainly call pedophilia a mental illness if we want, but it may do more harm than good. I’d say that calling it a “mental illness” may be problematic in that (1) It’s possible that no sexual attraction should be deemed such, as it makes it easier to call any that, and (2) It may alienate pedophiles from seeking psychological care and support necessary to alleviate desires and prevent action. This may be me reading too much into the other person’s comment, however! 

I also think pedophilia should be recognized as a legitimate medical condition not in the control of the person, and, ideally, that they be accepted enough to allow them to find help without being alienated (which can lead to acting on their desires... the worst case scenario!). 

I’m not an expert, but I’ve had this conversation a few times now and this is more or less the consensus we came to then. Always happy to debate and think about this more though— **for questions like these, I’m just most interested in preventing harm as much as possible (for as many as possible)!**"

AskMen,ffp4cvn,t1_ffp2k2c,1580085928.0,"Agreed... the thought is crazy. 

I put it in perspective by asking “Does it matter?” Pedophilia is an sexual attraction— one formed the same way any other attraction is, by genetics or upbringing. Do I care that they have that attraction? No. Do I care if they act on it? Hell fucking yes I do. 

It’s the same way I think about many kinks. A huge percentage of the population is in to BDSM, many even into forced/rape fantasy. They’re more than welcome to their attractions and, fundamentally, can’t really change them. 

Again, it’s only okay so long as they don’t act in a way that would ever harm someone (seeking consent for BDSM, practicing fantasy with 18+ for pedophilia, etc), but it exists regardless."

changemyview,ffnogbx,t1_ffmr48l,1580068550.0,"The idea that religious beliefs “aren’t policies or theories that can be reformed or changed” is absolutely incorrect. Every religion has changed over time to adapt to circumstance and/or desire — [even orthodox and ultra orthodox Judaism ](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/orthodox-judaism-is-changing/). 

Most religions change regularly because they are simply a reflection of those who follow them. This can be “cultural” as the Protestant Revolution and drastic changes made by new Popes, or [“textual/literal” like the theological evolution and eventual invention of the Holy Trinity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#ProNicCon).

Also, your “democracy” analogy is flawed because you’re talking about different things. Popular Democracy is exactly what you described as “theoretical” — a plurality rules; Representative Democracy is what you describe as “actual” — a few are elected to make the rules. Both are man-made concepts, and their execution depends entirely on the will of those implementing them. It’s actually a better demonstration of how fabricated and mailable all religion must be."
