nextfuckinglevel,fglk6hc,t1_fgl9g3r,1580901763.0,I had the same thing done but with a different tooth and yes it is incredibly painful. I think my Mum would murder me if I lost my retainers
nextfuckinglevel,fglk18a,t1_fgkwtvu,1580901579.0,I had the same thing done but with a different tooth and it took about 3 and a half years. Every second was torture.
cats,fgljmg7,t3_ez1hci,1580901063.0,"Good bye Olive. I hope you have a fun time up in heaven with my baby Tommy and all the other furbabies that have passed.

Sorry for your loss. It's the worse thing when they pass away unexpectedly :("
POTS,fglj8mj,t1_fglainr,1580900537.0,"That's okay! And yes you're right, it certainly does make it very frustrating."
POTS,fgl6cr3,t3_ez4vvm,1580883535.0,"Sorry, I don't have an answer on how to cure it, but just so you know you're not alone. I'm studying at Uni and this happens all the time. It can make study really difficult."

POTS,fgkjqah,t1_fgkicnj,1580867160.0,"Thank you. I can't remember the name, and I do feel as though it has helped, just not heaps. Best of luck to you as well :-)"
POTS,fgki4da,t1_fgkhgny,1580866094.0,Damn that's a shame. Well I wish you all the best!
POTS,fgkhryx,t1_fgiwss3,1580865866.0,Fair enough. I'm thinking about doing the same.
POTS,fgkhpcj,t1_fgi8y87,1580865818.0,"A similar thing has happened to me, except I haven't gotten anemic thankfully. My iron just gets really low, and I can't handle oral iron either. I had an iron infusion recently and was hoping that it would help a little with my symptoms.

I'm sorry you've had to go through all this, and I wish you good luck! Thank you for responding."
POTS,fgkha80,t1_fgkgz53,1580865541.0,I'm sorry that happened to you. Is there any way you can talk to the manager or owner of the establishment so you can feel safer there?

POTS,fgi6vb4,t1_fghvcyd,1580808645.0,"I'm thinking about doing the same thing, especially since I'm starting University soon. I certainly don't want to be fainting at Uni!"
POTS,fgi6sdb,t1_fghga1d,1580808518.0,"That's smart. I too get low iron after each period, but not thankfully not anemia."
POTS,fgi6qch,t1_fghdi2t,1580808428.0,"Even with an IUD it's bad? That's crazy. I don't know much about birth control, but I'd thought that they would at least help reduce the symptoms. It was probably just wishful thinking!"
ehlersdanlos,fghckvr,t3_eygkgk,1580781823.0,That's really pretty!
POTS,fghbznr,t1_fghbu0h,1580781444.0,"That's understandable, they really are nightmares just by themselves, but add POTS into the mix? It's terrible."
POTS,fghbseu,t1_fghbh0e,1580781313.0,"I experience the same thing, and faint more often too. When I'm not on my period it's rare that I faint, but when I am I have to be constantly careful because I faint more often. 

I think I'll start taking salt tablets when I've got my period. I can't stand them but hopefully it will help reduce my symptoms a little. Thanks for sharing, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one."

Make sure you consult a pharmacist too, and if strange symptoms that aren't on the side effects list, or if the side effects are more intense than what they should be, consult your doctor."

The time for me to choose my courses is drawing nearer, and I was wondering, do you think I'll have better chances getting into the Humanitarian industry if I study Sociology and International Aid and Development or Teaching and International Aid and Development?

Thanks :-)"
