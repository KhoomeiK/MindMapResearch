The complaint is that itâ€™s a four door crossover and therefor not a Mustang.  Ps many of us would love to see an electric Mustang but now we canâ€™t because the electric â€œMustangâ€ is a fucking soccer mom car.
MustangMachE,fdls5ys,t3_dzua0x,1578531215.0,OP is dead on.  Incredibly stupid move by Ford.  But this is the wrong subreddit for this take.  This subreddit is entirely controlled by Ford and its sole purpose is to whitewash the backlash theyâ€™ve engendered with this stupid move.

Youâ€™re very unlikely to see a Marine in Afghanistan haul a civilian out if his car and shoot him just because the guy isnâ€™t cooperating.  

Ps yes some of the cops who have pulled stupid shit are ex-military but the difference is that they are no longer led buy competent officers providing coherent orders."
