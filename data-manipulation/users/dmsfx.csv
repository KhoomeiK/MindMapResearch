You’re acting like having glass in a render is some sort of cheat when it adds quite a bit of overhead in terms of ray bounces and getting the right combo of roughness and albedo and getting the refracted light to be occluded by dust and such can be a challenge. Your materials don’t look like you have any maps at all, just a shader with metalness maxed out."

The guy’s friend gave very emotional interviews about him. The detective could barely make it through some parts. The 2 who initially started the hunt didn’t cry but hey flat out stated that by the time it escalated to murder they were both in fear for their own lives and pissed off that their numerous attempts to alert police had been ignored. They’d tracked the asshole down and the cops just missed him. But the attitude that “it was just some animals” and the lack any sort of hard animal cruelty law for them to enforce meant they just didn’t follow up and forgot about him. If people had cared a bit more about the animals he killed the guy he murdered might still be alive.

Cinema4D,ffeg8cs,t3_et1k6d,1579846805.0,"The setup you would use depends on the case and what you want to do and the limitations of the software. It’s been a while since I used C4D so I’m not sure where it’s at in terms of these approaches.

1 approach would be to use textures. You need to have UVs for the 2D textures to project on the 3D geometry. But there’s a lot you can do with it. Textures. In your example you’d just make a set of images that has the metal circle and a green color around that. Textures can control a lot of different things. For instance you can have float textures that are just black and white and control opacity, roughness, metalness, ambient occlusion, curvature, etc. you can also have vector textures with red green and blue values that control color, normal, displacement etc. you might watch a few videos on substance designer to get an idea of what texture maps can do. The limitations of them are that they don’t work great with things that require space inside an object even though you can have a thickness map.

Refraction and subsurface scattering really work best with some geometry. A window thats 5mm thick will refract light correctly whereas a single polygon with the same shader will not. For that You can use a geometric approach and have 2 separate objects with their own materials. You can also do as you mentioned and cut a circle into the plane and apply the textures directly to the geometry. The difficulty here is deformation. If you want it to behave like a cloth you could put 2 objects into a group or a null and apply the deformation to that, but if you want it to behave like cloth it really needs to be 1 object. 

If you cut a circle into a plane you’re going to run into issues with geometry and deformation when you try to make it behave like cloth. The ideal plane for this would have lots of regularly divisions and be all 4-sided polygons but creating a circle in the middle will make a topology problem where you’ll have to cut the rest up so that the grid of the plane joins up with the circle without creating triangles or N-gons.

For this example I’d recommend a texture approach. Just let it be a nice deformable grid and let the textures handle the gold and foliage appearance."
Ubuntu,ffcwex1,t1_ffcrg5q,1579808675.0,"I used to swear by Lenovo. I had been a Dell certified tech in college and repaired the laptops they gave out to students as part of a program. They were high-end machines too, latitudes, not consumer grade stuff. They were pretty mediocre then. Mostly the screen hinges just wore down to the point the screens flopped around within about 2 years but the program replaced students’ machines every 2 years so it was just after graduation that they’d be screwed. I bought a Lenovo in 2011 and it still runs like a champ but Lenovo’s taken a nose dive in recent years. The CCP isn’t interested in keeping up the IBM quality standard so now they’re just the Huawei of laptops. 

My experience with Dell today tells me their support isn’t worth shit and their “premium” hardware is designed to fail and force upgrades even worse than Apple.

Houdini,ff98of9,t3_es6s2g,1579707406.0,"I like C4D, and got more done with that than probably any other package. I wanted to do more video game asset stuff though and C4d’s topology and UV tools just really weren’t up to the task. I still find if a lot faster for motion graphics stuff.

I worked with maya and zbrush for a couple years. I appreciate their power but ffs, working with maya feels like peeling a potato with a hammer and zbrush feels like writing a term paper in Microsoft paint. Why make me delete the node history constantly!? Why not auto-resolve overlapping faces or cancel the operation when I accidentally hit the extrude option in the marking menu? Why did it take so long to get basic duplicate/transform tools that show you a real-time preview of the operation?

I was working on a model one day about a year ago and it was like the 50th time that Maya did that thing where selections suddenly stop working as expected. I’d click a face and it would select a different face somewhere else on the mesh. The only solution I’d found for that was to copy all the geometry and paste it into a new file. I decided to not do that again. Blender, 3ds max, , mood, something, anything. I’d had it with Maya.

I had been watching a talk by Andrew Price where he was discussing AI and 3D and showed some of the procedural models that Houdini users had created. So I decided to give it a try and never looked back. Everything made so much sense. And SideFX support has been incredible."

blackmagicdesign,feh9dgv,t3_eoze9o,1579111863.0,"Just my general experience with a few different setups commuting between the US and Asia for 3 years:

eGPU: it’s a great option to have on a desk at home to get decent performance out of a thin& light laptop. It’s not great for traveling. The cage and power supply just take chunk of that checked bag weight limit and you still need an external display to really get the most use out of it. Sending video back to the laptop display really eats into the thunderbolt 3 bandwidth and some laptops don’t even allow you to use the built in display. Another thing to keep in mind is power consumption. If you’re going macOS your only option is AMD but their desktop GPU’s generally have higher power consumption than the Nvidia equivalent. More power = bigger PSU = bigger enclosure & more weight. Blackmagic has their own AMD eGPU that’s decently small and light but I don’t think you can change GPU’s and I’m not sure that it works with windows. Also, keep in mind thunderbolt cables can’t be very long by necessity and the cables you usually get with an enclosure are about 30cm.

As for GPU choice I think that depends on what you’re going to be doing with it. AMD has lots of raw power and generally comes in cheaper than Nvidia, but you don’t get some of the real-time rendering features like RTX and the optix denoiser if you’re doing 3D, which can cut render time quite a bit when used properly. 

Format matters as much as hardware. I have a big 24 core, dual RTX 2080 super windows/Linux workstation and it can even get bogged down on an 4K exr sequence. H.264 drops frames, but if you render to a proper workflow format it edits in 4K at real time.

My laptop of choice after 3 years trying different things: MacBook Pro w/ final cut. I am really sick of Apple but for being fully mobile and traveling the final cut optimization is just really hard to beat. Don’t bother with the most expensive CPU though, macOS throttles the CPU hard due to thermals so you only get the advertised speed in bursts. It won’t sustain that speed for renders."

Another big issue is the SSD. 128 just isn’t very much, even for HD. You’re going to be editing from an external drive for the most part, which will be extremely slow. You’d probably spend almost as much on an external ssd as you spent on the chrome book itself and it will still be a bottleneck."

1. A private insurer legally required to extract profit for it's shareholders, is not the same thing as a government entity like Medicare. The entire purpose for a government body like the NHS in the UK or Medicare in the US is to serve a function that capitalism sucks at. The fantasy that government organizations can Or should act like a profit-driven entity is, frankly, retarded. 

2. The transaction is between the patient and the doctor/hospital/healthcare provider. Adding another layer of profit to that transaction, aka a private insurer, is NEVER going to make that transaction cheaper. The fact that paying monthly for insurance, plus the premium and co-pays and everything else is cheaper than going to the hospital on your own is FUCKED UP. The only purpose of insurance is to distribute cost over time and profit on providing financial cushion as a service. 

3. Profit driven healthcare is fucked up because the capitalist system doesn't work for everything. In this case it's at odds with basic human decency. Capitalism requires choice. In this case, a patient has no choice. Uninsured patients are either going to pay now, go into crippling debt, or die. Insured patients have the choice of a huge insurance bill they can't afford every month or risk ending up in the uninsured person's position. Every law we have enacted to protect human decency that isn't ""make Medicare and Medicaid the US version of the NHS"" just fucks that system up even worse so that now insurers pay a reasonable, informed and negotiated rate, while uninsured pay the bills for all of the people who couldn't pay but the hospital was legally required to treat. 

It doesn't work. It hasn't worked for the, what, 70 years we've been dicking around pretending it could work, ignoring the fact that every other developed country has some sort of NHS and has healthier, longer-living people."
