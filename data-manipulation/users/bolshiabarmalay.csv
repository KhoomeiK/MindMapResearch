It was intended to reduce bikes getting rear ended at intersections by distracted drivers. It’s a stepping stone to full splitting and helps riders and drivers get used to the notion. 

The rules are: only applies to two lane or more city streets with speed limit 45 mph or lower, traffic stopped, filtering bike limited to 15 mph. 

Once everybody is comfortable with it I think they’ll broaden it to all roads (freeways)"
