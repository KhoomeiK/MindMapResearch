AskReddit,fcw1u8d,t1_fcv3l4u,1578015196.0,"It tough work, but I love it. I have gotten to a position however where I do a lot of design work compared to some of my friends from grad school. It's a long road but if I had a chance to start over, i would do the exact same thing. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions you have.

Edit: I want to be clear, I am not designing high-rises, city Halls or the next high tech library that will end up on the cover of a magazine..  So regardless of what my kids think, I am not the world's best designer/ Architect , I am   not the worse however. I do know that I love practicing as an architect much more than I enjoyed school and especially studio."
