But it didn’t come without a lot of work and change on my part—quitting my soul-sucking job, deciding to get serious about meditating every day, deciding to put aside my cynicism and self-protective nature surrounding my depression and to be vulnerable about it with those I trusted in a support group.

depression,ffd1l2y,t3_esy7sx,1579811613.0,"I think moving out to a place with more trees and getting a dog sounds like a lovely goal. It also sounds like you’re taking care of your body and paying off your debt, doing the things you need to do to make that goal happen. It’s hard for humans to be in a purgatory state—especially those of us who struggle with depression. The temptation to say “what’s the point of it all” and rattle the bars instead of moving calmly toward our goals is strong. Maybe you could talk with your therapist about setting small goals, or perhaps switching therapists if you’re not vibing with this one. When you’re in a holding pattern, having small things every day that make you feel good is essential. It sounds like the gym is one of those things. Maybe exploring, learning about, and dreaming about where you’d like to move could be another, or volunteering at an animal shelter. I’m in a similar holding pattern myself, and it can be agonizing at times. Sending you all the positive vibes!"

A lot of the therapy “work” and the beauty of the process happens out of the office. If so, are you trying your best to work toward these small goals? 2) Is this the right therapist for you? Sometimes switching the therapy style or even gender of your therapist can help. 3) If you’re in bed all day, it sounds like you need a psychiatrist as well, and maybe medicine to give you a jump start. Therapy and medicine work quite well together, but in cases of moderate to severe depression, rarely work well on their own."

Try to open up to someone you trust, or else these feelings will continue to build and come out in more negative, potentially nihilistic ways. As Sarah Silverman wisely put it, and I'll paraphrase, you have to deal with your shit or your shit deals with you. This is not a tough love statement, only gentle encouragement to find an outlet for these feelings, whether through a new friend, hobby, loved one, or therapist. If you have to wait it out due to your living situation, meditation can really help. If you haven't done it before, the headspace app is a great place to start."

depression,ff33qa5,t3_erdazj,1579532904.0,"My childhood (and adult) depression often manifested as irritability or anger, to friends or partners. That was what was so confusing about it—I didn’t have signs of depression people often look for, like sleeping too much, not meeting deadlines at work, or missing social activities. I was “high functioning”. I was checking all the boxes. But there was pure emptiness inside of me.  And when I couldn’t fill that, I got irritated. Like you, I didn’t want to be touched. My parents had no idea that this was depression in the 80s, when mental health was seldom talked about. It took me 33 years to get help from a great psychiatrist, and I’m so glad I did. 

tl;dr Depression can manifest as irritability and numbness. It can look “high functioning.” Getting dismissed for these feelings as a child means it might be even more important to get them validated and evaluated by a therapist and/or psychiatrist now."
depression,ff32p4u,t3_ercrg0,1579532123.0,"My advice: 1) Let it out. All of it. Every last tear. Don’t let anyone tell you you’re being weak, but do allow someone to comfort you if they are okay sitting with you while you cry. 2) See a therapist and psychiatrist as soon as you can. Crying that’s hard to control is actually good in my experience, because you’re moving through processing a depressed episode instead of just being numb.

There are some good countdown apps out there. Every time you have a dark thought you can check to see how many days are left on your contract. That should provide some temporary relief. With that small wisp of temporary relief maybe you can do some self care or begin a meditation practice. I don't know what the therapists are like on base, but maybe you could consult with one of them as well. My heart goes out to you man, I hope you find a way to finish your contract and begin enjoying life again, and maybe find some loopholes to enjoy it a little bit in the meantime.

Just being around people stimulates happy hormones like dopamine and oxytocin that help you feel better, but that's super hard to get when you can barely leave the house. When I felt like this, I started by going to a therapist every week, and sort of re-learning how to interact. I tried to have short conversations with people every day, whether it was the cashier at the place I got my lunch sandwich or the pharmacist when I went to pick up my medicine. I joined a meditation group that I went to every week that didn't require a lot of conversation but did give me the support of a community. This kept me in practice interacting with others and gave me little boosts while I was still very depressed and waiting for my medicine to work. When medicine and therapy were finally working well I was able to move, start a new life, make new friends and rekindle old friendships, and begin dating again. But I'll never forget those little interactions I had at the beginning that kept me alive day to day."
