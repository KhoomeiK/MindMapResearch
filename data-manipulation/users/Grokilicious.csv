Re: the OP, reaching back into history to blame current choices is, in most cases, a weak argument and in many cases it's even racist. 

Sometimes choices are crap, that's true, but plenty of people have stood on principle in those circumstances."

worldnews,ffeasxc,t1_ffeaclp,1579841539.0,"The premise of my argument is that quality of life is on a significant downward curve due to climate change regardless of our corrective measures. I.e., the horse has left the gate.

You offered up a paper on carbon taxes.

Ok, I like market-based mechanisms but they won't matter at all to the millions of poor people that are living in coastal regions and flood plains, for example. We are in for a long rough ride and people must, must, must recognize that we can't do this and live cushy lives (unless one is wealthy then, well, congratulations). Quality of life reduction is a cost of clean up.

If I misunderstood your intent, apologies."
worldnews,ffe9wrh,t1_ffe38l4,1579840761.0,"Lol...you really think climate change is not going to hurt people in Bangladesh or Micronesia or Miami? What planet are you living on? Use all the tech you want to -- most people in the world can't afford it. Yes we need to implement corrective measure but they are not going to make life better. They will only stop or slow the decline. 

"" QoL goes up relative to business-as-usual if we tax carbon."" Yeah, no shit, but if you're on a downward curve you stay on that downward curve.

If you care about this, and you seem to, please stop being a dilettante. We need pragmatic people in the fight."
worldnews,ffdwhfo,t1_ffdtb7k,1579830648.0,"Read it and many others before. My comment is not about social welfare -- it's about quality of life. To correct the problem of climate change will require 2-3 generations of massive change to conventional living practices. 

Try thinking about this from first principles. 

Write out the solutions to the problem -- a complete overhaul to to the system and the environment.

Write down the costs, both in terms of money required but also changes to business processes (including agriculture and materials).

Then think about how markets and business will react to the ongoing awareness (and the increased manifestation of climate change).

Fuel will be prohibitively expensive for many for all but necessary travel. That includes electric cars until storage/battery prices lower dramatically (but even then the mining etc of inputs for those will have to be taxed).

The food choices available now will change due to seasonality and shipping, crop choices, etc.

You like hamburgers? What do you think will happen to beef prices? Let's hope synthetic meat is real and on its way?

Home ownership? Only for the very rich. Even if you can afford one in a low impact zone, will insurance exist?

A country has resources? Another country needs them. Trade or war? Are we going to stop them? What does that mean for the citizens of those countries. 

Over time new technology, etc., will smooth some of this out but for most people in the world -- if we really tackle climate change -- quality of life will degrade materially before new tech etc responds. We're already seeing that in economic terms between generations -- it's not going to get better."
worldnews,ffdq8z4,t1_ffcvrf6,1579826347.0,"Given all of the evidence of the impending disaster, what are insurance companies doing? How are they pricing the cost? They are the most sophisticated and conservative financial people assessing climate change impact. 

The answer is they are. And it is going to make certain insurances unavailable to many lower and middle class buyers.

Companies will respond to this -- be prepared for price changes.

For example, a government response will be a fuel price surcharge. Gasoline could end up costing $10 per gallon at the pump. That will reduce carbon. It will have some other effects as well.

Interesting times ahead. When the policies and market practices that will make a difference do come, one thing is for certain: quality of life will change dramatically for many."
