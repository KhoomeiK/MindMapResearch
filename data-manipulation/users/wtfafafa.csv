NoStupidQuestions,fdgc6mg,t1_fdfscwr,1578389620.0,"This was one of my first (half serious) thoughts, too. Like, probably not, but OP please look around that area in your bedroom really well just to be 100% safe. I'd also do the thing where you point your phone's camera around in the dark to detect a camera lens."

Coffee,fddijdc,t3_ejh9np,1578313690.0,"Is using whole beans and a grinder worth it even if you're just buying the cheapest of both? I use pretty cheap pre-ground right now, and I've considered starting to buy whole beans and grind them, but I can't afford much more than the cheapest stuff. Would it still be worth it, or no?"

offmychest,fcyyuzp,t1_fcydtka,1578090122.0,"I'm guessing that OP might be meaning that 70-80% includes people who aren't literally physically forced to be there, but *have* been manipulated, are in an abusive situation (even if it wasn't kidnapping), or are so desperate for money or whatever that it's an ""I literally would never want/choose to do this in my life, but it was offered to me and I need to pay rent/survive,"" type of situation. There's also the possibility of women being lied to, like being told if they do this it'll eventually get them somewhere in some industry (like modeling), when they're desperate or naive - even if they aren't actually kidnapped, when you're being manipulated to that level it's hardly doing it of your own free will."
offmychest,fcx642g,t1_fcx4px7,1578052794.0,"Really?

Edit: Why am I getting down voted? A. After OP telling that whole, obviously very personal, story, *that's* what you have to say? and B. Someone says they've struggled with addiction and been to rehab and you think it's a good idea to immediately ask this?"
changemyview,fcwvgmh,t3_ej3zca,1578039295.0,"I'm completely pro-choice, but your argument doesn't really work.

Yes, you could refuse to give the guy blood and not be charged for it, but you'd be charged for shooting him. If we're trying to make parallels here, you wouldn't be charged for not grabbing the fetus and trying to revive it *after* the abortion or something like that, you'd be charged for the abortion itself (if abortions are banned/illegal). Either the person getting the abortion, for deciding to do it and going in and having the abortion, and/or the doctor, for performing it.

People who believe abortions are immoral and that life begins at conception think of abortion as murdering a person. No matter what, the ""murder"" is happening, and the person getting the abortion (plus the one performing it) are ""responsible"" for the ""murder."""
answers,fcpr9lr,t3_eidcgz,1577870414.0,"Search to see if there's a community mental health center in your area (google ""mental health center \[city or county\]""). You might be able to get free therapy, or at least something on a sliding scale. Fees can go pretty low, a while back I went to one in my area where I only had to pay $10 per appointment. You might also try the [NAMI HelpLine](https://nami.org/Find-Support/NAMI-HelpLine). Would you by chance qualify for Medicaid? That's also an option, although it might take a little while to get approved.

I'm sorry to hear you're struggling, but glad you're looking for help."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fce5z5t,t3_egyn65,1577617209.0,"Just think, in that city of over 2 million people you live in, it's likely 1 million+ other people have hsv1 just like you do (statistics I've read vary, but it's safe to say at least 50% of adults have it.) No STD makes someone a bad person or has any bearing on their character, of course, but know that on top of that yours is far from rare. If by some chance he did tell any of his friends and they judged you, it'd be especially absurd to judge for something you have in common with at least half the population. All those people you see walking around you, surely they're just fine people who deserve love like anyone, right? Well, so are you, 100%.

His choice was just his choice, it doesn't reflect on who you are as a person."
