bipolar,ff6qx0u,t3_ervdes,1579633012.0,"I have severe bipolar I with psychosis. I spent a year refusing medicine and was in and out of hospitals and reality, lost my job, moved in with my mom. I kept not taking meds because I was in denial and because they had horrible side effects, but I eventually worked hard with my doctor to find meds that work for me. I've now been symptom free for almost three years. If you are happy, healthy, and functioning without meds, good for you. If you're not, do the work to find meds that work for you. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I don't think that's the case. I went through a lot of med changes and dose changes to get me to a healthy place where I can hold down a job and function on my own. I don't relate with a lot of the posts on this sub. I don't get it. Just take your meds. Or maybe I am really just lucky."

bipolar,ff509ni,t3_erj3a7,1579576780.0,"I have Bipolar I with psychosis. I worked with my psychiatrist to find meds that work for me. I now stick to those meds religiously. I stick to the same schedule with good sleep hygiene every single day. No matter what I go to bed around 10 and set my alarm for 8 am. That's a ridiculous amount of sleep, but that's how much I seem to need to not feel like death in the morning. Alcohol doesn't bother me, but weed sends me straight into psychosis so I don't ever do it anymore. Everyone is different, but I thrive on a good routine with proper meds."

bipolar,feiy680,t3_epcs9l,1579150502.0,"Bipolar disorder is considered a disability, but that doesn't mean you can't also be a healthy person with proper management. Counselors can't diagnose and they aren't experts in psychiatric disorders. My counselor said she believes depression is caused by environment. I corrected her, it's a genetic disorder with an environmental component. I still see her because she has a lot to offer me in other areas, but I refer to my psychiatrist and doctors for medical advice and information"

It's not her full time gig, so I think she undervalues herself"
