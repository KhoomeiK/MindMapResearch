badlinguistics,ffniu5l,t3_eubaka,1580066477.0,"So, I'm ignoring the ""sounds silly"", ""sounds like a drunk person wiping their butt with flowers"" and other such comments, because those are just (kinda mean-seeming) opinions about personal perceptions of language.

The OP of the linked comment talks about ""dumbing [Afrikaans] down"" for Dutch-speakers, and claims that Afrikaans is ""Dutch done right"", by fixing ""all the terrible grammar rules"" and ""not pronouncing English words as dutch but inventing new Afrikaans words"".

The big issue here is with claiming that one language is better than another, as well as a possibly problematic issue of what they mean by ""pure"".

Afrikaans underwent grammatical and phonological changes, innovating in some ways from the earlier modern Dutch it is descended from, but expressing things differently is not ""fixing all the terrible grammar rules""; change is change, and that Dutch has retained some more complexity in some aspects of grammar doesn't make Dutch worse.

This is not to say that Afrikaans is instead worse than Dutch or less Dutch than Dutch. Both languages have borrowed from other languages, though Afrikaans does have quite a few loanwords from languages it has been in contact with in southern Africa (though watching Flemish TV, I hear a whole lot of ""Mercis"" and ""ça vas"", and let's not forget that alstublieft(NL)/asseblief(AF) (Eng: please) is a calque from French). Both languages are descended from an older Dutch, and have gone their own ways since. That we call one Dutch and the other descended from Dutch is more due to to cultural reasons than anything to do with purity/primogeniture from earlier modern Dutch, just as both are just as genetically Germanic or Indo-European as each other; we just kept calling one emerging branch ""Dutch"" and called the other ""Afrikaans"". Had the early Boers been magically transported to another planet, they'd probably say they spoke Dutch, since they wouldn't have had to specify ""African Dutch"" as changes occurred.

So, basically, neither Afrikaans nor Dutch are more ""done right"", grammar is not ""terrible"", and Afrikaans is not ""more pure"" than Dutch."
