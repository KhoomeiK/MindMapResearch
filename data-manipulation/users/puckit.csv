todayilearned,ff52e4l,t1_ff4f85g,1579578366.0,"I was convinced that fainting wasn't even real until my second child was born. While my wife was in labor, I was standing next to her and my legs slowly started getting weak. Then my vision started getting blurry and I just felt disoriented. Once I realized I was about to faint, I took a seat for a minute and was fine. It was one of the stranger sensations I've ever felt."

movies,fevg8ro,t1_fevdhop,1579396987.0,Atta boy. Way to not get drawn in a ridiculous argument.
movies,fesg2nf,t1_fes05dn,1579364814.0,I've never heard of it. I initially thought the title of this post was riddled with typos.
pics,fepgl5o,t3_eqaiaj,1579319967.0,"What's funny to me is that this is the biggest backlash against her that I've ever seen on Reddit.

She has publicly advised a woman to get pregnant against her husband's wishes, shared medical info about Redman's wife after the family explicitly said they want privacy and admitted to blowing her husband in front of her son. But this is the scandal that makes the biggest waves."

AskReddit,feloyhz,t1_fek5p2w,1579227404.0,One of the longest running arguments between a friend and I is whether it's ok to watch sports delayed. I just can't do it. I'll DVR everything else but I just can't watch sports unless it's live. I'd rather get score updates on my phone than watch it after the get is already over.
nextfuckinglevel,fell44x,t3_epkysx,1579224772.0,Seems like a nice dude but I still want Nick Bosa to drive him repeatedly into the ground this weekend.

It doesn't need to be anything more than that. I felt the same way which is all I was looking for. I just wanted to spend a little more time with that character. It's more of a prologue than anything else. This movie did its job and did it well.

And for my itch to see the BB universe expanded, I got Better Call Saul."
