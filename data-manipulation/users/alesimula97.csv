programminghorror,fdn5n7h,t1_fdn3yqw,1578577961.0,"That would make the result of multiply(1,3) different than that of multiply(3,1)

Instead, let's build a function recursively decomposing a number to its factors of 1, so that the result of multiply(1,a) is a+1 and the result of multiply(a,b) is multiply(1,multiply(a-1, b))

This function doesn't assume anything, since we only know that 1\*1=2 and a\*1=a+1

His logic would still apply, swapping the parameters wouldn't change the result, and multiplication effectively becomes sum, so we can just simplify the function as multiply(a,b) = a+b"

So he basically turned multiplication into sum, because if     a\*1=a+1     then a\*b = a\*(1^b )     [with his logic] so    a\*b = a+b
