WhatDoISayNow,few6dts,t3_eqk9ma,1579405930.0,"Its not that big. Its ok. Just tell her the truth. You didnt know how to respond, you feel bad about your actions and she helped you become a better man for it. You thought about her feelings all day (most of the day or ect) and she has the right to be a little upset but to cut you slack since you care about her and no one is perfect. 

From a female. She will respect your honesty."
socialanxiety,feofenw,t3_eq3foa,1579299429.0,"You our normal you have good days and bad days. Everyone has good days and bad days. That is being normal. We all struggle with something. For us, it happens to be social situations. Don't compare your self with others (""to some one with SA! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!""). Hear me out. Don't compare your self with others because it adds fuel to the anxiety, try hard to not do it and remeber we all have flaws. you must do something better than everyone in that room but it does not matter, your self worth is not attached to your looks, or social skills, or talent or friends. You deserve to exit because you do and we all have flaws that does not make you less human. Remember just like you don't remember all the details of the wedding neither will the guest. No one will remember the conversations or ""mistakes"". Accept yourself and move on to better things. Remember the good things of the event and also that everyone else is obbsessing overthemselves to notice your anxiety. When that happens tell you self to not ruin the present moment for your self and concentrate on others instead of yourself. Helping others have given huge relief when I live through similar situations. I ask to help serve or if someone is worried about a dress or skirt I try to help, sometimes people feel down or have a headache. Listening to them or finding a pill for them or something small like that can really help me not concentrate on my emotions but rather what's happening at the moment."
socialanxiety,feodcd5,t3_eq6qrv,1579298624.0,Me. Two months ago.
socialanxiety,feod9ht,t3_eq702v,1579298572.0,"Thats is SA in a nutshell. Just trying to figure out your triggers and possible solutions is a good step foward. Just like you like for others to feel relax, good people also don't want to hurt your emotions. You can respectfully say ""I don't want to answer that."" Or ""I don't think we know each othet so well for me to share that."" Yes, you can just be true to your self and see if it works but I don't think so because we care about others opinions even to some degree. its about finding a balance, being blunt but also humble enough to gain the respect of others as in ""this person seems approachable, I want to talk to this person."" All about balance between funny and approachable but firm and experienced, being you but also respectful to others. At least they is what I believe. Another solution is you going up to the person and you taking control of the conversation and that way you get to ask the questions. I've been struggling with SA for a couple of years and there are months that I'm very much confident and then there are times where it returns and I struggle. The feeling of going up to someone and starting a conversation to me used to feel like the drop of a roller coaster literally but with enough practice, I learned to still do it in spite of the twists and turns of my stomach. It is possible."

socialanxiety,feobnfh,t3_eps3q0,1579297777.0,"I hate how this is me these past days. Some months I am fine, and other weeks are torture trying to convince my brain that I am not hated by the universe and even if I am, nothing out of the ordinary will happen. I can still live my life."
socialanxiety,feoaphq,t3_epy469,1579297434.0,Yes. Very much so.
AskMen,fc5pm5c,t3_egaa25,1577463269.0,"A fake laugh is not always bad though. Context, its all about context. If she is trying to laugh at something that is not so funny, she maybe trying to amuse you, make you feel relaxed. If she is uncomfortable, she will not laugh. Dont concentrate on making her laugh, concentrate on listening and conversing."
AskMen,fc5p2vy,t1_fc5c90u,1577462971.0,"As a female...this right here. All of it. And as a female...you can't really tell a fake laugh if you don't know her well. Women ""act"" their entire lives."
AskMen,fc5mam8,t1_fc51wtq,1577461346.0,What a plan.
AskMen,fc5m74c,t1_fc51cpo,1577461276.0,Thankyou.
AskReddit,f00iytf,t1_f00dhkc,1568302425.0,I don't know about now but in the mid-2000s an early 2000s Model Homes were filled with pretty decorations and yes expensive things.
