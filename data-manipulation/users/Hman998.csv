They play no conference championship game, the ACC which is a miserable conference makes up half of their games, 2 games are against depleted Pac 12 teams, they play Western Michigan, and they play the worst team in the SEC. 9 of their 12 games are either against teams from a terrible conference or teams that are currently struggling badly."

ND has a ton of talent and a schedule that is somewhat favorable, Stanford, SoCal, and Michigan are all way below past success levels. Then again my only memories of Notre Dame in a playoff/BCS situation was getting destroyed by Alabama so bad that Brent Musburger went crowd searching for good looking ladies. Then there was ND's pre determined destruction at the hands of Clemson last year. ND and Oklahoma have alot in common.

There are plenty of options though depending on how much cc the team you are playing has. Basically thorns and blink are good if you're being aggressive, shell is pretty good if you use it at the right time (in a team fight). I would consider bracer if you were against a pure burst mage, either that aegis or thorns. I consider beads almost a must have just because of how many situations they can get you out of."

CFB,fdfflri,t1_fdepoc6,1578360552.0,"Tua played us this year, literally 75% of the game plan were slant routes. It's not a knock on Tua, it's a product of them having blazing fast wide receivers. That's football 101, fast receiver either get him vertical or hit him on a short route and let him do the work. That's why Clemson had such an easy time against him last year, they sat safeties and linebackers right in the path of the slants and vertical patterns and just waited for the ball. Obviously none of you watched the pick six in last years natty, it was a defensive move that a high school coach could employ but a genius one at that..... if he's running simple pre determined routes (aka slant, down and out, verts) just sit a guy in the passing lane and wait for the ball."

Smite,fdclopk,t3_ekn2yw,1578278003.0,"Supports ordinarily help you and make sure you get the exp you need. Freyas early game is not good, she is not even close to being one of the better lane push mages. That said maybe start bancrofts instead of ring first because you really don't need the attack speed until your aa's actually do enough damage. Bancroft will give you that 100 power right off the bat and enable you to clear a little better early game. Still make sure to get the rings in the middle of the build. Just spitballing here but go (Bancroft, boots), demonic, hastened ring, typhons fang, telekenesis ring. Sell boots for rod of tahuti or whatever else you may need late game. Maybe get boots online at least partially built so you don't get caught out. Right now Freya is broken and needs to be nerfed again so take advantage while it last, she'll be gone once they see she's being picked too often in pro matches."

Smite,fdbo1u4,t1_fdbjsva,1578259321.0,"Ehh I think both Hunters and Mages should be able to take on tanks or squishies depending on the situation. I also believe that a skilled mage should have flat pen in order to annihilate an assasin if they can outplay the assasin. Flip side of that is that assasins are also able to easily kill mages, those 2 classes should effectively have the same potential on one another. Also I think you may actually see a shift to a tankier mage meta with Warlocks and some of the etherial staff, gem of isolation tree being utilized more. Also Spear of deso is going to be very strong, with no change to flat pen and all they did was buff the damage."

Smite,fdanyct,t3_ekgfde,1578248216.0,Hades used to be a Guardian and in some ways he still reminds me of one. I never have seen hades as a mage you build with zero protection  because his dash and ult are suicide without it. If you change his ult I do believe you would have to remove some of the cc to make him more like other burst mages. A dancing hades that can pull you and then follow you after you use beads would be aids. You usually build protection on Zhong to so he is not alone.

It's the gameplay that really makes ubisoft great not so much the story. Like the animus crap with AC I've always thought that was stupid, it kills the immersion of me being an assassin in any given historical period. I get that having the abstergo storyline connects and somewhat makes sense of all the stuff you are doing, but why can't I just be a badass assassin? If they took away the animus and all the abstergo things and focused more on individual characters in the setting of the game they would easily enter the realm of a skyrim or witcher 3 type discussion. Far Cry on the other hand seems to be great for immersion and it doesn't force you out of it but it's never been the greatest as far as storytelling. Far Cry is definitely more focused on giving you an open world and just letting you tear stuff up.
