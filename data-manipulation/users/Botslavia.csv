Mario Rabbids on the Switch. I got to a level with loads of giant dudes on different heights and I just couldn’t do it. In my head I don’t see how I’m ever going to do it."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffqyhn6,t3_eukwcp,1580146489.0,"As someone who has done that. But also 100% freelanced doing “fun” things. Sometimes structure and normalcy is a very comfortable place to be in.
