melbourne,ffmdpnu,t1_fflxkab,1580053050.0,"A mask can block droplets the virus live on while in the air. Combine that with a functional immune system a normal person should be fine. P2/n95 is better at this but as long as you are not going to a room full of these patients, one does not need a full on suit."
melbourne,ffmdfq9,t1_fflwnfa,1580052881.0,"While its not gonna block virus, it can certainly block droplet that carries the virus. At 1m distance, one of those blue masks or the dust ones are good enough for a normal person. If you gonna go to hospitals, get a p2/n95 one."

melbourne,ffmc7f7,t1_ffl89ud,1580052254.0,Its reddit. We are used to it by now. I get called a shill whenever i speak in favor of China or Chinese people.
melbourne,ffmb03t,t1_ffl0xbd,1580051643.0,"Due to the symptom is super close to common cold, the diagnostic progress is painfully slow. But with the testing strip coming into the play, its likely the number will see a sharp increase before it calms down a bit. 

I dont doubt the local government initially didnt think much of it and wanted to hide the numbers shotly after that. But now the situation is under central government control i dont see why they need to lie about it, especially they invited WHO officials to come and do their own investigation. 

The problem i see is, the Chinese government couldn't just make up a number like us do on social media. Saying there has to be 10k people caught this is not ok as a country, that would be an extremely unreasonable thing to do in times like this. The only number they can say as an official number is confirmed cases."
melbourne,ffm9r27,t1_ffl8zcl,1580050991.0,"Exactly, they had all the parts casts and with most of the city on lock down the trucks can just rush through streets to get to where they need to go"
melbourne,ffm9dwc,t1_ffldrw8,1580050909.0,"I guess you didnt see how slow the tram works are done in Sydney then. There was a dude driving a small excavator moving a pile of dirt to another and then back. 

Im not BMing aussie here, just saying its almost a joke now how we need 10 people to dig a hole - 6 lollipop people, 3 chatting, and 1 actually does it."
melbourne,ffm8n2o,t1_ffm1e00,1580050436.0,"Its no 5 stars hospitals. But they are much better than shitholes. They provide isolation to the element, privacy, power, and room to house medical equipment. 


They are not slave labor. They are building it to help their people and in turn save their own families, because a lot of the construction workers lives in that city with their families. There are volunteers in them. But then there are volunteers in bushfire fightings too. 


There are factories are paying their workers triple pay to bring them back to work so close to the Chinese new year (there are normally a 2 weeks holiday for most Chinese as this is the most important time of a year. It is also traditionally associated with uniting with the family).


My parents worked on the front line of sars at one of those makeshift hospitals. Same brand, same construction standard and they are built to serve a single goal - to get people through this trying time. They are not expecting this to stand forever and ever, they dont even expect them to last to the end of this year, but if the hospital is to have any issues before the pandemic ends, the construction company will get flayed; if this stands throughout they would be celebrated as heroes and top of the line builders, they know that, so they will do this solid."
videos,ffjshjp,t3_etz0ea,1580005738.0,"The local government is a laughing stock of almost all Chinese social networks at this point. I think one of those leaders didnt even know how to put on a mask properly. 


All that being said, things are back in order now since the central government took over the local government. I have many friends back in China and Wuhan. They are, for the most part, very optimistic. A few complains here and there but are happy how things are going. 


I know many people hate China around here, but please dont believe everything people say online purely based on the fact that they speak Chinese or its a screenshot of a wechat. Do your own research. They are opportunist spreading hatred towards to China making the already tough situation even more chaos. 

This is not to say what he said is fake news. But im sick of seeing people spreading fear and fake news and videos around this."
