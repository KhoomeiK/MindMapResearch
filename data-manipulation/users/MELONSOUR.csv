I had lunch with two colleagues this week and when asked what I wanted to study (my current alibi is law because I cant tell anyone that I'm thinking about studying communication design).
One of them is a lawyer and he told me that for the love of god, dont study law, the workload in both study and job is inhumane, you dont get paid nearly well enough, it eats away on your health like crazy, women get treated especially worse, etc. He told me he wouldnt do it again, he'd rather study art history ""... or become a rockstar""

AskReddit,fbqmtn9,t3_ee3b1i,1577033304.0,"I have a lovely boyfriend, a decent family, a paying job and goals for the upcoming year and my sense of self has improved a lot in the last two years.
I should be at a good part of my life, all (or most) doors are open to choose from. Still I'm not okay and I feel so ungrateful to say that. I'm still functioning, but lately it feels like sometimes I'm slipping from reality, everything feels so unreal sometimes. My disordered eating is hitting me back at full force, I feel guilty whenever I feel full but I know what it did to the people I love and my body and mind the last time and I'm trying to keep it all together. I hate working with food, cooking and baking have become a chore although I used to enjoy it. Even dancing, a thing that used to consume my every being, feels like a lot lately. I still enjoy drawing and trying to turn that into a career, but I feel like I'm never going to be quite good enough in this highly competitive business. I should be grateful, and I am, but somehow I still feel like everything is doomed to fall apart."
