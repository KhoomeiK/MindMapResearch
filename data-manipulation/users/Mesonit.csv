JudgeMyAccent,ffdeqji,t1_ffdegjw,1579819326.0,What accent do you usually speak with? Does it depend on who you're speaking to?
JudgeMyAccent,ffdawi8,t1_ffdad5z,1579816917.0,Your American sounds pretty much perfect to me. Why are you learning both accents?
French,ffd78o6,t3_esxl24,1579814780.0,"It's a nice idea. Is it specific to French? ""WriteStreak"" is a bit vague."
JudgeMyAccent,ffd5t13,t3_esxcf0,1579813982.0,"Sounds good, it's perfectly understandable.

I think you should try to emphasise the word stresses more. At the minute your syllables all have similar weight and so it sounds a bit robotic. Don't speak too fast.

Maybe you should try add a puff of air (aspiration) after the consonants t, p, c, otherwise they could sound like d, b, g (particularly evident in words like aunt, route, caught)."

Spanish,fezh5qk,t1_fezfxn2,1579457293.0,Catalan is still technically in between Spanish and French though. Anyway the point of the Romance continuum is that there are no borders. What is Moçarabic?
French,fezg3x5,t1_fezc9ec,1579456964.0,"Well I don't see the point in arguing. Anyway, here are some basic approximations (maybe useful for identifying fillers in films etc)

Spanish,fea3pdw,t1_fe8xug3,1578944040.0,"In general the Romance languages are a continuum. So Catalan is certainly in between Spanish and French. And it is even more similar to the languages that were spoken in Southern France, Occitan."

French,fdgjta6,t1_fdgj46d,1578399647.0,"Interesting. I guess that ""fai"" is an open syllable (by the Maximal Onset Principle) so by the loi de position the vowel is é, not è."
