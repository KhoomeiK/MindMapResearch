Tinder,ffcpu70,t1_ffcf7fl,1579804678.0,Lol flowers. I meant flossers. Why would I even practice with such an inferior tool?
Tinder,ffblbm7,t1_ffb71xr,1579770910.0,Why don’t you use flowers though? Like I can’t get my fingers in my mouth far enough to get to my molars. My dad only uses floss too I don’t get it
tifu,ff8z4go,t3_es489q,1579700630.0,"I divorced my wife for a lot less dude. I didn’t have kids, but coming from a broken home, I still would have because I know it is possible for the kids to have a good life. My dad married my stepmom 25 years ago and she’s been more like a mom to me than my own mother ever has. Point is, if you’re not happy, remove yourself. You’re not doing her a favor, your kids a favor, or, most importantly, you a favor."
AskReddit,ff68b0z,t3_erstu3,1579621500.0,"In the Army you’re taught to sleep with as little clothes on as possible if it’s cold or else you’re layers lose effectiveness when you’re back in the cold. To that end, you underestimate a humans ability to put clothes on in an emergency"

funny,feslwwj,t1_fesfbui,1579366614.0,"For me, I guess it’s the tie and the baggy pants. It just looks very silly. The Marines look the best IMO, but I suppose that’s more of a style preference. I was Army and didn’t like our uniforms because they made us look like airline pilots lol"
pics,fesky2o,t1_fesjx7p,1579366302.0,"Can you explain that? Is the solution making all drugs legal? I really don’t understand. Either they’re legal and  the black market for them shrinks, or they’re illegal and the market thrives. Making cocaine legal, for instance, doesn’t seem like a feasible plan to me. What about our policies could be changed to hurt the cartels?"
pics,fes8ed2,t1_fes77ek,1579362499.0,I’m sorry I really don’t understand what you said. So all drugs are legal in Europe? Or the policies are written in a way that didnt create a black market?
funny,fes7mna,t1_fes5zvu,1579362201.0,Their dress uniforms look really stupid too (the enlisted guys...officers look sharp)
pics,fes5aa2,t1_fes1t14,1579361534.0,"Well they are having their gun fights in Mexico for the most part soo..yeah? I realize gang violence does make it over the border, but border security certainly helps keep the bulk of it away."
pics,fes4uqo,t1_fes2b3m,1579361440.0,"...in Mexico, yes. Again, I don’t think you guys are actually getting the point. I’m not talking about the US. I’m talking about why the US needs a fence in the south and not the north."
pics,ferqc4r,t1_fernai8,1579357133.0,I have actually. Lived 5 miles from it
pics,fermc20,t1_fere82y,1579355720.0,Lol okay
pics,ferazj5,t1_fer4roo,1579351830.0,So do we...we put up a fence (the topic of the conversation) to keep them at bay. Not the US fault that Mexico doesn’t want our help and can’t deal with the problem on their own
pics,fer84uq,t1_fer70ez,1579350980.0,You guys are all missing the actual point. That there is a literal war zone in Mexico which makes the organized crime vastly different from what Europe has. That is why there is a fence in the south but not in the north. I’m sorry you’re having so much trouble with this
pics,fer3y63,t1_feqw4re,1579349518.0,Can you show me some videos of shootouts between the EU governments and organized crime? Because the cartels have technicals over here and there are dozens of easy to find videos that make it look like the purge
pics,fer3nx1,t1_feqwggx,1579349422.0,Ugh that’s what’s happening in Mexico holy crap dude
pics,feqvo5f,t1_feqp1bv,1579346606.0,Taking over the countries and basically running the government? I think you’re missing my point here
Tinder,feqmssp,t1_feqj8jq,1579343647.0,"You don’t have to to have seen this a million times which was my point. It’s definitely not your fault **and** doesn’t matter since every time I see it, there are people in the comments who haven’t seen it, but it does get posted a lot. You could build a small database of like 24 profiles and that will cover 90% of tinder."
pics,feqlrq7,t1_feqjpqj,1579343367.0,Ahh yes. The famous German cartels that have been all over international news. How could I have missed that

Showerthoughts,feqb414,t1_fepma9d,1579339646.0,"I just read an article from Ben and Jerry (it was the top hit on google). I’m still confused why water content is an issue. I get that they won’t make grape because no one wants grape, but the guy said that even cherry is difficult to produce on a large scale. We dehydrate and concentrate flavors all the time. Not sure why water content would create “engineering hurdles”. I don’t expect you to answer the question but I thought it was an interesting topic and wanted to put my thoughts out there lol"
Showerthoughts,feq8vod,t1_feq6x9d,1579338994.0,Diary cows are forced to breed and their babies are ripped from them so they can be perpetually milked while spending most of their life standing in a yoke barely big enough for them to sway their body. Is that the life you’re wishing on cute cows?

HomeDepot,feq34n0,t1_feq2lk8,1579336932.0,"Can’t blame you for that! My unit was deactivated in the middle of my enlistment and during the transition, we also did absolutely nothing. There were certain platoons that had very important and high level missions, so they kept mine around to do leg work and assisting for them. Everyone does their part, I suppose."

I can blast music and there aren’t cameras to watch me. Not that I do anything wrong back there it’s just nice not being under big brother’s eye. It’s not for everyone I suppose

HomeDepot,fepw0gl,t1_fepjvdz,1579333316.0,You had to have done some kind of online training. National guard/reserves can’t be that bad. Unless they choose to fill your weekend with power points that also satisfy the requirements. You can’t deploy or go TDY without a lot of those required trainings. At least that’s how it works in the *real* Army lol
HomeDepot,feok4g3,t3_eq310w,1579301303.0,"Shouldn’t really bother you if you don’t mispunch. The only people who would care are people who submit goobers when they are late, and those are the people the policy is aimed at."
