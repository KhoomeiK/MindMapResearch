In my E2E server, I started out putting too much effort into a big above-ground base with the intention of putting in a whole skyscraper up on the hill overlooking a small bay.

Fast forward to when the building is complete enough to live in, and I started putting more and more of my machines up there but I still lived primarily off the shores because moving all my chests and machines was too much of a pain.

When I got Applied Energistics, instead of moving into that building I took my glider and explored the world until I found an even nicer place.  Then, because I'm tired of my structures never fitting in, I just put a circle on the ground to denote where my base was going to be, built two elevators, and used a Builder to clean out a massive multi-level complex straight to bedrock.

AskReddit,felgxep,t1_felezd7,1579221908.0,"Had a friend who named all five children (and possibly planning on a sixth...) with K's and Y's.  Specifically, it starts with a K, is usually a normal-ish name, but then they screw the spelling to hell by putting a Y in there somewhere.

He, the husband, is kind of exasperated but just rolls with it.  I never could convince the wife, also a friend of mine, that it's the dumbest shit ever and the kids will be annoyed by it in fifteen years.

He's kind of a pushover in that relationship though... he wanted two kids, she wanted six, they compromised on six."

It's not as much of a big deal anymore though, to be frank.  I don't think I've ever heard of a single person who enlisted under it, though if you get a friend to sign up with you in general you can start as an E2 instead of an E1 in the Army."

I do know that there exist programs to try and keep people together though, if you want to sign up and serve with your best friend for the same job or something.

Recently at work I've entered a sort of holding pattern of knocking out tasks quickly as I wait for the end of my employment so I can move on to my next job.  I find that with my extra free time, I'm watching a lot of videos of things like people correcting traffic in Cities: Skylines, or showing off builds in Path of Exile.

Minecraft I think is one I just absolutely can't get into, because there's no brevity in it whatsoever.  It seems exceedingly rare to find a video that's short and to the point about whatever I want, and in all situations, I would universally prefer a good text document with some pictures to explain something.

Really, when it comes down to it, if I want to watch someone else struggle through a pack in realtime at the same or slower speed than I could, I'd just hop onto my server and follow one of my friends around for an hour.
