But like another poster has said,  it's good to have a pair of leather or canvas non-athletic shoes for daily wear, for style."

Engage in *active* self care,  like healthy eating,  learning something,  and more gentle exercise like a walk.   Journaling is also active self care.  But it's not either-or:  you can have a pretty restful day but just get some things done in an unhurried way.   Stretching is great for days like this and very important if you're working out."

productivity,ff8ch4b,t3_es7gpd,1579672875.0,"It's probably more effective to make your mind maps by hand,  because it activates the motor cortex in a more complex way.
