politics,fel0e8p,t1_fejxwyh,1579211373.0,When you look from Clinton to Trump I can’t tell if your talking about the blue team or the red team.... I really wish we would work togather to clean out both parties.
tifu,fekzyzp,t3_epgrgt,1579211120.0,"100% why I don’t go through any of my parents shit. If anything bad happens my wife knows she gets to clean anything out that I will change my opinion of my parents..... I know this may make me sound strange, I realize my parents are human and I just want to keep my blissful ignorance"
funny,feko4ce,t1_fekacmq,1579204097.0,"Look up the definition of malice. There is a certain type of crazy that wouldn’t think it was wrong or evil, just pure joy of taking life. It’s definitely extra fucked up"
science,fdsa70k,t1_fdre6ul,1578697914.0,We just went out and watched a watermelon get shot by a hand gun. It’s super neat and after we tried to do the same damage with our bare hands. I still remember that 30ish years later.
science,fdsa1ai,t1_fdrsr91,1578697807.0,Great comment
Futurology,fdk0eq0,t1_fdj40ac,1578492924.0,I would be interested in what you have written and the sources.
Futurology,fdj0nx4,t1_fdip7qk,1578455449.0,"This is off topic, but being from Australia, I’ve seen a few things about your government stopping controlled burns and clearing; is this true? Do you think this has been an impact?

Edit: Jesus Reddit, down votes for asking a simple question to a person I assume is a local and a firefighter"

movies,fcvfaz9,t1_fcuaamx,1578000891.0,"Am I the only one that sees the irony of “record number of films” = like 5 fucking films.... also me, since when is it an amazing feat that women can direct I am sitting here like “yea no fucking shit women are equally as talented as men in directing”"
movies,fcveu21,t1_fc5j0qp,1578000615.0,"If they would actually show a female perspective it would be great, but it’s just going to be an action movie with a sexy lead.... the same shit but lead will have tits.  

I just want great movie (alien, terminator) give me a charter that grows, that I can sorta relate to that rises to the challenge."
gifs,fcv0s9v,t3_eiyhyr,1577992312.0,One of the best advertisements I think I have ever seen.....
GetMotivated,fcufbwo,t1_fcu3wzc,1577979589.0,Came here to post the same idea.... smart people know they don’t know everything and normally enjoy learning something new.
aww,fco0g4s,t1_fcmc6lw,1577821851.0,My favorite part is the kid isn’t perfect and the dad is still proud. I constantly have to remind myself of letting mine make small mistakes Roth no correction because they will learn on there own; as long as they are trying that’s what really matters
DestinyTheGame,fcnsuqg,t1_fcnou2r,1577817763.0,You are correct.... any idea if this is PC only? Google just shows some images with the “dual monitor” options but can’t find too much detail on it.
DestinyTheGame,fcno07r,t1_fcm5i5i,1577815121.0,The only customizable HUDs I know of in any games are 3rd party mods..... when you are developing for 3 different consoles and pc it’s tricky to give everyone what they want

pics,fcl6edr,t1_fcl2tis,1577740796.0,I don’t think you can read pimp. I’ve never seen an account pushing any product and sure as fuck would buy anything because of a Reddit account. You need to learn to internet better
pics,fcl0e1t,t1_fckdksk,1577737084.0,Why does that matter???? Have you ever bought anything because a random account on reddit had a lot of karma?
GetMotivated,fca0n9e,t1_fc9sf26,1577561050.0,"Went to art school and have had this conversation a lot. My POV: Their mental illness may have given them a unique way to interpret the world, but it’s impossible to prove, we should celebrate their willingness to continue to express their ideas even though the majority pushed back and we should celebrate the uniqueness of their art.  Outside of that it’s all opinion and guesses."
GetMotivated,fc9mbo7,t1_fc9bd2f,1577554819.0,"Do you have a name or a link to the story, I have a ton of questions and no idea where to start looking."
Futurology,fc8u3id,t1_fc7mim6,1577541985.0,I still think it’s a bad idea. We know so little about how the oceans eco system survives and we are planning on using it to make money....... and I’m a really free market conservative person
DestinyTheGame,fc3rd03,t1_fc372wb,1577396689.0,"I don’t think so, I fall into what I like to call “casual hardcore” I used to be a hardcore gamer and then got my real job and just cannot invest the time I want to, so I would really like to be able to play what I want when I get the chance and not be punished for it; I feel punished because I still have the hardcore mind set where I am going to use the most efficient way to get what I want. I really think it’s easy:

Strike specific gear, raid gear should be arguably the best, crucible should have rewards for the top players (gear specific to that), I love the gambit specific gear, bounties the way they are should be the bench mark for Xp gain (avg xp with bounties =10,000 xp an hour so everything should net as close as possible to 10,000 xp an hour)."
