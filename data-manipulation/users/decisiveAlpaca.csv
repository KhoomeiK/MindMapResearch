HistoricalWhatIf,fdfi8sh,t3_ejxhdx,1578362315.0,"Depends on when they entered the war. If it's early on in the conflict like 1940 or even 1942 it could be a game changer. Especially Spain and Turkey, it was a major Axis strategic objective to take the fortress of Gibraltar. Spain stubbornly refused to enter the war or even allow German troop passage to Gibraltar even after the fall of France. If the Spanish allowed even 3 or 4 German divisions to take Gibraltar it could change the course of the war, without the control access to the western Mediterranean British supply, and Royal Navy support to North Africa and Malta will be compromised. That means anything going to Egypt will have to make the several week long journey around Africa making the allies response to Axis offensive slow and the British will have a hard time supply any offensives of their own into Libya. Also the British at this time are putting down local rebellions in the Middle East, so they were fighting both the locals and the Axis in North Africa, add Turkey to the mix it gets really dicy for the Brits. 

If the Axis take control of North Africa and the Middle East, it could very well mean the end of the war for the allies (at least the Soviets and British)"
