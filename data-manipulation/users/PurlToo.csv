crossfit,ffe3055,t3_et2n4s,1579835367.0,"I need a water bottle spot that has easy access (preferably external) for easy hydration on the go. I don't want to have to open my bag in the car on the way to the gym if I'm thirsty. 


Also, easy access highly visible inhaler pocket for those ""help I need my inhaler"" moments. Normally I'm good, but once and a while there's a perfect storm of things that just kill my lungs, and I'm just a dumb dumb that forgets to take it on the floor with me way too often."
crossfit,ffe2gus,t1_ffcq3u1,1579834969.0,"I also think many people are bad at counting their calories. I had a friend, recreational crossfitter, doing RP with me. I was measuring every last thing down to the oil I was cooking with and dropping way more than the estimated 1lb/week. Meanwhile he was twice my size and stagnating. We were discussing our favorite recipes. He was adding parmesan cheese to his roasted veggies and not counting any of the macros from the cheese because it was on his veggies. Smh.


Also. Have you ever watched a show called Secret Eaters? It's a guilty pleasure of mine. Wow do people under count."
crossfit,ffe1vxy,t1_ffcv6ec,1579834540.0,"While the two women are of similar height and weight, we don't know the weight I'd the professional male athlete. He could have a good bit of muscle mass on the recreational male crossfitter."
crossfit,ffe1kw1,t1_ffctmz1,1579834317.0,"I fit the description of example 3, and when I was trying to get to 130 I was eating 1600 calories a day to lose one pound a week. 2200 calories would be a third more, that seems reasonable to me for maintaining."

RealEstate,ff89hx4,t1_ff7v4l3,1579669972.0,"It's weird for sure. But at your same time when I was a buyer I got all sorts of advice about drive through the neighborhood at different times to see if it's loud or gets crazy. Try to view the property at a time people would be home in adjacent units to make sure you can't hear them and it's not just quiet because everyone is away at work at 2pm. Maybe their current residence has an issue where internet service slows to essentially unusable during peak hours, so your sit on the sofa making sure they can stream movies when home from work during the evening. Much advice given to be a prudent buyer seems kinda weird/creepy when on the other side of it."
relationships,ff7mqrg,t1_ff7f7qb,1579653257.0,Sounds to me like she is looking for an out and doesn't want the end of the relationship to be her fault in her mind. She didn't end things when she was unhappy enough to cheat. She didn't end things when she was caught. She wants to be able to end things and say it's all OP's fault for being friends with this woman and not at all her fault for cheating in the first place.
datingoverthirty,ff6z8tv,t1_ff6yj4x,1579637938.0,"Even if there is a spark, then you're stuck trying to have a conversation and chew food which always gets awkward."
datingoverthirty,ff6ia9b,t3_ersyud,1579627791.0,"Matches with a guy that wanted to start planning a date almost immediately. I generally prefer coffee for first dates so if the conversation is stagnate it's not that big of a deal. It can be over in an hour. 

We'd only just settled on a day, hadn't set up a time yet, and he's asking where I live, I presume to know what side of town I lived on to pick a place. I've got my radius set so that even if he picked a place by him I'd not mind driving there, plus this was Hinge so I had a rough idea where he was because it specifies neighborhoods.  Because of this I didn't ask him where he lived in return. Suddenly he shuts down. ""I can see you're not into this"" sort of statements. I explained the reasons I just gave for not asking where he lived in return, but was already growing weary because he was being hella high maintenance for someone I matched with less than an hour before. 

Then he stops trying to plan the date to demand selfies. I get that people are worried about being catfished, but once again a short coffee date can be cut even shorter if your show up to a catfish, which is why I prefer these low stakes first dates.

I refused to send pics because there was already so many red flags. Asked him why he was making things weird, cause he was. He starts cursing me out and calling me names, all through text. I'm trying to figure out what on Earth triggered this. Seriously all because I didn't ask him where he lived? Then I remembered he's a total stranger and I owe him nothing and blocked him."
aww,ff50k6b,t1_ff4s0m1,1579576997.0,I ordered a cider called Ananas and was so confused it was pineapple and not banana. Now it all makes sense.
orlando,ff4yp0z,t3_erkbqe,1579575644.0,Have you tried the NextDoor app? It would be more local to the neighborhood.
AmItheAsshole,ff4targ,t1_ff4ssy2,1579571930.0,Yes. Two other neighbors have expressed annoyance with this vehicle. One I know has also spoken with them. Seems they just move it away from whoever asked last back to someone else's yard. But never once to their own.
AmItheAsshole,ff4iwd9,t1_ff4iu9w,1579564695.0,Because they don't move it for a week at a time which is *technically* abandoned.

AmItheAsshole,ff3v5hw,t3_erfvwt,1579549536.0,"NTA. She was expecting to use it in five months but hasn't bothered to come try it on or take it to be altered to fit her? No way it would be ready for her in time. 

Not to mention, if you tried to alter it after she got married in it she would be all, ""you're defacing MY wedding dress!"""
TooAfraidToAsk,ff2d9qa,t1_ff022ja,1579501484.0,"They likely don't have ID on them and get admitted as a John Doe or under a fake name, so they never get a bill."

I was planning on easing him into these uncomfortable conversations while he was still young and healthy and then... chance gone. All I know is he wanted to be cremated. We never really discussed anything else. I don't know what bills I need to cancel, what bank it's probably all still auto drafting from, where the keys to the car are. I don't know. And worst of all, I barely have any pictures. I wish I had a video, with his face and his voice and him rolling his eyes at me because it's so silly to be this prepared this far in advance. But the truth is you never know when something terrible is going to happen and you've lost your opportunity forever."

It has nothing to do with who OP is as a man and everything to do with who Sarah is as a human being. Sarah is the shitty type of person that cheated. She's an even shittier person because she cheats and doesn't think she should have to face the consequences of her actions while drawing other people into it.

Please, OP, don't be humiliated by her actions. You could be the manliest lumberjack in all the woods and her cheating ass would have still cheated. This is on her. Not you."
