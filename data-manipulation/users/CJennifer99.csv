AskReddit,fcps1fg,t3_eigf6m,1577870901.0,"My father and myself. My father is an ass and tends to avoid the rest of the family. When he met me in 2012 he started to socialise more. But in 2016 he cut all contact with me because I didn’t tell him I was going away for the week as he hadn’t phoned the weekend before, due to this I hardly ever hear from my paternal grandparents nor my uncles."
