WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekf9fk,t3_epl7kd,1579198817.0,"she's in new jersey, and we're in colorado, but my wife and i just filled out an application for her. hoping they'll allow an out of state adoption!!

edit: i read their adoption requirements, but i’m hoping where my wife and i live will sweeten the pot a little (we live on 2 acres that backs up to 70 miles of wilderness area, it’s husky heaven) we would also be willing to pick her up.

2nd edit: got an email back from Husky House saying they won't do long-distance adoptions, but I'm not accepting that answer. going to see what kind of workarounds we can wrangle up.

3rd edit: emailed again asking if we could coordinate with one of our local rescues to get her out here. i also want to add that we are serious as a heart attack about getting her. we bought this land with the intention on saving as many animals as we can.

4th edit: emailed back and forth with Husky House a few times, but they will not entertain the idea of a long-distance adoption. hopefully this sweet gal finds a home, soon."
OldManDog,fekdlzl,t1_fek3a2u,1579197831.0,thank you - everyone in this thread has been so kind. it's making my day!
OldManDog,fekdjv3,t1_fek5gz6,1579197797.0,"i know you didn't ask me, but i've had a lot of dogs over the years, and it all comes down to you (and your vet) assessing and determining what their quality of life is really like. diseases like DM can take their mobility away, but if they still have their spirit, then it's up to you to make life as comfortable as possible for them."
OldManDog,fekdbxs,t1_fek3t6e,1579197665.0,"it's such a bummer to watch your pup go through it. every now and again, he poops himself while he's asleep. always fun shampoo'ing poop out of your extra-furry dog's butt at 5am. he and i have developed our own little routine for poops, and things have been great, lately.

all the best to your sweet gal!"
OldManDog,fek8bzg,t1_fek71z5,1579194716.0,i am dying. this is fantastic.
