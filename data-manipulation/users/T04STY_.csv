formula1,ffgjyh5,t1_ffg16cc,1579907966.0,"Absolutely, they always put on a great show."
formula1,fffyszl,t1_fffygkx,1579894765.0,"DPi's are LMP2 chassis with self developed aero, engine etc. So they could be considered P2 evos. But this annoumcement is about the merge of DPi and the new WEC Hypercars. P2 will stay P2."
trucksim,fffttov,t3_et9w1e,1579891655.0,"You could try and install one of the ""improved signs"" mods. But I don't know if they're turned lower by the graphics settings."
trainsimworld,fffehx8,t3_etaxaz,1579882202.0,I think all of them. The tab is in all of them and you can pick journeys in all of them.
aww,ffe2ljr,t3_et3grw,1579835065.0,Oh not again...
HPHogwartsMystery,ffd1zs0,t3_esxrdd,1579811839.0,"It's always happening. Every time the words now, immediately, quickly or any of  these are used you can be sure there will be a timer lol"
CatsAreAssholes,ffcwfg6,t3_estpu1,1579808684.0,Yeah that's photoshopped.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ff6l13o,t1_ff64o8z,1579629463.0,"Wow that sucks...maybe try go down with some settings, like shadows etc. Maybe your gpu/cpu is bottlenecking and won't load it.

But it rather looks like a file is missing or a line about LOD loaddistance is messed up. I don't know if Odyssey works with .ini files, maybe you'd find something there.

Or you could try a clean reinstall and hope it won't happen again."
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ff639eg,t3_erv9zx,1579618038.0,No that's not supposed to happen like that.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ff1n0ro,t1_ff15pde,1579481883.0,Sure who can't remember the historic books and drawings where they were fighting each other with 2.5 meter long Q-tips.
assassinscreed,feyupbi,t1_feyu25n,1579450757.0,"Absolutely. The issue is that their hands are/were a bit tied there. That's what they had back then, they can't just put canons on the ship.

But there are some options that could be explored like small catapults and burning oil like in rogue."

AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fercl8u,t3_eqftgc,1579352379.0,Overpower abilities is when you press R for axample and you're getting that one heavy hit/chain attack. It usually costs 3 adrenaline but with that engraving it'll only cost 2 bars of adrenaline.
assassinscreed,felme44,t3_eptb9a,1579225646.0,"Games are supposed to be fun. If you're not having fun with it you should stop playing it or take a break for a couple of weeks. 

Also maybe try another playstyle. When I got a bit bored I mixed it up with a heavy axe (usually not a fan of heavy weapons) and played way more offensive and aggressive. Had a ton of fun doing that."
aww,fek3t9o,t3_epl478,1579192016.0,Hey Jun!
aww,fek33su,t1_fek1lp8,1579191588.0,Yeah it's so annoying.
trainsim,fegxfyb,t1_fegx9x4,1579104694.0,"Yeah okay, just wasn't sure if you mixed them up.

Since December 2019 it's called TSW 2020. The basecontent changed etc."
trainsim,fegvj8u,t1_fegt2ke,1579103482.0,"Are you mixing up Train Sim World 2020 and TS2020?

oddlysatisfying,feeelyb,t1_fedvjlg,1579032163.0,Well...not at night.
simracing,fee1xio,t1_fedjf8q,1579024695.0,Yeah that's where it usually is but the 4400 has quite a few switches and no fuze called warning devices.

assassinscreed,fdxcokz,t3_en6yp4,1578767460.0,Yes please.
assassinscreed,fdu2z9k,t1_fdta9j5,1578726612.0,I really can't see this happening tbh. Guess it's just missing from the source because it is a given and they just wanted to state to what consoles it'll come.
trucksim,fdqdsy2,t1_fdq8smx,1578664026.0,Really wow. I've been to a lot of european countries (not UK obviously) and I've never seen that before.
trucksim,fdq6aax,t3_emp840,1578656731.0,Petrol is cheaper than diesel? Where are you living.
ACCompetizione,fdnzd42,t1_fdnwn5b,1578595930.0,"Correct.

It should indicate it, yes. But we had no word from Kunos about it yet so we do not know if it's a bug or badly implemented yet. 

But I'm totally with you. The mandatory indicator should turn orange again or there should be a proper notification. Then you could at least just drive through and not waste another 30 secs minimum with the stop."
ACCompetizione,fdntmfg,t3_embq36,1578592586.0,Maybe you cit the inside white line of the pit entry? That can cause the pitstop not being counted.
trucksim,fdi2da9,t3_elghnc,1578434500.0,"Yes the left one, it's definitely shorter!"
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fdhmy2b,t3_eleyj3,1578426056.0,"No it only works with two handed weapons like a spear, axe, staff or mace."
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fdg2d1j,t3_el5gl3,1578377450.0,Explore and finish the islands. Also bounties are good for xp.
trains,fdg0rsj,t3_el6dsi,1578375869.0,Wow great shot m8!
trainsimworld,fdg0goz,t3_el5xk6,1578375573.0,"Yeah I don't think it has one. Checked every corner as well but couldn't find it. Maybe it's automated, when it's got energy it lights up the gauges."
ACCompetizione,fdf6hvb,t1_fddz9lh,1578354424.0,Well I tried a short 10 lap stint on Caralunya with max fuel and base aggressive setup and I have to say the Merc still was fairly easy to drive. You had to be a bit careful with trailbraking and rapid turnins but otherwise it was very stable and controlable. Maybe it's just your driving style that doesn't suit the car.
oddlysatisfying,fddyqiv,t3_ekulir,1578327216.0,Wrong sub.
ACCompetizione,fddwqcm,t1_fddwk6u,1578325847.0,"The AMG can be tricky when you overdrive it, to hard on the throttle out of mid speed corners but I haven't driven it enough to tell if it gets difficult on high fuel. Gotta check that later."
ACCompetizione,fddugqu,t3_ekv283,1578324268.0,"Well usually all front engined cars are pretty easy to drive and not as easy to spin. Mid and rear engine is way more snappy. Try the AMG or the V8 Aston, they're both very stable."
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fdd6z45,t3_ekomw8,1578297563.0,"It really doesn't matter, the only thing that changes are the colours. 

If you find the leader and he isn't to heaviely guarded, kill him. But be aware that there'll be a big bounty if you're seen."
flightsim,fdd6lf2,t3_ekpg13,1578297069.0,"Well...you were way to fast, final approach was way to steep and you really should deploy the gear earlier so you can focus on your approach and don't need to worry about other stuff in the final seconds."
formula1,fdd631j,t1_fdaaddv,1578296409.0,lol
formula1,fdd5xyr,t1_fda5qpy,1578296233.0,Well it looks like Vips is going off to Super Formula. He did the last race of the season and the official test as well. I'm not really happy about it either but we have to wait and see.
trucksim,fdd5oc1,t1_fdc33xa,1578295891.0,"It starts locking the drive axle, meaning the rear wheels. That's causing the rear to slide and spin if being to aggressive."
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fd0hkxq,t1_fd0gg97,1578118903.0,Yes. They are guarding important places on the maps but only come to life when you start a conflict near them. Otherwise they stay like  normal statues.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fd0fola,t1_fcy3x21,1578118130.0,Only the statues from the fate of atlantis dlc ;)
assassinscreed,fd0dzpt,t1_fcysrae,1578117469.0,Yeah and the funny thing is that the whole franchise would've worked just as well without it.
ACCompetizione,fcy62b7,t1_fcy26gk,1578075283.0,"Yeah I don't know they must be blind or something. Or maybe they want him to be the bad guy because stuff like this has happened to them before...who knows lol

Yeah the Porsche is a beast, if you overdo it. Especially when you try to turn under braking."
ACCompetizione,fcxm62q,t1_fcxevcg,1578066268.0,"No need to argue with him, he's biased because he was hit and doesn't want to see it. Pretty obvious that he missed his braking, avoided the car ahead, almost lost it by doing so and ended up on the grass. I mean, he almost had no control until he reached the grass."
oddlysatisfying,fcxlwei,t3_ejfkl5,1578066089.0,Wow first it was only fake. Now it is mirrored and fake! Impressive.
simracing,fcwpcwn,t3_ej8045,1578032504.0,I see you've got some provisions on the left for longer races. Good thinking.
ACCompetizione,fcufaao,t1_fcuf6j3,1577979558.0,Wtf? lol
ACCompetizione,fcudhk9,t3_eizfyc,1577978395.0,Tbh this looks like a mistake and not more. Looks like he missed his braking and tried avoiding the car ahead. Sucks for you but it looks not intentional by any means.
trainsimworld,fcu2mcn,t1_fcu2aac,1577970600.0,"If you're totally sure the brakes are cut in it looks like a bug, yes. Maybe try verifying your steam files as well and try again but if it doesn't do anything send a ticket.  


Again no worries :)"
trainsimworld,fcu21oc,t3_ei54v4,1577969997.0,"Okay I replayed it and for me I had to first set the Isolation Switch to run (right console on the bottom, the switch on the left), then put in the reverser/master keyand take a look at the overhead display for the loco controls. There you have to navigate to ""Brake Cut-Out"" on the bottom right, using the arrow buttons. Then press the ""F3"" button to enter the controls and after that use the ""F2"" button to turn the brakes to ""Cut-In"". After that you have to hold the automatic brake on release until the pointer and the faster moving tip is at 5 bar (big gauge in the middle). Then you have to go back to the screen above your head and press the ""F2"" button again to cut out the brakes and leave the menu by pressing ""F4"". The final move is to remove the reverser/master key again and you should be done. 

&#x200B;

If you follow these steps precisely everything should work as intended. And note that the ""F"" buttons aren't on your keyboard but you have to click them ingame under the screen with your mouse cursor. But I guess you know that :D  


If following the exact steps isn't working I can't help you any more and you might consider it as a bug and send a ticket to the devs. Good luck!"
trainsimworld,fcrsubh,t1_fcrobjf,1577906158.0,No worries :)
trainsimworld,fcro6j8,t1_fcri8kw,1577904383.0,"Hm okay, gotta check later or tomorrow and see if I can figure out what you might've missed or if it's a bug."
trainsimworld,fcqxjvn,t3_ei54v4,1577893725.0,"Maybe the parking brake is still engaged? Also the train has a lab system, sometimes it can take some time to fully release."
trucksim,fcm7f46,t1_fclzyk7,1577766196.0,First number on the grill looks like a 7 so I'd guess it's a 730.
trains,fckxpok,t1_fckvjfn,1577735435.0,"Super, Danke!"
trainsimworld,fckpsvs,t1_fckpgzf,1577730572.0,Can't think of anything else as well really...seems to be a bug. Maybe send a ticket to the devs and try verifying your files.
trainsimworld,fckoxl3,t1_fckor87,1577730036.0,Huh that's really odd. And your PBZ and SIFA were turned off?
trains,fcklf9e,t1_fckjfca,1577727882.0,"Haha nein den Tip kannte ich leider noch nicht. Wo genau liegt das denn? Dann schau ich da mal vorbei, wenn ich das nächste Mal da bin!"
trainsimworld,fcklc59,t3_ehnk4z,1577727829.0,"Usually to reset the DB trains you have to put the throttle to idle, then put the reverser to neutral and back to forward. That should reset the controls. Brakes I'm not sure right now, you'd have to try around if the have to be fully applied or at B2 or at off."
space,fcjy3xu,t1_fcjv7lf,1577710098.0,"Agreed, should be Venus."
aww,fchp0ip,t1_fch9upd,1577652628.0,Definitely two. Look at the shadows.
trainsimworld,fc6tegt,t1_fc6sown,1577489016.0,"That's a good combination to start on, there's something of everything."
trainsimworld,fc6s16z,t1_fc6rrjx,1577488014.0,"Sounds great, have fun! The train itself is fun, I just don't really like the line. It's to straight and urban for my liking but if it doesn't bother you, you'll enjoy it!

&#x200B;

Edit: Talking about the Long Island line, not the one included in the basegame."
ACCompetizione,fc6rtt2,t1_fc6oxvy,1577487865.0,"Hm that's weird, never had that before. Usually when they're behind they won't run into you on throttle. Is there a way for you to make a little clip? Hard to tell what's causing it."
trainsimworld,fc6fzbq,t3_eg14pt,1577479674.0,"Welcome to the ride! Have fun, it's always a great way to relax for me and I hope it'll be for you. One DLC I'd recommend is the newest one (east coastway), it's my favourite line to date. Also the other british ones are good ones, Tees Valley, northern Trans-Penny and Somerset railway. 

But it's all personal preferemnce, I like older diesel engines and small comuters, that's why I like these DLC's."
ACCompetizione,fc6c9lc,t1_fc6c024,1577477207.0,"Ahh okay, is the opponend still next to you? If they try to hold it around the outside, they 'll crash into you because. I'm always doing a switchback, when they stay on the outside.

Or is the car behind you and hits your rear?"
ACCompetizione,fc67cf2,t3_egdvs6,1577473944.0,"Yeah if you're on the inside you can't cut over in the braking zone, they won't move an inch. But if you know it it's fine. In general at Monza it's a huge improvement, it was almost unraceable before the update."
trucksim,fc3f1p4,t3_efvvxt,1577388372.0,It does sound like a capacity issue. Is your harddrive completely filled out? Gpu bottlenecking? Usually if games close after some time it is one of these.
