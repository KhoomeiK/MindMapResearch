FIFA,ff7ta17,t3_es44wv,1579657825.0,Waka waka this one’s for Hazard SBC
FIFA,ff0c2x1,t1_fezi0cu,1579467489.0,I’m with you bud. 30 packs for TOTY and 19 for headliners and one board (Tadic). Freaking brutal.
FIFA,feyae7y,t3_eqthdn,1579442962.0,"With what I’ve seen from VAR this year, shit, that might be a red"
todayilearned,fepheff,t1_fepe7y4,1579320553.0,COMB THE LIVING ROOM!
FIFA,fep6h8r,t3_eq4892,1579313215.0,Saved 18 packs. No walkouts. One board - Tadic. Fuck off.
todayilearned,fem2ki2,t1_fem28gu,1579237666.0,When I saw there was a queue to get on the trains and people actually adhered to it I almost shat.
todayilearned,fem2fgy,t1_fem1f06,1579237536.0,Spot on. There’s a civic pride there that just doesn’t exist here unless there’s a “holy shit” emergency to band people together.
todayilearned,felu2m5,t1_feltqcl,1579230949.0,"Your transition was way worse than mine. Sorry, brotha."
modernwarfare,felq8mh,t3_epqsh3,1579228293.0,Just finished gold on MP5 today and that was more than enough grind for me.
todayilearned,felorz7,t3_epsvd0,1579227280.0,"As a New Yorker, I was floored at the efficiency (and cleanliness) of the public transportation system in Japan."
wallstreetbets,fek1b7i,t1_fejy2w3,1579190482.0,Buying or selling?
FIFA,feh1i1q,t1_fegy6y7,1579107182.0,Still in my starting eleven. Monster.
soccer,fegphyo,t1_fegmkc1,1579099458.0,"Get Hazard to the DR, stat"
FIFA,fe8vnl6,t1_fe8hkwc,1578931536.0,The thunder/lightning combo up top in a 41212 is so much fun. Been playing that way almost exclusively this year.
modernwarfare,fe01lts,t1_fdzucls,1578800817.0,"Seconded. Just give me something I can fucking see, please."
soccer,fdwemby,t1_fdwe647,1578757917.0,"Previous to this season he was reckless, but playable. Now...? Woof."
soccer,fdwcjb9,t1_fdw15ea,1578757332.0,I wouldn’t trust Nico against my grandmother and she’s been dead for 25 years
BrainFog,fdoeqfl,t1_fdnz7ry,1578603737.0,"Thanks friend, stay strong!"
BrainFog,fdnwgcx,t1_fdni6qx,1578594240.0,I feel for you. If I ever get to the root of it I’ll give you a shout.
BrainFog,fdner63,t3_em6dnx,1578584247.0,Thousand percent. I skip letters. Catch letters and words from different lines and insert them in the wrong places. Literally every day. It’s brutal. Still trying to find the cause. Almost like the autocomplete function of my brain is toast.
FIFA,fdmhxxv,t1_fdmdyx1,1578550530.0,Absurd right? Right with you.
soccer,fdlaexu,t1_fdkx3fg,1578519845.0,"I love them all as players. Just not in that position, no."
soccer,fdk7r8a,t1_fdjsuh7,1578498010.0,If Aguero isn’t out there there’s no one else I really trust at the spot. I’d love to have Rashford just for that.
FIFA,fdjeo6r,t3_elhmse,1578467641.0,We’ve been de Frauded
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdjdqhf,t1_fdj2dbt,1578466578.0,What’s funny is I don’t think he really has any values. Everything is about elevating his own status. That’s all he appears to value. The president is supposed to be America’s number one public servant. And yet he somehow seems to make everything about himself.
funny,fdi2lvp,t3_elcfes,1578434622.0,Sometimes my pup pets me back with her paw and nothing else in the world can make me feel quite like that.
FIFA,fddx2vr,t3_ekv461,1578326087.0,I still rock Scream Dzeko in my lineup. He’s so efficient for me. Even with -1* skills.

stocks,fdd2yjn,t1_fdcpp0w,1578292658.0,We went with “fucked old rebuilt Dodge”
MapPorn,fdd24cj,t1_fdcy1yt,1578291744.0,Sic is used in brackets when you’re quoting someone and the quote itself is grammatically incorrect or kinda fucocked. It’s a way for the person writing the article to acknowledge the mistake without losing the integrity of the original quote.
FIFA,fd2xat5,t1_fd1wwb2,1578152589.0,"If I remember correctly, Bernardo had a solid year with Portugal, but as a City fan, no shot he deserves to be in TOTY over KdB, regardless of position. I love Bernardo, but he's taken a step back with us this year. KdB deserves TOTY with some of his passes this year alone."

FIFA,fcwbgzp,t1_fcv02jj,1578021549.0,But it’s rare...
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcrfjw8,t3_eijlf1,1577901166.0,Imagine being that insecure. Exhausting.
FIFA,fcp2o0w,t1_fcp037o,1577848610.0,Well said
tarheels,fcp2h15,t3_eiczlv,1577848439.0,Such a rich history. Tough to encapsulate but I’d recommend reading “To Hate Like This is to be Happy Forever”. Delves into the Dook rivalry mostly but that’s a great place to start.
FIFA,fcn42zx,t3_ei20ia,1577802706.0,2-0 down is exactly where you wanna be.
FIFA,fcj7aop,t3_ehesbh,1577679048.0,Sweet earrings
soccer,fcamdr6,t1_fcacr2p,1577572112.0,Coming in *hot*
funny,fbypkx9,t1_fby7lax,1577222977.0,Seconded. Did this job for a while and that was the ultimate no-no.
soccer,fbvo3zb,t1_fbu16p8,1577133614.0,Pfft can’t be the World Cup if it’s only Chad playing
