offmychest,fdypq2i,t1_fdx42fo,1578782327.0,Unfortunately not really. The south of Australia is being hit by fires badly and there is no rain here yet. Maybe some of it will travel down to us... Fingers crossed!
offmychest,fdypg2s,t1_fdx0q9v,1578782217.0,"I'm not sure who's downvoting, but unfortunately in most of Australia, including the parts currently being hit with fires, we've had no rain."
offmychest,fdyotmy,t1_fdy3ltg,1578782087.0,"The south east coast is where we're being hit hard by fires at the moment. So far, no rain for us (except about 10 minutes a week or so ago)."
ABraThatFits,fdd9waf,t1_fdckvnd,1578301680.0,"I'm a 32 DD, who looks more like a B, maybe C. I went to get a new bra the other day, at a place that is meant to specialise in bra fitting. I told the lady my size (with the disclaimer that I'm aware they look smaller, they just don't project out much), and she had me put on a C and 2 Ds before she said ""they are deceptive, aren't they!"" and started bringing me DDs. I almost think she was annoyed that I was right.

To be fair, the other lady working there did a very good job of fitting my Mum, who has been wearing the wrong size her entire adult life (she's pushing 60). So that is definitely good!"

dataisbeautiful,fczdchb,t1_fcybveg,1578098665.0,"I come from one of the towns in Southern NSW, Moruya. All the towns to the north have been hit really, really hard - especially on new years eve. Further south, same story.

There are fires burning to the north, west, and south of Moruya. Ocean to the east. Lots of people are evacuated to Moruya. I was there over Christmas, and only just made it out while roads were open in the middle of the night on the 30th. My mum drove us out, stayed a night at my place in Wollongong, and drove my sister to Canberra for a flight. She got half way back to my place before having to stop for fire-related road closures. She can't go back home for the same reason. Smoke is really thick in a lot of places. We've had days here where it's even hazy inside a closed building, although it's not as bad here now.

My dad is back in Moruya, where they've now had electricity restored, and some communications. We had a stressful few days of minimal contact, so I'm glad to be able to talk to him now. But many businesses are closed as people defend their homes. Many supplies are running low/out at grocery stores and petrol stations. Fire fighting resources are really stretched - all are warned that resources will not be available to defend many homes, they are focussing only on larger town centres - they just can't do more than that.

Smoke back in Moruya is really thick - you barely see the sun, everything is in a red-orange light, or purple. Solar panels aren't working as there isn't enough light getting through. Dad's been working to be as prepared as possible, wearing an air filtering mask the whole time.

And so far, we're some of the lucky ones."

But with this weather and the number of fires, they're struggling to do even that. That is NOT for lack of efforts though. They've been working so, so hard at this."
pics,fcmfjoi,t1_fcmeobs,1577773386.0,"I'm not 100% sure for this particular place, but many towns around my hometown have indeed had to evacuate to the beaches. Many have been trapped on the beach while everything inland burns. Many towns that are not under immediate threat (i.e. not currently burning) are providing evacuation points, but some of these are without electricity. Phone towers are down, meaning that some people can't make contact with loved ones... It's really fucking scary."
Indiemakeupandmore,faix2jn,t1_faiv15o,1576118679.0,Similar smell if you've ever had some nuts or seeds that have gone rancid... it's a sort of sour/bitter/metallic smell (at least that's how I'd describe it).
