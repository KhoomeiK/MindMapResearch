Yes, exactly. And that small thing drives people insane. I thought it was a lower bar to set and would easily satisfy your doubts that this phenomenon exists. (As an aside, I'd say only Battlefield explicitly fits your definition of canonically male franchise, so I don't know what criterion you're using exactly.) 

All the same, I apologize, I expect what you mean is that females shouldn't be able to market using big, existing franchises the same way that others can, so here are some small, obscure indie games. The point is that female fantasies are not allowed. Female Fantasies are exactly the same as the ""SJW"" agenda, and yes, your game will get fucked.

So yes. Gamers are very scared of new IP with women. They will actively search it for anything that implies that it is a ""female fantasy"" and then proceed with a vested interest in making the game fail. 

Even games without these elements, gamers get extremely scared if they see a female and have to investigate first:

Wonderful game. Very well received. DLC was well received, other DLC wasn't. The other DLC is still sitting at a terrible score even after all the trans-hating comments were curated. Because they added a flag. Do you really think that the inclusion of more elements traditionally aligned with female empowerment will not be maligned and lead to your business failing? It's the same thing as Battletech.

Right, because I'm pro-choice. And this ""you you you"" stuff you keep saying to make yourself feel good proves that the ""criticism fuels us"" part is NOT ""jack shit"". You are doing that right now to fuel yourself. You made things up about what you saw as an enemy just so that you could feel right and safe no matter what you had to say without proof, and what you had to misunderstand. You constructed an other, a subhuman, so that you could feel above them. 

In this case, literally, I think you stopped talking about me and started talking about a metaphor for expediency. There is a word for that, but it's a cliche to say it. 

>I haven't seen you mention how to take care of that unwanted child, or the mother, or maybe how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.""

Despite the fact that I mostly Reddit for fun, [I literally do do that.]  
(https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/edxhj9/this_is_mass_rape_china_slammed_over_program_that/fbm7kcj/) On another account, yesterday I got into an argument with someone who said it's unfair to say ""teach boys not to rape"" as a response to victim-blaming. 

>All I see is someone wrapping themselves in the cloak of 'pro-life' 

If you read, I was actually implying that I held the opposite stance to make it easier to digest, though I didn't think it was right to say either way at the time. 

>and dictating to others what they should and should not do. 

Generally, that's not polite, yes. However, there is absolutely one thing you should not do. 

>""You're anti-choice and you have nothing to offer this world."" 

And that is to say that. ""You're X and worthless"". That is my entire point. That is the ""oppressor's"" mindset. That is how you deny someone's agency. You could have made the same point without resorting to falsehoods and attempts to deny humanity. But it was so easy, wasn't it? It felt too good to not?

So it's 100% correct to say that your enemies (the worthless pro-lifers) are eager and willing to find fuel to use. They'll even make it up, just like we do. 

That does not bode well for either of us, as much as that disgusts you, since our goals seem to be aligned. The point is that if you really cared about this issue, you'd do whatever you could to argue it as effectively as possible. With real considerations for the end goal. The end goal should be to decriminalize abortion! It actually looked like your end goal was to deliver the ""nothing to offer this world"" zinger. 

I'm glad that you tried to make an effective argument at first, but again, it doesn't decisively try to neutralize the moral weight of killing and clearly address what makes something alive. Is it independence? Because there are some people right now that do not fit that criteria. Instead, to any person you're trying to convince, it would look like you're trying to intentionally avoid it since ""life"" is obviously not something we've quantified easily. Unless you're using the scientific definition that includes single cells, which we are obviously not. Autonomy is of course, a fantastic argument, but you have to see that for these worthless pro-lifers it is superseded by the fact that the (hypothetical) murder is also an infringement on autonomy. 

The (worthless) anti-choicer will then probably say: ""You're a murderer and you have nothing to offer this world."" 

Understand that if that happens though, it's bad. That is something we're trying to avoid, as your goal not being achieved will really hurt others. And you won't like that, because then I'd really go around playing the victim card."

TwoXChromosomes,fewk9fg,t1_fewcnqy,1579412463.0,">you honestly never once stopped to think what it would be like to up and become pregnant?

I assume your questions are rhetorical rather than of actual curiosity, but I imagine the thought that came into their head after this was that a pro-choice person never once stopped to consider the life they were about to end and they thus demonized you as a person with no empathy and used many similar words, seated safely in their beliefs. 

And I'm not saying that's right, but it's important to understand that any argument posited has to be able to reach past the stigma of someone who believes that they're ending a life.

To be empathetic also entails understanding how someone can grow to espouse beliefs that you deem ""evil"" (and they very well might be), or else you'll never be able to convince them otherwise. 

If for nothing else, consider doing it to better protect those who you have empathy for.

Xcom,fdscq07,t3_ems2hb,1578699627.0,"Apart from the general idea that the aliens should be much stronger than the humans, I don't think these are too bad. X-Com also doesn't deign to use air support or send more than 4 soldiers at first for gameplay purposes. 

**Protect the Device**: X-Com doesn't really use air support either, so that part at least is equivalent. Secondly, even America doesn't like nuking residential areas when they're trying to occupy it, lest they drive the citizens to murder them. I mean they do sometimes, but they have forces on the ground all the same. 

**Retrieve Item**: I feel like this isn't only an X-Com/alien thing to set countdown timers in case they want to cancel it, but also they don't conceivably WANT to destroy this thing. They only want to do so once they receive word that X-Com has infiltrated the general area and it becomes a necessity, presumably they needed it for something first. 

**Rescue Captured Soldier**: I mean this is a gameplay abstraction. The game could easily put the guards in the cell block instead of outside, and they could add more guards, but at the same time you could send more X-Com operatives. 

**Supply Raid (Original)**: In the first game, Marazuki mentions that the cost of undertaking the invasion itself must have been ""staggering"". We like to view the aliens as invincible and endlessly wealthy because this is what they want us to think, and that is specifically what our lack of information on them is meant to do, but this can't be true. 

1. They cannot equip all Advent with plasma weapons. 

2. They cannot cover the ENTIRE WORLD with aliens, and had to resort to using Advent to do so. Not only is it an entire planet, they may have to occupy other planets, if they don't have to occupy other planets, do you think they were able to successfully space travel/feed every sectoid/muton onto our planet? If not, then they'll be understaffed, if they grew them on the ship then that takes even more resources and time to actually grow an army etc.... The logistics are a nightmare, and they couldn't even afford to keep livestock alive, so that tells you something about how easy it is for the aliens to feed people. 

3. Even the ""Genes/DNA"" therapy/manipulation that the aliens employ is stated to be gated by some kind of resource. Which is crazy, because genes can be expressed simply as information, not as a physical object. This implies that despite their perceived omnipotence, the elders never actually figured out how to alter genes manually, and that they can only use already existing samples and sloppily mix it into organisms. 

This is implied when the elders had to slurrify thousands of humans into a tube and CANNOT easily replace this tube with the research data they got. 

This is also outright stated in Tygan's Stun Lancer Autopsy: 

*It would also demonstrate a degree of ""genetic frugality"" that I would have previously assumed was irrelevant to the aliens, based on the variety of unusual experiments they've conducted.*

1. (Cont.) Advent Burgers. 

2. The black market specifically says that the aliens ""don't let [alloys] go to waste"". 

And so on. This implies that aliens cannot just constantly build ships and use elerium to fly them across the world for all their military shipments. That is specifically what the supplies are probably reserved and needed for. We also have planes that are much faster and easier to defend than trucks/trains, yet we don't use them to transport groceries. 



>not only be incapable of fighting the aliens at all, but would withhold money and resources from the only people who could, instead of giving XCOM whatever the fuck they asked for. 

I mean we simply didn't have enough resources to protect the whole planet, and the countries themselves didn't know that X-COM had a super commander god. They only stopped sending money once X-Com prioritizes another country over them repeatedly, which is reasonable. Why would you pay for someone to never help you specifically?"

Fine, we'll do this. 

Some of the largest stabbings (Wikipedia): 

2014 Kunming 31 killed, 141 wounded.

2016 Sagimahara  19, 26.  

2017 London 8, 48.

2019 Kawasaki  2, 18. 

Overall, seems the practical lethality of a knife/bladed weapon is something around 1 in 5. And the casualties range from 20-170, so not much to generalize about there, right? 

Some of the largest Mass Shootings (U.S. Only): 

2017 Las Vegas 58, 422

2016 Orlando 49, 53

2007 Virginia Tech 32, 17

2012 Sandy Hook 26, 2

2017 Sutherland Springs 26, 20

Overall seems the practical lethality of a firearm is loosely around 1 in 2. 

All of the shootings were committed by one perpetrator. 

Kunming was committed by 8, London by 3 and an automobile, modifying their per-person totals to something around **4, 16 and 3, 16.**


Which leaves Sagimahara as the most lethal and most prolific stabber. 

Sagimihara was done in a nursing home at 2 AM, and while it exceeded the casualties it did not match the lethality of Sandy Hook (**42.2% vs 92.9%**) , which was comparably done on elementary school students. 

Which means except for Sagimihara, the most dangerous mass stabbings all have a casualty rate of about **20/person and a lethality rate of at most around 20%.** 

Every mass murderer is diverse, so leaving out the Las Vegas, we have casualty rates of around 28-102. So we'll settle **for around 50/person and a lethality rate of at least 50%.** in the largest U.S shootings. 

Unfortunately, due to unfair media bias against guns, we have better sorted data for shootings in the U.S than stabbings worldwide, I hope that doesn't offend anyone. 

Of course this leaves out Las Vegas and Sandy Hook. As it turns out, Las Vegas didn't have a high lethality rate. I'd wager this is because he did his shooting from a nice advantageous position where he was only dislodged by suicide after 480 casualties. 

That sure was a lot of time for good guys with guns to respond. But then again, he didn't manage to make as many killing shots as those who chose to proceed at closer ranges, so his position came at a price. 

Note that if any one of these people had been so foolhardy and suspicious that they had triggered security to stalk them before they started shooting, they wouldn't have been nearly as dangerous, with guns or not. 

Also note that despite appearances it actually is very hard to form a terrorist cell. So the most dangerous knife attacks are very hard feats to replicate if you aren't a lone wolf on this list with access to firearms. There is a reason why we switched away from Line Infantry, to trenches, and then finally to smaller fireteams (and mechanized warfare!). It's because once your weapons technology advances far enough, a fight between two armed men starts overwhelmingly favoring the attacker, and will never be ""fair"", and one man can suddenly do what a group of men could without jumping through the hoops of surreptitiously probing his neighbors if they're up for a little bit of mass murder. 

I'd discuss more of the comparisons that can be made between outliers and different factors, (and the use automobiles that's a big one), but rather than convince any one gun proponent using ""facts and logic"", I'd probably just give one of the mass shooters better ideas."
