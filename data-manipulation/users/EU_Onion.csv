SamandTolki,fh9hr8d,t1_fh8padj,1581381615.0,Seriously. Visceral fat kills you the most out of a fat related issues. It literally gets inside of your organs to the point where they change color and consistency.
SamandTolki,fh9h00w,t1_fh8ulah,1581381110.0,Precisely. When you have visceral fat it means your body prioritises putting fat there before anything else. It's the last body fat to go.

Chris seems like kind of guy that takes his time with making his videos, which include timing and pacing as well. If he made video everytime melon has major controversy like now, it would be main theme of his YouTube which I am sure he doesn't want."
