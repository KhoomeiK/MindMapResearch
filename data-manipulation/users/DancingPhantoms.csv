worldnews,fdhbd4d,t1_fdhakj6,1578419336.0,"You didn't state it, but the implication of your comment was as such, because you are defending him in a moment where he is basically indefensible... implying the fact that even when he's clearly in the wrong you will make the claim, that no, he's right anyway for (seemingly invisible reasons). How can i see your point when you don't have one? Trump is only rich because of the loans his father gave him, and the fact that he's a greasy real estate mogul who spits in your hand as he sells and buys properties..... His senility isn't physical but comes in the form of rambling, mental gymnastics, text, and ridiculous speech/thought patterns. Trump always defaults to the same tired arguments of yelling fake news at the opposition regardless of who or what it is, and uses the same exact speech patterns to convey ALL information...... which most of the time comes in the form of directed narratives and monologues about the opposition....and how well the economy is doing or how great of a job he's doing, or how great HE is. also, the economy has only been shooting up for the major stock holders in big corporations (good for them), meanwhile workers wages have stagnated for over 30 years."
worldnews,fdh9sgd,t1_fdh66v7,1578418462.0,"I'm not shunning different opinions, i'm shunning  the notions that everything said against trump is automatically false in some regard. A ""defense"" Which you jumped to in one of your original comments, saying there are falsities present,  even here... where there can be no doubt whatsoever about the nature of the arguments and state of affairs. You instantly jumped to his defense (in this blatantly ignorant and non-comprehensive way), which in turn means to me that you are deluded and foolish. You don't understand what you're even talking about, no less common sense. You are stuck in a deluded loop of defending trump, and thinking like most of his followers. I on the other hand can support some of his arguments and policies (very few), but also completely dislike him as a person and as a whole for the most part because most of what he does and says. which belies the fact that he is nearly senile, unintelligent, and impulsive on almost every front. I'm almost positive you have defended on some occasion one of several dozen of trumps faux pax just to spite the opposition, or to make it seem like you're not in the 'other sides' echo chamber of 'falsities'; a contrarian for contrarian sake fallacy of your own doing."
worldnews,fdh577p,t1_fdh4lr4,1578415631.0,"Right, but the difference is trump supporters are willing to ignore FACTS, for blanket statements and terms in order to support him..... i don't love hating him, you just love ignoring facts.
