assholedesign,ffq6gs1,t1_ffq6de3,1580123070.0,"The $12 deal is probably straight from the restaurant’s regular menu, issue being it’s not cost-effective to deliver such inexpensive orders; I doubt they expect anyone to actually PAY that $38, it’s just there to pad the order to the minimum that makes it economically viable for them to provide the service.

Should the minimum be $50, or maybe $40 or $30? Debatable, depending on delivery range, order volume, etc., but not at all odd to have a minimum."

Instead, you set her up to believe this magic is true, which she will quickly find out is not the case if she talks to literally anyone about it, and then how can she ever trust you again?

This is sooooooo stupid.

Ask_Politics,ffq54mw,t3_euizjs,1580121027.0,"It’s about a 1% chance.

Most likely path I see is the Bolton leak confirming the Parnas audio confirming the Ambassador’s testimony pushing just enough Senators over the line to call for witnesses, then additional Parnas tapes coming out with additional corroborating evidence or a leak of something we haven’t heard of yet that creates enough shock that Republican Senators feel the need to be on the other side of the issue.

So, basically zero chance."
