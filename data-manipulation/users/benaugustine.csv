Having cancer in the same place is actually higher once you've had it. So to simplify this, let's say the odds of getting cancer in a random place is 1/100. In a previous place 1/10. So the odds of you getting two unrelated cancers is 1/10,000. The odds of you getting one form of cancer and then get the same form of cancer is 1/1,000.

My friends are dicks, so they would usually pick a very pretty girl and a very shitty pick up line. I think my favorite was, ""Damn girl, you poop with dat ass?"" I got a two syllable ga-ross in response. 

One of them was ""Did you fall from heaven because your face is fucked up."" It wasn't. She was pretty attractive, and she thought it was hilarious. I ended up drinking with her and her friends for the rest of the night. Didn't seal the deal.

Libertarian,fcyznyz,t1_fcy7uhf,1578090640.0,"Is that true? I feel like I see a lot of posts on here about anti-authority and police state stuff. Republicans are usually pro-spending on police brutality and war hawking. 

Not as common, but I still see posts about social liberty on here too. For example, I think most of the people here are pro drug decriminalization, for gay marriage, and want separation of religion and state.

I think a lot of it comes from left leaning people seeing us agree with anything a Republican would believe and then thinks that means libertarian==conservative. It seems you're missing all the ways we disagree with the average conservative.

That's not to say that there isn't Republicans hiding under the guise of libertarianism, or that they're not present here. I'd definitely be willing to wager more libertarians vote Republican than Democrat. Seems like it's dependent on if the fiscal or social issues are more important. Note: Republicans aren't any less spendy than Democrats.

I dont believe most or even close to half people claiming to be libertarian are actually just Republicans afraid to be called such. Fair warning that *is* speculation, but there seems to be a pretty big dichotomy between libertarians and conservatives."
