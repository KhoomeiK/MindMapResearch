politics,ffg3s4c,t1_ffg3ad0,1579897831.0,"If it were up to me, we'd elect more progressive/democratic socialist minded folks into office, and they'd pass meaningful, strong campaign finance reform, and that'd be a good start in the shortterm"
politics,ffg3jmi,t3_etd79k,1579897687.0,"This group certainly seems to be in love with Schiff.  Those of you who are represented by him, is he as great, honorable, ethical, fair, thoughtful, etc a statesperson in your home/personal experience as he appears to be to us in this context?"
politics,ffg2m4v,t3_etd79k,1579897115.0,"I'm put in the mind of the McCarthy hearings/period and the hysteria of that time contrasted with how we view it now.  I suspect we'll look back at this hearing with historical perspective that aligns much more with the reality as it is being outlined now and folks will marvel at the psychosis of the right.

I just wonder what will have become of the USA in the interim.  I hope we're hitting a rock bottom that we can pull ourselves out of."
politics,ffg217d,t3_etd79k,1579896755.0,"He ""trusts"" those who ""tell him what he wants to hear"" and one of the things he really wants to hear is ""how great he is"""
politics,ffg1nv2,t3_etd79k,1579896525.0,"Does Trump have any idea what a server is, what it does, and how it works?"
politics,fffxyby,t1_fffxhsv,1579894234.0,"If that's how it plays out, my hope is that it will reap benefits as republican senators (perhaps reps as well) suffer ramifications when trying to get reelected ... if so, perhaps that's even better in the long run than convicting Trump.  As long as history and legal consequences for Trump once out of office gets him his due, I'd be okay with it"
politics,fffxl1v,t1_fffx988,1579894006.0,Will be interesting to see how many of the president's men will be willing to do time if unwilling to answer questions that clearly don't fall under executive privilege
politics,fffxdv8,t1_fffwv5e,1579893882.0,"Darn!  I was afraid of that.  That said, along the lines of what another responder said, I would hope that a subpoena signed by a Supreme Court justice would make its way through the court review process relatively quickly"
politics,fffwiso,t1_fffw6d4,1579893343.0,Cool!  Then all the more reason for House to not bother playing Trump's delay game when he directed those supeonaed to defy them.  Having Senate behind new supeonas sounds as if it has potential to expedite the process dramatically.
politics,fffve6c,t3_etd79k,1579892631.0,"One thing I'm not clear on: IF the senate decides to supoena witnesses and then the White House tells those called to defy and it then ends up in the ""courts"" can Justice Roberts just decide the issue as a representative of the Supreme Court\* (not to mention that Trump has gone on the record saying he wants them to testify ... albeit disingenuously) or will it have to go through various courts and appeals?  And, if so, CAN the courts, if they choose to, expedite those decisions down to a matter of days?

\*as much as it seems to make sense, and I like the idea, I assume this is not the case"
politics,fffrspt,t1_fffra1a,1579890402.0,"I see republican side saying essentially that they stipulate to essentially all that dems said and so what, doesn't matter is not impeachable, and we don't care the is all unconstitutional.  Vote for dismissal.  Hopefully enough votes to block that and require witnesses.  THen the Q&A could get quite interesting."
politics,fffrdks,t1_fffr1vd,1579890140.0,"Unfortunately, the bribery is in the form of campaign contributions.  What is needed is meaningful, powerful campaign finance reform"

politics,fffqpu3,t1_fffq6dh,1579889736.0,"Here's my non-scholarly read on it: The US was founded upon religion based principles and is supportive of religious freedom, but does not have an state religion and the government is not allowed to establish a religion.

I'm fine with all of that, but I think we struggle a bit with the religious freedom element."

The_Mueller,fff8z9z,t3_etbknd,1579878676.0,"Any ~~elected official~~  human being should be compelled to vote for impeachment based on this alone ... assuming they'd received the threat either directly from POTUS or someone clearly acting on his behalf.  They should be prepared to end up on that figurative or literal pike if that's what doing the right thing means.

I'd never allow myself to be bullied in that way."
