teslamotors,ffpr2fx,t3_eui04p,1580102697.0,"Costco put on new OEM tires and does rotations. Always ask if they have the Tesla lift mounts and know the lift points. If they do several a week or per day but complain they they are special, you are good. If they complain, give them grief. The key is that they have done them repeatedly."
EverythingScience,ffpqm5z,t3_euecil,1580102274.0,The physics are new? And confirmed? Sounds like an oxymoron. I wish cosmologists would just learn current physics and stop making stuff up.
technews,ffpnaf0,t3_eu62ta,1580099373.0,Can feel they are scared. They are whipping up astronomers who are fully capable of doing digital corrections for satellites.
facepalm,ffm8gay,t3_eu4aty,1580050285.0,And population growth is greatest where death rate is high.
gadgets,ffk9dgq,t3_ets977,1580019110.0,Why? Only the charger side should be required to be USB-C so that the charger may be used with any phone. Cables die so often it does not matter what is o. The other end.
biology,ffk78yy,t3_etu3vq,1580018074.0,"Not only were there different species, there was a continuum between."
TeslaModel3,ffk72lb,t3_etxmkj,1580017960.0,Better have that checked out. Romex should not be in conduit. Especially plastic conduit. I would have that removed and install a 14-50 outlet with AWG wire. Have it permitted and installed by a licensed electrician.
plasmacosmology,ffiv3t3,t3_etutrf,1579983455.0,The only way to understand general relativity is to study and apply it. It is not intuitive. Common sense comes from building up intuition.
technology,ffg38oj,t3_et9uyu,1579897500.0,Just buy internet service and cut everything else. Don’t even try the modem.
TeslaModel3,ffg34fa,t3_eteesa,1579897428.0,"I wouldn’t worry about any repairs like this. Repainting is much more of a concern to me than a motor replacement. Depending upon the loan situation, I may hold off on purchase until repaired."
teslamotors,ffg2mky,t3_etcqso,1579897123.0,"But Tesla is using Panasonic, LG, CATL for batteries. Grohmann wasn’t making batteries. It was custom automation work."
Starlink,ffg1ui5,t3_etadx0,1579896640.0,"If there is weather dependent reception, I would suspect SpaceX will offer a larger antenna with additional gain. But have to wait and see."
politics,ffe9vf4,t3_et36o3,1579840730.0,"Oil oil oil... Buy a Tesla, enjoy driving so much more, and we can leave Saudi Arabia to its own. We could save so much money by pulling out of the Middle East ind not spending money on oil."
technology,ffe8v7x,t3_et33yu,1579839890.0,"Yep, take this seriously. But screw everyone else."
mildlyinfuriating,ffe8orq,t3_et2lnm,1579839743.0,Don’t lend to me. I did that all the time. Never thought they would notice. Very odd isn’t it.
