politics,ffvsyrr,t3_evgu4x,1580272360.0,"538 was always really precise with their predictions in 2026, that is to say that they were always precisely predicting the opposite of what would happen without fail"
AskReddit,ffragqe,t3_eurpry,1580153974.0,"The people that died along side weren’t really public figures. If a train crashes and you mourn the people that died in that crash that you knew personally, you aren’t negating the value of other victims, you’re just openly grieving the people that were actually a part of your life. Beyond that, given the relatively private lives led by the other people on board I’m sure it would add to the shock of having lost them to their families to have their names and faces suddenly thrust into a national spotlight."
