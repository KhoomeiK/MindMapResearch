AskReddit,ff8i1b8,t3_es59kl,1579679414.0,"One of my grandmother's was a tad bit of a racist a fossilized bigot really. She did not like Asian people and often referred to them as 'two faced' and that they never showed you who they really were.

Young, stupid and naive me thought this meant that they actually had a second face on the back of their heads. So if I saw a person of Asian ethnicity I would look at the back of their head to see if I could see their second face thru their hair."

Later she married again and nothing was ever said, she had 4 sons and 1 daughter.
