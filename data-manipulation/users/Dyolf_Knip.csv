> Last year, according to the Institute for Justice, the Treasury and Justice departments deposited more than $5 billion into their respective asset forfeiture funds. That same year, the FBI reports that burglary losses topped out at $3.5 billion.

Note that that apparently is just federal forfeitures.  Doesn't include state and local ones, which are likely significant, but of course we can't know for certain because cops don't bother to publicize details about it, any more than they bother to keep track of how many people they kill.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/03/04/the-12-key-highlights-from-the-dojs-scathing-ferguson-report/

> the Justice Department has issued a searing report into policing and court practices in the Missouri city. Investigators determined that in “nearly every aspect of Ferguson’s law enforcement system,” African Americans are impacted a severely disproportionate amount. The report included racist e-mails sent by police and municipal court supervisors, repeated examples of bias in law enforcement and **a system that seemed built upon using arrest warrants to squeeze money out of residents**."
videos,ffejk27,t1_ffcc222,1579850645.0,"First: police spend less time learning their trade than hair stylists do. The process of becoming a cop should be more like becoming a social worker with a minor in pre-Law, with extra courses in medical training, and also incidentally some self-defense. It should be reserved for the best and brightest. Instead they're gleefully scraping the bottom of the barrel and giving them the 6-month mercenary shake & bake, with special emphasis on how to lie in court and beat people without leaving visible marks.

Second: occupational insurance. Cops routinely rack up 6 or 7-digit lawsuits for their actions, the city or state is forced to pay it, and they just go back to work. There are towns that have had to pass special taxes just to pay for a single cop's actions. Would you keep your job if you cost your employer a half million dollars and forced them to noticeably raise their prices for absolutely no other reason than because you couldn't control your temper? Require cops to get their own insurance like so many other professions do. They screw up too often or too badly, they render themselves uninsurable and thus unemployable.

Third: dedicated prosecutors. Cops and prosecutors have a very incestuous relationship. More than a few DAs have told how police make it abundantly clear that they were not to prosecute cops at all. If they did, then cops would start flubbing all their other cases, and/or run smear campaigns against them in any future elections. So in order to avoid this blatant conflict of interest, every state needs to have a couple of prosecutors whose only job is putting criminal cops behind bars. God knows there's no shortage of work for them.

Fourth: Civilian oversight. ""We investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong"". That's pretty much every IA report ever. Cops are not capable of policing themselves, and letting them try makes a mockery of the word. Police need to be held accountable to civilian boards with actual power. Not to make suggestions or recommendations, but to discipline and fire officers in particular and dictate police operations in general. Cops have utterly lost all credibility when it comes to deciding what constitutes ""good police work"".

Fifth: None of this ""Officer's Bill of Rights"" or cushy union agreements bullshit. Did you know that pretty much every time a cop kills someone, they get to just go straight home? They are explicitly protected from any sort of questioning for days, during which time they and every other cop get to talk about what sort of story they are going to present. It's truly impressive how often multiple police will somehow all tell the same story, which then gets shown up as 100% lies when video comes out.

Sixth: Absolutely no policing for profit. Cops work for their paycheck, and that's fucking it. Police departments get funded by government budgets, and that's fucking it. They do not get to mug people on the streets and take the cash from their wallets. They do not get to steal people's cars and houses. They do not get to commit naked highway robbery, no matter what they want to call it. They do not get to ask ""Without stealing from the public, why should we do our jobs?""

Seventh: Rules of engagement. Cops want to play soldier, then they can play by the same rules. Right now, American cops have more freedom to shoot people walking the streets than American soldiers do overseas in war zones. Cops routinely assault and kill people for no other reason than ""I was scared"" or ""I had a tip from someone I pay to give me tips"", and every other cop nods their head and thinks that's just peachy. It's not. It's fucking insane. If there is no weapon, if there is no actual threat, then there is no grounds for violence just to put a cop's mind at ease. For violations of these RoE, see #3.

No more no-knock raids. No more war on drugs (and no, police are not merely innocent bystanders and helpless enforcers of legislative will. they are one of the strongest lobbying groups keeping the drug war going, because they profit immensely from it). Heavily reward whistleblowers among cops, and heavily punish the ones who turn a blind eye toward misconduct.

And on a related note, though it can't be laid at the feet of police, cash bail and plea deals need to go. They encourage all sorts of horribly perverse incentives in the legal system, forcing literally millions of people to choose between admitting nonexistent guilt or getting their lives back."
