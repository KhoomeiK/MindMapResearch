I was an alcoholic, a jackass, and overall a pretty fake and shitty person. Pretty much everyone I knew except my immediate family cut me out completely. I spent a lot of time in therapy and counseling, discovered a lot of stuff about myself, and moved across the country to start a new life.

I can honestly say I'm much different (and I think better) now. I feel like I know much more about who I am now. I live a much quieter life, completely sober. Slowly starting to make new friends and build new relationships, now that I feel I can trust myself to do so. Still miss my old friends every day though."

AskReddit,ff4gqep,t3_erhu3x,1579563208.0,"I had died. 

The dream started with some weird post-apocalyptic setting. I was with my family, we had entered into a Subway station to loot for supplies. I was with my mom, but she was in a different room. All of the sudden there's two people infront of me, guns pointed. It took me about 3 seconds to realize that I was going to get shot, I was probably going to die, and that was just going to be that. 

So it happens. I don't feel any pain, just kind of that weird empty feeling you get when you donate blood. I got colder, not uncomfortably so, just noticeably colder. My eyes were closed, and I suddenly felt like I was being pulled. Not in any direction, just moving with some friction against me, which got greater and greater, all while this rushing noise got louder and louder. I just remember not being scared. Whatever was going was just alright. 

Next thing I know, I wake up in a green field. I feel truly content with everything. A man comes up to me, says he's so glad I was finally there. He said he'd answer all my questions but first I needed to go meet some people. I walked a bit with him and then all the sudden I see every dog I've ever had (all german shepherds). They came running up to me, jumping all around. We laughed and cuddled and hugged for a bit. The man said ""come and find me when you're ready, and I'll tell you everything"". 

I started walking away with my dogs and then I woke up. Horribly depressed. It was like I had visited heaven and then got plopped back down on earth, forced to live in the memory of perfection. It took me over a week to feel better after that one."

Why do you want to get it out of pocket? Are you entry level?
