You're allowed your opinion :) the whole wedding is pretty mismatched and we wanted to keep costs down by letting the lads use tan/khaki pants that they already own.

AskReddit,fewhnuu,t1_feuirkw,1579410751.0,"I had something kind of similar happen...On like a Friday I had gone to bed. In my dream, I was in the backseat of a car that someone else was driving, and next to me was a childhood friend (we were close growing up, but she was a few grades older than me. Hadn't really talked to her in years)... We were both texting/messing around on our phones (as you do) and at one point I put my phone down and look at her and she's just texting away with boths hands.

I make the comment, ""Really?"" with a raised eyebrow and she sheepishly tucked the phone under her leg. Then she looks out the window, then back at me and says,""Don't worry, I'm gonna be okay""... then she turns back to the window and kind of gets absorbed by a bright light.

Saturday morning, my mom comes to tell me that friend was in a car accident and didn't make it. She was texting while driving."

The stuff in the lower back on the skull, the brain stem, is where the important, basic keep-you-alive stuff is- heartbeat, hormones, internal processes, etc... a gun to the upper back roof of the mouth is most likely to kill you quickest, a bullet through the temple is more likely to be survivable."

weddingplanning,fea1jz6,t3_eo8igy,1578943382.0,"I'm doing my own makeup. After much research, I'm going with the Laura Mercier Flawless Fusion Ultra-Longwear Foundation.

In my testing, I've found it to be pretty good for day long wear. You should also consider picking up a good primer that works well on your skin. Id recommend trying First Aid Beauty Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer or Glossier Priming Moisturizer (in place of your normal moisturizer) OR Too Faced Primed and Peachy (on top of your normal moisturizer).

You should also ask your artist which setting powder she uses (and ask if it has fragrance in it as an ingredient)- in my experience, fragrant setting powder can become itchy after awhile and that'll make it hard to stop touching your face."
weddingplanning,fe9zoou,t3_eo8l93,1578942893.0,"A simple ""This is very pretty but doesnt match what I had in mind"" should be enough. Maybe offer a bit more constructive direction in what they should look for? 

For example, I told my bridesmaids to pick any short dress with lace on it (from Azazie) in any of my 3 pre-chosen colors. It worked out well because they were able to pick the style/color that they wanted while also all semi-mis-matching each other. Azazie is also great because they're relatively affordable and not terribly scandalous!"

Strapless beaded lace mermaid silhouette with a train, selling for $300

This dress was originally $1400 and I managed to get it at a consignment shop for $475 - It has a few small blemishes (a small rip and a small stain on the inside) that were there when I bought it. It has a zipper back with button details. I don't think it has been altered.

The reason I am looking to sell is because it no longer fits the vision/vibe I have for my wedding - otherwise it is a lovely dress! I'm hoping to get $300 for it, and I will ship it with the dress bag I bought it with. I'm in the Minneapolis/St.Paul area if there are any local brides. Please see the link for more pictures - I'd be happy to live facetime the dress if you'd like to see it ""in person"" beforehand."

I guess it wouldnt be that hard,  because even if someone was a deserter,  and their home was just on the other side of those mountains (past the edge of the park),  their whole sequence would be them not making it home. 

but you're right, how do you make the park seem huge if they can easily hop in a Jeep and drive 100+ miles a day?

Porn that shows the woman also getting taken care of, slower tempo mixed in with the fast stuff, a bit more passionate... It helped him visualize it better.
