changemyview,ffptg6k,t3_euguua,1580105068.0,"I'm apprehensive to chime in, as I don't want to be an apologist for rape, or tell you that you ought to forgive someone just because they died unexpectedly, but this thread and similar posts (which I completely expected to happen) have got me thinking about motives in sexual assaults.  It seems like professional athletes, as a population, have an inordinate amount of dudes suspected of sexual violence at some point in their lives.  Why is this profession so inviting to rapey men?  


I always hear the explanation that rape is usually an act of dominance for a rapist, that it isn't even really about a sexual attraction to a specific woman.  That it's more the dominant act that makes the rapist horny, not tits and ass.  Clearly I'm not a criminal psychologist, this is the best I can explain how I've come to understand the mindset of a rapist.

&#x200B;

But with so many athletes always being accused, from pros down to high school, I wonder if their criminal pathology isn't something more like a warped, inflated ego than some dominance kink.  The idea that they get whatever they want, the rules of society don't apply to them because, sadly, most often they don't.  We give star athletes preferential treatment from high school onward.  They get to skip class, have crowds of people hysterically cheering for them, get called heros for fuck's sake.  Also, and feel free to debate this as all you want, but women flock to these dudes.  They don't live the sexually humbling life of the average dude.  I imagine hardly, if ever, dealing with rejection could really go to someone's head and make them kinda deaf to a woman's protests.  

&#x200B;

(Also this idea has been on my mind as I recently watched the documentary about Aaron Hernandez, in which they painted him as that typical douchebag-bully star-athlete who takes the cliche of ""star athlete can do anything they want"" to it's demented extreme by flippantly murdering people for no reason and barely trying to conceal it.  But I digress. )

&#x200B;

Statistically, there are certainly some true twisted pervs among the thousands of pro and amatuer athletes.  But I feel like most of these dudes just need a punch in the face, or a hefty lawsuit, or highly publicized, worldwide broadcast, public humiliation of a rape trial that could (and now has) followed every conversation about them to their grave...to gain some humility and perhaps even some empathy and hopefully regret.  

&#x200B;

Of course that might not be of solace to any victim of rape or any sexual assault.  I'm moreso entering this perspective to be considered by the court of public opinion, that is pretty much all of us not \*directly\* affected by his alleged crime.  Like pretty much EVERY famous person with a famous death, his legacy is going to be complicated.   If Kobe's victim wants to spit on his grave I fully feel she has all the right to, and I would support her in doing so.  I don't personally have a ton of hate for the man, though.  To our knowledge he stopped acting that way after the trial, fathered several daughters, and was one of the biggest supporters all around of women's basketball after his retirement from the NBA.  Sooo maybe it's not such a black and white issue.  I think it's the cultural institution of treating athletes like golden gods where they pay no consequence for all the people they run over on their path to stardom that's to blame for most of these crimes."

videos,ffnemo4,t1_ffjjh2b,1580064961.0,"Though it may seem to contradict my initial post, I try not to get too hung up on what ""normal"" people think behind the curtains of their persona.  From my years of being an analytical social weirdo I've concluded that A) there is no such thing as ""normal"" people.  Everyone's actions are influenced by innate motives, whatever they are, and their own learned behaviors and B) there's absolutely no way of knowing what Normal people are actually thinking and that they aren't also just a freak like you.  Making negative assumptions only causes those fears to manifest into outward, annoying (or worse) behavior.  

All the things I've ever felt alien about I've come to realize after the fact that many or all of my peers had the same struggle.  So I move forward operating on that assumption.  An example, everyone at the company picnic feels halfway miserable about it.  You can tell who are the 1 or 2 freaks who are *actually* having a great time.  Everyone else suffers together.  Knowing this allows you to *actually* have an OK time, cuz you're not depressed that you're not having a *great* time."
