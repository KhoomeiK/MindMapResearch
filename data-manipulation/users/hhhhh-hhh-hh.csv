EnglishLearning,ffw8uu5,t3_evdk01,1580289994.0,"RP doesn't sound funny to native speakers, you'll just sound like you're from Hampshire. Don't worry about it.

Edit: The BBC uses RP because it's neutral and easy to understand (look up the Yorkshire dialect if you want to hear the opposite), so it's probably one of the better accents to learn with."
EnglishLearning,ffw8s4m,t3_evk60z,1580289884.0,"Additionally, especially in British English, you'll hear ""elder"" and ""eldest"" instead of ""older"" and ""oldest"", in the context of family members."
EnglishLearning,ffw8q9e,t3_evkj75,1580289806.0,"Almost! It's ""How many cakes (would be/is) enough for him"". You can choose either, but ""would be"" is more formal."

You probably went through at a time when Luton was on high alert for whatever reason, but, especially at smaller airports and ones in countries less concerned about this kind of thing, they can be made to not even go off for a belt buckle."

AskReddit,ffu4jes,t1_fftkdjl,1580234337.0,"Agreed. The moral is ""genocide doesn't matter until a """"pure Aryan boy"""" dies!!!"" Not to mention a lot of the ""wordplay"" doesn't even make sense in German (""Out-with"" and ""I practiced for X years"" come to mind)."
AskReddit,ffu4634,t1_ffu3132,1580234110.0,And should it be the government's job to make sure you're not being selfish? Why not make it illegal to break up with a spouse as well!
AskReddit,ffu3xmz,t1_ffu1aec,1580233962.0,"Of course. But those people would have killed themselves anyway, and in a far less dignified way than a doctor's appointment. Euthanasia being illegal is essentially saying ""you don't get to choose when you die. Trust the government to know when you are allowed to end your life. Or, you could jump in front of a train, traumatise a cleaning crew, and become an example as to why suicide is bad!""."
worldnews,ffsy6dw,t1_ffsgirg,1580197429.0,"In the same way that cancer is very effectively killed by a gun. Unless you enjoy hundred-degree saunas and drinking pure ethanol instead of water, you can't get rid of it with them."

Coronavirus,ffixsaj,t3_esx831,1579985330.0,"It causes severe flu-like symptoms, including pneumonia, which is perfectly survivable if you're healthy. One 36yo man has died from it, but the vast majority has been elderly. If you're healthy and have access to decent healthcare, you should be about as worried about this as about the normal flu."
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffi8eq6,t1_fb5fq5r,1579967758.0,"Liblefts can be traditionalist: I, for one, think capitalism must be stopped from replacing ancient pagan festivals (e.g. Lughnasadh, aka Hallowe'en) with mercantile bastardisations, and also that the authoritarian vehicle that is Christianity should stop trying to impose its morality on a world with thousands of cultures, each one more interesting.

I know it's a pipe dream, but a borderless, post-scarcity world where everyone is free to be a part of a culture not imposed on them from on high, by such traitors as Alban and Patrick, is, in my opinion, the ideal."

No good universities don't want maths for a CS degree (it's about 50% maths, and the rest still requires developed mathematical skills), and software engineering is still very mathematical: look at what games programmers have to do to optimise raytracing."
math,ffacgfa,t1_ff9xiva,1579732272.0,"The Polish cracked the original Enigma, but IIRC their methods stopped working once the Nazis added a component which greatly increased the number of possible configurations, and it was Turing who worked out a way to break the new Enigma, working heavily off the Polish discoveries."
