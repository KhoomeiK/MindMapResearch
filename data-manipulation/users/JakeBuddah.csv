As if Picard was a xenophobic racist like them , no he welcomed and loved new cultures and ideas. The only race i think he even disliked was the Q and that's because Q are dicks like 90% of the time. Also the borg but idk if you can not hate the borg because they will assimilate you."

AskMen,fefbt27,t3_eolsp9,1579052874.0,"Biggest thing I've noticed in being successful with women is having a good sense of humor. Being able to come up with a joke off a couple words they said can go a long way. Also take care of yourself, shower , clean clothes , nice breath , clean face , clothes that fit you well and look good as well. Also being able to cook can be big as well idk how many guys i know that don't know how to cook and be able to make more than spaghetti."
BoJackHorseman,fecl1zd,t3_eo92xz,1578976537.0,This episode and the underwater one are great.

Naruto,fdqidhw,t1_fdqi2da,1578667415.0,True they could have showed us more but then he wouldn't have been as much of a mystery around him. Could have made the show better could have made it worse who knows I just don't like the idea that there's no reason he should be so strong and know so many Jutsu as if he wasn't already talented and he didn't get training from one of the legendary saini.
TheGoodPlace,fdqi2l9,t1_fdp5t8g,1578667203.0,Those good place employees haven't gone through was Kevin and Michael has. They have just been enjoying life in the good place in the good place nothing goes wrong ever they've never even had a small disagreement. Kevin and Michael have been through so much their lives from the bad place have changed in ways they never thought were possible. Their experience is what made them change they weren't able to compromise in the start. The first time the humans figured it out Michael didn't talk with them try to compromise make a deal or anything he just reset them time and time again until after like a million resets he learned to compromise to care. The good place people have none of that experience they're just eating fro-yo and playing with kitties/puppies.

I feel bad that they were taught another person is worse than them simply by the color of their skin. Some of them might have gone on to be good people had they not been taught hate. At the end of the day we are all products of our environment and upbringing. I know it's hard to have compassion for them but we have to understand they are humans and if there's one thing humans can do is change. Spread love not hate.

I doubt the FBI would come kicking in your door over having you MMJ card. As far as employers go they can't really look and see if you have one because I believe it falls under hippa laws, however you can still be turned away from a job offer or even fired from your current if you test positive for it.

weedbiz,fdldygn,t1_fdlcutp,1578521970.0,That's pretty weak tbh I still think you should support legalization because of the b.s. trouble people get into for small amounts for personal use while that might not effect you I know several people who went through so much b.s. for like 4 grams. You can always petition for being able to grow for personal later. It's all your opinion though so you do you mate.

Most people who voted for trump in the deep South have big dumb trucks like that spend thousands on them but live is severe poverty.
