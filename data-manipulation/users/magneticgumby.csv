I love my home state but favoritism and corruption within the judicial system is alarming. In small towns like where I'm from you just don't trust the police in any way. An example,  a friend and I were once helping a girl in an abusive relationship move out of her bf's apt above the deli his family owns. He comes home after his sister (who lived next door) called him to tell him she was leaving. As he's standing there screaming at all of us, I saw a cop car pull up and park around the corner of the deli. I then see the cop standing just around the corner as the man proceeds to threaten to kill me, my friend, and his gf if we don't ""get off his property and quit helping this bitch"". Cop never came around the corner or did a damn thing. Why? They get free food/drinks at the deli and are friends with the family. This is the *worst* but not even remotely the only time I had the pleasure of dealing with the corrupt cops growing up."

Finally, get called up, they found...you ready for this terroristic threat to our great civilization and fabric of our US existence... dried sausages. I had completely forgotten about a small 3 pack of dried sausages I had picked up in France that I had been munching on to save money on meals. They had gotten buried in my bag in a bottom corner. So after I unpacked my bag, had those threats to freedom removed, repacked my bag, I asked the guy about 10x if my bag would make it back on my plane that was leaving (at this point) in about 30m.

gaming,ffb0fd2,t1_ffaygm8,1579748725.0,"While correct to an extent going to politely disagree on some items based on my experiences via my brothers career. I also may be misinterpreting your point, for which I apologise. 

My brother has now worked for three different studios that have gone under due to failed games so maintaining an interest and supporting them keeps the lights on and people employed. Surely they are not seeing direct raises for every extra purchase made (unless extremely rare cases such as Zenga circa Farmville and their handing out of bonuses like candy prior to their massive downsizing) but having people support a game helps keep them employed as the company moves forward with the games additional content or onto other IPs. The massive layoffs at AAA (outside of normal post crunch downsizing) down to small companies going under is directly influenced by the success of a game. 

Again, could be missing your point or also lots of second-hand experience is from smaller studios that he's worked at at not the AAA behemoths."

AskReddit,ffat5sr,t1_ffafivm,1579743897.0,"Worked at Blockbuster circa 2007/2008. At that time Netflix was growing...fast and I realized Blockbuster was doomed when we'd get those weekly ""messages from the President"" or whatever they were. Their #1 concern was Redbox. No mention of Netflix. I knew then that they were focusing on the wrong enemy (at the time Redbox wasn't even in ours and a lot of surrounding areas but Netflix delivered right to our ruralish area) and it was only a matter of time. By the time that Blockbuster Total came out, I knew it was the thrashing of a dying creature.

Whether it be D&D specific things like the BehindtheScreen subreddit, books, general blogs or articles, YouTube videos, or more generalized stuff like two guys talking in a subway, take in the world. Points of inspiration or things overheard whether they be D&D related or not can prove incredibly beneficial when DMing.

Those random things you overheard two people say at a restaurant becomes the dialogue when your players want to know what two random people in a bar are talking about.

Stumped on how to handle players dogpiling on ability checks? Matt Collville literally posted a YouTube video on this today.

My point is, as a DM there are going to be a ton of moments you have to pull something out of your ass spontaneously and the world around you is a great place for references that many pass up.

Like any ""fan base"" there's always the toxic element that just ruins it for most. People build up expectations and hopes and when you have something that became as large as Star Wars with the massive size of the expanded universe from many talented authors, that just makes those hopes even higher. 

I also don't think Lucas is blameless though. New Hope was the product of him filtering his new idea through fellow creatives and the result was a good movie. The prequels were the result of full-on Lucas without filtration and they're hot garbage. That hot garbage just fueled the fires of Star Wars zealots who will always hate anything ""new"" since that prequel trilogy left such a sour taste.
