9 years ago I bought a house for $450k, putting down 20%. 6 years later, the house appraised at about 40% more. I refinanced, essentially taking a higher mortgage and pocketing the difference (around $70k). My loan payment is now around $500 higher.

I used the money to buy an investment property in a neighboring state, which nets me around $2,500 each month after all expenses.

Wealth begets wealth. The easiest way to make a million dollars is to have 10 million to invest. This means that allowing people to be born rich leads, in practice, to the establishment of a wealthy class that everyone else resents.

Also, resources a society - or community - has access to are limited. Allowing one person, or a few people, to amass huge amounts leaves less available for everyone else, lowering happiness, progress, and eventually leading to resentment and civil unrest."

https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*S3Nw2XC1FlJfqKfZtji5eg.jpeg

* This is likely a salvage car that has been rebuilt and titled as such
* This will make it harder for you to sell later, and it will sell for less
* HOWEVER, it will likely drive fine

whatcarshouldIbuy,feo3vqw,t1_feo163v,1579294754.0,"So this is a matter of terminology. The dealership seems to be intentionally trying to confuse you to make a bigger profit, I think.

When a car is totalled in MD, it gets issued a ""salvage title"" by the DMV. It then gets fixed, has to pass the state salvage inspection your dealership mentioned, and if it does, it receives a ""rebuilt title.""

A rebuilt title makes the car legal to drive, but it also is not a clean title. It's a rebuilt one. Every state makes it a point to make this distinction, because a car that's been wrecked (or flooded, or whatever) and repaired is just not the same as a factory car. Maybe cousin Bob can do a better job than Toyota can in their factory. He certainly claims he can. But when you're selling this car 5 years from now, your buyer likely does not know cousin Bob. He doesn't know whether he's a car master or if he half-assed the work to turn a profit. So you buyer won't pay as much for your car with a rebuilt title as what they'd have paid for a clean title.

Regulations below. Bottom line is, don't pay the dealership as much for a rebuilt car as you would for one with a clean title.

If you're unsure, ask them if the car has a clean title or a rebuilt title. If they tell they're the same thing, they're lying to sell their car for a higher price.

It's impossible for a car to have ""a clean title with salvage history"" lol. How does a car dealership not know this?

Answer: they know. They're just hoping you don't. I would move on to another dealership that's honest."

What's life without goals?"

If you've already been bitten (so you need the rabies shots either way), why wouldn't you just grab the thing and squeeze until it's dead? Or grab it by the tail, get a nice spin going (like with a slingshot) and smack it against a building. Or hell, just wring its neck.

Why are people so afraid of a non-poisonous animal that's weighs ONE POUND?"

However misguided the US foreign policy is, the men & women in uniform are professional, good people.

Also - great choice for a username!"

I use zillow rentals, and never have issues finding tenants. The biggest problem is usually picking the right people out of the crowd of applicants."
OculusQuest,fenivq3,t1_fenidca,1579285649.0,I will. Thank you.
