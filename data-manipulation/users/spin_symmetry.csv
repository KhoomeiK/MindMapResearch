unpopularopinion,fdho0mv,t1_fdgg4y0,1578426697.0,"""According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), processed food is defined as any raw agricultural commodity that has been subject to washing, cleaning, milling, cutting, chopping, heating, pasteurizing, blanching, cooking, canning, freezing, drying, dehydrating, mixing, packaging or other procedures that alter the food from its natural state. This may include the addition of other ingredients to the food, such as preservatives, flavors, nutrients and other food additives or substances approved for use in food products, such as salt, sugars and fats. So, by definition, most times we engage in food preparation and cook, we are in fact processing foods.""

"" ""Most food needs to go through some sort of processing for it to even be edible and digestible,"" says Stacey Nelson, a registered dietitian and manager of clinical nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""The minute you cook something, you are processing it.""

Instead of writing off all processed foods, Nelson advises men to start reading food ingredients to assess the item's nutritional value. ""Ignore the marketing claims on the front of the package, flip it over, and go right to the list of ingredients,"" she says. ""

tldr: processing does not necessarily mean unhealthy, if you're unsure, read the nutritional info."

Some geographers think the Indian subcontinent has a better claim to being a continent than Europe due to the sheer size and length of the Himalayas, leading to either an eight-continent system or having Eurasia lumped as a whole and India as the seventh."
