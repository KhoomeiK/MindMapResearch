We had graduated from college two months before.  The majority of guests were our friends and were all used to just cake and punch at the reception."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ff3d80n,t1_ff39rg3,1579538785.0,Exactly.  This is how my wife and I are.  We let the desk know and we don't ask for any compensation.  I tell them I know that if someone else has that room with that issue will raise a fuss and yell about whatever it is.  I'm just trying to help them avoid the upset person later.
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ff209wp,t3_er6dic,1579490381.0,"Good for you.  Happy to hear it was a good day. 
I remember coming to work at the movie theater long ago. The manager and I were both hungover from the same party the night before. 
He let me run box office the first shows while the regular box office person had to do concessions because there was no way I could."

JackReacher,fes6hi9,t3_eqaabj,1579361905.0,"I’m done with Reacher books then. In my experience, someone taking over has made the franchise suck. 

Lawrence Sanders passed and the McNally series went to someone else, they screwed up the characters. 

I tried Threat Vector, a Mr. Clark book from the world of Jack Ryan written by someone other than Tom Clancy and it sucked. 

The first Bourne book written by whoever took over for Ludlum was awful."

I thought it was a contrast of Cy’s vs Al’s prowess for lack of a better word. Al’s got guys who can get shit done, whatever it may be. Cy has a skinny dope addict and an overweight loudmouth."
