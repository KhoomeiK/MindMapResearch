RandomActsofCards,ffeh0r6,t1_ffcj0xn,1579847670.0,"If I may add my two cents... I think that a lack of immediate response, or even any response at all, is no indication of whether someone enjoyed a kind gesture or gift. For example when one is having a really hard/busy/crazy time (as a fair share of the requesters here seem to be), it can be hard to find the motivation/energy to write a thank you. In the case of those who request cards for third parties, they may not know which users' cards were in fact received. 

I definitely know I've received things/kindnesses at some times in my life which I treasured tremendously, but did not thank the givers for, and I sometimes wonder if they thought I didn't appreciate them."

aww,ffaj74c,t1_ffahs15,1579737049.0,"What I'm saying is that rape, child sexual abuse, people being forced to stay with their rapist, and other related issues... are issues in many countries around the world. 

I picked the US as an example, because I guessed that the other user might be from the US. (Apparently I guessed wrong.) I'm not saying that Turkey is a modern country, or that the US isn't (it's not just the southern part, just FYI). 

You're welcome to do further research into the topic of child marriage or sexual abuse in the US (or whatever other countries interest you). I was stunned when I found out about the legal situation. I will say that it doesn't matter what specific background, area, or religion people belong to: if there's no federal law in the US against child marriage, then I'm sure you can agree that the country as a whole doesn't consider this an important enough issue to fix it.

My main point was that it is silly to judge the entire country of Turkey by a bill that is being proposed (and which isn't even law at this point). If that's the path we go down, then we have to at least admit that many other countries have the same problems. But a country is made up of more than just a single issue, and I'm sure there's plenty of good things and good people in Turkey too. The way governments work, we have to guess that this bill was introduced by a few people, that not everyone in Turkey stands behind it, and that it may or may not even pass the legislative process.

However, remembering that this is r/aww, I think that's enough on the topic, at least from me."
aww,ffafmwf,t1_ffaffub,1579734621.0,"I'm not focusing on the wrong part. I'm saying this is an issue in many places, not just Turkey. It's horrible, but Turkey doesn't have a monopoly on it. Sorry for assuming you're from the US. If you think this kind of thing is not a problem in your country, I'd love to hear where you're from. Also, if it's currently a bill, that doesn't mean it will become law. Plenty of stupid stuff gets introduced and never made into law."

aww,ffaetv2,t1_ffaenir,1579734025.0,"Yeah, because 13-year-olds are famous for wanting to marry old men and have sex with them. Or do you buy into the idea that rape in marriage isn't rape? Is it different if you have to marry your rapist before he rapes you, rather than after?"
aww,ffaelx7,t1_ffac5u1,1579733850.0,"Assuming you live in the US, you might find it interesting that many places in the US allow child marriage, to the tune of about 13,000 children (mostly girls) getting married to adults every year.
