Lin Manuel Miranda was asked to leave rehearsals for the Chicago company production of Hamilton. He was trying to make edits and changes during rehearsal. This was after the musical was already award winning, and had been on Broadway for a few weeks, haha.

Be kind and have patience with yourself, and happy writing!"
writing,fcg1yg7,t3_eh5mpw,1577635772.0,"I find that I have to get the story out of me before I go back to edit and re-edit (and re-edit, and re-edit, and re-edit...) If it’s a longer work, I segmented it out into a chunk of chapters or different parts and work on those. 

I recently stumbled across a quote that’s applicable to this situation (forgive me because I don’t remember where it came from) and it goes along these lines: There are no great writers, only great editors. 

If going back to review in the moment gives you anxiety, don’t go back. Go forward. Give yourself time and space to write and create before you delve back into editing. You can sort out all of the details and plot holes later. 

I really hope this helps. Good luck to you!"
