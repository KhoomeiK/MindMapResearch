That said, they held up very well to the test of time and tires, so you could probably find one off of etsy or German eBay for a decent price. They were tough, even my nanos and shuffles are still kicking. But they're obsolete and people don't want them so they sell them for cheap."

books,fd04l77,t1_fcyjpzs,1578113540.0,"Honestly, I was abused a lot as a kid, and I am very forgiving of paedophiles *if* and only if they recognise they *cannot* act on their desires and know that it is wrong, even if they only admit it to be socially wrong whether or not they agree. I mean, sometimes I wanna shoplift or punch somebody but I don't because it's wrong.

Paedophiles should be able to get help, and should feel safe to go and get that help. We cannot say that every sick person is a child molester because they are not. They should be able to go get and help to deal with how they are. Not every psychopath should go to jail unless he hurts somebody and the same is true for people attracted to children. They're not criminals and there's nothing wrong with them if they don't act on those urges. My heart goes out to those of them who are hurting to be the way they are, and I just wish there was a way to help them not hurt kids. It's such a sad affair all around. That said, I don't know where I stand on children in cartoon porn or porn with legal adult actors portraying children. I feel that it will spur on those ideas, and should not be okay, but there's gotta be an outlet and I don't think someone who isn't an expert on sexual behaviour should make that decision. I feel it's best left up to psychologists what the right treatment is.

It's just not fair that I get called an adult by the government and have all the uncool stuff that comes from that- taxes, more taxes, taxes for the taxes, insurance taxes, going to big people jail and war and then some more taxes- but literally nothing else. I can't drink, smoke, rent a hotel or a car or get a loan or a lease very easily... I either am an adult or I'm not. All I'm legally allowed to do now is pay taxes and have sex, and I'm only doing one of those.
