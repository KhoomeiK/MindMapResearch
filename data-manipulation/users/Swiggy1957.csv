My accent, for example, is pretty standard mid-west, but put me around someone that has a ""hard"" accent (Southern US, British, Scot, etc) and the next thing I know, I'm picking up and speaking that accent.

A voice actor is considered versitile if he/she can not only do multiple roles, but make them distinct. Think Mel Blanc, who voiced most of Warner Brothers Cartoon characters, played several roles on radio, and was called the man of a thousand voices. Doohan lent his skills to several characters throughout the original series as well as the animated one. He wasn't the only one. Majel Barrett (Mrs Roddenberry) was originally cast as the first officer, changed to Nurse Chappel and also voiced the ships computer."

todayilearned,ffs9kfs,t1_ffrxorn,1580176468.0,"True, I didn't realize that he was designing this while at the same time doing kid shows (which, being a kid, I watched)  I recall when Barney Clark had his artificial heart, when it was announced, I thought it was an all in one unit in his chest(think my Picard reference): found out the supporting mechanism for it was like 400 pounds. Not as portable as I thought it would be.

Thanks for the clarification on the equipment. When I read the article, I got the impression that the VAD was only used during actual surgery, while, if the transplant were months/years away, they used the artificial heart mech. Like I said, I slept through the entire thing. The only thing I talked with the surgeon about was if the mech valve was better than usuing a pig valve (the reply about having to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of my life, opening me up to infection, was all he had to say: I went with mech) Even after the surgery, because of other complications, I ended up being in an induced coma for 10 days. The dreams were wild, but they took a few months to wear off. It was wonderful not having back pain for that long. (Arthritis in my spine) The craziest thing, a side effect of my surgery, was that it cleared up another problem: Acid Reflux Disease. I suffered from that since it was called colic in babies. 11 years, and it's not reared it's head."
hinamatsuri,ffs7ass,t1_ffrxs3a,1580174896.0,"I won't say most countries do, but I DO know both Japan and the US have them. In the US, middle school can run from 6th to 9th grade (although most middle schools I've seen are just 7th and 8th) and high school runs 9th thru 12th. Japan, I'm not sure, but I believe it covers 7th to 9th grade and high school 10th thru 12th grades. Middle school is for young people just going into puberty and are very aware of it. They know and understand they're growing up and on their way to adulthood. They get a bit offended being called a primary school student because that would be along the line of calling them babies: I know, my youngest granddaughter just started middleschool this year as her sister moved on to High School.

Truthfully, I don't think Hina was old enough to be in middle school: at least, not for another year. It's hard for me to tell a Japanese girl's age just by looking at her. I think Anzu is a year older than Hina, and Mao a year older than Anzu. This is assuming that they had a host mother and not just grown in a tank. Still, they all have the same, pre-puberty body types. Little or no breast development, although hips are just beginning to flare out. After the time skip, it's apparent that they are young women.

Before she was sent to Nitta, I think she got only the bare bones education in the lab: Reading, writing, and maths. I don't think they used the one size fits all teaching method for the girls, as the girls had to actually think to use their powers. Hina shows the most adept at non-regimental learning, as seen in her last show-down with Haru. (a character introduced after the anime aired)"
AskReddit,ffrwncv,t3_euwbep,1580167550.0,"It's my fashion sense! Everything I see as fashionable becomes so. 

This spring, women around the world will be sporting the free-nipple style. Mostly, it will be adopted by large breasted ladies that have something to show off, but more modest bosems will likely remain covered until extreme warm weather arrives, then they will move to the free-nipple style as well. It will actually be due to these brave ladies realizing that they have a fan club of admirers that actually LIKE small breasted women. 

The free-nipple fashion will lead to many women (and some men) to have reconstructive breast surgery to help with their self esteem after they've had a mastectomy. 

By 2055, society will have veered to the social nudity trend, where fashion designers will need to figure out how to make clothing for nudists. In the foreseeable future, it will start as everyone carrying a towel over their shoulder, to use as a seat cover when sitting on a bench or chair."
todayilearned,ffrv7nc,t1_ffrcm7s,1580166586.0,"yeah, but he never patented that."
todayilearned,ffrv6em,t1_ffrl472,1580166563.0,"Winchell held the first patent, and his cohort, Dr. Heimlich, stated that much of the Jarvik 7 had the same principles as Winchel.

>There is some debate as to how much of Winchell's design Dr. Robert Jarvik used in creating Jarvik's artificial heart. Dr. Heimlich states, ""I saw the heart, I saw the patent and I saw the letters. The basic principle used in Winchell's heart and Jarvik's heart is exactly the same.""

>Jarvik denies that any of Winchell's design elements were incorporated into the device he fabricated for humans — the Jarvik-7, which was successfully implanted into Barney Clark in 1982.

While he could have taken Jarvik to court regarding it, something Wiki didn't mention was that Winchell had something of a vested interest in creating an artificial heart. While he was still doing the research on it, he was interviewed by TV Guide in a ""Where are they now"" type of story. Because of his age and celebrity, Columbia almost didn't accept him, thinking it was just a lark by a celeb for publicity. His motivating factor, though, was his dad died of heart disease at an early age. He was in it for the humanitarian reason, similar to Salk and the polio vaccine. 

One thing people forget is that artificial heart technology of today isn't like that in the Star Trek universe. Fans know Piccard has had an artificial heart since his accademy days, and why, but the unit is fully self contained. Today's artificial heart recipients have a small unit implanted in their chest, but it is used as a stopgap method to keep the patient alive until a heart donor matches and a human heart can be implanted. The patient still has several hundred pounds of equipment that is attached to their artificial ticker. This is the main usage difference between the artificial heart and a VAD (ventricular assist device) which is used strictly during the surgery to do the cardiac and pulmonary work of the patient. It's only hooked up for the time needed to do the repairs. (I want to say I was hooked up about 6 hours, but I don't know... I slept through the operation... and the following ten days. I have a mech valve)"
