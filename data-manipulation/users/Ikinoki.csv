Government wise? True. Culture wise Russia is much closer to Europe. In fact you'd barely notice difference between most east European countries and Russia culture wise. Even same proverbs. Blood is thicker than water. Europe is a blood bath and a lot of blood got mixed. And even despite the multiple decades of deliberate destroying of aristocracy, history, religion and culture - Russian culture still closer to European countries than say USA or GB. I'm not saying they are friends or whatever, don't quote me for that but fact is fact. 

> The soviet bloc completely annihilated old alliances. Russia wouldn’t help, they’d probably end up trying to take over Ukraine in the midst of all the chaos knowing the EU would be too busy to stop them. 

Ha, Russia has more to gain by helping Europe and keeping status quo or even returning back to good ol' times of policing Europe at a whistle of anyone, than standing aside. Standing aside not only they will lose strategically but they will lose inside the country as well rising the possibility of break up of the country and eventual civil and wars with USA and China in disarray.

Actually yes. Speculative execution is similar to when your butlers run to prepare everything in the morning when you need only one thing but they don't know which one yet.

Car number plate AI will will say there's a reg plate there and supply it to the database.

At the same time body recognition AI will report a body and a car recognition AI will report nothing.

And then in the the TOP AI parsing the db will construct a person and correlate location, time and everything else it has on you in the database (which includes also cell tower reports, microphone data and hundreds of other sensors, maybe even terahertz transparent body scan sensor or a wifi 3d scanner) and create a temporary profile and correlate it with any other profile. Pretty sure things like gait and hand position will be one of the giveaways or maybe even body scan data. Technically with good enough pros at core dev work you could perform full on surveillance using a few thousand precise 360^o microphones over a city (which is last century tech).
