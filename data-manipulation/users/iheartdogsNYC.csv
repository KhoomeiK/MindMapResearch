SubwayCreatures,ffk36yx,t1_ffk2avi,1580014402.0,I get it. But my punctuation choice is like seeing my cousin’s twin no one knew about. I shared this vid to my family and everyone’s reactions are filled with !!!!!!!!
SubwayCreatures,ffk1cn6,t1_ffjyrmb,1580012806.0,"It’s cool. I’ve just been dealing with it for years it can test one’s patience. I refuse to eat with her. Holidays are always tense and awkward. I used to be sad and sympathetic when I see her move her food around, stick her fingers in her food and lick it instead of actually eating anything. Now that she has a kid, I’m more infuriated. Sometimes it’s hard to separate the  disease from the person."
SubwayCreatures,ffjy7fm,t1_ffjx0v7,1580010220.0,"Well this reads judgmental. Try growing up with someone like a sibling that’s lied about their eating disorder for so many years and then see the same weird quirk in someone random and in public. My cousin is getting help now but similar to addiction, she’s fallen on and off the wagon. It’s not just sad but freaking frustrating and affects us all."
SubwayCreatures,ffjtqfz,t3_etz9cq,1580006695.0,I’m willing to bet she’s got an eating disorder. My anorexic cousin does this!
