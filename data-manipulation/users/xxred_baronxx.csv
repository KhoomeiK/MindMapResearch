Do you think â€œwow! Iâ€™m really being challenged by this, but itâ€™s an enriching experience that I will forever keep with me in my life as I spend my days playing for myself and my family and friendsâ€ or do you think â€œwow! Iâ€™m never going to recoup my costs playing gigs at local bars and clubs at this rate, I better improve soon or this is a waste of time.â€
