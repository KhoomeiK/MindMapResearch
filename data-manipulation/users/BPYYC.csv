The idea was that there is a huge swath of land north of Canadian civilization that could have been developed and doubled Canada’s population. They went to Siberia to do research. The man in charge of this idea believed in a “if you build it, they will come” approach.

Historians argue though this is not true as this land is very undesirable to most people. The only city that has a resemblance of his plans image is fort McMurray. 

The man who had this idea was a respected Air Force pilot and land use lawyer. He was able to get the ears of banks, CEOs, and politicians to hear him out.
