collapse,fer2jnd,t1_fer0y08,1579348904.0,"Well now. I’m not sure ‘rethink your priorities’ is really what you’re looking for here. Turns out, Reddit is extremely low on my priorities. Turns out, I have a multitude of more important ones e.g. college.

So I don’t need to rethink my priorities at all. Nor did I ‘lose my shit’ as I had a good time writing that. It’s not like I was foaming at the mouth, typing away like ‘OH MY GOD WHAT A FUCKING IDIOT’. I was just vibin. I enjoy stirring the pot. If it sounds like I’m actually angry then that’s just a misinterpretation. I’m having the time of my life.

Nothing you can do about it either, you snivelling crybaby."
collapse,feqygd7,t1_feq8rbx,1579347478.0,If this isn’t the lowest effort rebuke I receive today I’ll be disappointed
collapse,fens56z,t1_fenrrvo,1579290021.0,"You’re right of course. I can’t really defend the vitriol so I’ll just have to accept that my gut reaction when something irks me is irrational and rude at best.

Don’t mean to be a bastard about it, I just was so disheartened by seeing this take on a video posted in r/MadeMeSmile that I reacted with more intent than was necessary or called for"
collapse,femwuse,t3_epynpp,1579271700.0,"Something is wrong with you, OP, when you try and put a negative spin on a man celebrating some much needed rainfall.

You make me sick. How about you cut the fucking bullshit for just one second and appreciate that this video is not about the collapse of society? It is about weather cycles. Droughts have happened for millennia, and they have ended with celebrated rainfall for millennia. 

Absolute nonce posting this here, and your title can fucking eat it too. You probably think you’re woke, but most likely you’re just a useless piece of shit."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,femgnjc,t3_epq1dj,1579254539.0,"It looks great, and it’s an amazing idea. I’ll give you that much. But anyone who needs their fucking phone to find a chord might as well not bother. Music is all about creativity and having fun with it. The moment you ask your devices to help you write is the moment you become devoid of credibility. 

I mean, seriously, what kind of fucking misfit can’t find a few chords? How about you just write your own music instead of being such a pussy?

And everyone commenting like “Ah yeah sweet I’mma totally use this”. Absolutely pathetic. You peons ever play a piano or a guitar? They’re literally made so that you can write sequences effortlessly."
