Traveled across the country to help re-establish that state for two weeks because the government didn't care enough to give our people what they needed, a year later I did the same thing again. I'm for the people.
 The last ""paragraph"" on what u said is exactly why I am sad. Why do you think it's okay to raise war instead of alliance? Tell me that u American."

worldnews,fdj92lg,t1_fdj8m4b,1578461984.0,"Check the edit. I'm proud, but embarrassed. Extremely embarrassed when all this war money could go to help OUR people. Idk how old you are. But I grew up in an era of war. I was 8 years old when we went to war with Iraq. And it seems to be non stop since. Besides when Obama was in. We are always trying to flex with our military. Like the cocky D bag in middle school. How about instead. The ""bully"" pays for my lunch ticket. Pays for MY health. Instead of dealing damage with the same power."

I'm sure you're out there using the M4 . STFU.
