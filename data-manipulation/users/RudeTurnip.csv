Bitcoin,ffgfh90,t1_ffgejaz,1579905057.0,"> He's alive and wants her to have access to the money... so yeah, we can assume that. 

Show me in the post where we can conclude that. The only thing we can deduce (not assume) is that she is not an account holder. No one is arguing that it's his money or not. He established the account and set the permissions. And mom doesn't have permission. His property rights must be respected if we're to live in a civil society.

Using that same metaphor, if he made the choice to withhold the private key from mom, she would be in exactly the same pickle.

It's very clear to me: The father obviously has a second family and he wants his favorite wife (not this one) to have access to the funds. And with cryptocurrency, he'll be able to keep HIS MONEY between him and his REAL FAMILY that lives 3 counties over."

Nothing changes whatsoever. No wait, it would be worse with Bitcoin.

The bank has a legal obligation to recognize the father's property rights. As much as the mother feels wronged, this is the same system that protects your money in the bank. That said, the family fucked up...what married couple doesn't have a joint account? The only fact we can glean from this (probably fake) post is the father did not set up a joint checking account. I can't begin to assume why, but we know what we know.

Carrying this over to any cryptocurrency, if the father didn't share the private key with the mother, she would be in *worse* shape because there's not even an option for legal recourse. If mom doesn't have the keys, it's not her coins."
