The fighting didn't start, maybe coincidentally, until Antifa and BLM showed up. I'm guessing that few bytes of data wasn't loaded into any of your software updates."

gtaonline,fe1h7wo,t1_fdtdp49,1578826453.0,"Not ""way"" longer, but they do take a few extra minutes each. Remember that from the northwest corner of Paleto down to the southeast corner of the map is still only a four minute drive in a pest control van... and I ride a maxed out Bati 801."

Did one in the Marshall, which is always fun, did one in the rig with the cow catcher on the front, which is my current favorite, and I can't remember what the first one early this morning was, it all kind of blurred in with the other supplies and sells. I hate getting old."

gtaonline,fe1fyur,t1_fdtwwyz,1578826066.0,"Awww... the little snotnose is posturing by talking about my IQ while simultaneously being unable to comprehend the simple point that you don't know that an Oppressor isn't going to kill you until it's gone and it hasn't, meaning that it's a threat the entire time it's there. The operative word is ""yet"", dipshit."
