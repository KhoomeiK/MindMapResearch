Yes, that's pretty much exactly what it looked like! It started off as this kind of dark spot that you get for a few seconds after you stare into a bright light, but then it started expanding into this shard-like form that you see in the picture until it covered the whole right side of my vision. It scared the shit out of me. I legit thought I was going to die. That was like two years ago and it hasn't happened since. I also was quite sleep deprived and extremely hungover when it happened, so I wonder if it had anything to do with that."
AskReddit,fh1oshz,t1_fh0oyuv,1581219892.0,The same thing happened to me and I literally thought I was having a stroke. Went to the ER and they told me it's called a migraine aura. I'd never had a migraine before that and I didn't know you could get them without having a headache.

I'm just saying that I personally much prefer to play mostly heavies and other low tier characters because I think they are much more fun. I just don't have any respect for high tier players at all. They still have a right to play their boring-ass try-hard combo beasts, if that's what they want to play."

That's nice. I live in a reality where I wipe my ass with gold bars and eat chocolate cake for every meal, but 5'9"" is still the average male height in the US. I get that people who are smaller than you look small to you; an average sized ant looks small to me too, but it's still average sized."
