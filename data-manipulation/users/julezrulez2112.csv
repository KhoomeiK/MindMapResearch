How can you give your heart to someone who doesnt even respect you enough to be civil to your pet!? Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrlll, RUN! Hes going to have to figure out his own shit. 9 months isn't that long to finish a lease. It'll be over before he knows it. You got this!"

relationships,fcyvo12,t3_ejlhqb,1578088083.0,"The dynamic he has with his mother is going to be reflected in the dynamic he has with you. This is the unfortunate truth for you as you mentioned he has a difficult mother. You're not wrong for trying to help him in the way you know how to, but please don't allow for your happiness and self-worth to tank because he can't appreciate your efforts. He's got some growing up to do and it sounds like you are the more mature one in this relationship. If I were you, I'd try to evaluate your reason for staying in an unhappy relationship. Wishing you the best."

depression,fcbqsk4,t1_fcbbij2,1577589944.0,Hang in there <3
depression,fcbqjy1,t3_egxcz7,1577589867.0,I don't know you but I feel your pain. I felt it reading every word you wrote and I honestly can totally relate. It's hard to make people understand the depths of despair that can overcome you but I think it's at least comforting to know you're not the only one suffering. None of us are truly alone in this because there are really so many of us out there feeling this way. I'm sending my love to you. I hope you find some comfort and peace soon. <3
relationships,fbhmybw,t1_fbhlt9n,1576877504.0,That's a great idea. I love animals too. Thank you <3
