SuicideBereavement,ffclutq,t3_esooga,1579802210.0,"First off, 

I am sorry for your loss.
One and a half months ago my twin brother (17) comitted suicide, nobody expected it. Nobody saw it coming. Everybody said ""he, he did what?""

I try to keep my mind focused on the daily stuff, so school/work and in the evening I listen to music, or try to play a game"
SuicideBereavement,ff7732o,t3_er66aw,1579642411.0,"
My twin-brother committed suicide in early december, nobody knew he was struggling with that.

Now we have to live life knowing that that can boil inside a person.

Sending you a virtual hug"
SuicideBereavement,ff18g0x,t1_fei2qqd,1579476274.0,"Thanks,  I'll listen to those songs"
SuicideBereavement,ff18bx5,t1_feikoh2,1579476232.0,"Thanks, I am currently seeing a therapist, and talking a lot with friends"
SuicideBereavement,ff1835w,t1_fekr6n9,1579476142.0,"My therapist said 
""It's like a tumor, when it's there undetected, it grows and sometimes it's too big that you can't do anything about it anymore"" 

And I kind if agree with that. I just find it really hard knowing that he didn't want to talk about it"
SuicideBereavement,ff17e1s,t1_feic6lh,1579476002.0,"Thanks for your message, we think he did not write that much because it came to close to him... as if he couldn't have explained it to us"
SuicideBereavement,ff16z0i,t1_fejq4b5,1579475863.0,"I agree, a month is nothing compared to how long you knew your brother, and I mine. 

I also went to see help at school.... wasn't much inviting either, they just told the usual... 

It happened close by our hometown, so the police were with us within the hour, whilst I was still with friends, wondering what had happened. 

That was hard, but I couldn't imagine what your parents went through in the hotel

I thought it was protocol for the police and the railway to do that stuff, it wasn't unfortunately

 Some songs are indeed difficult to listen to because they have special memories attached to them, I usually try to listen but if it's too much I just walk away.

I still remember it as if it only happened yesterday, its been 1.5 months. And I still haven't conceived it"

My twin brother committed suicide in december, we had to choose his casket 6 hours after we heard... six, the whole funeral was planned in 2 days, and within a week he was in his grave, there are so many choices you need to make and you  get them splashed in the face all at once. 

We could see my brothers body on the same day, which was very unique cause 9/10 cases you don't get to see the body (he stood in front of a train)... his body was... well just not him. There was not much left. His face was OK, and one arm layed outside the blanket... the rest was covered up

In the end I am glad I did it, it helped. I don't remember how bad the state of his body was... I just remember him."

first I would like to congratulate you on your engagement, some distraction in these times sounds good.   

I get by most days,

I've gone back to school. Exams are next week, trying to focus on that, some distraction.  The place where I work, It's both tough to be there. But also quite nice, Cause me and my brother both worked there and in a week or so we would've worked there 2 years together, so most colleagues knew him, and are mourning with me, I find it..... helpful to talk to my colleagues about it. Two of my best friends were with me when I received the news, so I talked to them, and a lot of friends about it. They are great support for me.

  
My parents divorced when I was young, since then we really bonded together (me and my brother and sister) partly because of my step-family they are A\*\*\*. Sometimes I would see him and my sister a lot and sometimes not for days, and now it has been more than a month ago and I start to miss him. 

  
A friend of the family had a kid a week ago so my mom made a card, usually, it would be me&my brother, my sister, my mom. now it was just me, my mom, my sister..... at that point it really hit me... he's gone

we three are all huge fans of the Beatles, at first I thought it would be weird listening to them, but I don't, I find it comforting.

  
Yesterday the police called, they found some belongings of him at the place he stood...... I was so angry, they should've done that the day after, with the first daylight. his glasses were not found, because they didn't look on time. to get to school I need to go along that place.... so I went along there for a few weeks whilst his stuff still layed there...   


My brother wanted to study and later live in Finland, he devoted the better part of 2019 learning the language. The week before, he replaced some major gaming components in his pc. after that he did not game on it.. like he had finished that chapter.....

I don't want/need a therapist yet my parents kind of forced me to go and talk to one... my first appointment is tomorrow (I planned it today) one of the reasons I didn't want to go was because my brother also wanted to talk to a therapist about his problems he had to wait 6 weeks..... and would have had his first appointment last year on the 17th of December. I am not the one that needed help yet I get it immediately.... 

no worries about talking about yourself, it's important that you let that out sometimes. Either to a friend or a stranger on the web, that doesn't matter.  I find it helpful, in a way a connection

Thanks for writing, and I hope you are getting by"

My twin Brother commited suicide one month ago, I saw him at the dinner table that day, he went to work. And then.... 

It's been a month and I still can't believe he's gone.... 

take your time, talk about it"
SuicideWatch,fcz176x,t1_fcz10h3,1578091631.0,"He didn't talk to anyone so we didn't know, and he did not recieve the care he needed, you however can. Please talk to someone"
SuicideWatch,fcyqqr7,t3_ejkctr,1578085134.0,"Reason: 

My brother killed himself last month
He had a future, he had friends, he was just done with life. 

Only he didn't talk about it.

And now my whole family is left broken.

SuicideBereavement,fcx1hdr,t1_fcwglg9,1578047011.0,"This christmas and new years, was something... 

One moment we would be enjoying the evening and the next we'd be talking about it and half of the room would be crying, so it had it's ups and downs on 2nd Christmas day our 3 year old cat had to be taken down so that was devastating

New years I spend with friends, which was fun but sometimes it would get too much. Either what we were talking about or because it would get too crowded. But they all have been very good friends and fully understand If I say ""guys, can we talk about something else"" s

My brother was to himself, 
He didn't speak much to anyone 
He lived gaming and doing stuff on his computer, he was a very caring person.  he did not care about what other people thought of him (for example: one time he went to school with crocs on) he was going to graduate this year and then take a break and go to finland, he was also great at running


It is very hard, I still am in disbelieve and don't get how serious the situation really is... I still don't believe I lost my brother.

I can't imagine losing your only sibling. 
I have another sister and two-step sisters, and a lot of years back a nephew of mine also committed suicide so we have a lot of support from them, I hope you have support from others? Or someone to turn/talk to?"

2 of my best mates where with me when we discovered what he had done, my friends where there for me. But now since a month has gone by and I meet with them every few days, all my friends go back to their normal routine we talk about normal stuff, and what we always do. And sometimes we talk about dark subjects, like death but then I just look at them and say ""guys, not today"" have you tried talking with them about it? or at least say that you're uncomfortable talking about X subject or just let them know that they need to ask you every now and then how are you?"

The thread keeps getting thinner and thinner and how more time passes how more people show up, I just wonder more and more how on earth could he do something awfull like that.

But our entire family, got offered physical help from the ""suicide victims help"" our doctor and school. And if needed within one  day and I thought really we get help within one day but the person struggling with it had to wait 3 months....

For now It's still very unreal for me so I'll have to wait for that to pass and after that I'll have to see if I want any professional help cause ""unlike"" (poor word choice) my brother I talk to my family/friends If I need to. 

I honestly just think to myself ""this is what he wanted, he is happy and that is all I care about"" maybe it is better this way, I don't know he struggled with a lot of things...  
I just hate the fact that I couldn't help him"
