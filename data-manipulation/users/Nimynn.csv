educationalgifs,ffezry4,t1_ffeyld5,1579871620.0,"I'm not saying that. What we call ourselves is probably one of the first things to change, especially considering the ever-changing nature of language.

What I'm saying is that we will always be human because we will be, or be descended from, the first species of hominid to achieve sapience on Earth. Which to me seems to be what being ""human"" is really all about."
educationalgifs,ffezcet,t1_ffexp7r,1579871221.0,"Because contrary to popular belief, Mars isn't actually a planet, it's just a planetoid that happens to be orbiting close to Sol. Early astronomers actually referred to Mars as a so-called ""mega asteroid"". All other Mars-sized bodies that orbit farther away from the sun are referred to as ""planetoids"".

Mars only got to be called a planet because his mom complained to the principal about how the other planets weren't inviting it to their parties, so they upgraded it to planet status on a technicality. None of the other planets were happy about it because Mars is a bit creepy and always says inappropriate stuff about the moons.

MapPorn,ffbqtq5,t1_ffbqmvf,1579779043.0,"But there's way more people living in those places, so surely those areas should 'weigh' more in the process of counting votes.

Ideally every vote should count for 1/x, where x is the total amount of voters. Having it done by area is a stupid system in the first place. I don't think it's fair at all. Why should some people's votes count for more than others just because they live in an area with fewer people in it?"

todayilearned,fek79qi,t1_fek6lwr,1579194079.0,"Well when I first commented it wasn't really a discussion and I definitely didn't approach it like one. This guy had a cool idea about penguins and whales. I had a cool idea about elephants.

I'm pretty sure we both thought about apes (especially considering the popularity of the recent Rise of the Planet of the Apes movies) but it's not so interesting to talk about because it's so obvious and somewhat chewed out

So yes, most of the time I would prefer to talk about things that are unlikely but interesting."
todayilearned,fek62wc,t1_fejojbd,1579193376.0,"Yeah but the idea (at least for me) is more about thinking of a future state of earth ruled by a completely different kind of creature occupying our niche than about what is the mostly likely or easy to imagine.

Apes might be prime candidates to replace us if we ever die off but it's also going to be pretty much the same thing. Boring!

Imagine a city built by technologically advanced elephants. I bet you that every building would be single story because elephants can't climb stairs. Or maybe they would invent elevators much quicker than we did. Who knows? And that's just one tiny facet!

Now imagine a city built by orangutans. Pretty much the same as we have now except more hairy and orange.

I prefer the elephants."

Futurology,fec9xve,t1_fec8osy,1578969286.0,"I have not said the words abortion or forced sterilization once, and neither has anyone else in this comment chain. What are you talking about?

I actually had to go back and reread my last comment because I have no idea where this just came from. Notice I talked about women in developing countries having the CHOICE to have less children because their survival no longer depends on it. Clearly I am also talking about improving living standards."
Futurology,fec7ib1,t1_fec4z5x,1578967992.0,"No one is killing anyone though. We're talking about people not being born, which is not nearly the same as kllling them.

And we don't think that it's better for women in third world countries to have less children because we have some sort of fundamental hatred for human beings, we think it because all the relevant fields of social science agree that having the choice to not have as many children because your survival no longer depends on it actually leads to better and more enriching lives for those involved."

I can't talk about any of those other things because like you say, if they're actually true it would be very hard to disprove. But this particular one isn't like that. Just travel somewhere and find out for yourself."
todayilearned,fdrb7ye,t1_fdqasi4,1578682030.0,"Disagree. I'm a non-native speaker (Dutch) who mostly learned English through various media and not school, and I never struggle with there/their/there or then/than.

I think a big part of it is because my native language is less confusing in this regard (the words don't sound the same like they do in English) so I already had a strong distinction between these concepts before I learned the English words for them.

Another reason why fluent speakers of a second language (who are the ones you notice most) might not make these mistakes is because they are the kind of people who are sensitive to linguistics. Which is what allowed them to become fluent in the first place.

I know that's the case for myself. I'm the same when speaking Dutch and avoid similar mistakes that other native speakers of Dutch tend to make (like 'word' and 'wordt' for my fellow Dutchies out there), because I care about being precise in my language."

quityourbullshit,fddqwnv,t1_fddpbrp,1578321609.0,"The problem isn't the fires getting started, it's them growing massively out of control. Which is caused by lack of rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, which are a result of climate change as far as we can tell.
Even if every single fire was intentionally lit by someone, that would still not mean that the main problem isn't an environmental one."
