insanepeoplefacebook,ffb5ahe,t1_ffb4ojs,1579752171.0,"Appeal to authority is typically considered a fallacy when the person is an authority on something entirely unrelated to the subject matter of the argument.

If a famous and beloved actor endorses toothpaste, this is a fallacious example of appeal to authority. They may be an authority on acting, and perhaps on fame in general due to being a celebrity, but they did not learn specifically about dental care. This does not mean that they are not an authority on *something*, just that they are not one on dentistry.

If a dentist endorses toothpaste, they are relying on their actual dental knowledge and education in order to be sure they know what they are talking about, as that was the *entire purpose* of their education. This appeal to authority is *not* fallacious, since they *are* an authority on the very matter which they are discussing, and as such it is reasonable to expect that they know what they are talking about.

Just because there *is* an ""appeal to authority"" fallacy, which is just the name for the type of fallacy, it does *not* mean that all appeals to authority are fallacious.

My English teachers throughout the years stressed the importance of qualifiers to make sure that an argumentative statement was as accurate as it could be, given that it is accepted in [academic argumentative structure](https://owl.excelsior.edu/argument-and-critical-thinking/organizing-your-argument/organizing-your-argument-toulmin/) that the word ""all"" is implied if no other modifier or qualifier is given.

>The qualifier is essentially the limits to the claim or an understanding that the claim is not true in all situations. Qualifiers add strength to claims because they help the audience understand the author does not expect her or his opinion to be true all of the time or for her or his ideas to work all of the time.

Well, then, you can't equate money to speech, because speech is a right, and money is a means, which makes them different. By saying what they're saying to ""defend"" the Citizens United decision, your debate opponent is just defeating their initial argument, really.

>Another example of response I’ve gotten is “a person who works at a nationally syndicated news publication has more of a means of getting their voice out than I do, and that makes it uneven in the same way money does.”

Again, following their logic, money is a means and is thus allowed to be unequal, as are job opportunities at a news publication just because there may be no positions available, and a college degree in a journalism creates a barrier to entry. Either way, the Citizens United decision cannot be true because free speech is a right, and money is a means to that right, which thus places them in different categories, meaning they cannot be equated. If they're actually meaning to defend the Supreme Court decision, then they are actually working against themselves. If money is a means and not a right, then they are already contradicting the decision."
