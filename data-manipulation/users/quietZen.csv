I've seen tough guys, much tougher than me get horrible injuries from physical work over the years. Those people don't earn as much as pro athletes and can't afford to treat their injuries so they keep on living in pain for the rest of their lives. That's where their hard work got them.

As to your second point I completely disagree. Anyone can train for strength and power and get really good results. That's why you have so many powerlifters with varying genetics all lifting incredible numbers, because they have big strong muscles. A lot of the lighter (not fat) strength athletes and bodybuilders (who don't train for strength but rather hypertrophy) can dunk and sprint close enough to elite levels. Your mom could easily get a good vertical after a couple years of consistent heavy squatting. You're all downplaying the role of muscle size and strength in its ability to produce power and putting muscle insertions and type II fibers on this high pedestal.

sports,fey2ofe,t1_fevd44w,1579439951.0,"I see what's going on here. We're looking at this from 2 different angles. Yes you're right the average Joe with shit genetics will never make it to the top level of any sport no matter how hard he trains. That's why you have athletes and then you have elite athletes who are just better. What I'm saying is the elites don't just have it handed to them, they still have to work their asses off to get to where they are. Look at Melo and LeBron. I watched an hour long video of one of LeBrons workouts years back, then I watched Melos workout that was 15 minutes. LeBron is still a superstar and Melo had trouble getting signed this season."

For some people a quiet mind is easier to achieve. You might be a natural as they say. You could also be training your mind indirectly. Meditation is being present in the moment. Do you play sports or read a lot, or maybe play games that require uninterrupted focus? Anything that puts you in a flow state is a meditation.


The other thing that could be happening is you were sitting there going ""this is easy, my mind is completely blank"" without realising that what just happened is a thought popped up about the meditation itself. Or maybe you were thinking ""am I doing this right? What should I pay attention to? How long do I have to sit here for?"" Those are all thoughts. The mind is an expert at tricking you into thinking that you're not thinking.


Also, thoughts aren't just internal talk, they could be images that pop up, or visual scenarios that play out in your head.


I would say give it another go, even to just satisfy your curiosity and just observe. Not just your mind but also any physical sensations, heat, cold, pain, pleasant tingling sensations, and then observe if any thoughts arise due to those sensations, or if any emotions pop up out of nowhere. It's all about getting to know yourself on a deeper level through this process of observation."

Maybe there were no spikes in the periods you mentioned because back then there weren't nearly 8 billion people on earth and there were nowhere near the amount of factories and powerplants and cars releasing so much shit into the atmosphere.

What I think it could be is this, we are currently experiencing a temperature rise from the natural cycle that happens over tens of thousands of years BUT, that is being helped by all the shit we're pumping out into the atmosphere. So it's like a double whammy. The thing that seems fishy to me is that if it was just that natural temp cycle on its own, temperatures would rise a lot slower.

Chonkers,fdlgywb,t1_fdkjbpf,1578523803.0,"Cats are predators, it's only natural they kill rodents. They are doing what nature intended. Keeping them contained inside is not what nature intended. I fully agree that if you live in a city or in a busy suburb then letting your cat roam free is not a good idea. But if you live on the outskirts of town or in a secluded suburb, let your cats run around a little. No snakes or eagles in my area so my cats are safe, and I'm out in the middle of nowhere so cars are not a problem either."
Chonkers,fdlgklh,t1_fdkj6qg,1578523561.0,"Sure, if you live in the city letting your cat out is a horrible idea. If that is the case though I strongly believe that not even bringing it for a walk every few days is doing the cat more harm than good."

Ahhh, so my cats being more playful, rolling around in the grass and hopping around the place when they're outside has absolutely no meaning here because they don't have a brain and for all they care they can live in a closet for their whole life. Gotcha.

Tell me, why is it universally accepted that all dogs need to be walked daily and if you don't do that you're a bad owner who doesn't care about their dog, but then when it comes to cats you're actually considered the good guy if you don't let your cat out/bring it for a walk?"
Chonkers,fdkexxy,t1_fdjqtrc,1578502433.0,"Uhuh. Tell me then, why do both my cats meow in front of the door to be let out a few times a day? Why do they have fur? Surely they don't need it when all they want to do is spend their lives indoors where it's warm. Why is staring out the window one of their favourite things to do?


Cats, like other animals have their territory. An area they always stay around. Nothing new there. Your argument of them never coming back if they were outside creatures is just ridiculous. They would come back. It's their territory. This is animals 101. They wouldn't just wander around aimlessly for eternity. 

My grandparents have a farm with 4-5 outside cats that never enter the house. Guess what, they didn't just disappear into the sunset, because they have their own territory that they stay in."

self,fdigey7,t1_fdige27,1578442324.0,"Then my grandpa died over the summer and all the hard work I've put in crumbled, although not completely. I was still anxious, but nowhere near as bad as I was at my worst. And I had all the knowledge that I've learned from books and about myself through meditation. 

Before third year started I decided it was time to get help from professionals. This was a very hard thing for me to do as I'm the type of stubborn person that ""can do everything on their own"", and getting help was admitting weakness, even though I clearly needed help for MONTHS and admitting you need help is actually a sign of strength. But your ego will do what it does when you have an anxiety disorder, belittle you whenever it gets the chance. I ended up going on Syrtraline and it honestly did help. I was expecting the typical stereotype of being a zombie and not knowing what's going on but that didn't happen at all. After the initial period of side effects I feel completely normal. What the medication did is shave off just enough of the anxiety (10-20%) to allow me to go to college and face the daily stresses of that. 

Eventually I started doing yoga and that has really dropped my anxiety levels to a minimum. Yoga and meditation don't just calm you down, they teach you. They show you who you really are. I got to know myself through meditation. What I noticed through meditation is that most of my anxiety comes from body tension. And yoga is releasing all that tension. Meditation shows you your thought patterns, and how your body responds to those thought patterns. Or how your mind responds to certain body language, like tensing up. It makes you aware of everything that is going on inside you. And when you know yourself, truly know yourself, you are better equipped to deal with all your shortcomings. For example, I've learned that I tell myself lies about things to make myself feel better, or justify my actions. I honestly would have never imagined that it is possoible to lie to yourself and do so successfully. How crazy is that? Through meditation you develop this brutal honesty with yourself that cuts through all the bullshit.

It would be good if you went to a psychologist, but to be quite honest with you when I went to one she didn't tell me anything I didn't already know because I was obsessed with everything related to the mind and did a lot of research over the past year. However, when she told me how the stress response works and all that stuff, it all just clicked. So even though I knew a lot, it was all jumbled up in my mind and it took a professional to take all those pieces and put them together in a meaningful way.


TL;DR
I managed to do a complete 180 in about 14 months from a complete nervous breakdown by giving my 100% to this goal. Nothing else mattered (although friends and family were not pushed back). What got me out of it? Diving deep into meditation and eventually yoga. Learning breathing techniques that relax the body. Studying up on how the mind works, how the stress response works and all the different ways of dealing with it. Also, exercise, although my biggest progress was made when I was being a lazy fuck not going to the gym, but it's always a good idea to keep in shape. Most important takeaway from this? Anyone can get better. If I could make it from the point of no return, you can too! Don't expect it to be easy, but you HAVE to keep getting up after each fall. Don't lose hope.

I want you to come back here this time next year, look back at all the hard work you've put in to improving yourself and think ""damn, I've come a long way. I'm proud of myself""."

I would say it is mostly the anxiety. I was, and to some degree still am in the same boat. For some fucked up reason it always made me feel better when I heard someone was going through something similar, that I was not the only one suffering trying to do everyday things that shouldn't be a problem to anyone ""normal"". So let me share my story, and I hope my misery, past and present will make you feel better. I will also list what has helped me to get out of each of my... Nervous breakdowns I guess I should call them? 

Before you go on, let me tell you that this is long. If you don't want to read the whole thing that's fine, just skip to part two. Or if you just want to know how I beat my anxiety, skip to part three. Or if you want a REALLY quick glance, TL;DR in second comment. I know, loooong. I explain it all in detail to give you an idea of the absolute hell I was in. If I could make it out of that mess, I 100% believe that you can also make it out of your mess. It is an ongoing battle that I am still fighting to this day, but the further you climb out of the whole the easier it gets to keep climbing.

PART ONE:
Highschool back about 10 years ago, was a normal kid, pretty self-conscious as most teens are. Did some stupid shit that was pretty funny now that I look back at it, but back then it was like the end of the world. Long story short I developed severe social anxiety. Back then I didn't know what it was and my 14 year old self thought the best thing to do was be a ""hard man"" and deal with it. I didn't deal with it. Although I didn't skip school that often, I did have a mild panic attack pretty much everyday before school. Didn't eat breakfast or lunch because the anxiety was so bad and I would pray that I never go up to the board because that just always ended horribly. Same thing if I had to go out with friends, lots of anxiety but at least I could remedy that with ridiculous amounts of alcohol before going out. Just in case you're wondering there are no lessons in this part of the story, I was set on ""dealing with it"" and looking back at it now I definitely shaved some years off because of all the stress that could have been avoided if I just got help from a professional and *WORKED ON GETTING BETTER*. Remember that part, it's a central theme to this whole thing. If I was to leave you with one piece of advice (but I'm feeling generous and won't stop there) then it would be that getting better is damn hard work. You can't just sit there and expect things to get better. But if you work at it you can be damn sure you can get out of it, I can promise you that (more on this in my second breakdown). The thing is, I was terrified of school but was completely fine with friends and family back then, so I could still have a laugh and relax after school. And I smoked a lot of weed. It helped, but also made it worse, probably because I was smoking way too much and I just started getting constant panic attacks when high so I stopped for good. Keep in mind I was smoking everyday for a solid 5 years and on and off for a couple years before that so it took a while to get to the bad point.

Anyway got through school, went to college, failed because I was still smoking so much, tried to get a job, all interviews went pretty bad because I was very anxious, went back home, got one of my friends to put in a good word for me, went to an interview terrified as always but the boss was really nice and gave me a chance. I learned a lot in that job, the anxiety faded because I was around good people. Just to give you an idea of how bad my anxiety was, I wouldn't pick up the phone at work. Don't know why, just couldn't do it.

Ended up quitting that job and got another, this time as a salesman. Now THIS was terrifying. Holy shit this is someone who has crippling social anxiety, getting a job as a salesman. You know what? It was horrible for the first month or so, after that the anxiety mostly went away, I was now talking to customers on the phone and in the shop. Eventually started college for a second time, quit weed and this time was doing good. I didn't directly work on my anxiety here, but eventually I started forcing myself into those situations that I had to get comfortable with, because deep down I knew I had to face my demons, and as much as I didn't like it I knew this was one way to overcome all those stupid fears that have been holding me back for so many years.

PART TWO:
Ok this is where it gets interesting. I started meditating. Honestly it was pretty great. I'm on the quiet side, but after a few months I noticed that I became more open, I actually wanted to go to parties now instead of forcing myself to go, I was meeting new people, having a good time. And then it all crashed and burned.

My therapist told me that it was due to being burned out. College 5 days a week plus study, as I was studying something I really enjoyed so I spent a lot of time at it, drinking twice a week heavily, going to work still drunk/hungover and working weekends. This went on for a solid 8 months. Drugs. Cocaine, MDMA, pills, lots of caffeine to keep me up in work and in college because I was still sleeping off the parties. Doing stupid shit, falling off stairs, damaging my shoulder, chipping a tooth. I could feel the anxiety creeping in again. It all culminated when I was off college for a week. I had a presentation the following week and I just can't do presentations. I have a panic attack with everyone staring at me which just makes it worse. So as I was going about my week, I could feel these surges of anxiety that would come and go. The thing that broke me was this... Before all this I could always go to a friend's house and chill, or go to my room and unwind. I went to a friend's house one night, and the whole time I was there I was fighting off a panic attack. If you paid close attention you could see that I was shaking a bit. This was it. It felt like the anxiety was cornering me. I didn't have a safe space anymore. Nowhere was safe. When I got back home I broke out into the most intense panic attack I've ever had. I honestly thought that was the end. 

After that day it felt like my mind was shattered into a million pieces. The anxiety was constant and very intense. I could no longer get away from it. I could not fall asleep because my whole body and mind were in fight or flight mode all the time, shaking, heartbeat racing. I would spend countless hours on Reddit every night just to keep myself distracted from the devil that was inside my head. I would only get 2-3 hours of sleep per night, and any sleep I did get was broken up by waking up in cold sweats every half hour or so because I was having night terrors. So that was it. That was rock bottom. There was no way out. If I didn't wake up anxious I could catch a glimpse of peace before a wave of anxiety hit my entire body and mind. I was exhausted by it all. That's when the tormentor inside my head decided to sneak in the question:
""Wouldn't it be so much easier if I could just end it all?""

The thought caught me by surprise. But what terrified me is the fact that I didn't think it was a bad idea. It would all just end....


So, am I better now? Fuck yes I am. When I look back at it now I honestly can't believe that I had the strength to go through that. For a while I was convinced there was no way out for me, that I would stay like that forever, or until my heart finally gave out, which I figured wouldn't be long because it was constantly pounding. You know what the amazing thing is? What I described here started roughly 15 months ago, and this time last year I was still very much not OK. This time last year I was in a terrible state, actually.

PART THREE:
So what did I do to get better? A few things. Yoga, meditation and lots of learning about psychology and how the mind works, along with increasing repeated exposure to social situations. Let me break it down.

At first I couldn't meditate because that would just leave me one on one with the tormentor inside my head. That just resulted in a complete panic attack in under a minute. So I had to find something that would not only take my mind off my... Mind, but would also relax me. I found two things. One was exercise. This worked wonders as it melted away the anxiety but it would come back as soon as I stopped. There was a lesson to be learned from that though. The little victories count. Learn to appreciate them and they will help you more than you can ever imagine. Getting a rest from the anxiety for even just 30 minutes while I was running or cycling made all the difference back then. The second thing was gaming. I liked to play games, and although they didn't take my mind completely off the anxiety, they did so just enough for me to manage. The thing is, even though I was in such a horrible state, I still managed to not only pass my second year of college, but I got the best GPA. Although in every exam I was in I had to stop myself from leaving multiple times because I was on the verge of a panic attack. But some relaxation techniques and deep breathing made it manageable.

One thing I learned from my previous breakdown is that time does heal all wounds, although slowly and not completely. After a few months I was able to start meditating without freaking out (although that still happened on a semi-regular basis, but I kept going). The meditation helped a lot, and I was devouring everything I could find about psychology and meditation to figure out how the mind works and how to get better.
Honestly if I didn't have meditation as a tool at my disposal, I'm not sure I would be here telling this story and telling you that it does get better if you work at it."
