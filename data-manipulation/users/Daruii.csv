I get similar lp gain and losses. 35/36lp for 1st and -60lp for 8th. 

Just try super hard not to 8th or 7th. Thats what kills your LP.

This is a comp list from Kurumx showing the best comps and ideal items on each carry. 

https://lolchess.gg/items

This shows all the item recipes and if you hover over an item, it'll tell you what it does. 

Items work on a unit depending on if it's a carry and what damage type it is. Your AP carries want rods and tears, ad carries want swords and bows (depending on which unit/comp you're running). 

AP carries ideally want seraphs (or shojins depending), spell crit, IE for spell crit, rabadons, morello (mostly just for singed carry but is still good) 

AD carries generally want IE (multiple depending on the unit) and RFC (mostly for Olaf and Kha) 

Other items like GA and QSS are pretty good."
