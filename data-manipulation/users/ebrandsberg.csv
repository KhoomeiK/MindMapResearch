This leaches into the environment over time.  A stable plastic pole wouldn't have this issue.  As for melting the plastics to form them, I actually think that it may be mostly counter-productive.  Instead, you want to stretch the plastics in order to align the polymers (http://www.materialseducation.org/educators/matedu-modules/docs/Plastic_STRETCH.pdf) for strength.  Then, the material could be bound into cords and woven into the thicker poles, including recycled metals for rigidity.  The end result could then be baked to melt the outer layers as well as a binder, but this would use far less energy than melting the entire volume of plastic.
