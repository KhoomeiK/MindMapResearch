BurningMan,ffv9ec1,t1_ffutp59,1580258802.0,"https://imgur.com/oLiYBSw.jpg It used to have a stationary tray which kept the wood in place, rather than letting it spin around the sides. If you have a ceiling fan with lights mounted to them, the lights are where the wood would go. And I used the passthrough that used to feed those lights with electricity to supply propane in the conversion. My only regret was never applying powering to the fan motor. I tried for awhile to capture the force of the hot rising gases to cause it to spin, like a turbine. I thought that would be fun and never quite got there. If someone manages to accomplish this please message me"
