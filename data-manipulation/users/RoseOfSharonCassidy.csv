>Maybe at least google before you post a bunch of completely false shit to back up your wrong assertions.

I actually did google beforehand haha, because I was pretty sure but not 100% sure, and [NOAA](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/fish-freeze.html) confirmed that they survive by going to the bottom of the lake.  Some less reputable sources said otherwise, but I believe NOAA."

>What do people think happens to fish when they're in lakes that freeze?

Lakes don't freeze all the way through.  Since water has a unique property of being less dense when frozen, the warmer water sinks to the bottom and fish survive by going deeper.

Fish can't survive turning into icicles.  Some species can survive ice-water because their blood has a lower freezing point than water, but none can survive this type of solid freeze."
ChoosingBeggars,ffxrbsa,t1_ffxoy6v,1580330887.0,"Yeah, most people do tip, although it kind of depends on what service you're getting. If it's just a bath it doesn't matter too much, but for haircuts you should tip.

Also, you should ALWAYS tip if your dog is badly behaved.  Groomers aren't paid hourly, they get a commission of the groom price, so if your dog takes extra time and they can do fewer dogs that day as a result, they're losing money by grooming your dog.  You have to tip in that situation, otherwise you're very likely to be refused service in the future."
