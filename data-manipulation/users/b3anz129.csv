They probably announced MP4 with no real plan and came up with some Other M type looking end product. I'm just guessing that but why announce something by a such a specific name like ""Metroid Prime 4"" without any other info? Except just to appease us fans who adored the first Metroid Prime games.

I think a big part of the problem is that after Other M they've lost in their internal teams and Sakamoto after the last few releases. So they are treading water."
