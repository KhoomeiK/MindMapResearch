AbandonedPorn,feviraa,t1_fevdb9b,1579397891.0,"I see your numbers and I know [median Indiana land prices are about what I said](https://aei.ag/2019/08/19/indiana-farmland-values-fall-for-fifth-straight-year/).  I stated earning yield, meaning dollars of income per acre.  In farming terms, yield does mean bushels per acre which is why I specified earnings yield per acre.  Guess I should have just said earnings per acre.

While I gotta believe the numbers it is hard to see why Oregon land should be worth more than Indiana land especially when the ""earnings"" per acre are smaller.  Guess that is just demand....although farm land sales (at least in Indiana) are word of mouth because it is so much in demand by farmers wishing to extend their holdings."

My experience is in the corn belt though.  Have grown wheat in past for two cropping in the past, but a fair number of farmers don't find it worth the effort or equipment expense.  Those who already have the equipment or who get good write offs will plant wheat for the spring and beans or corn for fall harvest - making for a pretty good earnings yield per acre."
