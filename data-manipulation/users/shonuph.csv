Still have not gotten out of bed."

dogswithjobs,fd25h5l,t1_fd0all1,1578141980.0,Why have a prong collar at all? I feel bad for that dog... you do not care if she is miserable.
ModestDress,fd16mno,t1_fd0vkhv,1578128001.0,I thought the whole point of covering the hair is to not show a feminine feature that might stir desire. Some of the wigs I’ve seen worn look “better” than the real hair the woman has.
dogswithjobs,fd0na7d,t1_fd0h97v,1578121176.0,They actually look kind of resentful. I don’t think she likes being a service dog...or maybe she just doesn’t like her caretaker.
