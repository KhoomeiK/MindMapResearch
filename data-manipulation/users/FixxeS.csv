Lenovo,ffezz5q,t1_ffexype,1579871800.0,"In the manner of companies, telling you they will get back to you is more of being polite than actually it has of meaning.
No company wants you to use the warranty, they need to take care of logistics and it will cost them money.
That's why it's always better to call as it will most likely get agreed to leave the computer somewhere. If you really have to email, it's always best to tell what is your problem as detailed as possible (so bots can't really trigger, forcing a real person to read it), make videos of the problem and tell what you used to troubleshoot the problem or how you tried to solve it (always according to the official support page - you can even link the support page on the email to make sure). This will avoid receiving emails with troubleshooting information and skip right to the problem solving emails, which usually are just 'please send us your computer' emails.

It works like this for every company, not just Lenovo, I had an acer computer with a faulty gpu and same scenario as yours happened, so one day I just called and on the same call they told me to send the computer to a representative, through mail with payment on delivery (so they would pay the shipping)."

You are the first to say the computer needs fixing, so like what? You expect that just because you have premium warranty it's gonna be faster? Not at all, for problems that need spare parts, it's better to always let your computer go to them, for logic reasons:
The representative company of Lenovo most likely won't have a stock of spare parts, so they will have to ask Lenovo to send them spare parts, which takes time, then they will need to add those spare parts to their stock, remove them from stock when they install them to you... Among other things... There's a ton of logistics here that will take time. But, if you send the computer into Lenovo itself, logistics are minimum and it will be much faster.

I can give you my example:

My processor got faulty. Contacted Lenovo said that the computer wasn't booting, gave the information I knew and had. They told me to leave the computer at the nearest representative company, so I did. 2 weeks after the representative called me to go pick up my computer.

By this time your computer could've have been repaired and at home by now. You wouldn't die for not having a computer."
