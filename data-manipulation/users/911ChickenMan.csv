2healthbars,fewgirf,t3_eqm8fr,1579410201.0,"Hi [silverthefox364](/u/silverthefox364), thanks for your submission to /r/2healthbars. Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

* **Your post does not meet the definition of 2healthbars.**

Something is suitable for this sub when it meets the following definition: ""you think you've killed a boss in a video game, but then it starts a new phase with another health bar."" We are about one thing that exists, that thing gets defeated, that thing has a physical or perceived transformation, and that thing, after this reveal/transformation, has a second layer of life (a new health bar). One item, four steps.

Furthermore, a photo of two identical things or items that are ironic/coincidental simply because they are next to, inside, or near each other will not meet this definition. Duplicates/double of the same thing is NOT 2healthbars!


* **We don't allow screenshots.**

No screenshots of articles, notifications, messages, or Reddit posts. No exceptions! This rule includes pictures & video of various electronic screens, other than just on mobile devices, like computers, TVs, and radios.

We have expanded this rule to include non-organic and/or photoshopped pictures, meme-styled photos, and most other pictures with text on them.
