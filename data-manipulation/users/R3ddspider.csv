insaneparents,fezafc5,t1_fez8ydt,1579455333.0,"No we just have conflicting opinions. You may hold your mom above everything or whatever, but some people just cant shove everything aside because their mom wants to go to mormon church. The person has rent to pay, their mom doesnt pay anything for their rent or Bill's, they cant just tell their boss no every sunday or else they might get fired. They're an adult, they have adult things they need to do, not everyone has time to shove for their mom, a good mom respects that their adult child has things they need to do and cannot commit to religion every time. The main thing here is their mom is trying to force them to go to mormon church when the person has completely valid reasons to say they cant go that day. We also know nothing about how the person was raised either, we dont know what kind of mom the person had growing up, was she a bad mom or a good mom? We dont know."
insaneparents,fez7ohz,t1_fez5qvx,1579454538.0,"Wow you're a real piece of work lol, the person is an adult. They can do what they want. Their mom doesnt pay rent, their tuition, etc. A good mom gives their adult kids space to be an adult, not force them to go to whatever mormon church when they have a job to do. Just cause that's their mom doesnt mean they have to shove everything aside to make them happy."

DownvotedToOblivion,fep58yo,t1_fep475w,1579312419.0,"I mean I'm not sure whose being shit, but the original context is the person is asking about if the cab is allowed to take them to a bank without their consent. OP isn't saying they shouldn't have to pay because the card reader in the cab was broke, but that is the cab allowed to drive them to a destination without asking. 

I believe the reason why the comment was downvoted was because it didnt really pertain any legal advice to what OP is asking, and the dude in the comment might be assuming things like OP didnt want to pay because the card reader broke despite having paid the cab driver in cash.

Edit: also apparently the cab driver threatened to call the police on OP (while they were at work?) Bassicaly OP just wants to know can the cab do this and can they force OP (to go to the bank?)"
