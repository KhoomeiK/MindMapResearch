AskMen,ffgygek,t3_etcmuk,1579918298.0,"Dr Who. I used to be a huge fan and loved every episode (even the bad ones), at some point during the Clara era I lost all interest and Dr Who went from something I enjoyed watching and looked forward to, to something I watched out of habit than anything else. Once I realised this I just stopped watching and have had no interest in carrying on at the moment especially given the reviews I've seen of the newest writing."

Darth Deuce was a Happy Lord of the Pets, so strong and so much of a good boi he could use his core muscles to balance and to run around like any other good boi… He had such a knowledge of the balance abilities, he could even keep the ones he cared about from toppling over."

Then on the flick of a switch she comes out meowing like no bodies business and demanded pets and has been about as needy ever since.

Jokes,ff0lla0,t1_fewmagr,1579470028.0,"Yes, he died in the Sachsenhausen cap. He either ran into an electric fence killing himself that way or he was shot by the Germans after running into the fence. As far as I know we're not 100% sure which killed him, the autopsy report states he died of electrocution before he was shot but at that point does it really matter. Apparently after his death Stalin's thoughts on him softened to the point he stated that he was ""a real man"" and ""fate treated him unjustly""."
Jokes,ff0kddn,t1_fewf3fn,1579469691.0,"He also loved his daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva, not sure if that was just a case of her looking like Stalin's wife or it was actual parental love. He at least liked her more than his other children."

I've heard two stories of why he refused, one was Stalin stating ""Just think how many sons ended in camps! Who would swap them for Paulus? Were they worse than Yakov?"", the other Stalin simply says “I will not trade a marshal for a lieutenant.” Either way Stalin hated his son."
