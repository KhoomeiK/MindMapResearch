leaves,ff1lfdx,t3_er52eo,1579481091.0,"Diagnosed bipolar about six months ago after years of going through antidepressants that weren't working and would all start making things worse. All day every day smoker of high test flower and concentrates for roughly the last 17 years. Clean for 19 days now. The first week was terrible, but I really think my mood stabilizer and antipsychotic meds helped tremendously. 

I heard a really good analogy: when we're lost at sea in mental illness, getting tossed around by the waves and nearly drowning, marijuana is like a log we can hold to that saves us. But then the mental health professional boat comes to pick us up, and we try to bring the log with us, the huge, soaked log. It would be much easier for the boat to save us without the log, but we insist on carrying it--it did, after all, save us from drowning, but it's no longer serving us.

Everything I've researched shows that long term frequent smoking is terrible for mental health. It really increases the risk of psychosis. Talk to your doctor openly about quitting. I had my meds adjusted, and it's been a game changer. You're ready, and I believe you can do it. Hang in there, and take care of yourself. You got this."

Interestingly, I feel more awake and alert than when I was throwing back coffee and energy drinks all day, but that took some time. Taking loads of caffeine is playing with fire, IMO. Keep an eye on your moods, and maybe cool it on the booze, too, if you're trying to stay stable."
vegetarian,fewerha,t3_eqrscr,1579409376.0,"First time I came home (from college) as a vegetarian, I was yelled at for not eating my mom's pot roast. My dad called me ""grass eater"" for a few years.

Getting off it has been a trial, but I am hopeful that I will even out and even stabilize without it.
