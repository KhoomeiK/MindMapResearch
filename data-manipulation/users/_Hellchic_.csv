JUSTNOMIL,ffry675,t3_euuhwe,1580168580.0,Why are yall even asking for permission if your mother got you it? What?....
JustNoSO,ffrx4xn,t3_euvmn5,1580167875.0,"Not enough info but here’s a few suggestions :

- I would ask for help in the legal sub in reddit 

- call lawyer/solicitor for advise 

- I would move out immediately 

- record her anytime she claims abuse

- if she makes threats keep calling the police that way there is a paper trail 

- shut down any joint accounts (take half) any personal bank accounts I would go to the bank and explain to them that you need a new account etc and you want to transfer all the money from personal accounts to this new one. 

- if she might apply for credit in your name ring up the major credit companies and explain to them

- tell him to get therapy

- if she hits him or starts being abusive call police, record her and take pictures of injuries"

offmychest,ffrds9t,t1_ffrc4ys,1580156015.0,Its not about just danger. Regardless of things people should not be walking their dogs off leash if they do they need control over their dogs to make sure its not jumping on people. If You're not able to walk your dog in a way that doesn't interfere with others then you shouldn't have a dog it's quite simple. People who do crap like that are the same one's that cry when their dog gets hit by a car because it wasn't leashed. It's irresponsible.
offmychest,ffr9ite,t1_ffr8odc,1580153388.0,"- you’re talking to a psyche student too. 

- it’s obvious that his daughter has issues in regards to the dog however there is a large issue in society where dogs are everywhere, they’re off leash and invade personal spaces. Dogs are and can be dangerous they kill about 50+ people every year. Any dog at any time can bite you. 

- it’s not irrational to not want someone’a pet dog running or jumping at you. Dogs eat their own shit etc it’s gross and if I wanted a dog I would have one. I have a cat  I don’t push my cat into strangers space. If people are at my house my cat is kept away. For some reason there’s a lot of dog owners who think that just because they don’t mind their dog touching them and licking them that everyone should be okay with it"
JUSTNOMIL,ffr91dp,t1_ffr8qqr,1580153090.0,You are fully able to. Dont let anyone else make your life miserable. I cant imagine how hearing stuff like that must make you feel. So gross

Dogfree,ffr2rf8,t1_ffqzc8l,1580149192.0,Exactly. Dogs are like those attention needy people who will want anyone
JUSTNOMIL,ffqyt5e,t3_eupde9,1580146693.0,I wouldn’t move forward with the wedding until you get your so to actually grow some balls otherwise you’re gonna be legally trapped with a man who can’t stand up for you and let’s his mother push you and him around
JUSTNOMIL,ffqyctq,t3_euqhkt,1580146404.0,She knows what she’s doing. Next time she says anything you simply say “ you’re not the mother so shut your mouth and keep your judgments to yourself” that will shut her up. She does this bc she knows you’re not saying anything back. Get your dh to tell her to stop too. Simply say to him if she keeps saying shit I’m going to rip her a new asshole so you might wanna tell her
JUSTNOMIL,ffqy691,t3_euqj75,1580146288.0,I wouldn’t even think about getting married until he’s actually firmed up his spine and cut the cord. Otherwise you’re gonna be trapped legally with a man who puts mommy first
JUSTNOMIL,ffqxvct,t3_euqwkh,1580146098.0,"Definitely now is the time to boundary set 

- I’d tell her right away that if there is any bad behaviour or bullshit she will be out. If she finds out that you’re gonna house her regardless she will pull bullshit.

- I would install cameras on the front door and around the home to make sure she’s not up to any funny business. Also if you do take in sils baby I would imagine she would come over for a bit too (not to stay but to see her kid) in that case she might try to steal stuff or damage shit so this will help with that and she might also blame it on CP.

- the whole payment thing makes me nervous. Is there any way you can draft up a contract or something where she signs it to show that she is legally bound to pay. I would also set up a direct debit payment that automatically takes money from her account and puts it in yours. 

- is she entitled to housing etc? I would imagine she should be entitled to some housing/benefits"

offmychest,ffqw3gd,t1_ffqrghw,1580144964.0,"It's completely logical. 

- if a person started invading my personal space I would tell them off then use physical force the same with a dog.

- dogs still attack/kill people"
offmychest,ffqvunq,t3_euofsg,1580144806.0,I wish people wouldn't let their dogs invade your personal space. You don't see me grabbing my cat and shoving it in strangers face. Keep your dogs to yourself. I'm fully prepared to kick a dog if i need to I'm not taking chances.
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffqtodm,t3_eup0a0,1580143397.0,- tell her to shut the fuck up. Really? Her kids mean nothing but attention. Who the fuck thinks like this. Are you meant to wait until shes done having children and then start? Lmao what a fucking joke.
Dogfree,ffqhd9o,t1_ffqfqgh,1580134633.0,Mine starts purring as soon as he sees me.
Dogfree,ffqhc1a,t1_ffqftvc,1580134605.0,I wonder why he was like that
Dogfree,ffq8tqn,t3_eujieq,1580126277.0,"Cats are better. 

- cat will shit in a box and not all over the floor

- doesn’t require attention all day and night

- is mostly independent 

- meows are cute sounds 

- is not constantly making breathing and slopping noises like dog

- does not need walking

- cat doesn’t invade personal space of strangers"
JUSTNOMIL,ffq8iub,t3_eukyr2,1580125899.0,That’s sick babies have super soft skulls she could have literally killed your child like that. I would press charges and make sure she never got close to the kid
relationship_advice,ffq8ftr,t3_eum18w,1580125793.0,"- she cheated and then she accuses you of ruining her relationship lol. She did that all by herself. 

- then she starts breaking shit in your house? If I’d make her pay for damages.

- she shouldn’t have involved you in this bullshit that’s a scummy thing to do"

JUSTNOMIL,ffozloi,t3_eucqn9,1580083652.0,I think she’s trying to start problems between you and dh and fbil and fsil. To you she’s telling you not to take the attention and to fsil she’s probably saying wow look at her trying to be the centre of attention. She’s probably trying to start a war between both of you. I would have a sit down with fbil and his wife and make sure they’re aware of what’s up because she might try to tell them different. Also would be a good idea to discuss future possible dates for the weddings because mil might try to slip you up and then you avoid the awkwardness off it all

dating_advice,ffoilpt,t3_eubltj,1580078002.0,You made assumptions instead of directly asking and getting an answer. You didn’t define the relationship so you’re not entitled to loyalty etc unfortunately because you didn’t communicate it. He may not even see you as a possible partner just a fwb. I find it crazy that all these dates led to sex yet you haven’t actually defined what you are or what you’re intending to be.
JUSTNOMIL,ffnwn88,t3_eu93vy,1580071707.0,Being a grandma is a PRIVILEGE not an entitlement. Your dh needs to take his head out of his mother's vagina.

- killing yourself isn’t going to help anyone. It will just cause all off your children to have even more issues. Not to mention your husband would be on his own. I would tell your therapist that you are having issues

- you and your husband are equally to blame. What is this nonsense off it’s not his fault. YES IT IS. You are BOTH parents. No one was threatening him he should have done something sooner as you should have.

- I’m glad you’re getting help but what’s all of this woe is me. It looks kind of narcy. Instead of pitying  yourself work on mending the relationships you and your dh have destroyed. Send an apology to all off your children explain to them they don’t have to contact you."

- you need to cut her off completely what she did was so disgusting and abhorrent you need her out of Your lives. What if you do have a child in the future? Is she gonna call cps then too. 

- I'd call the police and explain what happened to them. She's harassing you and making false claims.

- I'd contact lawyers/ solicitors and see what you can do about her for example if you can get a protective order etc.

- dh may need therapy

- please keep this crazy bitch out of your lives. Any information she gets she's going to use it against you. She is trying to ruin your lives."
