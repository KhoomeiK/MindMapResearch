It's the fact that the laws governing our free market are written by greedy people to intentionally be vague and easily bypassed by thier even greedier friends. Unfortunately, we need to publically return to teaching morals across the board, and I don't mean through religion. And morals are not necessairly tied to religion. 

The problem is the bottom 3/4's of society is punished by laws for simply being poor, and we need to do away with that. And it's mostly because of capitalism, and the lack of regulation on it. As you said, not everyone is good by nature, and that's part of the animal in us. One of our natural instincts is the need to establish and control territory and the resources in it. This now is effectivly done with money, which also provides for our need for food, water, and shelter, and even the ability to mate or simply have sex. Money is power, and that power is being exceedingly abused not only by those who have it, but our own government who's lifestyles are dependent upon thier paychecks from taxpayers. And it's pretty easy for lawmakers to make laws that can easily be exploited to embezzel even more of that money from taxpayers so they may have an even more lavish lifestyle.

I'm not saying that capitalism is completely bad. It is the best way to generate wealth, but only if we regulate it to ensure people are not being exploited by others to make that wealth. There is no reason 1% of the people need 94% of the wealth of a nation. Quite simply, capitalism has gotten out of hand. But I'll be the first to say it's a far cry better than communism, though we could learn a few things from it, and use it to fix the problem by regulating necessities like food, water, and housing, health care and insurance, and letting everything else go like it is."

The only excuse is being sick and having a letter excusing you from the doctor who is normally a military doctor. You are also expected to call your work center supervisor or platoon leader and let them know if you're going to be late, or you will find yourself doing extra duty because you were late.
