gaming,ffxmnhj,t1_ffxlnn7,1580328228.0,"Yeah definitely different times. I guess my disappointment was that nobody knew what we were supposed to do since that GameStop was not open. I feel like if you're temporarily closing a store you could at least send customers an email or advise the nearest open GameStop of what happened.

I also pre-ordered the PS4/kh3 combo and I think they had to reimburse some people cause they didn't have enough to go around. I had an email saying I might get my money back. Got lucky and did receive my stuff. Different stories though."
gaming,ffxl0go,t3_evpd02,1580327278.0,"I pre-ordered kh2, but on release day the GameStop was shut down for remodeling. I went to a different GameStop and they wouldn't honor the preorder receipt I had so that really sucked. I still got a copy but ended up paying again for it. When that other GameStop finally reopened I was able to go back and get my preorder money back. It was a hassle for 13yo me."

Glad she's not online anymore."

pics,ffr83i7,t3_eun901,1580152504.0,"In the 90s when I was very young my mom worked at a VFW (for the unfamiliar it's a hangout/bar for veterans of foreign wars.) Sometimes they had events for the community and we would all go. I used to get scared because of all the older men with missing limbs or crazy scars. It wasn't until I was older that my mom told me when those men would get drunk sometimes they would share their war stories with each other and she would hear some really horrifying things, mostly ww2 or Korea. 

In elementary I was in the choir and we did a performance on MLK day about freedom, I remember my mom crying in the audience. When I asked her why she said all those men at VFW are who you are singing about. I didn't understand then. But it's great to know now, I wish I'd been older and could have spoken to those men myself."

Thank you :)"
funny,ffomy4u,t1_ffmaiul,1580079349.0,"Is this a thing? I will thank my mother next time I see her for allowing me to be spoiled with cereal variety.

We even had a ranking system. She would call from the store and ask what I wanted, if I couldn't decide she would choose the ""default"" option. She would keep track of how often I ate a specific kind and rank them herself. It was always a nice surprise for me. 

I hope all cereal lovers are getting what they want now as adults. :)"

videos,ffhp9vf,t3_etedre,1579946631.0,"In high school I worked on an orchestral 3 movement piece and one of the band directors randomly found it one day. I guess it had slipped out of my folder, not sure. But he offered to have the band play it, I have never felt such happiness as in that moment. Just humbled by hearing others play something I made. And honestly it wasn't even that great of music, but what an experience. Wish I still had it. I kept everything on Megaupload cause my hdd was only 60gb. Lost it all when the site went down."
gifs,ffhp544,t1_ffhchs2,1579946425.0,I remember really disliking her first English album and couldn't understand why all the girls in school were obsessed with it. I was probably in 3rd or 4th grade when it came out.
aww,fffn6z9,t3_et8myx,1579887574.0,My cat is about to be 6 and he only just started to become cuddly. Honestly I don't know how to handle it.  Sometimes he wants to stretch on me and get scratches but other times he wants to be on me without being touched and if I pet him at the wrong time he bites the shit out of me. It's an interesting time...
