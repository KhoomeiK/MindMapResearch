Long ago, Benjamin Franklin organized a ""Fire Insurance"" company. Subscribers had a plaque affixed to their building, showing that they were insured. If their building caught fire, the company would send a fire brigade to put out the fire. If a neighboring building was on fire, the brigade would make sure that the insured buildings were not damaged, but would let the uninsured buildings burn.

Cities learned that this was not an appropriate way to handle fires, and so we now have fire protection as a 'public good'. Tax money pays for municipal fire departments, which are always on the ready to put out fires for rich and poor.

We are now finally seeing that healthcare is also not a good sector for the ""insurance"" model. In part, it's for reasons that are the same as for fire control: As a people, we do not have the stomach to let people die of treatable diseases \*\*before our eyes\*\* (we are fine if they die in remote slums), just as a city cannot allow a whole block of uninsured buildings burn to the ground. One way or another, the cost of such a disaster becomes 'socialized'. In the case of fire protection, the unchecked destruction of buildings and common infrastructure, loss of life, and social disruption spreads through the community. In the case of healthcare, there are expanding circles of injury when preventable or treatable conditions are left unaddressed. This does not just apply to contagion, but also to the social disruption of medical bankruptcy and the demoralizing spectacle of children attempting to sell lemonade or mow lawns to help keep their relative alive.

The example of other developed countries shows that healthcare is better addressed as a ""public good"", which is paid for by all and enjoyed by all. Its benefits are widespread, *whether you get sick or not*. Just as we pay for municipal fire protection *whether our homes burn or not*."

Protect your hearing. You can do damage to your ears, and not know it until they fail catastrophically. Even a moderately loud work environment will contribute to later deafness. Wear ear plugs.

Then you will be a young adult living the prudent life of middle age. Bleah.

So, one in a while, take stupid chances and break the rules. Earn your scars, knowing that you decided to do it to yourself, and don't blame others. You may cherish those scars, and the tales that go with them, as much as you cherish your fat 401k"

Oh! Also, never lend money, unless you're fully prepared to be happy never to be paid back. If you think you can ensure repayment, you're getting into the banking business, and you don't want to do that."

There will be shelves of 'home repair' books. Even if you don't own a home, you'll need to make the toilet work when it suddenly quits. Sometimes the repair is just hooking the chain back onto the lever. That just saved you $100 for a plumber.

There will be shelves of cookbooks. They will be sorted by cuisine or by special technique (e.g. 'The Cast Iron Cook Book'). Learn to cook. You can save hundreds of dollars per month by cooking for yourself. You might find an entire TV cooking series on DVD there, too.

There will be a whole section of fiction. Many were best sellers years ago. That means they are great to read today.

There will be a room full of music and videos. You can borrow them, because everyone chipped in to pay for them. Also audiobooks."
Documentaries,fe6kyon,t3_enpmhb,1578894358.0,"There's an interesting story at [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/556/transcript) about Shin Sang-Ok. He and his wife (ex-wife? Can't remember) had been kidnapped by  Kim. Working for a dictator was . . . different.

>Shin always spoke of North Korea as the place he associated film freedom with and creative freedom with, because he could ask for anything and get it. In one episode, he asked for a model train to blow up for a scene, and he was given a real train packed with explosives on rails to blow up if he wanted to.

>And if he asked for a wind machine, he was sent helicopters. And if he wanted fake snow, everybody was flown to a mountain. There was no expense spared.

>Kim Jong-il felt like the larger than life film producer that you hear about. And he didn't have the downside that a film producer usually has, because a film producer usually has to say no every now and then. We don't have enough money. We don't have enough time."

The classic European one is a separate bathroom fixture that uses a pretty gentle steam of water. The one must commonly referred to in recommendations is a Japanese-style ""washlet"", which is a toilet seat replacement that includes a retractable water jet. The jet is pretty strong, and quite capable of giving you an episiotomy.

Ok, not that strong, but some can give you an enema if you're not careful."
