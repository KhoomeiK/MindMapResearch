Grans would tell us; “ you have a gift, to waste it is just stupid”. I had the ability, skills and knowledge to help make that possible for her. So that’s what I did..."

todayilearned,ffqau4z,t1_ffq1tkc,1580128597.0,"Honestly, I don’t know if I would go so far as to say “loving” there is, and has been a lot of anger and hurt thrown around. Bad things said and bonds damaged. We’ve scattered by choice, or the need to protect ourselves. But Grans was always the one beacon which drew us back together. My uncle who was her 1st child, and took the brunt of the family rage. Left one day and vanished... no contact, nothing. When Grans was put into the home, he started calling in, checking on her.. but always at odd hours and very quick conversations.

In her last days He re-appeared, we went to visit one day and there he was sitting with her. He ran away from the family and moved to Japan. Hid for years, new family, new kids... new life. 

He was with me and my oldest cousin when she passed... we were the only other 3 in the room. (She had asked for us by name.) everyone else was in the hall or on the way.

I have a void in my life of my uncle... 15 years of nothing. But after Grans passed, and we sat for a few minutes, he turned to me and hugged me. I’m 37, I’ve had family die... friends die... a best friend die in my arms... I’ve seen sadness, hurt, hopelessness. But I’ve never felt anything like the weight and anguish of that hug. He whispered to us “our lighthouse has gone out, what now?” 

Sadly her passing did little to stop the anger, now that belongings were “up for grabs”, and estates had to be dealt with, the fighting got worse. And my uncle left again. Now our fractured family has little hope of mending. I know that, my uncle knows that... it hurts, but we have no lamp to guide us all through the dark."

It got kind of ugly and she almost was “evicted” but we did not back down, it seemed crazy to us that they wouldn’t just let us do it... she’s an old lady suffering from dementia who has family who has the means and ability to make this whole experience REALLY easy on everybody. Just let us make a few changes to her unit... we’ll do the work ourselves. 

Finally they got a new Assistant director who said “ok, as long as it doesn’t end up costing the facility anything...” we started work the next day."
todayilearned,ffpoozu,t1_ffpmum4,1580100535.0,"Grans was the glue that held us all together even though the family’s had spread across the globe. She had a powerful presence about her, even in her last days. She took no shit and gave none, She never sugar coated anything, and we loved her for that. When she passed, we knew it was coming, and we were all at peace with it. I can still remember her last words, and the sound of her voice as she said them

“I’ve done a lot here... had some great kids, had some dumbass kids that turned out great... I think I’ve done everything I’m supposed to” she then closed her eyes and took a deep breath... said “Tate (my grandads name), I’m coming home.” Then silence. We cried, wept, screamed, raged... then all was quiet."
todayilearned,ffplw9h,t1_ffpkmpg,1580098292.0,"There is / was a nursing home community in Waco TX. that does stuff like this, although it has to be approved and you have to go through a long approval process. My grans was 79 when she was moved in to her unit. She had dementia and would freak out anytime she was in an “unfamiliar” environment. My uncles and I fought for about 9 months to get them to allow us to make her unit more familiar. In the end we painted the interior of her apartment the same color as her old home. Put up the same crown mounding she had... got some counter tops for her kitchenette that we’re as similar as we could get, and changed the carpet out to a color that was the same.

Then when one of us would visit, we would spray some of my granddads cologne in versions places so it always smelled like him."

mildlyinteresting,ff82c1t,t1_ff7r2xl,1579664144.0,"First response would be to take it to your IT department and explain the need to see the contents of the drive (assuming this is a corporate setting). Allow the IT department to access the drive in a sandboxed environment. That way if it does have something on it, there is no connection to the network, and the system is expendable. 

For a more “home” type environment, my first suggestion is DON’T. There isn’t any data in the world worth that headache. 

But again assuming you just HAVE to access the drive, remove any and ALL network connections. Isolate the machine as much as possible. Be certain you have Virus protection / malware protection / ransomware protection... basically anything you can get as a line of defense. Also go into it with the idea that “this could cause irreparable harm to my computer.”

But again, to be safe... DON’T."

Let me tell you, after the 3rd time you’ve locked out the CEO’s computer and he has to come to your office to get it unlocked, shit starts happening, lol. 

His 3rd visit he asked if we had a report of people who had been locked out. After flipping through the 3rd page, he said: “prepare a class and make it mandatory. If anyone does NOT show up, let me know.”"
