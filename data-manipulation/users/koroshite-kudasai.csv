depression,fejvmxy,t1_fej5dnx,1579186892.0,"Well, the one thing I’ll advise is to keep looking around for friends, even online. Having someone, even online, is better than no one. Once you’re out of hs it becomes so unimportant."
depression,fej580l,t1_fej54we,1579157385.0,You did? What did your parents say when you talked to them? How did your exploration for new friends go and did you current friends ignore your attempts to connect and hang out together?
SuicideWatch,fej53cp,t1_fej3j2w,1579157239.0,"It is, but based on what you’re describing I think that’s the closest thing to what you’re talking about."
depression,fej527c,t1_fej3nwz,1579157203.0,With your parents I think you should try talking to them about it and have a sit down conversation. As for your friends try inviting them to go do something and finding a time that works for all of you. If you think they don’t like you and are avoiding you try looking for new friends and put them on a sort of back burner. What I can tell you though for sure is that high school is such a small group of people in your whole life. I can tell you for a fact that once you get to college nothing in high school matters anymore and it’ll have almost no effect on the rest of your life.
depression,fej3kgn,t1_fej39p5,1579155583.0,I see. Are you in college or high school? How do you know that your parents and friends don’t care about you? I don’t think that you deserve to die just for that.
SuicideWatch,fej3fai,t3_epfc4r,1579155429.0,"I think what you’re looking for is called emancipation. Basically what this entails is that you would assume most responsibilities for yourself before turning 18 (when this would normally happen). This also means that your parents would no longer be your legal guardians. This is a legal process and you’d need a lawyer for it. Obviously I can’t give you any actual legal advice, and can only tell you of the existence of this option."
depression,fej31mw,t1_fej2y39,1579155028.0,"I would highly suggest against any kind of firearm. Of course, I don’t think you should do this at all, but definitely stay away from firearms. Personally, I like to know why you want to do this?"
depression,fej2xl0,t1_fej2t7a,1579154911.0,"If you don’t mind me asking, where do you go to school?"
depression,fej2umg,t1_fej2lfg,1579154829.0,"That’s not the one with lowest pain. That just has the highest lethality rate at 99%. Also, it’s not instantaneous. And should it somehow land in that 1% area, it’d be extremely painful and you’d become permanently paralyzed and unable to ever try anything like that again."
depression,fej2h7s,t3_epf6kt,1579154445.0,"I live in an apartment by myself, barely leave, have almost no friends, and barely ever talk to people. I also have shit grades and am struggling in my major (which isn’t even what I want to do, but am unable to switch into what I want to)."
depression,fej2e79,t1_fej280k,1579154362.0,I see. Based on the pain scale you’ve made what do you plan on doing? I’m asking because the things with the lowest actual pain measurement take multiple hours to actually work.
depression,fej2av5,t3_epf6la,1579154269.0,"Have you tried looking from the perspective of, you’re 26 and already had sex when you were 20? They’re plenty of people in their 20s on here that would love to have had that happen."
depression,fej25b7,t3_epf68u,1579154120.0,Why are you so sure about doing this and that method?
depression,fej00el,t3_epepmu,1579152108.0,"Sounds like she needs some asian parenting. Unfortunately, she’s over 18 you can’t personally instill lessons in her anymore. What I would do is tell her to straighten up her act and that when she’s ready to do that you’ll try and offer some help, but until then she’s on her own. I know it’ll be hard to let her go like that, but nothing you can do will change her. If she’s this adamant about being rebellious, you need to let her learn on her own why she shouldn’t do what she’s doing and why she doesn’t really want to go to jail. Her disrespecting you and your mother with her words and actions can’t be tolerated so cutting her off will cause her to lose that power she has. Then with the lessons she’ll learn, she’ll come to understand how her actions have consequences and how she’s only affecting her own life."
SuicideWatch,feg12id,t1_feg0q5a,1579072390.0,"I know you want to prepare for the worst by letting him go, but what if he doesn’t want to. Talk to him. If he decides to go then there was nothing to be done anyway, but if he decides to stay then you’d have made a mistake if you hadn’t talked to him."
depression,feg0uhf,t3_eoyyxf,1579072130.0,"My advice would be to start looking for new friends. Leave them on a back burner as people to talk to if you don’t have someone else to talk to while you’re looking. Just know that if they’re talking shit about you behind your back, then they’re probably doing about others too and no one likes two-faced people like that. It looks and sounds bad. Anytime someone tries to talk shit about someone else around me I tell them that I think the other person is an alright person and leave. My rule is, if they’re talking shit about someone else, then they’re probably doing about you too."
SuicideWatch,feg0lp9,t1_feg030s,1579071848.0,"I know what it can be like, other people saying things to you that are dumb and offensive. When people say stuff to me it comes from ignorance. For that you can either brush it off, or respond similarly. As for your partner, if you really have to know if he’s ok with it, and you’re ok with potentially having to let him go, I think you should sit down and talk with him about it. Tell him how you feel and that you don’t if you’ll ever feel better, but that you want and are trying to. Ask him if he knows that if you two stay together it might not go away and it’ll be something you’ll have to deal with together. I believe he’ll be ok with it and will want to help."
depression,feg01mr,t1_fefzcrq,1579071213.0,Of course. I hope it helps you as much as it helps/helped me.
SuicideWatch,fefze9d,t1_fefz3xe,1579070483.0,"Well if he’s said that he wants to help then I think he realizes that it might take a while and has thought about and accepted that. You both seem like very intelligent people. Even if he didn’t say it out loud, I think he knows."
depression,fefz67d,t3_eoygbj,1579070242.0,"I have those same thoughts sometimes as well. I find this quote helps me remember why I should keep moving forward, “There can't possibly be any meaning in this world. But isn't that wonderful in its own right? Because if there isn't any, we can find our own.”"
SuicideWatch,fefz0n4,t3_eoyhls,1579070077.0,"Maybe you’ve already considered this, but maybe he wants to be in it with you so he can help you through everything. I think that when you find someone you really care about that you want to help them even if it hurts you in the process. Perhaps, and I could be wrong about this, he’s ok with helping you, but you feel a sense of guilt that you may be holding him back? You could try asking for his opinion on the matter and see how he feels about everything."
depression,fcp3rev,t1_fcmrda1,1577849561.0,"From one Korean to another I wish you the best of luck. On the upside, korea is the home of all the best skin care products. That’s where I get all of mine from. XD"
SuicideWatch,fco9aey,t1_fcmr6i3,1577826671.0,He said he was mainly taking bio and chem classes and that he’d be taking ochem next semester. He’ll also be taking in organic chem later on as well. So not a lot of math :)
SuicideWatch,fcmr52v,t1_fcmr2bu,1577788124.0,Glad I could help. If you want I could ask my friend what courses he’s taking for his premed stuff so you could get a better idea of what you’ll need for college?
SuicideWatch,fcmqxzo,t1_fcmqpwe,1577787837.0,"Ok, well, they’re either lying or don’t know what they’re talking about. I can personally tell you that you won’t need anything beyond high school math, so calc 1 maybe calc 2 at the most. There wouldn’t be any reason for you to need to learn more. You’re going to be a surgeon not an engineer. I went to hs with a lot of rich people whose parents were almost all doctors, and one of my friends is doing pre-med rn. They dont/didn’t need a whole lot of math. I do, but that’s because I’m an engineer."
SuicideWatch,fcmqrel,t3_ei137q,1577787574.0,I think people say that because they don’t consider the reasons most people give when they’re under 18 as legitimate reasons to be depressed. That however is wrong because someone can be depressed for any reason. Just because your under 18 doesn’t mean that you don’t feel the same way someone over 18 feels when they’re depressed.
SuicideWatch,fcmqlb8,t1_fcmpt58,1577787336.0,A surgeon? Who told you that you needed math for that? You need biology and other stuff like that in the science area.
depression,fcmqjqm,t3_ei0bz1,1577787274.0,"Everyone has their own flaws whether that’s not being smart, attractive, athletic, or low eq, etc. I don’t think that just because someone is unattractive that that’s some horrible thing. I think one of the only upsides to being depressed is that you start to realize the value and importance of your personality. Looks change with time and plus there are so many ways to change that anyway. What is much harder to change with time is your personality and that’s what’s important and you seem like a nice person. I’m sure you look good. Besides that, being Korean is awesome."
SuicideWatch,fcmpo3q,t3_ei0t9y,1577786029.0,"Math is unfortunately one of those subjects that’s really hard until it clicks. Geometry is kind of a weird category in math. All the other stuff builds on top of each other so algebra is needed for algebra 2, then precalc/calc, and then calc 2, etc. whereas geometry is just off on its own. It’ll be kind of relevant for multi variable calculus, but overall I haven’t used it much at all. The good news is that high school doesn’t matter. Once you finish that’s it and you never have to deal with it again. If you go to college, great, and unless your major requires math then that’s the end of math for you. The one other important thing is that in math classes you’re given tests and not allowed to look things up, but in life no one is giving you tests and no one says that. Your boss is never going to ask you random questions and say you can’t google it. You’ll be given projects and they don’t care what you google while you do it as long as you get the job done. Sorry if I went of topic there. Point is, don’t worry about high school so much. It’s only 4 years of your entire life. If you really need help with your math try checking out khanacademy. They’ve got great stuff that helped me a lot with my math."
SuicideWatch,f6yv7v1,t1_f6yuy6n,1573299420.0,Try and pinpoint specific things. Why would it be better? Would it be better for you or others and how? If you can find specific things it’ll be easier to help fix them.
