Assyrians/Chaldeans are a lot alike with the Italian immigrants. My mother in law came here when she was in her early teens and her family is very Italian. They are loud, they are a big family, they're fun. When my in laws were at my parents house for our little backyard wedding (I strayed and hate show), they thought it was huge and just as loud and just as crazy as their gatherings. I didn't marry far off from my own culture. We both are crazy about hospitality in that we want people to feel like they are always welcome in our homes, feed them until they explode and lots and lots of passion when we talk to each other (not fighting, just a lot of laughter about serious talk).
