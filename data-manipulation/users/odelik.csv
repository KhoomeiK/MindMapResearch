Medicare expansion will open up tons of work in the operations of Medicare services & reps. If hospitals & doctors are now seeing patients more consistently due to massively expanded coverage and affordability (I have great insurance but avoid going to do things in fear of out of pocket coasts blowing away my FSA if really needed for instance), more staff will be needed to handle the additional workload.

This won't take care of everyone, but that's where job training & transition services come in."
politics,fekif0s,t1_fekh258,1579200696.0,"Oh, seriously. I've done development work with the FB platform, as well as working with their advertising platform. The FB graph API is insanely powerful. 

Every developer & advertiser I've interacted with that's had 30 minutes of experience with the platforms have easily come up with ways it could be abused.

If even a small percentage of people fed up with this shit decided to abuse the hell out of the tooling we're to do so in protest, FB may have to do something about it. Or lose their jobs for getting their business API keys & advertising accounts blocked with a ToS violation.

Edit:

In all honesty, I'd rather see enforced regulations than ""the guiding forces of the free market"" here. The market is too easily manipulated as has been proven time & time again.

The Seattle area isn't as mall dense as a lot of areas where mall death is happening.

Look at Phoenix and you can find dead malls and shopping centers all over, but you'll also notice that there's still plenty alive and thriving.

But mostly we watch the shows for inspiration and new techniques (aside from raw entertainment).

However, my girlfriend has gone to culinary school and I grew up cooking alongside my Hungarian mother as well as having worked in a kitchen for my first few jobs. So we are not your everyday home cooks.

Cooking is really not that difficult. There's a learning curve for sure, and a few basics to understand: preparing all your ingredients beforehand (mies en plas), cleaning as you go, be patient and use a low heat vs high heat or else you'll sear the outside and have a raw inside (ever had a burned fried egg with raw whites inside?), cook with fats, taste your food as you go, and always use a sharp knife. Starting with these basics you'll slowly build up knowledge and experience that cater to your personal tastes before expanding out."

BuyItForLife,fc1houa,t1_fc1gd4l,1577319092.0,"You're right that you don't have to spend the most money. But you definitely have to do research to find products that are worth while at all price points.

Generally the most inexpensive are designed to be a throwaway product, but going up at least one price tier introduces you to a product that is reliable for some time if not a lifetime. Then as you go up in price tiers you get increased quality and features. This is not universal and sometimes a product does everything it needs to do at a a low price tier and is extremely utilitarian (look ot Victorinox knives and other products they make for example)."
BuyItForLife,fc1g7pw,t1_fc1f55h,1577317818.0,"Quality that a company stands behind.

When buying a product with a substantial warranty, you know that that company stands behind their quality and either plans for that item to last at least a lifetime or produces a product that is serviceable.

That's the entire point of this sub. Or, at least, used to be before it turned into a sub for ""here's a picture of a relic that's been barely used you can't buy any more that I just acquired!"". 

Many utilitarian people want to invest in products they have to buy once, use for a lifetime, and never have to buy again. 

Think of it this way. You can buy a pepper mill that lasts a year or or so throughout your life and spend upwards to $600 (2019 dollars) or you could spend a little more up front and spend $60-$100 once. 

Also, it's better for the environment."
