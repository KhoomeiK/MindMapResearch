AskReddit,ffgrh99,t3_etcyd6,1579913189.0,Nothing. Depression is an ugly battle that you really have to do by yourself. People being there for you doesn’t make a difference. It’s all the same

teenagers,fe6k909,t1_fe6jsiz,1578893645.0,"If you’ve really had it, and it really got severe, you’d understand that you just can’t stop it. You sound exactly like the posts on r/wowthanksimcured. It can take years to get through it and sometimes that not even long enough. Go look on r/depression and tell me again that you can just ‘get over it’. Fuck off"
teenagers,fe6j7zf,t1_fe6h805,1578892647.0,This ‘bitchy edgelord bs’ is me being fucking depressed for over a year. You’d have to have depression to understand what people with depression really go through. You can’t just decide to be happy all of a sudden. There’s only suffering
teenagers,fe6g455,t3_ens4yo,1578889859.0,"It doesn’t matter. I can’t keep going with this weight buried inside of me, festering me, making me suffer day in and day out. The thought of death makes me happy and I long for it. No one really cares about me. Not you. Not anyone on this thread. All I have is myself"

depression,fddck5d,t1_fdd9wvi,1578305711.0,Why the downvote (unless it wasn’t you then nvm) all I did was ask why you continue living. I’m still curious tbh. The only reason I’m still here is because I have to be. What makes you get up in the morning and not decide today is the day you don’t hang yourself?
depression,fdd9yr1,t1_fdd9wvi,1578301782.0,If your 27 then why don’t you just die. You have the choice. I really don’t. What’s your motivation
2meirl4meirl,fd62uv9,t3_ejwyue,1578184783.0,Still growing up being that friend. Probably part of the reason why I want to commit suicide lol
2meirl4meirl,fd5lylm,t3_ejwyue,1578178896.0,I am that friend rn. I don’t even have the self confidence to even ask to participate in fun stuff I constantly hear that they’re doing. I literally just stopped hanging around that group at school now

wholesomememes,fcymy5g,t3_ejdjqb,1578083039.0,This doesn’t do a fucking thing for depressed people.
me_irl,fcdtu6r,t1_fcdqdiw,1577613761.0,Well I downvoted to spite your upvote
depression,fcdtsfm,t1_fcdrzin,1577613741.0,"I hope I do too. Just going through some weird, rough shit(other than the depression lol) irl. Seems like that’s always happening with me lol"
depression,fcdrng5,t1_fcdpxit,1577612928.0,Oh I’m 15 rn. This definitely does not give me hope for the future lol
me_irl,fcdq9q3,t1_fcdq55o,1577612511.0,Then upvote

(Also can only comment every 8 minutes, because reddit is being gay)"
depression,fcdirh8,t1_fcdfuy8,1577610396.0,cutting also gives me an even better feeling of relief. It makes you feel in control. It also makes you feel *something* instead of the constant void. I just want to die die die

depression,fcdfgqn,t3_eh3gbo,1577609500.0,"I, too, constantly dream of suicide. I have a vivid sorta day-dream like fantasy of it constantly. Sometimes I’m leaping from a bridge I pass by everyday. or put a gun to my head and pull the trigger, with everything else just black around me. death is the only thing I’m working towards."
depression,fcdd26m,t3_eh3q86,1577608903.0,God won’t help you. Expecting his help is naive. No one will help you but yourself. Don’t expect an all-mighty god to come to your aid and cure your depression.
gaybros,fcd286b,t1_fcbkdyl,1577605449.0,"The child that has innocence. The child that wasn’t subjected through years of trauma. The child that doesn’t have to wake up every day, just to suffer, wishing for death at every moment. The pure weight of depression weighing on him, making him cut himself, slash his wrists, choke himself, hoping for death. We’re talking about that child."
u_Rob_A1972,fc6vcfa,t3_du9pww,1577490449.0,You don’t know how to reddit very well
