gamernews,fgpt6ea,t1_fgprho5,1581011516.0,"They pretty much are just a game based hot topic. Personally, I don’t know anyone who understands how abused market works have many complaints about them. 90% of the complaints are that GameStop doesn’t pay them what their used games are worth. Anyone with an iota of knowledge of economics would say “of COURSE they didn’t!” They need to sell the games for close to what it’s worth so they need to pay you less than so they can make a profit that pays for the overhead plus liability of old inventory they can’t move. When all that is factored in then it makes perfect sense that game that cost $30 three years ago and you don’t play anymore because a new one has come out or the fan base has cooled or whatever is now worth $1. GameStop is paying you wholesale prices for your game, not retail. 

Let’s put it this way: we willingly give our old clothes to thrift stores. If those stores instead paid us $0.25 for a shirt, we’d be hearing so many people complain about what a rip off that was. That the shirt is worth more than just $0.25. You could easily sell it on Craig’s list for ten times that amount! A paltry sum changes the equation emotionally but not financially. 

Frankly, I think the solution to the ill-will and financial issues they were having with the used game market is NOT to pay more, but to remove themselves from the equation. Create a marketplace for customers to sell their used games and consoles to each other and take a 20% cut or something like that. Sell it to someone online, print out the form, take the game to a GameStop where they sign off on it and ship it direct to the new owner. No one feels ripped off, GameStop gets their cut while reducing dependence on their B&M locations. The used game market is still alive and well. Everyone is happy. 

Or we can accept that GameStop’s place in this industry is weak as publishers are pushing to reach their audience direct and they should fold up before they bleed more. 

And the rest of the complaints are identical to any store who pays minimum wage to young workers who suck at customer service. GameStop just happens to have a younger leaning audience so the online rants are a bit higher."

gamernews,fgph8hh,t1_fgpgdbo,1581004747.0,"Where did I say that GameStop should have charged more for games? That’s a completely different discussion than whether they should have paid customers more for used merch. 

If GameStop struggled to have an adequately stocked used market, then clearly they were not paying customers enough for games. If a lack of a stocked used market is a leading cause of their financial struggle, then it would be a reasonable suggestion that maybe if they paid more for trade ins they would have been more successful. Since their used market was going just fine, then paying customers more for games (when they didn’t need the increased supply) would have resulted in a net loss of revenue over their current model.

I’ve never heard of people thinking their credit score is penalized by paying off loans early because that’s ridiculous. However, credit scores can be HUGE. Once you have money, it becomes easier and easier to make more money and low interest rates are part of that. I have a perfect credit score and you’d be amazed some of the doors that opens. My mortgage rate is about 3.3% and I got it when the average rate was 4%. That saves me approximately $50k over the life of the loan. I bought a new car and put it on a loan. With my credit, the loan cost me $300 for the life of it. I put the cash I could have given them for the car instead into a mutual fund and let it earn me a couple thousand instead. Remember how you said “money now is worth more than money later”? That’s what that means! Borrowing means you have the money now instead of later if the rates are good.

If you’re talking billboard printing, then I see the issue as digital is 100% taking over that area. It’s time to pivot into similar markets where your equipment and skill set are all still relevant but with a different customer base.  Assuming you’re printing on flexible vinyl, getting yourself a vinyl hemming machine and grommeter will open you up to plenty of alternative signage options. Stuff like temporary advertising tied to fences during local sports games. Banners that tie onto buildings to advertise sales or grand openings. Signage at local colleges. And much more.

For a whiskey to be called “scotch” (I.e. “Scottish whiskey”) it just be made in Scotland. Japanese whiskey may be better than scotch.

Anytime you say “scotch” you are saying a shorthand form of “Scottish whiskey”. So there’s no problem in saying the Japanese do not make Scotch anymore than saying the Japanese do not make Kentucky bourbon. They make fantastic Scottish-style whiskey for sure. But they do not make scotch by definition any more than they make Irish whisky. The same goes for champagne as it is shorthand for “sparkling wine from Champagne”.

I’m an advocate of supporting local officers with your business but be careful doing so. It’ll be important to understand the local PD’s policy on how they define “gifts”. Well run and accountable districts will prohibit their officers from accepting gifts from the community so you’ll need to make sure your discounts do not violate those policies. The shop my spouse worked at once had someone calling around asking if a particular officer had ever accepted a free coffee while on duty.

smallbusiness,fgfmqbj,t3_ey3m26,1580742806.0,"Source: I’ve been in the USA print industry since 2003. Of the entire industry, the only part that isn’t experiencing significant flux or declining revenue is signage. Unless you mean you haven’t augmented your offerings to include more modern signage types or you mean you haven’t converted to digital printers and you’re running screen of offsets instead. The biggest competitors to signage in my area is wholesale printers and brokers who can deliver slightly worse products for significantly less money. 

I can’t speak to why you’re experiencing declining sales but I can say a few things. 

1) stop worrying how things appear to those who aren’t your customers. If extended family thinks you’ve got it made then you’re either not properly communicating with them the reality of your business or you’re afraid for them to know the truth and hide it. Either way, that doesn’t actually affect anything so don’t worry about it. 

2) the best part of being a business owner is you get to decide what kind of business you want to run. If you don’t want to focus on digital design, you don’t have to. The worst part of being a business owner is that your decisions will impact the success of your company. However, **there’s no shame in choosing to close shop rather than run a business you don’t want to run**! If digital is the only way forward and you don’t want to go digital, don’t. 

3) the one thing local, short run print has been lacking is properly sales ability. Most shops are operator-owned and print operators frequently do not make good salespeople. A sales person/account manager who is responsive, knowledgeable, trustworthy, and speaks the layperson’s language will win clients from the other shops easily. If you don’t have that, you’ll perish in today’s market.

4) if it helps. I have a friend who owns a sign shop in town as well. She was experiencing declining sales as well as a different sign shop was taking her clients. She made a last ditch effort by paying a marketing/lead generating company a few thousand dollars a month. As far as I know, they are booming again. Every time I’ve walked in they have had three times the number of products waiting for pickup than last year. Could help; could be the death of the business. It really depends on why the decline in revenue.

He’s also potentially in trouble if he doesn’t therefore treat you as a 1099 worker. That means you get to pick your shifts and he doesn’t really control the method that you work.

If someone teases you regardless of where you see them, then walk away. If a bar knows that anytime any female walks in they will be teased by patrons and *do not do anything to stop i*t, then the bar is opening themselves up to a discriminatory lawsuit under title VII."
smallbusiness,ffsqtga,t1_ffsoa6e,1580189222.0,"You’re flat wrong about harassment being harassment. Sexual harassment at work has additional legal precedent over it as it is frequently considered employer  discrimination as well if the environment is hostile towards someone on the basis of their gender. The EEOC has their own definitions of workplace sexual harassment that doesn’t necessarily have to follow state laws on standard person to person harassment. Teasing someone about their gender at a bar is not considered sexual harassment. If the teasing occurs to someone at work regularly or (to follow the original question) for seven months and the employer does not intervene then the employer would be opening themselves up to actionable liability suits for hostile work environment under title VII.

The courts have determined that an affirmative defense against liability claims of workplace harassment should include promptly enacting reasonable care and policies to prevent and correct any behavior that might be construed as harassing. There’s no hard and fast line of what is acceptable and what is unacceptable and OP has seen “evidence” of said harassment. So assuming OP is a reasonable person, we have a clear cut case is someone needing to immediately discuss this with a lawyer to understand what to do to minimize liability. 

The anger is because you’re doubling down on false statements that conflate workplace sexual harassment with person to person harassment when they work differently. OP is not the harasser. OP’s actions from this moment forward will determine the company’s legal defense should the company be held liable for a hostile environment. To suggest that teasing is legal in the workplace is flat wrong. Simple teasing in the workplace (especially from a superior) is NOT legal if the employee is distressed by it and a reasonable person would not consider it harmless. Sexual haras"
