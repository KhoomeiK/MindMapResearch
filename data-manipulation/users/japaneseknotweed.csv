You can't become a ""real"" Suzuki teacher without the training, which mainly deals with the how/why/when of all the specific teaching points. Book one is especially dense, because that's when all the fundamentals are laid down. 

But you *can* draw on your own experience, kindness, observation, creativity, and use the Suzuki sequence as a framework, since you know the rep.

Reddit it is an interesting place sometimes. Your first post really did make me think you were a, hmm,  typical redditor. I've seen ""professor"" flairs on folks who turned out to be occasional tutors at mall Guitar Centers. 

I don't regret anything I wrote, it's a decent quick-and-dirty explanation that younger folks can start with (and then go buy the Benade book and do it right), and hell, you're the one taking cheap shots at my instrument family. :)

Perhaps we can chalk the previous up to a lifetime of fending off ""hurr duur dumb guitarists/neurotic string players"" and leave it at that? 

OK. So you bring up a couple of points  I've also spent time musing over. 

(warning: wall o'text ahead, poorly edited, it's late. tl;dr: violins and guitars might be different)
 


Story:

For some reason, I don't know why, my personal ""A"" is stuck at 442. Maybe our family turntable was a little wonky? Maybe my dad had a lot of German recordings (played on his homemade wifi/stack of ARs,/pair of Electrostatics). Maybe it was where my Czech violin ""wanted"" to be. 

In undergrad, I said as much to a piano-apprentice friend who laughed, reached over and tweaked my pegs loose, then challenged me to find the ""A"" out of my head. I tuned back up, he whipped a fork out of his pocket, I was dead on. Huh. We repeated the experiment over the next few days, I was always dead on. So my ""internal 442"" was a total myth; much ribbing ensued.  
A week later he let me see the fork. It was a '42 fork. Jerk. 

That set me up to wondering/listening over the next few decades.  

(regarding actual playing: I codeswitch between variety of styles and bump up against a lot of weird venues/vintage instruments, if I was the type to dissolve into vapors at non-standard tunings I'd be dead by now. Stick the damn thing under your chin and play, you know?) 

Some ensembles seem unaffected. Some change. Is the personalities? The instruments themselves?  

Two years ago I bought a new (to me, very nice old French) violin. It doesn't ""want"" to be at 442 near so hard. My old one had a very noticeable bloom at '42, was much more reticent at 440, to the point where it was clear to other players; this one doesn't change much -- maybe because it's simply a better instrument. My old Jetta cruised nicely at 68 and 74 mph and rattled inbetween, my current better car settles in smoothly  wherever. 

So does tweaking the A provide a cheap ""upgrade"" to lesser instruments, much more so than to the top level ones? 
Are lesser instruments more prone to having a sweet spot?
Are lesser *players* responding to a different set of ""rewards""?   

A year ago I started my using my new one for baroque music, with the aforementioned fragile old harpsichord. Tuning down to 415 turns this particular instrument into a completely new being. It's not about sound, it's about response. It's about where the instrument becomes more forgiving, more picky, more generous. It's really weird. ""Bright/dark"" aren't words I'd use at all, it's not about what's coming in my *ears*, it's about the partnership. 

Meanwhile, I do a lot of ""playing in""/trying out of violins, for luthier/maker friends who want feedback on setups, or for buyers/new adult students who don't play well enough yet to really put an instrument through its paces, but are old enough and opinionated enough (and financially stable enough) to buy a good one that suits them. Part of that playing has involved messing with the A, and the best I can tell you is: it depends. 

Sussing out what's *truly* going on with what we feel/hear is a deep, deep rabbit hole, and it sounds like you've gone down it more than I have, with the proper equipment. All I've done is thought and listened.   
 
Side-thought: if you've run a lot of sound, at some point you've probably twiddled an imaginary knob in response to yet-another-complaint-about-the-monitors -- and seen a musician smile and say ""Much better, thanks!"" -- and the weird thing is, they're not stupid, they're not delusional, it really *did* sound better to them as soon as you moved your fingers over a muted channel while inwardly cursing them out for not understanding that the venue is essentially a giant dumpster and there's only so much you can do. 


Yeah, probably some of what we're hearing is just voodoo.

But some of it isn't. 

Here's something I'd invite you to ponder as a guitarist: perhaps there's a significant difference between percussive and sustained instruments.  

I also play piano and couldn't care less where one is tuned, I'll play it. I'll also transpose anything you want, either myself, or with the magic button. Don't care. 

(side note: I *do* care about *types* of tuning. I wish to hell the Suzuki violin world wouldn't have their littlest beginners listen over and over to recordings of *tempered* piano backups. Violin isn't tempered. If you're working on Vivaldi and have a keyboard w/ a *just* tuning option? 9 out of 10 kids like it better. They know. ) 

Perhaps the experience of a strike-and-decay instrument doesn't respond to pitch-raising in the same way as a sustained, ""sung"" instrument? 

Like I said, for me a change in pitch changes how the instrument *handles*, the way it *steers*. That's a function of *ongoing* sound, which you can't get w/ guitar -- or piano. 

Anyway, thanks for an interesting exchange. 

Oh, and one final anecdote: last time we did the Saint Saens organ symphony? And somebody turned the heat down overnight and the organ was at 436? You should have *heard* the orchestra bitching -- but it was the brass and winds. So maybe they're behind the inflation as well, not us strings?

Hearing loss makes you lose the pop and crackle of consonants, everything starts to sound like the ""woa-woa-woa"" teacher on the Charlie Brown cartoons.

>this is it's all based on exposure - they used to tune to 441, then they get used to that and it doesn't sound as bright as 442, then they get used to that and it's not as bright as 443, etc.

is incorrect, and your analogy of working with a capo for a week isn't really germane.  

What *is* a good analogy is the way your personal guitar sounds plugged into a different *amp*. It's going to sound *very* different to you at first, because we as musicians are sensitive to timbre changes, but after a while, once you've acclimated, it'll *still* sound different -- because it is. 

A violin is its own amp, and when you change any aspect of the input, the output is going to be different too. 
Bridge pressure and string tension are part of the algorithm, same as the size/shape/material of a speaker cone or size of the magnet.  

And last I checked, guitar players seemed to like to spend a lot of time discussing the various attributes of different amps...and I pretty sure they don't see those differences as imaginary. 

Hell, I know guitar players that'll swear up and down that picking tweed vs brown leatherette on a pignose will change your sound, so don't start on us string players for being superstitious. :)"

>supposed 

>sensation that doesn't sustain

The extra brilliance of higher tuning is neither imaginary nor a fleeting comparison-based thing, it's a function of putting more tension on the strings and downwards pressure on the bridge, same way ones voice sounds different at higher pitches when one's vocal cords are stretched tighter. 

A violin is comprised of a collection of ""Chladni plates"" that -- very roughly -- function like a bunch of speaker cones of various sizes, each one ""waking up"" and resonating, driving the air, when the frequencies it's sympathetic to are sounded. The vibrations that drive each plate originate in the strings and travel through the bridge to the top plate; tuning higher pushes that contact point tighter, which ups the ""driving force"". 

My car sounds and feels specifically different at 32K rpm/75 mph than at 24rpm/55, it's not just me temporarily not being adjusted to the recent acceleration. It also corners differently, and reacts to potholes in a much more pronounced manner. My violin sounds, acts, and reacts differently at 442 than at 415, because it is literally being driven harder.    

tl;dr: physics."

>the string players believe  
>but the problem is it's all based on exposure  
>If they were only smart enough 

I'm a string player, I tune up to 442 with one particular ensemble, (the bagpipe is high),  down to 415 with another (the harpsichord is fragile), to 440 for all recording, and anywhere in between when working with variously-upkept pianos. 

I'm quite familiar with the personality of my instrument at each pitch, the same way I'm familiar with the different timbres of string brands and acoustical spaces and even changes in weather.  

The feeling of ""difference"", the first reaction to *exposure* to a change, is about as fleeting -- and as significant -- as that moment all the colors look weird when you first take off sunglasses.  

The Boston Symphony tunes to 441; I've never looked up why, but I bet it's more than just what the string players believe because they're not smart enough to pick something else.

A bunch'o suggestions for your whole gardening/farming operation:

If you want to experiment with multiple varieties of things, check out Pine Tree seeds out of Maine. Good prices on small packages and a lot of variety, plus everything's short-season/cold hardy just like MI/WI. 

I highly recommend trying two turnips: the Gilfeather from VT, and the Macomber from MA. 

For cherry tomatoes, Matt's Wild Cherry is ABsolutely impervious to late blight. Like, completely.  

If you're not already growing husk tomatoes, try them! Kids really love playing hunt-the-fruit when they start dropping, and they keep perfectly well just sitting around still in the husk. The Molly version is worth seeking out, the stems are much sturdier and the yields are stupendous, plus they reseed like crazy so you only have to buy once. They're faaabulous over venison, sauteed with shallots into a warm ""chutney""

And finally, my own favorite gardening tip: If you interplant fast kohlrabi between tall/slow versions of kale, the kohl's will reach maturity with no problem because the kale aren't too big yet -- and then the kale opens up and shades the kohls, which helps them stand in the field without toughening up for about three times longer than the seed packet says. Plus it just looks cool, those little ""spaceships"" hiding out underneath the kale ""trees"". 

I've got farming neighbors here in VT who are growing corn for meal and soybeans for tofu, I'll see what I can find out and get back to you.

>she wants a bond with someone who has things I don't  

Honestly/IMHO? I think this whole thing is not your problem/job. She wants a collection of mutually incompatible things. She needs to figure out which ones are undeniable, which can be compromised on. 

As a loving spouse, your job is to support her, thoughtfully, to the extant you are able without causing yourself undue pain, while she figures it out -- while simultaneously processing your own feelings and preparing for several different outcomes -- and hopefully not adding more drama, more emotional thrashing, to the mix. 

You've obviously got the self-awareness, discipline, and kindness to do this as well as any mortal could. 
  
It really sounds like a good counselor can help you both come up with a -- hmm -- feasible timeline/decision-making structure.  Finding someone smart who truly gets the academic thing (and maybe the LDS thing?) is probably worth a drive.

source: I'm in my 50s, female, understand the academia thing, have been with both men and women long-term. I'd never ever be able to live with an open relationship, but I *would* be ok with a temporary-liberty thing, for ""research"". How about you? 

I'm willing to guess she doesn't really know if you're not The One because you're not The One, or because you're Not a Woman. What does she need to do to figure it out? And can you be ok with what she needs?

Know the ingredients of every single major and minor triad cold. Be able to recognize them instantly in root position, or inverted, or doubled up in dense clusters, or spread out over sparse voicings. 

Understand the essential nature of tonic/dominant harmony. Be able to spot it in the wild.

>what can I read to learn to do that?

Don't read, do. Play. Play a lot. Notice what you're playing and ask yourself why it's doing what it's doing. 

The best tip I've got for an actual specific activity? Transpose. 
Take anything you like and learn how to play it in three other keys.
