Games,ffaalhf,t1_ff9yb4c,1579731133.0,Are we ignoring the obvious dark souls inspiration? The truth is that it took a lot of stuff from different games and wrapped it neatly in a Star Wars package. That isnt a bad thing. World of Warcraft did the exact same thing and it was great. A game doesn't have to be original to be good.

patientgamers,ff5vwu5,t1_ff5r6ib,1579612048.0,"Besides all the normal stuff that comes with other Battle Royales like proper positioning and map rotation skills, the biggest thing is the wide variety of useful building combinations that you can use. A lot of these are incredibly difficult to do from a mechanical perspective but reward the player in game. Add this to the fact that every single build piece can be edited multiple ways and the complexity adds up quickly. For an example here's one of the best players 1v1 free building against another pro player. These rarely play out like actual games but they are a good display of mechanical skill and what you see in a video like this is only a small portion of the different types of builds so it doesn't even really begin to cover everything but it'll at least give you an idea of whats possible https://youtu.be/98p63YWkHiI"
