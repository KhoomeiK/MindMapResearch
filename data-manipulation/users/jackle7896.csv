Of course there's people here on the internet whether they're on the right or left that are living in their own fantasy realm and won't listen, but the reality is most people are willing to have a civil discussion. Their minds may not be changed, but they'll still listen. These people you interact with presumably online are a vocal minority that make them feel like a majority. Using your logic, I can say a lot of left-leaning people are equally as toxic considering I've been called a racist Nazi simply by saying I have certain right-wing beliefs that are waaaaay far from Nazism or white nationalism(also considering I'm Hispanic so that doesn't make much sense anyway) I think the big problem here is large and/or false assumptions.

No, it's not. But from my experience, nothing became any healthier, it just all turned into bland, tasteless and equally as bad junk. The fruit was about the only thing worth eating. The vegetables were either just burnt for some reason, or wasn't edible. But hey people are gonna get mad anyway so oh well, You win some and you lose some. All in all, I just hope school food will end up actually tasting good to make kids want to eat it AND be healthy."
