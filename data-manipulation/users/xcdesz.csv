Any news story that comes out which is negative to their side -- it is always presented with a headline that brings up their favorite enemies -- Nancy Pelosi, AOC, and hollywood celebrities -- so they know for sure what side to take.

Yeah, he's just a businessman when you come down to it,  not a villain or a genius or a saint.  I don't mind him being rich... the thing that bothers me is the power that he used over the computer industry when we had no choice but to use his products...

For the record, this older generation of Democrats is not as ""centrist"" as they think.  Universal Health Care has been the goal for decades.   Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid has always been the front line of the battle and its always been something that Democrats fought for every fucking election since before I can remember.

I only hear rage against Biden from this generation who know nothing but generalizations of life from the 80's and 90's.  The deficit debate is all but forgotten by Sanders and Warren with their multi-trillion dollar plans.  This article makes me prefer Biden to them, to be honest."
