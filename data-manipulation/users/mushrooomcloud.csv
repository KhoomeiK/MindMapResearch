depression,fcp5kgh,t1_fcp58jo,1577851180.0,I'm sorry :( you're not alone.
depression,fcp4zw2,t3_eicz9e,1577850649.0," This sounds like a very hard place to be. I'm so sorry. Therapy was really helpful for me. I honestly need to go back, bad. 

If you can figure out how to ask, in your own way, in your own time... It may help. And it might be worth that risk. 

I wish you all the best."
depression,fcp4i6j,t1_fcp43bj,1577850206.0,"The only thing that really makes me smile these days is my dog. I have to fake bring happy for my husband. He also suffers from depression and I know it really effects him when I'm down. 

Exhausting is the perfect word."
depression,fcp3zbf,t1_fcp2n8k,1577849752.0,Thanks for your support and kind words. I hope your new year is amazing too.
depression,fcp3jzm,t3_eid13d,1577849384.0,"I also have fibro, literally noooo energy, don't enjoy anything, no sex drive, all the things. I take paxil and it has helped me build a life I never though I'd have. I was doing so well for awhile, generally really happy, for the first time in my life. Now it's gone. 

I probably need to go back to therapy but money is tight. 

I hope you find some answers and relief. If you do, please share."
depression,fcp31tv,t3_eid32v,1577848944.0,"I TOTALLY feel this way. I keep wondering, is this the day I snap and quit my job and end up having to move in with my parents like I've always feared? But that wouldn't help me, so I keep smiling..."
depression,fcp2t7u,t1_fcp239x,1577848736.0,"At work I have to smile because I work with people. And they don't deserve a shitty, angry me. They didn't do anything wrong. It's hard to keep it up though. The act itself makes me so upset because I have to be invisible in my pain."
depression,fcp17su,t3_ei19sk,1577847348.0,"I'm spending it alone. My husband left for camping today. He forgot to tell me he's going to be gone for two weeks. I thought my friend was coming over but we had our wires crossed and she meant the following day. She just sent me a photo of her at a party. Usually I wouldn't even care, but I've been so low lately. There is no way I could ever commit suicide because it would destroy my mom, but I seriously don't enjoy living very much right now and am feeling so trapped. I work to pay for my life I don't enjoy and my health makes work really hard for me. I keep thinking, 'I'm working soo hard... But for what?' 

If I wasn't so tired and broke, I'd break everything I own right now."
NonBinaryTalk,f9oymh8,t3_e36jrm,1575516877.0,"I've always hated my first and middle names as they are super feminine. I'm in the process of trying to change my name to my father's middle name, which is very gender neutral. My mother is very upset and very offended which is super strange because she's always been really cool with me dating men or women, people who identify as queer or otherwise, whoever. However, I don't think she acknowledges that I am NB. I am afab and am with someone amab so she probably just thinks of me as straight *facepalm*. Anyway, I definitely have hated my name and cringe when I hear it. It conjures up images in my head of a baby girl in a pink blanket-- something I have never connected with. BUT! It's totally okay to not dislike your name. We are all so unique :)"
