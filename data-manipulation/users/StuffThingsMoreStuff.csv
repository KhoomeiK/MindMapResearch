politics,fegfyld,t1_fegaggo,1579091463.0,"No you don't. You are not taxed at that high. Please stop spreading FUD.

The USA uses a sliding tax system of brackets. Each bracket of money is taxed at a different rate. At 100,000 the max bracket is 24%, but that only applies to the 15,000 of your income. 

At 100,000 your tax rate is almost certainly 17% on the whole. Which is under 20,000.

And this is all applied you take out all your non taxible income such as benefits  401k or IRA, the standard deductions, etc... which at 100,000 you are for sure doing. This will lower your tax rate even more."

movies,fdjhcb2,t1_fdj33zd,1578470837.0,"This. Also Netflix and the like will not support TV apps for your model forever. My parents TV support for Netflix and prime is being dropped. Perfectly good TV, they won't upgrade for a while, so I got them a roku and all the goodness it entails."
science,fdftvki,t1_fdfeg2a,1578370086.0,"The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has funded a project to modernize nuclear plant design. The new design call for the plant to run on depleted uranium... Essentially the waste produced from the existing plants. On top of it, it is safe from problems like in Chernobyl and Fukushima due to updates to how the cooling system works. So a safe plant that runs on existing waste. 

They were literally about to build the prototype in china. Then Trump got elected and he shit all over it because of the trade war.

So no new nuclear power plant. :("

todayilearned,fcjxu11,t1_fcjw4dy,1577709763.0,"That too. I'm going to sound like a shill, but Costco is usually cheaper than other stores, mostly due to the bulk nature of their business. So if you are good buying 5 lbs of something instead of 1 lb like usual, you'll save a bunch in the long run.

You pay a membership fee, but you quickly make that back. Hell, between gas, coffee, laundry detergent, and syrup (sounds silly but you can get a 1 lb jug of real maple syrup for the same price as a small jar at the grocery store) you'll make the membership up in like a month.

I also understand that many of their products are only marked up 15% as well, so it all stays reasonable.

But they still run sales / discounts which is where the real savings shine."
todayilearned,fcjugac,t1_fcjr69z,1577705297.0,"Hah. Yup.

Step 1: go to Costco
Step 2: see what's on sale
Step 3: buy that"
