I was once vaguely acquainted with a girl who got pregnant at 15. 
But it has become such a common occurrence for youn girls to get pregnant sometimes years before reaching adulthood that if they made a list of “all underage girls who gave birth” the list would be pages upon pages upon pages long. 

Its sad really. Since of course all those cases constitute a rape since the girls were to young to give informed consent.  (Maybe aside from a handful of romeo and julia exceptions?)"

I think this flatness of their characters mostly annoys me for one reason. I loved the big season arcs in RTD/moffat time. The Saxon arc, badwolf arc, heck even the cracks in time was nice enough.

Chibnall immediately said at the start of season 11: “there will be no season story arc, i want to focus on developing the characters first. The dynamic between the characters and their growth will be the only arc”

And i was sad but accepted that, knowing that the characters are important too.

BUT THEN he did absolutely nothing with the character’s arcs! Yaz is nonexistent. She’s maybe friends with Ryan which is slowly turning into a brother/sister relationship thing. But there are just no consequences to her character. Her job as a police officer is wayyy in the background. He parents pop up only when useful to the plot.

Ryan occasionally mentions his dyspraxia but nothing really changes on that front either and its only for plot convenience. And he is sortof-maybe-occasionally building a friendship/relationship with yaz and becoming more accepting of Graham as his family.

Graham was the best i guess... they made him mourn Grace, made him try to connect with Ryan as a granddad, basically be the ‘dad’ of everyone. I really sortof like graham! I like him as the comedic character. He has some great one-liners But still i thought his mourning arc was way too rushed and only used for plot reasons like in It Takes You Away in order to allow Walsh to let his funny side shine.

Even the doctor herself doesnt have any real growth. Her character is one-note from ep1 to the finale of her first season. Even the start of this second season and the disappearance of Gallifrey one lets her show character growth in tiny bursts at the start and end of the episodes, but most of these past 4 episodes her character is exactly the same as last season. 

Think back to Eccleston or Smith and see how much they changed from ep1 to the finale of their first season. Even Capaldi changed quite a bit from regeneration to the last ep of his first season. There is no development in Jodie's doctor. There is nothing she cannot do in ep1 that she learns to do before the end of the season. No character flaws that are solved, no discoveries that tell us she moved forward (or even backward) from that first episode.

Basically: i would have been willing to accept the lack of a season arc. I understand those long-con plot things are a bitch to keep track of. Reportedly the Saxon arc was a nightmare to keep track of for the showrunners. Especially for a director who is so new to the show that may be too much to ask.  
But then by god, if you arent gonna give me a story arc, you are supposed to give me an amazeballs character development arc!

That is why i hate this seasons characters. Not because i hate mandip gill or her acting, not because i hate Tosin or his acting, not because i dislike having a female doctor.

But because Chibnall promised me character development in exchange for forgetting about a big story arc and he did not deliver on his promise."

I mean, I was raised Roman Catholic myself. I even went to a primary school that had ""Roman Catholic"" in it's name. 

Now i cannot swear to the fact that they taught me about Islam specifically. I dont think they did to be honest. But we did talk about Arabia, about the history of the middle east, we learned that the first farms were in villages around the rivers in the middle east. 

We probably didnt learn about the Koran or about Mohammed, but that could also very well be because we were kids, not because it was a religious school.

&#x200B;

I think we did cover, at least at a basic level, how Judaism worked. And we learned about different forms of Christianity such as Protestantism, Calvinism, Lutheranism. I think we connected it to the differences visible between those and the catholic faith, but still... we did talk about it. I think we may have even learned some very basic ideas of Buddhism? 

&#x200B;

Basically: I dont see the harm in a child learning about different faiths. What do these parents worry about? Are they afraid the child will think Islam sounds like a ""more fun religion"" and walk away from the family faith? If the parents are really worried that might happen then perhaps they should have a little more, dare I say it, Faith in their faith. 

And actually: if the parents are really really adamant their kid must be X religion because X religion is the bestest religion evah!, then why not let them learn about all the ""bad"" religions? If these parents are adamant their kid must be catholic and are willing to do anything to get that done, then why not teach the kid about Islam on an early age, and teach the kid the things that ( In the parents perspective) are ""wrong"" with islam that mean the catholic faith is best. 

&#x200B;

It seems to me like teaching the kids about all religions would serve these parents much better than not letting the kid learn. 

Cause kids are perceptive, this daughter has probably noticed that she is not allowed to learn about one topic that her classmates do study. So apples to oranges that kid is gonna go looking for info on Islam by herself. Cause kids are curious like that."

GenderCritical,ff48xcg,t3_eoyvmp,1579558115.0,"Sorry bit late to the party.

I've been having mixed feelings about that myself recently.

I really want to support all women,  regardless of how confused they are and if they subscribe to trans ideologies or not. I do not fear TiFs. I do not hate TiFs.

But i also am starting to find myself less and less able to support them. 

I think another commenter said something smart about wanting to support but not enable them. Sure, i want the help TiFs, but i will never support their transness.

I am aware that there is a good chance a TiF became that way due to some for of abuse or ill treatment by men, denial of lesbianism or general fear of being a woman in our current society. And i feel sorry for them because of it.

But i will not defy logic to support them. I know these women are vulnerable, but they will net be helped by me supporting their delusion. I respect them as women, not as the men they try to be.

And frankly, recently a few TiFs have done really destructive things i heard on the grapevine? I got some private messages here on Reddit from TiFs who came out of the gate very strongly right away. Shouting the odds at me about how 'inconsistent' i am because I dó support transed women, but do not support transed men. Trying to explain to these women that i support them because, as a  feminist, i stand up for all women, falls on deaf ears. They were so stuck in their beliefs. They just did not understand that i am not necessarily ""trans exclusionary"" just ""male exclusionary"". 

Some of these non-binary women/transed women can be very very hard to deal with, they can aggressively refuse any help or kindness because ""aaah awful terf!!!"".

I guess i must shamefully admit my patience with TiFs is starting to wear thin. I still support them as women, but many of them simply do not want help, they are too deep in the trans mytholgy. And at that point i stop supporting them."
GenderCritical,ff2n63c,t3_er8x1w,1579514351.0,"They had unisex toilets at the university i attended for one semester in australia. 
Thank heaven they were in addition to and not a replacement of female and male toilets, so i was still able to just go to female toilets. 

I didn’t mind that so much because it doesn’t really change anything for me and might even make it better. If real women can just visit female toilets and enbies and transies and other gendersweirds can go to unisex toilets it might make it just a tiny bit more normal. 

But removing female toilets and replacing them with unisex-only? No thanks!

It was a very very progressive university anyway. My first week living in campus accommodation we had to learn everyones pronouns. Back then i was still a people pleaser and pretty much SJW.

Shuffles_Deck,fendj4r,t1_fejgv8i,1579282371.0,"Uhm to be a nomad you do have to know some basic stuff about animal husbandry and not overhunting and about finding watersources.

But let's agree for arguments sake that you are completely right.

If white people really, truly fórced the africans to stop being nomads, all the while Africans really really wanted to go back to being nomads. Let's say the Africans loved being nomads and hated the farms and all the modern stuff white people built.

&#x200B;

Then why, after the white people left, did they not go back to being nomads? Leave the farms to die off by themselves. Leave the waterpumps and other modern stuff behind to rust and rot and go back into the desert with the farm animals? leave the houses to crumble and move back into their tents. 

&#x200B;

If they truly don't know how to manage a water system ( which i immediately believe. They had no clue how modern stuff worked) and arent intersted in learning. Then why did they not just go back to what they dó understand and go back to being nomads? 

Why then do they beg the white people to come back and save their farms and help them keep up the modern way of life?

&#x200B;

Maybe, just maybe, they figured out that it's a lot nicer to live in a house with aircon than a windy tent. Maybe they figured out that it's a lot less effort to look after livestock on a well irrigated field than walk miles  every day hoping to find a desert pond of water. And also, maybe they were just too lazy to really work to learn how white settlers built and maintained all those comforts.

&#x200B;

If they used to be so great at being nomads before ""white people ruined everything"", and they secretly wanted to be nomads all along, so they were never interested in living on farms and taking care of housing and water management, then why not go back to being nomads as soon as the whites left? 

&#x200B;

Cause it sounds to me like they would much rather profit from white management and not do anything themselves.

&#x200B;

So i guess you and i agree on one thing: white people should defintely leave africa. Leave them to their own devices. Take everything with us, our evil evil white things such as banks including their access to all white worldwide banking systems and monetary grants, powerplants, seaports including losing all transport to and from white countries, airports, universities including all white teachers, hospitals including all white doctors and all white people's medicine, construction ideas, water management ideas. 

We return africa to the african people  in exactly the way we found it when evil evil white people first arrived: empty and devoid of any major civilizations.  Let all the whites leave africa to the africans! But that means that they can never whine again about how ""evil white people are ruining our country"" because from the moment every white person has left the continent, they are on their own! If they know better, let them show it!"
DeathInParadiseBBC,fenaalm,t1_fel0d5q,1579280380.0,"I was expecting that the mouse was dead and in some way or another the killer had poisoned the mouse also, probably accidentally, revealing somehow that the arsenic was not in the soda, but in something else that a mouse could eat.

TrollGC,fen5oxt,t1_fen4du1,1579277539.0,"Yeah... 
i mean i know that the gendered brain stuff is all hokum. 

But honestly, if it were true, that would present a big problem for the transies. Which i would be fine with. 
Because if they really get their wish, if they can really convince doctors that “I am a woman because my brain is female” and doctors believed that. 

Then that would present a problem for them. Because if it cán be medically proven that you have a medical condition, “wrong-gendered-brain condition”. In this case. Then it stands to reason that, before any treatment by a doctor can be prescribed, the doctors would need to screen each persons brain to see if they were assigned  the wrong brain at birth or some shit. Before handing out the titty skittles. No more free pills, no more free Testosterone, no dick chopping or building, no free boob jobs, zip, nada! Until you get your brain checked and get proof that you really have the wrong brain!

Now lets say if, and its a big if, if there really were cases of “wrong gendered brain in wrong body” leading to those people being trans. Then i swear to god  i would accept that. 
But lets be fair: how many of the current trans warriors would actually qualify?  If we scanned the brain of every single transie with the magical nonexistent “brain sex finding machine”, how many of the transies would actually háve the wrong brain? A tiny percentage i think.  
How many are just fetishists, attention seekers, predators?  A whole lot probably. 

So even íf brain sex was a thing. That would not be a good thing for the transies. Because it could prove to them that 90% of them do not in fact have the wrong brain. And that would obviously be invalidating. They would just cry “GATEKEEPING! hatespeech!” And then never talk about the brain sex thing again."
TrollGC,fen3qqg,t1_fen37gv,1579276307.0,"Yeah i feel much the same. 
I actually replied to that saying:

lol no they are not!  And even íf there were any proof of that being a fact, and if the brain was proof of a person being trans, would that not mean anyone calling themselves trans would have to be required to subject to an intensive brain scan test before they would be allowed to transition?

Cause if the brain is what makes you trans, then the medical field should test that before allowing anyone to transition. 

But of course the brain isnt “male or female”. A brain is only gendered the same way lungs and livers are gendered: if you are a male your lungs are male etc."

doctorwho,femp4b8,t3_ensr3s,1579265354.0,"I was thinking about a few similarities this had to far to the previous season’s second episode “Ghost Monument”  (GM)

Theres is a teleport involved both times. Though technically last season the teleport took place at the end of episode 1 and not really at the start of GM itself.  But both times the teleport is unexpected and the gang isnt fully aware where they ended up, what planet. 

Both episodes have Tardis separation. 

I got the same kind of vibes from Kane and Vorm that i got from Epzo and Angstrom. 

The planet they are on is deadly. Being on the surface too long will kill you. 

“The sunlight is deadly”. Appears in both episodes. 

Both planets contain mysterious deadly creatures. (Dregs in O55 and the bandage strip-creatures and robot things in GM)

Ryan tries blowing things up. In GM with a gun and in O55 with a bomb. 

They get in a vehicle that takes them part-way across the deadly surface.  Boat in GM, truck/bus in O55.  

In both episodes they use tunnels under the suface fo get away from the deadly stuff on the surface. But then the monsters (dregs, robots or bandaid creatures) also show up in the tunnels. They get attacked in the tunnels. 
They learn new information in the tunnels. 
I even thought the hatch door to get into the tunnels in O55 looked extremely similar to the one in GM. Prop recycling maybe? I may meed to rewatch. 
There are stairs involved, which Ryan struggles with. 

The solution is blowing stuff (read: the monsters) up. Cigar in GM, bomb in O55. 

Kane wants to make money with the resort and the planet to give to her daughter. Angstrom wanted to win the race to save her family too. 


Even the trailer for next week sortof fits the pattern of last season: spoilers about the trailer below!



The episode after GM was about Rosa parks, a famous historical American figure. 
The trailer after O55 showed Nikola tesla. Another famous historical American figure. 


Of course O55 had a lot more characters. And there are plenty of differences between the episodes. The similarities just got stuck in my head a bit."
