This one of the few instances I'd considering pirating, since it isn't that you don't *want* to pay, you just can't afford to pay a gigantic amount for it (and then pay for it if/when it becomes available to buy).

There *can't* be equality in this situation because men obviously can't get pregnant. Pregnant women face higher levels of domestic violence, are less likely to get hired for jobs and sometimes get fired for being pregnant (yeah, yeah, it's illegal, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen). They may well not get to take maternity leave, or only a small amount, because they can't afford to not work- some women have to go back while they're still healing *from giving birth* (and even longer if it was a c-section). So until men face those issues or women face none of them, the situations cannot be treated the exact same way. They just can't.

I have been dealing with health issues for 26 years now, since I was 9.

This is not at all uncommon for rare diseases, and there are people who have definitely gone through more. I rarely bring up my full experience because honestly, it's fucking depressing to talk about.

Is my experience with pee tests universal? Certainly not. But I do have more experience than your average bear when it comes to the medical system in the U.S (4/10, would not recommend).

I was mot drugged. *You* bring things to entertain and distract them, and you engage with them. If it's babies and toddlers who are too young to be able to pop their ears, causing them literal pain, that's one thing. Drugging your kids because you can't be arsed to even try to parent them isn't ok. (Doctors can also be wrong in what they suggest. They aren't infallible.)

Adults get to *choose* to have a drink. Children don't have a choice in the matter. And honestly, I think alcohol on planes is a terrible idea. I feel awful for the poor flight attendants that have to deal with all the drunks."
AmItheAsshole,fdm3uss,t1_fdj87a1,1578539161.0,"You can only get 20 Zofran at a time anyway, though I've never been given the answer of *why.* It isn't something you can abuse, so it makes no sense. I've had tons of doctors who wouldn't try and treat mine. A *huge* amount of doctors don't take women's health problems and pain seriously, as well as if you're overweight- that's not speculation, research has actually shown that.

Something I've had work for my nausea a fair amount of the time is peppermint essential oils (not MLM crap, just from a drugstore or Amazon). I use it most frequently while waiting for my Zofran to kick in. Just put a bit on a cottonball or paper towel, hold it under your nose breathe in it in.

Phenergan has also worked for me in the past and definitely recommend if Zofran doesn't work. Compazine is what a lot of doctors try first and seems to work well for many people (I'm allergic, so no-go for me). The doctors you've seen are all assholes for refusing to try to treat it and I wish you better docs in the future!"
AmItheAsshole,fdlz6pk,t1_fdibn0y,1578535998.0,"Also recommend Phenergan.

Edit: Peppermint essential oil can also help with nausea. I couldn't stop violently dry heaving after a surgery and the Zofran wasn't helping (I'm allergic to compazine), which had happened before. The surgeon was supposed to write in IV Phenergan (they didn't know that was dangerous to give as an IV, but is ok with a PICC line) but he didn't, and the nurses were trying to get hold of *any* doctor because it was that bad. But then a nurse came in with a little of it on a cottonball. The dry heaving stop within a couple minutes. I bring my own little bottle now, whenever I have surgery, just in case."
AmItheAsshole,fdlyweh,t1_fdixfjg,1578535801.0,"Even if the child has an invisibility disability, that's still absolutely no excuse for her father to ignore her and play with his phone. It's on parents to at least *try* to minimize their child's impact on other people, whether the kid is neurotypical or not. People are a lot more forgiving when they see that people are actually trying to deal with what's happening."
AmItheAsshole,fdly1dn,t1_fdiuzj6,1578535215.0,"I flew throughout my entire childhood, starting when I was 6 weeks old- a lot of them transatlantic flights, too- and I didn't behave like this. All because my mom brought things to keep me entertained and preoccupied. (This was before smartphones and tablets. Before I was old enough to color, I apparently had loads of fun with bandaids and dental floss... I should really ask how she figured out I had fun with that.) With toddlers, that can be a difficult thing to do, but you actually have to *try.* That means actually engaging with the child, not telling them to settle and going back to staring at your phone. People need to take fucking responsibility for their own children. So absolutely NTA.

I agree with the people who've said maybe the dad and kid could try switching seats but honestly, it's not on the OP to control someone else's child. I absolutely *disagree* with people saying the nausea/throwing up is the OP's problem to deal with, and assuming he hasn't even tried other methods to deal with this. He said what does help but it doesn't mean he *hasn't* tried anything else. It's more likely he just didn't find the need to list what hadn't worked for him."

The problem here is that neither of them actually did that. It sucks that she's getting frozen out when this is an issue *both* of them created.

There's more than one type of intimacy- sexual intimacy isn't the only type that exists. Seriously, google the definition."

It's really the ones that hand wave it away, who can't-or won't- sit down and explain things, doesn't go over any potential treatments, or gets mad at you if you ask clarifying questions instead of just taking their word for it, that are the problem.

I was only a kid at the time, so I don't know what the whole protocol was (and it's probably changed), but in Italy a 4-6 week quarantine was a big part. There were so fucking many stray dogs there (the American military... we really didn't help. New assignment would come in and instead of trying to take the animals with them, would just dump them on the street) but absolutely nobody was afraid of rabies. I wish I remembered how long it had been since they had an outbreak, but I think it was a couple decades.

Rabies is why Australia went at Johnny Depp and Amber Heard when they smuggled their dogs in."

Kids, especially younger ones, are *hugely* sensitive to what's fair or unfair, even if they don't always understand the logic behind some of it. (Shit, tons many *adults* revert to ""it's not fair!"")

If nothing else, I'd occasionally plan some other things and occasionally invite the half-brother along. As they get older, when there's less young child herding, inviting him to Disneyland a couple times a year (so long as the ex pays), isn't a terrible idea."
JustNoSO,fdjc4aa,t1_fdi2yzq,1578464881.0,"I think you may have a bit of a distorted view of mother/son relationships. In a healthy relationship, there's no need to ""break-up"" with a parent because you don't have to choose one relationship and cut-off the other. The mother may no longer be the center of the universe, true, but again, that's not a break-up. If a mother is treating a male child the way a girlfriend would, enough so that putting boundaries in place, that is a *huge* red flag. Frankly, I see no healthly relationships here. At all."
