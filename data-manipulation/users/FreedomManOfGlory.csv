NoFap,fff3hge,t3_etamb7,1579874702.0,"Your brain's reward cycle is a central part of it. It will always be a problem if you don't learn self control and actively avoid any things that take advantage of this part of your brain. Whether you're addicted to PMO or anyhing else doesn't really make any difference. You can just as well replace one addiction with another.

Your brain will change on really long streaks of 1 to 3+ months and not all of those changes will get reversed if you relapse once. But they will if you keep doing it. There will never be a point where you can just go back to your old ways and not get any of the side effects you used to get. So see this is making a lasting change in your life. If you're not willing to do that, then you will always end up addicted again, whether to PMO or to anything else."
selfimprovement,fff35x7,t3_etadg4,1579874448.0,"Just stop doing it. Realize that anything you do is a choice. And if you don't choose your actions but just do what you're always doing, then you are still making a choice. You basically choose not to choose and to put your life in the hands of fate and society.

Start paying attention to your thoughts. Try to observe them from an outsid perspective, to see them for what they really are. What are they? Just thoughts, nothing more. Same as feelings they come and go. So why let them control you?

When you notice that a negative thought comes up, like one about comparing yourself to someone else, or where you start obsessively focussing on something ""bad"" about yourself, just recognize it for what it is. And recognize that you can stop thinking those thoughts at any time. This realization will allow you to change them and then all you need to do is to focus on something else. Don't try not to think of it, just put your attention on something else completely. And keep observing your thoughts so that you catch yourself every time that such negative thoughts come up.

If you do this consistently for some time the habit will change and so you won't have to pay attention all the time anymore, and at the same time your mind will also come up with much fewer negative thoughts as well. But still pay attention to what is going through your head so that your mind can't take you over again. Otherwise you'll end up back where you started.

Look up a guide for mindfulness meditation and start practicing it daily, in addition to observing your thoughts throughout the day. It will help as well."
NoFap,fff2m8q,t3_etah6p,1579874020.0,"Where exactly did you hear those stories? Cause all I usually see on here are guys worrying about not lasting very long on a long Nofap streak.

What you could do is to learn to have non ejaculatory orgasms. Which is actually pretty easy and quick to learn. Might be easier for some than for others of course but just google for a guide for multiple orgasms for men and practice what it says.

But beyond that, you gotta decide what it is that you want. You don't like feeling drained after having sex but at the same time you seem to also want to do it as much as you can. Do you where your dilemma is? Think a bit about what you really want and what it more important to you. Ultimately if you still see sex as the most valuable thing there is in life, then you're still addicted to it and pleasure in general. So will you really care about being at your best when you're presented with the opportunity to have sex again? Decide what it is that you actually want because you can't have everything. One path might bring you peace and freedom and with that control over your life and your behavior. While the other will ensure that you can only be happy whenever you indulge in pleasurable things. And so you will always need more because you can never be satisfied."
Stronglifts5x5,fff216r,t3_etagt9,1579873551.0,"Just take some rest and you should be fine. That was a pretty big jump and if you're a complete beginner and weigh only 51kg, then you'd probably be best off increasing the weight on deadlifts in 2.5kg steps as well, same as on the other exercises.

But are you sure you wanted to do the deadlifts with 30kg? Cause the program recommends 40kg as the starting weight, simply because it's hard to do with anything smaller than 10kg plates. If you use 5kg plates then you'd have to put a lot of plates below the bar to get it to a proper height. I normally use 3 per side when rowing 30kg."
Stronglifts5x5,fff1p8a,t1_fff0drk,1579873275.0,"I used to squat up to 127.5kg for 5 reps at some point while benching up to 70kg or so. Like I said, there's nothing too unusual about your numbers and different people will have slightly different numbers for all exercises. Some guys might be able to squat a lot while others might have a very weak squat but can bench tons. Don't obsess over numbers. Focus on doing your workouts properly.

It's not about doing as much as you can. Benching more won't necessarily get you better results. If you already are lifting at your limits then you should require sufficient recovery. But what have you been doing exactly in the past weeks? Have you plateaued completely on the bench press or are you still slowly making press? If yes then you really have no reason to worry. And if you have started stalling, then how are you dealing with it? Do you keep trying to lift the same weight again and again or are you doing deloads as the program advises you to do?

That is why I said that you should focus on perfect form and stick to the program. There's a lot of things you can do wrong or suboptimally, just by not reading up on how to do things properly. And guys get ideas like yours all the time. Recently one guy asked if if's fine to do all the lifts on each training day. The program is designed the way it is for a reason, so if you're a beginner and don't know why exactly it's designed the way it is, then you probably shouldn't mess with it. Focus instead on learning how to do it all properly and learning about why you are supposed to do all these things in a very specific way.

Then once you know all that you're free to experiment to see what works better for you. But if you change too many things at once you might mess everything up and might not even know what's causing what. So I'd wait at least until you've really started stalling on all or most lifts. Otherwise if you're already lifting at your limits, how long do your workouts take? How much rest do you need between sets? Cause just the 3 basic exercises can already take you up to 1.5 hours, if not more, to get through. So adding more once you've reached that point is very counter productive. And if it feels like you can do way more than what you're doing now, then you probably aren't quite near your limits yet.

Also check the height of the bench the next time you're there. A fixed height for the bar sounds like a really stupid thing and the only ones I've seen that had that also had multiple pins so you could choose the height that works for you. If there is only 1 height, then I'd bet it's way too low as even the smallest guy has to still be able to unrack the bar. And that's pretty bad and could be affecting your lifts. But your OHP is equally weak, or even weaker I'd say, so maybe it's just your arms that lack strength. And maybe you could change that by training them more, but you are gonna do that anyway if you keep going. Don't obsess over getting results quick. Focus more on staying on track and doing things properly instead. And don't ignore recovery."
carnivore,fff0df4,t3_et9yfo,1579872158.0,"What exactly is the fat content of the meat you're eating? Your sentence towards the end is pretty weird because meat already contains fat and protein. So if you can buy meat with a high enough fat content, then you might not need to add any more fat to that. But personally I usually eat ground beef with around 19% fat content and I add some butter to that. Meaning that I eat 50g of butter together with 500g of ground beef. And if I don't add the butter I don't feel as sated. So fat content should be high and if you're not sure about it, then chances are it's lower than you think.

As for stools specifically, maybe fat content might have something to do with it. From my personal experience, when I switched from keto to carnivore my stool raw really rough for a few days, but then things normalized and my main issue after that was that I was getting frequent diarrhea. Which seems to have been caused by the large amounts of fatty meat, as I was consuming very similar amounts of fat and overall calories as I was before on keto. And over time this issue has disappeared as my body has adjusted. Maybe it just takes a bit longer for you or maybe eating more fat might help. But if you already know that it started happening right after that colonoscopy, then maybe you should look into what connection there might be to your problems."
Stronglifts5x5,ffezuse,t3_et9ojd,1579871692.0,"Would you even get any benefit from it on a low rep strength routine? Isn't the main benefit that it allows you to do more reps with lighther weights, the way bodybuilders train? Just eat more fatty meat is what I'd recommend. It should contain a decent amount of creatine anyway."
ketoscience,ffezpi5,t1_ffexzx7,1579871558.0,"Yeah, I've heard this claim about other nuts being potentially better before. The main issue with nuts though is that they're full of oxalates, and those are not healthy for us. When I switched to carnivore I started getting some heavy buildup on the inside of front teeth in my lower jaw. As someone mentioned to me that might have been caused by my body dumping oxalates. Not sure why it wasn't doing that before. Could it be only because I've stopped eating any?

Over time this has stopped though and by now the buildup has mostly disappeared again. But looking back now I think that it might really have had to do with oxalates, which my body was excreting through saliva and maybe in other ways as well. Anyways, that stuff's not good for you and all plant foods ultimately contain some toxins and anti nutrients. That's the main reason for switching to carnivore. And for some people this makes a huge difference because they're highly affected by all those toxins, while others might not be as affected by them yet, but it doesn't meant that this can't change with time. And as you can hear from many vegans who had to give up their diet, due to serious health that were a result of the diet, consuming large amounts of vegetables can really mess up your health and digestion. And fiber can be pretty bad, too.

Again, different people are affected differently but if you look around you you might find that even people who seem pretty healthy tend to gain weight and get more and more sick the older they get. Society and even our medical industry would like us to believe that it's just part of being human, as if it was unavoidable. But if you've done your research on keto then you should know that most of those health issues are a result of your modern diet. And carnivore is really just the next step. If you have no issues with plant foods or vegetables right now, then it might feel like you've just cut something out that you don't need in any way, as it was for me mainly. But you should also consider that if something is causing serious issues for other people, then it might be affecting you as well, just in a more subtle way. And that over time this effect might become more and more pronounced. And it's easy to not notice this at all as life happens and changes often happen very slowly over many years.

Anyways, just something to consider. There's still plenty of folks that will try to convince you that even a healthy carb based diet can be perfectly healthy. But we know that's not really true. And your expectations play a big role in this as well. I always aim for optimal results with anything I do while others try to half ass everything and are fine with mediocre results. Until they start suffering some serious negative effects, which is usually the case sooner or later. But for a while everything might seem perfectly fine, same as even vegans usually seem to feel great for the first up to 6 months or so. Eventually thinks start to turn around though."
Stronglifts5x5,ffeyru8,t3_et7sxq,1579870691.0,"You seem to have some weird idea about benching, and probably the same obsession that most guys in the gym have. Just looking at your numbers your OHP is extremely weak as well but you didn't mention that. But your row is only 10kg higher than your bench, which seems fine to me. I used to row about 5-7.5kg more than I could bench. About 72.5kg on the bench press and 77.5kg on rows at around 63kg bodyweight when I last worked my way up to my max.

So all in all I don't see much of an issue here. You're not supposed to bench anything close to what you can squat. Only gym bros who mainly train their upper body might be able to do that. So my advice would be to just keep at it and to stick to the program and to maybe read up on how to do all the lifts with perfect form. The official site should have some pretty good info on that.

Are you setting the height on the bench properly? That's one thing that pretty much 100% of guys in the gym do wrong, setting it too low. And on a strength program like this it would probably also mess up your shoulders pretty bad, while forcing you to lift a really heavy weight from a lowered position. Ideal would be so that you can unrack the bar with straight arms. Look into what you might be doing wrong or not optimally. If anything you're squatting too much on this program, not doing too little of the other exercises."
ketoscience,ffeu946,t1_ffeobpl,1579865786.0,"Well, the fact that I don't have to eat stuff I have no use for is already a benefit to me. And I never was big on vegetables anyway. Before I made the switch I was pretty much only eating some cucumber or tomatoes with my meals, and mainly for flavor. So cutting those out wasn't really a big deal.

But what made a difference was cutting out the peanuts which I was still eating in large amounts daily. About 100-200g per day after my normal meals, which made OMAD pretty easy. Now on carnivore I had to start eating two meals cause eating 1kg of ground beef in one sitting is not very enjoyable. But last year I started studying at university again and started eating peanuts again cause they were the only keto friendly food I could bring with me. This was about half a year or so since I've switched to carnivore. But when I started eating them again I could feel some pressure and a generally uncomfortable feeling in my heart and chest. It just really didn't feel to healthy. Not sure how much of that might be due to me not being used to plant foods anymore, but part of it was probably just that you don't notice these kind of subtle effects if you've been on a mainly plant based diet your whole life, as most people are today. So cutting all plant foods out for some time will show you these kind of things if you do consume any again.

For that alone I would recommend trying it at least for a few months or so. Ultimately you don't really have anything to lose. You really don't need vegetables for anything. Meat and animal products contain everything you need. And you might be better off without fiber. It's also not that my stools are smaller but that I only have to go once or twice per week, while eating a pretty big caloric surplus. But maybe you'll experience some benefits, even if they are slight. And if not you might still go back to eating some plants again, if you still want to.

Although it isn't that easy to just eat some plant foods at times whenever you feel like it. We seem heavily reliant on gut bacteria for digesting plant foods and once those have died off due to lack of plant foods in your diet, then you'll have trouble digesting them. Which you can probably overcome again with time, but indulging in plant foods occasionally doesn't seem to work too well for most peope who've tried it."
carnivore,ffenqrm,t1_ffe252k,1579856286.0,That is quite cheap since I pay not much less for a kg of grain fed ground beef here in Germany. But how fatty is it? I assume you're not getting ribeyes for that price.
NoFap,ffennaj,t1_ffedidi,1579856140.0,"You are again falling into the trap of seeking fulfillment in things or relationships. Do you really think that ""being loved"" would change anything for you? Who wants that? You or your ego? The ego loves that kind of thing: fame, recognition, admiration from others. But to you, does it really matter what anyone thinks of you? Will it improve your life somehow if you have someone who is in love with you?

There is nothing wrong with wanting to change things in your life but the first thing you need to do is to accept everything the way it is. That doesn't mean not wanting to change it anymore. But you have to accept that this is how it is right now, and maybe it'll stay that way for some time longer, or even forever. But that's okay because right now, if you can become fully present, are there really any problems in your life?

Whenever you think about the things that are wrong or missing in your life you are making them into a problem. When in reality it's just how things are, neither good nor bad. And if you look at them objectively you should see them as well. So accept everything first. And then from there you can look at everything objectively and consciously decide which things maybe you should do something about and which not. And if you can't or don't want to do something about them, then just accept them and stop turning them into a problem. Same thing with those that you do want to change. Accept them and focus on the steps you need to take to make the change happen. That way you can improve your life and achieve great things without becoming invested in the end result, and without turning everything into a problem that you need to get away from.

Because ultimately nothing you do will really change anything for you. You will still be the same person, no matter how rich you are or whether you have friends of family or not. And when you realize that and stop seeking fulfillment in such things then you'll be free to enjoy all these things but you'll no longer be reliant on them for happiness and peace.

orthotropics,ffen4jz,t1_ffdfhvi,1579855374.0,"Who knows what role chewing meat really plays in this? What Price found is that the closer a tribe was to eating our natural diet, which is a meat based one, the healthier they were overall and that also went hand in hand with proper facial development and zero tooth decay. Is meat harder to chew than soft plant foods? Sure. But could this really be the main factor when it comes to proper facial development? Just chewing food for maybe up to an hour per day when you're not using your jaw muscles at all the rest of the day? To me it seems like proper nutrition plays the bigger role in this. But if you can find someone who has grown up on a plant based diet and has a perfectly developed face from eating lots of tough raw vegetables, then that might disprove this."
ketoscience,ffemx6y,t1_ffdotjr,1579855081.0,"I originally found out about it when I was doing my research on keto before making the switch to it. But of course back then I found it hard to believe that you could really be healthy without eating any vegetables at all. So I spent about 3/4 of a year on keto and learned some more about carnivore during that time, and as I was already eating very few vegetables I thought it's time to try it out. So I did. I didn't really get any further benefits from it unlike many others, aside from not having to hit the toilet every day due to fiber and I do feel better not eating peanuts anymore. But for me it was mostly just the next step, cutting out some more foods that we have no use for. At least not on a meat based diet. Folks on a carb based diet obviously still need their vegetables since there's barely any nutrients found in carb foods."
ketoscience,ffcshf2,t1_ffcqutr,1579806343.0,"You really should enter your data in a calorie calculator online just to get an idea for how much you should be eating. 50g of protein equals 200kcal and 100g of fat equals 900kcal. That's 1100kcal in total. Do you realize how little that is? It's barely enough for a child. No suprise that you've lost that much weight or even muscle mass.

So look up how much you should be eating based on your weight and try to eat at least that much. I know from personal experience that it's very easy to be undereating without even realizing it at all. Eating to satiety is advice that's generally only good for overweight folks at best. For people who are used to eating too much already. But in my view it's always poor advice because it's just too easy to get used to eating too little. Your metabolism will shut down and that will cause problems. And as a result you won't feel hungry and so think that you're eating enough.

Just go through the effort and figure all this stuff out. It really only requires some effort initially anyway. If you're eating mostly the same amounts every day then you'll know after a while how many calories are in it, so it's not like you'd have to count every single calorie you eat all the time.

And if you're up for it, maybe even try the carnivore diet as many people report huge improvements with all kinds of health issues. Maybe cutting out all plant foods will help with your allergies and autoimmune issues. Just make sure to focus on fat content there as well as all the underlying principles are the same as on keto."
NoFap,ffcrpgx,t1_ffc4tp4,1579805881.0,"I don't see why not. Meditation is a practice though, not a magic pill, so it will help you if you turn it into a daily habit. I always recommend mindfulness meditation because it's the most basic form, where you're focussed on observing your thoughts and anything that is going on in your body. You try to observe any thoughts and feelings that come up without letting them take you over. And that ability or the disassociation with your thoughts is where most of the benefits come from. Until you can observe your thoughts like this you are probably convinced that you are your thoughts, so whenver some thought comes up it takes you over and if it's for example an urge for food or PMO, then you might feel like you have to act on it. There is no other choice and that is correct in that situation: because you are unconscious and fully identified with the thought there is no choice. You need to become aware of the fact first that you do have a choice before you can make it.

So start meditating daily and also try to pay some attention to what is going through your mind throughout the day. That will make you more conscious and will lessen the control your mind has over you."

selfimprovement,ffcqrqd,t1_ffc9lcm,1579805297.0,"As the leader you have to be willing to do what's necessary. So if someone is slacking point it out to them. You could use the 3 strikes rule. If you catch them again give them a warning that there will be consequences. And if they do it a third time then it's usually time to let them go. I'm not sure what position you're in exactly but you gotta find the right people for the job. People who slack and waste your time, and maybe even pull down the rest of the team, are not acceptable. And you did pretty much the worst thing you could do in that situation. That is why they don't respect you. You can't be lenient with people like that.

So focus on finding the right people, and if they do a great job then praise them and make sure that they feel appreciated. But don't tolerate any kind of negative behavior. Everyone deserves a chance to change their ways, but if someone shows no interest in doing that, then what's there to do but to let them go and find someone else?

So in short: be wary of any advice medical professionals give you. They don't always have your best interests at heart. A lot of the time they are just doing their job without really thinking about the consequences of their action. But it's your life and your health that's on the line, so you definitely should try to figure out a proper solution for any issues you might have. Don't put your life in the hands of any experts.

So here's another recommendation: look up a guide for mindfulness meditation and start doing it daily. And also look into the ketogenic diet and the carnivore diet as those are very beneficial, especially for the brain. Beyond that work on being more present and start paying attention to your thoughts. By which I mean try to observe them from an outside perspective, as normally they just take you over and your mind has you convinced that you are your thoughts. But if you can realize that you are not your thoughts, then now they lose all power over you. Now you just need to remind yourself of it whenever your mind takes you over again that you are not your mind or your thoughts. Keep working on it and you should see big changes.

Depression is ultimately nothing but compulsive negative thinking. When those thoughts completely take you over and it feels like there is no way out anymore and like you have zero control over your mind, that's when people talk about depression. And you overcome it by disassociating from your thoughts, seeing them for what they are and then consciously deciding to not indulge in negativity. And then you can either choose to think of something positive instead, or just focus on something else or on the present moment.

Either way, those thoughts can only affect you if you let them. You are the one who is giving them power and without you doing that they have no control over you. They are just thoughts, same as emotions they come and go. So start meditating and observing your thoughts and if any thoughts come up that don't serve you, learn to just let them go. If you hang on to them you are again giving them power over you and will end up in a depressed and helpless state again."

But right now you are creating suffering for yourself by constantly imagining this worst case scenario. And all you need to do to stop it is to stop thinking about it. Just decide not to worry about this anymore and then focus on other things. Things that are of more importance right now.

And if your life is actually in danger every day at your job, then why don't you do something about it? Why not learn how to defend yourself for example? Is the constant worrying keeping you from doing the things that would eliminate or at least reduce any danger? What if instead of worrying you would focus on what you can do to improve your situation? Could that possibly completely eliminate this problem? If so, why are you not taking action but keep imagining the worst case scenario instead?"

The way you make it sound it should impact our insulin levels quite a bit since folks on keto and carnivore are consuming large amounts of protein. Yet, as we know this diet will make you very insulin sensitive if you avoid carbs as much as you can, and the carnivore diet does that even more so. Even carbs found in animal foods like milk seem to have a much lower impact on insulin levels than those found in plant foods."
selfimprovement,ffbopud,t3_esiz15,1579776079.0,"Read Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now. Any suffering that you have in your life all comes from you. You are creating it for yourself.

You create suffering for yourself by turning everything into a problem and into something unbearable, something that you shouldn't have to do, etc. So all you need to do is to stop doing that. And suddenly there are no more problems and no suffering, only situations and things that just happen the way they do. Nothing good or bad about them.

So read the book and start practicing meditation. Start paying attention to the thoughts you're creating and try to see them for what they are. That way you'll be able to see clearly whether they serve you or not. And if they don't you can now choose to ignore them by focussing on something else. So practice living more consciously. That is the only place where you really can find meaning in life. Any other goals you can create for yourself can be enjoyable and seem very important to you, but if you only focus on the goal and not on living in the moment and on doing what you need to do right now to get to that goal, then you will always be unfulfilled because you still expect things and the future to make you happy. Which they can't. You can only be happy and unfulfilled right now, by being at peace and free from the mind and through the things you do in this moment."

ketoscience,ffbo3j4,t1_ffbdpnv,1579775153.0,Keto strips only work during the first few weeks of keto adaptation as your body excretes excess ketones then. Later on it becomes more efficient at managing ketone levels so it'll stop excreting them. But how much fat and protein and carbs were you consuming if you managed to stay out of ketosis for such a long period of time? It seems quite unlikely that just eating less than ideal amounts of fat could cause that. If you only eat very lean meat though then things might be different.

I've been testing myself with those strips early on after switching to keto and always had the highest blood ketone levels, just from avoiding all carbs as much as I could. If you stay below 20g per day then you should get optimal results.

Until you do that all you're doing is devolving into a less conscious state, like an animal. That's why people rely on things like alcohol, and the more they rely on those the more their mind will start to drive them crazy and the less control they'll have over it. So methods like this are never a solution for anything.

Do you really wanna compare those numbers to each other, or do you have any data that shows significantly higher numbers?

If you've concerned about low t levels, then you should be more worried about things like phone radiation, as it has been shown to reduce testosterone levels in mice or rats, and about all the plastic that is everywhere around us. Plastic packaging that is always giving off some of its chemical composition onto anything it comes in contact with. Which is especially bad when it comes to beverages, which of course pretty much completely sold in plastic bottles nowadays. All of that stuff has a way bigger impact on us than any estrogen found in meat and animal products, at least from what I've seen. Not to mention the fact alone that most people nowadays eat barely any meat and fat anymore.

But how do you wanna boycott soy businesses? Not eating it would be a good idea, but that's kinda a given on this diet. Beyond that we have no control over what an animal is fed, grass fed beef is hella expensive and not everyone can afford to eat grass fed ribeyes every day. Not to mention that here in Germany we don't even have any grass fed labels. There's literally no indication whatsoever on the packaging of any meat for what the animal has been fed. All we have are organic labels, which mainly means that the grains, soy or whatever that was fed to the animals was raised organically. Cause that makes all the difference.

I am all for regenerative agriculture and returning to a natural way of keeping animals, letting them graze on the pasture and eat their natural food. But we're still a long way away from that, so do what you can with the means you have available right now. Demonizing meat from grain fed animals won't help anyone when most people are still on a standard diet and dying from that."
NoFap,ff9nbyc,t1_ff8ui3j,1579716594.0,"Yeah, there's probably lots of people who have fallen in this trap. It's natural for humans to seek for some higher meaning in life. But most fall for whatever some religious leaders or followers of any ideology are spouting, thinking that if they only follow the rules they'll be happy and fulfilled. And if not in this life then in the afterlife, right? Look behind all the rules and traditions. Try to see them for what they are and think about how they might have developed. Like I said, they surely have served some purpose at some point, and they might even now. But most people are not aware of it and so they might not get the benefits that they are supposed to get from it either.

Ultimately don't develop any negativity towards those practices. And celibacy for example has some benefits. Not quite those that the religions claim, which is mostly ""don't have sex outside of marriage or you'll go to hell"", but sex does drain us of energy. And porn and masturbation are especially harmful and can lead to an addiction similar to hard drugs. So it's not all bullshit. Many things, especially from any thousands years old traditions, do exist for a reason. So like I said, try to look at everything objectively. Don't seek happiness in things and rituals but also don't ignore them just because they might be bullshit. You might still get something out of them.

And the bowing and over politeness in Japanese culture you could see as something that encourages humbleness. But of course as it's become a normal part of their culture it's just become another rule to obey, and now they have rules for how you're supposed to address people of different ages and whether they're superior or inferior to you, etc. Which probably wasn't the reason why they initially came up with it. But you can still practice being humble today, even without bowing or doing any other overt gestures. It's just a state of mind after all. You're not being humble by acting as if you were."

It really sounds like you're trying to shut your mind up by getting dead tired, and it's as healthy as using pills or drugs for it. You really should try meditation instead. It's much healthier for you and will get you much better results."
carnivore,ff8vb6u,t3_ery2wz,1579697311.0,"That's a good question and so far I haven't heard of any upper limits. Your limits are probably mainly based on how much fat you can handle right now, and that limit might increase over time as you get more used to it. But I've seen guys here say they get something like 85% or even 90% of their total calories from fat, which is insane and not achievable in any way if you only ate meat. The last guy that mentioned it said he eats tons of cream and other fat sources to get his fat and I think he was even eating lean meat with it.

But on keto the ideal to aim for is 80% of total calories from fat and if you can get to 75% or so that might already be pretty ideal. And anything above that requires you to add lots of fat in other ways. Or if you're lucky you might be able to buy ground beef with up to 30% fat.

But if you've just started then you'll probably have to adjust to the high fat intake. So if you feel sick after eating tons of fat then you should try to reduce the fat content for now. Or try to eat more frequent meals so your body doesn't get as overwhelmed by large amounts of fat at once. I got frequent diarrhea when I switched to carnivore, even though I had already been on keto for some time before that, eating about the same amounts of fat and total calories. And it took some time until this issue disappeared but by now it's gone completely."
orthotropics,ff8urmu,t3_es9ptr,1579696787.0,"From my personal experience it's something that you'll probably have to work on for a very long time if you've had your tongue naturally rest on the floor of your mouth your whole life. I've been working on this religiously for about a month or so and also expected that I would have changed the habit in a few weeks at most. But that doesn't seem to be how it works. It's not just a habit but rather where you naturally rest your tongue based on your facial structure and neck posture. So they way it seems to me now you need to change those first before mewing can become natural. Until then all you can do is to keep constantly checking to ensure that you're mewing correctly. But as soon as you stop paying any attention to it you'll probably revert to your natural tongue posture again.

But what makes a difference for me is adopting ideal neck posture and tucking my chin in. That tends to automatically push my tongue more towards the roof of my mouth. So I'd say that this might be the best way to make proper tongue posture natural. But of course it requires you to pay attention to ensure that you always have perfect neck posture, so it's a lot of effort as well. And sitting in front of computers or tvs for hours sure won't make that easier. But if you can get used to having ideal neck posture at all times, then I imagine that good tongue posture might also become more natural.

And obviously you should work on your overall body posture as well. Doing a proper full body workout like Stronglifts 5x5 will make adopting good body posture much easier. So that can be pretty easy to achieve, although it'll probably still take time and dedication, depending on where you're coming from as well. But ideal neck posture to me seems like an almost impossible task if you're spending a significant amount of time staring at screens every day. It'll take a lot more effort than fixing the rest of your body posture in that case. And personally I can't say I've really made any progress with my neck posture as whenever I stop focussing on it I slowly return to my usual one. Computers are pretty much the worst thing for our body and neck posture, same as sitting on chairs and couches."
selfimprovement,ff8u1ka,t3_es6m6n,1579696068.0,"Sounds like you've already figured it out. You need challenges in life. That is why people strive to achieve ambitious goals and why you hear some of the most successful folks in the world say that their happiest days were when they were poor and struggling to survive, not now that they're filthy rich and everything is taken care of.

So find some new things that motivate you. Something that challenges and excites you. There is nothing to gain from having security: a nice job with a nice income, a nice family, a nice house, etc., etc. All of those things are ""nice"" to have but they're not what will make you happy. You can only find meaning in other things. Things that you do, not that you have.

And it probably is the middle life crisis that many men used to go through in the past. These things just tend to happen earlier nowadays, in part because it's easier to wake up and realize how meaningless it all is. Doing what everyone else does I mean, trying to fit in and impress others, trying to live up to the expectations of society. So if you've reached that point now then it's time that you start looking for things that can provide you with the fulfillment you need. More money probably won't do that though, same as any achievements. Find something where you enjoy the doing more than any benefits you might get out of it in the long term.

And of course there is no clear path for this. Obviously doing what you were supposed to do didn't make you happy, so now you have to leave that path behind. Accept that there won't be any easy answers and no clear path forward. But if you don't embark on it then you'll never be able to find what you're looking for. And in the worst case you might wake up one day and ask yourself what you've been doing with your life and what it was all for."

2. Where did you get the idea that eggs even contain lots of fat? According to Google an egg contains 11% fat and 13% protein, so it's lower in both of those than 80/20 ground beef as an example.

So if you don't like eggs then don't eat them. I've developed an intolerance so I can't eat them anymore, although I sure would like to. But I'm still fine without them. Just focus on fatty meat and you'll be fine. Chicken is very lean, only the thighs have a decent amount of fat on them. And in general if you're eating leaner meat you can eat some butter or other fat source with your meals to get more fat in."
NoFap,ff8r1zz,t1_ff8qdoo,1579692601.0,"Yeah, the issue lies in people turning ""enlightenment"" into some special thing that will completely change who you are and everything will be different. When in reality it's like the quote you've used in this thread's title. Internally for you everything might change, how you see the world and everything in it, how you see yourself and your role in the universe, etc. But externally everything will still be the same. But if you turn it into something special that ""probably requires a lot of time and dedication to achieve it"". Or generally start seeing it as something to achieve, then that mindset will only move you further away from it. Because it's really about stripping away everything unnecessary. All the things that keep you from seeing the truth. Rather than adding more and more things to your life. And that's why I mentioned that all religions, even Buddhism, have all these traditions and rituals that might have served a purpose at some point. But as most followers didn't understand it they began to think that performing those rituals and following the rules is what it's really about. So it's all very misleading.

And as Eckhart mentioned in his book, Buddha used to practice ascetism as well for a time, punishing his body in hopes of achieving enlightenment that way. But he only became enlightened after he gave up that practice. The more you strip away all the things that you associate with enlightenment, the closer you'll get to it."

But if you eat those meat replacement burgers, then supposedly just 4 of those per day would be enough to give you man boobs. Soy really does have a lot of estrogen in it but it doesn't seem to get passed on into meat and animal products in any noteworthy amounts."
carnivore,ff8kj50,t3_erzst7,1579682875.0,"Why is there such a distinction between ""red"" and ""white"" meat anyway? White meat is pretty much always much leaner than red meat, and I assume that's also why it's more white than beef or pork. And the fat content is what it's all about. Same as on keto, you'll get optimal results from eating lots of fat. And you'll have a hard time doing that if you mainly eat chicken or for example tuna, which seems to always be pretty much pure protein. So fat content is what it's about and larger animals like cows and pigs tend to have much more of it, while birds need to be lean. If you wanna eat chicken, the thighs can have a decent amount of fat but most of the bird is extremely lean. Same thing with organ meats btw, so you should try to eat them with a normal fatty meat rather than have them be the main dish.

Some people say they're doing fine on a higher protein ratio though, but most report feeling better and having more energy on a higher fat ratio. 80% of total calories from fat is considered the ideal on keto. And if you look into that diet and how it works you'll understand why fat content is so important. This is sadly something that is still being ignored or downplayed way too much by folks on the carnivore diet."
NoFap,ff8jjkv,t1_ff8i5wv,1579681451.0,"Yeah, being fully present in the moment is what it's all about and that's what Eckhart also focusses on in his books. He does explain some of the teachings from all kinds of religions, mainly to show what they really mean and that they're all talking about the same thing. And what it's really about is entering a state of mindlessness where you are free from the mind. That is what happens when you become fully present and why for example extreme situations where your life is on the line can bring this out naturally. And why some people keep chasing such experiences. But once you have fully experienced it consciously you should be able to become fully present at all times. And then anything you do can become a meditative practice.

And yeah, he also explains that Buddha, Jesus and any other people that have lived throughout history and were glorified as more than a mere human were just enlightended people. People who had become free of the ego. But even most of their followers couldn't understand them, so they started glorifying them as humans tend to do. And then time passed and stories got passed on and embellished, misinterpreted and mistranslated and that's what's led to the religions we see today who have pretty much no idea about why they were originally created. Even Buddhism is full of rituals and traditions that might have served a purpose at some point but now they've probably become the main thing instead, while as Eckhart says himself in his book most Buddhists don't seem to believe that they can become like the Buddha themselves. Or not in this life. So they are also seeking happiness or salvation in some distant future, same as most other people. When the only place where it can be found is the now."

Since now you've got all those rules about who you are so you gotta follow them, right? Who would you be if you didn't?

As for what you want from life, that's just something you'll have to figure out. Try out different things, read some books that make you think and generally try to figure it out. What you value highly and what's important to you and what isn't will also change over the course of your life. So like I said don't get attached to some identity that you've created for yourself. You can be anything you want and change any aspect of your life at any time, and you'd still be the same. Because none of those things really matter and don't have anything to do with who you really are.

NoFap,ff6osj2,t1_ff64kxr,1579631744.0,"So are you still treating meditation as a habit instead of doing it as a conscious practice? Since you said that you don't always feel calm afterwards, when it should be about how you're feeling during. Ultimately meditation is just practice under ideal circumstances, so you can practice being present and at peace at any time during the day as well.

Have you read Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now? It's a really good book that explains what presence really is and what's at the heart of any spritual teachings out there, and it does so in very simple terms. No mysticism and nothing to believe in. Check it out if you haven't yet.

I'm mainly mentioning it because I had already learned a bit about presence and thought I knew what it is, and I had been meditating daily for some time when I read the book. But only when I read it was I able to experience it for the first time, and that showed me that I really had no idea of what it really was. Just a concept of it in my head. And once you've experienced it you can become present at any time, which makes meditation much more useful but it also means that you can work on being more present at any time, not just when meditating."
NoFap,ff6nw5w,t1_ff61gvy,1579631202.0,"What more should there be? You just stop thinking about it. That's all there is to it. But instead of trying not to think of it focus on something else. That's the easiest way. Then you just need to pay attention to notice when your thoughts wonder to the past again, and then you pull your focus back to the present moment or to something else.

The reason why this works is because our brain is only capable of focussing on one thing at a time. If you wanna do multiple things at once then you'll be jumping back and forth between them. So find some activites that really require your full attention. Although you can't just run from it, you have to learn to deal with those thoughts actively as well. So like I said, pay attention to what's going through your head. And if a thought comes up that doesn't serve you then just leave it and focus on something else. Or turn a negative thought into a positive one.

Changing your circumstances is something you need to do as well. But you can't do that if you're still stuck in the past. So decide to move on first. Changing your thought patterns is just a matter of becoming aware of them and then changing them when necessary. If you do it consistently for a time you change the pattern so then you won't have to focus anymore on doing it all the time. But you should still try to maintain some awareness of anything that is going on in your head and body."
selfimprovement,ff5wgph,t3_ern05g,1579612557.0,"Well, for one they say that the things you find most annoying in others also tend to be the qualities that you have yourself. Whether that's always 100% I still can't say, although at least partially it definitely is.

As for why superficial things like that still annoy me? Because they're superficial mainly. Because I can see that it leads people on the wrong path and only causes problems for them. And because I really don't like being around superficial people. But I also remind myself wheneer I become aware of it that people do what they because they usually don't know any better. So even if you point out to someone that they're doing something wrong and they get offended, they're just reacting in the only way they can. There's literally no way for them to behave differently unless they become conscious enough to recognize their own behavior. And most people just aren't conscious enough to do that in most situations.

So ultimately whatever it is that annoys you about other people, it is always more about you than about them. There's pretty much nothing you can't get annoyed over if you really want to after all. And one thing that kinda annoys me as well is when people say: just let others do what they want, everyone's different and some people just enjoy doing dumb things. If you can see that someone is clearly causing harm to themselves in any way, can you really justify that as such ""being different and enjoying different things""? But again, if you get annoyed over such things then it's all about. Remind yourself that most people have zero control over their behaviors and thought patterns. They're just acting out their programming, same as a robot. So why would you blame them for doing what they've learned to do when they can't see any other way?"

Look up a guide for mindfulness meditation and start doing it daily. Learn to observe your thoughts and if you recognize that you're turning something into a huge problem for no reason, just stop doing it. Awareness of your thoughts is all you need but that is something that you need to work on. You can't fix it overnight. But you have the choice of either creating more problems for yourself or to work against that and so be more at peace. You just have to decide which seems preferable to you.

And what it comes down to ultimately is to stop worrying and overthinking everything and to start living more in the moment. Going to classes is as simple as it gets: you just go there and sit around for as long as the lesson lasts, hopefully paying attention and maybe making some notes. What is there to stress over? But of course it can seem stressful if you start thinking about all that stuff that is not directly related to it. So stop doing that and just focus on what you need to do right, in this moment. That way there are no problems and any issues that might come up in the future you'll deal with when the time comes."
ketoscience,ff5pw0b,t1_ff5ovue,1579605310.0,"You just keep going back to what we've already said: you have certain believes and you like to stick to those. You have no confirmation for your believes but you like them more than the idea that you might be just as fine without vegetables. And the idea that a meat based diet is ""extreme"" is also just a thought in your head. There is nothing extreme about it unless you convince yourself otherwise. Or let society and the media do it for you, as you have since veganism seems less extreme to you for that reason. Cause there's a huge industry behind it pushing this diet and paying off the media and health experts and institutions to promote it.

There really is nothing more to say here. You're free to believe anything you want to believe. The main thing I was trying to get across aside form the information I've shared is that you should question your own believes. But most people aren't willing to do that and that's how it is. If you want to keep believing in something then nobody can stop you ultimately. But I'd encourage you to try to look at things a bit more objectively and to maybe think about what you need those believes for anyway. Are they helping you out in any way? Reality is the way it is and your believes and whether you like something or not don't affect it in any way."
NoFap,ff5o7ip,t1_ff5dbon,1579602865.0,"Yeah. That's the issue I see with many guys today who ""get into meditation"" because of all the benefits they hear about. Only that they learn to meditate by relying on guided meditations and apps, so at best they're probably getting some of the benefits that come from sitting in silence and being calm, the effects that meditation can have on the brain, etc. But otherwise this would probably not do much to help them become more conscious, and they probably won't be able to get much use out of what they've learned from meditation in every day life since they've become reliant on some app for it. So in a way the industry has managed to even turn meditation now into something that people do just to get some benefit and where they focus on some distraction, same as they're already doing in their daily life."
carnivore,ff5nz0s,t1_ff5mlyd,1579602510.0,"Buy a salt that contains both sodium and potassium. Going back to eating vegetables just for that seems like a very inefficient way to me. Electrolytes should never be an issue on keto or carnivore. They usually only are for people who are not aware that they should supplement them at times.

But how low is your weight currently and how much are you looking to gain? Are you really thin or just slim and would like to gain some excess body fat? Cause so far I've heard from women on this diet that they've often gained some weight in the right places, even gotten bigger boobs. If you lose lots of weight then it's usually because you're not eating enough. So maybe make sure that you're really eating as much as you should. And if you wanna gain weight you should eat more than you need for maintenance. I always recommend checking calorie calculators just as a baseline, for the minimum amount of calories you should be consuming. Since excess calories should generally not be an issue on this diet but it's easy to undereat just out of habit.

But how much fat were you actually consuming? It's not quite clear from your post but I hope dairy wasn't your only fat source while otherwise you were eating mostly lean meat. Although I don't see how adding one avocado could really make any difference either. Focus on fat content if you want to gain weight and feel better. There's still way too many people on this diet ignoring the importance of fat, or even saying stuff like ""being in ketosis is not important on this diet"". Only to then have another guy post about how he's not feeling that great and as it turns out he was eating too much lean meat."

Enter your data in a calorie calculator online to get an idea for how much you should be consuming pe day, then figure out how much you've actually been eating. That can be pretty insightful as eating to satiety can easily lead to undereating while you might think that you're eating more than enough."

And as for gluten, from what I've heard the gluten content in wheat used to be at around 5%. Now it's more like 50% because companies have raised it that way, since it helps fend off insects and increases their profits. It's also a glue so it helps with giving baked goods their shape. But it's also not quite healthy for us and yeah, it's not surprising that more and more people become aware that they're gluten intolerant. It's not even about an intolerance anymore but that there's just so much of it in our food that it will affect everyone to some degree. Some are just more affected than others, as with everything.

So if you want to actually get as many calories as you can while reducing food volume, then go for fatty meat. It's also what gives meat its taste. No idea how people can eat stuff like chicken breasts. I still don't get why you seem to be able to eat meat only once per day but I guess that's just how it is."
ketoscience,ff41rao,t1_ff40dmp,1579553657.0,"Yes, we've established that. Not everyone gets issues from vegetables. For some people they cause major issues but for others none at all. My main point the whole time was: if there's no benefits to eating them, why go back to doing it? When you haven't noticed any benefits, but also no side effects from cutting them out. But I've already said everything there is to say on that. You don't get any nutritional deficiencies from eating only meat and animal products. They do contain all the nutrients we need in sufficient or ideal amounts. If you can afford grass fed beef then go for that and eat some liver for optimal nutrition. Otherwise there is nothing in vegetables that is really beneficial on a zero carb diet. Your body needs less vitamin C if you avoid carb foods and you avoid all the toxins and anti nutrients found in most plant foods. Also most or all nutrients found in plant foods have a lower bio availaibility than in meat, so you're not quite getting as much out of them as you might think.

But as for fiber, it can cause issues long term. Even if it might not do that now, same as not everyone is obese and highly insulin resistant on a carb based diet right now. But most people nowadays end up that way, at the very least gaining some weight. So what do you stand to gain from continuing to eat vegetables? Whatever benefits some studies claim they should have? Maybe they should do a study comparing the side effects of those vegetables to their benefits. That would provide a clearer picture, but who knows if we'll ever get to see such a study. I won't hold my breath. Most research is funded by companies anyway and that's why you keep hearing about all the benefits of whole grains, plant foods and vegetables, etc. all the time. That's why I don't care too much about nutritional science. But decide for yourself.

Though as I think I've recommend already, if you really wanted to get proof, then get yourself tested while eating vegetables, then do it again after having only eaten fatty meat and animal products for a few months. That will provide you with the data you're looking for. And it will be a lot more useful to you than some epidemiological study measuring meat intake, vegetables consumption or whatever else on a high carb diet."

It doesn't really matter ultimately how many meals you eat, what matters is how many calories you're getting in total. If you can't get all the calories you need in one meal, then you gotta eat 2 or more. I currently eat about 800g of 80/20 ground beef and 100g of butter per day, spread over 2 meals. Which is a big caloric surplus for me but it's also easy to do. And ground beef is pretty cheap, but if it's too expensive for you or in your place then eat ground pork. Doesn't get cheaper than that, aside from chicken maybe but that's very lean.

Why would you want to chew with your mouth open? I've seen some guys here talk about how chewing with yout mouth open is supposed to be better in some way but I don't get it. Do they open their mouth as wide as possible while chewing? Is that somehow supposed to be beneficial? One guy even said that it's not even noticeable to others the way he does it, which begs the question why he's even doing it. But maybe you have any info on why to chew with your mouth open. I can certainly open my mouth wide enough while actually keeping my lips sealed, so it's not like it's holding me back or anything.

And maybe look into buddhist monks and how happy and emotional those guys are. They are all very happy and like to joke around, even though they have way more control over their emotions than most people in the modern world, or anywhere in the world really. And they are quite emphatic as well. If you don't feel like you need others right now then that might just be a phase. Although not ""needing"" others is a good thing. There's nothing good about being dependant on others for happiness as it keeps you from being happy by yourself.

carnivore,ff3z701,t3_erh531,1579552063.0,"I don't know why people seem to always withhold this information but what is your fat intake? You said you come from keto, so you should know that fat should be your main calorie source. This is no different on this diet. So how much fat are you eating and what percentage of your total calories does it make up? Also how many calories are you consuming in total?

Based on your post I might as well guess that you've switched from eating a high fat diet to a high protein, low fat one, eating mostly lean meat and even foregoing the butter you drank with your coffee. Yes, that can make you starve, no matter how much you eat. Focus on fat content.

And OMAD was easy for me on keto because I could easily get about half of my calories from peanuts. When I switched to carnivore I couldn't do that anymore as now I'd have to eat 1kg of ground beef in one sitting, which isn't very enjoyable. So now I eat two meals. Unless you can eat a huge amount of fatty meat easily in one sitting then you might be eating too little now. And if you wanna stick to OMAD the you might have to add more fat in other ways. But we can only guess because you've provided no info on how much you're eating exactly. ""Plenty"" is not very specific and satiety is mainly about what you're used to eating. Get used to eating more for a while and it might become your new normal. Which might be a good sign that you were undereating before.

orthotropics,ff3y354,t1_ff3syfg,1579551368.0,Are you talking about one meal per day in total or just one meal where you eat meat? For health reasons all your meals should be meat based and for training your jaw chewing gum should be more than enough. I use a large piece made up of 5 normal Falim pieces and chew that for an hour or so per day. I didn't get huge jaw muscles from that though so if you wanna get more impressive results you might have to look into some of those jaw exercisers. Although you should be careful as they might cause more harm than good. Especially one I saw where you only bite on it with your front teeth.

I used to struggle a lot more even with lower weights on squats when I was doing 3x5 reps than when I was benching and rowing at my limit and still increasing the weights. I was actually still enjoying those exercises, especially from the third set on. While on squats all 3 sets were nothing but a struggle. Anything less than 5x5 just seems like too little volume to me and warm up sets can't make up for that.

So check out an advanced program. The official site used to recommend Madcow and Advanced 5x5 I think. Or try reducing the reps and see how it works for you."

If you really had only 1 hour after coming form work until you go to bed, then sure, not much you can do in that case.

Stronglifts5x5,ff3mwp9,t3_ergkqi,1579544467.0,"You seem to think that this is a bodybuilding routine. It's not and the goal here is not to get as big as you can be. And as such there's also no need to only train each body part once per week or other things that are common on bodybuilding programs. So no, your muscles won't develop unproportionally. Instead you'll actually avoid asymmetries because you won't be training on machines that are much more likely to cause it.

But squats are a full body exercise. Ever heard of folks telling you to work out your legs if you wanna get big. Why? Because that's where your largest muscles are and training them releases more growth hormone than training all the smaller muscles in your upper body. And that's probably why there's such a big focus on them. They require you to lift huge weights and to utilize pretty much all muscles in your body to do it. Not just your legs. Squats and deadlifts are the kings of all exercise for that reason.

But is doing it thrice per week excesssive once you've already reached your limits? Maybe. In my view this program's recommendation to just keep squatting heavy on each workout is not that great. And reducing the number of sets and reps has always led me to stall out completely due to too little volume. So for recovery you might try something like lifting lighter once per week. Until you reach the point where recovery becomes a problem though this is not an issue."
selfimprovement,ff3m27a,t3_erfxlt,1579543938.0,"You gotta decide your priorities. If your job allows you no time to cook proper meals, then that's your problem.

Like do you really just come home, eat some junk food cause you have no time to cook and then go to bed to repeat the same thing the next day? Or do you spend some time watching tv or doing whatever, which you could actually use to cook a proper meal instead? Quite often things like ""I just don't have the time for it"" are nothing but excuses, so look a bit more into it to see if that's really the truth.

But if you want a simple way, buy fatty meat and eat that. That's it. You can even do that at fast food stores. Just order meat without the buns and everything else. It's the healthiest food you can eat and you won't have to bother with vegetables. So it's ideal for someone who has little time or is just lazy. I sure don't enjoy cooking elaborate meals with dozens of ingredients, even if I have the time for it. Just avoid any carbs or pretty much anything that isn't meat or an animal product and you'll be fine. You'll be healthy and should lose any excess weight over time.

Anyways, look into the ketogenic diet and the carnivore diet if you wanna learn more about those. But no matter what you choose to go with, you'll still have to at least do the minimum to stick to the plan. If you end up at McD's cause you're too lazy to cook, then you'll probably also not care about what you're eating at times, and so will sabotage yourself constantly. Some effort is always required if you wanna do things properly and get actual results from it."
carnivore,ff3iq1k,t3_erg3sr,1579541896.0,"Read up on how the ketogenic diet works. It's pretty well researched and aside from the stuff about not eating any plant foods at all this diet is the exact same thing. If you cut out all carbs you eliminate any foods that can spike your insulin, and without that your body doesn't store fat. Or at least not to any significant amount. Some people seem to still be able to gain a bit of weight when they eat a lot, even eating only meat. While others like me can eat a huge surplus while being quite sedentary and still not really gain any weight at all.

And you're even consuming quite a large amount of carbs. On keto the upper limit is usually 50g of carbs to avoid dropping out of ketosis. But if you're not gaining weight then it's probably still fine. You could try to up your fat intake though as it's your main calorie source on this diet."
NoFap,ff3hu3w,t1_ff2sebt,1579541352.0,"So what exactly are you looking at to determine what's right? What people have been doing for hundreds or thousands of years? Or how we have evolved to live? Because we are as far removed from our natural lifestyle today as we can get. Our modern diet has been around since we've discovered agriculture. At no point before were we getting most of your calories from plant foods, if any at all. Weston Price's reports show that native tribes living on a meat based diet were the healthiest while the closer any people are to our modern diet, the more the have all the common health issues that have always plagued modern civilizations. So much for what's ""natural for us"" and how much importance you should be putting on what people have been doing for hundreds or thousands of years.

But to get back to masturbation: are you sure that humans who were living in nature and who had shit going on in their lives spent their time jerking off? Is there any evidence for that? Some cave paintings of humans having sex? Masturbation, same as any other pleasure seeking behaviors like addictions to food and videogames, social media, whatever. All of it is a symptom of our modern lifestyle, of modern civilizations. Because it has made us too comfortable and has robbed our lives of any meaning. And even a hundred years ago there were highly successful people who didn't waste their time jerking off. They built empires instead. And those people stilll exist today, they're just a lot more rare due to how widespread and normal porn and masturbation has become. And because we're being blasted with sex everywhere.

So tell me: why would someone who has better things going on in his life and who can even have sex with women waste his time and energy on jerking off? Does that really seem like such a natural thing to you? As natural as watching tv for hours and killing yourself slowly with junk food? Don't kid yourself. You are not being ""sexually active"" when you're jerking off. You're being the exact opposite: a sexless male who can only fuck his hand. And this is also what kills your drive to actually get with women. So again tell me: what possible benefit do you get from masturbation?

There is no problem with not having sex. Monks do it their whole lives and they're fine. And actually much happier than most people in the modern world who indulge in pleasures 24/7. But the thought that jerking off to women on a screen would somehow be superior to not having sex and not getting any sexual release at all is quite sad. But it shows pretty well the mindset that is predominant in our society today. Where people are always trying to make up for what they lack in some other way. Feeling lonely? Jerk off to porn. Feeling worthless? Make lots of money and show it off. Feel like your life is meaningless? Just consume a bunch of stuff or even drugs to make yourself feel good and forget all about it. And that's what masturbation is as well. There is nothing natural about it, nor any benefit to it whatsoever. The only benefits some guys see in it is that it allows them to escape those feelings of horniness that they've never learned to deal with. So it allows them to remain weak.

Only when I sweat a lot and lose plenty of electrolytes that way do I need to supplement. As I would have on a standar diet as well. I still remember very well how low on them I used to be after playing tennis in the summer heat back on a standard diet. Of course I had no idea about electrolytes back then so I couldn't supplement them either.

But this is really weird. You keep talking about the importance of scientific research, but then go on to say that your n=1 experiement showed no benefits from eliminating fiber? The participants of that study that showed that fiber is the cause of most digestive issues all had digestive issues before they took part. And cutting out the fiber solved it for them. If you don't have any problems yet then why should anything change? Like I said, I didn't really get any benefits from eliminating vegetables either. I never had problems with constipation in my life. But I was also eating only few vegetables most of my life. From what I hear though vegans do tend to get serious issues with it over time due to their very large fiber intake. So there you can see what effect fiber can have. That it's less extreme for you now doesn't mean that it won't affect you more over time, or if you start eating more fiber.

Your comment really doesn't make much sense to be honest. You should read it yourself to see why. You've even stated that you're ""not convinced"" that not eating any vegetables at all is ideal, yet have not given any reason whatsoever for it. So what reason do you have to not think that it is ideal? Since I've seen no studies showing that this is the case either. In the end science is nice but I'm capable of doing my own experiments and seeing what works for me and what doesn't. And for many others as well. And I put more value on that than on shoddy science that is funded by the industry, which sadly applies to most nutritional research today.

NoFap,ff2xt6o,t3_erav29,1579528045.0,"I've had a similar experience on my recent streaks that went for up to 90+ days. In the past I used to chat with girls online on sites like Omegle, and so whenever I'd get strong urges to be with girls I'd end up on those sites again. And that would make me horny, since all I did was chat with them with no other way of interaction, and it would lead me to keep obsessing over girls. While on my recent streaks I just stopped focussing on girls completely and only focussed on other things and that way was able to achieve really long streak with ease, and girls and sex just really stopped mattering to me.

And at this point I can really see that they really don't matter. They're just another part of life, like everything else. And nothing really matters anyway in the way that you can be fine without anything. It's only your mind that turns things into a huge deal. Your mind is what convinces you that you need to eat tasty food regularly and watch porn and jerk off to it and chase girls and whatever else. And if you believe it then it will seem like something you couldn't possibly live without. But it's all just in your head and if you spend enough time away from something you'll realize this. Which seems to be what's happening to you now on your current streak.

This frees you to see things clearly and decide for yourself what really matters in life, so it's definitely nice to have reached that point. And it allows you to be at peace no matter what happens. While others are still making themselves feel miserable just because they have no gf, seeking fulfillment in external things where it can never be found."
selfimprovement,ff2x6ww,t3_er7ebs,1579527463.0,"Well, what's the only time that matters? The past? The future? Do those really matter?

What is the part? A memory in your head. Nothing more. What is the future? A thought or expectation that you have. Again it only exists in your head and there's nothing real about it. And even if you're thinking about an event that is most likely to occur, like the job interview you'll have tomorrow at 10am. What's the point of thinking about it now? It'll happen when the time comes. Right not it's just a thought in your head.

So what you need to do is to get out of your head and into the present moment. That is where life is happening, always. It can be no other way because this moment is all there ever is. Anything that has ever happened has happened in this moment and anything that will happen will do so in the now. So why worry about past and future when the now is all you ever have? The only time where you can live your life and take action?

So if you have some event coming up, then prepare for it and figure out how to go about it the best way possible. But once you've done that return to the present moment until the time for it comes.

Look up a guide for mindfulness meditation and start doing it daily, and also read Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now. It will explain everything I've just said in much more detail. But try to feel the truth that's contained within the pages because your mind can't understand it. Either way though, if you keep practicing meditation daily and keep working on being more present you will get there eventually. Ultimately your issue is mainly an inability to focus and the simple answer to your question is: you stay focussed by learning to focus. By recognizing when your mind is wandering and then pulling it back to the present moment or the thing you want to focus on. You gotta develop that ability and the more you use it the easier it gets."
NoFap,ff2wot7,t3_er62u7,1579526972.0,If you're talking about any kind of research then you should post a link to it so everyone knows what you're talking about and can read up on it for themselves.
carnivore,ff2wh9g,t3_er3xt1,1579526763.0,"Buy a salt that is made of equal parts sodium and potassium and salt your food with it. If you're just looking to get started, then I'd even put some in the water you're drinking because you lose a lot of electrolytes during the first 2 days when you enter ketosis.

Overall you might only need to use salt at all during the first few weeks though. After that if you're not sweating much or at all you might never need it, same as on a standard diet really. Thinking back to the times when I used to play tennis in the summer heat, I was seriusly depleted of electrolytes afterwards. But of course I had no idea about it back then. Keto sites like to act as if you had to always supplement them on keto but the way I see it it's not much different from a standard diet, beyond the initial adaptation period. Just that you're no longer eating all those processed foods full of salt."
orthotropics,ff2w4cm,t3_er7gys,1579526401.0,"Mewing is a natural thing. It's about having natural tongue posture, which then helps your face develop properly the way it should. It's not a manly thing so it shouldn't give you a manlier face if you aren't a man. But take a look at some images of women with recessed chins. Their chin might look very small but does that make them more attractive? Angelina Jolie used to have a very attractive facial structure with a well developed jaw line. Looking at her pics now though she doesn't look as healthy as she used to in the past."
NoFap,ff2vrkb,t3_er5e5o,1579526031.0,"You need to find better friends. Don't waste your time on people who spread negativity in any form. And don't waste your time thinking about how to explain your actions to others. Just do it. That's all that matters. If you know why you're doing something and you have good reasons for it, then what does it matter what anyone else thinks? In general ignore any doubters and negative people and only mention things like this when they come up in a conversation, and only towards people who you know are more open minded.

You don't need to justify your actions to anyone as long as they only affect you. You only need to justify them to yourself. Otherwise focus on the doing."
selfimprovement,ff2vct5,t3_erc9wk,1579525604.0,"If it's relevant enough for you you'll remember it. If you just read books for entertainment or don't plan to make use of what you're learned, etc.  then you'd probably forget about it all quickly. Similar to how I used to forget a lot of the useless crap I had to learn in school shortly after writing the exam, while any stuff that seemed actually relevant to me I was able to remember easily. Your brain's just very efficient, so it doesn't waste space on crap you don't think you really need.

But beyond that, how do you read your books? As fast as you can, just trying to get through them so you can get to the next one? Or do you take your time, read maybe a chapter per day and think about what you've learned, maybe even try to put it to use right away? The latter will make things stick while the former is probably more of a distraction, so why would you remember everything from it? Same as you won't remember everything from some random tv show you've watched a few weeks ago out of boredom.

But as for me personally, I do remember large parts of any books I've read. In big part because pretty much all of those were really good and really insightful books and because I enjoy learning new things and widening my horizon. So focus on the quality of the material as well. If you read any random book then you might get little out of it and as such are less likely to remember anything. But the best ones are chock full with really useful knowledge that you definitely want to remember, if you have any actual interest in the topic."
carnivore,ff2v2p0,t3_er4130,1579525304.0,"Fat is the most important part. It's where many vitamins are stored anyway. Not sure what difference there really is in pure protein between grass and grain fed. Maybe someone can enlighten me.

But couldn't you make a deal with any local farmers who visit the weekly markets so they keep some meat for you to pick up later that day? Or even deliver it to your door since they're already in town."
orthotropics,ff2unwx,t1_ff1qo7w,1579524853.0,"They do and I have heard of people specificially noticing that their face for slimmer after they switched to a ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet, both or very low or zero carb diets. Part of that has to do with the fact that your body stores some water together with glycogen in the muscles, so when you cut out all carbs and enter ketosis you lose around 2kg of water weight.

But another thing that comes into play is inflammation. And this is part of why some people have puffy faces. That's probably the main reason why those people I mentionved have reported such noticeable changes in their face. Because inflammation causes your body to store water as well because it helps deal with it. And if you eliminate all carb foods, then you also get rid of all the things that were causing any inflammation. So your body will get rid of any such water it had stored as well as the inflammation gets reduced over time."
ketoscience,ff2uf5z,t1_ff2shxd,1579524579.0,"I'm not gonna argue with you in terms of ""let's trade scientific evidence"" since at the end of the day it's not as relevant anyway. At least not to the degree that many folks obsess over it. ""Oh, so there is clear evidence that something is bad for you if you eat it right now? Well, I can't believe that unless I get to see a study that clearly shows the same effects observed over many decades"". If you're reliant on that kind of proof for anything, then you'll be waiting your whole life for it. Proof like that hardly exists anywhere in the world of nutrition anyway. The main proof we have is that our standard diet isn't working at all, and the cause of it are mainly carbs.

But you're free to believe what you want. If you want to believe that there's anything beneficial in plants then do that. You've just pointed out how you found no benefits in cutting out all plant foods, but have mentioned zero benefits that you would get from not doing that. One thing you could have mentioned would be anti oxidants. Yeah, really important on a meat based diet. Folks on a plant based diet probably have a use for them as their food is already full of toxins and anti nutrients.

And your argument on that is like saying that a standard diet is harmless, simply because there's people who aren't sick yet. Of course over time that is likely to change, as we already see barely anyone nowadays who still remains perfectly slim and healthy as they get old. But some folks always need studies to point out the obvious to them. So keep waiting. Either until you get your studies some day, or until you start to experience the effects for yourself. I prefer to rely more on common sense and experience, from myself and others, nowadays. Science doesn't know everything. We all know that. And it is working very slowly, in big part because it is more concerned with upholding the status quo than with conducting ground breaking research and questioning our current believes.

Cutting out vegetables made no difference for you and eating them made no difference for me. So where does that put us? I'm fine with not eating stuff I have no use for while you'd rather rely on some perceived benefits that studies like to claim. While at the same time ignoring any potential negative effects because ""we don't have long term studies on that yet"". But maybe your main reason is just that you like to eat them for enjoyment. I would wager that this definitely plays a large part in it, as it does for most people who just can't give up their carbs and vegetables."
