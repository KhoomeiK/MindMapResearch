buffalobills,fe4iyck,t3_enr9se,1578859848.0,It’s an award for sportsmanship.... and they gave it to Edelman?  What planet is this?!

buffalobills,fdsnmtb,t3_emzgf4,1578705568.0,"TBH, I don’t really care what Geoff thinks.   My gut tells me he hasn’t watched more than 2 or 3 Bills games in the past 2 years.  Anybody could’ve watched the Houston game and made generalized blanket statements about Josh.  But, I’ve seen prime Josh.  I saw him in Minnesota last year, in Dallas and Pittsburgh this year. That wasn’t him in Houston. So many things went wrong in that game - some of it the organization’s fault, some out of their control - that Josh wasn’t able to get the momentum going that we needed to seal it up.  Josh ‘19 was leaps and bounds ahead of Josh ‘18, and Josh ‘20 is really going to shut some of these talking heads up."

buffalobills,fds1xum,t3_emsl43,1578693069.0,"At the Jets game last month, some jabroni wearing a TB jersey was talking shit to Reid.  Reid turns around and shows him a football and says ""You want this?,"" then looked the dude straight in the eyes and threw the ball to a kid a bout 20 feet to the dude's left - *maintaining eye contact with this asshole the whole time*.  It was a power move, the likes of which will reverberate through New Era Field for years to come.  I heard the TB superfan cried himself to sleep that night, but that's hearsay."

YouShouldKnow,fdln0r5,t1_fdjyx2x,1578527721.0,"The radar unit isn’t actually what your infraction is based on.  The officer is trained to estimate your speed visually, while the radar is used to confirm it.  During the radar operator course at the police  academy, cadets are usually taken out to a highway where they observe traffic for a set time.  They are  required to correctly estimate a certain number of vehicles’ speeds (+/- 3mph) before earning their certification."
