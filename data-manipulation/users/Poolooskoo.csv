AskReddit,fcxoq8k,t1_fcx5v9d,1578067932.0,"I knew this girl who wanted a scalp massage once at a party and my buddy said he'd help her in the bathroom, after about 3 minutes we heard screaming and banging so I said I'd check it out, as I walked in I saw my buddy with a firm basketball grasp on the sides of her head plunging her into the toilet and flushing it. Shit was so funny I put my foot on her back to keep her from getting away haha! Then after about a minute she got out but her makeup was ruined from the water, she ran out crying and didn't come back, buzzkill!"

AskReddit,fc9zad0,t3_egtrpp,1577560441.0,"So there I was, speeding down the freeway off 17th and 4th quarter from Las Vegas, Tom Petty's ""American Girl"" playing on the radio, LOUD. Top down convertible the sun was shining the cool breeze was blowing in my hair and I had my newly-wed fiancé sitting beside me, she leans over to me and screams something at me, I cant hear her because of Tom Petty screaming ""AND FOR ONE DESPERATE MOMENT THEERE"". I turn the radio down as Tom breaks down his verse and gets ready to lead into the chorus. ""WHAT"" I ask my newly-wed fiancé. She looks at me with intent and smiles devilishly, and starts to unbuckle my pants.

So naturally I start to speed up, I turn the radio back up too as I realised Tom was about to hit his last chorus just as I'm about to climax from oral stimuli, as he screams his last ""AMERICAN GIRL"" thats when it hit me, a speedbump."
