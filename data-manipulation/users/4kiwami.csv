You don't feel like the leaking of information about the condition of somebody's child would cross the line, especially if it's not public information? If that really was Robert's dad contacting you it sounds like it had a lot of traction, and the post affected somebody's personal life. You can blame FB and Twitter, but you have a huge audience here that you're responsible for.

Ever see that video of Method Man talking about how pissed off he was about Wendy Williams leaking his wife's cancer diagnosis, and how it affected people around him? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du1UViOs4Hk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du1UViOs4Hk) People treated them differently and made a difficult situation worse for them. 

There are damn near a million subs. Some of them are going to be friends of fighters. What if kids who go to school with Robert's kids find out and start treating them differently? That's a hell of a lot different than a few more MMA fans posting about Robert pulling out of fights.

I don't think you guys do a bad job by any stretch, so sorry if it seems like I'm taking a huge shit on you. I just don't agree with your rationale in this case, especially when you keep blaming the audience. You can't moderate a community of nearly 1 million and throw your hands up saying ""It's their fault for upvoting"". Controlling the basic nature of how people interact with media is the main purpose of moderation."

There was a comment chain very early on in that post which explicitly pointed out the dubious nature of the story. It was an amateur rag that cited a specific twitter account that was an amateur rag, that was citing some other ""news outlet"" that didn't have the story posted anywhere. Given the personal nature of the content it should have absolutely been removed.

At this rate I could go post any bullshit on Twitter, and as long as it gets picked up by somebody who sees my post on Twitter, then it will stay up. You had enough time to tag it with ""rumor"". If you need more manpower on the mod team, recruit! Sticky a post on the front page.

Jorge got that fight for shutting up Ben Askren who did constantly run his mouth (now retired), and Nate Diaz beat the breaks off of Pettis after a 3 year layoff.

I get why the idea of a rematch with Khabib doesn't make sense, but to call it the UFC turning into WWE is just wrong. It wasn't 2019 or 2020 that Brock Lesnar and CM Punk fought in the org. In fact 2019 was such a strong year with so many fighters coming into their own on their own volition like Jorge Masvidal, Amanda Nunes, Kamaru Usman, Israel Adesanya and so many more really blossoming. You're focusing on one guy who is (admittedly) the favorite child that will make the org massive bucks. Just look at the rest of the cards that are already scheduled for this year...it's going to be fantastic.
