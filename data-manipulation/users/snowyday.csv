BeAmazed,fek7xfe,t1_fejqdvo,1579194475.0,"Fact: the Redskins refuse to support doing this. You know the Hogettes — the guys who dress in dresses and pig noses? — they have a program to bring sick kids (and families) to tailgate and then watch the game. Then they bring them to the players’ exit tunnel. 

What do you think the Redskins contribute?  
Free parking space for the tailgate?  

Free or discounted tickets for the kids?  

Free or discounted food or souvenirs?  

Nope. None of the above. Hogettes pay for everything out of their pockets. 

Redskins only involvement: allow the kids and families into the tunnel and to sit on folding chairs.  Players can come over and say hi if they feel like it.

The day we went was the day I learned London Fletcher is the classiest man in the league and the only decent human in the 2009 Redskins organization.

>	The “Arrested Development” pilot would serve as a calling card for the duo, landing them a gig shooting “Community,” another indie-darling TV comedy.

>That’s about when Marvel came calling.

>“We just got a call one day from our agent, who said, ‘Marvel has a list of 10 directors that they want to talk to about the next Captain America movie, and you guys are on it,’” Anthony says.

>“We had recently done these paintball episodes for ‘Community,’ Kevin [Feige, president of Marvel Studios] loved them,” Joe adds. “He also looks for people who understand humor. It’s a combination. We were in the tonal zone for him with guys who have done a lot of comedy, and then all of a sudden he saw this paintball episode and went, ‘They also understand the action genre, maybe we should talk to them?’”

>Those conversations led to the well-received “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” which put the brothers in line not only to direct its sequel, “Captain America: Civil War” (set to premiere May 6), but the two-part film “The Avengers: Infinity War,” coming out in 2018."
