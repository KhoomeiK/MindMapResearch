I know space-wise it's not realistic, but I wish I could just go to the cubicle when I need to get shit done, and come back to the open space when work is lighter."
todayilearned,ffmtx0i,t1_fflranf,1580058846.0,"Yep. I am a little over half a year at my new job and am a pretty extreme introvert. I don't think my coworkers understand that even though I like them, it's exhausting having to interact with them for 8 hours at a time. And I don't know how to bring it up with my boss that I want to be a team player but need to be left alone to actually get work done.

todayilearned,ffmrwv1,t3_eu5wt2,1580058299.0,"As someone who works in one of these, I mostly agree. I love my team, we have fun, and it's nice being able to just turn your chair and discuss things. But, I can't help but feel I'd be 10x more productive and a lot less stressed if I didn't feel like anyone/everyone could be looking over my shoulder at any time, and if people were less willing to distract me while I'm trying to focus. The first part is a real issue for me. I have imposter syndrome. No matter how many people tell me I'm doing good work, I always feel like I'm not there yet. So having an open office where someone might watch me stumble my way through learning something is insanely stressful. I want to do the work in private and then show off the result for criticism and reworking afterwards. I cannot handle the idea of a more senior skilled individual watch me suck at something after the first couple months on the job, regardless of how chill they are about it. If there were an open-office solution that let me hide my monitors, that'd be ideal."

There are things I miss, but there are definitely things I don't. Like, these days you get on a shady site and you might get pop-ups and a virus, those days you'd get the same, but also a couple hundred dollar bill from a dial-up site that charged by the minute that you had no idea would happen because just like today the are you 18 warnings mean nothing.

AskReddit,ffmaqax,t3_eu0agw,1580051479.0,"I usually go with ""I tend to overthink things and will spend too long on a task if I think it can be done differently or better.

It's kind of a trap. I worked for MSPs where everything is a band-aid fix and the pace is break-neck, and grew to hate positions where speed was prioritized over accuracy. So once I got out of the MSP game, I used this flaw to kind of disqualify a job by seeing if it disqualifies me. If me being more methodical and wanting to actually solve problems at the cost of being the fastest to resolve something is actually seen as a deal-breaker, then I don't want to work for them anyway. If they get it, then it's win-win."

I hated Skyward Sword, and just found Twilight Princesses first 5-6 hours so dull I'll never beat it again, and figured the BotW hype would end up the same, super inflated because it's Zelda. I decided last minute to pick up a switch. Had nothing to do, money to burn, and the line for walk-in's had two slots left when I happened to drive by my local gamestop on launch day. Got my switch, and having nothing else to play, begrudgingly picked up BotW the next day.

Like 2 hours in I was thinking ""Holy shit, this is the new bar. I've never felt this immersed in a game world before in my life"". It made me decide trying to define a perfect 10 is dumb, because it's got flaws that keep it from a 10 (weapon system and lack of real dungeons being the big ones), but is still the best game I've ever played.

Fighters,femnobx,t3_epv4bl,1579263904.0,"Depends on what kind of experience you're looking for, honestly. 

If you want something ""classic"" as in 2D, sprite, 1v1, and not-anime: The go to answers are Street Fighter 3:Third Strike, and Garou Mark of the Wolves. They were both late in the sprite era, beautifully animated, well balanced enough that you don't have to feel you can't play any character (well, except Sean in SF3, it's pretty much agreed he's the biggest downgrade from his original version), and both can be played damn near arcade perfect online through FightCade. With Third Strike also being active on the PS3 still, and for offline play both are available on the Switch (3S technically can be played online, but the community isn't there and it's a wireless console mostly so even if it were I wouldn't bother).

If you want something more anime then Melty Blood is still active on discord. It's the original fighting game from the studo that went on to make UNIST.

My personal recommendations are:

1v1: Third Strike (I prefer parry to perfect guard mechanics)
2v2: Tatsunoko Vs Capcom. It's a Wii game that runs perfectly in Dolphin. Still has side tourneys.

Also, if you want some lesser recommended titles that are still great: Last Blade 2. Feels very different, kind of something between Classic SF and Samurai Shodown."

Like, I'd be stoked if we got one of the pegasus knights, or barbarians, or even just a thief, but nope, not your boring ass main character so nobody knows or cares about them. At least Corin and Robin are different, though just as bland"

Meditation,fe6b484,t3_enth8i,1578885928.0,"New to this sub, but I'm getting the feeling a lot of people (and I don't mean to single you out, it's every post I've seen here so far) seem to treat mediation as something very rigid and ritualistic. If you have an itch, scratch it, or if you want to use it as a focal point, then don't. You'll have two different experiences depending on what you do, but neither is lesser than the other."
Meditation,fe6ap9y,t3_enrl46,1578885624.0,"You can not let it go, and mediate instead on what is pulling your attention towards it. Switch from something like mindfulness meditation to concentration mediation, and try to focus on the emotional place those thoughts put you in. Maybe you'll find yourself more comfortable living with those anxieties, maybe you'll find that you can't actually grasp the root of the emotion and it'll kind of fall apart or loosen, then you can switch back. 

When I do 20 minutes of meditation, about 10 of those minutes is my mind worrying about the things I have to deal with in the future. But I still get a good mediation out of it. It's not quantitative, those other 10 minutes are worth what they provide. Treat meditation like a process and not an event. You don't mediate and suddenly are mindful, the process of mediation is like pulling the threads of your brain knots. So know it's not like you're wasting time by not being able to focus fully."
todayilearned,fdsjkgp,t1_fdsecst,1578703956.0,"That's kind of half-right. I mean, it is an Alan Watts quote, but it's not really a Buddhist perspective. There is merit to action, but not action without proper understanding of causality. And it can be understood, by a mindful and wise practitioner. Like, a buddhist wouldn't see a beggar asking for money and go ""I'd like to help, but who knows if I give that person money they won't spend it on drugs"", they'd go ""Instead of money, I should offer that person a meal, maybe direct them to shelter."" 

Sure, there's an individual enlightenment that allows one to step outside the flow of Karma (which is basically just causality, not some magic thing like westerners like to teach it), but that doesn't benefit anyone but you, and the end goal of Buddhism isn't just to get enlightened and fuck off to nirvana, it's to bring all of humanity with you."
todayilearned,fdsj02u,t1_fdsau2z,1578703672.0,"That's basically Theravada Buddhism. Mahayana says do good to cultivate enlightenment, as they're hand in hand. Theravada is more ""Get enlightened first, then do good, otherwise your good intention might not produce good results"". Mahayana is much more common these days (understandably since, well, you kind of have to go be a monk to properly practice Theravada).

Still, even in Mahayana, the first thing you learn about is the eightfold path, where they emphasize having a correct vision and wisdom is the first step, before right action. Even in more layman's texts like the Dalai Lama's writings, he compares the path to giving to a beggar. Yeah, giving a beggar money is nice and all that, but it's not good karma if that beggar immediately uses it to kill themselves with drugs. There are obviously better ways, like food or clothes or shelter."
todayilearned,fdsi998,t1_fdshncl,1578703256.0,"Yeah, while I agree these people did something dumb and may not have the best of intentions, I also think this person makes a poor argument.

I have something to gain by doing that, and wouldn't do it if I didn't feel I'd gain anything from it. For something to be selfish just because there's a desired end is kind of silly."

SuperBestFriends because it hurts to see a dead channel I used to love not get updated. I miss my 3 weird dads.

Game Grumps because they went full clickbait titles/thumbnails, and the more I watch of them the more I realize it's just business for Arin at this point. He never seems into it anymore. He seems to hate most of what they play, and every episode seems to devolve into him screaming at the video game while Dan tells personal stories or asks personal questions. I made peace with the channel not being game commentary anymore once Jon left and Danny clearly hadn't played video games since the 16bit era. But I stuck around for the entertainment. But now the channel just doesn't seem to have a heart anymore, and more feels like Arin trying to hold off the decline by chasing trends.

Jontron, for obvious reasons. One of those things where I wish I could separate the creator from the art but every time I see him I can't help but think of his sudden redpill behavior. 

Yogscast, well, there were basically 4 people keeping me on that channel. Lewis, Simon, Sips, and Sjin. Simon barely appeared anymore, Sips left of his own volition and rebranded his own channel, and then the whole Caff/Turps being creeps, internal audit, and Sjin leaving after some old accusations against him were dug up. Basically the majority of the OG crew not being in content made me realize I just didn't care. Sjin and Simon hit the worst though.
