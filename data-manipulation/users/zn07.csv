depression,fcwox1m,t3_ejb9ce,1578032064.0,Waking up for school and picking out an outfit is so painful because I don’t really have any pants that will hide my stomach fat. My shirts are short sleeved but when I raise my hand my armpit hair will show. I usually end up wearing the same hoodie every single week and my friends and other people probably notice i wear the same thing every week which makes me insecure too.
