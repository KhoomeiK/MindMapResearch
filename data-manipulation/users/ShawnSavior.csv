AskGayMen,fff0ymf,t3_et5co5,1579872662.0,"Ehh...I used to. Until I realized that it wasn’t a requirement to live that sort of lifestyle. The gay community is not localized to just one group of people, though I get what you mean. I just kinda live my life as a gay man without delving into the lifestyle of one."
GayRateMe,ffc83m0,t1_ffc7hit,1579793703.0,"Wow, I’m usually pretty lenient on ratings, but that’s kinda crazy. I tend to get stares from other girls and I don’t think a 4 warrants those looks. 

Unless your standards are crazy high or that was a bad photo"

BigBrother,ff9869x,t3_epvar4,1579707078.0,Is nobody going to mention how Ian utilized this strategy to underplay himself? He took on so many punishments that people wanted to keep him because of it.
AskGayMen,ff69sym,t1_ff67c88,1579622470.0,"I’ve been on there for about a year and haven’t gotten a single date. My bio is good, and my pictures are good. Though I get no swipes. Of course there are people who like me but I can’t see them unless I pay for Tinder Gold and that is not happening. Also, I hate to be that guy, but I wanna blame it on my race, since most of those who say they get regular dates tend to be white"
college,ff334r7,t3_er52nj,1579532452.0,"I HATED college in my first year. I absolutely abhorred it. I thought everyone was cliquey and that no one wanted to be my friend. I would in the dining halls and in my room alone, that sort of thing.

Until I realized that if you want something, you’ve gotta go and get it. I read you were a ChemE major. As a Bio major I understand that your time is very limited in terms of outside activities, but keep in mind, it is very much possible to enjoy yourself while staying on track with your school work. The answer is time management.

I’m in my second semester of my sophomore year and I am in a much better place due to me venturing out there, joining clubs (literally just join a club that interests you; it may be cliquey, but that’s how the real world is), etc.

Life is still stressful lol, and I don’t think it ever stops being that way. People are still cliquey, but you just kind of learn to build your own circle. By being more involved on campus, you build relationships here and there and next thing you know you’re enjoying your weekends rather than cursing your flat mates out for playing music too loudly."

college,ff32qpc,t1_ff24qpz,1579532156.0,Why don’t you set aside some time for studying and then join them until a certain time to go to bed.

askgaybros,fev91tg,t1_fetga58,1579394562.0,Requirement seems more formal and a lot more closed off than “preference”
