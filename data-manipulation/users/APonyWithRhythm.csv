The most interaction we had was taking them out to their recreation time which involved cuffing them and escorting them to a small cell outside, leave them there for an hour and then same thing back to their regular cell. Sometimes some of them just decided they wanted to be assholes because they were bored or something"
todayilearned,ferjxwk,t1_feple5m,1579354841.0,"Yeah, not McVeigh. He’d been executed before I started working there. But the other 2 were (and I think are) still there. Terry Nichols, McVeigh’s accomplice, was still there though."
todayilearned,fep2hag,t1_fep1pb8,1579310658.0,"No, only there. I hated it there and was looking for other work for the duration of my employment. 

Maybe not that I hated it there so much as I hated that type of work. Taking meals and hygiene items and mail to scumbags who were in-turn, shitty to you at the drop of a hat. I was glad to give my notice"
todayilearned,fep05g0,t1_feozxzn,1579309184.0,Yep. Their cells are all in a row on a range of about 12 each. They can yell at each other through the hallway or through the plumbing system. They can also pass notes tied to strings

Oops. This was supposed to be a reply to another comment"
