That would be insensitive and rude and the fat friend would have the right to call them on it. But to be offended by a public social media post?  That's just self-obsessed."

Some chickens lay brown eggs, some chickens lay white eggs.  (And some lay bluish or greenish eggs.)  I swear!  I would assume that Australia has not imported the strains of chickens which lay white eggs."
fatlogic,ff60agw,t1_ff5ywue,1579615805.0,"Some chickens lay white eggs, some chickens lay brown eggs.  It depends on feather and earlobe colors!  The chickens that lay brown eggs tend to be larger and cost more to feed, so large operations will prefer the cheaper white-egg chicken strains.  I buy brown eggs from a local farmer, myself."

This always seems like a waste of emotional energy (and blood pressure meds) to me. If other people don't see things the way I do, that's fine - I don't need to protect my perspective or my self-esteem with hostility.  I'm not always right, and even when I am right, others still have the right to be wrong. 

I do wonder, though, if there may not be an evolutionary element in play: perhaps some people's survival instinct is threatened by feeling out of sync with the tribe?"

Yes, white flour is nutritionally problematic, but I had no idea that white privilege extended to foods which match that skin color."

askgaybros,fenfo0m,t1_fen5iu6,1579283675.0,This is the big take-away here: your bf is telling his best friend a lot more about you than just your taste in porn.  You need to decide how comfortable you are with the bestie knowing what it's like having sex with you.

On one hand, both ways of thinking shift agency and power over their weight to some other force that they're helpless to resist. (And we do see the classic ""meant to be"" logic.) On the other hand, I wonder if it actually might not be at least potentially better for them to locate that force in their mind and call it a disorder, as they do here.  They might learn to build on that."
weightwatchers,febfz3m,t3_eocbti,1578958418.0,"At the end of the day, a person needs to want the lasting satisfaction of good health more than they want the passing gratification of eating the foods that are tripping them up.

What's saddest is how this bad experience with a commercial diet scam that set her up to fail will discourage her from future (and possibly more sensible) efforts to manage her weight, regardless of medical concerns. Instead of blaming Ideal Protein, as she should, she blames starvation mode and believes no diet works."
