depression,ff4jx03,t3_cml6ni,1579565403.0,"I have so much anxiety to just check my phone. It died over the weekend. Just gonna do that and get some food today.  

Gotta adopt that ""don't give a fuck"" attitude because logically it's not that big a deal whatever the texts were for."
depression,ff20n4b,t1_ff1w8r8,1579490647.0,Get some food. You're not the only one struggling with this crap! We're in this together. I'm gonna make some pizza.
depression,few4ly2,t3_eqkzx8,1579405282.0,Same but my parents weren't really too normal.
depression,feieueq,t3_cml6ni,1579136872.0,"I avoided people again today. I don't even think I was productive with my free time because it was unscheduled free time. Which is often nice but often feels like I'm spending it in less good ways.  

Anyways I need to eat some food and then I'll probably try to head to a cafe."
cscareerquestions,feicchm,t1_feh4jau,1579135193.0,You can see how others have optimized their algorithms though.
depression,fefsv6x,t1_feekc2v,1579064179.0,"Thanks for sharing. That was a lot to digest.

But I hope it all works out!"
depression,fees5pk,t3_cml6ni,1579040056.0,"I'm having a hard time getting started today. I woke up late. I was supposed to go meet someone for work. It's a 2 man startup right now. But I didn't and now I'm having anxiety to text him or something.  

I think I'll just go eat soon and do some work later tonight but I don't think I'll be part of this startup long term."
depression,fecfrxw,t1_fec8dk6,1578972860.0,Thanks!
depression,febnns3,t1_feakk4z,1578960759.0,That was part of the dream QQ.
depression,feac6lo,t3_cml6ni,1578946883.0,"I started going to work. It's an unpaid thing so not sure how long I'll be doing it.  

I had a dream recently that I talked to my aunt about returning to work and also had friends who came to my place and cleaned it and no matter how much I asked them to leave saying it was embarrassing they said they wouldn't because they knew I was depressed.

My roommate cleaned a lot though and I got groceries yesterday and put everything away just now."

depression,fcw0uga,t3_cml6ni,1578014542.0,"I didn't do what I wanted to today. I spent more time in the morning on unproductive stuff than I thought I would then fell asleep after a shower.

But then I got a call and I think have a trial period job at a startup tomorrow! This is going to be good for me I think since I haven't worked in a year. But it's also a bit weird since it doesn't pay anything yet.  

Just wasting time now. I'll go eat."
raisedbynarcissists,fcu8h0u,t3_eggio1,1577975037.0,"I was just recalling all the abuse I got for washing my own dishes. Like if I didn't wash everyone else's dishes I just didn't care. It didn't matter that I was reducing the load of work for my mom by always washing my own dishes.  

There was never a moment where I knew I was at peace either. Any moment while I was watching TV she'd bitch about how she had to clean anything like mopping the table. When the table was already fine. She was just an obsessive neat freak. But still kept things her own mess with unlabeled sauces in the kitchen. Random shit on the stairs leading to the basement. She was always such a hypocrite."
depression,fct4kuu,t3_cml6ni,1577932719.0,I haven't been very productive this break. It's hard for me to do little things and if I were productive I think I'd be more confident in myself.
depression,fct2zhu,t1_fct033s,1577931535.0,Think you missed your reply button.
depression,fckwenz,t3_cml6ni,1577734642.0,"This video made it to the top of /r/all recently.  
https://youtu.be/7ZVWIELHQQY  

It's about some talk show host, Craig Ferguson, and his bout with alcoholism and depression. TLDW he was suicidal one Christmas but drank and forgot to kill himself. Then later quit drinking and 10 years later became a talk show host.  

He said something about finding other people going through the same stuff. I think this sub and discord are good ways of doing that."
depression,fcf3a78,t3_egxcz7,1577626248.0,Thanks for sharing your story. Yes I think it has.
depression,fcbapke,t3_cml6ni,1577584559.0,I feel so tired like I just want to sleep again.
depression,fcaq1xd,t3_cml6ni,1577574314.0,"I've met a few people in coop games. It's nice to have people to talk to this break. And I don't feel too bad about wasting time since it's break.  

I want to spend some time talking to my little brother but am worried he'll ask me hard questions like what I'm doing with my life.

In any case I still haven't eaten much yet today so I'll focus on that."
depression,fc9w1pl,t3_egqe95,1577559037.0,"I think of extroversion as just something people like to use to stroke their own dicks. Like they could say ""I'm so extroverted, I'm good at talking to people"".  

Same as Myer Briggs tests. ""I lied on a test and it classified me as ESTJ which means I'll make more money than the poor arts students ISPs""  

These metrics aren't as objective as something like IQ but give you the same high in comparing yourself to others.  

In addition everyone falls on a spectrum of introversion/extroversion. You might be fine talking to new people but not enjoy loud parties where you have to shout to get to someone. Someone else might be the inverse. Which one's an introvert?"

depression,fc54j2l,t3_cml6ni,1577442766.0,"Roaches ok. It's roaches. I see roaches in my apartment. Sometimes they're gone but then I don't clean a dish, my roommate doesn't, he leaves food in the sink, and they come back and I just saw one and there's too many. I need to clean but every time I see one I get scared of being near them.  

I'll see what I can clean for now.

I killed one while cleaning. Been putting this off for too long so I'll get roach killer now and clean some more. I wish I were better at keeping my apartment clean so this didn't happen. I hope roaches aren't as invincible as people claim and the pesticides work.

I'll ask my landlord for another spraying too.

I'm watching reviews on different traps and electronic repellants and these don't seem to work. The traps might idk. It's kinda disturbing to watch and I have no idea how people can get so close to bugs. I get scared. The videos make me wince and want to avoid continuing to watch them but I'll go through with ti."
depression,fbzm5l9,t3_cml6ni,1577251431.0,I'm worried my roommate will leave since I don't help keep the place clean. He's not at home. Probably with family or friends while I'm alone.
