AskReddit,ffbrfzg,t1_ffbqvpp,1579779820.0,"My mom also used to barge in uninvited, especially when I had guests. She’d usually barge in and ""try to scare us"", but I think she was just checking who I had over. Sometimes she’d just walk in my room and sit down, but the most annoying part was that she sometimes came in during the night when I was sleeping, and just stared at me (I am a light sleeper so I woke up everytime and freaked out). I told her also several times to please knock before entering, and that resulted in her knocking on the door while opening it, which just totally removed the purpose of knocking. I got tired of it at last and locked it while I had guests over. I heard her walking up the stairs, pause, and was going to fling my door open and yell ""BOO!""

...but since the door was locked, she forcefully grabbed the handle expecting it to be open and knocked her head into the door while she tried to yell ""boo"" mixed in with an ""auch"". That made her quit barging in"

AmItheAsshole,febe33u,t1_fe8il0p,1578957891.0,"NTA completely. My neighbours are like this too and it’s gotten so bad I haven’t been home since August, but getting a new place is not an option at the moment.

I live in an apartment-building and the building-manager is a pain to deal with, I had animal-control called to my place because ""they had reason to believe that I was neglecting my dog"", when I was 10 minutes away eating dinner at a friends, and my dog is a quiet one when left alone, she usually just sleeps ‘til I’m back. The only way they would’ve known that she was in there alone was by peeping through my windows and curtains. That was my absolute last straw, but instead of confronting the issue, I ran. I wish I had the guts to stand up to myself, but I unfortunately don’t, so it’s good to know that there are others in my position that actually manage to do that, even when I don’t."
insaneparents,fdn1io5,t1_fdmz1qw,1578574428.0,"Or you know, not bring her baby to another persons house when she knows the baby can’t leave the dog alone. The dog has the right to roam as it wants in it’s own house without being bothered or locked away. Imagine if I brought my dog over to your house and asked you to lock your baby in a room because my dog doesn’t get along with children? That’s insane."
AskReddit,fdkne0v,t3_elssvy,1578507178.0,"I thought you could get pregnant by masturbating so everytime I was done, I prayed to God to not make me pregnant and punched myself pretty hard in the stomach repeatedly until I was sure ""the fetus"" would be dead"

I have a hard time speaking up, especially to older adults and saying the word ""no"" in general, as I was taught that it was rude. I just recently learned that it’s ok through therapy. I still struggle with it, but it’s getting better."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fc3h7n7,t3_efqzu4,1577389736.0,"My mom pulled the ""there’s a pink elephant outside"" every year until I turned 13. It got old very fast as it was the same prank every year, so the year I turned 13, I simply texted her right after the clock ticked 12 that I was pregnant. I was in my room while I did that so she BOLTED upstairs and started screaming. I just sat there for like a minute while she yelled, waited for her to pause and then just whispered ""april fools"". 

We don’t prank eachother anymore."
sadcringe,fc1g5je,t1_fc0iidf,1577317767.0,"The only excuses that have worked for me are...

1) The pizza delivery guy is at the door
2) My dog needs to pee
3) I’m gonna go have sex
4) I’m gonna take a hit

Some of them only work for a short amount of time as a ""brb"", but the sex-one seems to be a winner if you want to leave, especially if I’m playing with neckbeards, act like I’m a dude who’s never had sex before and this is my first time. If I don’t feel like playing, I just say I’m about to get lucky even though it’s a complete lie and they let me off the hook 8 out of 10 times. Weird priorities on those people."
