The teacher even had me stand when she was giving the lesson on Thanksgiving to show how the pilgrims dressed - something I remember vividly to this day 

I loved it ... even tho none of the other kids were dressed that way and never once was I bullied. I don't ever remember any bullying going on with anyone. I guess we were all good kids, very genial with each other. I must've had 5 or 6 girlfriends - perhaps it was the knickers. 

I also remember how totally bummed I was when starting first grade mother telling me I was too old to wear knickers again."

Have you ever tried learning ASL? 

I was an Adult Ed woodshop teacher, 3 nights a week, and the first night of my 2nd semester a very pleasant young deaf man walked in with an interpreter provided by the state. 

The problem was the interpreter was only there for the first week. I was desperate to befriend him so I could work with him allowing him the full use and enjoyment of the shop.

So I chked the course schedule and saw Adult Ed was offering Beginning ASL and fortunately it was the 2 nights in between my course.

I mastered the spelling and all the necessary basics but the problem was the speed at which fluent people signed. The signing is amazingly fast 

It's a wonderfully mind's eye kind of communicating. I so wish I knew it better and had the chance to use it more

Maybe I'll take it up again seeing how my life has stagnated now thst I am completely disabled from work"

Imma an old guy, been reading books of my own choice since I was 12, hiked the deserts, slept in the forest, crossed waters out of sight of land, built houses, dug ditches and loved the woman I was with -  had some minor gains when things went right and monumental losses that would lay you low, was homeless 6 years, the last 3 of which in my car, along my favored coast - all this creating infinite words abounding in my head in no particular order ...

So I write when I can on any handy scrap of paper so fleeting thoughts can be put into words, capturing images for the mind's eye as one would with a camera... the juice of that is those ""images"" are always with me, archived in my mind disseminated thru the heart 

I would see the final crescent moon in winter months leaving for work, early mornings when the moon phase was right just before the crack of dawn with the sky still inky-night  

For years and years I had been stunned by this primeval glory, seen once a month 3 times a year, struck by the side of my truck not wanting to yet leave, even once or twice tried to capture it on old school film but nada did anything ever show

Until that one morning tooling along the hiway 10 miles from home 10 more to work with the image behind me roiling in my head when these words came to me...

*Oh sliver sliver*

*Rising late*

*Racing before illuminating sunrise*

*For through the darkness*

*Spells your brilliance*

I grabbed an empty hardware box which once held an exterior mortise lock and resting it on my knee, I scrawled it on the inside flap with a stubby carpenter's pencil while keeping my place in line, doing 65 in morning traffic

I finally snapped that pic and now I can rest, having it on me at all times, produced at the drop of a hat. That was nearly 25 years ago.

When in my youth I heard an interview with Greg Allman about how one night, working late with the band at Duane's, he crashed out on the couch on the front porch. Sometimes hours-in he awoke with the lyrics to what would become Dreams I'll Never See running thru his head. 

He felt needed to write them down before they evaporated but without a pen and paper and not wanting to rouse the silent still, nor take a chance of cracking this veneer, took a box of wooden matches from his pocket and by lighting one then blowing out, he was left with a carbon tip and proceeded to write the lyrics on the closest thing there  - the ironing board covered

After about half the box he scratched out his dream in complete, then stood the ironing board in the corner. Relieved of this vision, sated by the words, exhausted he fell into a heavy sleep. 

Around dawn, coming out of his slumber he thought he was dreaming a tune, familiar but unknown and rolled over to see Duane playing a melody on his guitar, this melody, to his words ... and it was so right and to forever be

Like a picture in a pocket

A picture may paint a thousand words but a thousand words can paint a beautiful picture when in the right hands coming from the right heart and soul

Union laborer here, tended masons laying commercial brick and block for just about 15 years, and this kinda horseshit would be dumped behind the mix tent to rust as soon as whichever boss who brung it saw what a giant clusterfuk it was. They don't have masons wherever this place is?

Unions and guilds are essential for teaching apprentices the skills, which has been the practice since the days of the Egyptians 

I worked for a contractor with 8 masons laying each, 1000 brick sometimes 1200, everyday, and half a dozen laying less rounding out the crew. 

These guys were steady eddy fast and smooth, all with at least 20 years. And good spirited too, all long as the work flowed 

And I took my work as serious as they did theirs. I could handle four of the top masons, if the material was all there, kicking in 4,500 brick everyday.

Do you think this machine can do that, six frames high on a scaffold ?

And block... 4 masons laying 700 8"" block each, with me solo tending.

Edit: i forgot to mention the ungodly amount of mortar on the floor. Mortar goes in the wall, not the floor.

Any mason dropping that much is sent to work the saw, or shown the door, or at the very least has his balls broken by the tenders.

I once asked some loud mouth self proclaimed ace, when he were all on the ground about to leave at the end of the day...

""He Dom,  you'll be working the same corner tomorrow?""

He got snotty and said, ""What the fuck why not... I'm building the lead"" 

I said in reply, ""This way I know to dump two pails of mortar under you at the start of work so I don't have to carry it up and you don't have to throw it down.""

... as I pointed at the mound of mortar under the scaffold where he worked all day, and everybody looked, with the other masons mercilessly breaking his balls while I grabbed my coat and cooler and walked away"

Whatever way you're going the key to good masonry is good trowel work. It takes many years to develop a consistent hand. Straight even bed joints laid without a string, same with head joints, and trust your eye. These are the way to a true and flat wall. Find a  comfortable technique, lather rinse and repeat over and again. Before long speed will come if you keep your moves efficient.

And don't get bent if they give you scut work, like grouting block, or laying block in the ceiling above the pipes, or spending your days on the wet saw. Be the best cut man they've seen in a long time. Whatever you do, make it your own

And take it from me, a 15 year union tender, get to know and trust your tender, if he's any good, cuz getting as much material in the wall, smoothly and correctly is the goal of everyone.  He'll set you up right, keep shit moving and may have a word or two about how the boss(es) want things. And even though he was key in laying that 750 or 1000 brick the mason gets the at-aboy.

As for these machines, horseshit. They jusr need to keep the ranks of decent masons filled

Ok?

P.s. saw your chalk line post from 7 months ago.

Red chalk is permanent, like snapping lines on concrete or wood you'll need to use for some time. And I mean permanent, like opening a wall or ripping up a floor and seeing a red line from 50 years ago... or sweeping water or shoveling snow/mud off a slab or brick ledge and the line remains 

Blue is not and goes away covers by paint which is what you.

Yellow is for snapping on dark surface like tar paper.

Good luck mate."
specializedtools,ffg438c,t1_fffufbr,1579898026.0,"That's not hollow, instead of holes to grab the mortar it's an indent called a Frog.

[Brick Frog – origins of use? | Scotland's Brick Manufacturing Industry](https://www.scottishbrickhistory.co.uk/brick-frog-origins-of-use/)

[ Brick frogs make sense for several reasons: for one, creating an indentation in the brick saved the brickmaker material. In other words, by creating a small recess in the brick, the brickmaker could make more bricks with the same amount of clay without sacrificing the size or quality of the finished product. It also reduced the drying and firing time of the bricks.

The recess also made the bricks lighter and easier to grasp. Frogs also created an extra recess for the mortar, resulting in a stronger bond between bricks.

The frog indentation also provides a very suitable location to stamp the maker’s name into every brick produced. This, in fact, is evidence of the first use of a manufacturers logo (normally makers initials, surname or place of work) to be used on mass-produced products.

Matthew Johnson, London deliberates ” I have another theory that you might want to consider. I have been renovating a 16th cent. fireplace and chimney that uses shallow red bricks, obviously with frogs. 

Before starting I had managed to source a quantity of old frogless bricks but they were slightly thicker and so I was unable to use them. When I tried to cut the extra depth off I was only able to remove the edge but the central area wouldn’t budge without breaking the brick. I was working without power tools. 

When I got hold of some bricks with frogs, I was easily able to remove the depth and not worry about the central park as it was removed already. So my theory is that when the industrial revolution began making bricks, they incorporated the frog so that their standardised bricks could also be used for the narrow gauge bricks which were prevalent at the time."" ...]

Except, frogs have been found in bricks going back to Egyptian times.

As with everything in this world there are those who collect old/vintage brick, mostly by their particular frog and or logo.

Google image search, 'Clay Brick Frog' or  just 'Clay Brick', but for the ultimate madness chk out these madlads

[Brick Collecting.com](https://brickcollecting.com/#8888)

For me this hits home as I spent the last 15 years of my working life as a union laborer, mason tending commercial brick and block, handling at least a 500,000 brick a year. 

And before that in a previous life, I was a tugboat deckhand towing fuel oil out of NYC, which entailed many passages up and down the Hudson River,  an area where hundreds of brick-making factories existed from the late 1700s into the 1940s.

During the last Ice Age in the Hudson Valley area, blankets of ice weighing millions of tons crushed the rocks of many mountains into a spectacular deposit of flour-textured, rich blue clay. This came to rest in the bays and coves of the newly carved Hudson River. In 1928, test borings made in the Hudson off the old Cofferdam in southern Haverstraw, drilled 100 feet deep and still did not drill through the clay.

There were several oil and asphalt terminals along the way we regularly called on, and if the daylight timing was right me and the mate would go trashing through the woods adjacent to and surrounding the terminal looking for signs of old brick works, as a preferable site for such industry was on the river banks. 

One key giveaway was the appearance of brush and scrub covered mounds which were usually brick piles 10 feet high and 20 feet around.
