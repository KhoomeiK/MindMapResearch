Avocados, kiwis, and bananas make my mouth itch. I don't really care. But this last year bandaids have started irritating my skin. I had no idea they were related."

First aid said I sprained my MCL and LCL.

 Doctor 1 said I had a ""sore knee"" and I could be back on skis in 3 days.

A week later Doctor 2 said ""sprained MCL, but try some light skiing and see how it feels"".

aww,fdkkbct,t1_fdkfwpc,1578505401.0,I completely agree. I nanny two boys that are pretty heavily on the spectrum. I am very grateful the parents have cameras so I can check in while they are sleeping. Sometimes the older boy throws fits in his room. The camera let's me know if I need to let him yell himself out or if I need to intervine for his safety (I'm instructed by the therapists to ignore certain behaviors unless they pose a danger to himself). The younger one wakes up easily and is hard to get back down. Once again I use the camera to make sure that he is asleep without walking into his room.
