I’m trying to help you and others understand why women are so much more upset by it then men. And it’s ok that they are. We as men don’t have to be so sensitive about their backlash against it. We should be helping them feel safe.

Let me make it more simple:

More importantly, imagine being a woman who experiences sexual objectification from men online... would you not come to believe that many of the men you meet in person are harboring such thoughts as well? Can you see how this might make women feel unsafe?
