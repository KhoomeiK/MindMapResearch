dogs,ffjfnhj,t3_etv7hu,1579997245.0,"You can address leash reactivity on your own, and muzzle train if that would give you peace of mind and you feel it is indicated. You do not want to send him to a boot camp. If you need one, a trainer can meet with you once or a few times to help out. I did it based on online resources and books, so it was under $25. But it does take the willingness to do the research and put in the training time without getting discouraged. Once we had a bunch of improvement, we did group obedience at Petsmart with a wonderful trainer, and that sped up progress a lot. Part of the exercises you learn are focusing on the handler, which really helped, and doing so in an environment with a ton of leashed dogs moving around. We had a very reactive dog in the intermediate class who was on his third try and evidently doing a ton better. Those classes were $129 for six weeks, so pretty affordable. 

My dog was very leash reactive when I adopted her and after about four months of hard work she was significantly better. We walked very early (4-5 am) and very late (after 10 PM) and had short bathroom breaks during the rest of the day. That was 4-5 opportunities to work on her training, but without shoving her into the busiest times when lots of dogs are out. 

I don’t think three weeks is necessarily enough to say there is no bond. Behavioral issues usually make people uncomfortable and scared and upset and frustrated, and that can interfere with bonding. Ultimately, you have to be the one who decides if they are going to commit the training time (you have plenty) and effort, and see how it goes. Some dogs respond to training less, some more, but your dog is going to have to have someone spend that time. If you think you can try, it could be a great thing for both of you."
dogs,ffje2dj,t3_etyr5m,1579996309.0,"I’m allergic to dogs and cats, but not a ton.

Allergy shots are another option. I have never done them, so I can’t speak to that. 

Allergies can get better and worse over a lifespan. I was horribly allergic to milk as a baby, it lessened until I was in early twenties, and then it came back but not as severe. I really didn’t realize the impact it had on my until I stopped eating all dairy.

dogs,ffiyypm,t1_ffiy6ns,1579986179.0,"Ok. So have you and your parents discussed what happens when you leave home in a few years? Are they 100% cool with the dog being their dog completely at that point? If not, it’s a conversation you need to have before worrying about vacation time solutions. 

Once you can drive, you could drive up separately and stay for a shorter period and come home to take care of the dog. If it is possible to find alternative, dog friendly accommodations then you could drive up separately with the dog. 

A month is a really long time to leave your dog with a friend. It’s a huge imposition for most people, if it is even possible. If you know someone who would not be bothered by it, you would still need to pay them, and you would need to understand that should anything happen they don’t carry the same kind of insurance a professional kennel or sitter does. It will be pretty expensive and a month is a really long time for a dog, so some dogs may not take to this well. You can absolutely use a kennel or a sitter, but you should take a look around you and identify good ones (word of mouth is usually best) and then price them out to see what it would cost."

dogs,ffhqq0d,t3_etnpmm,1579948865.0,"Who takes care of feeding, training, playing, and mental stimulation? I don’t think she is defiant (dogs don’t work like that), she just doesn’t seem to recognize the kids as having the same relationship with her. What training have you done with her in the past and who did it? Loose leash walking (including how to handle this issue) is a basic part of beginning obedience. You have to be patient to deal with this, because all you have to do is wait. You may wait for a very long time initially, but it will get better. Are you using treats? How? 

I would try building the training relationship between her and each kid, because there doesn’t seem to be one. Please stop scolding and using the crate as punishment. It’s hurting your relationship, it’s hurting her concept of the crate as safe space, and it’s not effective. Dogs don’t “apologize,” she just knows you are angry and is trying to appease you.

Basically, I think keeping her weight low (the eternal struggle) and being mindful of stairs, jumping, twisting, and impacts generally is about all you can do.

I understand the feeling of obligation to adopt an already existing dog, rather than fuel any puppies being born, so I will be looking for an adult from a breeder the next time. 

And just as an FYI, our vets bills have been $3000 in the first six months I have had my rescue mix. The economic argument is entirely on the side of responsibly breeders. If you like risk and potentially very expensive, nasty surprises, a rescue won’t be a problem. If you would like a dog that has the deck stacked in its favor (which seems kinder than playing genetic lottery with animal’s lives) then going to a responsible breeder makes sense. 

Someone will come along to correct your claims about inbreeding better than I can, so I will leave that part out of my reply. I agree that more extreme characteristics that impair dog’s lives should be dropped, and I am also not a fan of mandatory c-sections in order to have a litter. But I have experience with the heartbreak of dog’s that were created with no genetic testing, and without the kind of knowledge of ancestral health as responsible breeders bring to the project. Whoever decided it was ok to breed their IVDD carrying dachshund with a chihuahua, who may have been genetically predisposed to collapsing trachea, to make my girl is an unethical and irresponsible jerk.

This sub seems to attract some accounts that post regularly on that sub who only post here with suggestions to euthanize, commenting about breed when that is off topic, and characterizing others randomly as ""nutters"" and ""pit apologists."" I'm not sure why that is, other than folks who have gotten all wound up to crusade and who go looking for opportunities to advance an agenda. I appreciate that you don't, and I also appreciate your response."
dogs,ff9urqy,t1_ff9nmjl,1579721865.0,"The parent comment did not do any of that. It was just trolling to find a spot to shit on pit bulls, outside of that other sub. Your comment really is not an honest defense. You post things all the time that are helpful or directly address the issues brought up in the post with examples from your experience. Those posts would fall in your definition of “not trolling,” which is probably why no one has ever looked at your comment history to see if you are trolling. This particular post is not like your posts. And regarding your “they never engage” comment, sorry, I work and can’t always respond immediately. There is also no point in getting into a back and forth with a troll, which is why I am responding to you and not that other account."

Your dog needs to go to the vet to be evaluated and treated, and needs to be on flea and tick and heartworm treatment."

This is a really important issue with a lot of moving pieces. Take your time and do a bunch of reading before buying a food because someone hits the “quality ingredients” button."

I would also pick the shelter and while the dog is gone I would make damned sure that the fencing at my house and my management practices were airtight. I would research how to muzzle train a dog, buy the appropriate muzzle, and not let them step a toe outside the house without it on. Talk to the shelter people about your dog and his issues. They can be extra alert and you can let them know anything that helps."
