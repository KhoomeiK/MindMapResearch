All you can do is let it be water under the bridge. That's literally all you can do.

Try to hold on and you suffer.

I don't know why. I don't know whether the 'why' can be figured out.

But if everything will be forgotten anyway, Ill try everything. I haven't tried putting blind faith in the universe. It might be a foolish thing to do. It probably is. And yet I find myself now doing it."

Meditation,ff75zn0,t1_ff63a54,1579641798.0,"I think it's supposed to be uncomfortable, but I'm not sure how full-fledged masters put up with it if being uncomfortable is the purpose.

It makes you uncomfortable so you ask yourself why you're taking up an uncomfortable position. Because someone told you so?"
WritingPrompts,ff75bxq,t1_ff6z1m8,1579641426.0,"Haha, I would too. I'm absolutely horrid at dialogue unfortunately, and I completely ripped off 'Ruined King' from LoL's 'Blade of The Ruined King'.

But exposition like this? I can do an okay job.

Id welcome anyone to develop this further in my stead."
WritingPrompts,ff6ln63,t3_eru750,1579629834.0,"They call him the Ruined King.

Noone knows if he's real, not really. He's just another tale children tell to scare the old.

They say he was a powerful and just ruler at the dawn of time, and that he was the first to unite the hearts of men and form a society of untold power. Egypt, perhaps. Or maybe a society even older than recorded history. 

He was the first, as the story goes, to reach an age previously unprecedented - 150 years old.

The world saw for the first time what someone of his age could do, and it struck fear into the hearts of the younger factions. 

They quickly plotted to depose him, and acted just as fast. Who knew how much more powerful he would become if he was allowed to live? 

They gathered a fine group of men to kill him, but they had underestimated the Ruined King. He was far more powerful than they could ever have imagined. They took his throne, but he escaped with his life intact. It was almost as if he had let them have it. 

The Ruined King swore on that day that he would never allow a young one to grow too old. Greed and fear was too prevalent in the hearts of men, and they couldn't be trusted to accumulate the power of age that he had achieved. 

Thereupon he fled into the mountains, never to be seen again. Or so it's thought. 

But every once in awhile, some rogue dictator or powerful hermit just disappears. It's always publicly announced that they've gone into seclusion to accumulate their power, but where are they after all these years? 

Their seclusion is generally accepted as truth, because surely there's no-one strong enough to kill these old warriors. 

Unless there is. 

When he comes for you, there will be no mountain to hide behind. Gather your minions in vain, and accept your fate, for no amount of pleading will move his heart. 

He will destroy any obstacle, and take any life he deems unworthy. Such is the power of a God, to whom some pray for vengeance. 

He is the Ruined King."
GetMotivated,ff6f4ko,t1_ff6f10v,1579625835.0,Sure.
GetMotivated,ff6ey7e,t1_ff6e1ty,1579625726.0,"No. The 'wasn't sure you were asking' is a lie. Not insecurity, but to put a friendly demeanor. 

The explanation is for the benefit of others like me who take words seriously."
GetMotivated,ff687yi,t1_ff66d5c,1579621442.0,"Pretty sure you're not actually asking.

You can find it in the dictionary. It's a word.

Its often used in such a way that it implies the existence of something that isn't real.

Where is the ego? It's in your mind, not your brain.

It's your sense of worth, perhaps. Or the thoughts that appear in your mind's eye. It depends on who you ask.

It certainly isn't you. There's no separate entity that has power over you, this so called 'ego'. There's only you.

Interestingly, 'ego' comes directly from Latin, where it originally meant 'I'.

I think the confusion is that people mean different things when they talk about ego.

Edit: rip my post comes off as sarcastic and/or mocking but actually I was being completely serious, I wrote it at like 7 am aight im tired, srry op"

Psychonaut,fec11nt,t1_feacdom,1578965073.0,"I tried to think of more to say, but there really isn't anything.

I still think I want it. Which leads to the thought of frustration. But it just disappears when I let it. 

The more I write the more attached I think I feel, so I will leave it. 

Thank you."
Psychonaut,feaa4gk,t3_eo7x6f,1578946168.0,"I've listened to Watts. I think that I know words are concepts. I think that I've listened to Watts. There is actually no doubt I've listened to Watts. I'm simply making it clear of the awareness that what I'm writing is a thought. English necessitates the use of 'I'. 

What is 'I'? It's a thought. A noun. It's real, but only when given power. It's real, but only within my mind. You could say that within physical manifestation it is fake or an illusion. It's a word game. 

When put into words it sounds as if it comes from the egoic mind, but there is truly an urge deep within to give words power whenever the silence begins to set. 

When the mind quiets, feelings of unrest arise. Is it not the mind that notices these things?

You say there is a beyond to feeling and thoughts. That these are products of the ego.

I need to surrender and yet I cannot surrender so long as there is any intention to do so. I can think that I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, and yet there is no change. 

I think that feeling is everything. I can't rationalize otherwise. Being entangled in a death grip. 

When will the silence come? They say it's here. I look, and I do not see it. They say I cannot find it by looking or doing, and yet that is all that can be done. Is that mere word game? What does it mean for something to be done? For an action to be taken? 

If there is an alternative, when will it be experienced? 

It is already here. Another word game? There is no time other than now, sure. It doesn't matter. Just words. 

And yet it is not felt or thought. Apparently these things do not matter, and yet they are the only things that are thought to matter. 

It's impossible that this could be written without thought or feeling. So, it's been a goose chase? Unacceptable. It feels horrible. 

What is felt doesn't matter to anyone but me. Which means to me it's everything.

I don't know how to choose love. I don't know how or what to think, for reasons that I don't explicitly know. Mere word game or truth? What does it even mean to choose love? Nice and ambiguous.

To some I'm an idiot, to others I'm applauded for profundity.

Yes, I want to be better than I what I am. Yes, I'm selfish. Knowing that doesn't do shit. If becoming a drug addict would make me feel good, maybe that's what I should be doing instead of reading inane BS that's driving me to degeneracy.

And yet here I am."
Psychonaut,fdlalro,t3_elvil8,1578519956.0,"This is an interesting perspective because in a sense it allows anyone to rationalize potentially negative experiences from psychedelics.

But the truth is you have the power to throw a negative experience, or really any experience, away for any reason you'd like. It's the power of belief.

If you believe your psychedelic experience will singehandedly open doors for you with the entirety of your being, you will naturally stop any beliefs that are contrary to that. You will make that reality manifest.

If there is any doubt, then more rewiring is required. And so we rationalize until the day we no longer need to.

This is my opinion. There is no proof for anything. Belief is your power."
Meditation,fclvtuj,t1_fcimuq6,1577757702.0,"It can. But I've been wondering lately whether it has to. What exactly causes me feel discomfort? What makes me think certain things are discomforting? If something is discomforting, why go to the extent of literally having the thought 'this is uncomfortable'? I've been struggling a lot with this recently. Feeling it already makes it clear the experience feels uncomfortable, the thought makes you think that's who you are. 

There's also a difference between forcing my ideals on someone and helping them, if you know what I mean.

Frankly I don't feel I'm in a position to help people. I just feel like people should generally treat each other nicely. That's the only reason I butted in and said don't be cruel.

Its bc I have my own problems. 

Anyway, thanks for helping me figure out what nonsense I think I believe."
