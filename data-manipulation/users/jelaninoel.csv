Well here he is with poor Iowa results. I think it’s time he got desperate cuz the situation is looking bleak. How do you trend 5th worldwide and still come 6th, barely above Steyer. Hes not as smart as we give him credit for if he thinks he can take this approach all the way into summer. Its time to attack. Call out bernie on FJG, call out warren for wealth tax, tell pete to take yang’s wang out his mouth and stop copying him, call joe a boomer and Klobuchar to shut up for once. Become the bad guy if that’s what it takes. They  see him as one anyway so might as well embrace it."
