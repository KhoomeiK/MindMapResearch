BoJackHorseman,fdzknih,t1_fdy2oky,1578791135.0,"I make this point every time, but I still can't wrap my head around why everyone thinks this show romanticized suicide. Or ""portrayed it as a good way go get revenge on your high school bullies.""

It depicted a stupid mistaken suicide in high school and the awful effect it had on the people in the proximity. If BoJack depicted suicide, it would likely be in a very similar way because it just is the way it is. Suicide has effects.

There is no ""right"" way to portray suicide, as it is awful and controversial. But 13 Reasons Why did it decently enough if one could try and find some line between a portrayal and a glorification."
