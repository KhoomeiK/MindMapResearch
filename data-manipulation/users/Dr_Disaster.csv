civic,ffy77pr,t1_ffsnyr4,1580339901.0,"This is likely too. I imagine since the sport turbos make use of an S mode where the other trims are not, they’re probably mapped for increased throttle response. 

Dyno testing has revealed the non-sport 1.5 actually makes a few more ponies than advertised at 177 hp. The power output between the two models is virtually identical and the components are 100% identical. The only differences are the exhaust and ECU management. It has to be one of those or a combination of the two."
civic,ffy6m7j,t3_euzunu,1580339564.0,"A lil engineering info explains the difference you feel:

With forced induction engines (turbo/supercharged), changes in exhaust and intake profiles can make noticeable difference in throttle response. 

A turbo spool can change depending on the air coming in and exhaust gasses going out. If the sport exhaust set up is allowing the gasses to evacuate more quickly, then the turbo will spool a little faster as the gasses flow better, which should then translate to more acceleration/throttle response. 

This is why exhaust and intake upgrades are so popular for turbocharged cars. The ECU will adjust to increases in the airflow (within a certain tolerance) and you’ll get a faster spooling turbo and ideally a more horsepower."

nba,ffxh6oy,t1_ffx8nop,1580325069.0,I think part of Rose’s problem with the media is he’s too “real”.

He’s prone to “talking his shit” so to speak. He’s like a Chicago version of Allen Iverson. I think a lot of his early troubles with media was him not wanting to come off as a thug.

The rape trial was dropped. Kobe apologized afterward and admitted he thought it was consensual and she didn’t. He opened himself up to the full brunt of a civil case, knowing well that his comments would be taken into account and increase the severity of a ruling against him. There’s no mistaking what he did was bad, but he made the effort to atone for what he did. No one has to forgive him. No one has to consider him saint. Ultimately, it’s up to an individual’s emotional state at times like these to determine how they feel about someone.

Look at the CRZ for a smaller scale version of this. It was ultimately a disappointment  because they decided to make it an underpowered hybrid. This served no one as the people who wanted a successor to the CRX also wanted a high revving NA motor and the people who wanted a small hybrid just bought a Prius.

You can admire the product but still long for something more true to the spirit.

1.) No typical expected redemption for Kylo. He is Supreme Leader and a bigger threat than anyone could have imagined. How do you deal with him?

2.) Rey is nobody, but she now must carry on as the last Jedi. How does she rebuild the Jedi order and try to save Kylo. Can he even be saved? Is she prepared to kill him?

3.) Finn is more than just the epitome of cannon fodder, but can he be a leader? Is he force sensitive? What are his true feelings for Rey?

4.) What will become of Hux now that his rival is in control of the First Order? Does he think Kylo is fit to lead? 

5.) Luke is one with Force, but how does the most powerful Jedi in history adapt/benefit from his immortality and ability to live beyond death? What does he become.

The leaked script at least answers a lot of this while TROS spends much of its time cleaning the slate. It’s a real sequel to TLJ and is trying to make lemonade from lemons. Marvel did a similar thing with Age of Ultron. The movie wasn’t great and some people didn’t like it, but Marvel used it as a crucial event for Civil War, making that movie essentially a prologue to AoU and elevating both films as a result.

TLJ already built up the fact Kylo wasn’t going to follow that route. He’s the Supreme Leader and has the power of the First Order in his control. It would have been cool for him to embrace being the big bad and take control of his destiny. But instead he becomes a pawn again and his turn back to the light was rushed and unfulfilling.

IMO it’s a stronger story to have Ben be truly incapable of being redeemed and the others coming to terms with the fact they have to put him down for good."
StarWarsLeaks,ffdhrgl,t1_ffc4p48,1579821133.0,"And that’s why Lucasfilm ultimately went with the “safe” choice. Look, I’m no defender of either filmmaker and no fan either. I borderline hate TLJ, but Colin’s film is actually trying to be a movie that respects with Rian did, better or worse, and tries new things with significantly better arcs for Finn and Luke. It may not be perfect, great, or even good for that matter. But it’s trying to be a much more logical, original, and complete movie than TROS and sounds a lot less convoluted."
StarWarsLeaks,ffdhcmn,t1_ffcch4v,1579820884.0,"This script at least salvages Rey, Finn, and Luke. That alone makes it better. And I actually like that Kylo goes full dark side."
StarWarsLeaks,ffd8nci,t1_ffd7lw0,1579815573.0,"Same here, especially considering how this “romance” came about. Them connecting because Kylo abducted her, mind probed her, “Force Bonded” with her, then gaslighted her never sat well with me in the least bit. I’m not even one of those types to gripe about these kind of issues, but it’s all very rapey, awkward, and manipulative."

politics,ffd2kel,t1_ffd1w75,1579812163.0,Yes and unfortunately it never wants to come willingly. Conservatism must always be dragged kicking a screaming into a changing political landscape.
