relationship_advice,ff60b94,t1_ff4ni5c,1579615823.0,"Thank you for the in-depth reply. I guess I am taking too much responsibility for his path, even with an well-meaning but judgemental concern for his well being. 

My own path took years of failure and restarting before I had consistent success, I can't ""bootstrap"" him to my habitual ways.

 I think I'm feeling guilty in a backwards way. Like, if the branch above my Mother's house falls and destroys her roof, am I to blame for not nagging her about it enough? Should I have stepped in and arranged it for her? These are the exact feelings for my boyfriend's weight.

 However, I am not ""them."" I need to step back and maybe not try to puppet them, even if I thought I was doing so in their best interest. 

You've given me a new perspective to chew on, thanks again."

selfimprovement,fct622y,t3_eim6ks,1577933814.0,"Try my method: I set up 2019 to be a year of learning and doing better. I explicitly told myself not to expect myself to reach any goals that year, but that I was expected to work toward them. I turned out meet many of my goals anyway and set myself up for a very productive 2020.

Edit: Basically, see this year as a primordial stage of setting yourself up, without too much expectations, so that any progress is valuable, so you won't give up easily from frustration."
