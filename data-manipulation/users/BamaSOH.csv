Keep your LinkedIn up to date, build a better resume, build your skills and network at one job, then find a better one. 

Renting a house gets you more square footage, and sometimes a garage, instead of what you get in an apartment. Another option is renting a room, if you're young and single. Don't eat out, don't spend anything on entertainment unless you don't need that money for anything else. You don't need a fancy vehicle. Depending on where you live, you may not need a car at all.

Clay Station will dead end at Twin Cities, where you'll make a left, then another right to get back on Clay Station. The road will turn right, then left, and make another small dogleg later, but for the most part, continue south for a long time. If you're feeling like twisties, you can go left on Liberty road toward Comanche Reservoir. I haven't done that part yet. Otherwise stay straight going South through Lockeford, get some ribs or coffee if you like. If you want to see a nice burger place and bar, go left on 88 and keep looking left until you get to Clements. There's a burger drive-in with a big W on it. There's also old country saloon right there if you're feeling like a beer and meeting people. 
When you're done with that, come back down 88 to Lockeford, turn left on N Tully road, which is one of the names of the road you had been on earlier. Turn right on Jack Tone Road. It's going to turn back left, and keep you going south. 
Keep going down there all the way to Highway 4, turn left and Go to Lagorio's in Farmington. Order a half dozen oysters and get something to drink. If you're on a budget, get a big bowl of chili instead, but next time come back with money for oysters. 
That should be enough for one day. You can go back west on Hwy 4 to 99 and come back up. If you have nothing else to do, keep going east on 4, turn south a little on 49, visit Angel's camp, see some museums, find a bar. Come back north on 49 and left on 26 which will take you back to 99.

If you're looking for something else out near the Salmon Falls route, take 50 east to south shingle road exit, go left to start north, and stay to the left to continue north on Ponderosa road.

SuicideWatch,fddwp8c,t3_ekvjta,1578325825.0,"Man you have plenty of time, no need to worry about getting married yet. I know plenty of Asian guys get married after 30, which gave them time to work, earn money, practice their flirting skills, and get a wife their parents can be proud of. If you feel like a child at 24, it's because we live in a really complicated time, and 24 isn't what it used to be. 

Don't worry about what your parents think, if they're only looking after their own best interests, and not yours. You don't need to end your life. Sounds more like you need to start living it. Don't like pretending to be something you're not? Then don't do that. My grandmother used to be like your parents, always yelling about my long hair and bad grades. So what? I just went over to that house because the food was great. Life comes with a lot of hardships that will keep you busy, and there's no time to care about people's opinions. You are the way you are for a reason, much of which is their fault anyway, as you already seem to know."
