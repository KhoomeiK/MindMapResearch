The couples get to keep their own last names but the kids take their dad's last name.

PS4,fd4vdmm,t1_fd4v5uo,1578171451.0,Can't be too careful on reddit.  People basically start downvoting as soon as they read the first line of a comment. Case study: my comment's score is already in the negatives.

worldnews,fd3qkzf,t3_ejwjpj,1578160849.0,This is indeed heartbreaking. Another thing to worry about is the pollution in the air. How is Australia handling this?

facepalm,fd3em6d,t1_fd3adfa,1578157607.0,"Pronounced Nee-je-rr not Nee-g-err.

facepalm,fd3dz05,t3_ejvgpv,1578157382.0,"Nigeria, The Niger Republic and the river Niger sound nothing like Negro or the n-word. 

Nigeria - Nay-jee-ri-aa
Niger Republic - Nee-je-rr
River Niger - Nay-ee-ja
