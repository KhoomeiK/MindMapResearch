todayilearned,fdn65ms,t1_fdn5j2o,1578578360.0,"According to New Hampshire historian Fritz Wetherbee, the Cutters were kicked out of the church referenced on the gravestone because Dr. Cutter was bullying members into funding the construction of another church in town that he had pushed to be built and had so far himself funded just on his own empty promises. Caroline apparently took the expulsion pretty hard.

HumansAreMetal,fdkh4ij,t1_fdkate2,1578503759.0,"I have to agree with you to a certain extent. Yep,I've heard about that being part of legend destroying mortgages etc.  From what I heard at home, he did do this,but only one time.  It was for a struggling widow he knew.  It would be been too time consuming to find and take just her mortgage,so He stole them all and destroyed them all.  But it wasn't something he went around doing all the time.  Apparently he WAS generous with the money he stole,and often helped feed people who were hungry."

todayilearned,fdjo4le,t3_ellgp2,1578480389.0,"I love these stories... Often schools are ridiculous about things,without thinking it through.  They are assuming kids aren't smart,and should blindly follow.
 My friend has a great similar story about supporting his kid.  The school called him at work about his teen son caused a stir by complaining about the portion size on chips given out,and they were being overcharged, because bags were underfilled.  He got other kids to support him,and complaining.  They were so adamant, that it ended up going to science lab for an accurate weight measurements.  It was disruptive to classes, according to the principal.  My friend  listened to the whole thing,and asked..."" Well was he right?""  He was right!  so he pretty much told the principal  ""Then why are you calling me? "".... It was great."
Ulyssesbucketlist,fdiz64m,t3_ellci3,1578454419.0,"Learn to cook something.  On the practical side... everyone needs to eat, it feels good to have a useful skill,and it can be a great job- especially whilst in college...you'll never go hungry if you get restaurant jobs.  Also it can be fun, you can cook with or for your friends,and family. You can learn a lot,particularly patience.  It can be interesting too, especially if you are into chemistry.  Working with your hands can be great therapy too."

Additionally  I've struggled all my life with anxiety etc,and honestly knowing you need help,and having the courage to ask for help is huge.  Definitely seek out counseling at school,they have seen other students who feel this way too,and will likely be able to help you through this rough time.  You aren't alone in this!  Best regards"
