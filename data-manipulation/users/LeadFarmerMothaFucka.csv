dementia,fgk2auc,t1_fgk1q9f,1580856016.0,"I do make quite a bit of time for myself but lately I’ve been quite depressed. Not only because of my mother’s condition but a multitude of other things. I feel like I need to see a shrink but I can’t afford that right now, plus I don’t currently have insurance. I’m going to ask my mother’s doctor if he happens to know of any support groups for people in my position and in my area. I’ve got to do something."
dementia,fgk14ls,t1_fgk0tbm,1580855349.0,"It’s extremely hard. I’ve talked with my Aunt (VA nurse of 35 years) about options and she and I both came to the same conclusion that my mother just simply isn’t going to be happy anywhere. It it breaks my heart. She’s struggled all her life and I’ve rarely seen her smile outside of My accomplishments.  I’m having to slowly realize and deal with the fact that I don’t have a parent anymore. At 31. I just tell myself there’s far worse out there and that I’m lucky, but selfishly it doesn’t help my mental state."
trashpandas,fgjhrd0,t1_fgjbdwb,1580844308.0,That’s awesome of you.
dementia,fgjck4y,t1_fgjc1el,1580841203.0,"Thank you so much for the response. I’ve looked into finding support groups in my area but couldn’t find any. There are a couple grief support groups but I really just need to be around others who have been in similar positions. I have the greatest friends in the world and I know I can always call them, and that they’re always there, but I need to vent to people who have had direct relations with my scenario. I’ll keep looking for groups in my area. Hell, maybe even start one myself honestly. My mental health is rapidly declining. And I feel myself slipping. Recently lost my job, had to pull all of my 401k just to make ends meet for a little while. Car was broke down for the last month. Bills piling up. I keep having nightmares about being homeless and writing my mom’s living facility check in rags. It’s terrifying. And I’m just exhausted."
blackmagicfuckery,fgj5zom,t3_eys5w3,1580837621.0,I’m sorry... what???
illinois,fgj5gxk,t1_fgj4vin,1580837347.0,"Great advice. I appreciate that. I happen to be friends with a rather successful law office and the attorneys that own it, one being my landlord. Great group of guys and I’ve discussed appealing with them. Just haven’t filed the paperwork. Talk about frustrating though. I would love nothing more than to go after the local PD but you are very correct about the target in my back. After the paraphernalia ticket, I was pulled over 7 times in a 2 month window by only local PD. I finally had to go talk with their Sergeant, who was actually very understanding, and after that I never had an issue up until 5 years later. And the crappiest thing about the cannabis ticket was I had insurance for the vehicle, but forgot to give info to DMV when I got the car so they suspended the license plate itself which led to the pullover and search. 

Sorry for the run-on sentences."
illinois,fgj4c92,t1_fgj3wzw,1580836739.0,"I’ve not appealed. It’s been a few years also. I had a paraphernalia arrest a decade ago, and then this arrest was in 2015. Went to high school with the cop, small town crap. You know how it is. I think he heard of the dismissal and wrote a letter or something. I did have a box of .45s in the car (no gun) as I was an avid shooter for a long time. They searched forever for a gun and I told them several times that I was always out on the weekends hitting paper targets and that I was no threat nor wanted to be and had no reason to hide a firearm in my car. Hell I didn’t even know the bud was there to be honest. Just bad luck."
illinois,fgj2q2p,t1_fgj2eca,1580835860.0,"Legitimately not. Pulled over for suspended plates, led to a search in which 1.2g of cannabis was seized. I plead not guilty for 8 months (9 court dates) because the law was going to change. It changed and my case was immediately dismissed.  Two months later I got a letter in the mail stating my FOID has been revoked because I was addicted to an illegal substance. 

I have no reason to lie, let alone on a post with like... 15 comments."
illinois,fgj1ml9,t1_fgiv9q6,1580835260.0,"I don’t believe that. I was arrested for having a gram of cannabis, and by the time the court date came around they decriminalized it. They couldn’t hold me accountable for an outdated law. Case was dismissed. Then got a letter in the mail a couple months later stating that since I am addicted to an illegal substance, they revoked my card. No proof that I was using the substance at all, case was thrown out, yet Illinois revoked my 2nd amendment. A victimless crime, and most certainly not a violent crime."
illinois,fgiput0,t1_fgimmwm,1580828179.0,It’s not about applying for a Foid the first time. It’s about the appeal after an unconstitutional revocation if the card.  I had my card revoked for a case that ended up being dismissed yet they still revoked my card. Fuck the FOID and I hope the gun lobbies win in this one.
u_spoiledbratcat,fgim7fe,t3_eyqarn,1580825586.0,Peace
natureismetal,fgemmau,t1_fge6wsu,1580703350.0,Because it’s kind of awesome. But a lot of reposts.
trashy,fgbw87u,t1_fg8jirk,1580666634.0,"Because folks like that think that just because a sentence has more words in it, it must be of more importance or meaning as opposed to the quality of what’s in the sentence."
