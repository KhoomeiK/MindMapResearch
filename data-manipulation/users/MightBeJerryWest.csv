He was probably equally qualified (or more qualified) to describe something in detail just as this linked Reddit poster is doing.

Now for $9.99/month or something you can get probably a lot more with an Office subscription.

I don’t pay for many subscriptions but I can see it from a dev’s standpoint. If it’s a small one person app, once you pay $10 for that app, they never get revenue again. You’ve paid the $10 and now you’ll never be a paying customer again.

They could do the Office route where eventually they release “App 2” and require a new purchase. But then consumers are once again upset: I paid for App 1, why should I have to pay for App 2?

Devs need to make a living. I’m talking about the small one or two person operations. If this is their livelihood, recurring subscriptions seem a lot more appealing than constantly needing net new customers to buy the app for the first time."

On Sunday, the NBA was scrambling to figure out what to do. First off, it was never officially confirmed for a significant part of that day that it was Kobe. Second, fans were already headed toward stadiums and it was getting too close to tip off. Many fans believed the games should be postponed, but there was simply not enough time.

> The LA doesnt have Kobe, They belong to all of us. Everybody feel the same way about this tragedy.

Everyone does. No one is gatekeeping grief or mourning. No one is saying that Kobe belongs to the Lakers. But you can't deny the impact that Kobe had on the Lakers, his team for twenty years. This includes all of the behind-the-scenes people from security to concessions staff in Staples Center, to janitors, and so on. The Lakers organization probably knew Kobe better than the Pelicans organization or the Rockets organization, etc.

> Its like they use kobes death as a content so Lakers clippers got more hype than before. Fuck you. Really, Fuck you.

You're 100% wrong. The *Lakers* requested the league postpone the game and the Clippers agreed to it. **No one** is using Kobe's death to ""generate more hype than before"", FOH with that garbage. Fuck you for falsely accusing the Lakers, Clippers, and NBA of trying to use Kobe's death. These teams, players, organizations (*especially the Lakers*) are out here mourning or grieving. Fuck you to think that it's all to generate some BS hype.

Everyone was impacted by this death. But especially the Lakers organization (more than just the players, everyone who makes the team function) who probably knew Kobe on a very personal level. They (the Lakers as a whole) are far more impacted than the Nets organization might be, for example."

lakers,ffsy3hv,t3_ev2bbc,1580197327.0,"Honestly, if you need the money, sell it. This will be harder to do, but try to sell it to a genuine Lakers fan.

It all depends on how much you need the money. I honestly don't think you're exploiting someone's death. It's supply and demand. Only you can truly weigh an item's sentimental value to you compared to its monetary value and your needs.

For example, imagine if you had 200 level tickets to the Clippers-Lakers game and people were paying $5k for that. It'd be hard to say no to $5k cash right there. But if you value being there in person, you know that the $5k is nothing.

Do what feels right. My only thoughts are to just sell it to someone who is genuinely a fan. But also don't do any favors. Don't offer something at way below current market value...you might end up selling an item to someone who is just gonna go right back and resell it at a higher price."
