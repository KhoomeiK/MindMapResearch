Makeup,feyuuac,t3_eqwo1e,1579450806.0,"It's awesome you're wanting to help her out with this.

Firstly ensure she has a good nightly skin care routine, at her age a gentle cleanser and maybe a moisturizer is likely all she needs. Once you're certain she does this regularly then adding in removing her makeup will be much simpler and easier for her to adjust to (even if she only wears it occasionally).

It's very important to take off one's makeup at the end of the day because not doing it can harm the skin (clog pores, cause acne, etc). Also at this age it might be a good idea to get her used to putting on a good sunscreen before makeup in the morning.

A lot of good advice already stated (take her to a pro who can explain things, watch videos yourself so you're familiar with products and how to use them etc and EXPERIMENT!). 

What kind of makeup she wears will have to be a compromise or agreement between you/parents and her, she might just want lipstick or eyeshadow or blush or mascara or she may want to try it all, all at once, so that's up to you guys as a family to decide on."

tumblr,fel7z6u,t1_fekyl5j,1579216026.0,"""...according to a 2003 study in the [Journal of Biosocial Science](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12664963). Identical triplets are even less common, occurring about 20 to 30 times per 1 million births..."", taken from  [https://www.livescience.com/52613-identical-triplets-quadruplets-science.html](https://www.livescience.com/52613-identical-triplets-quadruplets-science.html) 

So there's 7 billion people, and 7 billion is 7,000 million. So 7,000 x 20 = 140,000.  
Or 7,000 x 30 = 210,000.

Scientifically speaking 'births' usually (though not 100% of the time) refers to a single pregnancy (which can result in 1 or more babies). So 20-30 out of a million pregnancies produces identical triplets. If it were to be referring to people, it would be weird as 20 is not divisible by 3 (they would be more likely to say 21-30, but not all babies are born living so them referring to people and not ""sets"" makes little sense)."

medicinehat,feafodc,t1_fe0r27e,1578948149.0,"If you've never been deer hunting it's important to note that a wounded deer (well, any deer animal or game) will take off at a dead run the moment they hear the shot. If your'e really REALLY good at reloading you can probably do it in 3-4 seconds without looking (you need to keep your eye on the deer), in which time the deer can easily be 160 more feet away. An average shot for deer is 300-600 feet. So say you've shot a deer at an easy 300 feet, by the time you've reloaded, you've got to set up a new shot at 450-500 feet. Maybe you're good at that, maybe not, but the point is the animal is now moving instead of stationary, and likely there's a few trees or at least a crap-ton of branches and bush between you and the wounded animal.

Chances are very very slim that you'll make that second shot, especially if you take longer than 3-4 seconds to reload, which means you now have to track that animal until you find it, which could take 8+ hours (at which time you could end up 10 hours from your vehicle by dark) and you're vulnerable to other predators until then (primarily bears), which yeah, is a risk you take on when hunting but typically you can pick your spot without being in a rush and you stay put there, quiet, so that you'd be able to hear a predator come your way.

Now if you can use a 10-shot rifle (10 rounds being the maximum allowed in a magazine by law currently), you can sight as the animal takes off and get off 1-2 more shots before they're out of your range/into the bush etc. That method isn't foolproof of course, and you still might be tracking for a few hours depending on how good your first and second shots were, but it's much more preferable to the alternative (by and large hunters don't want to see animals suffer)."

If you don't have a baby wearing group in your area (""official"" or not) where you can try a bunch of different carriers for a few days you might be happier with a ring sling and a wrap rather than an SSC.
