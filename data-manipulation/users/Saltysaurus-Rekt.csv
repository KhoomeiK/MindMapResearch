But they don't get a vote.  The Senate does, and the senate may or may not have the same opinion as the house.   and that's why we are having a trial to convince the Senate.   And that's why they want witness testimonies."

politics,ffr8rep,t1_ffr8adf,1580152919.0,"So then do you believe it's a fact that the evidence was overwhelming?   Or do you believe they were stating their opinion, and you disagree with it?"
politics,ffr8638,t1_ffr77wt,1580152547.0,Was the evidence overwhelming?  Well that's what we call an opinion.  But judging that you don't feel the same way.  That's exactly why they want to call in more witnesses and bring in more evidence...
politics,ffr5z45,t1_ffr2l7e,1580151189.0,"So you're against new evidence and testimony being allowed during a trial? 

So once the police charge you with a crime, the lawyers at the court case are not allowed to bring forth any more evidence or witness testimony?

Edit:  you say it's Convenient that this is brought up now.  But didnt the White House have the transcripts of the book for awhile now?   What was the 2nd article of impeachment on again?"

Guacamole is just salt and avocado as its base.  Then some people/regions dress it up with tomatoes jalapenos onion.  Salsa verde is basically those same ingredients minus the onion, and add cilantro.  :|
