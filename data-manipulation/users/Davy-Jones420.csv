facepalm,fccmmec,t1_fcceltc,1577600159.0,Damn that’s actually kinda crazy considering how many people are on this website
facepalm,fcb26gw,t1_fcap9fy,1577581286.0,What do you mean

facepalm,fcaaudy,t1_fc9xuvc,1577565816.0,"Don’t forget that he has conflicting views on racism. In one comment he says “don’t get offended at me when you are constantly using the n word” as a defense, and then turns around and post “ I think it should be ok for white people to say the N word”. Man is on another plane of existence"
facepalm,fcaaj83,t1_fca5tvm,1577565662.0,Is there a specific reason why? Why shouldn’t people be held accountable for shit they posted lmao
facepalm,fcaa8by,t1_fca9zhq,1577565515.0,Divorce one maybe but the first post that pops up is how he thinks it’s ok for white people to say the n word. Also his comment history is just him jerking off about TW3 (it’s a good game but damn) or calling people fat fucks with no lives
facepalm,fca8y70,t1_fc9vy38,1577564900.0,His taste in games is solid. Not much else though clearly
facepalm,fca8tq4,t1_fca3s13,1577564842.0,It’s a bit visible at the bottom as OP used a somewhat opaque marker. You can clearly see _of_whiterun and it looks a bit like Geralt. Man has good taste in games but legit the worst views ever on some other stuff. His user is u/Geralt_of_whiterun
facepalm,fca8jht,t1_fca7nnu,1577564702.0,Also the dude that crossed it out used a opaque marker. It’s u/geralt_of_whiterun
facepalm,fca8cbp,t1_fca51g2,1577564602.0,That’s facts. Man makes me sad he likes Witcher and Skyrim. Dudes like that make the community look bad

nonutnovember,fca810r,t1_faw7la8,1577564457.0,This nigga is the biggest virgin I’ve ever seen. He has never got shit
PrequelMemes,fc99let,t1_fc98ro1,1577549255.0,"Honestly there is something about the sequels in terms of look/cgi that bugs me. Weirdly I’m fine with the mandalorian, but yeah I still much prefer the prequels and ROTS specifically"
POTCmemes,fc92x5m,t1_fc92mpk,1577546165.0,Aye
