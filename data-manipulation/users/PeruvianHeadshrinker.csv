IAmA,ffiio2z,t1_ffi783k,1579974788.0,"In the US most psychoanalysts do additional training on top of the psychotherapist training required to get licensed and legally work as a psychotherapist. That includes degreed masters and doctoral programs that confer MFTs, LCSWs, PsyDs, PhDs and a host of other smaller more niche degrees. Often training programs will be psychoanalytic in nature but typically the hardcore psychoanalysts do further training. The path can be upwards of 10 years in some cases. Though this varies greatly because people take many paths. Best to ask WHERE they trained."
