Nobody set foot on the continent until 1821, with the first (semi) permanent base established in 1898. Now if those first bases are anything like [Scott’s Hut](https://www.google.com/amp/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/news/2010/1/100111-100-year-antarctic-hut-scott-pictures) , something I’ve seen with my own eyes, I’m sure that logging temperatures were not of the upmost concern for the most isolated men in the planet. Survival was paramount, any exploration was a bonus.


Edit: It looks like the temperature data lines up with the construction of McMurdo Station, the largest base on the continent, in 1956. It *also* looks like the 2019 high temp is where Base McMurdo sits.

TLDR: I would trust the high temperatures, but not the cold ones due to a much smaller data set."
