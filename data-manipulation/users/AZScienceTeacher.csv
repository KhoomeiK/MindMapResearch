This might start to explain this phenomenon.

In my generation, there were basically two sets of ""rules"" about nudity.  One was for being out in public, where people (especially women) were expected to cover as much as possible.  This relaxed a lot as I reached adolescence in the 70s.

But the other really didn't change much at all.  Nudity in a locker room was expected and required.

When I got to Junior High School, we had PE daily and everyone was expected to shower every day.  In fact, our creepy-assed coach actually stood by the lockers/shower area to make sure every kid was buck-ass naked and soaping up in the huge communal showers.  There were several poles in the giant tiled room each with around six shower heads.  There was lots of towel popping on each other's asses and genitals and other homo-erotic shit.  This continued through high school.

The point is, this all seemed entirely normal.  If you were one of the guys who refused to participate, you were labeled a faggot (which, if you think about it is exactly the opposite reaction) and chastised by your peers and the coach would write you up, fuck with your grade, and probably call your parents.

In a generation before mine, you were expected to swim nude in pools in places like the YMCA that had indoor pools.  It was for young Christian men, after all.

I frankly figured this was the status quo until I got into teaching.  I had a crop of really rank 8th graders that would stink to high heaven after PE.  I asked them once why the coach just let them skip their shower.

""What?  We don't have showers.""

So I was surprised and they were absolutely blown away when I told them about 50 kids all showering and trying to get dressed for class before one of our buddies put a welt on our ass with a rolled towel.

So the old fucks you see at the base probably grew up when this was normal and can't understand why anyone would be upset by it.
