astrology,fgni3me,t1_fgmub9c,1580945353.0,"I agree with this 100%, although I actually have no Scorpio or Libra placements lol. I’m only just getting into astrology, do you guys really think it shows how you connect with people in bed? Because these answers seem so varied and I always would have thought the way one would connect with others has more to do with how love has been shown to them throughout life?"
