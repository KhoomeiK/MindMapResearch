politics,ffe83b8,t1_ffe6kw1,1579839258.0,"They have GOP volunteers making calls on CSPAN, no doubt. There were a lot of them for ages on there; it's not necessarily a tin foil hat level conspiracy to expect a firehose of them now. The CSPAN call takers need a beer fund."
politics,ffe79bj,t1_ffe5dme,1579838586.0,"This is exactly how I feel, too. So many people will be hurt from no one stopping this madness. So, so many people. A flicker of hope is nice."
politics,ffe4vsr,t1_ffe4s7k,1579836765.0,And he's absolutely correct.
politics,ffdh92u,t1_ffdgs05,1579820823.0,I wonder if anyone is sneaking other video angles as we speak. We may never know.

TheWayWeWere,ff5h6ua,t1_ff4q13d,1579592704.0,"One can almost hear the crackle of the fire, or the tinkle of ice melting in the old man's scotch he's hidden just out of frame. Though, I'd imagine that's not a man who needs ice."
Old_Recipes,fepl5mo,t1_fepiyou,1579323380.0,Report back your findings; I've wondered what this tastes like for a few years now. Lol
Old_Recipes,fepkx12,t1_fepk0xb,1579323193.0,"I have to admit, the only reason I can cook anything other than Italian food at all was because my mother worked 2 jobs and left me alone to watch a ton of Food Network when I was 12."
Old_Recipes,fepitdn,t1_fepil6j,1579321600.0,"I think canned tuna use peaked in the 50s. Unfortunately, my mother never got that memo, so I still hate tuna casserole after so much of it in the 90s."
ObscureMedia,fenqyms,t1_fen5pjj,1579289565.0,"I have heard some *awful* stories about ol' Milton. Apparently, he was not a ....stellar... human being to anyone, sort of like Bing Crosby. I hope that woman survived!"

politics,fefa45i,t1_fef8yl1,1579051761.0,It's odd that it's not front page. ETA: I didn't mean on purpose. There's just so much going on.

Old_Recipes,fecxgxj,t1_fecx929,1578988565.0,I love finding this stuff on YouTube.
ObscureMedia,fecsdis,t1_fds2ebk,1578982788.0,"I find a lot of old stuff like your tape can be a bit creepy without context-- and I'm probably older than you, too! I wish there were a proper term for that feeling. I get it from things like decaying silent films or old technical difficulties in TV that were archived. It's a thing."
ObscureMedia,fecqqtx,t3_eo25oy,1578981133.0,I check here once or twice a day for this sort of thing. Nice find.
OldSchoolCool,fdp2i0g,t1_fdmgw4c,1578618445.0,"Yeah, I'm shocked I've never seen this one, either. It's a great pic."
DelphiMurders,fdkq3rt,t1_fdk7nsg,1578508808.0,"This has been my question for a while now. Task forces tend to get funds thrown at them; I would imagine the Georgia FBI budget gives them a lot of tools to use. If the ISP had nothing, though, no amount of zeroes at the end of that check will help. 

I hope I'm wrong, and I'm not picking on LE, here. Weird circumstances happen all the time. It could be anything that's gone wrong, from tainted evidence to bureaucratic red tape to an informant they can't use because it screws up another case somewhere. I'm not an investigator, so I can't even really make a serious guess. It's terribly frustrating, though."
depression,fdj81hz,t3_el7p7n,1578461089.0,This is exactly how I feel. Nobody hates me as much as I hate myself.

DelphiMurders,fd60txq,t1_fczl0mk,1578183947.0,"It occurred to me today that I wasn't shocked that a Social Services building would be that remote. 

I know in MI that they divide a county into 'service areas' by location. I used to hate having to see my worker because I was only 4 blocks from one office, but because of my address, I had to drive 45 min. to another one on the other side of town in literally the middle of nowhere. I wonder if BG knew the area through something like that, *if* he were local. I don't think he is, but it crossed my mind looking at your pics."
politics,fd1cald,t1_fd15vw0,1578129734.0,"You have a very good point, there. I admit I feel a bit lost when it comes to political philosophy, but humanity and understanding are so vital. I hope I didn't offend anyone."
depression,fd0hug1,t1_fd06hhg,1578119020.0,Same here.
depression,fd0d1nt,t1_fd04s5p,1578117094.0,"It would be lovely if those people still existed for a great many of us. Sometimes, I feel as if they are as fake as anything in my daydreams. It's not that I want it to be that way, mind you -- if anything, loneliness is killing me. I try never to dump my emotions in other people's laps. The issue for me is that I just can't trust anyone enough to be vulnerable away from a screen. Hell, even on screen is dangerous -- I could never date online, and don't get people that do (if you like it, that's cool, but it's like an express lane to serial killers and credit card fraud to me)."
politics,fczve6c,t1_fcztlk5,1578109263.0,"Whoops. I was thinking more of the Iran situation; I guess I'm a little pre-occupied with it... As far as the **Senate trial** goes, I agree with taking as much time as is necessary. You're right. This is all nerve wracking."
politics,fczrxrj,t1_fczqdxu,1578107596.0,Time is of the essence here. We can only hope that things are moving faster behind the scenes than it looks.

sanantonio,fccm6x7,t1_fccc9lq,1577600021.0,Same here. I'm used to shoveling in -15 windchills; I'll take 50 degrees in December just fine. I suppose it's the trade-off for being 100+ all summer.
