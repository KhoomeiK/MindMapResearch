londonontario,ffewx53,t1_ffe8fl5,1579868853.0,"> I mean hell, I was following some guy yesterday doing 170+ and weaving through traffic on both the 401 and Highbury. I knew I should contact the police, but was super hesitant to call 911 (which I did end up doing) because someone driving like a murderous retard isn't really an emergency.

An emergency counts as someone breaking the law and putting people into harm's way. Emergency services would rather deal with your call and have nearby officers try to deal with it than get a different kind of emergency call later that needs fire, ambulance, and police."

""Are you happier if I use French instead?""

""Es-tu plus content si j'utilise le francais a la place?""

Unless this is some regional thing, it's an informal way of saying instead/in place [of] (in this case Russian)."

RBI,ffbxzuc,t1_ffasut1,1579786370.0,"Idioms, no. But different regions DO use different French. For example, you could read a label or something that recommends that something be taken/done at the meal ""dejeuner.""

In France, that's Lunch.

In Quebec, that's Breakfast.

You have to know who's speaking to you and where they're from to know the nuance here. And that's only Quebecois vs Parisian. Toss in Swiss-French, Acadian and Creole dialects, and the colonial offshoot variations of French -- you end up with a lot of variation in word choice."
