I usually bring a protein bar or something like that for long days when I need a more filling snack, i like the Think ones cause they have a pretty good amount of protein and low sugar. Also, things like chips/crackers and hummus hold up well, string cheese sticks are ok to be non refrigerated and go well with apples."

college,ffhcc1g,t3_etl7w2,1579929692.0,"yeah i have a 4.0 right now as a junior, but had to drop a minor and adjust classes to work best w my schedule. I think managing school/work/social life is really difficult, but something that gets better with experience."
college,fe2qeaq,t3_ennr3x,1578841712.0,"For me, I started working at 15 to save for college because I knew in advanced that I would be paying for it all. I saved up a good chunk of money then and still take out loans for my tuition. Now I work about 25 hours after classes and am able to cover rent and food and all that, but don’t really have any savings for when I graduate and by loans are due. I ended up taking out loans through my school, I think it’s called a PLUS loan. I think your best bet is to meet with someone from your school’s financial office and just break down the situation, because there might be options none of us know about! Also try and apply to as many scholarships as you can, even $500 ones because they add up and can help a lot."
povertyfinance,fdy9q00,t1_fdy2omb,1578777525.0,"I would say if you’re looking up north, try Ravenswood or Albany Park, west would be Humbolt Park and Ukrainian Village, and south would be Pilsen, Hyde Park, or Bronzeville! I live more northern and think it’s a pretty good area but all of these neighborhoods have their own appeal"
povertyfinance,fdxz9to,t3_enbwtr,1578774421.0,"I live in Chicago rn, and my place is a 3 bedroom and we each pay $700 a month— which is the cheapest of anyone I know because our place is shitty and in a bad location. Honestly you are either going to have to find roommates or look for a place that is far from public transit. Places are cheaper when inconveniently located, so if you have a car I would recommend looking for a place that’s far from public transit to get the best price. Facebook is a good place for roommate searching, there are many groups that are centered around housing and roommate searches."

college,fdwruws,t3_en9a8e,1578761763.0,"I usually kept some chips or pretzels or something, microwave popcorn, fruit that doesn’t go bad easily like oranges and bananas, and cereal w/ milk because my meal plan in the dorms didn’t include breakfast! Basically I kept study snacks and breakfast food"
college,fdhrdb8,t3_elcmhp,1578428677.0,"Last semester I worked 25 hours a week between two jobs and took 18 credit hours at school, and trust me it was hard. I found myself sacrificing social time to do homework and spending all of my free time sleeping, but that honestly isn’t that bad. With my schedule, I was either at school/working from 9am-10pm every school day and then I had saturday nights and sunday off, so I spent that time doing my work. I think time management is the key and using a planner to make sure you have everything sorted out nicely. I get overwhelmed easily so writing everything down in a planner was the only way for me to keep things in track."
dating_advice,fb32t8t,t3_eb8mza,1576462951.0,"I don’t think you need to tell her that you’re more interested in someone else. I think you could keep you’re reasoning short, something along the lines of being too busy, no longer interested in hooking up, or just taking some time to focus on yourself. def a “it’s not you it’s me” situation, so just keep things kind and generic."
