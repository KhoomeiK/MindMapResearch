MapPorn,ff8ztup,t1_ff8zcoj,1579701190.0,"Well, there's more to it. The church was restored after Joseph Smith prayed to know which church to join. God said none of them. God told Joseph where to find the plates(which were a record of God's work in the ancient Americas), and he translated them when he was ready. A lot of people think he was a conman, which is ridiculous. He lost multiple children because of his beliefs. 

There is also a stereotype of Mormons being stupid, which is completely untrue. The current leader of the church is a world renowned heart surgeon."
