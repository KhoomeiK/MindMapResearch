It’s gotten better over the years but paying over $50 for any pair of headphones that use Bluetooth is a waste of money.  The Bluetooth transmission rates are going to reduce your audio quality way before a cheaper set of headphones will.

If you get a signed piece of paper from them that says they are refusing your legal method of payment than you are not liable for that debt.
