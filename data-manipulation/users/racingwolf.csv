I've searched all over but can't find anything specific to dragonflies aside from a few videos that don't give much detail.

Now, I'm going to be using this to write a Pokemon story, so the character in question is a fantasy creature that resembles a dragonfly rather than actually being one (he is a six-foot-long dragonfly-like creature called a yanmega). So there are going to be some big differences in how a creature that large would function vs. a real dragonfly. But I still want something decently detailed about real-life dragonflies that I can base some stuff off of."
