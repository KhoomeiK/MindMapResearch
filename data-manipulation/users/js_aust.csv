His opening line was: ""The bottom line is this. Trump is trying to make the Office of President an office without oversight, making the Executive branch no longer a coequal branch of Government and not answerable for any actions. ""

That is a stretch of the truth. The first leftist news article regarding impeachment came out 19 minutes after Trump took office. It has been on the mind of the left since day 1. Keep in mind, for every person who supports impeachment, there is a person who does not support it.

The bottom line is that this impeachment stands out in history for having the thinnest evidentiary record, riddled with conflicted testimony, and lack of crucial testimony altogether. Pelosi's key argument was that ""time was of the essence"" and it was ""a crime spree in progress"". Then, she dragged her feet and delayed passing the articles over to the Senate, thus proving her narrative to be false.

In reality, the Democrats should have taken there time to collect more evidence and gather testimony.

Instead, the Democrats put haste before justice.

Edit: Reminder to everyone on the left here: for every person that wants impeachment, there is another person who doesn't. The intransigence and bullying displayed in this thread is a troubling symptom of America today. 

Constantly berating someone you disagree with flies in the face of what being a progressive use to mean, i.e., being compassionate, open to difference of ideas, being actually ""progressive"". Instead, what you see here is bullying and ad hominem run rampant. It really is no wonder Trump was elected in the first place, because people who were sick of the insults and intransigence wanted revenge, and, well, they got it."

We all know it will fail in the Senate."
Liberal,fddyj6r,t1_fddxt24,1578327077.0,"What’s your point here? If you are advocating against endless wars, then you would agree that Trump acted properly when he withdrew troops from Syria, and is acting properly now by making a statement that we won’t allow for embassy attacks."
Liberal,fddxnse,t1_fddv1hg,1578326480.0,"The general in question backed various operations to target American diplomats and US military. Thanks to the drone attack, the situation near the embassy has deescalated, allowing time for Americans to evacuate to safety. Did you think that through at all? Obviously not."
Liberal,fddv37b,t1_fddubxy,1578324706.0,"He protected American lives by responding to a situation that was gaining unfavorable momentum. Without applying the pressure he did, surely the embassy would have continued to be targeted and perhaps even stormed."
Liberal,fddqlcv,t3_ekuo01,1578321354.0,"The president reacted to an embassy attack properly, effectively preventing another Bengazi incident."
Liberal,fd94eke,t1_fba6opp,1578228193.0,"Emoluments - nice obscure rule that does not actually mention who it applies to. Also, it is not clear if it applies to fair market transactions - not an impeachable offense. 

Conspired with Foreign government - Mueller Report? Barr cleared that up for us. If there was crimes committed in the Mueller report, why weren't they mentioned in the impeachment - again, it wasn't used in the impeachment, no impeachable offenses involved. 

Extortion of Ukraine president - Are you talking about the ""call""? Show me in the transcript where he ""exorts"" Zelensky. Also, why is it that Zelensky said he ""felt no pressure"" and ""had no prior knowledge"" of aid hold-ups before the call? There is no statutory crime here. Sure, not a requirement of an impeachment, but sure does weaken the case in the Senate. Show me a piece of direct evidence, and not an assumption or inference. 

Obstructed justice - When did he obstruct justice? You mean when Congress demanded a ridiculously short window of time leading into impeachment to comply instead of actually creating a case that didn't rely on ""inferential evidence"" and ""assumptions"", putting haste before justice so to speak? Meanwhile, Pelosi is actually defying the constitution by not moving impeachment along to the Senate - you don't have a problem with that? 

Endless failures to carry the duty blah blah - that is your opinion. You don't think Trump has ""done his duties"" as a president? You really think he is some rogue tyrant? To be fair, Trump has done just about everything he said he would leading into this presidency, and the people who elected him (the majority) are getting what they want. The president isn't impeachable just because you are on the other side of the aisle. 

Possible blackmail - key word ""possible"". Remember when the Obama admin targeted Tea Party groups at the IRS, violating their civil liberties? Do you think Obama should have been impeached? 

Hired illegal immigrants - Even if he did, how is that an impeachable offense? How is that relevant to his removal from office? Oh, and prove it.

Witness Tampering, and Sharing State Secrets with Foreign Powers, Using Presidential Office to illegally attack Private Companies - Not even gonna waste my time on this conspiratorial nonsense. Cough up one piece of evidence so I can explain it to you. Your rumors propagated by fringe media aren't concrete impeachable acts. 

Human-Causes Climate Change DENAIL - Not an impeachable offense. Again, you just don't like his politics. You can't just impeach someone because they are on the other side of the aisle. 

Money Laundering, tax evasion - Again, prove it. Remember when Gore funneled his money through the Mormon Church to evade taxes? Your acting like Trump wrote the book on this stuff. Show me some credible evidence that isn't a Vox article. 

Accusations of rape and sexual assault - Oh you mean like Biden, the guy Trump is likely going to be running against? 

Undermining freedom of press - OH, remember when Obama abused his power and spied on and targeted New York Times and AP journalists, blocked media outlets like Fox News from covering the White House and other newsworthy events - all actions that were hostile to a free press? Tell me, what has Trump done that even comes close to Obama's abuse of power against the First. Surely Obama should have been impeached if we use your standards of impeachment! 

Violated campaign finance laws - No he didn't. He paid off a women to keep her mouth shut surrounding an event that occurred before his presidency, and he would have still paid her off even if he wasn't running for president to preserve his reputation. Sure, doesn't look good, but it DOES NOT go against campaign finance laws. 

""American Concentration Camps"" - What happened at the border was national security issue and catastrophe. Let me ask you, when someone is imprisoned for committing a crime, do they bring their children to prison with them?"
