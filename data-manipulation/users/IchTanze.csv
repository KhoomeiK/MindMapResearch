https://phys.org/news/2016-09-mystery-teeth.html

As this article suggests, there could be a variety of reasons why leaves will have teeth on them. To protect against herbivory, could be one reason, another could be to help the leaf curl inward and keep the underside (where the holes of the stomata are) cool. The teeth could also displace heat, where as a leaf with more surface area would hold on to more heat. 

>Are any other oaks spiny?

Yes, scrub oaks, *Quercus berberidifolia*

https://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Quercus+berberidifolia

Compare with *Quercus agrifolia* or the coast live oak I have in the post:

https://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=6983

Both oaks come from a similar lineage, but they have different growth form. Most coast live oaks are tree like (some are pygmy trees, like that of the Elfin Forests outside San Diego), and most scrub oaks are shrub like and commonly dot the chaparral ecosystem. Both of these plants are said to be evergreen, as they don't lose their leaves, and keep them all year round. The plant in my post has had its leaves burnt in a wildfire, which is why they are not green. Otherwise, these oaks only lose their leaves when they get infected by a pest or the tree outgrows the leaves, not because of seasonal change.

These leaves are hard, spikey, and coated in a thick cuticle. This sort of leave morphology is very common in Mediterranean ecosystems. Southwestern Australia, South Africa, parts of South America, and southern California all share this rare ecosystem of mostly shrub dominated hills where cold ocean currents brush against a hot climate. This creates long hot summers and wet winters, but mild compared to that of a desert, and dryer than that of a forest. One adaptation to this sort of climate is have Sclerophyllous leaves.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll

>Are they one of the species that need fire to reproduce? If not how do they keep their seeds from getting burned?

Oak trees have traits that allow them to survive wildfires, but too frequent of wildfires can be harmful to populations. Include drought, bark beetle attack (native and non native insects), and man made climate change, and oak trees are under a lot of pressure for survival. The most important members of the population are the adults. Adult oak trees will create hundreds of thousands of acorns, sometimes in large events all at once called Masting Events (in order to overwhelm seed predators), every few years or so. Most of those acorns will never become trees. In fact, so few acorns will grow even in to a sapling. Fires usually wipe out juveniles, and adults are the only ones able to withstand most fires. Competition and disease keep sapling and juvenile tree numbers very low, especially if they grow closer to their parents. Dispersal is the key to survival. But who disperses acorns? Scrub jays.

https://oaks.cnr.berkeley.edu/jays-plant-acorns/

Scrub jays will fly acorns to new areas and cache them in the ground and under rocks, etc. This helps oak trees expand in to new habitat. There is obvious risk in this, as jays will certainly eat many of the acorns, and they don't always bury the acorns in the most suitable habitat. What they do do right though is burying the acorns away from the competition and disease of other oak trees, increasing their chance for a successful dispersion. No fire needed for oak trees, just suitable habitat for both scrub jays and the trees themselves."
Awwducational,fdr8kzm,t1_fdr7hgq,1578681027.0,"I study how oak trees are fire adapted to survive and reproduce. But yes I believe you are correct, with increasing fire regime frequencies, most oak tree populations will dwindle as they do not have enough time to recuperate.

Ceanothus,fcld5ad,t1_fckvztk,1577745052.0,"So I'm guessing you mean *Quercus ilex*? That's a non-native oak tree from Spain. The trees are sourced from a local organization in the region. This is important to keep native species in urban spaces, as well as limit the introduction of novel genes in to the gene pool.

Edit: maybe *Quercus suber*"

Awwducational,fckgygv,t1_fckgir7,1577725097.0,"They are introduced and expanding their range in the eastern and southern US, especially due to depredation of wolves. They are novel to the ecosystem. Since they often can't take down adult deer, they aren't completely analogous to wolves (though you could argue they are since they can and do kill fawns and sick/old deer). Their presence in certain parts of the US is controversial ecologically. Natural range expansions are one thing, moving in to anthropogenically altered habitats they didn't historically exist in before is another.
