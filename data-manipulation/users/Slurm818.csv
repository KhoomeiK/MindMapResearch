Trump is shielded by extreme loyalty within the party and has the Senate majority to back that up.  Not every President would find themselves in as favorable a position.  I like to think that with gerrymandering being slowly acted on by the court system, this will make purple states more true to that color and give real balance to the Senate.  We don't have enough people that can be held accountable for their votes at the moment.

I think Trump does care, even if it didn't come with the jail time.  Above all else is his Image.  Now he will forever be an impeached President.  That isn't a legacy he wanted and I think Pelosi really hurt him there...but did she lose the end game because of it?  Idk"

I never once stated that removal was unpopular.  I linked people to an aggregate poll that clearly shows a majority of Americans are NOT in favor of removal...which is going against the narrative /politics loves pushing.

That isn't a majority of anything, expect as a majority of people that have decided yes or no.  And if I haven't decided...that doesn't mean I think its fucking okay to remove him.
