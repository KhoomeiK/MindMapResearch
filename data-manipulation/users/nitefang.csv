Legally he did not rape her, you cannot change this, he was never convicted so as far as the law is concerned it didn't happen.

As for the victim, she dropped the charges, apparently because she got an apology and was paid off. So she is fine with what happened unless Kobe coerced or extorted her into taking the pay off.

OSHA,fdu1u8o,t1_fdtwpgt,1578726015.0,"I have done that, and I have helped teach classes like. My father is head of safety and training for an international labor union and he thinks you should only use a ladder to the extent to which you feel safe. But he also thinks that if you have spent literally hundreds or thousands of hours on a ladder you should feel pretty fucking safe on it in most situations. Know your limits and how to use the equipment. He would laugh at someone calling this sort of thing dangerous in general. If you don't use a ladder very often then sure, don't do this and keep one hand on the ladder at all times. But if anyone that I worked with was actually limited to this rule it would grind production of every movie and tv show down to a crawl and probably wouldn't prevent very many accidents at all."

For something to be caught on camera the thing needs to happen and someone needs to be filming. If a rare occupancy only happens in a place people seldom film it is unlikely to ever be filmed. But if something happens in a place that is often filmed, if it happens at all it will probably be caught on film."

worldnews,fdsy9ay,t1_fdsher5,1578709505.0,"A signature can be a single “x”, or a drawing, or scribbles, it is called “making your mark” and a baby is completely incapable of actually signing something. But if they want the baby to make its mark it can be whatever the fuck the baby puts on the paper.

Actually comparing signatures is almost useless, it does not matter if your signature matches anything anymore. The point is more that you touched the pen to the paper as a sign of consent. If you try and argue in court that it looks nothing like your signature, it won’t really matter without other evidence. Otherwise people could just invalidate contracts by signing them in strange ways.


Anyway, don’t be an asshole and you are completely wrong. The baby can’t sign shit either way but if they want it to sign it, scribbles would count."

10 years ago I was honestly somewhere between a Democrat and a Republican, and the Dems continue to annoy me all the time. But at this point it is no contest, Republicans are scum. If you like conservative policies you need a new party cause there needs to be a balance but the Republican Party doesn’t deserve any respect or recognition as a legitimate viewpoint any more."
