PregnancyAfterLoss,ffblfkk,t3_esks7c,1579771073.0,Crying. I can’t wait to be here. Thank you for sharing and congratulations on your beautiful rainbow!
PregnancyAfterLoss,ffatj4m,t1_ffastht,1579744144.0,I know I’ll be like this until I’m holding them. That ultrasound moment is always incredibly emotional. I’ve cried every single time. And I have had 5 of them. Lol.
PregnancyAfterLoss,ffatf1y,t1_ff9562u,1579744070.0,"Aw! I wanted a little girl so badly, but seeing how happy my husband was to get a boy definitely made up for it. Congratulations on your baby girl!"

sexstories,ff2ka15,t3_er9uav,1579510015.0,Sexy and well put. Might have to bake something for my husband tomorrow..
PregnancyAfterLoss,ff2jtwm,t1_ff22oi4,1579509395.0,"I completely understand. My husband is the same, and so are lots of others who have gone through it. It’s not as easy as I make it out to be. I tried really hard to be sad instead of angry. Cry instead of scream. We all have our ways. <3"
PregnancyAfterLoss,ff1t5fu,t1_feyikpp,1579485604.0,"I feel it’s not fair to be mean. They don’t know, and in not knowing and me being nice and as honest as possible, a lot of my circle (which is a big one) have learned how sensitive this question is. And have also grown quite aware of just HOW many women and men deal with this. I work in a very social setting, a ton of people who all know each other. And I actually announced all three of my miscarriages. And in doing so have had dozens of women in my work place reach out to me and thank me for sharing, knowing they are not alone. Wishing they could be as public and open about their babies. That’s why I continue to do it, in a loving and informative manner. Because I believe everyone should celebrate their babies. Always."
PregnancyAfterLoss,fewkkg9,t3_eqrqfr,1579412728.0,"I’m trying to normalize talking about loss, because I think it’s a stigma that needs to end. “We’ve lost three babies, but this is our rainbow and we are so excited!” End in a very positive note."
PregnancyAfterLoss,fejlatv,t3_epfuug,1579178742.0,One year ago today we lost our second baby. The baby that we got to see move and wiggle. The baby that our old doctor said would make it 4 days earlier. But I’m also 13+2 today. The first time we’ve ever made it to the second trimester.
