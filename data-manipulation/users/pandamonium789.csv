Apologies if you’ve already answered this and I missed it. Deferring payments or going into forbearance isn’t ideal, but it may be an option. Additionally, consider reaching out to a financial advisor at your local credit union to see if they have any options which could help."

rant,fehyn1m,t1_feh81hi,1579126510.0,"I wear men’s jeans, work pants, long sleeve shirts, and button-ups simply for the fit. Oh and a velvet blazer because it’s lined, has actual pockets on the outside AND two hidden pockets on the inside. The women’s version? Had faux pocket flaps. /eye roll"
