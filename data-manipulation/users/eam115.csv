Pretty close to the speedway so Uber’s weren’t that much especially when split between a group of people. Airbnb’s are slightly more risky because there is the chance they could cancel on you but just look for a superhost and check their reviews. You shouldn’t have a hard time finding one right now, I booked mine in like late March last year and there were still a good amount of choices left."
