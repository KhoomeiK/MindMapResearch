Fedora,ffw3pms,t1_ffvq7e1,1580282971.0,"Thats exactly what NATS does with their critical aviation message switch (AMHS). 2020 and they still run Fedora 6 Core in prod (closed network, even for international (PENS) connections). Patching of actual bugs is done by the supplier (Comsoft/Frequentis). There's rarely ever a need for 1:1 RHEL compatibility if you have already decided to not get the support (especially when you have a multi dozen million pound SLA with a company who only makes that kind of aviation software). The only reason for picking CentOS over Fedora is if you're sloppy with bleeding edge update cycles and you want to easily get RedHat support somewhere in the future."

gtaonline,fettfeh,t1_fesk1x0,1579379863.0,They could also make it less attractive by not allowing 85% to a single player. Or change the minimum amount of players from 2 to 4 (like the original heists). The desperation for people to find hosters would also indicate that requiring two accounts (and dual hardware) is already limiting the abuse of this glitch.
