AskReddit,ffhljbt,t1_ffhjwsn,1579940971.0,"Since they retain the memory of the time they thanked God, eventually they run out of players on both teams, until they all have the memory of a different win, then the loss. It's likely none of them would be willing to admit it, even to each other, that they have two conflicting sets of memories. The afterparty for the teams would likely still involve a lot of drinking, but with a whole different motivation behind it. 

Now that I think about it, they probably would spill the beans then, and a new sort of player superstition would emerge. Something for rookies to get used to, that the veterans joke with false bravado about. Getting over the ""Coulda-beens."""

This would basically make religion impossible, but the fact that things are vanishing and changing constantly wouldn't self negate. I would leave that so I didn't paradox myself out of existence, Douglass Adams style.
