>the current guideline states that a male-to-female transgender athlete must show that her testosterone levels have been below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to her first competition.

>That concentration – 10 nmol/L – is around the bottom of the range that clinicians consider normal for adult males, but is more than three times higher than the upper limit of the normal range for adult females – around 3 nmol/L.


>Testosterone has been shown to profoundly influence the way boys’ bodies and brains develop in the womb, in early childhood and at puberty.


>Testosterone during growth gives men more muscle fibres called “myonuclei”. Even if a male athlete stops training for years, and their muscles shrink, increased numbers of these fibres mean the athlete can produce more force from their muscles.


>Higher testosterone levels after birth mean males have larger hearts and lungs, on average. Females have a wider pelvis, altering hip rotation and making them inherently slower.


>And females’ tendons and ligaments tend to be looser, making them more prone to injury.


>“Males have longer and stronger bones from puberty. Longer allows for increased reach, etc, but also a wider articular surface, especially in the upper body which allows them to put down more skeletal muscle.

>“Males are much stronger in upper and lower body strength because of their different musculoskeletal properties.

>The governor probably didn’t intend for his signature immigration law to cost his state’s farm sector loads of cash. But his timing couldn’t have been worse. A shortfall of 11,000 workers—representing about 85 percent of peak employment—caused $75 million in crop losses that spring alone, with a total hit to the state economy of $103.6 million that season, according to a study by the University of Georgia. Neighboring Alabama passed an even more draconian law later that year, spurring its immigrant farmworkers to exit en masse and costing the state up to 6 percent of its gross domestic product.

Of course, you might not agree that the University of Georgia can be ""a source of historical evidence"" either.
