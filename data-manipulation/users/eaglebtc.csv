Lavalamps,ffhiab3,t1_ffhgsx1,1579936486.0,"It’s definitely something to consider.  Lava lamps come in all shapes and sizes.  While many have the same general shape of a tall, skinny hourglass, one base might not be designed for a particular bottle.  

There are two risks for ill-fitting bottles: either the lamp becomes prone to tipping over, or the bottle crushes the bulb.  Neither are good.

Ideally, the top of the bulb should be less than 1” from the bottom of the bottle."

Lavalamps,ffg52kr,t1_fffk724,1579898628.0,"That was [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lavalamps/comments/elqhrz/update_i_found_e14_130v_reflector_bulbs_from_a_us/).   The light bulb determines the power supply.  

I think OP is asking if the bottle will sit right inside the lamp base.  The slope of the bottle and the lamp base may be different so it might or might not work.  Many lamps tend to have a deeper valley for the lava to sit so it's not visible when cold, whereas Mathmos bottles are more shallow so you can see the cold lava.  It all depends."
