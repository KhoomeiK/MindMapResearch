AppleArcade,ffhzsst,t1_ffh5e48,1579960640.0,"Yea, I quit the game after playing for 30 mins, there were just too much to read.   
It also ran my MBP 13"" hot."
AppleArcade,ffhzq5g,t1_ffg5ql6,1579960566.0,"Completed Assemble with care, loved the light hearted story.  
Thank you for recommending me the game. 

I will try pilgrims,"
AppleArcade,ffhiin8,t1_ffge0yt,1579936791.0,"Tried it, love the game, but the dragon fight is impossible for me to beat.

Edit: As I wrote that, I completed the game in next try. You gotta be lvl 10 when you reach the dragon and choose the right option.  
Thank you for recommending me this game."

apple,fenpp65,t3_eq4avx,1579289053.0,Finally a cheap/free racing game for mac. Arcade is disappointing due to lack of racing games.
apple,fekept0,t1_fekdmtc,1579198493.0,"Honestly, after buying Galaxy s5, I got into watching these 'tech' youtubers. I didn't even know what Operating Systems were and **Galaxy s5 was my first touch screen smart phone.**  
It all started with 10 things to do with Galaxy s5 and ended up with Samsung vs HTC vs iPhone vs LG vs blah blah blah.

So I guess it's the tech youtubers that made me more dissatisfied with Android."
apple,fekbg00,t1_fek8aj8,1579196548.0,"I've used Android phones from 2014 till 2018.  
One of the issue, with Android OEMs, is that **they are releasing phones every month**. So even though I had Galaxy s5, s8, 1+3t and 1+6, there was something new in android world with **better features and cheaper within 6 months**.   
It is so unsatisfactory to buy a premium phone just to be one up by a mid range phone.  
FFS, midrange Samsung M30s got Android 10 and not Samsung S8.

My decision to buy iPhone X was the best decision I've ever made in regards to phone.  
It has been a little more than 1 year and I'm not bored of it because a new iPhone comes after 1 year and they are minor upgrades."
apple,fek2d8e,t3_epdjes,1579191135.0,"You should watch **'Freedom of Choice - Mind Field (Ep 5)'** by **Vsauce**.

One of the point that is made in the video is that, too many options make customers less satisfied. 

You give 'non-pro' and 'pro' option to the people, they'll not be satisfied. Non-pro buyers will think whether they should've gone for pro and pro buyers will think whether they wasted their money going for pro.  
Thats why iPhone 11 has all the latest essentials, A13 chip, wide angle lens, low light mode and portrait mode.   
While iPhone 11 Pro has the OLED display and telephoto lens, which many customers don't really care about.

Also, Apple usually has the problem of production not meeting the demand. So imagine dividing the production into 6 iPhones."

me_irl,fe2gyj5,t1_fe1qpqn,1578838243.0,This. I was about to skip the post but I saw a black scribble made on the post. But I didn't want to spoil the post by skipping ahead to the black scribble. So I read the entire post and... this fucking sucks.
macbook,fdjrz8l,t1_fdhw8uf,1578485321.0,"Thank you, the second method worked."
macbook,fdgfudr,t1_fdgfa81,1578394877.0,"Ah, that makes sense.
I was asking because I use non Apple Bluetooth earphones and even if my MacBook lid is closed, it automatically connects to my Bluetooth earphones when I switch on my earphones."

Wizard101,fcldaph,t3_ehrsye,1577745150.0,My friend and I have noticed similar behaviour. We just assumed KI is trying to make things tougher at higher level worlds by quietly decreasing our power pip chances. So we don't use higher rank spells and finish the fight ASAP
