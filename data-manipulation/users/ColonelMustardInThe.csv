Please if you haven’t by now seek therapy, or continue seeking therapy. I’m so so so sorry this happened to you, and I really think we should focus on YOUR well being here. You’re important, you were taken advantage of by a sick disgusting evil vile human being(s). But that doesn’t say anything about YOU it says mountains about THEM. And that is something your mother has to take to the grave. I hate the fucking world we live in, the disgusting fucking perverts just looking for any chance they get to find a weak young girl or woman to manipulate and take advantage of (sexually). Your story means a lot to me, thank you for sharing it. I am livid at this man for doing this to your family.

I was dosed with DMT one morning in 2016 from my LSD dealer after staying the night over. I knew if I could do something to share this experience then I must.

It all began with PE mushrooms actually, that was my first creation.

Idk, that isn’t to say I wouldn’t test the smallest amount I could on a bowl now and then for a slight buzz to ensure quality and taste but yeah I get your confusion.


In a sense I have outgrown the need to breakthrough on psychedelics, I’ve kind of burnt out on it. At least for now. Who knows what the future holds."
