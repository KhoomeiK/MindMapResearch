Games,fexcsih,t1_fewn80t,1579428793.0,"No it's not. It's derived from survival more than anything. BRs may have derived from survival too, but EfT is not a succesor of BRs..."
europe,fer5iac,t1_fer2tlv,1579350100.0,I respect that point of view. I actually identify most with 'I know that I know nothing'. I find serenity in nothingness or the lack of anything imaginable. In my eyes it ironically makes anything possible.
