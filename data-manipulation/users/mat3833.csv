isopods,ffmcvz7,t1_ffk30rt,1580052585.0,"Sorry man but I fully disagree with you on the rack comment. I own 14 ball pythons and a carpet python. I started out with 2 ball pythons in 55g aquariums and they were doing well, but they were never out. They spent all of their time in hides. I had to keep to a religious misting schedule and mix their bedding three times weekly or they would have very poor sheds and be miserable. 

I found a rack for a good price and moved them both into it. Since then my snakes are more active, seem much happier, and I haven't had a single bad shed in the 4 years I have kept them in racks. Ball pythons are naturally nocturnal, and they live in old rodent burrows in the wild. They are very shy and sometimes grumpy when kept in an all glass aquarium with any light source. I do have one ball python that prefers a lighter enclosure and she gets a semi-clear tub in the rack system and my kids have her out often. 

I keep my carpet python in a 55g aquarium, and that is due to the fact that are a semi-arboreal species that is also out during the day and night. Their humidity needs are also very different and managing their enclosure conditions is fairly easy in a screen top enclosure.

It all boils down to an animals natural habitat. I wouldn't condone keeping a bearded dragon in a rack system. Racks are suited to nocturnal animals that seek shelter in damp and dark places. Some animals fit this very well, others don't. But saying that keeping an animal in a rack is bad is very uneducated in my opinion."
isopods,ffgx0qv,t1_ffge8lp,1579917223.0,None have died since I got them all set up so I'll take that as a good sign.
isopods,ffgwydw,t1_ffgh9k6,1579917175.0,"Well I have cubaris rubber duckies and cubaris red sides,  I don't see the duckies much unless u dig around and they usually just ball up, I've been leaving them alone mostly to let them do their ducky thing and start breeding. The red sides mostly keep to themselves, if I disturb them they really don't even run away much. They more or less just scurry away at a slow steady irritated pace.

It sounds like they are actually doing well which makes me pretty happy."
isopods,ffdtukp,t3_estf7q,1579828781.0,I have a feeling I will be getting more cubaris in the future. I love the way they look and scurry about and they come in SO many color variations
isopods,ff9un63,t1_ff97vmf,1579721762.0,"There are a few people who sell duckies and other cubaris on here for very reasonable prices. Nothing like the 250 for 6 online. I got 10 duckies, 10 red sides, and a starter of Dwarf whites for 270 I beleive. PM me and I can give you more details."

There is a TON of varying information on most cubaris care, so do your research and be ready to adapt."

In the final planning stages right now. Working on cutting the glass for the shoreline and finding some interesting prices of cork bark for the background."

isopods,fdxtbp5,t1_fdxs0pd,1578772697.0,"I'm hopeful that they will work, but before I introduce them to the enclosure I will be mimicking the environment in the small sterilite tub to see how they do, worst case it gives me an excuse to put together another bioactive enclosure since I will have plenty of supplies from what I have collected.

I haven't really been able to find a good source of care information on really any cubaris species. Some people are suggesting higher humidity, some lower. Some say low 70s works fine, others suggest high 70s to low 80s. There seems to even be debate on every single aspect of care. Do you happen to have any resources you can share that may be a little more helpful than the Google searches I've done?"
isopods,fdxqzvm,t1_fdx2xu3,1578772042.0,"I was under the impression that the dwarf species and larger species could coexist just fine. Similar to springtails and isos. There seems to be a very large range of conflicting information about isopods... My paludarium is going to have roughly 36"" x 12"" of floor space. Substrate will be around 5 inches deep. I just picked up two 7 qt lockable sterilite tubs to start cultures. I have decided on cubaris red sides for my paludarium, but my wife and kids are insisting on getting some duckies as well. The duckies will probably end up in a 20x10x12 tall vivarium eventually."
isopods,fdvo9p1,t1_fdt4ovq,1578749598.0,"The main concern with the porcellio laevis is that the crocodile skinks are light eaters. An adult crocodile skink could definitely snack on some full grown laevis, but with there only being 2 crocodile skinks in the large enclosure population control would fall on me. Crocodile skinks are also very shy and spend most of their time hiding in a burrow or other hiding spaces that most isos would also enjoy staying in. I'm going to put springtails and dwarf isos of some kind in the enclosure, but I may have to culture some other isos outside the enclosure and introduce them after the skinks to avoid a population boom."
isopods,fdswy9l,t1_fdsw6kp,1578709015.0,"That's something I've been trying to look into. With the enclosure I'm making the substrate shouldn't be super wet, but it will most likely not have alot of dry area unless I add some kind of heat source.

It's looking like some species of cubaris is actually going to be ideal for my setup.

Do you have any recommendations I can look into. I've decided against porcellio laevis since they can aparently overrun an enclosure very quickly."
isopods,fdsjfpe,t1_fdph2tz,1578703902.0,"I think I'm going to go with some dwarf whites and springtails with a small colony of Cubaris. Not sure on what cubaris yet but if I don't get cubaris, it will lost likely be armadillidum zebras. I won't be introducing the skinks for at least 8 months, the reptile show is in October. And I may even hold off until early next year depending on other projects. 

I'm going to collect some wild isos this weekend and work on keeping them alive before I pick up any other Isopods. I figure it will give my kids something interesting to look at and give me a bit of experience as well."
