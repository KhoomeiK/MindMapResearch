I don't really know what you mean because you're throwing in smug low level attacks instead of fleshing out an argument. A small number of toxic people can ruin a space, the risk that you will have bad neighbours who can easily ruin events is a pretty big downside to having shared facilities.

\>  What? Apartment complex pools are private already. Shared spaces =/=  public spaces. Public spaces are a public good that anyone can enjoy. 

You claimed I was privatising public spaces, you're yet to actually point to something.

\>  Yes, I know the libertarian talking points about privatization of public  goods. Not here for a political debate. 

Not everyone with economic views more free market than bernie sanders is a libertarian, get out of your r/politics echo chamber.

\> All I'm saying is there are  plenty of families that would rather enjoy public spaces. Don't be so  quick to dismiss things just because it doesn't mesh well with what you  think is desirable.

No my analysis still stands. Tightly packed houses like this lack pretty much all the benefits of a traditional freestanding family home whilst lacking the spacial efficiency of apartments.

Yes it gives the opportunity to develop each block differently, that's probably the primary advantage, but I don't think that this is going to outweigh the reduced spacial efficiency.

\>  No, that's the assumption people make because that's what they've seen  for decades, which has then perpetuated into stupid NIMBY fearmongering  about how bad neighbors can be. There's literally no truth to this. And I  say this as someone with two young kids, so sorry, your gatekeeping  doesn't work. 

Shit neighbours are a myth? Sure mate, run with that assertion, absolutely credible.

Additionally having shared spaces makes conflicts or bad neighbours even worse. Neighbours who play loud music in their yard are bad, neighbours who play loud music in the common areas are even worse.

\>  So you're advocating for privatizing public spaces? 

An apartment complex having rules for its pool is not privatising a public space.

There are benefits to shared amenities being provided as ""privatised"" things. You often have more accountability to hold people to rules, you can have different service providers (ie. different apartment complexes) compete to provide the best public-private space (ie. the best rules for an apartment pool), a market can provide for a range of needs, you will have places aiming to provide more family focused environments whilst others are focused on other demographics."
urbanplanning,fcpeag2,t1_fclk8tj,1577860279.0,"Most people here don't even get it. The fact induced demand exists for something doesn't automatically mean increasing capacity is bad.

Induced demand 101 is that where the congestion of a system is the limited factor to how many people use it that more capacity will induce more demand since congestion goes down, often this leads to the eventual congestion being basically the same. 

Now some people look at this and say *well the additional capacity did nothing, congestion is the same*. Well yes and no, you haven't busted congestion but you've got more people able to use the service so its not accurate to say it's done nothing. You have to look at these on a case by case basis.

Shitting on people for not understanding something like induced demand is not only poor behaviour it's dumb, you don't reform by pissing everyone off and calling them stupid."

Trolls don't have to ""win"" an argument to get a victory, it's about clouding the subject matter so people get confused and sit on the fence. China is obviously and definitely engaged in gross human rights abuses against minorities (moreso than against the Han majority), some of these potentially cross the line into genocide.

\[Citation needed\] You're literally just asserting this. 

\> The public sector has to step in to make this work, whether through income assistance (section 8 vouchers), incentives for developers (LIHTC), or building housing directly (projects built and usually managed by housing authorities).

For virtually all goods systems that subsidise poor peoples incomes to boost purchasing power in the private market work exceptionally well and allow choose. So yay to cash welfare/vouchers, nay to to public housing being the only way to get the poor housed.

Capital to invest in building is not the limiting factor for how much housing is getting built in the housing crisis regions, it's zoning, public housing will just displace private investment at a massive cost to taxpayers. So vouchers (or just cash, poor people aren't stupid and should decide how to allocate capital themselves) would work.

\>  When people say the ""old, affordable houses"" are getting torn down to be  replaced by more expensive luxury housing, they are missing part of the  equation--the redevelopment would not occur on those sites if the land  hadn't become extremely valuable. And, the person who sells the ""old  affordable house"" is the one who begins the process of gentrification  the moment they choose to cash out and sell.  Blaming developers for  building is like blaming dandelions for growing--it's just what they do. 

Also if you don't let developers redevelop it'll still gentrify. Plenty of places gentrify easily without massive new construction, rich people still move in because real estate is primarily about location. The only way to have actual affordability (without wait lists) is more housing.

\>  Intrinsic in all of this is the fundamental problem of treating housing  and land as a commodity--we want it to be as cheap as possible on the  day we buy it, and as expensive as possible on the day we sell it.  This  is the engine of un-affordability, and why prices are always ratcheting  upwards. For the people who need housing, this is very bad, but for  people who already got housing, this is very good.  The only way to  resolve this contradiction is to remove land value from property value,  which would permanently temper housing prices for everyone (It should be  noted that property is usually valuable not because of the rickety old  house that sits on it, but the location of the *land*. And what makes land valuable? *Public*  investments like streets, schools, water systems, nice parks etc---so  people riding increases in land values are really just capitalizing  public investments into their private gains). 

So your solution to the scarcity of land is what? Wave a magic wand and make it cheap? Land value tax could address some of this."

Lets assume this argument is a good faith genuine one, it's not but lets run with that because it's weak enough that we don't really need to interrogate the dodginess.

If you're proposing rent control as a temporary anti displacement tool it would have to have several properties to it

1. Limited to a defined period of time at which point it ends completely in a region, you say a few months so lets be generous and say 1 year. 
2. Unlimited rent rises in between tenants
3. Never applied to new construction
4. Landlords are allow to evict rent controlled tenants for new construction
