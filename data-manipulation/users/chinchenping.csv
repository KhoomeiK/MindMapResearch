It was easier to ask a question to the persons working with you. We had huge round tables. 6 persons per table, and they had actual gaps between tables so, no space invading. As much as possible we were organised by fields. The only ones who didn't have this organisation were the bosses (who had to talk on the phone and meet the big hats so they had their own office) and IT."

The problem i have is that it's impossible for me to know if what the brand claim is true. The coffee i buy is ""fair trade"" but the label is self given (it's also organic and since i'm in Europe, the law make this one pretty safe). Soap is locally crafted by a small company (we actually visited their factory) but i have no way of knowing where they buy their base product from. They claim it's local but i can't verify this. Same goes for the rest

Best case : I pay more for a more eco/social-friendly product ; worst case : I pay more for no eco/social benefit and somebody in getting fatter. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle (hopefully tilting to the former)"
