Most popular stand up comedians/cartoonists make fun of Hindu beliefs and celebrities too speak ill of it. No one however raises their voice against any other religion because they know there will be a lot of backlash.

Rockwool is not only bad for the environment (it will sit in the landfills and not biodegrade) and also harmful to you because the particles are tiny and cause health issues upon inhalation.

Boyfriend says that I'm taking away their potential home even by taking an empty shell. But I don't take all the shells I see on the beach. I take about 5(maximum) from every beach we go to as it is a way of memories for me. I know that if every person who came to beach took shells like me then there won't be much left.

insanepeoplefacebook,fdl6k0v,t1_fdktqbd,1578517904.0,"Let's just say it is a cousin of chicken pox. The explanation I was given by my doctor was that once you have chicken pox and it gets cured, the virus is still dormant in your body.

One of the common triggers of this virus becoming active is low immunity and nerves getting hurt (I think this is a correlation and not a causation exactly coz I don't think they have been able to figure it out yet).

Anyway, it starts with intense throbbing pinching pain in your nerves and in a day or two you get huge blisters that kinda look like really huge ringworm. In fact a nurse even told me that I had ringworm and that's what prompted me to go to a different clinic and get it checked.

The blisters usually cover only one side of your body and in the worst case it takes over on the other side too.

Even after shingles goes away you'll have pain in your nerves randomly. It scares the shit of out me because I don't want it again. But I've been told that chances of an adult getting shingles again is high.

P.S. I had chickenpox vaccines as a kid. Got chicken pox too. And then when I was around 23-24 I got shingles. Yay my immune system!"

I am surprised that the topmost answer calls you an ahole. As someone who doesn't have social media apart from Reddit, I find it rather weird that people think lack of social media is alarming. Social media is useless and takes away a lot of privacy. If someone Googles my name, they will find my work profile and get all the information they need to know what kind of a person I'm. For the rest, they can ask me directly and get to know me. If this makes them think I'm hiding something, good for them. Eventually they are gonna meet my folks and know if I'm hiding a spouse/partner. Also, if I was that cunning then I'd definitely be careful enough to make groups and set enough privacy so that they don't come to know I have a partner."
