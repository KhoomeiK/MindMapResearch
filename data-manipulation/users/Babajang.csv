>Nevertheless, during the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, many successful land purchases were made through organizations such as the [Palestine Jewish Colonization Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Jewish_Colonization_Association) (PJCA), [Palestine Land Development Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Land_Development_Company) and the [Jewish National Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_National_Fund).

>From the 1880s to the 1930s, most Jewish land purchases were made in the coastal plain, the [Jezreel Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezreel_Valley), the [Jordan Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Valley_(Middle_East\)) and to a lesser extent the Galilee. This was due to a preference for land that was cheap and without tenants.
