It is interesting to me for one reason though. I grew up visiting quite a few churches from different denominations. And I remember the subject coming up a few times. And the general consensus (as I interpret it) was that aliens weren't demons or angels. But just other beings. Similar to us except that, unlike us, they never committed an ""original sin"". They lived perfect lives, free of disease, war, stubbed toes, etc. Because Satan's domain was one place only, the place he was cast down to, Earth.
