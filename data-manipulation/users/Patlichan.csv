The main ones I know are,

Adam

Abraham

Moses

Krishna

Zoroaster

Buddha

Jesus(a.k.a Issa or Christos)

Muhammad

The Báb

Bahá'u'lláh.

And about the second question, yes. We believe God sent many religions and the religions are kind of like chapters to the one true faith. We don't know how many religions god sent, but the main ones still alive today are the religions of the names I mentioned above."

The Kitab-ı Iqán

The Kitab-ı Aqdas"
