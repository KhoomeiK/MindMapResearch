The one time I did something was when I grabbed her arms to keep her from hitting me as she’d just broken my glasses and a piece of my frames had cut me right by my eye and I was bleeding. She freaked out and called the cops. I explained the situation and showed them my cut, my bruises and what has been happening.

I wasn’t sexually active, but if I had been I would have had to lie because if I did say yes my life would have been hell.

“We will do an enema and that might help. With older cats we’d do an X-ray first and maybe subcutaneous injections, but that probably won’t help on a kitten this young.”

“Do the X-ray and lets see what will help best.”

“The problem is that with kittens this young an X-ray can be pretty inconclusive, it might not help at all.”

“I understand, but can we still do one please in the hope it will help?”

“We can but please know it will cost $X”

“Yep. Lets do it.”
