ATBGE,ffgxnz1,t3_etjs3j,1579917710.0,So this is what I'll do for my son's 13th b day!
AskReddit,fffnxeh,t1_fffigea,1579888019.0,"Same here. I just went to meet up with clients for less than 3 hours then came straight home to the comfort of my bedroom and turned the tv on immediately. And my clients are perfectly nice people & I like them, but the ongoing conversation and being out of my comfort zone is exhausting."
AskReddit,ffcrr5i,t1_ffcep1k,1579805909.0,It works pretty well but paying the price with a hangover is not fun
AskReddit,ffcr5uq,t1_ffcr1st,1579805551.0,Haha yes. Real estate to be exact
AskReddit,ffcpbl5,t1_ffcgb3k,1579804336.0,"I pretty much need to match days for days. If I'm on vacation with family for a week, I come home and break down for at least a week. Im not talking on the phone, Im not answering the door, i probably wont even reply to texts unless its important. Same goes for work. Fortunately, Im in real estate so I typically have the freedom to go into hiding for a day or so at a time to get my mind recharged after dealing with people"
AskReddit,ffcov69,t1_ffcnz1f,1579804052.0,"Im sorry to hear that. I, too developed an issue with binge drinking to cope with work/social interactions a couple years ago and ended up going to an out patient treatment facility for my anxiety disorder. It helped quite a bit, especially at first. But naturally, when life gets more demanding I still tend to reach for a bottle to numb it. I wish I had advice for ways of meeting new people. Just be careful if you use the internet for meeting anyone"
AskReddit,ffco8gg,t1_ffcjqtq,1579803669.0,"Yes! We must draw others in with our quiet and humble seeming nature. I find it so odd that almost every person I meet feels some sort of magnetism towards conversation with me. I think its bc I always try to keep a positive appearance (smiling, manners, etc). Im a very happy introvert and want others to be happy, I just don't want to be their friend or talk about their kids and jobs, etc"
AskReddit,ffcnt47,t1_ffcl651,1579803406.0,Well then I am 100% introvert. Even phone calls and text messages stress me out and drain my energy. I don't think I have ever once received energy from being social
AskReddit,ffcnhnc,t1_ffcmycj,1579803208.0,"Thats exactly how it does me. Even with people that are really great & I love them, I can still handle only very small doses of them and it's nothing personal. I just prefer being at home, in the company of my dogs and the tv remote"
AskReddit,ffcn8nb,t1_ffcmqh2,1579803052.0,"Whatever your thing is, if it does the trick for you and it's healthy then more power to you. I think anime is a perfectly normal way to spend your down time. Mine is true crime and the office."
AskReddit,ffclk9x,t1_ffckt6p,1579802035.0,"It sounds funny but that's very realistic. I didnt even realize I had a pretty bad social problem until I got a career and was forced out of my comfort zone. I never drank until I started working. And I love my work, it just has its more social days or I get a client that is super chatty. I work in Real Estate so it's often an ongoing relationship, or at least months of regular interactions. But, it also gives me the freedom to make my own schedule for the most part, so it's perfect for being able to hide out and fly under the radar so I can recharge for a few days at a time. If I had to show up to a regular job every morning and see the same people, I'd probably have already went insane"
AskReddit,ffcku2k,t1_ffckb7l,1579801596.0,Going to social events after quitting anything is so hard! I have to just say no to some things if they're not really important bc I'll overdo it and end up bonge drinking too often
AskReddit,ffckkdm,t1_ffcjrg3,1579801432.0,"You've just described it perfectly. As soon as I get in my car after leaving an appointment or event I can take a full breath and relax my face and shoulders for the first time in hours and it feels so good. If it's been an especially taxing meeting, I always come straight home & watch comfort tv and eat something I love and just hide for as long as I can. Its the only way I know to recharge. If I didnt have access to my favorite shows, I'd probably end up going insane bc its my main coping mechanism"
AskReddit,ffcjnyg,t1_ffcjc8y,1579800887.0,"It makes me over share sometimes so I have to try to be careful. I tried smoking weed when i was about 17-18 and it made me a paranoid psycho every single time. I wish it had the positive impact on me like it does other people. My husband can smoke a lot and then completely function, I just cant.

Edit: typo"
AskReddit,ffciv0c,t1_ffcg66r,1579800404.0,"Yes! Im too polite to just sit in the corner and ignore people, but everything in me just wants to go hide in the bathroom and scroll on my phone. Damn southern hospitality!"
AskReddit,ffchfbu,t1_ffcbv6m,1579799526.0,"But if you're not careful, it turns into semi-functioning alcoholic or addict"
AskReddit,ffcgrav,t1_ffcd4wx,1579799115.0,"Oh I agree, it's definitely damaging. Im sitting here with a hangover today bc I had a client call and talk a total of 4 hours yesterday. I was just minding my business & watching tv, with no intentions whatsoever of drinking until about 30 minutes into the phone call. Next thing i know, Ive drank way too much bc the ""medicine"" is helping me relax and enjoy the conversation."
AskReddit,ffcfl3n,t1_ffcerr2,1579798397.0,"You're definitely not alone. I went to a day treatment facility for mental health a couple years ago and the place was full of people who appeared completely average, but were afraid of many common social things. Some hadn't even left their house in months, until they came there for treatment. Others had never been to their kid's school events, some have never had a job. It really opened my eyes to how much some people really do suffer. Im fortunate enough that I do have a spouse & a career, I just have to battle the anxiety, but Im at least good at faking it."
AskReddit,ffcf2j6,t1_ffcen2q,1579798079.0,Oh no! I hope all is well for you now. It actually did get bad a couple years ago and I ended up in a treatment facility for anxiety and other disorders. It was a big help and actually did help me cope with the demands of life surrounded by extroverts.
AskReddit,ffcenw6,t1_ffcdr5t,1579797833.0,That is SPOT ON
AskReddit,ffcdzjy,t1_ffcdqgo,1579797415.0,I have zero friends bc I hate socializing and have never been able to build and keep a friendly relationship (except my husband). I have acquaintances and clients that I'm forced to socialize with.
AskReddit,ffccwyk,t1_ffc6apl,1579796743.0,I decided to buy a Sabre printer and it has been great!
AskReddit,ffc9x5x,t1_ffc9min,1579794867.0,"No healthy ones. Im just overly polite and listen intently and engage in what people are saying. It always ends in me drinking though bc Im so nervous during the whole encounter, it makes me sweaty and nauseous and I dont even remember what we talked about bc I'm too nervous to retain it longer than in that moment"
coolguides,ffbr88t,t1_ffb0fm7,1579779555.0,Yes. It's amazing
AskReddit,ffbqbzu,t3_esr647,1579778396.0,"Socializing. Everyone thinks Im so outgoing and friendly but in reality, it wears me down mentally & physically to the point I start drinking alcohol just to be able to keep up the charade. It's exhausting and I hate it but I have to fake it to make a living"
coolguides,ffax0nw,t1_ffatmof,1579746456.0,I guess it's a matter of opinion but I love it
DunderMifflin,ffa0h7s,t3_esgls9,1579725395.0,I always stop watching when it's almost time for Michael to leave. It just makes me sad and I can't take it
coolguides,ff9qzip,t3_esecfc,1579719116.0,"I wish I had my very own taco bell. I feel like I've spent enough money there, I probably could have already attained one. Ive been thinking about that grilled cheese burrito all day"
awfuleverything,ff85m15,t1_ff8574b,1579666635.0,Wouldn't it be a bummer if he had like 3 teeth and a mullet?
awfuleverything,ff83iw2,t3_es59cd,1579665023.0,I'd sit there
AmItheAsshole,ff7m6ly,t3_es2vuc,1579652872.0,YTA and it sounds like your mom is too. How rude to ask her if she's wearing a white dress bc she already has a kid. Would you all be happier if she wore a big Scarlet 'A' on her off-white gown? Grow up. Your family is probably choosing to come to your brother's wedding bc you're insufferable
rarepuppers,ff3utnh,t3_erhcy9,1579549331.0,This is sweet. That kitty must love her so much
AskReddit,ff3mp8d,t3_erfy47,1579544338.0,I used to do this same thing with my mom's candles. I can still smell the home interior wax. Mulberry and cinnamon apple was mom's favorites
AskReddit,ff1njz8,t1_ff1jgzw,1579482143.0,That's sad. You never really can tell how people are going to react to tragedies. My husband has been fortunate enough to only personally witness one death in over 5 years of working there. But the company does experience about one death per year
AskReddit,ff1bbn6,t3_er2z87,1579477097.0,"My husband is a train conductor and he said crackheads periodically like to get on the tracks next to this trailer park and occasionally they've almost got hit. A couple years ago, a man parked his truck on the tracks and committed suicide. It was pretty sad, he was only 27 and had just lost custody of his kids in a divorce. My husband said the impact was so hard that it cushed his truck up pretty bad but his head and torso were still in tact but there was blood and beer cans everywhere. Other than that, he's only ever seen a bunch of wildlife"
unpopularopinion,fes5dha,t3_eqh2c2,1579361567.0,"I agree 100%. I actually just watched ""The boy who should have lived"" yesterday and I think everyone should watch. It's about the mental health issues of a 12 year old name Chazz Petrella who ends up killing himself. It's just heartbreaking to hear about suicides and homicides committed by these kids that haven't even finished school yet. They have their whole lives ahead of them"
