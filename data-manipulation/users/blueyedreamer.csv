vegetarianketo,fe1koy1,t3_encuwp,1578827678.0,"My Dash egg cooker is currently my new best friend. 

I know you're off eggs for ethical reasons, but I encourage you to look for small farms that free range. If you're rural there's likely many in your area that sell for decent prices. I have access to eggs like that through family members and small farms where I can literally see the pasture the chickens roam in with tons of room. Like, no guilt eating those eggs, especially from flocks with no roosters (therefore unfertilized). A hard boiled egg or two most days isn't expensive. 

Also, even cheap peanut butter with sugar added isn't really high carb! Look for cheese on sale and stock up. (Good & Gather brand cheese was buy one get one free at my local target this week and they're normally the cheap or middling price option, so they're totally worth it on sale).

Quest bars, cheapest at target, are a helpful, cheap-ish on the go snack if you need that. Currently they're buy one,  get one 50% pig off for health food items.

Costco actually has some really good prices on keto friendly food pretty regularly, though their stock does change up, so don't use it for staple items. 

Don't be afraid of the 99c store if you have one locally! Mine (and many others) has a produce section where I can get lettuce and periodically brussel sprouts, broccoli, or cauliflower in decent shape. Nuts too. The dairy section can be *very* hit or miss at stores like that, but it's worth checking."
