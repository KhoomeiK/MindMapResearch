It's not impossible to handle, but it takes more of your focus than you'd expect. If you think you're ready, and your manager does, then it's not a bad move.

As mentioned elswhere in this thread, there's like a 30% chance that it'll call for ingredient(s) that either no longer exist or never did. Having it printed isn't overly helpful, but I would appreciate the sentiment. It will always be a nuisance to some baristas, and others won't care much. It's not too much to ask, as long as you're clear and polite.

Just whisk about 4 ounces until it thickens but doesn't peak, I would advise using a very fine wire whisk, nothing too thick or soft. It'll take less than a minute if your whipping game is strong.

Edit to add: the longer you whip, the less it will collapse over time. If you lile the foam to stay distinct, go longer, if not, stop early."
