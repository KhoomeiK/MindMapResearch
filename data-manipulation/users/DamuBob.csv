In the middle of me splitting and threatening to leave my partner (again) and just generally wiggling the fuck out, a friend of ours hooked us up with concert tickets and another dosed us out.  Not remotely my first time, but the first time that I was able to see the naked truth about myself and my behaviour, to see clearly the suffering I had been causing, and see how my insistence that our problems were half his fault was utter BS and that any poor behavior on his part is a direct result of dealing with me for the last 4 years. I was able to see with clarity and surity how my lackadaisical approach to managing this aspect of my health (and just expecting my partner to carry me and pick up the slack) was quite literally stealing my life from me. I remembered that all we can do is work on ourselves, and the notion that he needs to adjust his behavior and tip toe around triggering me is BS. I and I alone am responsible for my thoughts, feelings, and actions. 

My prior psychedelic experiences have shown me that what we consider to be reality is as about as real as a stage set, and this time I realized that the reality I exist in when in a symptomatic headspace is even less real and more ephemeral, a claymation facsimile of reality at most. 

Most importantly I realized that just as Me/Us/We (what could be called god?) is always leaving breadcrumbs about what really matters (hint: its four letters, starts with an L, and rhymes with glove), so too must I start leaving myself breadcrumbs and reminders for myself for when I get sucked down into that plane of consciousness and awareness, and I realized how to use DBT skills I already knew to accomplish this. 

I would not recommend anyone inexperienced with psychedelics to try them whilst actively symptomatic like I did.

BPD,fcm8eri,t3_ehusiw,1577766986.0,"There is a avery high incidence rate of comorbidity and misdiagnosis between ADHD and BPD. Have recently realized that I am very ADHD, and a lot of my BPD typical behavior is triggered by ADHD symptoms (emotional breakdowns over feeling overwhelmed by tasks, deadlines or being interrupted, constantly feeling like anxious about time because I can never manage my time effectively to the point I have  meltdowns and use up all of the time I was stressed about needed to not waste, feeling rejected because my mile-a-minute mouth and random trivia based conversational contributions are visibly offputting to people, having a hard time getting enough sleep cause my brain just WONT SHUT THE HELL UP which makes me way for emotionality vulnerable, feeling like I must always be DOING SOMETHING, not being able to keep two thoughts together at a given time, being very easily distr-- SQUIRREL!, getting lost in thought in the middle if a conversation), etc.

FYI: ADHD and ADD are no longer classified as separate disorders, rather there are now subclasses of ADHD, in which ADD is considered Inattentive ADHD where it's just your brain that is hyper active. The other classes are Hyperactive (classic ADHD) and mixed (this is the type most misdiagnosed/missed).

Undiagnosed ADHD in children can also lead to the behavioral patterns that lead to BPD in adults 


I haven't been on my new meds long enough to give a thorough evaluation of their helpfulness, but so far so good. And incorporating more ADHD coping skills into my toolkit is helping me avoid issues that would typically trigger me. It is also helping me deal with my ADHD partner better, as we are both more cognizant of the ADHD related issues we might be having at a given moment that might be triggering for each other, and he is being more proactive is dealing with his ADHD (the mismanagement of which had been causing us a lot of problems and stress). 

If  are struggling with attention, procrastination, time management, memory  issues, have a hard time stopping and starting tasks, or feel like you always have to be DOING **SOMETHING**, I highly recommend getting evaluated for ADHD.
