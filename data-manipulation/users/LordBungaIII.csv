modernwarfare,ffe9ezi,t1_ffe5fkf,1579840342.0,"It ain’t too bad man. I found early on in the game that the Carbine is the way to go. Expect hit markers galore but I know the gun has just been buffed and it’s working better for me.  The Kar defiantly has got the power, the EBR is a bit of a pain, takes a little bit to get used to, the Carbine though, if you can just get the chest, you’re golden. I’d recommend just taking things slow since you can just unload on the dude. With the carbine you’ll be lucky to get two shots at a guy when you meet yo face to face while running around. It’ll for sure improve your over all accuracy though for all guns"

At least in some game modes that is"
modernwarfare,ffb5ess,t1_ffb46dn,1579752261.0,"Christ you’re stupid. I’ve always been a player to take the weird route to flank. I’ve also never really been run and gun, I took my time. I’m not at all glued too the ground nor a camper but I’m also not jumping around all the time like fuckin super Mario. I’m some who liked Ghosts maps and I’m finding myself not liking these maps. Can you really not see the issue or have you been buying all their games and playing their extremely strict 3 lane maps for all these years since Ghosts that when you see a slight diversion from 3 lanes it’s automatically a great map? You’ve been stuck with shit for so long that when something is slightly less bad, but still not great, you think it’s amazing. I have the wonderful position where I stopped at Ghosts which is perhaps the last decent cod. I wasn’t there when maps became only strict 3 lanes, I wasn’t there when it was micro transactions galore so I never got to get settled with the bs I’m seeing now. I come from a better time and expect their old good standards."
modernwarfare,ffb437p,t3_esjzwk,1579751269.0,"This is why I stopped playing after Ghosts, I enjoyed Ghosts but I saw what was to come. I got this game because I liked what the story could be, I liked how the maps looked like actually war zones rather than these perfectly mowed lawns and clean street maps I’ve seen from the other new cods. The ideas within this game is fantastic and the gunsmith is absolutely brilliant but this game is more like a bug with a game somewhere hidden within it"

modernwarfare,ffavm4h,t3_eshojx,1579745524.0,"What bothers me about this update, while it does some nice bug fixes, it’s main selling point is the 5 extra class slots. That’s something that, for a very long time now, has always been just part of their games and if you ask me those slots are even more valuable in this game because of the amazing and plentiful gun customization options.  Unfortunately their selling point is being well overshadowed by completely messing up not only mine but many players accounts."

That all being said, he has been very consistent though out his life, and he has even like 40 years ago said a woman can be president. The fact that Warren, first took his ideas and tried to play it as her own was pathetic and he called her out in that one debate, and now this. I may not like him but I will defend someone when being treated so horribly unfairly. I think in some aspects Warren is more off putting than Hillary"
JoeRogan,ff52ttz,t3_eqj2ev,1579578698.0,I mean there’s a simple reason for this. The Left is far more radical.
