90DayFiance,fe6bghk,t1_fe6afo4,1578886177.0,Is this a reason why they want to live in seperate houses? I wonder if when they lived in one house in Utah that they didn't qualify or something because the household made too much money with two of the moms working as well as Kody?
90DayFiance,fe69ejy,t1_fe695d9,1578884699.0,"Wow yes. If my bf said that to me (and neither one of us really cares to get married anyways but still) I would be like BYE. That's so cruel, even if you feel it does not mean it needs to come out of your mouth. Girl has no tact or respect for anyone, not even herself. Ack."

UnsentLetters,fe4gl2j,t3_enko71,1578859125.0,"I went through this same thing during an 8 year relationship in my 20's. So many times in that 8 years things seemed weird and I felt like I had been cheated on numerous times, but it was always just a guess and a feeling and was made to feel like I overreacted or was untrusting and jealous. I ended up with a case of BV once and he accused me of cheating on him.GRRR. I never had any proof so I always thought maybe it was in my head. We lived together the last 3 years of the relationship and we got engaged during the last year of being together and I was so happy because I wanted to be a wife and mom. As the time got closer to our wedding date I had done pretty much everything except order the invitations and find a reception spot. Long story short, I finally realized that although I did want to get married...I did not want to spend the rest of my life with him. So I broke it off. It was very hard for us but was the best for ME. About 6 months later he called me crying and said he needed to talk to me. I's never seen him cry before so I was a bit freaked out. Turns out he had been dating someone a few months and started accusing her of cheating and she left, the guilt from his past actions had caused karma to bite him in the ass. He confessed to me that for the first 5 years he had cheated A LOT  and it was always those times I had felt something was off, even though he turned it around to make me feel like I was imagining it. I FELT SO VALIDATED. I wasn't even mad....I felt so happy at the fact that I was right and I wasn't crazy. It was a turning point in my life and from then on I TRUST MY JUDGEMENT 5000% percent on anything. If I get the slightest feeling of something being off I end things. I hope your daughter grows from this experience and trusts herself because she will always want the best for herself. Sounds weird saying that out loud but I do it a lot and I've walked away from quite a few relationships that ended up not feeling right anymore. I recognized when someone was trying to gaslight and was all NOPE. I hope she finds someone worth her time, but let her know that it's ok to be single for as long as that takes. It's empowering. I finally found the person for me when I was 41. But in the event I get that feeling from this man (and we are 6 years into it now) I will walk away because I love and trust myself more than anyone."

UnsentLetters,fcntxci,t1_fcm5470,1577818342.0,"As an older person (almost half a century old now eeek) who has been suffering from depression for 25 years....get real help now while you are young because depression does get worse sadly. I didn't recognize in my 20's and early 30's that I had depression but since then it's become my ""normal"" and I get really good at hiding it and self soothing (like being a hermit, playing WoW, watching tv, sleeping) I have been on anti-depressants in the past but not having insurance and a regular doctor it was not a long term thing. I recognize I need that now and have yet to find a doctor to be on it long term. In the meantime, I feel when it's coming and can cope as best I can. I've never seriously thought about suicide but I can understand completely why people go that route. Depression is lonely and painful and exhausting and feels overwhelming. When you feel that urge coming on, think of all the lovely people here who have never met you, but reached out to let you know you are not alone. Don't suffer any more years just coping. You are worth more than that!! And so am I. So I'm glad I read this today because it's reminded me that I need to take care of myself as well. So thank you :)"
cats,fcclzsf,t3_e7ae1v,1577599954.0,One of our barn cats was chocolate brown. He is 2 years old now and still very brown!! For him it was just a gene mutation as we've had many black cats on the farm over the past 2 decades. This was the first brown one so I brought him inside and he is a happy indoor cat now!!
cats,fcckzb1,t3_egozm1,1577599605.0,"Oh he's gorgeous!! One of our barn kittens ended up being all chocolate brown, just a lucky gene mutation from the decades of mostly black cats on the farm. He has a teeny white mark on his chest and dark pink toe beans (and poot hole lololol) He is very long and solid and about 16 lbs now at 2  1/2 years old. He is super snuggly when he is sleepy!!

Edit: I forgot to mention that I totally brought him inside so he wouldn't disappear like most males do...he was just too cute!!"
