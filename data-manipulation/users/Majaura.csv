Overwatch,ffgmzbq,t1_ffgd0is,1579910004.0,"They want to remove the game further away from armor additions. Brig is the only char that does that now and for good reason. Overwatch is cancerous with additional HP abilities, we've learned this the hard way. It's also hard to say how McCree will fair with the firerate going back to the older one, but gaining 50 hp.

Also for the record I DO think 250 for McCree is good, I was replying to the OP saying 250 for Pharah makes zero sense."
Overwatch,fffzjeg,t3_ete59q,1579895218.0,"This is literally turning into Oprahwatch. YOU GET 250, YOU GET 250...

Not every character needs 250 HP, man. That being said I saw some people saying Sym should get 250, and I could see an argument for that, especially since she has to play way closer than McCree. 

McCree is a squishy guy no matter how you look at it...

and as long as Pharahmercy exist she doesn't need 200 HP."
Overwatch,fff5lz7,t3_et1nl9,1579876299.0,"I'm so fucking over these Hanzo nerfs man. They're just becoming so unnecessary. It's probably a byproduct of shields being nerfed, but man he just gets nerfed every single patch. Also Baptiste gun feels like trash again. I would love if they could keep the RoF but change something else. His RoF feels so smooth but it feels really clunky at the previous slower RoF."
Games,ffbf20c,t1_ffbchuk,1579762496.0,"I respect all of that, I just feel like the execution is super weak. I understand what's going on with all of the characters, but it just comes off super cliched and weak..especially Eddie. Angela never really amounts to anything more than a sad sack as well."
Games,ffb85tv,t1_ffad8io,1579754635.0,"I didn't so much mean the concept of psychological monsters as much as like A GOOD overall video game story. 

I actually can't really think of another video game off the top of my head that went for the psychological monsters existing only in the head of the character, but I'm sure there's a shit load of games that do it TODAY. SH2 came out in 2001, so there's also a 20 year gap of video games that came out so I think SH2 deserves credit for really pushing something so unconventional. I think the game did all of what it set out to do, but it's just sort of shoddy and blah at times."
Games,ffb7uhz,t1_ffalhey,1579754329.0,"I read through my post and sort of realized that I wasn't really saying WHY and kept repeating myself. I would just say the story, the voice acting, the character development. James is a pretty flat character for me, Angela is completely unremarkable...Eddie is just like an awkward evil guy...Maria is another flat character that takes on this weird seductress role.
 It just didn't connect with me as much as future video games, once again SH2 being from 2001, it's pretty damn good for it's time. 

Something that hasn't aged a milisecond is the soundtrack...the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I really like the atmosphere too. I think people think I just want to shit on the game, so naturally they downvote...which is cool, that's why reddit is considered a vacuum, though. The voice acting is also just straight up garbage, and the majority of SH2 diehards fight this and say it's ""stilted""...because the game world is strange and supernatural...I think that's a bullshit excuse to cover up really bad voice acting. The word ""stilted"" is used synonymously with Silent Hill 2's voice acting and it's a really big cop out to defend the super bad voice work."
Games,ffacwjh,t1_ffabzz5,1579732580.0,"I think there's a lot of things SH2 did right. The OST is definitely amazing. I think basically everything is amazing except for a few puzzles but the story sort of aged poorly for me. I can't see SH2 being looked at as a stronger game than TLOU, strictly speaking in terms of stories here. If I had to compare TLOU vs SH2, story vs story, I would say that TLOU wins in every conceivable possibility and by miles, like scored 100 vs 15 or something.

Don't get me wrong I definitely LOVED SH2, and it's unlike anything I could have played at that time (2001) and it would have been completely lost on me if I played it when it came out (I would have been 11). Also did you mean ""The Road"" and not ""The Last Road""? I also can't deny that TLOU came in on the tail end of the zombies craze, which I miss dearly...I do love a good zombie craze, I'm sort of bummed that it died out."
Games,ffabp2u,t1_ffab6ol,1579731772.0,"I'm not involved in that cancerous circlejerk of a subreddit, I'm just saying if your computer can't run Terraria, you can't really consider it as a computer outside of maybe typing word documents...and at that point, it's essentially a typewriter. I have a shitty laptop from 2013 that can run Terraria."
Games,ffab0wi,t1_ff9mdr2,1579731382.0,"If your laptop can't run Terraria you're using one of those 1985 computers from Stranger Things. I'm not saying you can somehow miraculously afford a computer, I'm just saying that your laptop isn't a computer."
Games,ffa9vfs,t3_esf6cp,1579730719.0,"I really like Silent Hill but SH2 is one of the most overrated stories of all time. It's a pretty good game for its time. I can almost guarantee there isn't a game that came close to the tone and story in 2001, but it also simply didn't age well. I beat the game in 2018 and while I thoroughly enjoyed it, I was sort of just like ""okay...cool but I've seen this 100 times before and in much better ways"".

I'm not even shitting on the game and I know I'll be at like -15 downvotes, but I just feel like it's a really overblown game speaking strictly in terms of the modern era of storytelling in games. Indie games and even some AAA games have touched on the subjects of SH2 in a much better fashion... The Last of Us would be an example of a video game that has aged incredibly well in terms of story and won't really ever become obsolete. The story of SH2 aged really poorly in my eyes..."
Overwatch,fezyfdl,t3_eqxu94,1579463250.0,I have no idea what we're seeing. What exactly is this?
Overwatch,fenu9wb,t3_eq4yag,1579290836.0,"We need a little more evidence on this one. Are you sure you had low ping? This could be a slight issue with ping, that's what I immediately though since it just looks like it. Not trying to be that ""TURN IT ON AND OFF AGAIN"" guy."
Games,fel0pk5,t1_fekzn81,1579211559.0,"I got downvoted for saying I would ditch my consoles if TLOU came to PC, why is that even downvote worthy? People are snowflakes on reddit."

Games,fekjtkg,t3_epnsty,1579201541.0,"If this means The Last of Us has a chance, I would smash all of my consoles into tiny little bits. I really hope this happens...

Edit: holy shit the downvotes, relax people. I'm sorry I don't want to play video games on an ancient shitty children's toy."
Overwatch,fefzwv6,t1_fef754l,1579071062.0,If there's one thing we need in Overwatch it's more attention to DPS...

Games,fedp6zb,t1_fednh4m,1579016881.0,"I don't really think that happened until like Snake or Bayonetta. It annoyed me at first how some characters didn't fit, but it is what it is now and they just add any sort of video game character so if CJ from San Andreas was added I wouldn't be shocked."
Overwatch,fdruf3j,t1_fdrjqlx,1578689896.0,"I think it's a really really bad change. His arrow feels incredibly good, and it feels perfected at the exact speed that it's at. It was so so so bad back in the day, if you had a Hanzo it was considered a throw pick and I don't really think Storm Arrow is going to make up the different of Scatter."
Games,fdrfntj,t3_emclxt,1578683867.0,"I remember feeling like the first Def Jam wrestling game was a bit flat, but still really cool for what it was... and Fight for NY is honestly the last wrestling game that I played that really blew me away. I remember buying it day 1 and realizing so quickly that it was such an amazing game...on paper the game sounds so horrible, but it was such an awesome game in so many ways."
Overwatch,fdpg9ux,t3_emghpx,1578627850.0,"I usually agree with buffs and nerfs but I don't see the point of nerfing Hanzo's projectile speed. It's just going to make him feel awful. I vividly remember how frustrating it was to play him with super slow projectile speed.  There's other ways to change him, and his projectile speed pre-rework felt so incredibly poopie. Also JESSSUUUS that Immortality nerf is massive."
Overwatch,fdkbv58,t1_fdjsgg2,1578500588.0,Yeah but I basically already have everything...

Overwatch,fdj1tdi,t1_fdiqr4l,1578456250.0,Yeah but it's going to cost an ass load of money. There's at LEAST two teams that this is happening with. It just feels a bit meh to me.

Yeah, I don't look at it like you're some scavenger...I think most people WOULD sell those items for more money if they could but they're just too stupid. They aren't just apathetic like that person made it out to be. People selling things on Facebook are already a few rungs down the ladder, I would never consider selling anything on Facebook."

Overwatch,fcjswfy,t3_eh3lkl,1577703043.0,"Overwatch will bounce back...it always does. We'll have so much new content in 2020, it's just a matter of waiting. Overwatch 2 will be such a fun experience for so many different types of players.

Overwatch is in a mild hibernation state, and we'll get a new character before OW2 that will hopefully make new changes to the game. I just hope OW2 adds more tanks and supports than DPS. We need all 3 roles to be equal in characters.

It's also normal for people to get bored of playing the same game for such a long time. People are bound to take breaks from Overwatch, but if the game has a solid foundation the fans will always return to the game, no matter how long they may take a break."
