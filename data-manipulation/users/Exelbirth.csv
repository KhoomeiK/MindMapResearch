When the choices were ""fuck you middle and lower class (hillary)"" and ""take a gamble (trump),"" why would you think anyone was an idiot for going with the take a gamble option?  Knowing eating arsenic seems more idiotic than drinking the clear liquid and hoping it'll be water instead of bleach.  The level of disdain you have for your fellow man demonstrates perfectly why your claim of not being a ""hardcore Sanders supporter"" is accurate.  Why are you even in this subreddit then?

SandersForPresident,fglaltz,t1_fgk0p0b,1580888325.0,"During the 2016 election, Trump espoused numerous positions similar to Sanders' platform: The trade deals were fucking over the working class, too many people are dying to a lack of health care and Europe has better health care than the US, etc.  When faced with Hillary, the person who trashed Sanders' positions, and Trump, the hard choice of racism vs ""I don't want to die homeless and with no health care,"" yeah, people picked Trump over Hillary.  Those same people who were making that choice based on those issues overlap with Sanders, especially now after it's been demonstrated Trump will never deliver on those promises.

I'm sorry if it upsets you to know that you have anything in common with someone who voted for Trump, but you don't get to reject demonstrable facts just because they upset you.  You are not entitled to your own truth, because there's only one truth to be had."

Correction after doing a quick count and seeing it mentioned the spaghetti is 3 layers deep.  This is practically $1k in frozen pasta dinners.  The spaghetti is probably $5 or $6/box, so if each layer is the same amount that's $600 minimum right there, then there's 14 on the bottom for another $70, I know that lasagna costs around $10 each, so another $20 there, a couple large mac n' cheeses is going to be maybe $15 more, I'm betting the smaller ones are $5 each so another $15, and I'm going to say the meatloafs and beefsteak pastas are going to be another $30-$40.  So my estimate, $750 worth of frozen dinners."

Note here how I say ""if?""

So the logical conclusion to draw from that, and my beliefs, is if it's not government backed, there's no reason to be skeptical of it, not start foaming at the mouth and declaring that I must be skeptical of all science.

Also, an impeachment is a charge of a crime, not a verdict of guilt. The point of the Senate trial is to determine guilty or not guilty.  Trying to argue that impeachment means you have to remove no matter what would be like saying that someone charged with a crime has to be declared guilty no matter what."

Well, 1lb of gold would be 1.44 cubic inches... So I'd say those are pretty petite coins if they were pure gold.

As for the rarity, I'd say that gold is significantly more common in the Pathfinder universe, seeing as there's multiple different worlds that it could be collected from and it can also just be magicked into existence.  Wish spells don't exist in our world, after all."
