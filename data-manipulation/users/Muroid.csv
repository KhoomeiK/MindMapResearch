StarWars,ffi3g0v,t1_ffh8b04,1579963965.0,"The sequels have a meandering overarching plot that never knows what it’s really supposed to be doing in any given film, but individually they are all pretty well-executed movies. They suffer most from being in the same franchise as other Star Wars films, especially the other sequel films.

The prequels have a solid and well planned overarching story, but the individual movies are very poorly executed on a lot of levels.

Both trilogies have serious problems. In the end, I like the era, settings and characters (for the most part) that the prequels gave us more than what we got from the sequels, but I have a much easier time watching the sequel films than I do the prequels. Luckily The Clone Wars exists so I can get the prequel content I actually like without having to rewatch those movies."

It portrays a character with a variety of personality traits that are positive in certain situations but dark in others, and as the show goes on, it shows the ways in which Anakin is at risk of slipping into the darkness because of the traits.

It's not a story of someone who gradually has the light worn away and slowly slips into the darkness. It's a story about someone who has great capacity for both good and evil and the various circumstances that could lead him down one path or the other.

He's fiercely loyal, but also deeply hurt by perceived disloyalty from those he cares about. He's intensely patriotic... to the point of having a mild authoritarian streak in his personal politics.

Most liberal or left-leaning news sources (and even other right leaning ones) tend to have a more ideological based position. You can predict what their opinions will be based on the issues while with Fox you can predict what their opinions will be based on how the issue impacts each party.

They’ve also been doing it longer and more blatantly than most and in large part have been a driving force in the overt politicization of the news as other companies try to mimic and keep up with their success in an increasing competitive news landscape.

The material world of our everyday senses doesn’t make any more inherent sense than the world of QM does, we’re just much more familiar with the rules and accept them as basic facts.

Edit: Essentially, intuition isn’t based on a fundamental understanding of the logic of the system and exactly why it behaves the way it does versus behaving some other way. An intuitive understanding of something is based on familiarity with it and the patterns it follows.

As long as something has a system of rules and patterns of behavior, you can get an intuitive understanding of how those patterns operate. This is entirely achievable with QM and most of the frustrations that physicists had with it were wrestling with trying to understand it using an intuition that wasn’t built for dealing with it.

You also seem to be following a weird timeline as far as QM’s development. Leading scientists, including Einstein, were trying to reconcile QM’s results with a classical understanding of physics for pretty much their whole lives.

The problem when dealing with precogs on this level is that you can't always take the \*possible\* outcomes of their actions as evidence of what their intentions are, because for the most part, they know whether those possibilities will actually play out. In this case, they didn't because Fortuna abandoned the Paths that would have resulted in those outcomes.

AskReddit,ff0besn,t1_ff06q5m,1579467206.0,"That’s easy to say but there are a few problems with it:

There are already plenty of people who take that approach with younger people. The problem isn’t *you*. It’s the average person. And you are not necessarily representative of the average person.

Even if you are, what you are describing requires a good deal of self awareness, and how much self awareness you have is inherently difficult to recognize. If you have it, you’ll be right about having it. If you don’t have, you’ll likely think that you do and be wrong. It’s difficult to see what your own blindspots are.

And finally, people do genuinely gain life experience as they age and a lot of people have opinions and beliefs when they are younger that are, frankly, stupid. Distinguishing between the complaints that sound wrong to you because the complainer is young and dumb from the ones that sound wrong because the world has dramatically changed in ways you didn’t notice is non-trivial.

It’s easier to see from the “world has changed” side, but from the side that hasn’t gone job hunting in a long time, it’s very difficult to tell that “I can’t go out and get a job in person because nobody does that” is a valid observation and not just being lazy. It’s literally the opposite of good advice from when they had to deal with the situation with no real intuitive explanation for why that wouldn’t still work well.

The problem with taking the next generation’s word on what they are going through is that most people don’t recognize the solutions to their problems until they have overcome them. If you see someone struggling with the same problem you struggled with, believing the exact same things you believed until you figured it out finally, and they tell you that your advice won’t work, it’s not always going to be easy to believe that they’re right, especially without a solid reason why."

Vacuum is an even better insulator than air and space is basically just a giant “vacuum gap.” 

Space is cold but it takes a very, very long time to cool anything down to that temperature. Even a slight source of heat is going to build up heat in something faster than space is going to allow that heat to be removed in most cases.

My mental images are a bit like the broad view that you get at a glance. You see “everything” without actually registering every detail in your consciousness.

AskReddit,feeszsd,t1_fee3cfr,1579040563.0,"No, you wouldn’t. Those places are a fucking disaster to have to deal with. You’re looking at things from the perspective of “I wish I could get away with things consequence free” and ignoring that a place that lets you do that also let’s everyone else do that, so now you have to figure out how to deal with everyone constantly fucking up and nobody ever finding out in time to fix it properly. 

That’s a recipe for careening from one crisis to the next and absolutely doesn’t make your personal life easier in the long run."

If anything, higher demand is going to *decrease* the value of maintaining extra amenities because you can cut those out and still get bodies in your seats. There’s no reason to offer everybody free food and drinks if you can cut that stuff and still fill your plane."

NoStupidQuestions,fecshs7,t1_fec6ev4,1578982915.0,"This is commonly thought but not exactly the truth. Your brain just gets more efficient at processing things by learning what it does and doesn’t need to pay attention to.

Ever driven a familiar route some many times that you zone out and don’t even remember half the drive? That’s what your brain does to your life in general. It takes the familiar, repetitive parts and it decides it doesn’t need to pay that much attention to them and files them under the broad category of that general experience instead of taking detailed notes.

The older you get, the more things become familiar and the fewer novel experiences you are likely to have. If every day for a month is more or less the same as any other day of the month, you’ll wind up looking back on it and wondering where the time went. Immerse yourself in a totally new experience every day and it’ll seem to go by much slower."
explainlikeimfive,fecs7kd,t1_fechpkg,1578982612.0,"A star is like a faucet and the light is the water. When you turn the faucet on, it takes a fraction of a second for the water that first comes out of the faucet to hit the sink below. Then you have a steady stream going. If you turn the faucet off, it takes the same fraction of a second before the last of the water out of the faucet hits the sink.

Light behaves the same way. It takes time to travel, so whatever you are seeing right now, it’s an image made up of light that was released or reflected some time in the past. For anything on everyday Earth-scales, there is such a tiny, tiny delay between light leaving an object and hitting your eye that it might as well be instantaneous. The delay is basically a rounding error in the time it takes your brain to process the image.

Distances in space, though, are much larger. Within the solar system, it can take minutes or even hours for light to travel from one place to another. Expand that to our galaxy and it becomes years, centuries or millennia. Expand it to the rest of the universe and it becomes millions or billions or years.

So everything we see in space is on a delay depending on how far away it is. Because you don’t really “see” the object itself. You see the pattern of light that is created when it is reflected or emitted by the object. And that takes time to reach you."
