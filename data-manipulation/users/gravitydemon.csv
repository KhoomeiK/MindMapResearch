AskReddit,fdlsdfn,t3_elssvy,1578531357.0,"I thought it was disrespectful to breathe in front of dead people because they can't breathe, so as my school bus passed a grave yard I HAD to hold my breathe. I don't know what I was thinking, but I finally stopped doing it when I reached middle school. It was real good practice before summer though, I remember I could hold my breathe for a while when swimming."
panicdisorder,fdlrzo8,t3_em0zhq,1578531097.0,"I know for a fact that everyone reacts differently with panic episodes. My mom has panic attacks all the time and i do as well. I'm grateful I have her to teavh me how to get through them. I'll tell you now, even sites that seem to have a professional understanding of panic attacks, actually don't. I believe you can only understand if you've experienced it before. For me, and my mom, and almost anyone else I know that has had a panic attack, cried during or after. The episodes can last for hours or just a few minutes. I can't diagnose, but having one panic attack weekly my therapist right away diagnosed me with panic disorder. It is different for everyone and I suggest talkin to someone who has experience with it and has tricks and breathing techniques or something to get through it."

SuicideWatch,fdds3qx,t1_fddr8bq,1578322538.0,"I've been to my new therapist once and I think I will stick with her. It is a struggle to really find someone to talk to, like my last therapist was on cocaine and was fired. I decided to tell my new therapist everything because I decided to give up on giving up. I still have that last strand of hope in me."
