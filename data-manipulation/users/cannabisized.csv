Petrans went to heaven because of their devotion. the town though all went to hell for attempting to peek into heaven before their time so when they returned they all had images of hell to recount. the children too were all consumed by some force except claudius who was consumed by the black entity who probably knew those kids were all going back to earth. so what better way to defeat god than to plant those seeds of doubt saying God is dead making others quesiton their faith if the end result will be hell regardless of how they act. the first person the kids converted was the priest doing the writing. then they left town to spread the message to the world.

MorbidReality,fdzcjqq,t1_fdwcfae,1578788927.0,you keep alluding to lights as if they show up on radar. nobody was looking through sights aiming a SAM. it was all done with a targeting system that picked up a sudden signature when they weren't expecting one (because the plane was delayed an hour before its flight putting it in the air when nothing was expected in that airspace)
MorbidReality,fdzbbhr,t1_fdz3dtc,1578788475.0,congrats on your insite. my comment was to someone saying the person shooting the sam could have looked at the plane and seen in broad daylight it was a plane which is why I made the distinction. read through the rest of the comments see my full understand and thoughts on the issue. according to the  head of the Iranian Guard Air Defense they couldnt tell the difference in the short time they had to make that decision. maybe their radar is different than the systems you're used to. maybe hes fucking lying.
MorbidReality,fdyzjg8,t1_fdypxdm,1578785187.0,yea I meant visually identify it which is clear further down the chain. they were relying on radar and someone freaked and called it in as soon as it appeared. such pedantic fucks cant get over a single wording mistake
bestof,fdxbixt,t1_fdx3jiv,1578767201.0,you're only reading the comments and haven't even read the post to see he mentions the blind spot in the radar due to terrain
MorbidReality,fdxajqj,t1_fdwux6v,1578766899.0,"here is a post that is more in depth about it all. it has recieved gold and gems in r/bestof for what it's worth

>>Wasn't this airplane taking off from Iran? If they suspected it to be a US military plane, why would it be taking off from an public international airport and reporting a commercial flight ID? Wouldn't they be looking for incoming aircraft? It sounds and awful like they are just shooting at anything that moves.

>It is a fabulously egregious failure on the part of Iranian ADA no matter how you spin it. 

>In their defense (ugh) there are some things that could contribute towards how that missile got launched. 

>First, you need to understand what the profile of a 5th gen platform looks like to a Russian built radar system, and then incorporate the immediate context. 

>""Stealth"" airplanes, even the best ones the United States can build, are still detectable from various angles and at a close enough distance. For instance, an F-35 relies on internal carriage to store its weapons, which greatly reduces its radar profile. When it's time to attack something, it has to kick its bay doors open long enough to drop or fire the ordnance it's carrying. When those doors are open, its signature increases substantially. This is a golden window for a competent air defense guy to lock and fire on the airplane. Unfortunately for them that window is very short, and by the time the missile is off the rail the airplane is likely back in an LO configuration, maneuvering, and not emitting. Given the system that supposedly launched on the airliner, that's about as far as you can get. 

>American doctrine and tech also rely heavily on EW. That is, the ability to play with the enemy's sensors. Jamming, spoofing, and manipulating their systems to influence where they're focused.

>While the systems are classified, everybody has a decent idea about them, and incorporates that ability into their threat assessments.

>Now, imagine you are a well trained weapons systems operator of a domestic SAM site briefed on adversary platforms and notional threat profiles. You are manning a missile site during the most heightened threat posture your nation has ever known since you were born, against the most capable adversary on the planet. You know that if you ever even have the chance to launch on an enemy airplane, it will be fleeting and transient. 

>You know you are subject to systems that can throw radar returns at you that do not exist, that are somewhere else, that look like one thing, but are another. Iran knows the US can do this. They train for it.

>Now, a fresh return pops up already airborne, climbing out at ~6,000 feet, out of nowhere. 

>There's terrain between you and the airport (which could and did obscure the path the airliner took from the runway to ~6,000 feet), but you already have a flight schedule and you know nothing is scheduled to depart that airport in a one hour window (true.)

>The Iranian military is somewhat competent. More so than the Arab militaries in the region. While it's not equivalent to the West, there is some expectation that initiative is a good thing. 

>So you have a radar return out of no where, with no civilian airplanes expected in the area, during a period of extreme threat, with the educated assumption that a sudden radar return headed straight for a strategic asset represents a plausible threat profile, and you fire."
MorbidReality,fdx00v5,t1_fdwux6v,1578763933.0,it tells me they really wanted to cover their ass after this massive blunder. I think they were really trying to paint themselves on the world stage as being the victims is this whole situation to gain support but then fucked up and shot a plane down ruining their entire image as the non-aggressors. its obvious you want to see this as a malicious act and that's fine I guess. I personally think it was a major fuck up during a very tense moment. I think Iran should have to make some kind of reparations for the event but I dont think they should be vilified to justify more military actions against them.

I never made that point. in fact I made the point against it being seen in the sky at the time. I think a blip appeared on their radar when they weren't expecting a blip and their hair trigger reaction lead to the plane being shot down. i dont think they had any visual confirmation of what it was or wasn't."

MorbidReality,fdvwmal,t1_fdvvyyi,1578752501.0,the response said at that altitude you can clearly see and identify it implying anyone looking would have clearly seen it was a passenger airline without the use of radar or other tracking devices. my point was that you couldnt visually see the plane at night so they would have had to rely on their identifying equipment at that time. the truth will only be known by the person who pressed the button about why they did it.
MorbidReality,fdvvkxw,t1_fdvqti5,1578752029.0,I read the fought had also been delayed over an hour before take off so there is a chance that this plane wasnt expected in that area at that time. and if stealth bombers are as stealthy as they claim it is plausible that an aircraft showing up on their radar when they arent expecting planes sent them to high alert and the button was pressed before anyone realized what was happening
MorbidReality,fdvv1l4,t1_fdvt7v9,1578751763.0,it was night time in Tehran when the plane was shot down. just saying the ability to identify it clearly didnt exist because there was no daylight at the time.

politics,fdsiy5w,t1_fdsh6za,1578703641.0,"i just want to preface this comment by saying I dont subscribe to these beliefs but I do think they are being sowed by some publications. I think ""Iranians"" has become synonymous with ""terrorists"" for some people. so saying the people were Canadian gives the impression of them being innocent bystanders but saying they're Iranians makes it somehow seem like they deserved it because ""Iranian = Terrorist"". so the dual citizenship distinction is being made to be able so say they were some part iranian and therefore associsted with terrorist and thus they deserved it.
