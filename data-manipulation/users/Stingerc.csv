Back in the 70’s this little upstart called Southwest tried to get the local government to also let it be their hub in the Rio Grand Valley, but they said no because we had Pan Am, so it would be embarrassing having a budget airline have to share with the world’s most important one. 

Eventually Pan Am went bust, our airport went into disuse, eventually even closing for a while.  We’re still the biggest city in the area, but our airport is the smallest.  The two cities in the valley that did allow Southwest to operate now have far bigger and busier airports, despite the fact that our airport is historical landmark and was basically America’s hub to South America for more than 50 years.  Even today because of this it’s still the main immigration point of entry for private flights coming in from south and Central America.   A friend used to work at coffee shop at that airport and he has a ton of pictures with celebrities who had to wait around the airport while their private flights cleared customs (they usually looked annoyed as fuck having to wait around in a little airport with nothing but a coffee shop for 3 or 4

WTF,ff3bmf8,t1_ff38c2i,1579537980.0,"Sadly you are right.   Even with good insurance you can still get fucked.  A few years back my exes mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.   She’s a worrywart with disease, specially since her dad had died young of a brain tumor, so her health package offered an upgrade cancer package.   She asked me to ask my dad if it was a good idea.

My dad is an oncologist and had told her the cancer her father got was rare and related to exposure to certain chemicals because of his line of work, but if she could afford it she should as there was that precedent in her family. It came out to about an extra thousand dollars a years, thankfully the insurance she got at work was very good so it was basically the only upgrade she paid.  

When she was diagnosed and started treatment it really paid off, close to 40 or 50 grand, covering mostly incidentals in treatment.   We were in a small city in Texas and she got her treatment at MD Anderson in Houston.   This basically paid for the weekly six hour trip to Houston, lodging for the 3 to 4 days she stayed there, and other things.  Even with all this, she ended up spending close to 20 grand out of pocket when it was all said and done and she thankfully got a clean bill of health and has been cancer free for close to a decade now.

Again, this is a person with good insurance and who through sheer worry was spending over a grand a year in extra insurance, she still ended up having to spend close to two years to paying off the debt for her treatment.   I can’t imagine what it’s like for someone with very basic insurance living paycheck to paycheck.   Getting sick in the US has become an expressway to poverty."

To be honest, it works in Liga MX because the league has a long history of being the testing ground for new technologies.  This was due to the fact Guillermo Cañedo, who for years to was FIFA'S VP technology and development was also the president of Club America and the VP for sports programming for Televisa, Latin America's biggest TV network.  With this he had huge influence within the Mexican league and complete control of how games were broadcast.

Tons of members of the roya family do this, not all get a salary out of it.  Some like cousins of the queen usually just got to live rent free in Crown owned properties in exchange of these services.  That changed a few years ago when people started complaining they were living off people's taxes.  So now they live in crown owned properties paying ridiculously low rents (remember reading someone was paying 6 pounds a month for a huge apartment) in exchange for being representatives of the crown. 

Harry and Megan were a bit different. They got housing, a very large stipend, and security in exchange of their duties."

ChoosingBeggars,fdwpn92,t1_fdofxcl,1578761163.0,"well, it's also a different situation.  Au pairs are supposed to be young girls, usually college or gap year age, who go into these programs that place them with a host family in another country.  They provide some child care, usually during the week, in exchange for lodging, food, and a stipend.   They then get weekends off to experience the country.   

It's a very common thing in most of europe.  Again, it's usually not girls looking for a permanent job or a way to emigrate.  They're girls looking to live a year or two abroad."
ChoosingBeggars,fdwontw,t1_fdmf0xe,1578760905.0,"but that's different than an au pair.  You are a professional doing your job,  au pairs are gap year girls, usually from well to do countries, looking for an experience by moving with a family in another country and helping with their kids in exchange of food, lodging, and a small stipend.  In some countries like the US, it also requires a special type of visa.   

Again, not saying that childcare givers should not be paid their just due, but an au pair is not a professional in any way of form.  It's usually a college or gap year girl who takes cares of the kids during the week then fucks off during the weekends to do stuff with her friends.   At least that's what i remember from au pairs i met when i lived in Spain."

The smartest person I know, my thesis adviser in colleges.  Had a PhD in history, was a fulbright scholar, and fucking walking encyclopedia told me something that's always stuck with me: People with no formal education have a really hard time discerning legitimate sources from false ones.   Even worse, they have a strong bias towards the ones that support something they believe and will ignore ones that contradict them despite having strong evidence of being right. 

The rise of the internet has made this a bigger problem because now you can find a thousand other idiots who believe the same nonsense as you and validate that belief.  

The Joe Rogan Podcast is a perfect example of this.  The man peddles some of the most ignorant bullshit out there and the people who follow him take it as gospel."

Otra opción es abrir una cuenta de nómina que te da los mismos beneficios que la digital.

It's almost 30 years and we are now seeing a very severe backlash against the catholic church in Ireland.  The vote to repeal the abortion ban is a good example of it, passing with over 70% of the vote in favor of ending the ban. 

It was fucking hilarious seeing all the idiot American evangelical Christians and conservatives catholics go over to supposedly be part of Ireland reaffirming their tradition of strong, religious people saying no to abortion only to be met by people telling them to fuck off and reporting them for illegal entering the country to try to influence an election.  It was glorious seeing them cry and bitch about how Ireland had lost its way and say incredibly ridiculous shit like how the US was now more ""Irish"" than Ireland."
