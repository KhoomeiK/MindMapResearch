I don't think it's asinine at all, what Justin did was the same thing if you minus out it being in a film. There was literally outrage that he even painted his face, that's what Joe is saying. If anything is asinine, it's the reaction to something meant to be taken in jest, but many have lost their humor (believing everything to be a personal attack) replacing it with indignation and TBH it's such a fucking shame. You can watch some real laugh out loud stuff from the 80's 90's and early 2000's that pokes fun at people but comes from the heart with the simple desire for humor and if people laugh, is that not the very definition of humor? No fan of this outrage culture that's been fostered, the world is NOT a better place for it."
