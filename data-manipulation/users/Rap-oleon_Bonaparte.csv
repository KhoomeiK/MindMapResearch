Its a confusing post ... I agree wedding parties dont really matter and the decision to cancel and do you own thing is totally fine and justifiable normally, but how you get there is a bit weird... it does read like a tantrum, but also a tantrum where seemingly only you get hurt, so... fine?

Im assuming the big wedding you want if your idea and your husband is ok with a smaller/destination wedding if hes suggesting it, if he was upset/losing out here too then I would say you are TA.

Its always fine to do your own thing for a wedding as long as you and your spouse are happy, and in this case your motivation for that is seemingly spite but I still think that holds true"

Yes, yank customs are harsh with all foreigners not the Brits specifically I assume. Im not sure thats a plus tho.

Ime Britain is the least racist place in Europe, but that still sadly means a pretty constant low level of racism you have to deal with all the time. But I havent run into people in full SS uniforms at the pub or dealt with skinhead gangs chanting slurs at us etc, so something to be thankful for I guess."

Most places will offer to do that for you, but they will add a surcharge for the effort. So the cheapest way is... go to the post office. Or hotels can arrange it all for you, if you are staying in one."

Scotland and England are two different countries, both are in Britain, which is part of the UK. Its very complicated and nobody really cares, but if you insist one person identify or refer to themselves as one specific title you are probably up to something or probbo and should be minding your own business."

I mean your internal narrative is all over the place but you present a conversation where a drunk person just talks at you rudely and you sound mildly annoyed. Of course you arent the asshole.

You do have a lot of stereotypes and problematic stuff in your narrative here, but nothing in the story itself.

Lots of English dont like being called British too, her description of England sounds the opposite of how anyone ever describes it and so does yours. And saying ""proud to be scottish/english"" whatever can often just be dogwhistley nationalist nonsense so thats best ignored on all sides."

Its fine to want that and for her to want her thing... but its something you need to discuss obviously and agree together, and theres a load of middle grounds. And im not sure taking some time out is the career killer you seem to think it is.

She could do something low key or volunteer to keep an active CV if thats the only concern, or keep a pt role if a little extra revenue is the goal, you just need to be on the same page about the risk of whatever your profession is and what your life now vs financial goals should break down as... 

Its rare you cant sort these things out, but its common they fester when they arent discussed properly."
