Any books I remember being assigned in middle school that weren't written by white males were written by non-white females, so I can't help you."

infp,ffaxq7f,t3_esmi9y,1579746927.0,I'd suggest going to a technical college when you have an idea to do something as far as a career. Two years instead of four and you'd actually be working towards something. You don't wanna get stuck working dead end jobs at minimum wage. It's soul crushing.
depression,fesmzv8,t1_ferpad1,1579366957.0,"The founder of To Write Love On Her Arms did an AMA this past fall and I asked him what one should do in the event that a parent refuses to listen to their child about mental health and just dismisses them. (I.e. my dad just avoiding the fact that I've had depression my whole life and never doing anything about it.) And he basically said ""that's a tough one. Probably should go see a mental health professional to untangle that."" So yeah, a professional is gonna be able to actually help you make progress. But I think a lot of the people here in these comments just want a tiny bit of empathy. 

I really don't expect my dad to understand what depression is like. But he never even tried to listen. He just shrugged it off as nothing because yeah, he's not equipped to deal with it. But instead of maybe having me see a professional who is equipped, he just ignored it. And when you're a minor (in America, i dunno how it is in the rest of the world) in that situation, you're kinda stuck.

So yeah, there comes a point where you should seek out a professional if you're able to. (Therapy is expensive here). They'll be able to actually help you make sense of your brain. But having someone in your life (friends, family, etc) that tells you ""i don't get this at all, but i care and am here to listen"" can help tremendously. And sadly, it doesn't seem like that's the common response when someone opens up about mental health."
depression,feshl85,t3_eqcju4,1579365239.0,"I grew up in a house where people get shitty with you if you're not happy. My dad is quick to start screaming even if I need help with something pretty mundane. (I've seen him scream at my little sister over not being able to understand her honework way too many times. I ain't asking for help of any kind.) So I had to learn to act like I'm okay. So now when my dad tries to legitimately talk to me, I can't tell him how I truly feel. I've tried telling him a few times over the past, i dunno, 10-ish years that I have depression and everytime he says ""no you don't"" and ""get over yourself."" And he has such a dominating personality and I'm so timid that I can't get my thoughts together quick enough to try and explain to him what's going on. So our conversations just end up with him scolding me while I nod my head.. I'm 26 and our relationship is still like this.

And he wonders why I can't talk to him about anything."
tipofmytongue,fe014ye,t3_enibqj,1578800515.0,I really don't know what else to say. I tried an app that lets you hum a melody and it'll tell you the song but it's giving me nothing.
Anxiety,fdxharj,t3_en7g7v,1578768715.0,"I literally had to message my boyfriend yesterday while I was at work that if he needed to vent about his day, he should do it now over text because that's less exhausting than having to physically listen to it. I just did not have the energy left."
depression,fdxfnwx,t3_enaeze,1578768270.0,"I don't know. Sometimes a change can briefly help. I always feel better after a haircut. And changes to hair are temporary (well, pretty temporary when compared to tattoos or piercings, please don't get those on a whim) so, honestly, go for it. Short hair is the best anyway."
depression,fdxe74j,t3_enap3g,1578767876.0,"This has always been one of the more frustrating consequences of depression for me. At first, I thought I was just tired and drinking a bunch of coffee will help. Yeah, it didn't help. Probably made it worse, actually.

I'd pay attention to external factors that might make your brain fog worse. Like just notice that you're in a deep fog and look around and see where you're at. Sounds. Lights. Smells. Outside or inside. Etc etc. 

Certain types of lighting will fuck with me. Like harsh department store fluorescent lights and some classrooms that use similar lighting. It's weird and I don't get why it does that, but my brain just shuts off like it's being overstimulated when all I could be doing is grabbing a gallon of milk or sitting in class. 

That and droning noises from machines also mess with me. I recently was waiting for pizza takeout and the restaurant had both that harsh lighting and all their fridges, ovens, machines, whatever made constant loud droning sounds. This was a pretty small building, too, which made the sounds worse. It was overstimulating like crazy. I was either gonna have a panic attack or my brain was gonna shut down into a foggy dissociative state. I had to leave my boyfriend inside to pick up our order while I waited in the car. 

But just knowing that something externally is messing with me helps calm my anxiety because I know that once I'm away from there for a while, I'll start to feel a little more like myself."
Anxiety,fdonf5r,t3_emh03f,1578608710.0,"You're not overreacting. It's your body, your choice, and your life. You don't owe anyone kids or grandkids. Your dad's friend's son having kids literally has nothing to do with you. 

Also, if your parents are in their 60s and you're 24, that means they were ~40 when they had you. I'm sensing a tiny bit of hypocrisy unless my math is wrong."
