One time should do and you can use Revolution (prescription only) if that makes you feel better later. It protects against worms as well as fleas/ticks and that’s what we use on our cats (note it is not cheap). You can find huge cat towers on Chewy pretty cheap. Our cats like theirs and play on it constantly. We also have window perches (that heat) for them so they can sit and enjoy the sun and watch the birds.. they will spend hours there. We also have cat tunnels (from Amazon, about $15) running behind/beside our sofas and they love that. 

Buy them a water fountain from somewhere like Walmart for $19. This is essential, IMO, as cats are known to live in a state of near constant dehydration which causes kidney issues later. Our cats have had a fountain the whole time and they drink a ton of water. 

A wand toy is good and our cats love the catnip stuffed mice from Walmart. They also have a turbo scratcher, scratch posts in most rooms. They have never broken anything. 

As I type this I realize my cats are spoiled AF"

cats,ffof18h,t3_euduov,1580077000.0,"Because they’re assholes. 




Jk - I mean, that’s true. But like posted above it’s the small space that makes them feel safe from predators."

LGBDropTheT,ffmw6eg,t1_ffmsusb,1580059578.0,It’s disgusting. You should disclose it just as you should disclose if you’re married. No one has the right to trick anyone into intimacy for any reason.
LGBDropTheT,ffmpkyl,t3_eu8k5k,1580057594.0,Are these people trolls? Are we sure they are real? I can’t fathom a world like this. This kind of thing should be illegal. A potential romantic partner has every right to know anything relevant like this.
cats,ffjq0ol,t3_etzqnk,1580004038.0,No cat is unadoptable.
cats,ffj924r,t3_etwhnb,1579993320.0,"Definitely let them know. I recently had a woman knock on my door after seeing one of our cats in the window. She was convinced it was her lost cat. I showed her that our cat was much too young to be hers, and she was sad. She told me that she hoped he came back, but that if not it would make her happy to know he had a good home."
cats,ffj6ceu,t3_etxrjm,1579991516.0,"Not Serval or Bengal.. not fully, anyway. He has a coat that is similar, but he looks like a common DSH with a unique coat."
politics,ffiwefu,t3_etw43f,1579984333.0,This doesn’t fit in with r/politics “Biden is a conservative” narrative.
cats,ffh09u7,t3_etksvz,1579919660.0,"No no no no no no. The feeding instructions are on the cans, did you not look there? I don’t have any 5.5oz cans handy, but my 3oz cans instruct 3 cans per 5-9lbs of body weight. So your cats almost certainly need at least DOUBLE what you are giving them. How long has this food shortage been going on?"
