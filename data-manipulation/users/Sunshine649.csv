facepalm,felam19,t1_fel667a,1579217708.0,"Because we teach our Soldiers everything they need to know after they come in. And we never stop teaching them till they ETS. 

It doesn’t have to make sense to you, I was just trying to correct your false statement. It’s really inconsequential if you believe me or not.

If you truly want to know more, I’m more than willing to elaborate."
facepalm,feksyl9,t1_feksl6t,1579206958.0,"Great, civilian test for civilians to enter the army uses the only unit that they are familiar with. 

Been in the Army for 13 years now, we most definitely use metric system for everything in the Army."
facepalm,fek3s5x,t1_fejrja8,1579191998.0,No we do not.

cringepics,fea6bv8,t1_fea3qz9,1578944860.0,"You honestly think we have ground forces deployed in Iran?

Even if we did, it would be a huge OPSEC violation to be going around telling people that.

And no, I just think you have no idea what you’re talking about."
cringepics,fea2kut,t1_fe95vv2,1578943753.0,"Just want to say we never moved any troops to Iran. I keep seeing people saying this for some reason.

There is a difference between “We moved troops to Iraq to protect against a possible attack from Iran.” And “We’ve moved troops to Iran.”"

OldSchoolCool,fd4xwge,t1_fd4osit,1578172193.0,"[Several bases were attacked via rockets](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/02/photos-reveal-damage-to-us-embassy-in-baghdad-following-attack-by-supporters-of-iran-backed-militia/) by this militia. And it was not a protest, they stormed the front gate and tried to burn the embassy to the ground, though they only succeeded in burning the reception center before the Marine garrison repelled them. This militia groups commander, trained by General Soleimani even set up a command post outside the us embassy. And we learned that Iran/ and this militia group were making plans to storm the embassy and take the US diplomats/ cadre hostage. (Iran hostage crisis boogaloo 2?)

That being said, I think it was incredibly irresponsible to assassinate a sovereign nations general. But he was a piece of shit that needed to go so I’m a bit torn between the good and bad."
news,fcz1sz4,t1_fcz0ovv,1578091952.0,"Yeah I know, it’s pretty fucked up too, but that’s only happened a hand full of times. But what I said stands, we, in the military take war crimes VERY seriously and conduct legitimate trials on those who would violate LOW (Laws of War). 

We train our men and women extensively on these laws so there is no excuse for these crimes. I have had the unfortunate experience of being at one of these trials (PFC Green). And he got what he deserved. But justice being served doesn’t make for a good headline."
news,fcyxqut,t1_fcywhfq,1578089403.0,"We do, and we take it very seriously, even though social media would have you think otherwise. We send our soldiers to trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But we do not allow host nations to try our troops in accordance with SOFA (Statute Of Forces Agreements) otherwise it would be impossible to conduct operations in those countries."
