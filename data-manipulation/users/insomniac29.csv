DesignMyRoom,fgv3cue,t1_fgss5lw,1581135968.0,Can’t one tv do both? Or different people want to do different things at the same time?
AmItheAsshole,fgv235f,t1_fgv1tss,1581134965.0,"People can imagine something being great but then once they see it in person, or notice how it sticks out and catches on things or whatever they realize it wasn’t ideal. I don’t think you should take it personally. You got what she asked for so she has no reason to blame you, if she wants to change it that’s her choice. It will still be the diamond you paid for and proposed with."
AmItheAsshole,fgv1q9l,t1_fguna51,1581134692.0,"What if she pays to put the diamond onto a new setting? Are you mad that she wants you to spend more money, or mad that she wants to change something you worked hard on? She has to wear it the rest of her life, so you should let her change it if she’s paying."
Celiac,fguxxgc,t3_f0h4w6,1581131948.0,"Wowww, so glad it wasn’t shingles. Apparently if you get it on both sides it’s pretty lethal."
Celiac,fguthy2,t1_fguq6c8,1581129077.0,"Yeah, I went GF right after the blood test at my GP because they didn’t explain anything to me, then it got drawn out because I had to to a gluten challenge after talking to the gastroenterologist. I will say the challenge helped convince me I had it though, because I was eating sooo much and felt so much worse than I had the month before."
AmItheAsshole,fgtyhls,t1_fgtlovd,1581111010.0,"Yeah does he feel rejected and depressed every time his step mom closes the bathroom door to shave her legs? The husband is being ridiculous. My guess is the dad feels guilty for divorcing his sons mom and starting a new family, which could be hard on a kid if any age, but he needs to deal with that and make his son feel important himself. Not just dump on his wife who is really struggling and in pain with a bizarre request that won’t help his son anyways."
AmItheAsshole,fgtiyx2,t1_fgt3vpv,1581105079.0,Yeah a 13 year old should already know that without being told. I mean most people wouldn't feel embarrassed about a 3 year old seeing them naked if they accidentally wandered in and the husband's request for the wife to patiently explain breastfeeding would make more sense there. A teenager of the opposite sex seeing you in a naked vulnerable state and leering is obviously upsetting for a lot of people.
AmItheAsshole,fgtiav6,t1_fgt2z61,1581104877.0,"As I said in many comments there should be an allowance for the girls to have privacy by having a small canvas bag to carry menstrual supplies. If there isn't the parents need to demand an accommodation from the principle. Another solution would be free pad and tampon dispensers in every girls bathroom. If there is bullying that also needs to be addressed by the school administration. It should be the bullies taken out of school in suspension, not their victims."
NYCapartments,fgt1k18,t3_f0cl1h,1581097113.0,Do you have a guarantor?
DesignMyRoom,fgssail,t1_fgsqjn1,1581091593.0,so it's your studio apartment?
AmItheAsshole,fgsrtjc,t3_f09w7t,1581091303.0,"NTA, I know people who have done IVF and it's rare that the doctor will thaw one egg, it will get fertilized and survive implantation. They normally thaw and try to fertilize several, and implant at least two depending on your personal situation and risk factors. So giving her one egg won't help her at all, it will only reduce your own chances if you need them in the future. I don't know if you could even convince a fertility specialist to attempt the process with a single egg. Since the survival of frozen eggs is so low many people are disappointed to learn that they went through all that cost and effort only for it to completely fail later on. Freezing embryos has a higher success rate, but normally people freeze eggs because they don't have a partner yet. I'm sorry she's in this situation, but you're not really in a position to help her. Hopefully having her get better educated will help prevent her from blaming you for her struggles."
NYCapartments,fgsqwl1,t3_f0b7hm,1581090741.0,"Unless you have separate leases for your rooms the landlord doesn't care if each roommate makes 40x the rent of their room, they care if all the roommates combined make 40x the rent of the whole apartment. So if the remaining roommates make a little more it can even out. I wouldn't pick someone with bad credit though, I took in a subletter with bad credit in the past who claimed she had really good reasons for it, her salary was high, but she was routinely late on rent or had checks bounce. If you're staying on the lease you're legally responsible for them paying their rent and any damage they might cause, so you want someone as trustworthy as possible. Is it an option to get them to replace you on the lease? There might be a fee, but it would be worth the peace of mind if it's an option. I would definitely not sneak someone in there that the landlord doesn't know about. That's probably a lease violation (check your lease). They probably wouldn't find out or care, but why risk it?"
dogswithjobs,fgsff6i,t1_fgs8192,1581082845.0,"Aww, he's your dog? What a good boy! I can't even get mine to stop eating sidewalk garbage.."
dogswithjobs,fgsfc53,t1_fgrzqrv,1581082779.0,"I know, I wish I could bring my dog with me even just to do something really fast, but it would be way too dangerous. I know several professors here that bring their dogs in and then make their staff watch them."
AmItheAsshole,fgrhty8,t1_fgqm3vb,1581047174.0,"I don’t think she needs to subject herself to something she finds humiliating all for the cause of destigmatizing breast feeding. I’m not saying there’s something wrong with it that all people should feel embarrassed about but if she does that’s all that matters. It’s also the way that the boy stares and makes grossed out faces that’s upsetting her, the boy needs his father to teach him basic manners and respect."
AmItheAsshole,fgrh30n,t1_fgr3djm,1581046649.0,Yeah also a 13 year old is clearly going through puberty and not really the child her husband claims he is. If this was a three year old child asking innocent questions it would be a different story.
AmItheAsshole,fgrgd62,t1_fgrce2i,1581046141.0,"Maybe, but I doubt it, she’ll probably make it all about herself still."
AmItheAsshole,fgra39q,t1_fgqg7l6,1581041818.0,"As someone with celiac thank you for being considerate! I hate having to be a burden, when someone goes out of their way to call a place and ask about the gluten free options it’s amazing."
