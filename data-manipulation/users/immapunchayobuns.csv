Wheatens,ffa7ye4,t3_eshllj,1579729639.0,"I have a 9 year old wheaten terrier, Cody, who I've had since he was a puppy. He is just WONDERFUL with children and seniors alike. He somehow knew not to jump on my grandmother when she visited, and loves attention. He's patient and very sweet. Everyone who's lived with him (including housemates) or met him love him! My mom used to have tons of people over at one time, and the kids would crowd onto his bed and pet him. He was in heaven!

Wheatens do tend to jump and be boisterous (the wheaten greetin'), so start the jump training asap! I taught him to ""wait"", which applies to anything (eating, feet wiping after a walk, etc), but for greetings, I make him sit until I'm ready and I go in for a hug while saying ""okay!"" and he gets to jump on me then. Cody is very smart and will definitely test the limits. He's also sensitive and will get very sad and mopey if he gets scolded.

Cody is suuuper clingy. He's alright home alone, but can get anxious if you come and go within a short amount of time (might be just him though). It will be hard for your puppy to be alone for about 8 hours (so during this time a walker might be good!). They're pretty high energy but mostly able to turn it on and off. Cody's super lazy indoors and will just nap. When it's playtime, he's super into it, and LOVES sprinting outside. The terrier stubbornness is real haha. Sometimes it'll turn into a staring contest until he obeys. It can be hard to get him back inside in the wintertime especially, it seems like all wheatens love snow.

Grooming and brushing is really important because the fur is so thick. I like to have his ears shaved which is the usual wheaten style, and then one length everywhere else, with the private areas shorter. Also, speaking of snow, Cody will get clumps of snow in his fur and look like he's covered in fleece! Hilarious but will take a while to get out -- and even then you can expect drips everywhere. He definitely carries nature inside the house, thanks to his fur. I've found bugs that have died in there LOL.

In summary, I'd say that wheatens are excellent family dogs, able to go from gentle and snoozy to zoomies and jumping. Mine doesn't bark very often, just when someone's at the door or we're playing chase and hiding from him. When he was young someone asked if he knew how to bark. He's very loving with everyone and lovable. Very much fun-loving and happy-go-lucky in general. He still gets questioned on whether he's a puppy despite being an old fogey at 9.

In terms of anxiety as well, since he has always been pretty sensitive, I actually started giving him CBD treats made by Mojo in british columbia, canada. So far it's the only brand that has made an impact."
