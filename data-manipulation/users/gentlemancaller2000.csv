Youâ€™re tossing everyone into the same category, when whatâ€™s really going on is that the media is reporting opinions from different groups at different times.  You have to understand the context:  Hardline Republicans have always hated them both, and hardline Dems have always loved them.  But in the primary season (now), the same-party candidates are trashing each other trying to win the party nomination, so you are seeing stories about Dems that like or dislike one Democratic candidate over the other, and it tends to get heated.  Looks like Hillary is sitting this one out, so sheâ€™s taking shots at Bernie, which makes her look bad.

Not so much the blockchain encryption system, but the phenomenon itself - how can what amounts to a collection of unique numbers have such value?  I understand the principle behind currencies that are backed by â€œthe good faith and creditâ€ of a government (as opposed to gold).   I get that there is a psychological aspect to maintaining faith in a currency and once that faith is lost, a currency can collapse.   I just donâ€™t understand why anyone would have that much faith in bitcoin,  it seems the allure simply an anonymous currency not controlled by a government nor traceable by law enforcement.

My point is that there are some things that are worth researching that donâ€™t show the sort of low risk path to profitability that would entice typical corporate investment, but ultimately could be very important.   Examples might include vaccines for relatively rare but potentially dangerous diseases (Ebola, maybe?), or space travel, which is a case where the merits can be debated, but the resulting technological advances are hugely beneficial.   Imagine if you had to pay a fee every time you used a GPS device.  If industry had funded GPS development, it might not be free and open for all.  But in the 1950â€™s and 1960â€™s it was clearly a technology that was too risky for any corporation to invest in."

Large corporations who spend money on research do so only when there is a high likelihood of creating a profitable product, process, or service that they own and control.  They tend to stay away pure, basic research for the sake of knowledge or for technology very far removed from commercialization, because there is a low probability of payback.  Thatâ€™s why government funded research is important.

US: â€œWe can do that.  However, we donâ€™t want our people or allies attacked at home or abroad.  No more hijackings, suicide bombings, or attacks of any kind on our land, embassies, or legitimate business interests, anywhere.  Weâ€™d much rather establish a robust economic relationship and make everyoneâ€™s lives better.â€ 
Them: â€œGreat!  But what if some fanatical terrorist group attacks you, and we canâ€™t control them?â€
US: â€œFigure our how to control them or we will come back to help.â€
Them â€œDonâ€™t come back!!!  Weâ€™ll deal with the terrorists.  You have our word.â€
US: â€œPerfect.  Weâ€™ll go home now.  You guys want to go out for a beer or something?â€"
