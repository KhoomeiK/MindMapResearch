ZeroWaste,feiwexu,t1_feiu9ax,1579149054.0,"Thanks for pointing this out. I frequently see the argument of not having a kid for the sake of the environment but I don’t agree with the logic. Disclaimer though, I have no sources to cite for what I’m about to say, and this is all just my point of view. 

The concept of zero waste should focus on shifting your mindset to be less wasteful. Yes, this should include significant sacrifices like eating a plant-heavy diet and buying less new stuff even if these things inconvenience you. 

What zero waste should not be about is making sacrifices that change your life entirely. For instance, there are people who find purpose in raising children. Are you going to tell those people to not have children? In the same way, would you tell someone not to pursue their dream job just because their dream job is less environmentally friendly than some other job they’d be miserable working at?  

Basically, if you want kids, you should have them. If you want kids but feel bad about the environmental repercussions, then take action to prevent unwanted children from being conceived. Support accessibility to abortions, birth control, and proper sex ed. You can also donate to organizations with the same goal of preventing overpopulation. If you do these things, you would allow for a lot fewer people on this Earth instead of just the one or two you decided not to have"

You say you can get past the HackerRank coding challenge but not the interviews, and you also say that you are lacking in DS&A/Leetcode questions. And maybe you are lacking a little in those kind of interview questions, but how are your interviewing skills themselves?

Because personally, I wasn’t doing great during interviews when I first started looking for new grad positions and it wasn’t because I didn’t have the technical skill required. I would say that I was and I still am not great at Leetcode questions. I can probably get half or most Leetcode mediums, and if I were given a Leetcode hard I probably wouldn’t be able to solve it. But I started doing fine on interviews because I would explain my thought process clearly while at least getting close to the answer. 

What I’m trying to say is that the skill of communication and explaining your thought process clearly is very important in getting the interviewer to know you can be a competent SWE. Again, I’m not sure if it is actually your problem but if it is, then it is important to try and improve on it because what is the point of having technical skills if you can’t demonstrate them to the interviewer"
