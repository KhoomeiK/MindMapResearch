>I disagree with the comparison to a ""business trip"" because this isn't serving a private interest, but the public interest. Usually these people can make a lot more money in the private sector, although these types of positions do help future earnings, so it is kind of a trade off.

>Even if you think it is wrong, you don't see how it would be more comforting that the country would protect you when you make a mistake?

I can see how it would be more comforting, but its almost a false sense of comfort. This isnt breaking some foreign law you might not have been aware of, this is killing another human being. Something illegal across all known countries. 

Imagine a British citizen killing an American soldier in an accident as senseless as driving on the wrong side of the road, having an arrest warrant out for them then they literally flee the country.
