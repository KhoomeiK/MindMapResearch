Get to MS30 if you haven’t already. Toss in a 70% cost reduction manager and level it up with the cash you have. Increase elevator and warehouse to help but don’t focus on it after the initial MS30 upgrade. 

Toss in turner and let him run. Make sure that the miners are all coming in at once before you start him.

When I started at 232 in July of 2019 I just tried to eat less. I dropped to 218 within a month and a half (Aug 18 or so). I'd eat like frozen waffles in the morning, plus a banana. For lunch I'd get a frozen amy's meal or something else from the grocery store plus like a yogurt. I'd eat pasta, burrito, or subway sandwich for dinner and kept the portions low.

This continued after 218, but I was stagnating at around 215 lbs, so I started introducing a little bit of gym into it, doing only cardio for maybe 2-3 days a week. Usually it was just elliptical for 30 minutes or so. That helped push me to 210. Where I sat. For 1 whole month. Not moving beyond 208 or above 213.

I started adding lifting to my workouts but also doing them simultaneously (so lifting first then cardio). This helped push me over to 207. Stagnated there for a bit.

I realized I wasn't consuming enough protein so I started drinking protein shakes in the morning, eating heavier lunches and salads for dinner. Boom this dropped me 203 and beyond. I kept to the gym as best as I could but before I left for Hawaii I was so focused on getting my presentation done that I forwent the gym and just made sure to eat right. I reached my goal of ""under 200 by 2020"" by December 31, at 199.8 lbs.

I was in Hawaii from Jan 3 evening until the 11th afternoon, where I walked... everywhere... The first day I walked 11.5 miles with a buddy. Each day was different, some high, some low, but overall I walked 52 miles in 7-8 days of being there, averaging around 6.5-7 miles a day.

I ate like shit in Hawaii because I was there for conference and enjoying myself, but the heat plus the walking kinda offset that.

And that's basically it, I'm back now and kinda still getting back into the swing of things but the basic thing is just to eat light and ramp up exercises slowly to help keep the body and mind in check."
wholesomebpt,ff3q9mz,t1_ff3p3r0,1579546526.0,"Yep, this is why I don't want to pursue a PhD. There is such a thing as a postdocalypse happening. We have a new hire coming into our team that's done 3 postdocs already and will be entering a position either lower than me or at the same level as me but I'm 100% sure his starting salary is going to be less than mine...

I know it's not about the money and for me it's always about my career and the love and passion I have for my field but in reality you need to make ends meet, and especially if you have familial obligations/are a caretaker (such as in my situation) having a decent income means a lot more than having a fancy title next to my name.

I don't want to have to stress about being penniless (essentially) for another 6 years when I could use that time to boost my career. I've been in my job for 5 years and in that time I've been promoted twice, raised my salary by 57%, got onto a Nature paper, and achieved a childhood dream. Can't ask for more."

2012 was when I started my masters and it was a dark time for us. My mom was losing her funding (she did cancer research), and so we relied on my dad for income, but we knew we were probably going to go paycheck-to-paycheck as my stipend was a pittance (literally earning like $360/month). Then dad became sick, he developed a brain aneurysm, multiple small strokes, and had internal bleeding with the medicine the doctors gave him that almost killed him. I remember carrying his body into his car so that I could take him to the hospital because we couldnt afford an ambulance.

Mom gave up part of her retirement money, we voluntarily retired my dad, and used that to run the show while I tried to get my masters done and get the fuck out as soon as possible so I could get a job and support them (at least temporarily). This is why I got the job first before finishing the defense as my advisor was holding it up and saying that he could pay me $1400/mo to help him at the observatory while I completed my degree. No thank you.

Thankfully my hirers at work completely and fully understood and supported me and paid me at the master's degree salary instead of the bachelors so I could help the family out while I completed stuff here.

Best believe I worked my tail off for the next two years both at work, at home, and for my masters.

Within two.5 years I was promoted, which pissed off my officemate since he had spent 5 years there by the time I had been promoted, and only recently had gotten promoted to the same level...

What upsets me too is that my officemate knows the situation I was in for my masters degree and doesn't give it any credit. No sympathy about caring for my parents or anything.

I don't have time for bullshit anymore man. I'm so focused on my next goal that I just don't care for people trying to trip me up because of their own insecurities. We drive ourselves, no-one else does. We have things that we need to do, we have responsibilities. We are meant for big things.

We are being tested constantly. It’s up to us to take on the challenge and succeed.
