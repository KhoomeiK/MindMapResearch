I’m not saying the reaction to this is necessarily ok, but I believe the person we perceive to be at fault here is the person who’s the most anxious.

Lastly, the movements of the vehicle do not seem to be harmful, but moreso trying to shake human beings off of the vehicle without causing bodily harm."
