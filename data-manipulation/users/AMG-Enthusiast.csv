This is still the internet by the way.. you’re a spec in the overall population of Reddit let alone the World Wide Web. Most people haven’t seen the post before because they don’t spend every second of every day scrolling through their feeds. So reposts are essentially highlights from the past incase you missed it.

GetMotivated,fdl9oar,t1_fdl6a6s,1578519422.0,"I think so. Ferragamo offers shoes that don’t even have the Gancini bits/SF label on them. It’s just a leather shoe with the brand label inside of the shoe. Very traditional marketing in my opinion, and personally something that appeals to me because I don’t like people looking at me and the clothes I’m wearing lol. Conversely, I’m not sure Gucci wants to make shoes without people knowing exactly who makes them."
GetMotivated,fdl58fk,t1_fdl4boe,1578517254.0,Fair. Not the shoes though. Shoes are the foundation of the brand. And that was more so what I was alluding too. Should have clarified. My fault

GetMotivated,fdkzt4z,t1_fdkv0p6,1578514518.0,Yeah that’s just not true lol. I would say in most cases it’s almost the opposite. People with a lot of money typically don’t feel the need to show off their wealth through clothing.

Patriots,fd7596i,t1_fd71w2u,1578199599.0,I’m not a Patriot fan but I can’t overlook how well of a game Tennessee played. Vrabel is a hell of a coach. We all know why.
nfl,fd740fc,t3_ek7zm4,1578199142.0,"2 things about this game that I hope doesn’t get overlooked:

First; Mike Vrabel, a great coach with a great future, milked the clock with multiple delay of game penalties on 4th down to which could have either worked to his advantage which it did, 
OR possibly came back to spite him if the Patriots happened to score on the next drive. Most ironic part? Bill Belichick was fuming to the referees as it was happening when HE was the one who introduced the league to the loophole during the Patriots 33-0 week 7 victory over the Jets. It was a test of Adam Gase’s will to not call a timeout.

Second and lastly, I absolutely love that the Miami Dolphins who were widely considered the leagues worst team early in the season, just so happened to be the team to beat New England in week 17 to make their lives that much harder and take away their divisional round playoff bye week. If Miami doesn’t win, New England’s road to Super Bowl 54 is that much easier and that much more likely."

I belong to a private club. They don’t require a handicap submission every round especially if you’re bringing guests. Basically, they let recreational golfers play the way they want to play without being overly assertive about official scoring. However, if you’re ever thinking about entering a tournament, you must submit scores every round and meet the minimum amount of full rounds played before the tournament. For me, I do submit every round. But it’s not mandatory."

politics,fcuwx95,t1_fctv3ln,1577990179.0,"So then wipe a few strokes off of your handicap pre-round. This was my point. It’s technically “going easy” but in a subtle way that your opponent doesn’t have to know about unless they know your true hc. But personally, I don’t care who you are, if we play I’m trying to win. If you can’t handle a little friendly competition with maybe a few bucks on the line, especially as the president, then maybe you shouldn’t be golfing in the first place.
