So you might be wondering, what is a persistency mod for COH?  


Well it's kind of like crossing a tabletop game like Warhammer with Company of heroes.  


Instead of capturing resource points and setting up buildings to create units in the game (like a normal game of COH or COH2), in a mod like OMG you instead use a set amount of resources to create your  company before you even start the game.  


You pre-select everything from your units, to their upgrades and even your doctrine unlocks.  


Then, when the game begins, you have only those units to call on over the course of the battle.   


But, all units who survive the battle (are retreated before they are completely wipe out) retain their veterancy from one match to the next."

In this video we're doing something called ""wearing"". Which is where the handler backs up or walks in a direction and the dog has to hold the sheep to them.

It looks easy right? It's not.

In this video, every move and decision Hendrix is making is the reason why the sheep are staying tight together, right next to the handler, and following me to the letter.

If he wasn't working them with every moment and step, or if he wasn't carefully directing them with his body language, position and amount of ""pressure"" they would be either all over the place or nowhere close to me."
WorldOfWarships,ffd230o,t1_ffcmcuk,1579811890.0,"If your winrate is sub 50%, it means you, on average, help your team win less than the average player.  And instead, on average, perform below replacement (aka. if you were replaced with an average WOWS player) at helping your team win.

Now I know many people have a visceral reaction to winrate and say things like ""that just means I get a lot of shitty teams!"" but the fact of the matter is, over hundreds of game, there is only one constant: you. And the players who have 55-65% winrates are not just lucky with their teams. They make good decisions and have a degree of skill that allows them to influence that portion of games that can be influenced by an individual. (Some games are won or lost regardless of an individual player).

That doesn't mean you are neccessarily worse than the average player in a 1v1, or less accurate when you shoot, getting damage, or worse at staying alive.

Influencing wins is about how you make decisions that help your team win. And sometimes that could mean shooting a destroyer for 2k damage instead of farming 30k fire damage a big juicy battleship. Or it could mean you move in just to tank damage to distract the enemy team from shooting at your low health radar cruiser so that he can get away.

It can mean knowing when NOT to follow your team on a lemming train (when maybe following them would mean you would probably live longer in the match and get to farm easy damage) to instead go to the weak side and kite... if for no other reason than to delay the enemy team from sweeping through a weak flank and encircling your team in the end game.

Learning all of these things, and learning how to influence wins, will mean that you WILL see your winrate rise to 50%, then 52, then 54, and eventually 60%+.

And it won't be because you just get lucky and don't have shit teams anymore. It will be because you will no longer be the kind of player that someone else sees on their team (and checks their stats) and says to themselves ""i got a shit team."""
Thedaily,ff75o7b,t1_ff73hhl,1579641620.0,">Well, if we’re talking about investigating 2016 election tampering, that is absolutely in the interest of the US and not just POTUS. Yes, even if said investigation happens to put crosshairs on a political opponent. Further, the US frequently puts stipulations on foreign aid.

So there are a few important inaccuracies to unpack here.

The first: Trump's current impeachment trial is NOT about 2016 election tampering, so no we are not talking about that. The Mueller investigation was focused on the 2016 election, Russian interference, and whether Trump and his associates obstructed justice. 

This impeachment, however, is specifically about his pressuring a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election. 

The democrats were weighing, if you recall, including articles of impeachment relating to the 2016 election and the findings of the Mueller report but specifically decided against it. 

So, again, your question of whether Trump was trying to interfere with a future election or investigate a past one is once again not relevant. Because this Impeachment process is literally about investigating whether or not he did the former. Because that would be a high crime/misdemeanour. And the Senate will decide whether they feel there is enough evidence to support that (or enough to persuade them to vote against their party at the least).

Second, you mentioned that ""the US frequently puts stipulations on foreign aid"" which is a true, but not relevant distinction.

Why? Because it belies a fundamental misunderstanding of what the articles of impeachment that have been put forward actually say.

They do not say ""The house has found evidence and heard extensive testimony which suggest that Trump applied stipulations on foreign aid.""

Instead, what they do say is: ""Trump applied stipulations on foreign aid specifically to harm a political rival for personal gain"".

And what evidence did they recieve to support that important charge? Extensive testimony from career, bi-partisan diplomats and even Trump appointees themselves (Sondland as just one example) who all emphatically confirmed that there was an official track of foreign policy toward Ukraine (they are an ally, we must do everything to support them against Russia both symbolically and financially) and a separate, irregular, and murky track of foreign policy being quarterbacked by Giuliani... that directly hindered, or contradicted, the official track.

Now, you can decide that you don't trust these hours of testimony from career diplomats (many who have worked in their roles for both Republican and Democrat presidents), trump appointees, and written records (text messages etc.). And the Senate may still very well decide they aren't convinced that these people are telling the truth.

But their testimony certainly constitutes a sufficient foundation of evidence to at least HAVE a trial.

>Further, spare me NYT’s take on whether Biden did anything wrong -especially in the age of rampant TDS. I remember a time when NYT was a credible source of news, that was quite a while ago. No different than Fox News at this point, just the other side of the coin.

You've kind of just demonstrated you didn't even read the NYT article because if you had, you'd realize two important things:

1. The article very clearly does lay out that Biden acted unethically, or at least highly irresponsibly, in regards to his conflict of interest with Ukraine.

2. That I am clearly not telling you I don't think Biden did anything wrong. Which not only did I not say (I said it's not relevant to whether Trump did something impeachable, which it absolutely is not), but if I did believe I certainly wouldn't have linked you to an article that pretty objectively lays out the issues and problems with what Biden did (or did not do in terms of disclosing and removing himself from conflict).

 
My strong advice would be to read the article in question (or the articles of impeachment in question) before jumping to conclusions that aren't accurate."
Thedaily,ff6wwe2,t1_ff6p359,1579636558.0,">I guess you’d have to first ask yourself the question that was he influenced by disdain of the 2016 election tampering or looking to tamper with 2020? Very different situations.

No, you wouldn't have to ask yourself that question because it's not a relevant one.

If I leverage my power as a head of state to induce a foreign power to help me personally (by them announcing they're looking into corruption claims against my most popular political opponent), especially if one of the core pieces of leverage i'm applying is in direct contradiction to official foreign policy (which was that it was in America's direct interest to provide military/financial support to Ukraine to help vs Russia, as Sondland and career diplomats testified)... that is absolutely a serious issue worthy of an impeachment inquiry.

Because whether it was my primary motive or an incidental benefit, I abused my office and if I had succeeded at what I attempted to do a future election would have been compromised.  


>Further, If you believe the latter how then should Biden be dealt with for his actions with Ukraine during the Obama Admin?

 My thoughts about [Biden's activities during Obama's admin](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/joe-biden-ukraine.html), or what should be done about them, are irrelevant to whether President Trump committed an impeachable offense.   


Both sets of actions can be wrong, but one being wrong does not make the other right or vice versa.  


Whataboutism has no place in a discussion about whether an impeachable offense occurred. It can be an effective deflection tactic (and one we've seen employed to great effect in this impeachment circus), but impeachment deals very specifically with determining whether a sitting US elected official committed high crimes or misdemeanours."
Thedaily,ff6mc3l,t1_ff6k36j,1579630259.0,"The fact that impeachment as laid out in the constitution doesn't require actual crimes notwithstanding, I think it's pretty obvious that pressuring a foreign head of state to investigate one of your political rivals, and holding up congressionally approved military aid to that head of state's country as part of that pressure, is definitely in the realm of the plausibly criminal."

This video was taken shortly after [this photo from my post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/ep5pjz/sorting_sheep_with_help_from_my_partner/).

In it, we're working on Hendrix's:

1. Outrun: The initial wide flank to go out and fetch the sheep. If the dog is doing its outrun perfectly, it should run wide and along the ""bubble"" of the sheep so as not to move them in any way until the dog has reached the right point of ""balance"" (usually directly opposite the handle on the other side of the sheep... but the exact varies greatly depending on the field). Hendrix is still a young dog (2 years old) and we haven't quite mastered staying nice and wide on the bubble to avoid moving the sheep until he's in the right position...  especially at the ""top"". He just is so keen to get to the sheep and start controlling them that it's an ongoing project for us that will need plenty more practice.
2. Fetch: The act of bringing the sheep directly back to the handler. If done perfectly, the ""line"" from where the sheep were originally positioned to the handler should be exactly straight. To do this the dog has to perfectly read the sheep, the field, and the pressures working on the sheep (from himself and from the terrain) to position himself to achieve this. Again, Hendrix is pretty good at this but our lines are not yet perfect so much more practice is still needed.
3. Drive: The act of pushing the sheep away from the handler in the desired direction. Similar to the fetch, the sign of a very good team is that this line is as straight as possible. Driving is even harder than fetching though because the dog's natural instinct is to bring the handler (pack leader) sheep... so  it takes a lot of practice and training to get a good, solid drive. Hendrix has no problem moving the sheep, which is great... but our lines (noticing a pattern here?) definitely need some work. Top handlers and dogs (especially in competitions) can maintain extremely precise lines so there's a lot of work involved to get that level of teamwork and precision.
4. Cross Drive: The act of not just driving the sheep, but driving the sheep perpendicular to the position of the handler. You can see us working on this in the video around the 2 minute mark when I flank Hendrix off the straight-away course and we start pushing the sheep to the right. This is even more challenging than a regular drive because the dog naturally wants to flank all the way around the sheep and start fetching again (due to their instinct). And it can be tricky to get precise flanks (to keep the line straight) because the whole time the dog's brain is screaming ""BRING THE SHEEP BACK TO THE LEADER"". It takes a lot of practice to build up the dog's confidence and comfort with not doing what its instinct tells it to do here. Hendrix is definitely getting there, but as you can see in our video (and the fact I have to repeat a flank command 3x) we still have much work to do.

Also, some of the commands you'll hear in this video are:

* Come by: Flank around the sheep clockwise. Depending on your tone, how long you draw out this command, or whether you shorten to just ""come"" the border collie will know the different nuance of what you actually want it to do. Because sometimes you only want a little flank and sometimes you want him to go far around the sheep. They are extremely intuitive animals who read context and tone to determine what even the same word might mean.
* Away to me: Flank around the sheep counter clockwise. Likewise with ""come by""  the dog knows that shortened versions of this command, or changes in tone or volume, mean different severity of flanks.
* Lie Down: Stop in your current position (or nearby depending on if you need to make slight adjustments to maintain the sheep). Depending on the context, the dog knows that lie down does not always mean he has to literally lie his body down. Sometimes he knows it just means ""stop or reduce putting pressure on the sheep for the moment until instructed otherwise.""
* Walk Up: Approach the sheep... but appropriately"
dogswithjobs,feid6ru,t1_fei81q0,1579135755.0,"Sometimes you need to sort off the males from the females,  or you need to separate some off for de-worming, or you just only need 3 out of a group of 16 to do some practicing with your dog in a separate field.  


Basically if you raise and keep sheep, hardly a week will go by when you won't need to separate out some number of sheep from others... and usually it's multiple times a day."
dogswithjobs,feiczl2,t1_fei9io8,1579135622.0,"You're correct that (for those dogs who have them) coloured eyebrows can be useful in helping to herd, but not because prey don't know where they are looking.

In fact the famous ""border collie stare"" that the best working dogs of the breed are known for is actually about precision and sending clear, unambiguous information to the prey: I am a predator, I mean business, and my intent is very clear.

As they learn how sheep respond to every move, position and subtle thing they do... they quickly learn how to manipulate every aspect of their body (including their eyebrows) to get the desired response from the sheep (aka. moving them 6 inches diagonally right instead of 3 inches diagonally left).

Hendrix in particular is very fun to watch up close because, especially when he was younger and still figuring out what kinds of reactions all the part of his body could elicit from sheep, he uses his eyebrows alot (moving them, raising them, lowering them etc.) to move sheep."

dogswithjobs,feicawx,t1_fehp7j0,1579135162.0,"It's easily the most complicated thing I have ever tried to learn, and you can do it for 30 years (as all of the top handlers, which I am nowhere close to being, will tell you) and still be constantly learning and making mistakes.

Here's a decent video on YouTube that I think does a decent job explaining some of the fundamental principles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oTBfqmIGLA"
dogswithjobs,feic157,t1_fehsn6k,1579134981.0,"So there is a lot to unpack in your  questions because there are tons of forces at play in the complex relationship between sheep (or any common form of livestock) and sheepdogs. Especially compared to other kinds of dogs.

First, we have to talk about what border collies are actually doing when they ""herd"" and why they as a breed are so effective at it.

So what are they doing? They're pack hunting. 

They're responding to verbal and physical cues (from their pack leader and from the prey) in order to assess flight zones and adjust their positioning/posture/pace in order to move the prey into a position for the pack to make the kill.

Border collie herding is, essentially, humans preserving and cultivating the ancestral pack hunting instincts of border collies and then just stopping short of the final step: making the kill.

But it's not just about instincts when it comes to breeding border collies, the very structure of their bodies is involved. Border collies have distinct physiological differences (and not just their bigger brains or high capacity lungs) that suit them to herding. As just one example, you can see in this picture how Hendrix is almost in a crouch position. That's because he's a purebred working lines border collie so his front legs are structurally designed to help him more easily embody the body language and posture of a predator. In show lines border collies (which aren't really border collies tbh), you often don't see that anymore. Which is why show lines/conformation border collies look so damn weird.

Finally their is the training. A good sheepdog (border collie or otherwise) will have had years of training. While they can be born with a ton of great instincts from their pack hunting ancestry, the best sheepdogs hone their power (how effective they are at convincing stock to move), their feel (how sensitive they are to precise changes in their body language and pace to speed up, slow down or otherwise influence the prey) and their knowledge and understanding of specific commands, tasks, etc.

In essence, a well trained border collie knows exactly what a half centimetre move of his paw, or a twitch of his eyebrow, or a slight rustle of his tail, will do to the sheep he's working. And the world of difference between being in one spot in relation to the sheep and being 6 inches over from that spot.

On the other side of the spectrum, the sheep themselves are also highly evolved prey animals. Sheep have been purposefully bred for centuries and millennia to be flocking prey animals that identify, recognize and respond appropriately to predators. And so while sheep might not be intelligent like a border collie is, they have exceptionally well developed instincts when it comes to reading a dog's body language, intent, physical capabilities and confidence.

So to a sheep, it's not only that all types of dogs (livestock, house pet, show dogs, agility dogs etc.) aren't the same. They will even treat two working lines, well trained border collie sheepdogs differently.

When you or I look at a dog, we see a dog. When they look at a dog, they are looking at hundreds (if not thousands) of variables to calculate whether its a threat in general, whether it's intending to be a threat right now, and then how much of a threat it is... on a spectrum with thousands of degrees of severity."
