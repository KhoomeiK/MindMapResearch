If you don't have Spotify. Look up ""parcast presents roaring 20's"" it's somewhere in season 4. It's a 2 part episode"
todayilearned,fftiyd4,t1_ffti1xs,1580221776.0,Parcast presents roaring 20's. I listened to it on Spotify. It's a 2 part series. https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qZXyxZZXLLu1YxX2ZNZbp?si=9hIEriT8RSS0jgHh7gprPQ
todayilearned,ffthc3q,t1_fftfnrw,1580220551.0,Just listened to a podcast that talked about his rise and fall as a gangster. He probably would have been on the top for much longer if it wasn't for a STD that spread to his brain. Tough way to die.

I forgot my password to all 5! Nothing like having to track down IT to get those all reset. Just glad my boss is chill as heck"
todayilearned,ff37g3i,t1_ff34ex7,1579535492.0,"Stanley Roberts little shows are terribly written. He has a series on the news called ""behaving badly"" where they catch people doing something illegal. It's always some really obscure law that nobody pays attention to, and he never really fully explains why it's illegal. The whole thing is a mess."
google,ff20bvu,t3_eihbyc,1579490421.0,"I recently started a new job and need some advice on keeping things organized. It boils down to this, I am in charge of 6 locations and need to visit these locations twice monthly. I also have to make notes according to these visits (thinking of using Keep for this). With other daily meeting and daily tasks, my calendar can get super full. Would keeping a separate calendar for each location be a good idea? I have already figured out how to stack and unstack calendars.  I'm new to the ""white collar"" world and using a computer to keep things organized is all new to me. Looking for advice"
mildlyinteresting,femqsjp,t1_femk8dw,1579266897.0,"I'm sure my teacher taught something. It was probably good. I passed the class by showing up every day, writing my name correctly, and turning in assignments and tests. I could have gotten 0% correct on every assignment/test but arriving and making an attempt was enough to get a C. Teachers really didn't care."
AskReddit,fdxkoug,t1_fdxjvua,1578769816.0,It was a few months ago. Definitely a good listen.
AskReddit,fdxfxos,t1_fdwusga,1578768357.0,And it is biased. All of the questions were based off of upper class white Europeans. So the test does not work for any other ethnicities or people who were labeled as lower class. Heard that on a podcast......sooooo
Prisonwallet,fdqmo3e,t1_fdqc65x,1578670291.0,Level 5 for fraud? Based on this and other comments I'm calling BS. This type of room would not be for someone with the charges you claim to have.

My kids watched about 20 videos of some weird ass channel and for nearly 3 weeks anything that popped up had these guys faces on it. I had to request not to see them over 100 times. If they do any crossover work, be prepared to stay busy."
AskReddit,fdcvm6x,t1_fdb4ymc,1578285594.0,This was the first story on Reddit that had me rolling. I go back to read it every few months just for good laughs.
AskReddit,fd0s2g3,t1_fd0595j,1578122989.0,"I left for a week and people called me constantly asking where I was and when I was coming back. My coworkers acted like I left them for a year. They were all grateful I was back. That was until I requested more vacation. It was denied, denied again, flat out refused. My last day is Monday. Everyone is in a panick. They are stretched thin as it is, and have no idea how to do my job. The company owes me 400 hrs of vacation pay, and have voiced their concern on writing a check that big outside of payroll. All this is happening because they know my worth and didn't want me to go on another vacation. Guess what jerks, I chose my family over my ""work family"". Best wishes"

AskReddit,fciqlh9,t1_fcgu3gk,1577667472.0,It's why I put in my 2 weeks recently. Companies do not give a flying flip about you.
