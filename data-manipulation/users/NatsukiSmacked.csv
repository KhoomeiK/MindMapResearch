Especially since I was struggling with getting to a normal weight, on both ends. I started out way to skinny in HS and then put a lot on and now in uni my BMI is again dropping under 22, because I can't get stuff down without feeling gross, yet again."

aspergers_dating,ferzzan,t1_ferzo1b,1579360065.0,"Oh no my bad, I just meant to imply that love leads to eventual procreation. And thats not a goal of mine. It was worded poorly, I am aware that intimacy =/= love."
aspergers_dating,ferz224,t1_feryp8h,1579359834.0,"There are things in life that have priority over procreation, no? I should first finish my bachelors degree. 

Also people seem to always be disappointed and miserable after love so I'm not particularly looking forward to it."

aspergers_dating,ferxaf4,t3_eqh4d4,1579359307.0,"The real question is, why would you bother getting to know someone like this so well that you know he even hates his mother. That doesn't sound like something he'd tell you on a first date. It's not because he is an aspie and neither because he is a man. Whats next, was he white as well? Don't generalise people based on genetics and disabilities, that's not cool. That being said, this dude is nuts."

GrafOnEle,fefix83,t3_eotou8,1579057280.0,"I have thought quite a bit about this mentality and the connection to stoicism. I like this way of approaching life, it's a rather healthy way that will help you grow as a person and also help with the everyday troubles one might face."

TrueOffMyChest,fefikrm,t1_fef27hv,1579057069.0,"I am pretty sure no one does in my case - total loner, family consist only of mother who openly hates me and stepsiblings who I barely know. I don't have any friends at the moment, at least since I moved to the new town. And it's been 1.5 years already. I am pretty confident in saying that no one genuinely loves me. Its hard to grasp when you have never been in that spot before, I suppose.
To my defense, I am not actively seeking out love anyways, I currently have other ambitions, and feel okay with the way my social life is going right now."

GrafOnEle,fe7n8i0,t3_enz21i,1578916898.0,6. Have a sleep schedule; get atleast 6 hours of sleep per day. When doesn't matter as long as you can be consistent with the schedule
IncelsWithoutHate,fe66rae,t1_fe66fnl,1578883049.0,"Actually, PM me my guy! Im done for trying something like this. Its close to 3:40 am here though, so ill have to get some sleep considering that I have to be up in roughly 4 hours."

""The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they will have a chance of maltreating someone.

Schizoid,fe3sqx3,t3_enq9t2,1578852546.0,"This might sound trivial at first but try picking up chess. Chess is wonderful, it might give you a sense of purpose and ego. You can start making an account on lichess right now and play some games online. Or even join a local chess club if you feel comfortable doing that. Chess is full of clumsy but funny characters, I made great friends in my chess days, even though I have a hard time with people, not due to SPD but autism.
You can push yourself and try to get better and you'll see that its very rewarding. The more you train the better you get and you can do all the training in your head or within the comfort of your home. Its worth a shot!"

That sounds awesome, a paper on analytical number theory! In which programms context did you write it? As in like bachelor thesis or an assigment or so on, im genuinely curious!"
Schizoid,fdnushc,t1_fdncib5,1578593268.0,"Its basically the pythagorean theorem generalised, worth readin into. Also, its a special case of the bessel inequality, just some fun facts I guess. Functional analysis is great."
Schizoid,fdnbvww,t1_fdnblxi,1578582445.0,"I've found a tricky solution to that recently! With a fourier series of a periodic linear function you can use the parseval identity, evaluate the integral of the function and thats what the sum converges to- and the fourier series / sum just so happens to be of the form ""something""/n^2 . So now kust divide the integral by this something and you get pi^2 / 6 . Pretty tricky and fun, fourier series' are a powerful tool for analytical number theory!"
Schizoid,fdnalgv,t1_fdn7wb8,1578581602.0,"Number theory is awesome. Especially when connected with some spicy abstract algebra. Calculus is also fun, PDE are a quite a blast. Also, distributions and functionals are pretty cool."

TrueOffMyChest,fdn0dle,t3_em4x3u,1578573332.0,"Okay so you hate this community? Cool, understandable, you know. A reasonable approach would be, to not be angry on the internet and not actively seek out things that make you angry, eh? I dont go out of my way to get all worked up and spew shit on modern pop music thats on the radio. Its terrible, a fucking joke, commercial, braindead 4 chords music. But I don't go around telling people that I think all of those producers should get banned forever. I dont actively seek something to get angry at online. If some 5'3'' guy wants to be sad for being 5'3'' let him be sad. Let this dude have his opinion, its a tough world out there I'm sure he has his reasons to be upset. Does he deal with it correctly by becoming an incel? Probably not, lets be real. No one wants to be an incel, eh? But by god just let this guy have his self loathing on the internet, no one not a single soul forces you to seek out such content and get all angry about it. Why kick someone whos already on the ground crying? Not even just kicking, actively looking out for him, finding him, running up to him and then start kicking, while fantasizing about kicking him for the entire process.

There are much worse much more toxic communities on reddit and the internet in general, and they dont deserve to be banned as long as they dont engage in illegal stuff. Its their right to exist on here as well as it is your right to make this post. 

But hey, I gtg, I gotta listen to godawful music to get all worked up again and write angry letters about how I think those music producers should all be sent of to siberian gulags. But I wont tell them directly, ill only share my opinion where the vast majority of people will agree with me because then I dont have to think and just bash these stupid folks without any other reason than ""wow I hate them and their music"" :-)"
