I’m well aware that my current situation is not s constant, especially because I live in europe, so school, University and Public Transfer are almost completely free, neither do I pay taxes, or will for the foreseeable future, so of course a 3 person (I assume) family has much higher expenses on a yearly basis.

My initial comment was meant as a light hearted jab, That’s why I commented the whole „I don’t have living standards“ thing
I agree with your YTA judgement completely, sorry if this came across as more serious than initially intended."

SelfAwarewolves,ff9smvn,t1_ff9rzwu,1579720361.0,"No, I was actually gonna say that white people did have an advantage on building large societies. 
Every industrial nation is build on animal labour, hence why most large cities had plagues throughout history. To do that, you need to domesticate said animals, which need to have certain qualities to them, such as social structure, Availability and selection of mates, their response to humans and flexibility in changing environments, that’s why we were able to domesticate horses, but not zebras.
Most of the animals that fulfill these criteria are commonly found in, you guessed it, the euroasian continent. Look at the cow, the chicken, the sheep, all animals which played a tremendous part in building society as we know it. 
It’s not about our genetics, we just got lucky with the spawn point."

unpopularopinion,ff2rmcf,t1_ff2qa94,1579521043.0,"As I said, that sucks, but it doesn’t really fall under reproductive rights. It’s financial / legal rights , because you’re not actually reproducing, and like I said I don’t think that paying for a child you neither wanted nor helped create should be legally enforced(lying about it knowingly should also be a criminal offence) , and I also believe that circumcising your baby is child abuse. So I’m not disagreeing with most of your points, but I would rather be a man (when it comes to reproductive rights) in this day and age and pay (unjustified) child support, than be denied an abortion or Sterilisation, but thats my personal opinion."
unpopularopinion,ff2q757,t1_ff2paro,1579518978.0,"To be fair, while I completely support financial abortion and not paying Child support to a kid that isn’t yours, men do have more reproductive rights than women. It’s not that hard to get sterilised as a man at 18, while women, in most cases, have that denied to them until their either married and have a child, or are around 30."
