Can’t remember what the actual product names are, but I remember a thread about it on Reddit a while back."
todayilearned,ffl3egq,t1_ffk1g2t,1580034080.0,I read about that on Bloosh!

belowdeck,ffktous,t1_ffjvvu0,1580028678.0,"I never understood why Kate had such an issue with that dish. 

He made it once per charter, so no guest ever ate it twice, and the guests LOVED it EVERY time it was served. 

All she could say was that he wasn’t creative and was lazy because he served the same dish all the time. 

Well, if it’s a hit every time, why not serve it?"

belowdeck,ffi2pzq,t1_ffi1lzx,1579963352.0,"Honestly, I think she just can’t handle being at the bottom of the team. 

In her other life she is the Captain of her boat, on the show she is 3rd deck hand. That’s a BIG change from being the one in control of everything to being the person that gets the shit jobs. 

BTW, I said the same thing last year. She just simply cannot handle being given orders.
