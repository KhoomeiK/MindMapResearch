Healthcare needs to be a basic human right, and I’ve found more often than not doctors that are dismissive like this are the majority in this messed up system.

AskReddit,ff3x557,t1_feo200x,1579550781.0,"I’m the wife of an army veteran. He was deployed to Kuwait but was handling ISIS/ISIL before the general US population knew of them or the threat they posed. He, too, did not disclose any sort of dark side of the deployment. He was gone for nine months and would joke around about Kuwait being “a vacation,” downplaying it substantially. 

His older brother went to Afghanistan for 5 months and did suffer hearing loss from an IED, but no other combat or encounters. Plus, two older surrogate brothers to him had also deployed, one a Marine who was in Fallujah right when we first went in. So my husband didn’t feel “deserving” of trauma he suffered, nor did he believe that if he disclosed it that he would be met with support.

He did intel and was over there a month before ISIS invaded Fallujah. His job involved 12 hours a day of non-stop monitoring the brutal slaughter as if he was watching it on go-pro. He can describe the sound of a beheading in disturbing precision. He was also one of the only sections in the unit packed to evacuate Baghdad at any given moment. With no backup. I had NO idea about any of this, not at the time and not until years after his return. My once gentle and sensitive husband became hardened, cold, aggressive. It didn’t become apparent until our first son was born. I imagine the trauma of watching children die is why. It began to break our marriage. I had no idea who I was married to and why he was so very different.

One day we were painting our remodeled bedroom and I playfully teased him about something harmless, but he completely lost it on me. He had never raised his voice to me ever prior to this. I left the house for several hours because it was that severe. When I returned that night, he finally opened up to me about everything overseas. Since then, I’ve been his caregiver and support in getting therapy and treatment. I sat there during his evaluation for disability and listened to things that I wasn’t prepared to hear. 

But here is my point in all of this- it doesn’t change how I see him. I can identify with your wife’s politics about war, but that child wasn’t an innocent child. She was an imminent threat and there was nothing that would have changed that. It was either you shot her or you didn’t come home. I couldn’t ever hold that against my husband. Clearly you aren’t a monster because this haunts you. You don’t seem to take pleasure out of it, or display crudeness regarding the story. You did what you were trained to do and you made the right call. I know that service member’s are notoriously anti-therapy, especially being taught compartmentalism and duty over self. But therapy gives him an hour a week to go speak very candidly to a former marine who can help him cope and develop some sort of an enjoyable life. I even attend sessions once in a while if I feel he’s not being accountable for his triggers, or in denial about being in a bad place. His commitment to processing the trauma and healing is what saved our marriage.

Please don’t leave your wife in the dark. Secrets always have a way of surfacing and her finding out in some other manner is likely to startle her more than if you bare your raw regret. I’m not her so I don’t know how she will react, but she seems to love you so I fully believe she will process and make sure to comfort you and help with healing. The VA operates satellite locations called the Vet Center and they are far more accessible. You can do 1:1 with former veterans who know what you’re going through, there’s support groups where you can go in and candidly talk about how fucked up it was, there’s spousal counseling and support groups to help her deal and help you, etc.

I’d be happy to help you track down your local one. Maybe if you tell her in that setting it will be easier for you. I wish you the best of luck sir."

Her announcement of that started a world of shit with his other kids and became a full blown feud. I couldn’t understand how we could be connected because there were no DNA matches on ancestry. I ended up doing a lot of footwork and confirmed it was the third candidate. I even was able to confirm his death and the suspicious cause, via an archived newspaper article from the 70s. I looked up his three other children who were tots when he died, they all look identical to my mom. They have a very high opinion of their father and their mom is in the later stages of Alzheimer’s. She seems to have a romanticized view of their marriage, as do the kids. I decided not to tell anyone what I discovered. It would only hurt my mom and make her feel foolish for her good faith belief. It would shatter the illusion that three others have of their dad, whom they lost very young. And it would likely make a poor older woman feel her whole marriage was a lie.

I had no interest, there was no reason to rush. I had power of attorney so I could make sure his finances weren’t screwed with (a lot of victims of identity theft in deployed service members), to re-up our lease, and to make sure I could make important decisions if needed.

You would need to check with your individual plan and what coverage you have though. A reduction should in no way affect your fertility or ability to nurse in the future if you so chose. A reduction is the removal of fatty tissue, glandular tissue, skin, etc. Then it is restructured in a proportion that is best suited for your individual body type. The focus is not so much cup size as it is eliminating health challenges and maximizing comfort. There are a few methods and each involves different risks or contraindications.
