Feelings,fdnpnm6,t1_fdlyv37,1578590510.0,Try talking to her at school before you jump that far.
AstralProjection,fdn0zsm,t3_em7rx6,1578573934.0,"This is really interesting to hear about. You shouldn’t be worried, from what you’ve described, she seems to be Astral Projecting. Astral Projecting is in now way harmful. The worst that could happen is sleep paralysis, while still not harmful, is frightening especially for a little girl. 

I know some people referred to the 5 powers of buddhist whatever. (No disrespect of course).

She’s 6, I doubt she knows what shes doing, let alone some mystical powers. It could be something she saw on TV or at school she thought was cool, most kids do this. 

I don’t see a problem with her APing as there are no dangers, but just let her keep doing what she’s doing. You don’t have to teach her that she can go other places, it’d be best if she stayed in the house in my opinion, at her age."
AstralProjection,fdl9ool,t3_els8ly,1578519427.0,"It seems like a weird lucid dream, I’m not sure it was AP. As you didn’t mention vibrations, or things that go with APing. You probably just lucid dreamed, and once you woke up you had sleep paralysis. It happens a lot. If you don’t know what lucid dreaming is, or you want to do it again, r/luciddreaming should help you."

Feelings,fdj6az1,t3_ee00gd,1578459653.0,"I know exactly how you feel, its like you’re dragging through life. It’s hard to wake up in the morning because that means you have to be yourself for an entire day. The little pleasures you have either fade quickly, or leave you. It’s not that you want to die, you just want to feel okay."

I wrote one today, with the intention of posting it on here, it was too short though. If I kept adding on to it, it would have lost the point I was trying to make."

I love how it was always there, but we didn’t find out until the end. 

What do you mean “when I found out”?"
mildlyinteresting,fdcw255,t3_ekgf1e,1578285970.0,I love this idea.
shortstories,fdcvlvt,t1_fdcvg38,1578285587.0,"Yeah, I mean out of all places it’d be a giant coincidence.  A sad one, if anything. 


If she’s blind, I assume it was hard to get there in first place, let alone walk around in a forest. Which is why I assumed when you had her trip, she was trying to pick back up the gun she had dropped. 

Either way an interesting story, good work!"

AstralProjection,fdcklck,t3_ekmlnp,1578277224.0,"Honestly, it sounds like you were APing. Relatively speaking, dreaming is similar to APing, so if you were ‘dreaming you were APing’ I believe you’d just be APing."

But, the U.S. is making progress, and easing tensions with NK and its leader, if NK were to fight against us in a war, it would be at the very least, political suicide."
