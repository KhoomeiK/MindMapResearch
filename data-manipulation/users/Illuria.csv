WarhammerCompetitive,fekdnf9,t1_fekbah4,1579197855.0,"As a T'au player, yeah I get your frustration. It's a shame but that's the nature of the army you've chosen, and its lack of line-of-sight ignoring firepower is one of the reasons it's not as powerful as it could be and is not overly competitive as a faction in a competitive scenario (depending on your local meta).  
The problem with playing T'au is on the T'au faction, but it's not on the T'au players. Largely, to compete at a high level, the Triptide is pretty much the only option we have left. The rest of the codex is crap, markerlights are dogshit, our ballistic skill is awful and Crisis Suits suck dick.  
Stealth suits might be coming back to be fair, they got a hefty drop in CA2019 and were already decent.  
It's not fun as a T'au player either, and it's super frustrating that GW has made this our niche. T'au get hate no matter how they are (people were still salty at the start of 8th when we were forced to Commander spam because everything else sucked) and it's incredibly draining. Most of us in 8th play the army because we love it, and placing T'au down on a table and hearing 'Ugh! Tau' from your opponent makes you not want to play any more.
OP mentioned his two armies, and both have solutions for LOS-hiding units. Nightspinners for Eldar and Thunderfires for SM (and Eliminators too)."
WarhammerCompetitive,fekb13p,t1_fek9ydd,1579196306.0,"Yes, this is spot on. As a T'au player I'd love if we didn't have to rely upon shield drones but sadly we do, and it's not going to get better without a wholesale rewrite of the T'au codex. It was written by the same guy who wrote the Guard codex, and reportedly he had never played a game with T'au before writing the codex. Whether that's just a rumour or not, it certainly feels that way. The low BS and the poor markerlights this edition feel awful, especially when Eldar, Nurgle and everyone else are throwing around minuses to hit like candy."
WarhammerCompetitive,fekae2p,t1_fek9nmz,1579195930.0,"Gotcha, potentially even more egregious for you then since they're 1 point less than you thought they were!  
I see what you're saying, but don't forget that a lot of high-end competitive lists will have indirect fire (Thunderfire Cannons, Basilisks, Night Spinners for OP's Eldar) and drones do melt pretty easily to that kind of bolter-esque shooting.  
Other bodyguard units are basically not used competitively, and it's because that rule is trash and doesn't help. Don't bring Shield Drones down, bring other things up to their level.  
Agreed on the codex being trash outside those listed (bar Coldstar/Enforcer/Iridium Commanders). Maybe PA will do better than CA2019 did."
WarhammerCompetitive,fek8wo2,t1_fek7cf8,1579195055.0,"Huh? I don't understand how you're doing your maths for '24+ extra wounds on a 3++ model for only 44 points?'.  
Drones (or at least Tactical Drones) are 10pts each, so 44pts is not an even number of drones.  
The unit cannot take their save before passing the wound off to the drone.   The drone cannot take its save either, only its 5+++. This means 1 wound is reduced to ~2/3 of a wound (on average). The damage of that wound can vary, and yes it turns multi-damage wounds into a single mortal wound (and can save that), but at the same time if you shot at the drones, the multi-damage wound would only kill 1 drone anyway.  
You nerf Shield Drones, you basically destroy the T'au army competitively. T'au are not as easy to play as people make out, there's a good reason people like Richard Siegler have switched to Marines for LVO, there are bigger problems in the game than T'au.  
Having said that, I'm biased towards T'au as an originally T'au player, but the evidence is pretty clear imo."

soccer,feene6o,t1_feekx78,1579037268.0,"Yeah sure. I'd regard Wolves as my 'main' team. As a young kid I liked Cheltenham, and originally only got interested in Wolves because of a girl, but I went in on Wolves hard after she turned out not to be impressed (I don't think she really cared and only said she liked Wolves as it was her Dad's team). Since then I've been a supporter of Wolves and dropped off in my support of Cheltenham, especially after I moved away to Birmingham, then London. I'm now back in my home town, still love Wolves but enjoying going to the more accessible games (I did get to see Charlton v Wolves in the Championship while I was in London though) of my local and hometown team. The two teams arke vastly different in stature and level of play, and I doubt in my lifetime I will see the two teams play in the same league, so I consider Cheltenham as my 'second' team. If they ever meet in the cup, I'd likely support Wolves, hence why my flair is them  
I have actually seen Cheltenham v Wolves, it was a pre-season friendly about 20 years ago now. I was pretty conflicted that day tbh, but now I'm confident I'd support Wolves.  
EDIT: Also of note is that my Dad and brother support Liverpool, my Dad's dad supports Man U and my Dad's step-Dad supported Wolves when he was alive (only died a few year back) as he was from the Black Country, so there's a bit of family differences in football teams and I had a Grandad who supported Wolves, not an unusual choice."

Example of the mix of French and Germanic vocabulary: The word for the animal is pig (derived from Germanic roots, similar to Middle Dutch and German. Also swine, similar to Modern German and Dutch) yet the meat is pork (from French roots, similar to the French 'porc'). This is because after the Norman invasion, the French-speaking Normans (originally Vikings but let's not go into that) installed themselves as the nobility. The meat was largely eaten by the French-speaking nobles but the animals were kept by the English-speaking Anglo-Saxon peasants. Hence the disconnect between the roots of the two words."
