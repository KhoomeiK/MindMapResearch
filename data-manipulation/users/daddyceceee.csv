dankmemes,ff4cwxx,t3_ere2hk,1579560651.0,hey just letting u know that adds to the stigma of having a mental illness! majority of shooters don’t have a diagnosable diagnosis it’s mainly just people with a lack of distress tolerance skills.

depression_memes,ff16b0s,t1_ff110x6,1579475617.0,"yes if u don’t think ur meds are working for u then talk to ur doctor abt it. i was on prozac before n from my personal experience it wasn’t a good time, mainly bc i don’t have depression i have bipolar, not saying that u do tho. but i’ve know a lot of ppl that prozac made them worse i also know ppl who liked prozac. medications are really trial and error and need to be combined with effective therapy. i really like dbt. side note take omega 3’s with EPA as the active ingredient there’s been a lot of studies showing that it helps with mental illness same with antioxidants. best of luck to u!"
