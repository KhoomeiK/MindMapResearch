It doesn't matter if your chosen load of 42.1 grains is actually 42.4 or 41.8 as long as you use the same scale every time you reload. A better test would be to make sure it reads the same from day to day.  

You are using budget scales made by reloading companies and check weights that have no certificates. Here is an example of a calibration weight (https://balance.balances.com/scales/945/): ""50g Class 1 calibration weight with NVLAP Calibration Certificate. The tolerance of this calibration weight is ± 0.12 milligrams."", this costs $137. I am betting RCBS does not use calibration weights of this quality."

This makes detecting a shift in mirage much easier,” said Jarecke. “Also, the reticle has wind holds graduated in 1⁄10-­mil increments, which makes wind calls and wind corrections a highly precise and easily calculated affair.”**

**Jarecke couldn’t stress more the need for 1⁄10-­mil increments. Reticles that are graduated with half-­mil increments make corrections for wind a guesstimation.**

**“If your firing solution calls for a wind correction of .7 mils right, you’d be guessing where that is on a reticle that only shows half-­ or 1-­mil increments,” said Jarecke. “Your wind calls and corrections need to be refined to 1⁄10th of a mil, but this skill does take time and many times instruction to develop a high level of proficiency.”**

&#x200B;

I don't think the H2CMR has .1 MIL hashes. According to the reticle spec from S&B the center of the reticle to center of the hash is .2 MIL and the hash is .03 thick so at best you could hold .015 (Left/Right edge of center line), and .185 (Edge closest to center of the first hash)."
