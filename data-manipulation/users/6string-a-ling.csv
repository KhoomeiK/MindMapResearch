ynab,ffj2pxq,t1_ffi3p1e,1579988900.0,I’m in exactly the same place. Exactly one year in and have def made progress but still not really quite reaching some of the other “quality of life” type goals I’d hoped for. And starting to get there with my emergency fund as well. Little by little. Debt is gone though other than mortgage and I definitely LOVE the freedom of feeling YNAB poor and unstressed. Haha

Coffee,fextpd8,t3_eqrq6z,1579435936.0,I just had onyx for the first time yesterday and it was incredible! Never been to Arkansas but one of my friends just went off to school there and she came back with a bag of Ethiopia and I loved it! She’s a barista at one of the shops!

coffee_roasters,fehi63p,t1_fegj2k7,1579117033.0,"Nice! I used to be all about darker roasts also and in the past couple of years or so have swung more to the more acidic/fruit forward coffees for sure. Oddly enough, my first roast in it, I actually overdid it and it turned out fairly dark haha. I found [this article](https://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/using-sight-to-determine-degree-of-roast) extremely helpful in getting me to the right roast level that I wanted. I watched Sweet Maria’s video about the SR 540 and kind of approach my roasts like that, but I kind of adjust as I go based on temp and such. Overall, I’d say I’m...adequately whelmed? Haha. Not blown away but not disappointed either (except in user error). Better than the coffee I’ve been drinking for the past year or so (was on a stricter budget than normal for a while) but not quite to the level of the great roasters and cafes in my area. But for the bang for buck, I’m stoked to have something that I would even consider 85% as good as what I can buy from those places at roughly 1/3 of the price... Keep dialing it in and you’ll find something you love! Since green coffee is so cheap (relatively), don’t be scared to experiment and start pushing your roasts longer/darker if that’s what you like! Worst case scene it’s horrible and you learn from that and just try again! Also buy some coffee that would lend itself to a darker roasts (a lot of Ethiopian, etc are a little more delicate and don’t hold up so well to roasting darker, whereas some Nicaraguans would fare much better). Happy roasting!!"

coffee_roasters,fedgxjq,t1_fedggfk,1579011225.0,"You would think!! Unfortunately roast smoke is not the most pleasant smell...sort of like burnt popcorn...but the end result, however... it’s usually pretty dissipated by the end of the day though. 

I made this mistake on a trip once for my wife to go to a conference. I found a local coffee shop to work in (I have an element to my work that allows me to work remotely from time to time) that roasted inside the cafe and I was SO pumped because I knew it was going to be amazing! I was pretty surprised to discover when they fired up the roaster (the peak of my excitement) to find just the opposite. Haha. But at least I knew what I was getting into when starting to roast on my own!"
coffee_roasters,fed7ag4,t1_fecsmxc,1579002226.0,"You could check [this](https://www.sweetmarias.com/fresh-roast-sr540.html) one out. I just got it for Christmas and am enjoying it so far!

coffee_roasters,fe7oar7,t1_fe7hjut,1578917381.0,"No problem! I’d suggest poking around on Sweet Maria’s a little bit, too. Depending on your budget, they have some other, more high-end roasters, too. And a lot of great info on roasting in general. But this one seemed like a good entry-level one to try it out."
ynab,fe7nq64,t3_entzez,1578917128.0,"I had the exact same thing happen to me a few months ago where about 10-15 transactions “uncategorized” themselves somehow. My guess is that’s what happened to you, too. Not that it re-imported transactions, but that it wanted you to categorize them again. Which is why your TBB went uo when you deleted them... I submitted a support ticket but in the meantime I just went back and tried to remember best I could what categories they were, but it was definitely a pain and I didn’t get it all right. I just left the categories wonky in previous months and adjusted in the month I was in and it all balances out at least. It was super frustrating but that was my fix. Unfortunately since y’all deleted the transactions I’m not sure what to tell you now...unless you’re on web and still have that tab open and can undo until they’re back maybe?"
coffee_roasters,fe7g4kr,t1_fe7fd5x,1578914210.0,I have loved it so far! It’s about 140g of green coffee I’d say. So a little less. More like 5? But I’m the only coffee drinker in my house so I only need to roast about twice a week

coffee_roasters,fe7flt5,t1_fe2kaky,1578913976.0,Not too much! Like $190. It’s called the FreshRoast SR 540. You can get it on [amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RT6S5YH/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_1.ehEbZZA4HXY) but I would maybe suggest [Sweet Maria’s](https://www.sweetmarias.com/fresh-roast-sr540.html) because it’s basically the same price and comes with 4 lbs of green coffee!

Was a bigger Falcons fan but couldn’t afford the tickets in those days haha. You could get into a thrashers game for like 10 bucks. It was awesome. In hindsight it was probably that cheap bc they were struggling to sell tickets and that’s why they sold the team
ynab,fdsst81,t1_fdr8dd1,1578707484.0,Definitely not haha. I wish. Not even close. We only tithe when paychecks come in. I own. Y business and only pay myself at the beginning of the month.

ynab,fdp3yje,t1_fdp1mk7,1578619437.0,You’re not wrong!

ynab,fdp3qhx,t1_fdoye0w,1578619286.0,Yeah honestly that’s kind of the long and short of it but there’s so much about the mindset you have to have in order to really achieve it. That’s what he does really well imo is put you in the frame of mind to know that you can actually achieve that and gives actionable steps to help you get there. Sounds like you kind of know the plan of attack but are still interested in some sort of program if it’s the right fit? What are your goals and what are you hoping to get out of something like that?

ynab,fdp3ecp,t1_fdoybmt,1578619056.0,"I definitely like it. I’m a Christian, so I’m down with the “religious interjections” but even if I weren’t, I could see past it to get to the vital info. You can get it from his radio show (also a podcast now) but having it in such a clear, direct, and consecutive order is pretty beneficial as well.
