depression,fez17tv,t3_eqtm7u,1579452962.0,"I’m so grateful for him being apart of my life, but I have tried to get with others... my body rejects it to the point to where I’m literally asexual...it’s like my body refuses to seek anyone now. It’s really fucked up, man."
depression,fexdeqy,t1_fex4pg5,1579429130.0,"My ex was trans and I don’t believe I truly stopped loving him; however, the reality of them having moved on is haunting. Regardless of me possibly rationalizing loneliness in itself due to loneliness doesn’t dismiss my feelings and my perpetual desire of death. This is my reality. I’m unable to live with this anymore regardless of the countless hours of treatment. I’m sorry to rant the end of a human being on here, but I feel this might help the world in a positive way as I believe my existence being erased may just benefit society for the best..."

depression,fczeqrj,t3_eji660,1578099559.0,"People aren’t attracted to negative energy, but no one wants to see you hurt. Nobody is perfect, but to combat my depression heres what I do! I’m friendly to everyone I meet and when we have conversations, I try my best to relate if possible. I won’t force myself to relate because I’m not a fake person. I’ve made friends with people from all different personalities, places and it’s easy. I believe that I should treat everyone with respect and kindness because I just don’t know what they’ve gone through or going through. I’ve been to some dark places in my life and no one knew about it so I know we can keep some really dark secrets. I want to flood myself with always working towards acquiring my dreams and happiness. In my depressive states, I redirect that energy into writing and use it to motivate myself in some other hobbies as well! Don’t let it control you, you’re running this show! You’re the main character in YOUR story!! I’ve made friends with all of my co-workers despite their own animosity towards each other. That said, I really hope you make the best of friends and can find happiness! ☺️"
