Was browsing and got an update error notice, couldn't install, said there was a critical need, download full version, click here to download latest.  OK.

I go, click the download button; the dmg mounts; the drag to Applications window opens (ooo, different logo); so I Trash the old version, drag the new over, then fire it up from the Dock.

Interesting.  File menu says, Waterfox Current, instead of Waterfox.  Hmm?  

Hey, my Bookmarks toolbar is missing.  So I command+shift+B, and all I see are the stock set of WF linx.  Huh?

OK, this is freaky, let's go to Reddit and... I'm not logged in?   There's no saved PW for ... anything?  /queue momentary panic

OK, deep breath.  Let's check the Library.  Sure enough, two profiles.  So I copy the name of newest, rename newest, paste name over previous profile folder, fire it up and ...

Down drops a box asking if I want to use Current profile or Previous profile.  I chose Previous. 

Passwords are back, so are bookmarks, but not all extensions, and not custom dictionary.  Dunno for sure, but maybe I was running Classic and pulled down Current?  :(  

Any way, the About now says 2020.0.1 (64 bit) WF Current and the File menu say WF Current, so I guess I'm good.  :)

One other oddity, this version may be behaving badly with a window manager I use (WindowMizer) as I no longer have the default buttons on the upper left to close, minimize and maximize the browser window.

“What Does the Constitution Actually Say About Voting Rights - Or, how the Shelby ruling is like starving a dog to death

GARRETT EPPS
AUGUST 19, 2013

Since the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder in June, conservative governments in the South and elsewhere have raced to introduce new voting restrictions. Most prominent in the attacks is the comprehensive vote-restriction law passed by the Republican majority in the North Carolina legislature. The law cuts back early voting, restricts private groups from conducting voter-registration drives, eliminates election-day voter registration, and imposes the strictest voter ID rules in the country. There is evidence that Republican legislatures elsewhere will follow North Carolina's lead.

Neither the American people nor the federal courts would tolerate restrictions of this sort if they were imposed on free speech, free assembly, freedom of religion, or freedom to petition government for redress of grievances. For that matter, many Southern states--and probably a majority of the Supreme Court--would reject far less onerous restrictions on the right to ""keep and bear arms."" Yet each of those rights is mentioned only once in the Constitution. The ""right to vote"" is mentioned five times--and yet the Court has brushed it aside as a privilege that states may observe at their convenience. Even an overwhelming majority of Congress--which is given the power to enforce the right in no fewer than four different places in the Constitution--cannot protect this right more strongly than the Court feels appropriate.”"

When they killed that connector, I was forced to use analog *and* depending on the vendor, was now subject to random “USB accessory not supported errors” because the affordable options may or may not fully comply with the MFI BS.
