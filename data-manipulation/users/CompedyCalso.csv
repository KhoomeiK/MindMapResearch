AskReddit,fggzr5p,t3_ey9qbh,1580773276.0,"Doom: Annihilation.

The original Doom movie with Dwayne Johnson was bad, but at least it was its own thing. But Annihilation straight up insults Doom fans. They constantly keep making references to the games that end up getting annoying: the A.I is called ""Daisy,"" and one of the characters makes the same ""Ultra-Nightmare"" joke MULTIPLE TIMES because ""tHe GamEs hAvE UlRa NiGgTmArE MoDe GeDDit xD."" They even manage to insult Wolfenstein fans when one of the dead scientists is called Blazkowicz and they keep saying his GODDAMN NAME. Doom: Annihilation just proves that movies based on games never turn out well."

BoJackHorseman,fg63iap,t1_fg61fbh,1580551678.0,"I really liked how they ended this.

If they ended with Bojack's death, I feel it would have been too cliche. Bojack falls back into another cycle and ODs; it's what we all would expect. And he doesn't have to deal with the ramifications of his actions. The audience would feel sad for a while then move on.

But with this ending, we see the meaning behind the show: life just goes on. Most of the people closest to Bojack cut ties with him and move on: Todd shares one more nice moment with him on the beach, PC has one more dance with him, and Diane shares one more moment with him on the roof, even of it's in complete silence. And Bojack, whether or not he falls back into his vicious cycle, just has to move on. And the audience is left with a bittersweet ending: life doesn't always give us closure. Life's a bitch, and we keep on living. Time's arrow waits for no one, it merely marches forward."

AskReddit,fg5gjah,t3_ewqv5v,1580526865.0,"Hooooo boy, the Star Wars sequel trilogy is holier than the Vatican. Here goes:

- How did the first order gain control of the whole galaxy at the start of Episode 8? At the start of Episode 7, the First Order used Starkiller Base as a way to rule over the galaxy using fear, and you would think its destruction by the Resistance would help rally more planets to their cause. Yet when Last Jedi starts, the First Order has complete and total control over the Galaxy? Did I miss something?

- Luke Skywalker sees the good in Darth Vader, one of the most evil people in the galaxy, and tries to bring him back to the light. Yet Ben Solo, who at the time was training under Luke, only *SHOWED* dark side tendencies, never acted upon them yet, and Luke saw that as reason enough to try and kill him?

- Why didn't Captain Pink Hair tell Poe Dameron her escape plan? The First Order is nipping at their heels, Poe is trying to save the lives of his friends and fellow soldiers, and she knows how hot headed and impulsive he can be. Yet she still tries to keep her plan a secret from him because..... WHY?!?!

- How did that dagger in Episode 9 align PERFECTLY with the Death Star wreckage? None of the debris would have eroded over all that time? Not to mention the gigantic waves that would shift and move the wreckage.

- On that note, how did Kylo Ren escape that water planet? Rey stole his ship and destroyed it, and Poe and Finn took the Millennium Falcon. How did he escape the planet, much less the piece of debris he was on with such a storm around him?

- How did Emperor Palpatine survive the Death Star explosion, and WHY would he broadcast his revenge plan over the radio. Not to mention, if surviving Empire soldiers were hunted down after the war, how were millions of them able to get to the Sith Planet without attracting attention? 

- If planet-destroying technology could be miniaturized to fit a Star Destroyer, then what's the point of the Death Stars and Starkiller Base?

- In Last Jedi, Kylo Ren told Rey that her parents were nobodies who just sold her off for some coin. Yet in Rise of Skywalker he changes his mind and says that she is of Palpatine's blood? In that case who is Palpatine's wife? Who is his son and why isn't he Force-Sensitive?"

AskReddit,ffue8ip,t3_ev5zdg,1580240113.0,"Just a few weeks ago. Thoughts just started flooding to me: I'm a failure. I went to high school in a gifted program, and I was smart and showing great promise. I was three years into university when I got major depression and dropped out because I just couldn't take the pressure. My friends who I went to high school with are all graduated and onto very promising jobs in their fields. And here I am, working at Starbucks, 24 years old, flat broke, spending my time playing video games and surfing reddit rather than fix my life. I had so much promise and I messed up badly. I just laid in my bed and let the existential dread wash over me."
