getdisciplined,fe1jnap,t1_fdx7ks1,1578827359.0,It's possible you're getting lost in thought a lot during your sessions. It's good to think about why you've chosen to invest this bit of time into meditation before sitting down and doing it. Also try out the Waking Up app

getdisciplined,fd2wjk1,t1_fd2tkat,1578152274.0,"I've actually been journaling every day for the last 3 months and journaling on-and-off for several years. I write about a lot of those things you mentioned. Generally just how things are going, how yesterday went, what a good day looks like today. If it's the first of the month, I'll talk about the previous month and the upcoming one. I keep my ongoing to-do list on there too. I use MS OneNote for this. Makes it easy to integrate journal entries and the to-do list into the same place.

Definitely helps with staying centered, and most importantly, not having to keep my plans and tasks in my head. If it's written down, I don't have to keep it in working memory."
getdisciplined,fd278o6,t1_fd1viss,1578142783.0,"Sorry but I really can't answer that. I didn't just go straight from nothing to a consistent practice - plus I first started dabbling in this about 18 years ago.

Try this: Download the Waking Up app. You get the first 5 days of the course for free. Do those 5 days in a row. I think they're about 5 minutes each. After those 5 days, you'll know if it's making a difference."
MapPorn,fd1mvge,t1_fcyz4iw,1578133544.0,"Not a walk in the park by any means, but winning a conventional war is all about air superiority, and no nation on Earth has the tools to put up any kind of competitive fight against American air power.

Occupation / exit strategy is the tricky part. Military force vs. military force would not be competitive."
getdisciplined,fd1d9y2,t1_fd1camy,1578130117.0,"Yep there are a lot of activities that are definitely forms of meditation. Yoga is the first one that comes to mind. Running, walking, hiking, playing sports, gardening. Yeah I think cooking too, especially during moments when we don't have to think about what to do."
getdisciplined,fd1bqen,t1_fd0xtii,1578129520.0,"As soon as I tried asking myself ""I wonder what my next thought is going to be"", I felt it. That's technically not a meditation session, just a quick moment of silencing the voice in my head and experiencing reality in a truer form."
getdisciplined,fd1amk0,t1_fd00xfr,1578129238.0,"Thoughts arise whether we like it or not, and we don't choose those thoughts either. We can recognize them for what they are though. Just thoughts that arise on their own. Just like sounds that come and go. They enter consciousness and then they leave. Those thoughts are only as powerful as we allow them to be. Without training, they'll dominate our experience of life, all day long."
getdisciplined,fd00av2,t1_fczy0l6,1578111694.0,"Close your eyes and cover your breath with your attention. If you get lost in thought, just come back to the breath. If you're new then you probably won't be able to go for long periods of time without getting lost in thought. And that's ok. Just do a couple minutes every day if you can.

There are lots of different methods but this is a good one to start with."
getdisciplined,fczz486,t1_fcyji4h,1578111126.0,"Indeed, it's pretty crazy how effective it is. I think it can solve a lot of important problems for people and only at the cost of several minutes a day."
getdisciplined,fczstu0,t1_fcymh12,1578108021.0,Awesome!
getdisciplined,fczsssk,t1_fcz0oja,1578108007.0,Awesome! Yeah it's all about taking some kind of action and meditation is certainly a good action to take
getdisciplined,fczsf22,t1_fcz1i83,1578107822.0,"The Waking Up app is great. Sam Harris has a great voice due guided meditation, he has a knack for articulating concepts that are inherently difficult to put into words, and the 50 day course taught me a lot of valuable things, even as someone who had been dabbling in meditation for years."
getdisciplined,fczs4t9,t1_fcz1tcf,1578107689.0,"The Power of Now was my first introduction to it. As I was reading it, it rang so true to me and knew it was worth pursuing.

Well all of us meditate from time to time, whether we realize it or not. Ever see a beautiful view for the first time, and just stop thinking for a few seconds as you take it in? That's meditation."
getdisciplined,fcy3ih1,t1_fcxx17a,1578074284.0,"Try it first thing in the morning.

I'm trying to get more consistent about my morning routine: Get up without checking notifications on my phone, drink water, go to the bathroom if I have to, and then meditate before anything else.

e: to add to this I'd ask the question, what makes for a more productive day? 8 hours of work, or 10 minutes of meditation + 7 hours and 50 minutes of work?"
getdisciplined,fcxkx9j,t1_fcxjo8r,1578065435.0,"Paying attention to the breath is the most basic method. It is effective, but there are plenty more. You can keep your eyes open and pay attention to your visual field, while trying not to assign labels to objects or form judgements or opinions of them. It's just colors and shapes. You can close your eyes and pay attention to your visual field. It's dark but there are colors and shapes there. You can listen to sounds, you can pay attention to the sensations in your body - pressure, temperature, tingling. The Waking Up app is great for learning all of these and more.

Sometimes I'll just ask myself ""I wonder what my next thought is going to be"" and I'll get into a meditative state immediately, at least for a moment."
getdisciplined,fcxiqtu,t1_fcxeplo,1578063943.0,"Also I get what you mean about being a thinker. I'm that way too. I enjoy analyzing and strategizing. But there's a time and a place for it. If I'm spending time at a beach to relax, or spending time with a friend or loved one, I want to be fully present rather than thinking about my plans and so on. Especially if I've already thought those things and worked out that strategy already. Repeating the same thoughts over and over is so useless. Sam Harris says that if the voice in his head was a person, it would be the most boring person in the world. Most of the time it's just repeating the same things and stating the obvious."
getdisciplined,fcxicmg,t1_fcxeplo,1578063665.0,"Maybe try out the Waking up app, there's a 50 day course on there that hits this topic from a lot of different angles. Different perspectives about meditation, different forms of it, techniques to try. It's a paid app but you get 5 days for free."
getdisciplined,fcxhzor,t1_fcxbs8f,1578063407.0,"I'm not qualified to give advice about this but I'll give it a shot. You've got some shit buried in your subconscious. We all do, to some extent. Traumatic events from your past, things you learned when you were younger and accepted as true, whether they really were or not. That sort of thing. It needs to be dug out and faced head on. This is a big part of why therapy works, and there are some guided meditations designed for this too. It's very heavy and it gets emotional but in the long run it's for the better."
getdisciplined,fcxayfl,t1_fcx9fer,1578057812.0,"2 years is a really solid shot to give - I'm no expert so I won't try to diagnose the problem but in a way I feel like it MUST work if it's being done properly. It's a form of focus training, and you could say that at its core, mindfulness is simply an absence of distraction. You didn't notice any change with clarity, awareness, how you respond to things throughout the day, or how you perceive things?"
worldnews,fcwcf4s,t1_fcw4az3,1578022171.0,"On a different scale than Iraq, yes, but the US would still achieve air superiority immediately and put Iran's entire navy at the bottom of the ocean in a matter of hours."
