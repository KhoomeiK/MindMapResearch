The strike is the equivalent of Russia deciding it's had enough of the Navy Seals, and so strikes at the US Secretary of Defense by blowing up the Paris airport on grounds that the US covertly supported the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan in 1979 \[a group of stateless actors that happened to hate the same people the US did\], spinning it through state media that the Seals are a terrorist organization no different from ISIS and therefore it's perfectly legal and cool.

Iran has four options, and none of them good.  Take it to the UN (demand sanctions, which the US will ignore and most European powers are unlikely to enforce so as to not poke the bear, escalating tensions), take it to the ICC (demand a trial in an international court of law...see above), do nothing (face revolt within its borders *and* encourage more strikes from the US by showing it has no consequences, escalating tensions), or declare war/retaliate \[escalating to open conflict between the two nations\].

When a NATO country goes to war, generally the rest of the world does not stand idly by.  Our allies, and Iran's allies, will be pressured to take sides and get involved.  Those that do get involved make the conflict bigger, which in turn ratchets up the pressure on those still fence-sitting to get involved and make the conflict even bigger.  Those that don't get branded traitors, potentially attacked by their allies, and if they do would make the conflict bigger.

There are plenty of reasons SR5 deserves to be on the list, but it's a good thing to be mindful of the biases too.

Personally, even in the face of its faults I would use Shadowrun to play Shadowrun...the Sherpa-breaking dice pools and mechanical absurdities like 'Chunky Salsa' are as much a part of the game's identity as the setting itself, something the 'PBtA ALL THE THINGS!' crowd is IMO too quick to overlook...but at this point would only do so after making an earnest effort to clean up 5E's mess.  I remain convinced that there is a great game, a much-needed refinement of 3E's rules, a much-needed learning from the hard lessons of 4E, and a setting update that manages to fold in all the cool SR-appropriate shit that didn't exist when it was first written \[like AR\] without abandoning its roots as retro-futuristic 80s kitsch somewhere in that 475-page train wreck of a book.

I love the game, and have since my very first session of any game ever \[SR3 was my first RPG\]...but absolutely despise the 5E core book.  At this point I'm certain that Catalyst's biggest problem is its 'army of freelancers' production model.  That is not a slight against the freelancers themselves, and I can't stress that enough...the criticism starts and ends as an admission that it's orders of magnitude harder to maintain a clear, consistent, and unified design direction, harder to make sure everyone involved considers the big picture of how those decisions will affect parts other people are working on, when everyone is off doing their own thing with insufficient supervision because nobody is under the same roof and the writer-to-editor ratio is off-kilter.  On the whole the 5E book feels like a giant ball of band-aids, ugly hacks tying together things that are themselves tied together with ugly hacks because changes from 4E left gaping holes in the mechanics (such as introducing Limits, but not updating the Minimum Successes to reflect the smaller 'typical' dice pools) or pieces were developed without consideration for how they'll interplay with other pieces \[the interplay between Decking, Wireless, and 'Combat Deckers', I'm looking at you...\].

I also really liked 3rd Ed.  It was a FASA game through and through, with everything that implied...both Jordan being, if you'll pardon the pun, a Wizkid of a game designer and being a heavy system originating in an era ruled by the Avalon Hill school of 'simulation first' design...but that's why I adore it.

Shit's crunchier than a bowl of grape nuts.

\-------------

Getting back to that whole 'if it's justified' thing, I'm gonna pick on wargame/RPG hybrid Car Wars here, because it makes a great example.  How do you crash your car in Car Wars?

>When you take, or are the target of, any action that reduces your Handling Status, even if you have already done so this turn, immediately consult the Control Table; Find the correct cell in the Speed / Handling Status matrix that denotes whether you are Safe, Automatically Crash, or must Roll to Maintain Control.  If the lattermost, Roll 1D6 and you must meet or beat the specified number.  If you succeed, no further action.  If you fail the roll or Automatically Crash, consult the Crash Roll Modifiers Table.  Roll 2D6 and add the relevant modifiers (such as for Speed, the amount of Handling Status lost by the action that caused the control roll, any relevant Equipment on the car, and your character's Driving Skill). Then consult the Crash Type Table to determine which of two Crash Tables to compare the 2D6 result to, and follow the instructions in the relevant row of the correct Crash Table, which may need to be applied on this and successive turns.  The relevant row will denote when Control of the car is regained, which may be during the 'cleanup' phase at the end of the 5-phase turn or may require passing a separate roll, remaining Out of Control until said roll is passed or the car comes to a complete stop.

As much as I enjoy the game (so much so I have my own [3D Arena](https://i.imgur.com/gLrUoit.jpg) for the convention circuit, and have spent years creating [improved game aids](https://i.imgur.com/bsLFuko.jpg)), what the crashing procedures add to the game do not 'pay for' the cost of their complexity, the time lost to their complexity, and the intimidation their complexity impresses upon new players.  I understand the history of it, I know why it's there and why it operates the way it does (Car Wars was, like many of the wargames and wargame hybrids released from the late 70s through mid-90s, built on the tropes and genre conventions established by Avalon Hill), but I eagerly look forward to 6th Edition which reduces all that to:

>Whenever you perform a Maneuver, roll \[speed\]D-Yellow plus the indicated dice.  Take 1 point of Tire Damage for each Wrench symbol.  Pay 1 Control Token for each Shield symbol.  If you run out of Control Tokens, you gain the 'Out of Control' status until the start of the next turn, with all associated penalties.  If you must pay more Control Tokens than you have, you also 'Spin Out' by 1 'slice' on the maneuver stick for each one you cannot pay.  If you must pay 5 or more, your car is immediately totaled and out of the game.

Still takes 4 lines in the editor to explain...but it reduces a 2-5 minute process down to a single dice roll, and as such is something that 'pays for itself' with plenty of wiggle room to spare.

Or to use an RPG example...the 'Advantage' system of 5e vs the Arbitrary +/-2 of 3.5e.  I went into 5th edition wary, expecting the loss of granularity to take something that was genuinely fun \[rewarding creative approaches with bonuses to a roll, and more creative = more bonus\] and 'dumb it down' to a simple 'yes/no'...but looking back I do not miss arbitrary +/-2 at all.  It wasn't a bad mechanic, but it was a heavier mechanic than it needed to be.

""Needed to be"".  I suppose that's the crux of it all.  I don't mind complicated systems, or involved rulesets...I find the 'translate this setting to a universal system' aspect of Mekton to be very enjoyable, and while I have plenty of beefs with Shadowrun (one of this sub's favorite punching bags) it remains one of my favorite games.

AmItheAsshole,fct2p45,t3_ei9igg,1577931317.0,"I had anger issues as a teenager myself...a lack of coping skills, combined with some very stressful circumstances \[divorce, abuse, the works\] was not a pretty situation, so I'm really glad to hear you've got him in therapy and everything else.

Laughing in his face is a dick move \[though I'm inclined to believe the stress break explanation\], but this is absolutely a teaching moment: ""Play stupid games, win stupid prizes""...or less cheekily, consequences.  He doesn't have a chair to play in now?  Well, that's motivation to take therapy more seriously, to be more conscious of welling emotions, and to show the discipline to walk away before they end up out of control.  If he was more cognizant, he could have seen the anger coming, hesitated, said 'no', and walked away from the source of rage.

I'm genuinely surprised you allowed him to keep playing this long though, given he's in therapy for anger issues and the genre is a clear trigger thereof."

Delirium Tremens does not fuck around.  Habitual heavy drinkers need medical oversight to wean off."
