politics,ffe8if1,t1_ffe8efg,1579839600.0,Same. And point out every last time a republican knowingly lied about something. And spread it as much as possible.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffd3rtj,t1_ffctpt8,1579812851.0,"You've implied about as much. Does you masters in economics help you understand what an implication is? I think it's hilarious you think i'm white and will bomb the shit out of me for saying what i'm saying while at the same time implying that people only like em because he's white.

This is the reason the black community continously ends up with famous black men that the second someone is killed because they are black they seat at the table the fuck out of the rest of the black community.

I bet you don't even know kendrick lamar respectability politics cops shooting black people. And yet you'll champion yourself as being good about race.

That's where your age comes into play. You didn't even exist through many of rap's turns. Haven't seen how it modeled itself after each and every generation. Getting further and further away from what it started out as until very recently (the last ten years) it finally got back to lyrics meaning something with underground rappers (black and white), battle rappers and those supporting them in quite.

Meanwhile drake took up the general mantle and didn't even write his own stuff.

Enjoy the downvotes i'm getting. Just because people agree with you it doesn't mean you're correct. Now excuse me while i go back to watching the impeachment trail. Something else you don't even care to know exists."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffd34c8,t1_ffcur2e,1579812480.0,"Mumble rap is when the lyrics not only don't but can't make sense. When context of said bars no longer matters above the flow of the presentation.

And no. Black people still listen to rap. Just like human beings still exist who listen to classical music.

I was speaking in general. And generally speaking for a long time black people who listened to rap no longer cared about lyrics making sense or meaning anything.

And again. So what? Does white people enjoying a genre of music along with black people mean it's automatically not what it used to be?"

You do. Clearly.

>Have you been to any of their concerts?

The fuck does that have to do with anything? Lets say i didn't. How does that make me wrong that for a minute there we black people stopped giving a shit about lyrics and only cared about the flow?

>They are mostly white. Hip hop is the biggest genre in the world and specially in America. America is mostly white so naturally they’ve been pushing what’s mainstream. So whatever artist you name most of their fans will be white.

And? Are you saying that because white people like something it sucks? Because you just nuked every rapper, singer, comic book, movie, tv show etc you like personally with your moronic attempt at logic.

>So you saying this shit of Black people ruining hip hop and there’s white saviors or some shit not only is a reflection of racism but ignorance of hip hop culture and the reality it is in today. 

No. I'm saying that not only did we black people give up on the core of what makes rap rap but that em was able to succeed because he kept the core of what makes rap rap. Meanwhile all the black artists that jumped on the pay attention to only the flow are no where to be found.

Every last one that came out when em did disappeared because it wasn't real rap. And after. And even now many black rappers who have no idea why lyrics and bars matter last about as long as a nut shot from donald trump.

Matter of fact. We even have black people in the black community who support a black man who literally said slavery seems like a choice. But who refuse to bang with em because they're afraid he'll harm the black community.

>and there’s white saviors or some shit not only is a reflection of racism but ignorance of hip hop culture and the reality it is in today. 

Yeah, you made that up. Because you don't have an argument. And aren't old enough to have fully experienced how rap has changed over the years. Which is cool. Name one battle rapper. Right.

>Lastly, to write a broad stroke over a group of artist is always going to be ignorant.

And yet you think it's cool to imply that just because white people like something or someone then it sucks. Right. Your diaper is leaking."

Oh and yeah, he did sell because he was white. At the time he came out there was a mixing of all kinds of music. He stuck it out though because he's one of the best.

politics,ff9s1eo,t1_ff9r478,1579719936.0,Yup. That's why we need no matter which way this goes. Even though we know how it will. For every last american to not only fact check all of the impeachment hearings but to spread that fact checking as much as possible.

And this is where you went the wrongest. Just because a group of people haven't and done target you specifically it doesn't mean they don't exist.

After spending a good while talking about politics. There are without a doubt such a thing as bernie bros. I've seen them be sexist and racist. Accidentally of course but they fell directly into it from being overly passionate about bernie sanders. So much so that bernie himself had to tell his supporters to chill out.

>She all but openly called him a mysoginist,

That was a lie. I just re-read the post and nothing like that was said."
politics,ff7upyv,t1_ff7ug3j,1579658818.0,I know right. lol
politics,ff7nuz8,t1_ff7mxaj,1579654035.0,"No. She would make that money no matter what. If the people who support her now even after all the lies from all directions they won't be stopping any time soon.

We're talking her being investigated multiple times by republicans costing i have no idea how much money each time. She doesn't care, you don't care and most people don't really care. The only reason this is making any news what so ever is because people love bernie.

It's not about beating trump because the impeachment hearing is happen right now and you're putting effort into this. Not about winning against trump because bernie supporters say all the time he doesn't need any help what so ever.

She doesn't lose anything and doesn't gain anything because a good 2/3 of the country already hates her guts now. Both because of trump and because of bernie.

So no. It just doesn't matter."
politics,ff7hjul,t1_ff7hb3z,1579649702.0,"No, it is defensible because she said if. You guys hate her so much that even when she leaves the possibility of supporting bernie open you still blast her as having already said she wouldn't.

Hell, she was talking in the past tense about bernie to begin with. Which was all true. You guys will ignore that too."
politics,ff7hegq,t1_ff7gvn8,1579649605.0,"He's more popular than even that. And he is that popular because he was painted as the under dog at any and all costs. Even when it wasn't true.

So of course you would have rejoined had she. Why should she though? Does her opinion matter to you really? No. No it doesn't. You only care about bernie getting support. And nothing else.

How do i know? Again, clinton kicked major ass against trump. And only lost because republicans had been manipulating the out of state lines.

And i'm 100% you have no idea how much ass she did in fact kick. How much stuff she flat out predicted. How many of her plans would have worked and helped people. Etc.

So why? Why should she when again all you care about is bernie and nothing and no one else? Right. There was no reason to. She's been made into the worst politician to ever exist on the democrat side. And no one like you gives a shit. Why should she?"
politics,ff7fb3p,t1_ff7e12b,1579648225.0,">Who cares if 2/3 of people will hate her either way?

You do. If she hadn't said this odds are good you would have had something else negative to say. The damage has been done toward her. She could say not drinking bleach is a good idea and people would somehow say it's about bernie.

Again, she said IF. And people don't give a shit about that word. People already say she gave us trump even though she won the popular vote. Even though republicans have been beating the hell out of gerrymandering for decades now.

It doesn't matter what she says until it seems she's saying something bad about berine. During the debates she flat out stuck trump with his own bullshit and predicted everything currently happening with his impeachment but people will still say she didn't have what it took to do anything.

Yeah. People just love to hate her."
politics,ff7f0u4,t1_ff7dlec,1579648039.0,"I didn't mean clinton's impeachment. I meant getting the fbi to investigate hillary clinton. That they found that by lying enough to the right people they could get an investigation going for no reason that would hurt their enemies.

There were no hey..republicans lie so maybe we should reconsider believing them about everything they've said about her. She's not running again. Ever. And possibly will never be in government ever again.

She knows that. The people who supported her to begin with know that. So why exactly should she help anyone at any point after all that?

Again, no matter what she says or doesn't say a good 2/3 of the country would have said she was wrong no matter what. So why give a shit? Why not speak freely? Isn't that what you like about bernie or trump?

She didn't open the door for anything. That shit has been wide open since people believed the lie that she and the dnc cheated bernie.

If. She said if. And most of what else she said is true. No one wanted to touch bernie before he ran. No one in office. Because it would have meant certain immediate death for their jobs, career and campaigns. How he ran only he could have pulled off. Not him and someone else. That's just the way america is.

It is partly his fault. For believing in republican lies blindly. Same goes for many of his supporters. From campaign funds, wallstreet meetings to emails and people saying she didn't have a plan.

facepalm,fdkmtx7,t1_fdk9ojo,1578506836.0,How can neither be ideal when everyone does it and has done it since the beginning of politics?
Trumpgret,fdkms36,t1_fdkc39h,1578506803.0,I said it could be that.
Trumpgret,fdk35sv,t1_fdk31c4,1578494923.0,And you're still manipulating things. You ran away so no harm done.
infp,fdk1yyl,t3_elll91,1578494067.0,"Yeah but looking at your love as if it can run out like waters means it can run out like water. Saying you don't have enough left for yourself means you won't have enough left for yourself.

And right from the start you've gone wrong. Out of everyone you should have unlimited love for yourself. You should be your own best friend.

Also, loving yourself generally is a cliche because people don't explain what it is or how to do it. Giving yourself a break, understanding yourself as much as you can, understanding that faults will happen no matter how much you try not to have them but that as long as you aren't trying to be faulty there's still always a chance to be better, that loving yourself means being critical of yourself, being able to enjoy yourself when no one else is around and a whole mess of other stuff.

One other thing i think people should know is that we human beings will never be completely consistent with anything or anyone. We will make mistakes. And those mistakes can be and sometimes will be huge. As long as we're still at the very least trying we will still be better for it."

AskReddit,fdk15rj,t3_elq6wb,1578493480.0,Made an error when it comes to statistics not too long ago on reddit. Pretty sure it'll have more than a few magats creaming their pants. So after admitting to the mistake i'm gonna let it go.
facepalm,fdk0rb7,t1_fdju07l,1578493186.0,"Yeah identity politics was never considered bad. Until that is black people, women, gay people, etc started getting the right to vote. All of a sudden voting in your own best interests if you are in fact in those groups became a bad thing while white people voting in their own best interests from the first time white people could vote up until now wasn't and isn't."
facepalm,fdk0jr7,t1_fdjrnga,1578493031.0,"*Sigh*. No, everything about identity politics is everything about being progressive. It's also everything about being liberal. It's also everything about being conservative. Everything about being libertarian. And everything having to do with politics.

Everyone is guilty of identity politics.

>Identity politics is a political approach and analysis based on people prioritizing the concerns most relevant to their particular racial, religious, ethnic, sexual, social, cultural or other identity, and forming exclusive political alliances with others of this group, instead of engaging in more traditional, broad-based party politics.[1]

Name anyone who votes in their own best interests and you have someone who has something to do with identity politics."
facepalm,fdk0b1h,t1_fdjum0y,1578492846.0,Yes. It was indeed started by black people. It may not have been intended to stay that way but black people did start it.
facepalm,fdk08hx,t1_fdjjlgc,1578492792.0,"What? So other people have to and should stop trying to help others because a bunch of morons know that it isn't people of color saying a thing but are trying to attach it to people of color anyway because they are in fact racists? lol

No, that particular thing hasn't ever been a real thing but dog whistle politics has always been a thing."
