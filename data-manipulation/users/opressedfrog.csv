Sadly, grief over a lost relationship is apart of the process through the 7 stages. 

Being with someone for 3 years is quite a long time to be with someone and to have it abruptly taken from you hurts. 

The best way to get through this is to take a deep breath and slowly block everything you’ve shared with her out of your life. If you hold anything that was once hers, promptly get rid of it. 

Any pictures should go too. Don’t hold onto things that would remind you of something.

The breaking point was when my friend was there to give me support after he found someone else, and then we’d trash talk him and she would slip in reasons why him being gone was a good thing.

When you get into one the s/o makes it so fucking easy for you to feel like you need them, that you need to rely on them or you won’t be able to survive in life. It’s like they slowly groom you until they brainwash you into being with them. 

They become very controlling, almost parental with you. Force you to think like their word is the word of god. And eventually you spiral into this highly anxious controlled system, where everything they say you need to listen to.

Catswhoyell,fdps0aa,t1_fdprp5w,1578638239.0,"This too, but after working with cats at our spca I’ve learned a couple of tricks that helped me get close to even the most meanest cats.  

It’s always good to just sit on the floor and let them come to you. Don’t really pay them much attention, scroll through your phone. Just do something that makes you not look threatening. Especially don’t move around a lot. 

If you need to get up, get up as slow as possible, don’t make any sudden movements that might scare them or make them jumpy. And then slowly but carefully walk out the door. 

Usually if you sit on the floor and allow them to sniff you, that’s when you put your hand out and let them smell it. If they want to be pet, they usually give the sign and headbutt it. BUT Never go past their neck because it’s closer to the more “sensitive bits” until they are fully comfortable with you. 

After that, then go for more “typical” cat pets like scratching their back, giving them butt pats. The usual. 

Sorry for leaving a long winded comment but it’s just some information I feel is useful for those who don’t really know what to do in certain situations."

As a woman, most like men who don’t sit and whine about how they’re such a nice guy, that “they’re so nice” and brag about how good they’d treat them. It’s an instant turn off. Or, like you’re doing, trying to point out why women only date a certain kind of man. 

You can NOT group all women into one giant pile claiming we all like a certain type of guy. 

Instead of sitting in a one person circle jerk, complaining at 33 years old on why you’re undatable, maybe you should get some kind of ambition and actually figure out why a woman won’t date you. 

Because at this point I can see exactly why you’re still single."

Just enjoy being single most of your life until you realize how wrong you are."

Remember, being nice isn’t a personality trait. 

I can tell you right now by no means is attractiveness something that has ever caught my attention. A good personality gets you somewhere. 

You could be the most attractive person and have the worst personality. Ugly personalities equal an even uglier person. 

Wealth and status do not equal attractiveness. Again, a good personality does. 

You can have it all, money, wealth, a million dollar job and look like a model but if you have a shit personality you will always be alone. 

So no, status means absolutely nothing."
