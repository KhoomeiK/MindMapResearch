As for my dad, he breaks the law to gain things in life wrongfully. He advised me to marry an immigrant for money. I put my foot down and said no because i was dating someone. Dad kept pushing, saying it's not for love, it's for money. I ignored him and eventually got married to my husband. Let's just say marrying the immigrant guy would've made it nearly impossible to get my green card to be with my husband."

unpopularopinion,ff6ip8m,t3_erudx5,1579628043.0,"I will forever be thankful for my 5th grade teacher who asked what happened after i hit a girl. She was bullying me and my friends for a half a year and i couldn't take it anymore. My teacher said that it's not okay but she knew what was happening but couldn't do anything. That if this girl kept bullying, i had to keep fighting. She made the situation pass without a problem."
Animemes,ff675gz,t3_ertaqk,1579620733.0,Us in Scandinavia aren't as lucky as everyone else in Europe.

unpopularopinion,ff5548d,t3_erkpqx,1579580496.0,"When i visited the states, i thought this was a thing as well. But it turned out that in northern region (Minnesota), you take off the shoes because of the weather. You can't walk around in winter boots after being outside in the snow. So really it's a region thing. But as feels European, yeah, i agree. Wearing shoes indoors is weird."
