depression,ffaax4d,t1_ffa9pso,1579731321.0,I know it's so hard to think positively when depressed (I suffer too) but you don't know for a fact that you are bothering these people. They could just move if they didn't like it. Maybe you could get some wet wipes to wash the important areas (bits and pits lol) then it might make you feel a bit better? It helped me anyway when I went through my phase of not even being able to wash. Maybe distract yourself too whilst travelling to help ease the negative thoughts.

On the other hand, the majority of opinions I've seen are happy for them both. If it was going to be anyone to do this, then it was going to be Harry. I think he just wants a 'normal' life. He's like 35 ISH? And all he has ever known is royalty, j don't blame him for wanting to be out of the spot light a tad. Over the last few decades, traditions haven't been the same really in the UK regarding the royal family, especially Harry in his younger years lol. I wish them both all the best and honestly, I'd probably do the same thing too.

I'm so happy that I decided to choose life. I've got alot of help since and found medication that helps. I've found more positive relationships and have surrounded myself with positivity. I feel positive for my future now and I really really hope that you  feel the same soon.

Do you suffer from anxiety generally? What you're experiencing sounds very much like what I experience when mega anxious. I've been told by my psychiatrist that it is heart palpitations and mini panic attacks. Worrying about dying from these symptoms can make the feelings worse (in my case I fear I'm going to have a heart attack because it feels like I have them). 

Although it might not be anxiety related so I would definitely suggest going to your doctor about it anyway. Better safe than sorry!

The meaning behind the importance of the item in the game is important too. Maybe speaking to someone professionally could help unwind why you feel the way that you do. I wish you all the best :)"
