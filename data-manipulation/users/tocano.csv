Economics,ffobtmo,t1_ffmmzd3,1580076021.0,"Even in a theoretical ideal global govt, as others have pointed out, the more number of people a given representative represents, the less they actually represent any individual constituent. 

Reality is far from that idyllic. Look at massive international organizations like the UN or the EU. In the EU, the few elected representatives don't get to determine the agenda. And in the UN, all representatives are political appointments.

And that is directly reflected in persistent corruption and kickback issues dating back to virtually their founding. 

But let's say there's a worldwide revolution that somehow pressures out the entire incumbency and elects (even though there aren't elections now) a completely new class of actually noble, honorable and honest representatives (against all odds) that forces the global govt to reform and institutes that theoretical paragon of virtue. One thing to remember is that any concentration of money and authority **NECESSARILY** attract those that would abuse that power for their own selfish interest. So within a few elections you'd see a huge number of silver-tongued, power-hungry sociopaths, looking at how to manipulate the system to their own advantage. 

Consolidation and centralization may *SOUND* like a good idea to create a single point of pressure to coerce the world into stopping bad behavior and encouraging good behavior, but that kind of power predominantly attracts those that WANT that power. Not the people that should have such power.

Best to avoid such concentration and centralization to whatever extent possible."

Seeking cheaper cost for manufacturing processes is not some new trend. It's not some newly realized issue.

He's making it seem like individual countries are moving backwards. Like Bangladesh, while already poor and had low labor standards, has ""in recent years"" begun actively lowering their labor and environmental standards to seek business investment.

Is that the case, or is he basically just lamenting first world problems here? That is, because Bangladesh is poor, their lower labor and environmental standards aren't up to Summers' expectations.  As such, we need a global organization (run by smart first world people like Summers) to tell third world countries how they should regulate. Ignore how those jobs increase prosperity to the country. Forget the alternatives for low skilled poor in these places if high labor and environmental standards push companies out of these countries. Ignore the consequences for forcing these countries to effectively skip the developmental process. So allow us in the first world to set minimum standards for how you operate.  And if there are any negatives, dont worry, we will magnanimously just increase the foreign aid check a little to offset. 

But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there has been a huge degradation of labor and environmental standards in individual countries around the world that is for some reason only become a problem ""in recent years"". I just need more to back that assertion up than that some countries are already poor and so have relatively low standards. 

Otherwise this just feels like Summers, after spending years effectively defending this behavior as bringing prosperity, is now lamenting the downsides of this process for cheap virtue signaling."

Private services like these typically offer an on-the-spot alternative cost model. For example, if you choose not to pay your $75/yr membership fee, then when you have a fire you can choose to pay for the service at the time of a fire for $2000. That way you still have the option, but the incentive is to pay for it insurance style rather than risk it and end up with a huge lump payment because you chose to roll the dice."
EnoughLibertarianSpam,ffdzalc,t1_ffcupwu,1579832662.0,"Good lord the propaganda. The Libertarian party wasn't started by Kochs. It was started directly in response and in opposition to Nixon, the Vietnam war, the war on drugs, and the switch to pure fiat money and its inflation (which directly advantages wealthy bankers over the poor). And legalizing same sex relationships was part of its inaugural platform.

Libertarianism rails AGAINST the kind of corporatism - the subsidies, the bailouts, the tax breaks, the corporate loopholes, the limited liability, the state protected intellectual property - that the Kochs used and advocated for. The Kochs also started several think tanks that *claim* to be libertarian, but actually tried to intellectually JUSTIFY that corporatism. There are other libertarian organizations that directly conflict and argue against much of the early work by those think tanks. 

So no, libertarianism != Kochs. 

Corporations and libertarians FREQUENTLY disagree - because the vast majority of corporations aren't run by libertarians. Not only are many corporations run by explicitly progressive political individuals, but the majority of the rest are merely opportunists. So they don't care about any principle of non-aggression or of a free market. If they can get an advantage by getting a govt subsidy, [they'll pursue it hard](https://reason.com/2014/10/15/crony-capitalism-taxpayers-forced-to-fun/). If they can gain an advantage by ENCOURAGING govt to [regulate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/16/uber_taxi_nyc_shuts_down.html) that industry, [they](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/report-verizon-fios-gets-perks-from-government-while-avoiding-regulations/#p3) - [will](http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121008/RETAIL07/310089952/dealers-call-tesla-factory-stores-illegal).

Free markets are unbelievably tumultuous and difficult. They are unpredictable for a business. One year you're raking in millions in profits, the next year an upstart has come in and stolen all your business. Corporations don't like dynamic, challenging environments. They like safe, predictable environments. Environments where they don't have to take risks to stay in their position of success. But you can't do that in a free market. Large profits are like blood in the water, attracting every shark around to get into that industry to try to take a chunk of those profits for themselves. 

So corporations often WANT the govt. Without using the govt to prevent competition, a corporation can't stop another company from duplicating their processes, and even improving on them. Without relying on the govt to ensure that only a handful of known competitors are in a given market, they can't keep a new innovator from upsetting the established setup. So once a corporation has tasted success and gotten to a good place of profits and marketshare, many corporations frequently RUN to govt to have politicians and bureaucrats pull up the ladder behind them and make it as difficult as possible for newcomers to challenge their position.

That's what the Kochs have done and what many of their think tanks advocated for. That is NOT libertarianism. 

But who am I kidding... I'm sure you won't understand this. After all, it's not like anyone has ever misconstrued what your political ideology is about."

austrian_economics,ff9jwno,t3_es696l,1579714574.0,"There is never equal negotiating power. Ever. This idea is like perfect competition: It is a theoretical construct that reality simply never, ever reflects.

When you go into a Saks, do you have equal negotiating power? Not really. They set the price, you either choose to pay it or not. Is this egregiously unfair? Some might argue yes, but what Saks offers isn't a critical need by anyone, so I would argue it is not. 

So how about another example: When you go into Whole Foods, do you have equal negotiating power? Not really. They set the price, you either choose to pay it or not. Is this egregiously unfair? Some might argue yes, especially since food is a basic need. However, there are alternatives to Whole Foods from which to get food, so I would argue it is not.

So how about another example: When you go into WalMart, do you have equal negotiating power? Not really. They set the price, you either choose to pay it or not. Is this egregiously unfair? Some might argue yes, since WalMart is already targeting the lower income population. However, there are alternatives to WalMart from which to get cheap items, so I would argue it is not.

So how about another example: When you go into a flea market, do you have equal negotiating power? Not really. There may be negotiation on price, but who has the greater negotiating power? The person who desires/needs the other's item less. That is, if the person selling the blankets wants your money LESS than you need the blanket, then you still have unequal negotiating power (and vice versa). Few would argue that this is unfair.

So how about another example: When you are selling with another individual, do you have equal negotiating power? Not really. Even if there is some negotiation on price, who has the greater negotiating power? Again, the person who desires/needs the other's item less. That is, if the person selling the item wants your money LESS than you need the item, then you still have unequal negotiating power (and vice versa). And few would argue that this is unfair.

Same holds true for a job. You are simply selling your labor. Yes, if you need the money (*from that particular company*) more than they need your labor, you're in an unequal position. However, there are lots of jobs out there. In fact, as others here have pointed out, one of the biggest **LIMITER** of available jobs is the govt. From things like occupational licensing on things from hair braiders to flower arrangers, to interior decorators, etc, to both [federal](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2014/09/15/lake-ferry-company-fined/15688309/) and [local](https://fee.org/articles/did-california-just-kill-the-gig-economy/) - [regulations](http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121008/RETAIL07/310089952/dealers-call-tesla-factory-stores-illegal) on businesses, to the minimum wage, all place huge barriers for the lowest skilled workers to get a job. That makes any potential jobs that much MORE necessary for these low-skilled workers, placing them in an even MORE unequal negotiating position. 

So, equal negotiating position is not reality. However, govt makes unequal positions WORSE for the *most vulnerable* by preventing alternative options from being legally available."

But PHP had some major deficiencies and is falling out of favor, so I'm  currently learning Python.

I would also add that any attempts to legally restrict ability to financially support one's preferred candidate will not work. You will simply never, ever, EVER, **EVER** get money out of politics. As long as you have billion dollar projects that govt can make or break, there will be enormous incentive to spend tens or hundreds of millions to positively influence it. 

Legally prohibiting campaign contributions and other forms of monetary support would only prevent legitimate, above board support, while making behind-closed-doors support the only game in town. You can prohibit direct bribes and they'll switch to indirect bribes. You legally prohibit indirect bribes and they'll switch to anonymous donations to foundations. You legally prohibit anonymous donations to foundations and they'll switch to multi-million dollar speaking engagements. You legally prohibit paid speaking engagements and they'll switch to an overpaid job after they leave office.

You get to speak to him for a few minutes, briefly describing what you do, why, and what you're hoping to accomplish. He seems interested and asks you to make an appt to speak with him later. A couple weeks later you're on the phone with him speaking more in-depth about the issue and what you're hoping to have him help with. He asks you if you can come to his office and speak to him in person on this. You go and describe the brutal conditions, showing him pictures and videos. He sympathizes with your intentions and ask you to work with his staff on crafting the legislation for this. So you email back and forth with his staff helping create and structure the bill. He tells you with the election near, it will likely have to be introduced after the election. 

So you go online and made the maximum contribution to his campaign. In fact, you also contribute to a PAC devoted to the candidate hoping he can win the election and push through your legislation. In addition, as he makes his way through a nearby city, you buy a ticket to his $2500/plate dinner to help his campaign as much as you can afford. 

The candidate wins his election and is now poised to introduce your bill against puppy mills to the national legislature. 

You have been engaged in lobbying."

It absolutely does. That **IS** the items value to that person. You assert that a painting that sold for $20million is actually only worth $5 (since that's all you would pay for it). Why should your assertion be considered the ""true"" value instead of the value determined by the actual sale price? Maybe I would pay $400 for the painting. Why is my estimate not the ""true"" value instead of yours?

Have you actually been reading my comments? I've said from the first comment that nobody can ASSERT what the value of an item is. Appraisals for art (or pieces of paper) are, at best, a well educated estimate. They cannot substituted for actual value - which gets determined when it's sold."

Of course you don't need the state for scams to exist. The problem is that you're merely ASSERTING that paintings are not as valuable as they actually sell for. 

If all modern art is nothing but a scam, then I expect it'd be easy to cite numerous examples of a piece of cheap art (with nothing more than an purchased overvalued appraisal) directly used to satisfy a $20million dollar debt. You can sit there and assert ""That painting's not worth $20million."" or ""That banana taped to a wall is not worth $100k."" all day long. But your personal evaluation is not what determines value. All you are really saying is ""That painting is not worth $20million **to me**."" ""That banana taped to a wall is not worth $100k **to me**.""

Those are two very different things. The Pawn Shop shows are closer to your game shop example from before. They were just trying to sell it and trying to get the maximum possible price. Anyone that actually accepted the word of the debtor for the value of some trinket used to pay the debt is just stupid.

hahaha ... Is that how you think contracts will work without the state? And again, this is completely irrelevant to the discussion of value. 

Come now. I'm starting to think you're not discussing in good faith. 

The point is that any asserted or estimated or ""appraised"" value is nothing more than a guess until actually sold and a concrete value is determined. Trying to get the state to either 1) investigate the ""scam"" of art or 2) objectively determine the value of any individual's wealth, is virtually impossible.

Not at all. The piece of paper itself has historical significance. It may have been just a scratch piece of paper. In fact, the math on the paper could be mostly incomplete or even incorrect. Yet the price of $50 may still exist and it comes from someone's subjective value they place on the significance of that piece of paper.

That's true.

Depends on people's subjective value. It's not *likely* that the canvas would be worth much without the art on it. However, people place unexpected significance on strange things. ""The canvas on which DaVinci painted ____ before it was destroyed in 1732"" may still hold enough significance for some that they pay a wildly higher price for an old canvas than others may otherwise consider reasonable.
