socialanxiety,fckjx3e,t3_ehir4w,1577726952.0,"The first thing you need to know about social anxiety is that she is just a fear and not the reality. I know it's easy to say and not easy To do do but me what i do is that I prove myself wrong.
I make a list of all the contrary argument of the negetive perception i think people have of me.
You have To say To yourself ""do i have reals arguments To think that "". This is really hard at first because your mind is always bringing you back to your negetive thoughts but you have To be patient and seperate your mind of the reality because the bigest mistake you can make is thinking  that your thoughts are the reality.

Go see cognitive distorsion on Google you Will probably reconize yourself.

Because, youre blushing because youre embarrassed and you feel embarrased because youre blushing. I have this problem too and I started too accept it when I'm blushing. And when someone is telling you someting that is making you blushing well continue to talk to him like noting is happening. I know it's hard because you feel like the person see right through you but  you have to face your problem I guarantee you
