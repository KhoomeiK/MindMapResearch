A personal size bag of potato chips that you might have with lunch is 150-160 calories, and if you're regularly eating 4-6 of those, you really ought to cut back.

Over a 24 hour period, sure that's do-able and 24 hour fasts can be a good way to reset. Beyond 24 hours though you're going to start feeling the ill effects of being really, really hungry. You'll probably be irritable, tired, low energy, and will feel actual pain from being hungry. And it's hard to get the right amount of nutrients from 300kcal of food per day as well.

If you want to sustainably lose weight, consider cutting 25% of your daily caloric needs. So if you need 2,000 kcal per day to maintain your weight, start eating 1,500 to 1,600 per day."

Cooking,fgfvs7k,t1_fge7crv,1580748690.0,"My understanding is that most pros prefer Diamond Crystal because it is not iodized like Morton salt, and the iodine does have its own flavor that it adds to the salt. So when you read recipes from sites like Bon Appetit or Serious Eats, 99% of the time it's Diamond Crystal. 

It's probably good to use Diamond Crystal anyways because if you under salt your food it's easier to add salt later, but if you over salt you're kinda screwed."
Cooking,fgftbv5,t1_fgfnn5o,1580747151.0,"I would suggest somewhere in the range of 75% flour -25% starch to 50-50 flour and starch. I have two different fried chicken recipes I use, one is 75-25 and the other 50-50 and they both come out great.

On top of the corn starch, another great tip for crispy chicken is to double fry. Do your first fry for 7-10 minutes, then let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes. Then fry the chicken in the oil again for 5-7 minutes.

What the rest period does is allow any moisture that would prevent the chicken from being really crispy to migrate to the breading. Then the second fry removes that moisture and makes sure the breading is crispy and crunchy. If you have ever had Korean Fried Chicken, this is the technique they use to make it stay super crisp under those super flavorful sauces.

Oh yeah and definitely get a thermometer, and do not over crowd your frying pot (or whatever vessel you are using). The chicken should only cover about 50% of the surface of the oil, or the temp will drop too much."
