Perhaps I am reading too far into this, but other living things that promote the formation of ice crystals usually do so as a specific adaptation to prevent ice from forming within them - and I see no reason to believe that this isn't a similar adaptation. I guess it's a hypothesis until expirementally proven - would just be an odd coincidence, as this type of ice doesn't seem to happen with other fungus."

In the year 2015, German and Swiss scientists identified the fungus [Exidiopsis effusa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exidiopsis_effusa) as key to the formation of hair ice.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_ice#cite_note-hofmann2015-1) The fungus was found on every hair ice sample examined by the researchers, and disabling the fungus with [fungicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungicide) or hot water prevented hair ice formation.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_ice#cite_note-hofmann2015-1) The fungus shapes the ice into fine hairs through an uncertain mechanism and likely stabilizes it by providing a recrystallization inhibitor similar to [antifreeze proteins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze_protein).[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_ice#cite_note-hofmann2015-1)[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_ice#cite_note-press2015-2)

However, they discover that the government of the ship secretly tortures a [Star Whale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q%E2%80%93Z\)#Star_Whale) that guides the ship, the abandonment of which is believed will destroy the ship and kill everyone on board.
The episode, which featured the first time Amy was away from her home world, was designed to show how important she was to the Doctor and his need for a companion. As part of the second [production block](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_blocking) of the series, the episode's production took place in Autumn 2009. ""The Beast Below"" was seen by 8.42 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD, the fifth most-watched programme in the week it was broadcast. It was met with a positive to mixed reception from critics; many praised the chemistry between Smith and Gillan, but some thought that there were too many imaginative concepts that did not make a satisfying conclusion, or that the message of the episode was not as strong as it should have been."""

Futurology,fcpj2yf,t1_fcpgjo2,1577865525.0,"In March 1998, Delta and Land Pine Company of Scott, Mississippi received the patent for the genetically engineered terminator seed[[1]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-1). This seed prohibits the natural evolution of the crops from occurring, and instead stop the growth process of the seeds second generation before they can mature. Monsanto claims the terminator seed would solve the problem they created of genetically modified crops contaminating neighbouring crops[[2]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-2). Fear quickly arose from this announcement, and later became a governmental concern once giant agricultural biotechnology corporation, Monsanto acquired Delta and Land Pine Company  mastermind behind the feared terminator seed[[3]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-3). Although Monsanto pledged to not commercialize the seed, tensions grew between chemical, seed and biotechnological companies; meanwhile movements against the terminator seed were led by consumers, environmentalist and sustainable development activists[[4]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-4). Monsanto claims the terminator seed would solve the problem they created of genetically modified crops contaminating neighbouring crops[[5]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-5).
These genetically modified seeds have little benefits to the farmers. Those who are in advantage are the seed companies. The seed prevents farmers from re-planting seeds throughout the seasons by producing a sterile seed, which is unable to reproduce[[6]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-6). This forces the farmer to turn to commercial seeds, profiting the large corporations[[7]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-7) and creating greater dependency on proprietary seeds and their companion chemicals[[8]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-8). Another advantage would be the improvements for monopoly seed pricing decreasing price discrimination between farmers. But this again benefits the seed corporations as well, by paying farmers equally, with no risk of paying a farmer who reuses their seeds (less expensive for the farmer) the same as a farmer who does not[[9]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-9).
Aggressive marketing schemes target uneducated farmers, unable to see through the scientific claims being promoted by the major agrochemical corporations[[10]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-10). The introduction of the terminator seed means the traditional method of saving seeds for certain environmental conditions is obsolete[[11]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-11). Without a farmers ability to alter their seeds as environmental conditions change, their resources will deplete. Those who cant afford to replace seeds seasonally, such as those in developing countries, are greatly impacted by the disposability of the terminator seed[[12]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-12). Poorer farmers of the tropics and sub-tropics produce 15-20 percent of the worlds food, and encourage genetic diversity in plant breeding[[13]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-13). Not only are the farmers at a loss, but also the populations food security. Even for the better off farmers of developing countries are at risk, as the need to re-purchase seeds increase costs and control through licensing agreements[[14]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-14), leaving the resource-poor farmers to los[e] their ability to determine their own lives  transforming them to meet the demand of their new masters[[15]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-15). This isolates farmers from the corporations, harming their much-needed relationship.
The terminator seed has the ability to decrease crop diversity, pollinate nearby crops with the sterile gene, as well as wipe out agricultural populations[[16]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-16), leading the debate to a question of ethics. Although the seeds are intended for the use of already genetically modified[[17]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-17), if disease strikes within the crop, it can wipe out the entire field[[18]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-18). This negatively impacts the farmer, the species and the population that relies on the farms outputs. With the reduction of feasible crops because of terminator seed complications within developing countries means the dependency on developed countries[[19]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-19). This reliance produces severe marginalization and diminution of its powers of self-determination[[20]](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-20). While major corporations argue the need for technological advancements and control in agriculture to cater to the worlds food demand, organizations counter argue that this can only be achieved through common ownership, biodiversity and ecosystem conscious approaches[[21](https://cases.open.ubc.ca/monsanto-and-terminator-seeds/#cite_note-21)
