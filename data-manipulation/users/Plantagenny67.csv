The price of fast food is going up, espeically in states that have a higher minimum wage, so it really makes me angry to think about the amount of $$$ going to sh#t rather than using their $$$ wisely to buy good food and still have something left over. And yeah why are they ALL tattooed??? Don’t tattoos cost a bit of money? WTF?!?!?!?!?!"

The academics might be similar in other places, but the Notre Dame community and experience are unique, and something that can't really be replicated elsewhere. Notre Dame gave me opportunities that I wouldn't have had in other places, and exposed me to people and ideas that I would not have encountered in other universities. Thus, it was worth it to me, and I can't imagine having gone anywhere else."
