politics,ff90ukm,t1_ff8bfrq,1579701995.0,"""if you care about your bones, vote Nunes. He is the most pro-milk candidate you can ask for! When those noodle-boned democrats take away your guns, bibles, and milk, you'll wish you voted for Nunes.""

A VOTE FOR NUNES IS A VOTE FOR BONES"
politics,ff8zwhx,t3_esarg2,1579701249.0,"He's been winning, press just hasn't covered him fairly. It's awesome to see that he can't be ignored anymore. That said... He won't win if we don't get out and vote. Don't get lazy and assume that everyone else will carry the torch, please please please do your part and go vote. If you hear anyone talking about the political landscape and wanting things to change, remind them that their opinion only matters when they vote."
awfuleverything,ff2sun6,t3_er6p9d,1579522694.0,Anybody know the number/company? I'd love to put it in my phone to cheer me up when I'm feeling blue.

politics,fcsns6z,t3_eipby1,1577920615.0,"Every time I think he has hit the rock bottom of stupid, he busts out an auger of idiocy and drills deeper."
bipolar,fcnthyc,t3_ei6671,1577818107.0,Great job!! Keep it up tomorrow and celebrate 2 years ;) we're all rooting for you.
RoastMe,fclf6it,t1_fckqfzr,1577746383.0,Spectacular hahaha
RoastMe,fckei6s,t1_fckayrm,1577723533.0,I never realized how much I look like him until the multiple comparisons. I've always heard dollar store dexter.
RoastMe,fckecap,t1_fckdd4y,1577723427.0,"Oompa loompa doopity doo, if I was wise I'd be a more complete person"
RoastMe,fcke4hp,t1_fckbjj4,1577723287.0,I laughed so hard at this. Great job.
bipolar,fck4j8v,t1_fc4ifiz,1577716373.0,"Thanks sincerely, for the detail there. It is hard to explain to others that were not just up and down personalities, so yes i feel there is a lot out value in something tailored specifically to us. I really feel like people on the outside looking in, no matter how much of a positive intent they may have, don't really 'get it.' it means so much to know someone or something has a real understanding of what we deal with daily."
bipolar,fck1fpk,t3_ehe11w,1577713642.0,"Proud of you, too, dude or dudette. Family support goes such a long way. Keep doing what you're doing!"
politics,fck04cq,t3_ehklb4,1577712340.0,"Yeah, 100%on board with this. I'm hoping we have a genuinely amazing person for the office, but I'll go for just about anybody other than the guy who had such a terrible impact on our people, global reputation, and the country as a whole.

Guys and gals - this is not year to cast a 'statement' vote for an independent that doesn't actually have a shot to win. Hate to say it but this probably is the worst election for it. We need to get him out and start repairing everything he's broken."
bipolar,fc4fon8,t1_fc48ei2,1577415305.0,I am leaning towards emoods because it's been mentioned a few times but the daily check in prompt would be very helpful. I think I'll try them both for a while and determine which is for me
bipolar,fc4fh95,t1_fc40oeq,1577415140.0,Sounds like emoods may be the way to go. 99c/mo is totally worth it
bipolar,fc4feu5,t1_fc3zgdf,1577415085.0,Thanks! I think I'm going to start by downloading and using the ones mentioned here and seeing what I like best at about a month... Should be able to figure it out by then.
bipolar,fc49fji,t1_fc48656,1577410227.0,Hahaha. Thanks! I actually never thought to look for a bipolar reddit until I started having some really bad manic episodes recently due to med adjustment. It's been nice to see that other people understand and can actually make light of it through memes even. Kind of gallows humor sometimes but it takes some of the weight off. You seem like a good bunch and I'm glad to be here :)
bipolar,fc3uyhi,t3_eg0s48,1577399293.0,Really hate to see this. I've got an appointment next week and it's the most excited I've been in months.
politics,fbtfx8o,t3_eeenqr,1577077503.0,Wow. Just wow. There's a lot to unpack here.
