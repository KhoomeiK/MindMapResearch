Kmfmdm on solclaim was the only person i flat out couldnt compete with, my delays and power casting he decimated me harder than anti parazi.  Anti parazi when I fought him even commented to me we had basically the same cast style ( random powerslides or power circles into slides etc but I couldnt fast cast reliably, but he told me I was great for having cast times memorized almost perfectly) but because I lacked the animation breaking and on demand forcecast ( war release pre cast time, I only ever mastered delay) I couldnt compete.  Kmfmdm on solclaim tho, comparing him to my fights with anti were just worlds apart.  I could dodge anti point blank reliably enough to survive, but never land even with a perfect delay cast into his slide change, kmfmdm I never even got that far.  3 cycles bam over.  Never lasted more than tops 5 war casts with kmfmdm even fully warded and spamming s2h the whole time it was insane."
