educationalgifs,ffgke8n,t1_ffgg8hu,1579908255.0,"You would also have to assume given that because Ganymede orbits inside the massive magnetic shell of Jupiter that it would be more protected from atmospheric stripping than Titan, which given Titans's greater distance from the sun suffers from Saturn having a pitifully weak magnetic field (less than Earth's). 

Remember that the magnetic field of Jupiter is 20x that of Earth while the magnetic field of Saturn is only about 90% of Earth's. 
 
All these factors imply that the magnetism of the host world is not the defining feature of keeping an atmosphere."
educationalgifs,ffghoo8,t1_ffgg8hu,1579906470.0,Venus has a dense atmosphere because of the interaction of its ionosphere with the solar winds and the induced magnetic field that creates. Without that effect the dense atmosphere of Venus would have been gone a long time ago.

educationalgifs,ffgdhtd,t1_ffga3sw,1579903812.0,">Their atmosphere is not made from ""semi light stuff"" like nitrogen and oxygen.
 
The atmosphere of Titan is mostly **nitrogen** (94%) with a surface pressure of about 1.5x sea-level on Earth. 
 
The atmosphere of Ganymede is mostly **oxygen** but the surface pressure is more like 200k feet above sea-level on Earth."
