cricut,ff6pkps,t1_ff6p138,1579632211.0,I found the image online and added text that was most like the text on the existing buttons. I had to redo the arrows myself. The text is Al Nile in bold.

succulents,fdszva7,t1_fdsz4uj,1578710101.0,"I thought clippings and leaves were the same. I’ll educate myself more on that and the process. I’m super new to this, sorry!"
succulents,fdsyw1l,t1_fdsw8kf,1578709743.0,So you think he’s a goner? I can certainly try to propagate some leaves... can I use the same soil if the rest of the plant is dead? It’s winter here (currently in a blizzard) and I’ve already checked local stores for the right soil but since it’s out of season they don’t have it in stock.
succulents,fdsx4a7,t3_en178q,1578709077.0,"Ok so I bought this guy from Sams Club and it’s from the company Wild Interiors. I don’t know what type of soil they use. 

The leaves are pliable but the rest of the plant is incredibly stiff. Im thinking it probably hasn’t received enough sun. Does that make sense given the description of the plant? 

I was picking dried up leaves off and that created the hole you see in the main stalk of the plant. 

I watered it about 2 weeks ago and the soil seems really dry and is separated from the inner plastic pot. 

Idk lol I’m all over the place trying to fix it but I don’t know the best course of action. Feel free to offer any advice or ask more questions.. it’s appreciated. Please don’t shame me, I feel bad for these guys :("
