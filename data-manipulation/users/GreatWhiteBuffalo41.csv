It's OK to cry. It's OK to have a moment, or many where you feel defeated. It's OK to feel the way you do. I expect nothing more from you but just to be you and feel your feels.

You are loved. You are strong. You will make it through."

You're enough, you're amazing, smart, thoughtful and caring. It's time to start looking elsewhere for the right kind of support. A good teacher, a guidance councillor, a friends parent, any type of good role model.

Please don't ever think you're not good enough. You are enough. If they can't see it, they have a problem. I wish you the best. I hope you can find some wonderful in person role model."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff80ak3,t1_ff5ysmm,1579662660.0,"I was talking with a friend the other day who mentioned his other friends several years ago gave up their stable jobs to follow their dreams.

Now several years later they're bringing in a bunch of money and he's only making a few dollars more than before.

Roots will grow from those nodes as long as they're placed below soil or water (whichever way you prop). Anything above that exposed to air those nodes will eventually become leaves. As far as the cut stem, it usually doesn't grow from there. The stem will stop there but the new leaves may continue the stem on.

I hope that was what you were asking."

AskWomen,ff48ekg,t1_ff3aonh,1579557784.0,"General watering tips, water until water is running out the drainage holes in the bottom. Only water when you can stick your finger in the soil and it's dry for an inch or two (maybe more if it's a really big pot). Make sure all plants have drainage holes. Succulents and cacti hate having wet roots for an extended period of time and will rot. If you can water them from the bottom, even better. Put your pot in a bucket of water and slowly submerge leaving the plant itself above water.

Also, if you're watering during the day try not to get the leaves wet, they'll burn in the sun just like you swimming in a pool ;)"

My parents taught me how to do laundry and dishes etc but, I had to teach my boyfriend. Different life experiences mean everyone doesn't know the same things and that's OK.

Thankfully we live in the internet age. If you want to learn something you search it or you find a video to show you how to do the thing. Self improvement is worth it. And no one should call you names for not knowing something."
