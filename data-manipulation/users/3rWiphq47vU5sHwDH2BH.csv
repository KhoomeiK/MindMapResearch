selfimprovement,feoah9p,t3_eq5z62,1579297296.0,"Waking up at the same time every day and getting 8 hours of sleep. Seriously, no other habit has improved my life more profoundly than having solid, consistent sleep."

science,feelu16,t1_feeiv5p,1579036369.0,"The common advice is that sativa strains will make you more alert, and indica strains will put you to sleep. I would suspect the THC (main active ingredient, and present in both strains) is the main culprit of disrupting REM sleep, though I'm not 100% on that. So far as I know, both types of weed will hurt REM sleep.

Maybe a strain that's high in CBD and low in THC would help you fall asleep, while not disrupting REM sleep as much?"
science,feehd8i,t1_feeas9q,1579033779.0,"When compared to other drugs (eg. alcohol, meth, heroin), marijuana withdrawal is relatively easy to handle. That being said, marijuana withdrawal is absolutely a real thing! If you smoke a lot every day, then quit, you should expect some of the following:

* Boredom
* Irritability
* Difficulty falling asleep
* REM rebound (weed disrupts your REM sleep, so when you quit, your body will try and make up for all of the lost REM sleep. Nightmares are common for the first few days)
* Less appetite and/or upset stomach
* Anxiety (thanks [NoTraceUsername](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoTraceUsername/))

I have experienced mild versions of these from smoking for a few months during the evenings, then stopping cold turkey. They all went away within about a week. I still smoke once or twice a week now without issue."

selfimprovement,fcw8ehg,t3_ej4t3k,1578019502.0,"I find it helpful to only focus on one goal at a time. If I try and make goals for 5 different things, I'll inevitably get overwhelmed and won't finish any of them fully.

""One of my goals is to be more intuitive""

How do you intend to track your progress for this? I prefer goals that I can easily measure progress on. For example, instead of saying ""I want to read more"", say ""I will read at least 10 minutes a day"". That way it is crystal clear if you are progressing (ie. You either did or did not read for 10 min)"

selfimprovement,fcl7vwg,t1_fcjl25a,1577741718.0,"Haha, I'm almost 28 so we're probably quite similar. I definitely felt the same thing while gaming. Gaming for hours every night was so automatic that I didn't question it. I started to realize I just wasn't having fun anymore, and felt the same guilty feeling you describe.

I still game a few hours a week, but I don't feel guilty anymore, and it's a lot more fun again. And yes, the climbing community is great, everyone is really friendly!"
selfimprovement,fcik4ri,t1_fcic89x,1577663897.0,"Well, that's up to you! Try a bunch of new things, and see what works for you. Once you find a few hobbies you genuinely enjoy, it will be an easy choice to do those things instead of video games.

I used to default to video games when I was bored, but after branching out and trying lots of things, I feel like I have more options now."
selfimprovement,fci80p7,t3_ehccs7,1577658844.0,"I've been going through the same thing recently. I've played thousands of hours of video games throughout my life, but I've been losing interest lately, and I don't have the patience anymore to spend many hours learning new videos games, or improving at older ones. For me, improving my skills at videos games does not improve my life in any other areas.

So, I picked up new hobbies. Learning piano, going to the gym, rock climbing, etc. are much more fulfilling to me now than videos games. I understand the feeling you describe of losing a part of your identity, but your identity is constantly changing. At some point, I realized I no longer identified as a person who sits for hours on end playing video games. It seems sad at the time, but I am much happier and feel more fulfilled since cutting back."
selfimprovement,fbj3n49,t3_edjooh,1576923807.0,"One of the most simple yet effective methods I've found is to take a freezing cold shower. It's almost meditative for me in the sense that I can't help but be pulled into the present moment when the icy cold water hits my skin.

It might not give you the same rush as you'd get from fighting, but it definitely makes me feel alive haha."
