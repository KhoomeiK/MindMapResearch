MurderedByWords,febdlm8,t1_fe9mq6e,1578957731.0,"He probably won't win.

As someone from his district, we had a few shake ups last election. The returning contender, Republican [Dan Donovan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Donovan_(politician)) assumed he had the election in the bag, and even then was coming near to his retirement.

However, in the Republican Primaries, a very bold candidate imo, [Mike Grim](https://youtu.be/MeJhXaC5WPg). He held the office in the past, and I personally support him because knowing the people from Staten Island and Bay Ridge, I feel like the crazy shit he says best represents the area. At the end of the day, Donovan lost, and Grim I feel weakened his support because everyone was split.

However, a new contender, [Max Rose](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Rose_(politician)), came out of no where. He swooped in, started advertising everywhere, and got an extremely powerful base. He became a bit of a local meme (see: the 'this is INSANE' Instagram add), and kinda had Donovan while he was down. At the end, he rallied, and the Dems won.

Anyway, my point is, Max Rose is kinda a local power house, and while I don't think he'll possess the office for more than 6 years, I don't see him losing to a guy like Joe. He has a strong base and flipped a bunch of people off of a weak candidate and I don't see a lot of people flipping for a scandalous candidate like Joey.

tldr: Current rep for that district is a Dem and a powerhouse so I don't see him losing to a guy like Joey."
