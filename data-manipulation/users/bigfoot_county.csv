Reddit has a handful of immutable opinions, like a disdain for portrait videos or an overwhelming love of rick and morty. Thinking rentals are a bad investment choice is another one of them. In reddit's mind, every rental gets trashed immediately, right before the roof caves in and the foundation starts cracking. Just like the stock market goes up 10% every year in their experience (maybe in part because they started paying attention in about 2011).

worldnews,fgfkz9e,t1_fgfkg89,1580741553.0,"Unfortunately, few issues are as cut and dry as they might seem initially, even genital mutilation:

""During the era of colonial rule in Africa, some governments attempted to ban female circumcision and met with resistance. In Sudan, when a law banning infibulation was about to be proclaimed in 1946, many parents rushed to midwives to have their daughters infibulated in case it should become impossible later on. When some midwives were arrested for performing circumcision, anticolonial protests broke out. The British colonial government, fearing a massive nationalist revolt such as those that had occurred in Egypt and Kenya, eventually let the law go uunenforced.[21](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/1997/09/female-circumcision-rite-passage-or-violation-rights#21) 

More recently, calls to action by Western feminists and human rights activists have provoked similar negative reactions. African women have perceived many of these efforts as condescending and derogatory toward their culture. In the words of one infibulated Somali woman, ""If Somali women change, it will be a change done by us, among us. When they order us to stop, tell us what we must do, it is offensive to the black person or the Muslim person who believes in circumcision. To advise is good, but not to order.""[22](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/1997/09/female-circumcision-rite-passage-or-violation-rights#22)

In many Western publications dealing with female circumcision, one anthropologist observes, ""African women are...depicted as aberrant, while intact Western women have their sexuality affirmed as the norm.""[23](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/1997/09/female-circumcision-rite-passage-or-violation-rights#23) Yet, as Nahid Toubia points out, Western women also subject themselves to medically unnecessary, hazardous procedures, such as cosmetic surgery and the insertion of breast implants, to increase their sexual desirability.""

My entire point was that I've encountered people who agree with the native Africans that the efforts are condescending, counterproductive, and hypocritical in light of procedures like breast augmentation. They even take it a step further, arguing that our attempt to intervene is essentially another colonial intrusion. Regardless of whether you or le\_celly or any other worldnews reader believe it or not, these people exist.

Denver,ffdivoi,t1_ffdfic0,1579821810.0,"Why don't we use an analogy to help you understand what's going on here.

Federal law controls and preempts state law. We agree on that, and no one could honestly refute it. But why don't we take a look at some practical examples, because everyone knows there is a difference between theory and practice.

The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 is a federal law that preempts any state law to the contrary. So why aren't the feds shutting down all the dispensaries in California, Colorado, etc? Because there is a functional difference between the ideal scenario of the Federal Governments laws never being contradicted, and the practical reality that laws are in conflict all the time. To plainly assert ""The FAA retains exclusive jurisdiction of navigable airspace"" is about as toothless and impotent as stating ""The **Controlled Substances Act** (**CSA**) is the statute establishing [federal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States) [U.S. drug policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_United_States) under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of certain substances is regulated.""

Anyone who's spent more than 5 minutes in Colorado knows the Controlled Substances act is not the controlling rule in law of Colorado with respect to Cannabis. It's effect is negligible, if any. As it stands right now, it's a legal fiction that has no practical effect on reality of Cannabis in Colorado.

Similarly, anyone who's spent more than 5 minutes as a trial attorney knows that with a case like being cited for using a drone in a park, you may have a viable legal basis to have that citation overturned - but to extract that judgment will mean (in practical terms) that you have to pay more in attorneys fees and costs than you would just paying the fine outright.

As I explained in another comment, if you're cited by a Denver or Colorado Authority and you want to challenge that citation (BECAUSE FAA! SO OBVIOUS!) you'll get stuck in front of a District Court Judge who will almost certainly err on the side of the state/locality. Why? Because the locality has almost certainly consulted with the FAA so that there is no conflict (per the source you cited to me). This is literally what your source says, about which types of laws should these localities should be consulting about with the FAA;

* Operational UAS restrictions on flight altitude,
* flight paths;
* **operational bans;**
* **any regulation of the navigable airspace**

If localities were unable to regulate these areas, why would the FAA suggest that these localities consult with them first before implementing any new laws/rules/regulations? Per your own source? Because they can regulate these areas (if they properly consult the FAA) and are encouraged to do so, that's why. That's not even mentioning the fact that the FAA only *recommends* consultation on these issues.

So then you're talking about an appeal, just so you can prove you're right. And let's say you're successful on appeal. But at that point, proving you're right will have costed you many of thousands of dollars, many times the value of the original citation.

• Operational UAS restrictions on flight altitude, flight paths; operational bans; any regulation

landmarks. Federal courts strictly scrutinize state and local regulation of overflight. City of

Anyone who's learned the difference between the meaning of the literal Spanish phrase ""sin semilla"" and the hippie term ""sinsemilla"" from the 60's and 70's meaning ""high quality weed"" would know that concretely, with the two operative words only having a tangential similarity.
