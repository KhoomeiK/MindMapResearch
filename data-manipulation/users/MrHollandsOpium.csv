I wanna say it was 1997, but I was but a wee lad so that year could be wrong. Either way, everyone thought the accident was maybe a conspiracy or a hoax. It wasn’t. They came to find out that the cause of her death was likely due to overwhelming paparazzi camera flash blinding the driver who hit a berm and the limo she was riding in crashed and she died. She was dragged through the tabloids for BS that her ex-husband put her through since their marriage was arranged. 

Harry and William were kids, lived through the thrashing of their mother by the tabloids, saw those same tabloids lead to the death of their mother and now Harry is seeing the start of similar patterns towards his current wife.

You’ll be lonely as fuck at sight from time to time, but your vacations could be spent halfway in like Kenya or Nigeria, or in each other’s host country (which would win a lot of bonus clout and cache in your village).
