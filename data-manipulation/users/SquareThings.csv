lgbt,fdia3dj,t3_elh92b,1578438467.0,"People have an issue with it because of how they see labels.

The “normal” and “abnormal.” It’s difficult to move past that an realize that we’re all people. There is no them and no us. Labels are just descriptions, not definitions. 

This is the same reason it’s so important to use “trans woman/man” instead of mashing them together like “transwoman, transman.” It creates categories and enforces separation between trans and cis people. A trans person is just a kind of person, the same way a gay person or a black person is. You need to keep distance between identity/description and personhood. Why do you think one word monikers for minorities are so common? (Homos, blacks, tr****es, f*gs, d*kes, k*kes etc.) dehumanization."
