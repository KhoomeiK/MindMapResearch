I literally just drain the tofu of the excess water, then toss it into a pan and break it up. I hit it with salt, pepper, and turmeric. Add whatever veggies you want, if you do that. And if I want the eggier taste, I add a bit of kala namak for that sulfuric flavor"

Or you can start with Six of Crows which is a fantasy heist duology. Comes after the Shadow and Bone trilogy but I read it first and didn't feel like I was missing anything important.

vegan,ff214bn,t1_ff1wk0d,1579490992.0,"That seems pretty common from my own experience and several of those I've spoken to. Sadly, you'll never get that same initial rush of ""I've never had this much energy before!"" because it's mostly your body losing the sluggishness of your old diet. I do think it sticks around, as long as you're still eating healthy. As a recent post said, vegan junk food is still junk food.

Still, I haven't been exercising in the last few months (I know, I know, I'm working on it) and I think I have as much energy as a non-exercising vegan compared to an exercising omni, if not more.

Also, as part of the energy boost, I've been napping a lot less and been sleeping better at night, which leads to even more energy through the day!"
