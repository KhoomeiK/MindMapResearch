AskAnAmerican,ffkx2go,t3_eu30n8,1580030551.0,"In my opinion a lot of folks mistaken sub-cultural regional variation with genuine cultural diversity. If you think about it, you could drive from the top of Alaska to the bottom of the Florida Keys and experience a remarkably uniform built environment, language and social customs along the way. 

It's all a very subjective topic as well. A lot of what people think is ""different"" is based on their feelings in a given moment, or length of time. It's impossible to really objectify that. Someone raised in rural northern Maine who hasn't left his region before may *feel* like Houston, Texas is a different universe. To his perspective, it is a different universe as it is different than what he is used to. But in the great scheme of things it's really not that much of a big change.

The US has a singular dominant culture throughout the country with countless non-dominant local cultures (ie: Indian Reservations, ethnic enclaves in cities, etc). But often times because the dominant culture in America is so rooted in the national fabric - it's often hard for people to see it. The US doesn't have another dominant culture in the sense that Spain does, or India, or even Canada. Regional sub-cultural variations are often flaunted (I think partially for marketing and brand purposes on behalf of state businesses) or exaggerated to an extent."

"" Later, Washington was painfully slow to grasp the significance of the war in the Southern states. For the most part, he committed troops to that theater only when Congress ordered him to do so. By then, it was too late to prevent the surrender of Charleston in May 1780 and the subsequent losses among American troops in the South. Washington also failed to see the potential of a campaign against the British in Virginia in 1780 and 1781, prompting Comte de Rochambeau, commander of the French Army in America, to write despairingly that the American general “did not conceive the affair of the south to be such urgency.” Indeed, Rochambeau, who took action without Washington’s knowledge, conceived the Virginia campaign that resulted in the war’s decisive encounter, the siege of Yorktown in the autumn of 1781."""

AskEconomics,ffhizzj,t3_etnfba,1579937424.0,"I suppose it depends on the specifics of the labour market. Minimum wages are price controls on labour - and as such create labour market distortions. But those distortions vary in severity depending on the supply and demand of the labour, which affects the going rate of that labour on the market. The going rate of labour obviously varies by sector.

Lets say you have a single set minimum wage that is far below that average going rate of the labour in most sectors.  That minimum wage will have a minimal affect on unemployment. If the minimum wage is higher than the going rate then you run into problems of unemployment as employers can't afford to hire more staff (or they start cutting benefits and other associated labour costs).

Colorado is fantastic. I hope to explore more ranges, like the San Juans. You should visit the Canadian Rockies some time, they are profoundly beautiful. The Rockies up here tend to be built from limestone as this entire area of the earth was a coral rich shallow sea hundreds of millions of years ago. The mountains here, therefore, tend to be more flaky than their Colorado equivalents. Scree is synonymous with the Canadian Rockies. But the bright side is that their composition gives way to extraordinary dramatic peaks and glacial flour rich tarns that look Caribbean turqouise. Colorado has glacial lakes as well, but the mountains down there are predominantly made from granite which gives them a very hard - pyramid like feature and many interconnected ridges.

hiking,ffdt0m8,t1_ffdshso,1579828186.0,"Where I'm from there's risk for flash storms as well, but the changing variable is the frequency. It seems like the mid latitudes have a higher frequency of storms than the more northerly latitudes during those summer months. Easy enough to get used to, I just started waking up at 2 or 3am and hiked pre-dawn for hikes I expected to take 8-10 hours. But holy jesus was that a baptism by fire - that storm on South Arapaho scared the shit out of me."
hiking,ffdsqt2,t1_ffdsfnc,1579827986.0,I haven't had the privilege of hiking in that area of the continent yet but NY's mountains do interest me. The north Appalachian ranges like the Catskills. It would be a very different feel than what I am used to in the Canadian Rockies.
hiking,ffds7t7,t1_ffdrx79,1579827621.0,"Lightning risk in the alpine just terrifies me. I've been pretty lucky on most of my excursions, but I'm not from CO, I'm from an area where thunderstorm risk is a bit more sporadic and usually less severe. So it was something I didn't even factor in before I began, but it seems like thunderstorms are almost daily like clockwork down there. So I definitely had to adjust to hiking in the pre-dawn hours to avoid the afternoon storms."
AskAnAmerican,ffdr8jd,t1_ffdgifv,1579826970.0,It's incredible the amount of shit people put themselves through to do things that ultimately make them unhappy.
AskAnAmerican,ffdr5i9,t1_ffdpnke,1579826916.0,"True, but it is an aspect of American culture - an attribute shared by many cultures."
hiking,ffdo1xr,t3_eszzx4,1579824976.0,"Beautiful. Which hike is this?

Last summer when I visited CO I scrambled up that South Arapaho peak and traversed to North Arapaho. Beautiful area, all those mountain lakes up there. The near daily thunderstorms threw me in for a loop though. I started at Rainbow Lakes campground and the clouds started rolling in around 12:30pm while I was just coming back from the North summit. That was a sketchy ass hike back down to the campground, those storms are no joke."
canada,ffdn36o,t3_esugva,1579824392.0,Sort by controversial. It’s fantastic.
AskAnAmerican,ffdg37j,t1_ffdfjg2,1579820139.0,"It's been about a decade since the last time I was in Central CA but from what I remember I was really struck at the vinyards and the towns. Places like Morro Bay or San Luis Obispo. I really enjoyed that area. Sleepy little surf towns with salt water taffee stores.

Since that time I've gotten in to hiking and scrambling so I would like to shift my attention to the Sierra Nevadas the next time I visit. It almost isn't fair how many options there are within a few hours drive of where most Californians live. You can ski and surf the same day. Be in the hot desert or on the foggy and rainy coast within a few hours. It's quite a state."
science,ffdc7fy,t3_estzoj,1579817780.0,"I think much of the waste from the household level is simply due to lack of knowledge of effective and easy tactics to minimize waste, eat healthy and eat affordably all at once."
science,ffdc1fu,t1_ffcb0gl,1579817671.0,"You just need to cook in bulk and know how to store it. You can save money and time doing that - while not wasting. There are also other things worth the investment - like a dehydrator or a vacuum sealer. 

I think people just aren't aware of very easy tactics to be used to eat healthy, cheaply, and with minimal waste. But those tactics do exist, and they aren't expensive either. In fact - what you'll save from employing these tactics makes them incredibly economical."
science,ffdbv13,t1_ffcgo5s,1579817556.0,Dehydrate my friend. You will never waste  a thing again.
science,ffdbrz7,t1_ffccwb6,1579817500.0,"This is what my GF doesn't understand. Preparing meals doesn't have to be incredibly time consuming, or expensive. In fact, it saves time and money. It just forces one to be a little bit more diligent when cooking. 

The best thing I ever bought was a dehydrator. You'd be astounded by the things you can dehydrate. From chili to leafy greens. Toss the dehydrated leftovers in the freezer - you're always one or two cups of hot water away from a meal - or you have tons of snacks all the time."
AskAnAmerican,ffdawg6,t1_ffckwk9,1579816916.0,"I'm excited to visit the western slopes at some point. I also have not seen the San Juans yet, they're up next summer."
AskAnAmerican,ffdas2v,t1_ffcl26l,1579816836.0,That Central Coast is so beautiful. Wow. Northern CA is beautiful too. That whole god damned state is gorgeous. I'm not a city guy so I had reservations about California because the thought used to provoke images of LA or SF. But after road tripping through the state I saw how much California has to offer an outdoorsman. It's a great state.
AskACanadian,ffd9n2d,t1_ffd94ui,1579816144.0,"More like NPR. I honestly can't tell you the name of the specific program off the top of  my head - but CBC radio often has segments that have NPR like commentary about Canadian political events. I'm not a big political junkie so I can't really give you more detailed info, but I'm sure there is more info on CBC Radio's website."
canada,ffd95x5,t1_ffd7bs6,1579815865.0,"Yeah it's a thing out here. Actually my roommate went to French immersion from K-9. But he apparently lost it really quickly once he was out of it. 

Where I live Dutch and Hutterisch are far more common and pervasive than French is. Obviously a regional anomaly - but considering the immediate exposure it always came across as strange to me as a kid that French was prioritized in schools. I still maintain that conviction. I see nothing wrong with learning French at all, I just think it would be more useful if we directed educating youths and adults alike based on what they want to learn as opposed to what we think they ought to learn."
AskACanadian,ffd7a4t,t3_eszk1p,1579814803.0,CBC radio honestly is the best I think.
canada,ffd6j78,t1_ffd39vd,1579814387.0,"Yeah it’s not a bad thing. It’s not like learning any other language is a bad thing - I just get frustrated with what I often see as a call to nationalism or duty to learn another language. I think that the utility of languages inspire bilingualism. 

So living in Montreal one would see very obvious utility for French. This is true for many areas of Northern Ontario, New Brunswick, even in areas of Manitoba and the northern prairies. 

But the perceived effort to learn French in areas with minimal exposure often is perceived to exceed its utility. It’s always an asset to know any language - in Canada it’s a more valuable asset to learn French than Cree, for example, for most people. 

However, it’s also an asset to learn Tagalog or Mandarin if you work in the service sector in Calgary or Vancouver. It’s an asset to learn Inuit dialects if you’re in a medical or social service profession in the North. 

I see evolution of language as very fluid - something a government shouldn’t be able to determine or dictate - or that is futile for a government to attempt to install or enforce (outside of discriminatory practices). So ideologically I admit some baggage regarding the topic of “Official Language” in general. I don’t think there should be any official language. But I’m sure I’m
In the minority."
canada,ffd5mi0,t1_ffd4h9a,1579813881.0,Oh I’m sure it has utility.  Don’t mistaken me. It’s never a bad thing to learn a second language. I think that the utility for French in the West and most areas of North America is just not quite as much of a pull for most people. That’s all I really meant by that.
canada,ffd58g2,t1_ffd30yg,1579813665.0,"Oh don’t mistaken me. Perhaps this came across like I am opposed to the idea of learning a second language. I am not at all opposed to that. I see that in and of itself an extremely valuable experience. I am fully in support of enhancing the ability to conceptualize things in different ways. 

I just often get frustrated with the call to nationalism or duty to learn two specific languages. I think that people should learn languages on their own accord - languages of their choosing. 

Keep in mind the success of Bilingualism is determined in large part to exposure. So in a world where English is, ironically, the Lingua Franca - learning a second language is seen with less utility in predominantly English speaking areas of North America."

Many thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffczdm3,t1_ffcz70g,1579810386.0,Very much appreciate the insight and the reply!
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffcyjbh,t1_ffcxgtx,1579809913.0,"I see. So when deferring this tax - is this basically the equivalent of having the 10k deducted from your income? IN other words - are contributions to RRSP's income tax deductible up to 18% of annual income, or are the earnings made in the RRSP the only contributions that are tax deductible?

If I'm going to bite the bullet and pay the full tax regardless of the contributions that I make to the RRSP this year, I guess maybe a TFSA would be just as good an option right? 

I'm a bit ignorant of this stuff so I apologize if this is annoying. I'm just a little confused about the potential tax deductions that come from an RRSP."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffcx2a2,t1_ffcwg5b,1579809060.0,"This is provincial, but very similar options. Not nearly as much as your friend has though. I basically had the option to keep it with them, or take the LIRA + lump sum. I have a lot of RRSP contribution room, so I figured I could deduct the lump sum from my income this year, reducing my income tax, and let the money grow in there and my LIRA. But, I'm not really sure if I'm missing something here."
