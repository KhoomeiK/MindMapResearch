Even if you write and tell them not to blame themselves they will, in addition by doing it this way they will also know that even though you were aware that commiting suicide would result in them blaming themselves you still decided to go ahead and do it anyway regardless of their feelings.Better to be honest with them. Maybe go and see them and tell them what your thinking about. They obviously mean enough to you that you are concerned about their feelings if you killed yourself. As your parents i think theyve earnt that much."
SuicideWatch,fcza1jp,t3_eb0t6b,1578096710.0,"Overdoses rarely work and a train is messy but most likely effective. if  you say you wont commit suicide if your worried about who will find you and the burden youll place on them then i think you need to make an appt to see someone. Anyone that cares that much about people must inately care about themselves, you cant do one without the other. This means its very unlikely you will kill yourself which is a good thing for you because deep down it doesnt sound like you want to. You sound like the kind of person that will have family&friends around them. Maybe talk to them."
SuicideWatch,fcz7ii0,t3_eiqazb,1578095241.0,"I was reading my post again and i hope that it didnt come across the wrong way. It is a genuine question i have around suicide. I often wondered whether people really wanted death when they attampted suicide so many times. I dont mean to put anyone down if theyve done this. I would genuinely like to understand how this works? I am suicidal and i do intend to kill myself. When i decided this is what i wanted i read up about it. I had heard of people that were unsucessful and i wanted to find out why and how i could avoid being one of these people. So i researched suicide and got stats on the best methods and most successful methods. Thats why i guess i found it hard to understand the many attempts some people have,. Its great tho if people get to see a Dr and it works out for them. This is not what i want but i understand for some people i guess its hard to ask for help so maybe they attempt suicide several times until they get the strength to ask."
SuicideWatch,fcz6eeb,t3_eiqazb,1578094600.0,"One thing ive never understood is when people mention how many times theyve attempted suicide. To me that says they never wanted or intended to kill themselves. Ive heard some people talk about how theyve tried 12 times or similar to kill themselves, honestly?? How can you get it that wrong? Killing yourself is very easy. You could understand getting it wrong once but certainly no more than that. Ive heard of people that have survived a gunshot wound to the head with terrible injuries. That i understand. Or maybe you used pills the first time because you didnt give it enough thought but the second time after reading about it a bit you realised that overdoses very rarely kill people so the next time you choose a method where you are much more likely to succeed. Thats what you would do if you were serious about killing yourself. If people ""attempt suicide"" multiple times doesnt it occur to them that they should probably just go and see someone as they obviously just want someone to notice them and pay attention to them and thats ok. Why else would they do this multiple times? Im sure if they were honest with themselves they would be able to say they never really intended to kill themselves. You just cant get it wrong that many times. Im going to kill myself. Ive done alot of research into the most lethal form of suicide. Ive tried to account for any possibility. A gunshot with the right gun, the right ammo in the right place is the best method. If by some freak event i survive this gunshot i will be in such a remote location that noone will find me and eventually i will die."
