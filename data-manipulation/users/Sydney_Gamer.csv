I don’t think it is so outrageous that Republicans are doing this, it is more just a good insight into how they feel. They are a huge percentage of the country, yet Fox and conservative radio have made them feel for years like a persecuted class.

This isn’t the best explanation but it shows the HOW. I’m sure there are better ones on YouTube. I think it is called Trachtenberg Method. 

That 4 digit one is cross multiplication. Another one is called the base method. Base method is how I usually do percentages I think. Maybe sometimes cross multiply. 

There are simplifications if the numbers are teens or whatever. 

For example notice math tests use numbers that end in 25 a lot? It is probably a number who’s 1’s digit is 5 because to square a number like 65 you just do 6x7 then shove a 25 at the end. 115 squared is 11x12 = 132 then shove a 25 on the end for 13225.
