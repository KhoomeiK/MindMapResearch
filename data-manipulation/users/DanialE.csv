Trump could bomb iran today and the cashier, chefs, farmers, etc will still go to work tomorrow like nothing happened. Dont need to worry about people serving a government.

Any gas at a certain temperature will have a range of velocities. It wont be all vibrating the same magnitude. And even if it starts all having the same velocity it would just diverge. Think about how atoms move and bounce off each other. Due to the random directions of atom collisions, some will bounce in such a way that they increase in velocity. If you mix water at 20C with same amount at 40C, it will be on average 30C. I digress, but in a bunch of gas atoms, some of them will momentarily reach escape velocity. And if this happens at the upper atmosphere theres a chance for a gas atom to receive that energy, moving in an upward direction, without losing that energy to other gasses(not colliding with anything anymore). If all goes well it just escapes.

Edit: for the gas collisions. Lets imagine an atom moves at unit speed 1 vertically up. Then another hits it horizontally left. The second will bounce perfectly horizontally right. While the first will gain a component in the left direction of unit 1 combined with its original 1 upwards. It now moves diagonally with sqrt(1 + 1) which is about 1.4"
