ManjaroLinux,fe84ltc,t3_eo1kij,1578922497.0,"Linux and Windows have different approaches towards memory utilization, so that will be worth looking into:

[https://www.linuxatemyram.com/](https://www.linuxatemyram.com/)

If that's not the case, then let's go by parts.

Do a  `$ free -m` and post it here.

Then let's check what might be using your memory. 

This command will tell you the processes that are using your memory sorted top to bottom (quit with q):

`ps aux | sort -rn -k 5,6 | less -S`

Then there's the interactive application called `htop` which is a bit more user-friendly than `top`. 

Here memory utilization is represented by colors:

* **Green**: Used memory
* **Blue**: Buffers
* **Orange**: Cache

There are four columns related to memory utilization:

* **VIRT** or virtual memory, related to everything included memory files (this isn't really your issue).
* **RES** or Resident size is physical memory used, however it does not include SWAP or shared memory.
* **SHR** or Shared shows if RES is actually shared with other processes.
* **MEM%** is the result of dividing RES by your physical RAM. <- This is what you're looking for.

Note: You might see some outrageous numbers in VIRT, but pay them no attention as some apps like browsers rely heavily in caching.

Post back what are your top ten suspects and lets see what might be the cause."

movies,fdmjb8n,t1_fdm3xw5,1578551978.0,"I think there were several horror movies with cat people, namely 'Cat People', 1942.  
There's a remake bearing the same name from 1982 that's not as compelling as the original, from Paul Schrader (He wrote Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, American Gigolo right before this).  


There's also Sleepwalkers, 1992, based on something Stephen King doodled in a napkin.

I think Spookies, 1986 also had a ""were-cat"" and might be entertaining if you're into terribly bad but good horror.

There are many more, although none worth watching in my opinion. Still the original is pretty great for a slow night.

I consider Avatar as a canon continuation on Cat People."

multilingualparenting,fcfc02p,t3_eh5xqs,1577628467.0,"In our case, I talk exclusively in a language and my partner does the other, while between us we speak in English as ""encrypted"" communication.

This lead to confusion for my eldest around 18 \~ 20 months in, as when she learnt ""carrot"" or ""banana"", realized that one of us will ""correct"" her. Eventually, after a couple of months she came to terms with us using different languages and now is natural for her to point things to us to hear each word.

That said, it requires a big effort from all three parties in my opinion, and my kid while she had a lot of vocabulary counting both languages, initially struggled to talk with her school mates as she was less skilled in their common tongue. This will bring a new set of issues and problems, but currently (preschool) she's merry as a cricket and speaks fluently both languages with ease, as much it can be expected from a preschooler.

For my youngest, he just saw his sister speaking both languages naturally and didn't have any hurdles to become fluent.

BTW: Playgroups in your husband's language may be very helpful."
