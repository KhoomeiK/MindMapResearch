VXJunkies,femz2nc,t1_femnx9t,1579273256.0,Wasn’t even thinking about cauterization but great point. Was more thinking if you have that many canisters your probably using at least 20 per duty cycle with their others as redundancy.
VXJunkies,fem2w4k,t3_eptvul,1579237960.0,"The easy answer maybe to re pasteurize them but here is what I have done to get around that in a pinch.

Did assemble as much as comfortable and fill with diesel fuel then ATF, then a final bath with carb cleaner, brake cleaner works too. Be sure to use micro fiber cloths when drying them off. I have also used the heated dry in the dishwasher when various women weren’t around. I’ve heard of people using the oven too. 

I’ve also been told that depending on your injected solution it may not react with any of those. 


What are you trying to accomplish that your rig takes 40 canisters? You may want to think about upgrading to a more efficient system. Dealing with that much energy means canister life cycles are probably relatively short, which means you have a decent margin for error in this process. 

Are these canisters intended to aid in or catalyze the reaction, cool/contain it, or harness a byproduct?"

VXJunkies,fds82eb,t1_fdrzks7,1578696474.0,"To echo that although I don’t know that I would say the same about DJHs field work I have yet to see sufficient data to convince me that this is a permanent or even temporary fix more then a Bandaid.

I don’t think it’s entirely fair to paint that picture about DJH alone. None of us who do this as a hobby on our own time have any where near the capability to see much at a genuine field level. 

I can tell you most if not all of my work stays within my lab/basement/connex box/trailer. And yes a lot of what I do is vectors or as some would refer to it simulations. 

Taking any of this to such a grand scale multiplies your variables exponentially. Even refining and verifying your control could take years to rule them all out. 

It is true that DJH does a lot of his work in calculations on paper which is why we do commonly hear about him having theories or hypthesises. 

I would be interested to see how much of it was proven or disproven if he did have the chance to go live with them. 

But for whatever reason he is either not interested or is being held back from doing so by other means. Very possibly the logistics and resources to do so at full scale. 

We shall see. The days of Scray taking an interest and sponsoring the work of those who they do not already employ seem to be over, and unfortunately it would take a big name like that with the resources for something like that to happen."
VXJunkies,fdrzoug,t1_fdqb6am,1578692150.0,"Fascinating your plan of action for trouble shooting is almost exactly the opposite of what I would have done myself. I assume then that you have auxiliary coolers plumbed into this rig and most upper hardware is modular replace when warped? 

How does your auxiliary cooling system work.  How is it driven and does it serve multiple rigs or just this one? 

It’s honestly not something I’ve thought about but it’s intriguing to say the least. I generally just over build my coolers to compensate for errors/accidents or what have you. 

I learned this after my first house burnt down and my 2nd wife let me."

VXJunkies,fdow2s2,t1_fdov79w,1578614194.0,I’m not worried. As a VXer living in a homestead I let most things that materialize roam. I am often curious if more are appearing or if they are reproducing.
VXJunkies,fdni60n,t3_ema4zq,1578586312.0,"So not to discount other posters but there has been a number of incidents where new VXers have synthesized sometimes living beings that have also appeared in the labs of anyone running their rigs with similar vector settings. Most notably the elephant incident a few years ago,

There is also a slight chance that this cat is not at all VX related."
VXJunkies,fdkis4q,t3_elt3id,1578504641.0,While I believe your right I would guess this is only a segment of the missing data. From what I know of the incident and those involved they are not the type of people to just have one set of readings. I would guess while this is a segment of one and at a cursory glance would hypothesize that these readings were taken onsite. I would bet Atleast one of my rigs that they have similar sets of data taken from multiple remote labs to get and idea of the impacts at various distances. It is also important to remember they had been doing these tests for Atleast 8 years and part of the reasons for the remote monitoring was to get an idea when the reactions would draw the attention of the public. The intent was to keep as much of the operations as possible in secret.

LookImAFirefighter,fdh0dzh,t3_el9jqx,1578412630.0,"Not condoning this as it doesn’t appear they are taking in a run but I could be wrong. I am guilty of the station run from time to time to ensure I get a seat. I still believe there is a proud heritage of volunteer fire service even if it has been bastardized in many parts of this great nation. Unfortunately we see the cringe from volunteer and paid staff alike granted it seems the vast majority come from the volunteer realm. This is not meant to be a “Same job” or volunteers are better post. Just to say we are guilty of the same if not similar crimes.

FordDiesels,fdg6nnl,t3_el84w5,1578382188.0,Depends on the blend. All diesel sold in Minnesota is Atleast b10 but I believe up to b20 now. Most newer trucks can run b20 without problem but carry a spare fuel filter just in case. I’ve run b99 in my 7.3s with no modification and no adverse effects.

VXJunkies,fd1w1pv,t1_fd1b8ps,1578137710.0,"As an independent contractor I do not have the liberty to say anything that isn’t already public knowledge. 

If you look back at posts within the last couple years you will find some discoveries made by hobbyists that didn’t make a ton of sense otherwise. Certain parties were very quick to discourage other users from attempting similar tests/settings/calibrations. 

Not a lot is known about what may or may not have been stumbled upon or what the intent was."
VXJunkies,fczq4f7,t1_fcz9af8,1578106640.0,Really good on /u/ggppjj and the folks at Scray for putting things together little earlier this year.
VXJunkies,fczq151,t3_ejn4f8,1578106591.0,"Ahh yes one of the few parts of the convention I not only attended but remember. I’ve heard some rumors but I’ll refrain from stealing the thunder from /u/ggppjj  and wait till Scray makes official announcements. 

Unless they have something fantastic up their sleeves which isn’t entirely out of the realm of possibility considering all their government contracting as of late I would expect to return to Tuscarora Nevada in the late summer and early fall.  

Again until the world forgets about the VX incidents and made Gary Indiana and more recently Baltimore the places they are today I don’t think we’ll be able to get any better of a location. 

We should count our lucky stars we haven’t been banished to a more logistically challenging location like when Australia was in the running. And although it was close to happening Detroit was ruled too close to the Canadian border.

If we don’t see anything as at least a teaser from Scray by the spring I would begin to get worried."

Dierks has yet to show any sign of carrying thus far and is portrayed to have just gotten out of bed. Thus it is unlikely he is currently carrying, I can see this going about 4 ways. 

Dierks either takes the beating he had coming of throws hands like a man. Or departs into the house to retrieve his weapon. 

Wayne is likely a smart enough man not to give chase into the house but his judgement may also be affected my his rage.
