Divorce,ffg9squ,t3_et9fab,1579901542.0,"I would go talk with your doctor to see if he could help..  Yes, eating healthy and getting any kind of exercise will help. But sleep is so important.  Your body is under a lot of stress.  One of my friends went thru a painful divorce and he had to take antidepressants for a while.  He is now doing great and NO regrets about the divorce."
adultery,ffdrqw2,t3_esvtjs,1579827308.0,I would focus on yourself and find another AP..
adultery,ffdrg3i,t3_et03af,1579827107.0,I would ask him playfully...  like you miss sex but not meee???    My AP of a few years will still say he misses me BUT I think he says that so I keep meeting him.
adultery,ffdqwoy,t3_et26ac,1579826762.0,Yes I have been doing this for years and the guilt comes and goes..  But each time I tell myself that I desserve to be happy and have some fun.   I know I would be miserable if I didn't have male attention in my life.
relationships,ffdppb6,t3_essm1j,1579826002.0,"When things settle down, just talk about it..  No need for her to be upset as talk is talk.   Prehaps she doesn't see a problem-- I'm being serious..   My Grandma did this to her 4 kids.   Nothing was discussed beforehand, so when she passed, the kids were a bit surprised and the one disowned the family.. even his siblings!!!!   Odd to see such a thing effect a huge family.   So yes, I would talk with her and see where she is coming from and then tell her how you feel."
cats,ffdobm2,t3_esun1g,1579825139.0,"Yes...   Just bought another cat tree/lounge or whatever it is..  Do we need it? No, but why not.."
adultery,ffb0ccy,t3_eshu47,1579748669.0,"They do..  Years ago this guy took me there a few different times..   It was a really nice place by the airport-- I was really surprised.  updated bathroom, fireplace and these jacizzi tub.     I guess a lot of ppl take long lunch breaks....  LOL"
adultery,ff9rh8o,t3_esfw3o,1579719500.0,"I would just ride it out until you 100% know.  Why disrupt the kids??  But then again life is short!!   Not sure I would leave for AP, leave for yourself."
adultery,ff9r97s,t3_esb1ad,1579719332.0,I don't care what others think...  It's therapy for me to come here and read that others are going thru the same as me...  I think if I didn't have an AP I would literally be in the crazy house.   I absolutely need someone else in my life.
pettyrevenge,ff7qxbq,t3_erqmir,1579656189.0,ha ha...  My son would do that with the router bit...       But yes sleep is so important to me that if spouse woke me up (he can't sleep that much so he doesn't care) that I would damn well make sure he doesn't sleep at all....  He is much better now and leaves me alone to sleep.
adultery,ff54alr,t3_erdfxr,1579579832.0,She sounds confused--   Stay away from her..
adultery,ff53ncu,t3_erntbs,1579579330.0,Yes..  I do feel like running away..   I feel like just packing my bags and going somewhere.
adultery,ff4wswc,t3_ergnul,1579574330.0,I'm so sorry you lost a good friend!!   : (    But I have thought about this with my AP--- how will I know?  I guess if he dissappears and never connects with me again.   We are in our 50's and he has joked around about us in our 70's...  I would certainly miss him...
adultery,ff24ioe,t3_er3562,1579493589.0,I go there too but I feel sorry for them and wonder why they stay especially when  they are so young..   Or wonder why they don't cheat to get some relief...
adultery,fev25iz,t3_eqh78x,1579392219.0,"I guess it just depends..  My AP and I  spend hours together and sometimes we do talk about our spouses or kids..  It's not bad stuff just general things and we enjoy listening to each other.  I don't think it ever dampens the mood.   Sometimes he will even ask about them (kids) like how are they doing with ??? if it's been a few weeks that we've seen each other.  I don't see anything wrong with it.    But yes, when I was dating another AP and I asked about his wife, he nearly bit my head off because this was 'our' time..   So this is why I said it depends."
adultery,feszyyp,t3_eqhg6c,1579370529.0,"This drives me crazy when I see profiles that say they are happy at home..  I'm like why are you looking then?   Or maybe it's my mood causing me to go back and forth.  But yes, I wouldn't say AP is happy at home but content but I know he loves his wife.  I wouldn't say I'm happy at home.  But when I feel content at home, I don't feel the need to see AP as much.  Prehaps I'm just fucked up in the head."
adultery,fephltj,t3_ept2aj,1579320703.0,Yes...  it's nice when that happens!!   : )
adultery,fepepj0,t3_eq42sc,1579318654.0,"When I was younger, I would as I enjoyed it.  Now I could care less and ignore them when they ask-like others have said, it takes so much time to get a good shot.   They can see me in person!!"
adultery,fenkqjs,t3_eq1nlg,1579286775.0,"Be patient...  They are on AM..  Men who want that mental, emotional, physical connection.  YOU have to do alot of weeding.   I delete many profiles that don't appeal to me---  disgusting pics, sex talk, nothing in their profile, etc....  But yes they do come around..  just met one today for coffee.  Nice professional guy but just not my type for a couple reasons.  Last week I met a guy and didn't think I would like but he has a beatituful soul.   So yes nice guys are on AM--  put what you  really want on your profile and see what happens."
adultery,feiidyv,t3_eoqayz,1579139236.0,"The profiles that say just for fun or I""m happy at home and need more...  I delete those..  I look for the profiles that want a relationship/connection first-- where they want the emotional part too.  I don't like FWB but I guess I have seen that listed in their profiles.."
adultery,feigih5,t3_ep717t,1579137995.0,"I don't think I ever left on a bad note..  But yes, I still communicate with a couple and yes I'm sure if I wanted to meet up again with the one, no problem.  I would say take the leap and reach out!!   What's the worst he can say?  He's busy..  I think there's a good chance that you'll meet up with him again!!"
adultery,fee8mhq,t3_eonltw,1579028653.0,"Thanks for sharing!!  I'm at that point now-- oldest will graduate HS next year and the baby will be done in two years.  So I'm staying a bit longer..    But then why do it in college and mess things up for them..  Spouse works a lot  which makes him stressed all the time and it's all he knows.     My guess when they are in college, I will have more time for my AP."
adultery,fedxvee,t3_eokphu,1579022194.0,"Yes.. I agree..  When he is gone, I do miss him!!"
adultery,fecfbmf,t3_eo8g8j,1578972556.0,"I think if it was just for sex, he would be gone already (onto the next).  But we meet quite often and it's usually for hours--  we also laugh and have great conversations..  So I think it's for both!!"
tretinoin,feceg68,t1_fe8o2dn,1578971967.0,Is that a reputable place to order??  Just wondering--
Divorce,fe023k5,t3_enh1ac,1578801156.0,"I don't love hubby anymore either-- I told him but I don't think he understood or thought I was serious.  He says he loves me but I don't feel loved at all---- I think he is content.    You could try counseling, you could also do a free consultation at a lawyer just to get more information."
adultery,fdtgud0,t3_emmb1g,1578716562.0,"I try to meet during the day so no need to explain myself..  And a meal in the crock-pot cuz I'm usually tired after sex and wine.  If it's a night or a weekend, I say it's shopping trip (I'll put shopping bags and a few items in  the  car the day before)..  Or yes, say I'm meeting a friend for dinner."
Marriage,fdsxlts,t3_emxqad,1578709265.0,"I think this is why people stop at the bar on the way home or errands...  But yes,  sometimes I sit in my car in a parking lot because I don't want to go home---  just want some peace.  I have a friend who takes a weekend trip by himself for that reason.."
adultery,fdswc4q,t3_en0eis,1578708788.0,"I do feel the same too...  At times I'm like why can't it be like this at home?  So warm and comforting.. sweet..calm.   I know he loves his wife but the way he is with me, I know something is there."
adultery,fdkd3s2,t3_elnygz,1578501332.0,"Maybe with the young immature ones that are looking for a booty call..  I pass on those-- I want the connection.  If I can't laugh and have a conversation with them, forget it."
adultery,fdipph1,t3_elj5px,1578448258.0,That's good...  but just be careful.  She could be lurking around just to make sure it was harmless!!
Marriage,fdap6y6,t1_fd8so2a,1578248584.0,"His anxiety issues. After our second son I stopped taking birth  control and he wouldn't get snipped.  He didn't want anymore and things were hectic with 2 kids under 2 so there was no time.  As the kids grew older we grew apart.  I thought he was gay at one point but I think he's either A-sexual or too anxious to have sex.  For the longest time, I thought it was me until I stepped out on my marriage.  He is defiantly missing out but I guess that's his choice. He doesn't want a divorce, just to continue  working and live like he is."
Marriage,fd6gu5g,t3_ejso5e,1578190802.0,Married 20 years and the last time we had sex was about 15 years ago.
Marriage,fd6g3o0,t3_ejzy8h,1578190467.0,"I think that's great that he wants you to work on yourself!!     Do exactly that-- take a class and do try a new healthy recipe--  I have done the recipe thing and it does feel good to try something different!!!   Take the dog for walks everyday. Go talk with a therapist, I have done this just to make sure that I""m not going 'crazy' with the issues I have. It our responsibility to take care of ourselves--- mental and physical."
Marriage,fd6eyz4,t3_ek0xn1,1578189964.0,"Nope...   I would not do that.. No way!!  I mean, I guess it could work out-- having another person there with you..  But I have also read that it can be a disaster after marriage.   Why go thru all that?   Tell your parents you want to go to college first..   Stick up for yourself!!"
Marriage,fd6dub5,t3_ek19t2,1578189463.0,"You can start walking together?  Walking would be great for him AND you can have serious discussions too  Years ago once the kids were off to school, he and I would walk around the neighborhood and I felt like we could really talk  about things because of the walking.  Here at home- our discussions aren't all that."
Marriage,fd6c7dj,t3_ejyudl,1578188744.0,"I'm sorry but at least he was honest with you!!!  I asked my spouse if he loves me and he says he does--- BUT he certainly doesn't show it.  I just wanted him to be honest with me.   No kids?-- this is good until you figure this out.  You are both young; try marriage counseling and if both are willing to work, it may pull you closer.  If not, then you'll have to decide to part ways."
adultery,fd69g81,t3_ejxgvj,1578187557.0,"I met a new guy couple years ago and after  a few dates he was so happy and excited..  He said that he loves me (I didn't and couldn't say it back) and that we are going to have a wonderful life. He went on and on about how he would take care of me...   I have no idea why he said all that--  In 2 years, we had sex once and lots of dinners out!!   Strange guy.  We still do dinners--it's nice to go out to different places and catch up."
cats,fczzpay,t3_ejlz4x,1578111421.0,That''s what I just said.. 'poor baby' he's feeling got hurt..  Too cute to run into mama's arms!!
DeadBedrooms,fczh01u,t3_ejlmcj,1578101052.0,"So sorry you are dealing with this..  Please don't let your MIL put the blame on you.  I would just let this go...  Be the best dad, spouse your can be-- let in-laws do their thing and go home.   Then when things settle, consider stepping out.   I know your hesitate but your happiness means something too."
adultery,fcxphlq,t3_ejb8f0,1578068412.0,"I'd be concerned too..   If he wants to meet up again, go ahead but tell him you are taking a break from anal sex..  Just to see.  If he starts making excuses to meet, then you know."
adultery,fcull2z,t3_eit6eg,1577983671.0,"Love it!!  Very powerful and wish I had your strength. Follow thru and stay strong--you absolutely have this!!..  Like you said, it will be really tough this year but in the end you'll be happy.  Best of luck, : )"
adultery,fcp349q,t1_fcp13zq,1577849003.0,But your right having a AP does show me what a healthy relationship is...   Never ending conversations which I absolute love!!  No topic is off limits like SO and he values my opinion.  He can laugh and joke around.   And he tells me how sexy I am..  I absolute need this in my life.
adultery,fcowp8n,t3_eib4po,1577843647.0,We haven't had sex in 15 years and he thinks our marriage is fine..  He can't hold a conversation and thinks our marriage is fine..  He really doesn't care how I feel but he knows our marriage is fine and we don't need counseling.  This is why I have an AP..
adultery,fch3k97,t3_eh7o7e,1577646914.0,"Yes you are. in trouble.  I thought her SO was going to walk in OR even her son...  YIKES   It might be HOT now, but if you guys get caught-- it won't be so hot."

adultery,fcbw33e,t1_fc5uwrl,1577591609.0,The collect messages are BS-- defiantly delete those.   I did  an auto reply--- 'I only respond to messages'.   I had to weed thru the profiles somehow--- I like conversations NOT just 'hey' or 'what's up'.
adultery,fcbu3zt,t3_egritc,1577590995.0,"I don't think I'll ever stop..   I have a great AP now  and he 'jokes' around about continuing in our 70's--  we are in our 50's...  But really, I'm sure I'll stop when it's not enjoyable anymore or if physically I can't."
adultery,fcbsxx4,t3_egqtl7,1577590616.0,Yes very frustrating!!   I had an AP years ago and he had a lot of guilt.  He told me he was raised NOT to do this and he can't have a relationship with 2 women..  Soooo I had to let him go.   It was tough and I was very sad.   I have another AP now but still think of the EX-ap.
adultery,fcbrgvw,t3_egu4v6,1577590151.0,Stop talking to him and move on.  He is not worth your time!
adultery,fcbp6om,t3_egxbaw,1577589435.0,"Years ago I thought affairs were disgusting..  Why not divorce, right? Well, he doesn't like conversations or intimacy (I'm lucky I have 2 great kids out of it). Doesn't want to participate in any marriage counseling or therapy for himself. He doesn't want a divorce so  I know he would make it a lot harder than necessary if I filed.  He just wants to left alone and work.  He's a great provider and  needs a 'mom'/cheerleader here. And the 'family life' is a cover-up for him instead of being alone and single. Kids are in HS so I only have a few more years before they are off.  At first I felt guilty but the more he refused help and in denial about our marriage (which he thinks our marriage is fine), the more I felt like I deserved a great AP."
DeadBedrooms,fcalvdb,t1_fc8rc75,1577571820.0,"Yes, I have learned to ignore it mostly but starting to resent him."
Marriage,fcal1cr,t3_egq54d,1577571309.0,"I have considered hearing aids so I can turn the volume..  Yes, there are ear plugs and my older friend says when her spouse in a 'mood' of complaining and throwing tantrums, she puts on earphones and plays music thru the house."
adultery,fcakpn3,t3_eguivn,1577571113.0,Nope...  I think he should be bending over backwards for you!!
DeadBedrooms,fc7fl27,t3_egd3fj,1577505941.0,"I hear you!!   I hate mine too..  God is looking out for me cuz SO is getting what he deserves.  He has anxiety which causes him to be angry, stressed and say mean things-- now he is having daily headaches along with a few other things!!!   I'm not an evil person but it's what he deserves for being such a horrible person."
adultery,fc7dqh1,t3_egha7l,1577504413.0,"He got caught YEARS ago and I was really upset..  She knew tidbits but not the whole story.  Harassed me on Linkin (Thank-god, I had a fake name).  She did give him a hard time-- announcing it to all their friends which he denied..  She knew something was up but I think he got away with it eventually.   Sadly that ended our relationship..  I found another but still hopeful he'll come back around sometime.  Try to take it easy-- your are single and dating another. Like someone else said, he might be really good at fobbing the whole thing off.  : )"
adultery,fc66sk8,t3_ege2ou,1577473576.0,"I thought affairs were gross. But when my own marriage wasn't fulfilling, I had no choice.   SO doesn't want a divorce nor does he care to try work on himself or our marriage.  I've tried so many times to get our marriage on track.  The affairs have been really good for me-- I think it helps me stay sane to be with someone who wants to be with me, makes me laugh, makes me feels sexy, someone who enjoys deep conversations about anything.   And someone who actually cares to ask about my day.   I also believe when I'm 80- rocking in my chair, I'll have memories to grin about. : )    So for me it's not a waste a time."
adultery,fbwhh8k,t3_een381,1577150045.0,"Neglectful spouse whom I resent,  hosting his family of 30 X-mas Eve, AP is with his happy family, my teens have busy lives-- I""m just here trying to get thru until holidays are over.
