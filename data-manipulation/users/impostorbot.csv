The news likes to show people what they (the news) like. For example here in the middle east I remember seeing the same report saying ""president Obama showed his full support of..."" and then proceed to praise the thing, and another news agency would say ""president Putin expressed opposition towards..."" and then dispraise the same thing. Here a lot of people either dislike both America and Russia but admit they're world superpowers and therefore must be smart, or don't care about either but still acknowledge that they're smart, so the news would use that as a way to convince people with their views"
