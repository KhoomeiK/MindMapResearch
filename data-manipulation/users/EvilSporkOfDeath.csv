dontstarve,ffpqxfw,t3_eueeuw,1580102567.0,The geckos are a *good* thing. Build a 3x3 tile pen for them and place chester in the middle (his presence is enough to startle them and drop their grass tail everytime it regrows). Free grass. Who doesnt love free grass?

chess,ffj6aq8,t1_ffj3agh,1579991484.0,Why so dramatic. It's very simple. Just dont put spoilers in the title. You dont have to avoid discussion. Also dont resort to hyperbole like here
conspiracy,ffj5zut,t1_ffisvb5,1579991265.0,Let's be honest. It's less about the quality of a megathread and more about the endless spam of this one subject. Its taking up almost the entire front page of the sub with many completely redundant posts. It gets old fast.
