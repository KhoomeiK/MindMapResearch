IBO,fdvfu5l,t1_fdocj87,1578747013.0,How was it with the group 4 project?
IBO,fdvfmg6,t1_fdo10qi,1578746927.0,"Hello again!

I have a question.

Did your friend already start with the group 4 project when he changed from Bio HL to history HL?"
IBO,fdqkfyh,t1_fdocj87,1578668826.0,"Hello there,

I really hope it works. As I mentioned before, I underestimated DP biology. I'm glad it worked out for you :D

Thank you."
IBO,fdqk13q,t1_fdo10qi,1578668546.0,"Hello!

Not gonna lie, this gives me hope! I just don't feel like bio was made for me, it's a struggle for me and I feel like it will be one of the main factors of failing the IB. I am gonna talk to my coordinator and see what happens.

Thank you."
offmychest,fdewkrh,t1_fdesisk,1578348104.0,It doesn't really fit our circumstances.
offmychest,fdev1z5,t1_fdet1m6,1578347198.0,"I did ask her and she said: ""You're too young to understand this."" So, I gave up. He can't reschedule and I really want this. Oh gosh, I sound desperate. But, I can't rebel, it won't be a good idea, right?"
entp,fcijr1e,t1_fcijo3u,1577663711.0,Pretty straight forward.
offmychest,fc726gz,t1_fc6efal,1577495552.0,"Thank you! I needed to hear that.

It is the stigma of ""Middle eastern girls are not allowed to date"" that scares them away. It is very strange but also so annoying to follow the stereotypes. I feel like people will always see this stigma around my dads ethnicity."
offmychest,fc6ahcr,t1_fc6a2fq,1577476024.0,"I hope you never get put in this situation. Like, don't get me wrong, they are extremely nice and understanding. But, his mom threw me off a bit. She said it while I was talking to him over the phone. I just don't know how to fricking get this off my mind."
offmychest,fc69vsk,t1_fc69hie,1577475622.0,"Hi!

Man, exactly! It bugs me so much, like, they see one Persian person and BAM, we have another annoying person. It makes me feel like I should try harder to become more white and less Persian. I just feel like his mom will always see my dad and even me as ""Oh, those Persians...""."
offmychest,fc67z9a,t1_fc67iue,1577474365.0,"Hello!

I definitely agree, if I was more ""Persian"" or whatever that means, maybe she would be sorta iffy about it. I just feel sad about it. My boyfriend keeps reassuring me that he does not think like that, but, we are all sorta judgemental if we are going to be honest here. He has mentioned his mom having bad experience with a Persian neighbor.

Like, should I feel bad? I mean, since we are all sorta ""prejudice"" should this even bother me? She said he should adapt more to this society because he is ""here"", which I definitely agree with, but still, not cool. I love him and these ethnicity differences should not ruin stuff. And besides, I have met some white fathers that are this ""strict""."
