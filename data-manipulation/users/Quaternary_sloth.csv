funny,ff9ullq,t1_ff9ky79,1579721727.0,"Hah. It was a joke, even back in 05/06 when I worked at BBY. I was “not good enough with computers” to work in the Geek Squad. It actually meant I was “not good enough at sales”. At that point I was doing work for several small offices on my time off and working on my CS degree. I ended up telling the manager to fuck off in front of a customer after he berated me for not selling a PSP on a printer. Fuck you Ricky."

The kicker, the lock cables were simply looped around the leg of the desk. You could easily lift the desk leg up, slip the cable off and be on your way. Still cracks me up."

ThatLookedExpensive,fd3kw5m,t1_fd2vg5w,1578159258.0,Costa Rica was so incredible. We also were nearly washed away by a flash flood in 2012. Well the bridge went out moments before the van crossed it. Ended up hitching a ride in the pouring down rain in the back of someone’s pick up truck. Rubber boots and machetes were commonplace. Highly recommend visiting to anyone who hasn’t!
