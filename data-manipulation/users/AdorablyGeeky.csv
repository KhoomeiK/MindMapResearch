I think one is a chocolate truffle and the other a dulce de lecce. Both of those are good, better than some of the high end donuts I've had at the fancy places."
AskReddit,ffap7vi,t3_esl2jh,1579741255.0,"I remember a time when I was maybe 17 or 18, I was working summers at a local theme park. I'm not sure how it happened but I ended up going to a co-workers friends house instead of working. Maybe it was raining so we were sent home, I don't remember (I'm 43 now). Anyhow at said co-workers friend house with a bunch of his friends, listening to music, there was some alcohol but I was a 'good girl' so I didn't have any, we all just chilled and chatted, drinking. I ended up taking the bus from wherever I was back to the theme park to meet my dad for a ride home. 

At the time I vaguely remember it was fun and very casual but adult me realizes how dumb that was, and how anything could have happened."

He sees money as a transaction - you pay $5, he pays $5. If you give a gift, its not the same in his mind. 

Does he give gifts? Maybe but I'm betting probably not, it's just not part of his money mindset."
