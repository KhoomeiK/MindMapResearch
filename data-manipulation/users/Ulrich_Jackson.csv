oddlysatisfying,ffhxree,t1_ffhvjob,1579958501.0,"First time at ALDI I remembered someone told me that. Put the back of the key in and boom, cart acquired. What I did not learn was that generally when checking out of ALDI, you use the cart of the person in front you to collect your goods. As this became clear and the line was stacking up I began to see the writing on the wall. I had no choice but turn myself in, accept the awkward reprimand from the cashier, do some in line cart finagling to put the cart key in and retrieve my key. 

It’s worth just using the quarter or asking to borrow one."
YouShouldKnow,ffhv9gt,t1_ffhkvaa,1579955517.0,Yea I don’t know what rule I broke?
YouShouldKnow,ffhezbr,t1_ffheupu,1579932469.0,Just messaged them and hoping to get that cleared up.
YouShouldKnow,ffherrw,t1_ffheft6,1579932239.0,"Look up [PureHM](http://www.purehm.net)  I spent a few days with them training up on some of their survey equipment. Great great operation. Will probably take some work to get into but it’s definitely worth it. 

They specialize in long line pipeline surveys. CLOSE INTERVAL SURVEYS, ACVG, DCVG. Try to look those up and familiarize yourself with the technical definitions of certain terms."

YouShouldKnow,ffh7oub,t1_ffgzqhm,1579925455.0,"I typed up this long response with some basics so I’ll paste it here and if you have any questions after reading it. Please hit me up. 

 I’ll give you a little rundown of some basics. Obviously you can google Cathodic Protection (known in the industry as CP work) and learn about what it is and how it works. 

To start, only 2 things prevent underground piping from corrosion. That is a coating (usually painted on) and Cathodic protection (to protect the large and microscopic areas the coating fails to protect). I bring these two up because there are PLENTY of careers in both. CP certifications go from CP-1 to CP-4 and Coatings inspection certifications range from CIP-1 to CIP-3. 

I work in CP and some important things to do and know is first Ohms Law - It’s basic but it is the fundamental  equation for all our work. We use sacrificial anodes underground to protect steel/metallic piping from corroding using the galvanic properties of different materials. DC circuits, AC, series and parallel circuits are the building blocks. The “bible” for most technicians is called ‘Peabody’s Control of Pipeline Corrosion’ This book is great and I would highly recommend buying and reading it. 

So there are some different ways to work in the industry as far as employers go. You can approach pipeline operators (E.G. Colonial Pipeline, Sunoco, Dominion, Columbia gas, Energy Transfer Equity, Gulf South Pipeline - these are all “Transmission” companies. You can also look for local “Distribution” companies that deliver gas to homes)...or you can look for engineering companies or consultants that work for those operators. Simply put, working for the operator will provide great job security, benefits but less pay than a consultant. Working for a consultant will generally require travel, worse benefits, higher work load, but more pay. 

Both tracks usually will put technicians on the pathway (generally paid by employer) of completing CP certifications (CP-1, CP-2, CP-3, and CP-4). The CP 4 is equivalent to a PE engineer and is considered the most qualified Corrosion Technician. Each certification is extremely difficult to attain but if your able to study and be disciplined, you’ll have no trouble. They are week long courses, 10 hours a day of class and 2 hours at night to study more. There is a practical exam and a computer based exam at the end and if you fail it’s essentially about $5,000 down the drain for the company or yourself if you decide to put yourself through the course. 

As far as finding work, I can recommend a few companies to approach who are in your area. With no experience in CP, I would recommend refreshing your resume to reflect any basic mechanical skills you may have along with any experience working with basic electrical circuits. If granted an interview or phone interview you’ll want to explain how you are currently reading Peabodys textbook and genuinely interested in becoming a technician. People can smell bullshit and people who are just looking to punch a clock and do the bare minimum. 

In my experience, employers are interested in the character of a person more than the qualifications (when it comes to entry level) 

When it comes to compensation, it can vary greatly but where you start is not at all where you have to be forever. NACE (National association of corrosion engineers) puts out a study every year of average salaries of technicians broken down by region, CP Cert level, type of work etc. Definitely check out www.nace.org and use ALL available resources.  

Also, plenty of scholarships and resources available to people who apply. Look into Materials Performance magazine and CORROSION Journal.

Again, 100% check out NACE.org  They have so many resources that are free (and some behind a membership paywall)

I apologize if this is all over the place. I’m on my phone.

YouShouldKnow,ffh7l5b,t1_ffgxqz8,1579925367.0,PECO or PGW. Both are great companies and would 100% be worth looking into.
YouShouldKnow,ffh7ie8,t1_ffgx9i4,1579925302.0,"Yea if they find the right candidate, they’ll provide training."
YouShouldKnow,ffh62up,t1_ffh5eko,1579924126.0,"If you can. Make a trip to Morgantown, WV May 12-14th. Anyone of those days and sign up for the Appalachian Underground Corrosion Short Course (AUCSC). It’s a big corrosion conference and it’s a fantastic networking opportunity. Meet with companies, many of whom will be hiring."
YouShouldKnow,ffgvz5e,t1_ffgvpli,1579916460.0,Accurate. What they said^^^^
YouShouldKnow,ffgvwyt,t1_ffgvo39,1579916416.0,"Honestly no, the majority of work can be done with basic hand tools and a fluke multimeter."
YouShouldKnow,ffgvkvt,t1_ffgv5yx,1579916168.0,You’re welcome! Let me know if have any questions.
YouShouldKnow,ffgs16u,t1_ffgruru,1579913587.0,Totally agree with this! I used CAD in high school (circa 2005) and it actually helped me with my first job. Huge learning curve to use it for professional drawings but hey. Fake it till you become it!
YouShouldKnow,ffgrv2g,t1_ffgrcmn,1579913463.0,Look up PG&E. They have a corrosion department you may be able to make contact with.
YouShouldKnow,ffgpndu,t1_ffgpd84,1579911875.0,"There is one sure way to fail and that is to not try. I can’t imagine what you’ve had to go through but also, use that to your advantage. Think of the strength you’ve developed by having to deal with that kind of illness. You come back to the workforce with a desire to learn and ability to be reliable and you’ll be just fine!"
YouShouldKnow,ffgorpg,t1_ffgodw5,1579911254.0,"That’s awesome, congrats!"
YouShouldKnow,ffgnnd8,t1_ffgm4x6,1579910465.0,"Ummm yea, you may want to find a larger company that can take on part time workers. Corrpro, Matcor, Mears Group are some good ones to look into."
YouShouldKnow,ffgnhpk,t1_ffgmcxl,1579910355.0,"So I don’t specifically know anyone in that area. But, you should definitely look for any ongoing infrastructure projects in your area. Bridge building, building construction, pipeline construction, and find out who is performing that work and talk to them. One things I’ve been telling people is to not be afraid to cold call a company. Ask to speak with an engineer and try to pick their brain about job openings, work that is in demand, if they know of any other companies that may be a good resource. Things like that a super helpful and can lead to a great job."
YouShouldKnow,ffght4r,t1_ffgh89i,1579906550.0,"Damn, yea there is never a shortage of challenges. What’s awesome is that if you do get bored, you can usually find other work in the field that will then challlenge you"
YouShouldKnow,ffghofn,t1_ffggjug,1579906466.0,Yea that sounds super tough. Electrical engineering compounded with experience in Cathodic Protection. I’m not shitting you when I say you could do a good 6 figures in 5 years or less. Get your PE and CP certs and I’ll be working for you someday.
YouShouldKnow,ffghib2,t1_fffsidu,1579906353.0,Haha that’s real money buddy
YouShouldKnow,ffghg6v,t1_ffgdjf4,1579906315.0,"Stay positive on the side of honesty. I don’t know if that makes sense but it’s how I go about it. It’s okay to be bluntly honest, it will allow the interviewer to level with you but you need to keep it upbeat and really highlight the positive aspects of what may be mundane or generic. It shows you have a spark and are probably easy to get along with. It’s like voting. People don’t vote on policy, they vote with their gut. Appeal to the gut. Haha. I could be wrong. But it’s worked for me thus far"
YouShouldKnow,ffgh71o,t1_ffgcf54,1579906151.0,I used to live in Sanford! Haha and yes there is certainly work down there too.
YouShouldKnow,ffgh5br,t1_ffgbl6p,1579906122.0,You’ve got to believe in yourself. It sounds corny but it works. You’ve gotta know that you can bring something special to the job. Make a website for yourself. Clean up your resume. Apply for other jobs that you don’t want just to go to an interview and practice your interviewing skills. Seriously. You’ve got to set yourself apart. Keep up the good work!
