AirBnB,ffgp1or,t1_ffgjj7n,1579911449.0,">I mean, to make iced tea, you still have to brew it with hot water. You literally just add the ice. It’s not rocket science. She’s not an asshole because someone doesn’t understand that you just have to add ice to warm/hot tea. Especially if the establishment has already served them any kind of iced tea before. I’m all for sticking up for a server. But some of them make excuses for not wanting/not knowing how to do something which I don’t stand behind. The server could’ve asked someone if she really had 0 clue what to do.

No idea what watering down tea with ice has to do with this."

Then you chipped in and said but I saw individuals do this in USA and Canada (which you assumed were nice?). One is about societal norms the other is about people deviating from those norms. Best of luck and hope that cleared it up for you.

>- Guy tried to bargain at our counter. Like - ""Oh, $10, I'll give you $8!"" I was running the counter, so I played stupid: ""I need a managers key to change pricing, I'm so sorry."" Who does that?
 

This is not a scam. Just someone trying to haggle with a small business. Happens all the time in retail. 

>- Someone started asking questions on our Facebook DMs ""Who is the owner of your company?"" It was shady as hell, so I just responded ""We are owned by several members"" just in case this was a legitimate request or opportunity. Nothing was asked as a followup. 

Probably just wanted to complain, your local gov likely has that info available to the public. 

>- We make jewish foods that are what you'd find in a kosher deli or supermarket, but we are not koshered - we follow the practices but don't see the value in going the extra step for the certification. One guy came to our counter furious that we are serving bacon. I told him that we don't serve ANY meats. We realized that he bought something with smoked onions in it, and I ended up taking his complaint as a compliment

smallbusiness,fe6q72v,t3_enqv93,1578900268.0,"Not me. Had a relative, new to the USA, open up a cake shop in a rural town.

One day she hears a knock at the back door. It's a man and woman is business attire. There car looked  governmenty, if that makes sense. Anyways, they flash some badges and let her know that  they are secret service on a counterfeit case and ask to see the money. They then find that all the large bills are fake, and ask to see the safe. Finally, they take some information to return the money if it turns out to be real. 

Well they were just scammers. Could of just as easily robbed the place, as she was the only business on the block and the cake shop was always empty. Glad no one was hurt."
