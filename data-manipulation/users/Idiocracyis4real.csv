Historical Global Tropical Cyclone Landfalls*
July 2012
Jessica Weinkle
Center for Science and Technology Policy Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado

“The analysis does not indicate significant long-period global or individual basin trends in the frequency or intensity of landfalling TCs of minor or major hurricane strength. The evidence in this study provides strong support for the conclusion that increasing damage around the world during the past several decades can be explained entirely by increasing wealth in locations prone to TC landfalls, which adds confidence to the fidelity of economic normalization analyses.”

“Consideration of spatial and temporal changes in U.S. tornado activity continues to capture the attention of the scientific community (e.g., Ashley 2007; Elsner et al. 2015; Agee et al. 2016) as well as in the context of possible climate change effects (see Widen et al. 2015).
