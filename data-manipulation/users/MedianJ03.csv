Bipolar disorder or depressive disorder are a thing. Additionally low T can cause other health problems but one of which is a feeling of being overwhelmed all the time.

unpopularopinion,fedtbpi,t3_eohbok,1579019448.0,"I am like this. AND I also am frustrated and grew up frustrated by the culture around me. Many women seemed to lose interest in me if I didnt try to put my hands down their pants on the first date. 

I always wanted things to be a bit more organized than that. I wanted to feel like I had some trust in and respected the woman I was with before I was physical with her. And that takes some time to get to know them on a mental or emotional level. 

Lots came and went before I could get 3 dates in. Eventually I just started pushing my own boundaries and figured that I pretty much had to be physical on the first outing or they wouldnt stick around for the second. I kind of gave up on my desire for personal connection or interest when I couldn't find it. Then I became less interested in others just as they had shown no interest in me and dating became a sad way to masturbate with someone else involved which sucked. 

I found a couple women over the years who seemed to havr a loving nature and were someone Incoukd have an emotional connection with. One moved away for work and a few years later I met the one I'm with currently. 

But I find that peoples behavior around dating in general is pretty short sighted, appalling and down right hurtful to themselves and their partners, and it's hard to get away from it because it's an entire culture that seems to have lost the idea that these people your sexing, are actual human beings and should be treated well.
