nottheonion,ffeki2c,t1_fetv2mw,1579851833.0,I went to community college near a real uni and racked up enough tickets at the uni to get towed on site. The tow lot was just a parking lot on campus because presumably you needed to pay the tickets to graduate. Best part was that I could literally see it from my apartment balcony. Even saw them drop off my car one morning
nottheonion,ffek8ce,t1_fet8kz2,1579851489.0,"I went to Blinn which is a community college north of Texas A&M. All my friends were at A&M and lived on campus so I and would often ""illegally"" park in the lots. I racked up like $600 in parking fines (which i didn't have to pay since I didn't go to the school). One of the parking people said I was classified as a ""scofflaw"".

It got to the point where they would tow my car on site but instead of taking it to a real tow lot it was just to a parking lot out in the campus boonies that you could just drive out of with no hassle. Best part is you could see the lot from my apartment. I'll never forget having a hungover cigarette on my balcony and literally watching as the tow truck dropped my car off."
