MedicalCoding,fdm2anx,t1_fdlyozw,1578538112.0,"My major is definately unrelated to healthcare but it is still a degree, so for some positions it will count. From that point I would recommend reading about different certifications and different types of coding to see what interests you. Then look at education requirements, so once you are certified will you have to test again and/or obtain continuing education units (CEUs) and how much does that cost? You can call AHIMA and AAPC to ask questions too."
MedicalCoding,fdlwymh,t1_fdkyxlz,1578534491.0,"At the time I choose to make a career of coding, I already had a Bachelor's degree. Where I live I see a lot of companies require a college degree to move into management. So my coding certifications are a supplement to my degree making me more marketable for management positions. If your plan is to move into management but you do not have a college degree, AHIMA has RHIA and RHIT programs that are comparable to a college degree along HIM career paths. So where you see yourself 5-10 years from now should determine how you compare each company and the certifications it offers."
MedicalCoding,fdkpz64,t3_ejjdrf,1578508731.0,"I would say they are fairly equal, but you might want to think more about your career path before choosing. AHIMA will have certifications that take you father in career upward mobility. If you already have a 2 or 4 year degree, AAPC is a good supplement for specified knowledge of the job. Try to think long term and pick certifications that can take you where you want to go."
