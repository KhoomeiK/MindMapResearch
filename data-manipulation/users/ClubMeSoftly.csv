I really like how vocal Nora has become, how she's so quickly and passionately stepped up to advocate for Mantle and its people (Mantalians? Mantaliens? Mantlepieces?) especially after being a quarter-step above Comic Relief for so long.  

Likewise, I like how Ren fell in line under Ironwood. Two different responses from Nora and Ren about the same issue, and how the ghosts of their past formed who they are. Their desires and regrets, and the ""if it happened today I would [x]""  

I liked Yang's continued characterization from her ""no more secrets"" opinion. How she *wouldn't* fall in line under one conspiracy, and now she's refused to fall in line with another. Despite this, she trusts her sister and leader where it counts.  

In addition, her and Blake dealing with the fact that you can slaughter Grimm of all kinds until you drop where you stand from exhaustion, and not feel any emotion about it, but killing a man is a night-and-day difference. No matter the context.  

Whitley, who had previously been assumed to be nothing more than his father's son, and was outright categorized as a villain in some circles, is revealed to be nothing more than a sad, lonely, boy, desperate for someone to love him. The double-edge on Willow's phrasing back during the dinner party: ""After all, you left us with him.""  
The *Us* could be the parents, or it could be the Schnees by blood. Either way, especially with Klein gone, and Whitley greeting visitors, he's far worse off, but hopefully he can get help out of the mire.  

Ruby struggling with the choice between what's right, and what's good (I think that was the line. Please correct me if it's not) and Qrow's reassurances that she's already doing better than Ozpin was. She's trusting others, and sharing information while it's relevant, and holding back on other things. Not being *too* free with the secret knowledge.
