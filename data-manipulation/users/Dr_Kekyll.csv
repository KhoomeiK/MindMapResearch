leagueoflegends,ffwpu1u,t3_evlthw,1580308064.0,"I don't think it's as much related to lack of time people have, but it's really, really hard to still play league after that long. The game is entirely different (for the worse in my opinion) and speaking of my friend group, we all stopped playing a couple years ago after starting together at the beginning of 2013 (season 4 maybe?).

I can't stand riot games incessant need to complicate the game and add bullshit mechanics/OP/broken legends constantly just trying to stay relevant. It all started with legends like Gnar and is really just hitting a peak with absurdly busted and overly complicated legends like Aphelios.

I remember people bitching about Yasuo's W years ago saying it was adding a broken mechanic to the game and how OP it was. Those were the days. TLDR is we all still game, but we gave up on League because it's not a fun game anymore and the online gaming market is better and more competitive than ever."
EscapefromTarkov,ffv9g4p,t1_ffv8lhj,1580258835.0,"It's a beta, it doesn't have color blind options. While that sucks for people with disabilities, they're not forcing you to play, so I'm not going to have sympathy for people who use third party software to modify their game."
EscapefromTarkov,ffurr60,t1_ffukv7f,1580248107.0,"Nor have they ever stated that they agree with it's use, so you're just as biased for using it as I am for not using it. As a matter of fact, I'd say my ""bias"" is substantially more justified by the pretty obvious fact that the game devs didn't build any of that bullshit into the graphics settings. You think they just forgot to? Or do you think that MAYBE, they don't want it in the game? MAYBE I'm actually in the right, as I'm clearly siding with the developers here, and NOT using 3rd party software to alter the way the game operates. Hmmmmmmm."
EscapefromTarkov,ffurg44,t1_ffuhfhz,1580247930.0,"I'm going to ignore the vast majority of that comment, because I don't care anymore and believe you're fundamentally wrong. However, the last part is what gets me. ""Part of these people that won't accept others have right to do as they will too"". Yeah, you're cheating. Even if it isn't aimbot, it's still cheating. You don't have a right to cheat, so you're absolutely correct that I don't believe you have the right to do it just because you want to."
Amd,ffugh57,t1_ffsi32r,1580241448.0,That shouldn't be the case either. Actual companies with real customer service that back their products would ship you a replacement with a return label. Even shit show companies like Dell and HP will frequently do that with parts from their machines that are user replaceable.
Amd,ffugbey,t1_ffrycff,1580241354.0,What happens if something were to happen to the card during disassembly/reassembly? If be willing to put money on it that XFX would give you the run around to replace it since you willfully took apart the card and apparently didn't do it correctly.
Amd,ffug6i2,t1_ffruvlx,1580241273.0,"If it was a respectable company, they'd ship you a replacement with a return label for the old card. They made a defective product and it shouldn't be on the consumer to fix it, even if YOU personally would like to be able to."

Especially since big streamers (Summit) are shamelessly using it and they'd undoubtedly get negative attention by removing it since he'd bitch about it. But I still fully expect they'll remove support of it eventually, they just have a lot of other shit to worry about currently that's more important."

EscapefromTarkov,ffu6dec,t1_ffu5dvv,1580235443.0,"If you're referring to using your monitors settings to increase contrast or brightness then the answer is yes, that's still cheating. But there's no way for anyone to see that except you, so you can just get away with that shit. It's also ***substantially*** less efficient to do that at the hardware level than the software level. You can get wayyyyyyy more done by using Reshader softwares than you can ever do with a monitor. Reshading software is literally changing the data that is being sent from your PC on a fundamental level, whereas changing colors on your monitor is taking that data and interpreting it differently in a very inefficient and rudimentary way. Add on top of that the fact that Reshader shit can work to specifically boost *specific shades of colors* rather than just all greens, reds, blues, yellows etc. makes it way easier to abuse and get an unfair advantage. And then on top of that again, software will almost always apply to just the game, rather than all display data (desktop, webpages, etc) making it AGAIN, easier to abuse. Most people don't fuck with changing their monitors color levels because of how shitty that works. It's *almost like* reshader software was made for a reason or something.

As I said, if you're just talking about a higher quality monitor that's is better at color accuracy and has a better refresh rate or whatever, that's clearly not cheating that's just displaying the game more accurately and closer to they way it was intended. But artificially changing color balance, brightness, or contrast is absolutely cheating."
EscapefromTarkov,ffu5ivf,t1_ffu4yee,1580234934.0,"People say trees are gray in the game but they really only are when it's overcast/raining. Go to reserve or Customs when it's sunny and it's still a beautiful game, and is actually very true to life. They do go *slightly* overboard with the monotone look when it's raining, but it's not that far off still. People are literally just too used to cartoon video games like the Black Ops series of CoD's and shit that they forgot what trees actually look like."

The game is specifically designed to look this way because that's how they want to convey this type of war-like environment."
EscapefromTarkov,ffu44vd,t1_fftzlkc,1580234090.0,"It isn't just more color, even if you want to think it is. It increases the contrast as well which is specifically advantageous in tactical shooters. There is a reason there is not a contrast setting (or gamma for that matter) in the settings menu, because it can easily be abused and gives an unfair advantage. For the goofy ass monitor argument, I already talked about that in a different comment and I won't be repeating it, but TLDR is that is a hardware difference, not a software difference, and isn't modifying anything but rather displaying it more truly."
EscapefromTarkov,ffu3sux,t1_ffu2bym,1580233880.0,"Absolutely and completely different argument. Different (or better) hardware doesn't edit the game, all it does is display the game closer to how it is intended to be displayed by the creators. In fact, I'm *specifically* not talking about a hardware advantage, I'm taking about a software advantage, and you're talking about something that's completely unrelated."
EscapefromTarkov,fftzsy9,t1_fftz3gk,1580231341.0,"It's not a matter of debate, it's a matter of science and how human eyes work. It just so happens that our eyes are most sensitive to, you guessed it, green. So by increasing the greenery to a brighter color you're increasing contrast between that color and other colors that are neutral. Those reshaders don't make the camo clothing any brighter, do they?

So what you're suggesting is that BSG banned Reshader for absolutely no reason? Because it didn't provide an advantage? You're a joke."

EscapefromTarkov,ffdcjiy,t1_ffda9p7,1579817993.0,"It's known for the .45 caliber because that's where the insane fire rate and recoil mitigation system really shine. There are tons of SMGs throughout history that can pump a bunch of bullets out real fast like, but there's really only one that can pump out a shit load of very large bullets and actually be controllable.

That's like saying that the Desert Eagle is also available in calibers other than .50 AE. While that's accurate, that's not what makes the gun special.

In short, the guns are iconic because of their immense stopping power, and if the DE only shot .357 or the Vector only shot 9mm, almost nobody would have ever given a shit about them lol so it would make the most sense to put the vector in as a .45 SMG because that's the most known/iconic variant."
EscapefromTarkov,ffcyutj,t1_ffcjsh5,1579810097.0,Well the vector shoots .45 acp IRL so it would make the most sense to do .45 regardless of balance lol I believe they make semi-auto civilian versions with different lowers but almost every game that the vector is in has it shooting .45 because that's kinda what makes it a special weapon

I get that Nick's opinion is respected, but absolutely nobody ever mentioned that shit before his video (some even loved it because it meant they had something others couldn't have). I can't fuckin stand the online knife community and their complete and utter lack of any original thought. All places like Reddit and IG do is listen to reviewers and parrot whatever opinion they have as if they're more ""right"" or justified to hold that opinion because someone who makes videos on the subject backs them up.

I also don't like Sprint runs/limited editions, but the number of people acting like it's the worst thing to ever enter the knife industry and that companies should be damn near boycotted just because they put out a sprint is getting out of control.

Edit: specifically in this case, Giantmouse is a company run by two INCREDIBLY successful individual knife designers with more designs to create/manufacture than any of us can imagine. They don't want to constantly have to maintain a growing catalog of knife designs and all the quirks that go into continued production. So they make some knives, sell out, and move on."

knifeclub,feeug1x,t1_fee2jk5,1579041456.0,"I agree that banning/regulating knives is ridiculous, but absolutely nothing can cause the damage and have the durability of sharpened metal lol it's the same thing as saying you can kill people with rocks when talking about gun regulations in the US. Yes, you *can*, the difference is the effectiveness. Nothing is going to stab/cut as well or for as long as a knife, that's why we use knives for stabbing and cutting things.

Again, I don't support banning or regulating knives at all in the UK or US, but making comparisons where they aren't actually equal things just takes away from the argument. The thought process behind this legislation is that there is no object that is both as effective and easy to conceal as knives for stabbing people, period. So they're trying to curb stabbings by making those items less effective at one of those things. They're absolutely going about fixing the problem the entire wrong way, but what you're saying is the argument that's missing the point, not me. You're taking what is a very nuanced subject and making it seem very simple. ""Well I can stab stuff with anything so there's no point to even having a discussion about this!"". Ok, next time you need to open a package or prepare dinner, go grab a pen or a broken bottle and take care of it, it's just as good right?

You're making a very, very boiled down argument that isn't fair, and in my opinion takes away from the actual logical arguments against knife regulations by presenting a point that is extremely easy to prove wrong."
