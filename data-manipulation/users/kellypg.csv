flashlight,ffq2ls1,t1_ffisdcj,1580116958.0,I'm surprised that no flashlight company has put out a light with a decent little screen and 3 buttons on it. I'd really like to see a light with a geek vape aegis screen and buttons for the UI. It'd be so much simpler then remembering the 30 different clicky combinations to get a light to do something.
