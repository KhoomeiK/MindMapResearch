Taking care of yourself is many times more difficult when you don't have a place to live, to sleep securely at night, to store your belongings, to bathe, or to simply sit undisturbed.

You say above that helping the homeless isn't easy because ""most suffer from debilitating mental health and/or drug issues"" and that's a load of horseshit.  Giving people a place to live with no pre-conditions has [proven to be the most effective way to help the homeless.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_First#Evidence_and_outcomes)

And we have plenty of people with severe mental health and drug issues who are taking care of themselves well enough that they pay rent and go to work and do what they need to do to get by.  People function much better in that environment.  Sometimes they need a little help, especially when they are young.  Like I said, the foster care system is the biggest source of homelessness.  Another heavily over-represented group are LGBT youth who have been kicked out of conservative homes.  Living on the street is highly stressful and traumatic, and the longer you're stuck in it the more of an effect it has on you.

And when you see somebody high on crack walking down the street ranting you assume that person is homeless, you assume it's because of severe mental health problems that are just inherent and not a result of the shit they are in.  Don't assume that.

I was once a homeless drunk.  I became homeless as a teenager because of a dysfunctional home life and during the time I was homeless I developed a severe dependency on alcohol.  The day I got helped into a place to live was the day everything changed for me.  I was a drunk for years after that, and I still have mental health problems, but I've never been homeless again.

The longer they stay out there, the more likely they are to experience health issues including mental health and addiction.
