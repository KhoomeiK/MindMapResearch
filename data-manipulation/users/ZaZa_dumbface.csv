SuicideWatch,ffq153m,t3_et468e,1580114696.0,"Hey, I’m sorry you’re going through a rough time. It’s never too late to turn it around. But, it will take some willpower and effort. Reading some of your post history leads me to believe that you have goals and desires but you’ve lost confidence in yourself and are suffering mentally and physically.

I implore you to see a doctor, first. This can be your family/primary doctor and explain to him/her what you’re going through.

Second, you need to start exercising, anything. A gym membership can change lives. And I swear to god by that statement.

(You have to try to block out all the “noise.”)  fuck social media. Fuck your ego. Fuck your rejections and past failures. High school means nothing, trust me. I’m ten years removed from high school and I laugh about all the bullshit I worried and stressed about.

Now, we have to find a way to turn your grades around. C’s are fine. I’ll let you in on a secret, community colleges are amazing. You get a fresh start in a more adult/professional environment. And if you do well, you can transfer into a four year university.

But, I cannot stress this enough, it’s never too late to turn this around. And believe me, I know how hard it can be."
ankylosingspondylitis,ffp1x5o,t3_eubs51,1580084527.0,"I lie on the ground and practice deep, slow, long breathing, expanding the rib cage.

I use a foam roller, a broomstick (as a foam roller), two baseballs in a sock, and a basketball. There are many object one can use to get a deep relief and thoracic stretch.

I even do a standing back bend, where my back is on a desk or counter and feet are planted on the ground. I use deep breathing and the edge of the desk or counter for relief.

IM ALSO NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND IN NO WAY IS THIS INTENDING TO BE ADVICE TO ANYONE.

Our bodies are all different and this is what I do."

Foodforthought,ffhof7t,t1_fffenq8,1579945313.0,"Yeah, he’s full of shit, like most anonymous people on the internet and specifically Reddit. 

OP mentions in another comment that he has a masters degree. I guess he just paid cash for his education."
AcademicPsychology,ff5frbr,t1_ff5fayh,1579590927.0,Carry on. I hope everything works out for you.
AcademicPsychology,ff5eibn,t1_ff4ifq0,1579589457.0,"Oh, god. I’m sorry to hear that. If you live in the states that is just setting you up for mental torture followed up with a shity marketing/sales job or maybe a shift manager in a factory (with a shit load of debt.)

Psych is the ultimate filtering system. Very few go on to do anything related to the field or research or are able to stay in academia. One has to hit the math extremely hard, learn to program and become and respectable technical writer. But mostly be at the right university under the guidance of the right faculty."
Foodforthought,ff5ddep,t3_eqnrqd,1579588196.0,"Aristocracy isn’t sounding completely terrible at the moment. And, I’m only kidding to a small degree.

This will not get better anytime soon. The next 15-20 years in the US and “western” nations will continue to be divisive with a rise of neo-facism and radical right-wing nativist and nationalistic ideologies.

The best time for the average working class family in the US has passed, and isn’t coming back. And people will continue to take this really hard. Especially men.

It’s not all doom and gloom because we have such a high standard of living compared to 97% of the world. And will continue to have modest growth. The top 20-30% will be fine. I worry about the rest."
Foodforthought,ff5bisd,t1_ff527ya,1579586242.0,"Not even close, my friend. Global capitalism is here to stay. If the last global recession taught us anything, it’s that The G7 and G20 nations cooperating with economic monetary policy can “cure” all financial crises.

Capitalist realism is in full effect. There is no other viable alternative with how strong our international institutions and the structures of global capitalism are.

My guess is that if climate change gets too bad in the next 50-70 years, then that may possibly be the only obstacle for global capitalism.

People is the western world, on average, will have to accept a slightly lower standard of living. Basically less expendable money to consume junk. While those in emerging markets’ standard of living increases."
