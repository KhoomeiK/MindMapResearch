BlackPeopleTwitter,fe5oezp,t3_enpgw1,1578872141.0,"My family cough and sneeze EVERYWHERE - except my sister, but only because I give her death glares when she doesn't cover her mouth. My mum's are so loud and exaggerated, and she coughs all over the food and her clothes! My dad's sneezes are freaking insane. He'll put his hands on his knees and screech ""AHH-CHOOO."" and you can just see the millions of saliva split spew out onto the floor... btw guys, if you're gonna cough or sneeze at least do it on the back of the hand not the palm!"
depression,fe5nf3c,t3_enrs4c,1578871761.0,"I always think I'm making it up whenever I become sad about something. I feel I exaggerate my thoughts in the hope that some knight in shining armour will come to the rescue. Whenever I think ""being lonely and looking depressed all the time isn't attractive"" I can't help but also think ""you're only saying that to pity yourself and to validate the fact you think you're depressed"" I have no idea what I'm actually trying to mean and it's just so confusing trying to understand myself :/"
depression,fdf434d,t3_ekfp0m,1578352842.0,I'm at my most relaxed when I'm in bed. IRS so cozy and warm
depression,fcztfhd,t3_ejnao7,1578108306.0,"Every single time. I've had people call me annoying when I keep talking about things I hate, and I know hundreds of thousands of people find it annoying too when their friends keep talking about their problems. Even I'm one of them. My online friends also all seem happy, and I don't want to bring their moods down. I think I only feel comfortable ranting to complete strangers cuz I don't care as much as what they think about me."

tinnitus,fcw4uxe,t3_eixvu1,1578017191.0,"When I got headphones over a year ago I used it non stop. I loved being able to clearly hear the sounds/noises/music etc. Without any background noise, and just the privacy of it. This built up a lot of earwax and my right ear now has pretty noticable tinnitus. My left ear only becomes blocks and rings when I lay down, though so that's great"
tinnitus,fcw3zsh,t1_fcw2g0w,1578016622.0,Thank you! Have you heard of Neuromod Lenire? It's therapy for tinnitus and someone here's posted their experience on using it. When you have the time check it out!
tinnitus,fcw1ghc,t3_ej5rae,1578014946.0,"You are amazing. I'm so glad you listened to your gut instinct! In my case I'm pretty sure my ear wax is what's blocking my ear, and I dang right hope my doc will tell me the same when I visit her soon! Thank you again!"

depression,fcmwbts,t3_ehvibt,1577795232.0,"I really hoped that you're leaving for good reasons, but I don't think that's the case. I wish you stayed a little longer, gave yourself some more time. You can get better, you will reach your goal. I hope you haven't ended it all, I really do."
love,fclu48v,t1_fclrcy6,1577756507.0,"Haha no problem! Honestly you're doing great right now; you're realising how this has affected you, what you need to do to start recovering and are already making steps to becoming the guy you once were. There'll be ups and downs, but never forget that you're always inching closer and closer to being healed. Good luck!"
love,fclpelm,t3_ehmrgl,1577753250.0,That's so amazing!! Congratulations dude!!!
love,fclpaha,t3_ehr3xj,1577753168.0,"No matter how much you don't believe me, you will get through this. Time mends, time heals, so be patient and go easy on yourself. Plan a day out with some friends or just for yourself for something you've been wanting to do, or try out. Remember the other joys you got out in life, and your friends and family who'll be right there for you when you need a shoulder to cry on. I really do hope that you'll be able to recover, and become a stronger person. Hang on tight!"

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcknm83,t1_fckclr4,1577729224.0,Exactly!
depression,fciuw03,t3_eh9up7,1577670383.0,"I'm really glad that you haven't given up yet and that you're still fighting! Having to suffer and be miserable can lead to two things (your pick): where you want to be, and where you don't want to be. Do you want to suffer, only to kill yourself or do you want to suffer but end up at your goal (living happily?)

I don't know what you're going through right now but I know that you can get through it. You didn't think you'd get this far but look where you're at! You can do this. You are capable, you are worthy, and you deserve getting a chance to become happy."
Showerthoughts,fcat5iu,t1_fcaru38,1577576104.0,"Oooo! Thanks for the explosion of info! I always try to get high SPF's but normally the higher they are, the heavier and oiler it is on my skin but, with all the cool sunscreens everyone's suggested to me I'm sure that won't be a problem anymore :) thanks again for taking your time to write this for me!"
Showerthoughts,fcakopb,t1_fca4kh9,1577571097.0,Ooo I also have oily skin - will look into that too :)

HaircareScience,fc1ekmp,t3_efmmsn,1577316420.0,"""The scalp produces a natural, waxy oil called sebum from glands beneath the skin. Some people produce more of this oil than others. Sebum plays an important role in protecting your skin from infection and helping keep it moist. However, when the body produces too much sebum, it can build up on your scalp."" - Healthline website 
Hope this helps!"
depression,fc1cqkq,t3_efhdh9,1577314860.0,Your art is honestly so cute!! I love the vibrant colour scheme and the abstract ways you places the pictures - it fits like a jigsaw piece! Hope you had a good Christmas :)
HaircareScience,fbzygnw,t3_efe6wg,1577268591.0,"Same thing happened to me. I started just letting it air dry a few years ago and completely cut out hair dryers. Recently I've also been putting oil in my hair whilst it's still wet/damp, then braiding it into a low plait overnight.
Like another person said straightening your hair will only make it *a lot* more damaged so instead of straightening it, maybe plait it to make it look not so poofy - that's what I do :>"
