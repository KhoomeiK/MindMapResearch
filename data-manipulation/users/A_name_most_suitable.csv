Incarnates are a joke. I would love to see them toned down / or / increase the levels on content for lvl 50

So of you are 50+3 playing on +4 you fight lvl 54s

But it should be lvl 57s - might help address some of the problems



But some of the incarnates are a joke. Maybe best to limit where you can use them?

* Warshade: I swapped about a few times from human only to Tri form but my god was this toon a blast to play. The amount of keybinds and attention needed was insane ... Was like playing zerg 

Never loved the toons lore but the mechanics of a warshade are just nuts
