SuicideWatch,fft57mt,t1_fft4qk2,1580207744.0,"I wouldn’t want to hurt them. The only reason I want to see them one last time is because it feels like they genuinely do just love me for who I am, but they’re pretty young so I guess they just haven’t realized yet.Maybe there is another way but it doesn’t seem like one I could ever reach."
SuicideWatch,fft42qm,t1_fft3rzo,1580206008.0,"That means a lot but I just don’t think I can do it. I find no worth in myself, and I really don’t think I’ll be able to get better. Thank you for replying though :)"
smashbros,fft3vxb,t3_euvzv1,1580205716.0,“because he thought Rock Man sounded stupid” yeah cause Mega Man is such a good name
crashbandicoot,fft2knb,t1_ffrowso,1580203671.0,"Dude right!? I hate when that happens, plus it’s super hypocritical. Pokémon gets flying reviews every year but the new COD always get hated for its similar gameplay. 

I really do gotta try out these newer games though, thanks again for writing all this"
crashbandicoot,ffr9xk7,t1_ffok88y,1580153644.0,"Ok I’m kinda annoyed at Wrath of the Cortex’s reception then because I hate when people say it doesn’t do enough different. If you have something good, it’s not always super bad to just stick to it. I really love all of the 2D Mario games (even the New series!) and yet they get a lot of flak from the community for just being the same, but the levels are fun to run through and the new power ups were very fun so I can understand a little more now why people might say they don’t like even if it’s probably super good. 

Also is Crash Bash on the PS1? Now that you mention it I kinda remember playing a Crash party game with my friend when we were young, I remember the intro had Uka Uka and Aku Aku and Crash and Coco got some of the bad guys in their team cause it wasn’t balanced or something.

Finally thanks for typing all this out!"
crashbandicoot,ffnji0e,t1_fflsbuy,1580066768.0,I gotta play some of them dude they do look pretty cool
crashbandicoot,ffkyucj,t3_eu2li4,1580031601.0,"Ok I’m kinda new ish to Crash Bandicoot, I only really know it through a couple YouTubers and I played and platinumed N. Same trilogy. I thought people hated Twinsanity and I’ve heard that every game after the first three (and first kart and remasters obviously) are bad, would you mind explaining why you like it and what goes on? I’m not spreading this mindset without having played it btw I just really don’t even know what the games about"

truezelda,ffaab6r,t1_ff8u6ia,1579730970.0,"I think Phantom Hourglass was amazing, and then Spirit Tracks just kinda smoothed put the rough edges. Not everyone liked the Temple of the Ocean King (personally I loved it it let you conquer that dungeon and really made you feel like you we’re getting better) but the Tower remedied that by letting you skip previous floors while still keeping that progression in the same dungeon theme. The over world exploration was a bit worse, but only a bit, as the tracks were super fun to move around but did kinda feel like there’s no more secrets cause there’s already tracks there so it’s all discovered."
truezelda,ff7ay0y,t1_ff63tbr,1579645040.0,Right dude it was so goooood
truezelda,ff7ax5b,t1_ff5ubsi,1579645017.0,"Well let’s start with this: It has undeniably the best Zelda. She’s always said to have so much power but never really uses it unless it’s some big thing at the start or finish, here she tags along with you for the whole adventure and she’s actually an interesting character. This also allows the relationship between them to blossom really naturally and I love how it’s handled. This leads to (spoilers) the best ending ever where all that’s really needed is them holding hands for you to just understand everything, it’s super sweet. Speaking of our protagonist, Link isn’t just some nobody in this one. Being an engineer is a noble and big job in New Hyrule and Link is providing a real service to the land. Speaking of New Hyrule, what a beautiful place! I’ll always remember the first time I went to the water area and thought it was so cool how the tracks went over the oceans, then you keep going and they go underwater and you can drive into the depths! I thought the items were really fun to use too. This is kinda just my thoughts all over the place so sorry if it was hard to read but I just really love Spirit Tracks.

P.S. The music is the best in the franchise here."
truezelda,ff5e0vg,t3_ermjcy,1579588909.0,"Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks, ST is the best game in the whole franchise imo and the graphics on Switch could look so so goooooood"

Voice acting is super phenomenal and the story of 1 is really good too, of course it’s also got wonderful gameplay and a depressingly deep setting too. I really love these games."

SuicideWatch,fcz83r0,t3_ejlodk,1578095579.0,"Hey pal. 

I know shit sucks hard. I think I’m kinda there too. You question your friends and family and ask why this shit even has to happen. Well, I thought one of my friends hated me and was done talking to me over some stupid little thing that didn’t involve him. It still hurts that he treated me that way in the moment, but he came up to me and talked like normal the other day. 

I guess I’m just trying to say that things aren’t always as they seem, and sometimes friends go through fights. I know it’s hard but you gotta judge your friend and see if they’re worth keeping through this rough patch. 

I believe in you and thanks for writing all that down."

BlackoutBattleRoyale,fcz5nz0,t3_ejkz27,1578094171.0,"Don’t think my opinion matters to your cause but no, I would not, simply because Black Ops has been a favorite game of mine for a while. 2 was really good and arguably better, I somehow rarely played 3, and I was super hyped for 4 and I really love it, but the main reason I play is because of the nostalgia. I wouldn’t really want to play a COD without Takeo and a reference at Woods somewhere in there."
