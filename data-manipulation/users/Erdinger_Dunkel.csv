AskReddit,ffkh4qc,t1_ffkfm4s,1580022675.0,I think you meant *where is*.
AskReddit,ffkgpgl,t1_ffkfkt9,1580022471.0,"Oh, that's ok. Wait, is your pet a dog? Because if it's a goldfish, our reaction still applies.

Edit: Why am I being downvoted? Sex between two consenting dogs is ok! But a dog and a Goldfish is not! Sickos!"
AskReddit,ffkgaix,t3_eu3i2s,1580022282.0,"My dog already understands me. His vocabulary is just very limited. 

Now if you're increasing his vocabulary to human levels for ten seconds that's different, but if it's just for ten seconds, he wouldn't retain it, so it doesn't matter what I'd say. 

So I'd probably say something like ""I'm horrible at party games and hypotheticals, sorry bud. Let's go to the park."""

elderscrollsonline,ffhjr5x,t1_ffhf2u5,1579938437.0,"I'll excuse frustration. I won't excuse taking it out on others like that. Ever. You'll always have good players and bad players in every race, class, and role. Just like you'll always see assholes like that guy even in games like ESO where the majority or players are good people who just want to get away from their jobs or school or whatever stress they have in the real world for just a while."
elderscrollsonline,ffhbfo7,t1_fffrvtc,1579928804.0,"Clearing a Dolmen with Back Dat Ass Up cranked to 10 is pretty hilarious, although I'd probably get sick of it if I turned on area chat every time."

elderscrollsonline,ff2f4ti,t1_ff2elrm,1579503526.0,There's a spot in Summerset where you can get on this tall cliff by the ocean and there's a griffon flying around in the background. I think that is absolutely incredible for doing a screenshot. I took about 20 lol! I'm trying to recall what shoreline it was on. If I think of it I'll post a reply here.
elderscrollsonline,feu7qrf,t1_fetrk4r,1579383917.0,That sucks. What timing.

Just pay attention to your prompts. But no, your progress in your skill line stays. I reset my points to remove everything from restoration staff and my restoration skill line is still 42, even though I have no skill points in it anymore."

elderscrollsonline,felrpen,t1_felkrz8,1579229290.0,"Thanks! I was able to Google that one. At least one person said it stands for Most Effective Tactic Available. Even if that's not official, it makes sense.

Edit: BTW, when I Googled it, the first answer was a Reddit post LOL!"

elderscrollsonline,felg58m,t3_epriwx,1579221388.0,"I'm Xbox so I can't help you out, I just wanted to comment that it would be cool to play with someone with a Scottish accent. I love that accent. If I could pick an accent to magically have, I'd pick Scottish. If I couldn't do that, then I'd pick German, but it would have to be Werner Herzog's voice. And if play as a necromancer. That vould be cool."
