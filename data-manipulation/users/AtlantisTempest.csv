They say with millennials, everything is on delay. So maybe the ""I need to focus on my career"" phase is stretching longer than previous generations.

I know a lot of couples that blew 40k+ on shit like IVF and it didn't take. Now they say they don't want kids anymore. So maybe a certain disillusionment/sour grapes?"

Also -- often that magic you are thinking about - it often doesn't come from sexy vibes that someone gives off, but the characterization, plot, dialog...

Often writers (especially male ones, but women offend this a lot too) think they can somehow create chemistry and personality by how gorgeous/handsome/chiseled/perfect/soft someone is, and they totally skimp on the depth. Often an Ace can suss out redeeming qualities and compatibility between characters without having to rely on the character ""face"" value.

An yes. For me, sex scenes are merely opportunities to convey characterization. I don't feel much for the sex that I write, in fact, I feel nothing if not gross out. But you won't catch my readers feeling the same way. They fucking re-read those chapters XD"

lgbt,ff0ppj8,t1_fezlog2,1579471122.0,"More than detail. We objectively improve craft.

 It's like grammar: non native speakers know the mechanics of grammar better than native speakers because they had to learn each rule individually (and in an academic environment).  Most native speakers just adapted it from their family/friends -- which is often littered with cultural quirks. Most native speakers are riddled with grammar mistakes, and they are so ingrained that they never notice them to fix it.

Ace artists are often constructing sexual contact/performance from scratch, thus they must learn foundational details from the ground up. That's why Anthony Bogaert (the famous Ace-centered sexologist) explained that the more technical understanding and taxonomy of ""orientation"" (romantic, sexual, gendering, fetish, etc...) came from the Ace community earlier than other communities: we need technical labels because we have a difficulty expressing what is unconscious to  our more sexual peers)"

I can't write ""inspirational"" because the non-sex romance is cornered by the christians. So I just suck it up and write them.

And honestly, I'm pretty damn good. I think because I can focus on the craft of a sex scene without getting aroused and blinded by fetishes.

Although when I walked out of the theater, I saw Joker as a superior Taxi Driver -- I always felt the depiction in Taxi Driver was a disconnected mental health observation -- the ending about him killing the pimp and somehow being hailed as a hero felt forced.

I think once again that's where an Ace's strength comes in. Often writers (especially male ones, but women offend this a lot too) think they can somehow create chemistry and personality by how gorgeous/handsome/chiseled/perfect/soft someone is, and they totally skimp on the depth. Often an Ace can suss out redeeming qualities and compatibility between characters without having to rely on the character ""face"" value.

An yes. For me, sex scenes are merely opportunities to convey characterization. I don't feel much for the sex that I write, in fact, I feel nothing if not gross out. But you won't catch my readers feeling the same way. They fucking re-read those chapters XD"

lgbt,ff0ppj8,t1_fezlog2,1579471122.0,"More than detail. We objectively improve craft.

 It's like grammar: non native speakers know the mechanics of grammar better than native speakers because they had to learn each rule individually (and in an academic environment).  Most native speakers just adapted it from their family/friends -- which is often littered with cultural quirks. Most native speakers are riddled with grammar mistakes, and they are so ingrained that they never notice them to fix it.

Ace artists are often constructing sexual contact/performance from scratch, thus they must learn foundational details from the ground up. That's why Anthony Bogaert (the famous Ace-centered sexologist) explained that the more technical understanding and taxonomy of ""orientation"" (romantic, sexual, gendering, fetish, etc...) came from the Ace community earlier than other communities: we need technical labels because we have a difficulty expressing what is unconscious to  our more sexual peers)"

I can't write ""inspirational"" because the non-sex romance is cornered by the christians. So I just suck it up and write them.

And honestly, I'm pretty damn good. I think because I can focus on the craft of a sex scene without getting aroused and blinded by fetishes.

Although when I walked out of the theater, I saw Joker as a superior Taxi Driver -- I always felt the depiction in Taxi Driver was a disconnected mental health observation -- the ending about him killing the pimp and somehow being hailed as a hero felt forced. Like the writers desperately wanted a happy ending.

 The Joker seemed like a more fitting end to a mental health spiral. The joker was not an organized leader, but a randomly chosen symbol as the face of a self-destructive moment of chaos."
