Despite the fact that he bigot is being disruptive. **The bigot is speaking out of turn!** He doesn’t have the floor but he’s acting out and disrupting the meeting. **The bigot by any reasonable measure should have been removed from the meeting but instead he’s afforded special treatment nobody else would have received**. Would the meeting moderator tolerate a minority-rights group disrupting the meeting? If a BLM activist was making repeated outbursts like this, would the cop even need to be asked by the moderator to remove them? 

Too many people think upholding free speech rights means celebrating - not merely tolerating - the worst kind of speech. This guy’s entitled to his opinion **but he still has to follow the rules**. He has not Constitutional right to disrupt the meeting and since he won’t follow the rules he’s no longer merely making speech, **he’s committing civil disobedience** and like left wing activists performing a “sit in” he should be treated as such: asked to leave, and arrested for trespassing if he refuses."

1) You can vote for the guy who thinks it’s okay to be and is married to a man and who is in favor of policies that would benefit you as a typical worker and who is a decent human being with the temperament for the job; or

2) You can vote for the guy who (at least claims to) share your contempt for gays and who serves only the rich at your expense and who is an overall dreadful human being that the whole world hates but at least he’s on your side on the gay thing
