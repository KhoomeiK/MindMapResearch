We do the work but the Americans take credit because we do it there or they fund it. You should see the shit they push when it comes to aviation..we made some amazing stuff but America blackmailed the UK to destroy it so we'd use their designs, and that goes for many things including Jets right down to rifle ammunition calibre. We had the better design but nope, US lobbies and goes with their worse design for NATO. We invented the tank, the jet engine, the fucking dreadnought and just by name alone that should make you proud.

Basically, we lost our superpower status because we gave all our money to the Americans in WW2 as they sit on the sidelines for years screaming ""not our war!"" while they milk those in the time of need...well, it wasn't ours either and technically we could have opted out but we did the right thing who then after the war used our engineers along with Germans and other Europeans to make stuff they claim is ""American"".

No it's not the same which was my point, but the main point to that was, it really doesn't matter. Take a look at the US and their debt. Japan is a fickle argument because it causes some issues but on the other hand the benefits outweigh the bad.

If their target audience is predominantly male, then they're going to target that audience and that's fine. It's a business. If women wanted an RGB powerhouse of a PC for gaming, then they would buy them more but an advert with men in it isn't going to stop them. It's like Mac who target their audience and usually have a women in it, but I'm not getting upset because she's using photoshop, something I do. 

It's outrage culture and it's being outraged at the most childish things. Nothing stops women from getting involved. Plenty of females play video games and all of the above but clearly they don't purchase from PC specialist so why lower their sell rate to appease 8 people who got upset by the advert who are probably the type that would never buy from them anyway. 

Should I write to Hollywood and try to get little women cancelled because it didn't have a fair and balanced diverse cast? No. There is nothing stopping women from making their own films, adverts, whatever, so stop trying to force diversity and instead, create your own and when it bombs take a look at why it bombed, instead of blaming ""men"". 

When I was growing up, I thought T2 was an amazing movie and Sarah Conner was a badass, same for Alien...why? Because it wasn't forced, but the new Terminator movie? Not interested because they _force_ it to be a ""badass"" female cast, and it's just cheesy. I am so sick of ""write a movie but care more about the checkbox of having a diverse cast than the plot"". People bitching at Game of Thrones because there wasn't enough black actors, well for a start it's a medieval time period, but _that's what the writer wrote_. Yet there's _nothing_ stopping a person of colour/gender writing _their own show_. Again, I don't go crying at BET channel for black people, but can you imagine the outrage if there was a white entertainment channel?

TLDR?

Sick of the forced diversity. Write what you want, cast what you want and stop trying to force others to write in demographics when they can do their own...and do, while excluding white people.
