Tiburon,ffzqnmv,t3_evvukt,1580390056.0,"I always got parts from Rock Auto with no issue. There’s two major Tib groups on Facebook called Tuscani Nation and Tiburon Racing League, and both can hook you up with a guy named Albert that ships OEM parts from Korea if you want to go true KDM parts, but that gets pricey. Standard parts on RA are pretty cheap. I did all the repairs on my car (which were pretty minimal considering the car’s age) and never really broke the bank."
