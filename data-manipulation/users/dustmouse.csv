ProgrammerHumor,ffr2lgg,t1_ffr2dwc,1580149089.0,It's the way it is being used for modern development that is much more involved than the original intent and scope that is the problem.
ProgrammerHumor,ffr0abi,t1_ffqxq2u,1580147631.0,"Thanks for the detailed response.  I feel like you can make similar pro/con arguments for any approach to JavaScript development.  So it comes down to tradeoffs.  I believe that is an inherent flaw in JavaScript.  It is being used in modern applications in ways that are beyond the scope of its original intent.  So much layering, abstraction, configuration to support making modern apps.

I partially disagree with your first point, because you can tighten or loosen explicit type enforcement in your TS configuration so you don't need to explicitly type everything.  You can also be lazy and use `any` and `unknown` types.  Obviously there is more overhead, and I personally object to using `any` type, but it's an option.

I have a hard time believing that any modern IDE has the same type safety/enforcement/resolution of TypeScript.  They are constantly updating the compiler to make typing flexible and powerful.  Support for generics is also a nice feature that I'm not sure there is an equivalent for in JS and a nice IDE.  Not to say that makes TypeScript superior, it really comes down to the needs of the project.  For large-scale enterprise applications, I think the strong type enforcement is a win.

I agree with your point on TS being a superset, not directly affiliated with the official standard.  But they are careful to follow the standard.  Also due to the need to support older standards, there is still a strong demand for transpilation with JS and essentially an abstraction of the runtime code from the specific standard you write it in.  But there is definitely a steeper learning curve in TS than just getting to know the latest JS standard.

I personally love writing in JavaScript as well as TypeScript.  It isn't that I champion one over the other.  And as JavaScript continues to evolve, it will weaken the case for TypeScript.  But it might never completely replace the need for TypeScript, because it has different goals."
ProgrammerHumor,ffqvq7c,t1_ffqvg9s,1580144726.0,"If you're doing modern JS then you're most likely using a transpiler anyway. Wht specific problems are you talking about?

In this case I noted aspects of TS specific to dealing with `this` so wasn't suggesting it solves all problems"
