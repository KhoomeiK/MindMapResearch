aww,fcn8r2f,t1_fcn8hke,1577806181.0,I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure the Welsh Government did it as incentive to promote travel throughout Wales. Possibly the SU helped pay into the scheme though. Thanks!
aww,fcn6bw0,t1_fcn5ib1,1577804424.0,Do you mean that the T1 free weekend buses are paid for by Aber SU?
aww,fcn0voc,t1_fcn0s2f,1577800013.0,What! Tell me more!
aww,fcn0oy6,t1_fcmyv28,1577799844.0,Yeah the T1C bus to Cardiff is 3h40 (no change) and the train is 5h25 (3 changes)! The price difference is ridiculous too. Free T1 on weekends and £65 for the train full price.
doodles,fcms55b,t1_fcm1lmp,1577789576.0,I thought it was Nick Cage for a sec haha
TheWayWeWere,fcmr34t,t1_fcmbw2n,1577788046.0,Really? I've never heard of this but it sort of makes sense in a sad way. Do you know how much they would get for a photo?
aww,fcmogs0,t1_fcmn7bv,1577784314.0,Chiming in here from the Aber - Birmingham line. It's worse than ever with more complaints than before.
aww,fcmo7vg,t1_fcmkdmv,1577783966.0,This is a Transport for Wales train. They really don't care about what happens onboard as long as the train is in motion lol I agree though she shouldn't be on the seat
aww,fcmo3zu,t1_fcmkl3t,1577783815.0,It's an Arriva train (or Transport for Wales now) which is thee worst company. Highly doubt anyone there gives a shit lol
AccidentalWesAnderson,fc8hde0,t3_efus23,1577534939.0,"I am not joking. This guy went to my university - Aberystwyth University and was staying in my halls Caerleon Halls at the same time as me. I was wondering why he was so familiar! 

If he sees this post, we loved your style!!"
EarthPorn,fc661gh,t1_fc5h685,1577473084.0,Veldig fint bilde. Jeg er bare i Gausdal nå :) godt nytt år
Anxiety,fbg61vr,t3_ed5mms,1576836280.0,"I just left my job of four months because I had suspicions two girls were talking behind my back and my anxiety was so bad going to work.

Tbf, I know they were actually talking about me because one girl (C) told me that ""oh yeah F said she has that problem with you too and that you never do this job properly"". Neither of them are managers. It's a super small company (~15 people max) so I left horrible leaving."
