But I was hanging on every word of his closing last night, and felt like it was one of THE most effective, compelling, and straightforward speeches I’ve **EVER** heard from either chamber of Congress, certainly in my (adult) lifetime (I’m 50).

It was a damn fine closing, and it spoke to its audience (the Senate) with the sort of clarity you almost never hear these days. Didn’t speak down to anyone. It wasn’t soaring rhetoric, but I think it was all the more powerful for not attempting to be the least bit “soaring”.

Pandora,fffw2cz,t1_ffebjvu,1579893057.0,"Yeah, it took me a while to figure out what features were available with/without hearing/seeing ads associated with the feature.

I just bought Plus too, and wanted to hear ""artist only"" for a particular station, but it made me watch a video ad, and then only played 4-5 songs by that one artist, and then went back to the regular channel.

Didn't realize that ""artist only"" was a Premium feature (not available via Plus), and I'm sure on-demand listening is the same sort of thing.

Not entirely clear when you sign up for Plus, but basically Plus only lets you play regular Pandora stations (in regular mode, ""Deep Cuts"" or ""Discovery"", or maybe there's another mode I'm forgetting), and it will do all that WITHOUT any ads.

But much more than that, and you have to watch an ad, and even then, you only get the Premium feature for a little while, before you revert back to Plus (usually in less than half an hour)."

> I have a two and a half year-old niece who is obsessed with Dora the Explorer. Actually, obsessed isn’t nearly strong enough of a word. I’m convinced nothing short of a rigorous regimen of methadone treatments could wean her off of the Dora narcotic.

The Newshour with Jim Lehrer.

Their first 2 albums are fantastic, and I highly recommend their early 2000’s cd of studio remakes of all earlier material - which totally kicks ass almost as good as the originals — it’s called **Return The Gift**.
