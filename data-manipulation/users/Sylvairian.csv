Luckily Snoot is very much living his best life. Depending on the climate where you live, I’d recommend a snuggle safe heat pad. Single degus can get quite cold without a snuggle partner and you don’t want them shivering :("

Degus,fcx3eip,t3_ejduuk,1578049488.0,"I’m so sorry, I know how hard it can be. I had a degu die just before Christmas and his brother is completely fine on his own, I dare say even better. He’s learning tricks and lets me preen him which is a nice bonding moment.
But it seems to be a degu by degu case. I’d give the other degu loads of attention and see how they do for a few weeks.
If there is a huge change in behaviour or happiness then start looking for solutions.
But for now, let yourself grieve, give the other degu time to adjust and make plans in a little bit.
I’m so sorry again.
I buried my Watson in a flower pot I keep beside my bed (I call it Potson), so he’s always with me. I found it really helped with the grieving process.
Hope some of this helped :)"

When I was growing up there were no black people in my school or where I lived (town in Ireland) so I was literally an ignorant little white boy.
I truly regret not watching this show as a kid. I feel like I would have had a better understanding of racial issues that weren’t just Catholic/Protestant (typical in Ireland). From the few clips I’ve seen online, Will angry about his father, Carlton getting pulled over by cops and now this one, the writing seems so real and poignant but with humour to remind us that there are good parts in life.
Must watch this show from the beginning."

Degus,fc3twqr,t3_efzvwn,1577398526.0,"Mine heard thunder ONCE a few years ago and since then he’s balded one arm and has started on the other paw.
He nibbles it off. He does it after I preen him (his cage mate died recently) and also when he’s bored/stressed.
The only time he has full fur is when he gets out for several hours a day which I can’t manage at the moment.
It’s obsessive grooming, a trait he shares with me lol. As long as there are no open wounds he should be okay. But it could mean he’s stressed/bored. Try changing up the position of everything in the cage after the next clean. You’ll notice he’ll be super inquisitive and sniff around. Helps to do that every once in a while :)
