AskReddit,ffbot2s,t3_esi1iu,1579776212.0,I worked in a small lotion and perfume shop with just a few stores. The business was sold to some people from the suburbs and I was told they wanted to sue the original owners because there was huge discrepancies in the reported stock and what was really there. It was a laid back store before and they started making us read Nordstrom’s handbooks and pushing an aggressive sales strategy with bonuses for more sales. These stores were in the Bay Area and our liberal clientele did not respond well. I was fired long before they finally got closed down but it was obvious what was coming.

Parenting,fci6dhz,t3_eh6pga,1577658280.0,About to have my first and I can’t imagine going through a pregnancy with a baby or toddler. I feel for parents with more than one.

bipolar2,fc6ls9w,t3_egbpmd,1577483590.0,Weed is great! But it can also push you into psychosis if you aren’t careful. Another thing weed does is make it easy to ignore issues and let them build up. Also it makes you crave food that encourages our illness (sugar and empty carbs). But I still think it’s a great tool to give you relief when you need it. Edibles are awesome because it’s very easy to track and regulate your dosage and it actually attacks cancer when you ingest it as opposed to smoking it which puts a ton of tar in your body. Good luck!
AmItheAsshole,fc5yabn,t3_eg8hdn,1577468389.0,Everyone’s revenge fantasies are cool but I think leaving those people in your past would be the best thing for you. NTA though do whatever you want
bipolar,fc5xf9c,t3_egcilu,1577467914.0,This is so hard for me. I have to keep strong friendships and support outside of him. Coming here helps too. Focusing on a project or just giving myself the love I want from him is good too.
