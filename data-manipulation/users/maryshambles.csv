notliketheothergirls,fcm0oo5,t1_fck1dwp,1577761179.0,It does totally play into the incel obsession with height in a weird way. No one (very few) actually cares about how tall someone is .. and yet there are people out there who think it’s the sole reason they haven’t found a partner

fatlogic,fc6q16t,t1_fc4dwsj,1577486587.0,"Sorry for the late reply, but thank you for saying that! Puts my mind at ease a bit. I think I find this movement particularly unsettling as a person in recovery from drugs and alcohol. If a group of people told me “you’re not an addict, you don’t need to change, society and addict-phobia is the real problem” I likely would’ve ran with it. I just find this mindset so incredibly damaging."
