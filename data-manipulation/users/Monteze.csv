martialarts,ffip3mp,t3_ettyah,1579979206.0,"Obviously running away is the number one but to get to the spirit of the question let's assume you *have* to defend yourself.

Weapon disarms are kind of silly in my opinion, most don't work unless the person is in a very specific position and the margin of error is huge. Most people forget everything they have not used a lot once the adrenaline gets going. It's super niche like HEMA and even if you practice it a lot not having a weapon is a huge obstacle to overcome.


Now what defines ""useful""? Your ability to stop someone from hurting you? Well you could go into the finer points of boxing, wrestling, BJJ, judo, Muay Thai etc. All the arts that pressure test and you'll probably end up with something similar to MMA. You'll need to focus on what you're actually going to train and be able to do by sheer muscle memory. Because of all the fighting footage we have you generally see guys get KOd by a good punch, slam or both guys go to the ground and GnP ends it. Does matter how many things you know if you can't do theme under pressure."

Well he said he would do it himself, fuck that he wasn't a mechanic and then he said he would save for it. He didn't/couldn't keep even a basic job and ended up slowly, like over a year giving me ~500 bucks before he just bitched about how it wasn't even a big deal.  He couldn't afford it blah blah blah.

He has had to use his BJJ on the street a few times. As he puts it it gives you options and let's you think with your more rational brain versus being terrified and shoot too early.

He says you need something between shoot to kill/breaking someone's face with a baton and verbal de-escalation. He has had people try to run, hit him while he takes them down and refuse to be cuffed. If he didn't know how to pin them and calm them down then he is stuck between too little and too much.

All of those things were micguffins. He got his ass kicked and then just brutes his way through it. 

Now don't get me wrong, that alone doesn't mean the story is trash or I condemn you for enjoying it. But I just don't get the story of ""hard work"" when he was virtually destined to be powerful. Same with Gara, dude literally can stand there and his sand demon does all the work. Again, Rock Lee worked his ass off and didn't even have the chance to use chakra. The gates he opens isn't even special to him, he has to use it to stand a chance. 

To keep with my analogy, if someone was born into a huge fortune they can throw money at an issue and work hard to an extent but it's way easier than someone who was born with nothing working hard 

If naruto or gara worked like Rock they would be even stronger.

And that's not even mentioning the lame linear power scaling!  

""Oh no! He is so strong!  Wait ..not *this* guy is SO STRONG! DBZ falls into this crap but at least earlier arcs didn't have as much shonan to fall back on like Naruto did./rant

Like a trust fund baby throwing money at a problem, except the money is a god/mcguffin living in his ass.

Please fanbase who is about to downvote me, tell me how this is wrong. Because that is all I see in the show. Yea Gon in HxH has a gift but he still has to earn power and the scaling isn't linear and boring and he still loses to better fighters, and has *one* asspull at a huge cost.

I personally enjoy firearms but my reason for not carrying is because it's a huge burden. If you're in a conflict having a gun adds an extra thing to worry about. People get weird about guns and they also get in the way haha"
AskReddit,feto1um,t1_fetn28q,1579377447.0,Yea that's just a rifle. An assault rife is a fully automatic which are insanely rare.
AskReddit,fetnvlw,t1_fetaeew,1579377375.0,"Yep. Males are required to sign up for the draft, we can buy 2ton death machines and get that sweet ass debt to go along with it, buy long rifles and be held accountable by the law as an adult. BUT!! Don't you dare drink! Reee!

And to think some still have to ask for permission to use the bathroom in highschool."
AskReddit,fethd6e,t1_fetfkhc,1579375489.0,"I love you! I just hate who you are and you're lifestyle! Tehe! I can still pretend to not be an asshole now. That's how they sound when they say that. 

Just because a lot of people are cool being shitheads doesn't mean it's ethically okay."
AskReddit,fesj1c9,t1_ferdbz5,1579365721.0,"I wish I was that lucky. I live in the Bible belt though so I can't not hear about it pretty regularly, I am an atheist and most don't know it so they assume you're Christian and say some ... colorful things. 

Not sure which bugs me more, the blatant ""x people are bad because God says so."" Or the insidious Hate the sin not the sinner and we  ""love"" everyone equally. 

I don't go to many concerts but I hear these things in passing."
AskReddit,fervju0,t1_ferpmdf,1579358784.0,I am impressed people can draw that quickly honestly.
movies,fepc4yd,t1_feow4dh,1579316910.0,Yea older guys have wider faces and heads.
bjj,feozav9,t1_feoygqm,1579308646.0,"We, as in BJJ guys or those who do more combative martial arts tend to shit on tkd and karate for their point fighting and how silly it looks (the infamous video of two guys just hopping in from of each other for the round) along with katas. It generally bemoans how the art went from being more martial to a more toned down tacky art. 

Well with guard pulling looking like the video we see in this post we kind of are collectively caught with egg on our face. For doing something similar. Yea we do have MMA to fall back on as defense but how many of us actually do that. 

More or less I am just trying to make a self aware joke."
atheism,feoibat,t1_feog4og,1579300529.0,Probably but eventually something has to give and it will jar a lot of folks.
AskReddit,feo9hu0,t3_eq1wzh,1579296944.0,"Either a few thousand in cash or my knees to feel better. Ugh, the meniscus is a little bitch."
MMA,feo9eso,t1_feo9ap9,1579296892.0,"Yea, it was part of the joke. I figure most guys juiced back then and some are now."
martialarts,feo9cb4,t3_eq6sce,1579296849.0,"I think for a few reasons,  in the US a lot of UFC talent is coming from wrestlers who need a career path and boxing is pretty popular in there too. BJJ is too, but wrestling and BJJ is too ground focused if you want balance in MMA. 

BJJ and Muay Thai work well because the upright stance in MT makes you more Susceptible to takedowns but if you're really good at BJJ you can defend, submit, sweep or get back up. And throwing head kicks kind of encourages them to want to clinch with you. 

You see some over lap with the Diaz Bros being BJJ black belts and box primarily with success. 

I also think it's part of the evolution of the sport, do you want to try something new and risk your career path on experimenting or go for the paths laid out and hone those? A fighter has about 10 years if they are lucky to make enough money/connections to retire on."
