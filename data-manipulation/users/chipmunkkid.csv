college,fesgwe4,t1_fesgbqf,1579364985.0,"It may be cheaper than a real textbook, but tbh I’ve been able to sneak thru classes before frequently without buying the text. TopHat makes it a necessity :/ but I totally see what you’re saying"

college,fdhbz7a,t3_elbs06,1578419664.0,"I would do more research and definitely contact alumni. I’d recommend LinkedIn.
