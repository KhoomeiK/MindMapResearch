Switzerland,ffiyhz5,t1_ffirl4n,1579985844.0,"Such an idea only comes from someone who can't imagine himself in others situation. 

They have to take care of their stuff because parents can't be bothered to get school supplies everyday. So do you think it's wise to lend something to that kid that constantly loses his stuff? 

I mean they were supportive in the beginning, only normal to be annoyed afterwards."
AskReddit,ffixxwa,t1_ffilz83,1579985442.0,What a genius you are to use such a daily occuring situation to refute my opinion. Most people would've used extreme situations to cross someone's opinion. But not you

AskReddit,ffi6lpd,t1_ffi0gxk,1579966457.0,"Disagree. In a society where we depend on one another to have a functioning system, you must be stupid to do things selflessly. 

However if you see that someone is in need of something you have and you are willing to offer such thing in exchange of another thing they can give you willingly, that is being good. 

You don't make relationships by selflessly giving handouts but by creating an emotional connection to people you trade with."
todayilearned,ffi21xx,t1_ffi1mng,1579962769.0,"Turned out that i don't really sympathize with nazi... So it must be narcissism. You wanna jump from one point to the other in behalf of accusations, ALL that just so you can excuse your oblivious, naive tendency of agreeing with everything bad someone has to say about your enemies. 

This is truly typical American behavior. If someone doesn't agree with you, make him public enemy #1. Because you guys never lied about history before."
