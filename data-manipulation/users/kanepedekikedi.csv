relationships,ff5ke04,t3_erisrs,1579597076.0,"Hello, i'm thinking my comment might help because i was in your daughter's place 3 years ago, at the same age with her. Whatever you do you can't stop a teenager girl from dating her boyfriend. Best chance is that she will say okay but will keep seeing him in secret. My mom tried that and i was a very, very nice kid. Like nicest in my extended family. But when she tried that, everyone saw my not-so-nice face and it caused a big fight between my mom and i.(In my situation, she had no right to do that because she just didn't want me to have a boyfriend because of religion stuff and that was all so i stood up to her.) 

Who she will love is beyond your control. She likes him. She can't just stop liking him. And at the age of 16, most people have no idea how bad relationships start, how they develop and what will they cost them in the end. She doesn't realize what she is in because she is focused on how much she likes him.

Now, let's talk about what you have to do. Everything you do to push her away is actually pushing her to him. Just go and talk to her. Don't tell her to ""leave him"" , tell her about all your concerns, that she is in control but she has to make the decisions that won't harm her. Make her see the big picture for just one second. I'm sure she'll listen."

Like when i went to his shop, i saw the chest on upstairs but it required a key so i took his key after killing him.

I treat my *adopted* cat like my own daughter. What else was i going to do? Pets are our children.

relationships,fd8shn7,t3_ek1kth,1578222808.0,"I mean it is never late if you both want to save your relationship but from what you told, it didn't sound like you were really ""soul crashing"" as you think you were, but your husband definitely was. So he admitted that he is flirting with other women because you aren't good to him? This is no reason to cheat, this is a reason to break up/ divorce so he probably wants to end this relationship but doesn't have the guts. I mean, i'm just assuming. I can't know better. Cheating isn't about the partners. Go ask him. Give him a break after this fight then if you will do anything about it, know what you want and what he wants first."

AmItheAsshole,fd0t4wp,t3_ejkij2,1578123404.0,"This is a situation where there is a thin line between good and bad intentions.

The problem is, they never tried to call you. Legally they can't do anything without asking you. If they tried to call you and you didn't pick up, then they decided to put themselves in danger for the dog's sake, they would be heroes because god knows how many times they had to watch animals suffer because of irresponsible owners.

But they didn't even try to call you. And they are still trying to charge you. This is why i don't believe in their good intentions. Would someone who will stand against the law for the sake of an animal do it for the money? What i'm saying is, there are lots of shitty people who does stuff like this regularly to rob their customers and in this situation, their intentions are really questionable.
