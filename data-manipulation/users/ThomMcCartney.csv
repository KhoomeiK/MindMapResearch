TrollXChromosomes,ffzzuz7,t1_ffzz430,1580397042.0,Holy shit that statement confirms all of my beliefs about libertarians in one go.
science,ffyqis3,t1_ffymvis,1580352683.0,"Gender is preferred. Gender confirming activities include surgery and clothes, but it also includes things like voice training and taking hormones or the hormone blockers that started off this whole conversation. Trans people may ask, some, or none of these things for all sorts of reasons including cost or it not being safe to appear trans."
science,ffyljvv,t1_ffyjv69,1580349305.0,"It's kind of both and kind of neither. Like, think about how women 150 years ago couldn't wear pants in regular circumstances but 
nowadays in most places nobody gives it a single thought. Clearly that's cultural. 

But (and this doesn't necessarily concern trans people but I do feel it's relevant) in the mid 20th century there was a practice where people who were born with ambiguous genitalia or had botched circumcisions were assigned a gender by the doctor and their parents were told to raise them as the assigned gender. In a lot of people where their assigned gender and chromosomal gender didn't line up, there were mental health problems. I don't have exact figures, but it was greater than the general population."
science,ffyj1dw,t1_ffyiler,1580347594.0,The difference is gender dysphoria is alleviated by doing things which are gender confirming.
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ffyhwmf,t1_ffyg9pp,1580346822.0,"I think you made a good point, I just think people weren't receiving it well. 

I actually was referring to people who do the whole ""yas kween slay"" but I've only seen it from other cis women who treat trans women like they're just a deluxe version of a gay man (you know, like how in the 90s gay men were treated like like a purse dog). I guess it goes to show how people's different experiences color their perceptions.


Fetishization sucks super hard and is scary."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ffyejku,t1_ffy2q3w,1580344532.0,"I think I understand what you're saying, but I disagree that people who don't support transmasc are necessarily fetishizing transfemme (I do assume they don't think enbies exist) and vice versa. I think a lot of it is people who still think of trans women as full time drag queens and trans men as uwu soft bois.  I feel that this is an important distinction because yes it is transphobic but it's important to know where people are coming from if they can learn better."

MBMBAM,ffybdet,t1_ffy910s,1580342400.0,"Check out the TAZ sub, they act much more like members of any other fandom- i. e. genuine criticism where it's due but also people getting kinda nasty about the product not being 100% perfect all the time.


BTW I think the bit is hilarious but it does make me think that Justin doesn't care about the show and maybe just wants to move on with his life"

MensLib,fehd7nm,t3_ep35pu,1579114142.0,"I guess the question is are you talking about strangers on the street or people who already know you or potential partners? 

As for painting your nails clear, I can't imagine that anybody would notice that your nails are shinier except maybe for someone who is actively examining your nails, but maybe I spend less time looking at people's hands than the average person does.

As for shaving your legs, unless you're really hairy in general, people who don't know you will just think your legs aren't hairy if they even notice. Family and friends might notice if you're wearing shorts. Anybody is going to notice that you shave as soon as they feel your leg but at that point, it's highly unlikely to be a deal breaker."

Females tend to present differently when we have heart attacks, including symptoms and how it looks in scans but of course the research is largely based on how males present so male symptoms are ""classic"" and female symptoms are ""atypical"".
