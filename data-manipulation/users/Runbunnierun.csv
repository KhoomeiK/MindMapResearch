StardewValley,ff3x07c,t1_ff3lb9z,1579550693.0,That sounds pleasant. I was so focused on friendships in my first year it took 3 to finish the community center.

Teachers,ff091ff,t1_fezf0kh,1579466501.0,In a class of 20 only 5 would get less than an A.  No one would make below a B. I think that's a pretty nice deal.
Teachers,ff08vhk,t1_fezjgmh,1579466439.0,It was an idea I borrowed from our highschool. The only real limit I saw at first was that no one made below a B. Considering my classes tend to average in the low C's I thought this would be an easy boost to their grades this semester. We will have a lot of other test this 9 weeks. I didn't think vocabulary really needed to be one of them.
