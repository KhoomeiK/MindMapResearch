worldnews,fefysg0,t1_fefu37c,1579069828.0,"Pliable politicians, loose regulations, cheaper logistics, the reasons can be myriad. California and Arizona are both places that lack water. Yet Nestle (Swiss) has been egregiously exceeding their pumping limits for decades in California without any severe penalty. Saudi Arabia went into Arizona and set up huge farms in areas with little or no pumping restrictions so they could tap into aquifer water to grow hay needed for their livestock industry. Both CocaCola and Pepsi operate in southern India and have been accused of worsening the drought situation there and siphoning off water vital for farming. Doesn't matter where it is, if bottling water was economically feasible and politically safe in places like the Sahara, the Amazon, or on Antarctica, you can bet someone will do it."

We started the whole Iraq War 2.0 based on ""thin evidence of a threat"" and killed a country's leader who, despite being an asshole despot, at least imposed a sort of brutal peace within his country and provided a secure buffer between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Now we got ISIS, a collapsed Syria, a resurgent Turkey and Iran all vying for a piece of this shitty pie. And all this just so we could stroke our own bruised ego, further our resource demands, and with ""an eye towards domestic politics""."

This one in Los Feliz is still his though, and if you look it up in Google street view, it's been in the same dilapidated condition since 2007. That leads me to believe he's just a terrible homeowner."
