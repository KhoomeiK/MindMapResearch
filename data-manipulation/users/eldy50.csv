You lack basic logic skills if you think that a fallible justice system makes capital punishment immoral but not imprisonment. A person can be erroneously sentenced to life in prison *just as easily* as they can be sentenced to death. Actually it's easier because of the automatic appeals in the case of capital punishment. And just because *it's possible* that an innocent man in prison can be freed does NOT mean that it's guaranteed. Someone on death row can be freed too. What's the moral difference?"

That way when they complain I'll be able to explain that words like 'lame' and 'gay' have a colloquial meaning which is entirely distinct from the bigoted origins of the terms. And since communication is a two-way street, meaning does not exist solely in the mind of either the speaker or the listener. Before one self-righteously accuses someone else of being bigoted, he or she has an obligation to make a good-faith attempt to infer speaker intent from context. Offense isn't a trump card in inferring meaning, and listeners do not get to determine what someone else's words mean simply because they're upset. You can change your emotional reactions just as easily as I can change my vocabulary."

Uh, yes. Sounds like someone's been carrying a grudge around for a disturbingly long time...

>I've always said Reagan wasn't to blame for the ~1981 recession/depression or GW Bush for the mild recession of 2001, but why did the economy grow slower during his 1st term, when he mostly cut taxes, than during his 2nd term, when he raised taxes every year? And when Clinton became President, it looked like the deficit would keep rising, but with a lot of urging from Al Gore, Clinton decided to tackle the deficit by almost freezing spending, and most Republicans predicted his tax hike would doom the economy when it probably did the opposite.

You can weave any story around the economy that you want to (e.g. Clinton's tax hike boosted the economy vs. Clinton was rescued by the information revolution ... also it was the Newt Gingrich-led Congress that was responsible for reigning in spending). This is why you see very few macroeconomists who make predictions.  Within very broad limits, macro is just randomness."
AskReddit,fefk4hs,t1_fefiniv,1579058019.0,"LOL. Economic outcomes lag policy changes by several years, so looking at economic performance during an administration is nonsensical.

I mean, the economy in the 90's exploded because of the information revolution - do you seriously think Clinton is responsible for that?

Shut down bad social policy, particularly the portion of the political spectrum which has turned victimhood into a profession. The achievement gap isn't due to some racist boogeyman, it's due to inherent IQ differences.
