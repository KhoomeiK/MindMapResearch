politics,fe5u0nw,t1_fe5tpfx,1578874916.0,"I feel like I agree with the stance you’re taking here. Ivanka is where she is because she’s Trump’s daughter, and we apparently have to act as though her role in government is legitimate. I can’t pull her from those meetings, but I can stop her from being counted among people who earned their way to where they are."
politics,fe5sv1d,t3_enrs6z,1578874198.0,That’s a lot of words to go through to say “daughter”.
politics,fe5slkp,t1_fe501pi,1578874035.0,Ivanka is not a cabinet member and I feel the need to point that out.
todayilearned,fe37g7p,t1_fe2i0lv,1578846673.0,He’s bad at emoting through dialogue. Watch him stumble through Shakespearean prose in *My Own Private Idaho* to see a particularly bad example of it. He’s a good action star because he puts in the work. But it’s not a coincidence that Neo and John Wick aren’t known for their wit.

television,fdkzfs3,t1_fdkyja1,1578514322.0,"The idea of each key having a specific purpose, and using them together in creative ways, is what elevates the story for me. The kids start to realize the power they have, and the possibilities are fun and interesting... then you learn the lady in the well is essentially a side-effect of those keys being used without thought of consequence, and she has way more experience using them. It’s a natural twist that moves the story from fantastical power fantasy to desperately out-thinking a Machiavellian villain."
television,fdkmnrf,t1_fdk83i9,1578506730.0,"I mean the books are goofy too. Kinsey literally takes representations of herself out of her own head and puts them in a jar. The ability to do that is a major plot point, in fact. You need a tone that accounts for all of it."
