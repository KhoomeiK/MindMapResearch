BMW,fewo3pz,t1_fevczfe,1579416660.0,"For me it has to do with the aesthetics of the car. It seems like the M3 has 2 extra doors squished in to make a sedan where as the M5 was always a sedan but with a beastly genome. Also I grew up around the e30 M3, a coupe and the ideal in my mind."

gardening,fdpz77n,t3_d0431o,1578646970.0,I soaked the seeds for about 12 hours then placed them in between 2 wet paper towels in order to speed up germination. Cover the paper towels with Saran wrap and wait for a week checking daily after 5-7 days making sure the towels remain damp. As soon as the seeds start to grow take them CAREFULLY off the towel & plant in soil just as you would normally with only a light dusting of soil to cover them. Then just give it light & keep it moist but not flooded & it'll grow like mad.
