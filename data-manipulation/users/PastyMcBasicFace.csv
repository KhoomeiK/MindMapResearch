news,fffmago,t1_fff99co,1579887020.0,"In short, no.  The incentive plans for branch teammates were shit. The difference between a top payout and no incentive at all was maybe $1500/quarter. The top execs created a very high pressure model where teammates resorted to deceitful practices just to keep their jobs. And these shady practices were actually encouraged by branch/market/region leaders in an effort to pad the numbers reported to shareholders."

The shift in sales culture was immediate when Stumpf took over. Either way, the financial penalties levied against both of them feel inadequate. I fully believe they knew their practices were predatory towards clients/employees and they just didn’t care because the shareholders were happy and profits were booming. Glad your wife and I both got out!"

The CEO of all people is not exempt. In fact, I worked for Wells Fargo during the time Stumpf was CEO and can say he was 100% the driving force behind the high pressure culture and sales policies. He should be held financially and legally liable for the clients and employees he systematically mistreated."

AskReddit,ff1oz9i,t1_ff1li2i,1579482962.0,"The recent sales of similar homes in that market (not necessarily just  the immediate neighborhood) drive the value of a home. The key being that comparable sales are similar in size/amenities, but also condition/quality.

As an example, lets say you buy a home in need of major renovations (bathrooms, kitchen, flooring, general maintenance) for $250k. You could reasonably do the necessary renovations for $25-$50k, depending on how much work you are doing yourself as well as the quality of the materials. Then that same property would go from the bottom end of the market to top of the market and sell for $300-$350k depending on the extent/quality of the renovations. That’s at least what you could potentially do in my market assuming you play your cards right.

To successfully flip you need to buy at the bottom of the market, and sell at the top. Your profit margin will depend on how well you can manage the costs of upgrading the property and how appealing the home is to buyers once your renovations are done."
