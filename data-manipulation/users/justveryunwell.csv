Now since everything else in this reply was you repeating yourself, and I've got better things to do than follow you in conversational circles, this is my last response. ‚úåÔ∏è"
Pets,ff3nydy,t1_ff3h5ol,1579545111.0,"I would argue that all brachycephalic breeds are created-for-profit unfortunate animals :p

Also- I don't have an issue with a fabricated backstory either, whatever you've gotta do to save an animal, I just can't see it being very helpful to give people the impression that such a gorgeous creature is self aware to the point of sadness and shyness. The quote they wrote on her behalf is just.... Pathetic. I feel like if we're going to anthropomorphize this dog we should at least do it in a positive light lol"
Pets,ff3mr6b,t1_ff3ifw6,1579544371.0,"1. It seems you consider under-socialized animals to be inherently reactive/disruptive, and lots of them certainly are, but in this case all we're talking about is a shy dog. A shy dog can still be an obedient dog that performs well despite however it may feel about the situation. There was nothing to say that Jubilee was ill-trained, just shy, one interpretation of which would be that she may not be the most eager to meet new people, that's not to say she wouldn't let strangers handle her if her trainer/owner commanded her to.

2. I find it interesting that on your first reply you said backyard breeders don't exist, yet here you're operating under the premise that they do. They definitely do exist. On that note, I agree that they shouldn't be considered professional breeders, however the word breeder still describes what they're doing.

3. Professional breeders can still fail to meet minimum requirements for the wellfare of the animals they're housing."
Pets,ff3dcwt,t1_ff38nja,1579538853.0,"Ok, yeah, the things they said on Jubilee's behalf are total bullshit. This dog has absolutely zero clue that she's different and is probably only shy bc of a lack of socializing early on, a common issue for dogs from breeders. That honestly turned my stomach a bit just reading it, smh. They're just making Jubilee seem pathetic which she isn't. ""I wish I was beautiful,"" fuck right off, wow."
Pets,ff0lbdm,t1_fexxswy,1579469924.0,My god this is the most beautiful comment I've ever seen on Reddit üò≠
unpopularopinion,fekwyuq,t1_feklmrf,1579209325.0,China calls itself communist but is clearly either totalitarian or a dictatorship. They can call themselves whatever they want but the evidence speaks for itself
unpopularopinion,fedu0nj,t1_fecq99z,1579019871.0,"That's basically what I'm saying, and if we let them claim the word feminist without pointing out that their ideals and actions aren't feminist at all then they'll ruin a good word"
unpopularopinion,fecq4zi,t1_fecmmkx,1578980567.0,"I'm trying to say that there are sane and good modern day feminists, in fact most of us are but we aren't the ones screaming about it in every argument as if it provides immunity. Feminists aren't the ones that scream about feminism as they try and steal other human rights and just generally behave like shitty humans. It helps to call them what they are, bigots and monsters."
unpopularopinion,febw3qm,t1_feb821l,1578963445.0,That's not really feminism and calling it that only fuels the assholes perpetuating this shitshow
unpopularopinion,febvt3o,t3_eo5bdk,1578963334.0,"I don't remember who taught me this, but my mantra has always been, ""I will not throw the first punch, but you bet your ass I'm throwing the last."""
unpopularopinion,febvm17,t3_eo6jtu,1578963236.0,"Realize this is about progress, about recognizing that for every white guy that gets an Oscar, at least 5 more POC are more deserving of one. Realize also that people's prejudices can influence their whole view of a person, no matter what they think. In other words, someone can find a black person isn't funny just because they're black, yet *think* that it's just because they're not funny. (Don't believe me? Research implicit bias.) These things aren't objective, so no one can say what the true reason is in that case, but if you look at all your favorite celebs and find that they're mostly white and/or mostly men, its worth asking yourself why.

We might be able to think this way once marginalized groups have enjoyed true equality for a very long time. Until then, we need to keep examining our own motives and elevating POC in their endeavors, they DO deserve it."

Pets,fdtjk9k,t1_fdpmx8s,1578717682.0,"Adoption facilities commonly have you promise not to declaw, but so many landlords are selfish pricks that don't care about animal wellbeing, I've known of at least a few who put that in the lease regardless of whether it was legal or not - most people don't know those laws or think to look them up, and predatory landlords have no qualms taking advantage of renter ignorance."
Pets,fdmi8au,t3_em2req,1578550833.0,"This reminds me so much of the situation I found myself in at around 12, and I just want to commend you for caring and doing all you can. Surrendering them is what I wish I could have done, if they can be saved then a shelter is better equipped to do that. And then they're already where they need to be to find a more suitable home ‚ù§Ô∏è"
dogs,fdlcbsm,t1_fdkfyoc,1578520984.0,Even vets have different ideas on when to do it though
Pets,fdibxao,t3_elf9i9,1578439456.0,"Humans really are the worst, wow."
Pets,fclid0s,t3_eht6po,1577748485.0,"I know abused animals tend to have a harder time getting used to people the more that person reminds then of their abuser. Some animals dislike an entire gender, it could be a haircut, a voice, really anything. When that's the case it can make it harder or sometimes impossible for the animal to warm up to the person. I've known people who wouldn't rent to men at all just because their dog would attack men outright and they weren't willing to re-home their baby for strangers.

I am NOT saying this is hopeless, just giving you something to consider. It could be worth talking to a well-reviewed professional, in the meantime keep researching and practicing with positive reinforcement!"
Pets,fckq81w,t3_ehnqda,1577730830.0,"When a cat, or really any animal (including humans) shows that kind of behavior, it's almost always from a past filled with food insecurity. People that hoard animals never take proper care of them, so I wouldn't be surprised if the previous owner didn't feed them regularly, or just dumped a bunch of food in one spot and had all the cats go at it.

That kind of trauma changes an animal's brain more rapidly than anything else; it will take time to unlearn the things that helped your cat survive until now. In some cases, the behaviors might never completely go away, but they should improve with time and a strict meal schedule :) thank you for rescuing an innocent baby!"
dogs,fc9l0fh,t1_fc94l4j,1577554234.0,"Hey, the self awareness and desire to change at the first step :) now ya know! If you get a groomer you've had before you knew to tip, make sure to throw them something extra if you can as a sort of apology"
dogs,fc9k3sf,t1_fc7j95s,1577553843.0,There are a myriad of reasons why someone wouldn't be able to groom their own dog so don't get judgemental. The bad guys in this discussion are the ones abusing animals they're paid to care for.
dogs,fc9jqbp,t1_fc8p8yt,1577553683.0,"Thank you for this. Even if no actual abuse is happening, normal, routine things can be scary, especially to a little baby that can't understand our explanations of what's happening and why it's alright."
Pets,fc3sveb,t1_fc2ib39,1577397768.0,"Probably some dumb spiel about ""you asked us for this and we bought it for you, now you have to take care of it! ...Oh but yeah, only our way, bc you're also just a kid and therefore can't possibly know better than us no matter how much research you've done.""

Honestly I can't stand parents that act like this."
Pets,fc3sr5z,t1_fc2illg,1577397681.0,OK OMG THIS IS BRILLIANT
Pets,fc3sq7r,t1_fc27100,1577397662.0,"It sounds like OP already has one, but the parents think they know how to take care of it better than someone that's actually done their research. Very arrogant of them..."
dogs,fbxv1ic,t1_fbxus0r,1577201257.0,Any time!
dogs,fbxtn9h,t3_ef2cmt,1577200201.0,"At one year old, that's still a puppy, and a puppy of a very hyper breed to begin with. Does the dog get plenty of exercise each day? Tiring them out could make them more receptive to training, since they'll be able to focus. Research breed-specific psychology, behavior, and training so you can get a feel for how to work with your specific little devil :) calling a professional isn't a bad idea at all, just remember not all information and not all professionals are as accurate/effective as others."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fbxsg0q,t3_ef1qtn,1577199262.0,"Is it just me or do schnauzers have *the* most human faces and expressions? Like, eerily so lol"
Pets,fbxpse0,t1_fbxoc9m,1577197052.0,"Oh for sure! You didn't sound mean imo, just wanted to tack that on for anyone reading who didn't know üòá Theo sounds like an angy lil sweetie cx"
Pets,fbxp4i1,t1_fbxbpbs,1577196462.0,"Yeah cats are solitary but when forced to be alone all day they can get depressed or resentful. They can actually somewhat survive like that though, whereas a dog completely couldn't. It's a sad life for any mammal imo though, maybe a fish tank or reptile setup would be more ideal for your lifestyle, bearded dragons for example prefer to live alone with lots of space and light/heat, can be handled pretty often, and get all fat and lazy as they grow up :) just make sure to do your research and prepare thoroughly before you get another animal. It might be prudent to find a good home for your current cat and just take the freedom that creates to look into your next companion, keeping all aspects of your home life in mind."
Pets,fbxor4l,t1_fbxmak4,1577196127.0,"If this apprehension was present when OP got the cat then I agree wholeheartedly, I like to joke that all cats are empaths. It kind of sounds like OP was initially pretty optimistic and enthusiastic about having the kitty though, so if it's not the case then giving the cat up might only make things worse for him :("
Pets,fbxokxq,t1_fbxlkk5,1577195968.0,"With all that disinterest it kind of does sound like depression, and if you've committed to different kinds of training, kept with them every day for months only to see zero improvement, I would say your best bet is that feliway stuff I saw others talk about. I've also found it worth just studying general cat psychology & behavior, bc the more you know and learn the more capable you are of finding your own solutions within your own specific circumstances :)"
Pets,fbxobpm,t1_fbxiz3n,1577195725.0,"This! To go even farther, does the cat have a single room/area in the home that is his alone, doesn't change, you don't go in (unless there's something to clean up etc)? Giving my cat her own room helped her feel a lot more secure which made her a little more affectionate and a lot less aggressive."
Pets,fbxny90,t1_fbxl9w9,1577195372.0,"Idk what to make of walking away from pets and treats, but I do know that most of the time, a cat turning their back on you or closing their eyes at you (the Slow Blink) is a sign of trust and love :) cats are private by nature, some just don't want to show much affection"
Pets,fbxlplc,t1_f9rwlbu,1577193082.0,"Listen, my mom thought like you. Didn't take my cat to the vet for 8 YEARS after getting her, not a single visit. She was getting fixed, and the doc found her uterus, which should be about the size of your pinky, was the size of a soda can, so infected and engorged that it literally could have ruptured at any minute. She must have been in agony, but we didn't think she was showing it because we didn't know how to look. Cats are not any healthier than any other animal, they're just extremely good at hiding their injuries and ailments. They don't want you to know because they're solitary animals, and in the wild, injury means an easier target. Please take cats to regular be visits!"
Pets,fbxl7w9,t1_fb66bgw,1577192535.0,"I'm so sorry you experienced that, thank you so much for doing better. I saw some pretty twisted animal cruelty as a kid too, the US laws regarding it are disgustingly lenient. US law basically sees animals as objects, commodities whose value comes only from breeding and show proficiency. I hope that changes drastically in our lifetimes üíï"
Pets,fbxkq6z,t3_ebjmpm,1577191971.0,"Don't tell your neighbor. The mom clearly only sees the cat as property or some kind of toy to he discarded, so any action taken on her end would just be possessive, and the kids would only be opened up to he hurt even more by their mom as she sounds like the type to get them worked up and say it's your fault in a crap bid to guilt you into giving the cat back.
You did the right thing. That wasn't their cat, they abandoned it with no ID, refused to let it into their home when it could have died several times over. That's not how you treat your pets. Thank you for saving the baby ‚ù§Ô∏è"
AnimalsBeingDerps,fb6mwsy,t1_fb5t09g,1576554245.0,"Isn't mimicry a pretty common trait among social animals, like the whole phenomenon of sympathetic sneezing/coughing in humans? I know you don't really choose to cough or sneeze in solidarity with others, but maybe it's a similar trait? Also, I'd say if the behavior serves to increase survival chances, it's not really altruistic, since a higher chance of survival is definitely a benefit for the animals engaging in the behavior. I also think I've seen dogs copy their humans in other ways which really seem like their way of saying, ""I like you & I wanna be like you""

Honestly, there are so many reasons dogs might do this, from curiosity to admiration to downright pwnage, but it's rly fun to get high and speculate on animal psychology regardless"
