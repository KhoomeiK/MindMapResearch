My manager came over and asked me what was going on (Cause this was a bit of an anomaly) I explained that it's already past med, and still getting sent back.

He also always wrote about going down on women and licking “the sweet juices” from them. 

As to how we found out, he forgot to X out of the window, or log out, or delete history. Any of it. So the owner came into work the next day and was crying laughing reading through the messages while we all gathered around.
