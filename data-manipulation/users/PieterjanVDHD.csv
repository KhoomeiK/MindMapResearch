2007scape,fffcjxt,t1_fffaoo0,1579880970.0,"Same is true for all artisan skills (crafting, fletching, herblore, cooking) it is just how the economy of runescape functions. 

Xp has value and it drives up the price or resources and devalues the finished products. If using raw resourses gave more xp than now (thus devalueing xp) artisan skills could be profitable. 

Runecrafting would be way less profitable if rune ess were not dropped like rain in a rainforest but actualy behaving like ores do for smithing. Like if you needed level appropriate essense like nature essense to make nature runes and concentraded nature essense to make double nats. In that case I would expect runecrafting profits to easily be a third of what they are now and several lower lvl runes to turn a loss."

Sure they could have installed smoke alarms and they would have been fine(the british consulate could have remained silent). Sure if firefighters had arrived faster the fire would not have spread as far(the iranian goverment escalating and ooops civilians are dead).

todayilearned,fc86iun,t1_fc6s8hp,1577527975.0,"Notice how it says vapour is in a gas phase, not a gas itself. Oxygen can indeed be a liquid and thus also manifest a vapour pressure, just not under normal conditions (293.15 K, 1 bar). The condition usualy implied when labeling something as a solid, liquid or gas. 

Standard conditions are at 273.15K, that is quite a bit colder than normal room temperature. 

Vapours simply behave differently than gasses, for one thing they do not follow the gas laws. 

For example if you compress air (at 1 atm) saturated with water vapour to half it's volume while keeping themperature stable gas laws state the pressure should be 2 atm. However since vapour pressure is part of the equation the result is actualy about 1.98 atm becouse some water vapour condensed."
