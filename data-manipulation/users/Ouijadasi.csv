[KJ21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=KJ21)

Because He hath loosed my cord and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

[ASV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=ASV)

For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.

[AMP](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=AMP)

“For God has loosed His bowstring [attacking me] and [He has] afflicted and humbled me; They have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me.

[AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=AMPC)

For God has loosed my bowstring and afflicted and humbled me; they have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me.

[BRG](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=BRG)

Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

[NCV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=NCV)

God has taken away my strength and made me suffer, so they attack me with all their anger.

[NET](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2030:10-12&version=NET)

Because God has untied my tent cord and afflicted me, people throw off all restraint in my presence.

Okay so what I'm getting from this is that the cord mentioned isn't qualified as anyone's in particular, and calling it a bowstring or a tent string (or a pants string) is context dependent. To get a good perspective on the verb, we need a linguist who isn't also vested in keeping the translation clean."
