They call it deballment, you would fit in will with the other recent scholars who are pioneering this field, however it is risky if you ever want to have children. Putting the balls back in the sack takes a skilled professional, even for just one ball, they are quite slippery. Some have suggested just removing one ball, or even sealing the tubing from the balls to penis so that the balls are bypassed then potentially removing the seal later on, a clog with a purpose if you will. One guy I know just saved a jar of semen before his deballment but he has nightmares about the procedure and his voice has gotten incredibly high pitched.

When the balls swell with pee they make the penis look smaller by comparison. You can then either choose to fix the clog itself or you can use a sterilized sewing needle to  pierce the ballsack 2-3 times, allowing the pee to bypass the clog. This can be a bit messy however, and you will also never be able to hold your pees again unless you seal the pin holes immediately after peeing with super glue and allow 24 hours(don't drink water during this time, for obvious reasons) for it to dry."

WatchPeopleDieInside,feg0rhy,t1_feg0jvh,1579072036.0,"Except that isn't always possible. Many men have emotional issues, mental illnesses, etc. This isn't always some mind over matter bullshit, many grew up horribly abused, as an example. 

Basically saying things like- ""Just have a good upbringing and fit into my definition of how a man should react to his emotions."" sounds ridiculous, because it is.

Also you said it's not bad to expect men to be masculine, I explained why it is. It does actual damage to people's lives. It's not a matter of opinion or a gut feeling/intuition.

Major lack of empathy here by the way. When I see a man having a full on emotional breakdown I immediately wonder what horrible thing happened to them, and wonder if they're going to be ok. Not ""oh they're not being much of a man right now"", what kind of shit is that? What if they just lost their wife and kids to a car accident? For fucks sake."
WatchPeopleDieInside,feg06ll,t1_fefzr06,1579071373.0,"It's bad because saying shit like ""Be a man"" is vitriolic and unnecessary. There will always be manly men out there to fill that role, but shoehorning biological males into this predetermined definition is stupid as fuck. 

To many dumbasses, being a man means you're not allowed to cry, be scared, have emotions, etc. Fuck that. Many men get laid more than these toxic little ""alpha boys""(many who haven't touched a titty in their whole damn lives) on the internet spewing this bullshit but still cry when they're upset. Instead of ""be a man"" how about ""be whatever the fuck you want to be"".

Being masculine is not bad. Expecting every male to be your definition of masculine is bad. Masculinity isn't inherently bad, no, but a poorly thought out No True Scotsman(no real man would cry during a sad movie, for example) expectation of it is definitely bad and negatively effects men. People wonder why men commit suicide more often than women but completely ignore major factors like this."
