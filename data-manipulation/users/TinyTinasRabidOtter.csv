AskReddit,ffv5wjq,t1_ffuef6s,1580256430.0,Currently dealing with this. Insurance if I had it doesn’t cover it and the out of pocket cost is even more insane. So I just deal with it...
AskReddit,ffv4096,t1_ffv2yr4,1580255147.0,"I feel weird. Aura is what I’m told it’s called. Then nothing. Wake up still fuzzy, body hurts, brain hurts, sometimes I can’t talk or move till it’s fully passed and takes me a few days to be my actual self again. I’m on medication and it helps quite a bit."

starbucks,ffsv11x,t3_euxw9u,1580193564.0,Honestly I wish someone actually did recognise me. I tell my beans good job after shifts with a highlight reel of what I saw them do. During shift I’ll compliment techniques
AskReddit,ffrofi3,t1_ffrod4y,1580162276.0,I doubt it. He is not very big on reddit as a whole. Party pooper. Love you babe!

AskReddit,ffpmqel,t1_ffnq3m8,1580098929.0,I’ve told people that I’ve been called a bitch a lot. Usually when I set clear boundaries. But being a proud bitch or asshole is not a good trait.
AskReddit,ffimwh4,t1_ffgbn2i,1579977704.0,"I see you met my ex. He had hundreds when I left him. Hell I admit I had some as well but just the ones I enjoyed when I bought them, but got tired of him painstakingly reboxing mine and getting angry at me for taking them out of the box to display them. He was just dead sure we would make bank in a few years. Spent rent money, pretty much every single dime we had or didn’t have to get the rare ones. It was ridiculous. After not eating for a solid week so my child could I tried to tell him no more. He brought home more. I packed my child and our things and left. He legally abandoned our child (hence why I say mine) as soon as he realised I refused to get back together if he continued the obsession. We needed food and shelter. Not a potential payout. Even if they are worth a ton of money one day, it didn’t fix the fact he didn’t even care if our toddler had enough food as long as he got more funkos and Pokémon cards for his possible eventual big money payout. No thanks."
fatlogic,ffdrdt3,t3_et03by,1579827064.0,"I think once or twice to teach a lesson is fine. My kid ate himself to a tummy ache on candy once, hasn’t done it again. He also refused to eat and got a pretty bad feeling in his stomach, told him that’s why I make sure he eats regularly so that feeling doesn’t happen. He did get into tacos and ate till he threw up when he was older. That one I was sure he didn’t need teaching but he hasn’t done it since lol. I feel like so many parents are encouraging their kids to eat until they can’t hardly move and that’s just not healthy."
