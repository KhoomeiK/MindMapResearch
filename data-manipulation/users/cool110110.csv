No, there are plenty of those out there, but single and couple are just as valid and more common.

Laws vary around the world, but in most places if someone's peering into your windows they're going to be the ones breaking the law. In many countries (e.g. here in England and Wales) it's completely legal to be nude in your garden and out in nature. In any case it's only practical for the tiny number who actually live on club/resort ground to be nude all the time

> Are there nudists my age?

Of course there are, both those who grew up with it and those discovering it now like you.

>  It just feels like something that would be illegal or something.

Remember that there's nothing sexual about just being nude, therefore there's nothing wrong or illegal about it (unless you live in some extremist Muslim country).

> Are nudists like a political movement or is it just people who like being naked. I think it'd be weird if it's a movement but the wiki page kinda makes it sound like a social movement to be naked more.

There's a bit of a debate about this that links into the difference between nudism and naturism (if there is any).
