CallOfDutyMobile,fcw7ld1,t1_fcv4lbo,1578018979.0,"What's wrong with Deep Shark DL-Q33, I observed that even before it was gifted to literally every player in this game , DLQ was used widely in the hands of most of the snipers or was the primary in one of their loadouts with majority (like 85- 90%) of players using the DLQ and like 5 to 8 % players using the Arctic 50. And the remaining using the EBR 14 not even counting in the XPR because I've seen no other player than myself how just gave it a try and replaced it with the DLQ or the Arctic. Moving on, if you talk about the skin specifically, the DLQ was used in its original finish with no prior Credit based skin available for the free playerbase to buy in the store the premium skin like the Locus (which has similar characteristics to the DLQ) was a pay to win thingy and the only players who bought it were the YouTubers and the battlepass owners so once Deep Shark DL-Q33 came out it replaced the original ones in the sniper loadout hence making the Deep Shark DL-Q33 a widely seen skin and weapon.

Also thank you for creating this meme and this comment thread I'm enjoying this community a lot :)"
