AskReddit,fex41xc,t1_feusk6j,1579423959.0," I remember this one. I heard it in like 1998, then it disappeared for several years. Then became popular again. I wonder if it was a regional/national thing, because when I first heard it I lived in the Midwest. Shortly after that I moved to California and didn’t hear it again for years. 

My theory is that, at least for some of these songs, they become popular in a local or regional market. Then disappear for a while before becoming popular nationally.

Edited to add: And nobody I know knew it before. So I’m happy to see your comment because it proves I’m not crazy!"
AskReddit,fewnn8m,t1_fevik2i,1579415953.0,"I had something similar with my childhood cat. I was away at college and had this feeling of something going out of my life. I called my mom to ask her if my grandma was ok, and she told me my cat had died. I didn’t know exactly who I lost when I felt it, but I definitely felt it. 

That same year, another strange thing happened. I had a pet hamster (couldn’t have a cat where I lived and I wanted a pet) and the hamster died. I buried her under a bush near my apartment building. 

Every day on my way home I walked past that bush and would look over at it and remember my poor hamster. About a week later as I walked by, I glanced over like normal, and nearly died of surprise to find a large dog laying hidden under the bush. 

The dog wasn’t in very good shape so I brought it some water and food. The next morning it was still there, so I coaxed it into my car and took it to the shelter where it could get some vet care. 

It was weird because the shelter workers said she probably wouldn’t have lasted much longer out there, but I wouldn’t have even noticed her if I hadn’t buried my hamster under that same bush."
