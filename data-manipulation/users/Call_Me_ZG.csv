This, as it seems, is Ed Woodward’s approach to PR at Manchester United. Appoint Neil Ashton, chief sports writer for The Sun and head croissant ignorer on Sky’s Sunday Supplement. Woodward, who has always struggled to adapt to the unique demands of recruitment, increasingly uses his sidekick Matt Judge. So Ed Woodward employs someone to improve his PR.

And that someone just happens to have made clear his feelings on Woodward’s incompetence on at least one occasion. If Ed Woodward could just persuade United supporters that he’s not really so bad, he’s just cuddly Ed, held back by other, less pure, people. Whether it be audacity, ignorance or incompetence, Manchester United have managed to turn a PR appointment into a PR disaster. The backlash will now go to such a stage that anyone with any remote connection to Ashton will be perceived as parroting PR for United.

Manchester United appointing a well known journalist to soothe their PR has been a story in all the major football countries. That people from Manchester to Mumbai are mocking it, and social media is in full swing, is a mild demonstration of the backlash."

australia,fecg9f6,t1_feccwco,1578973186.0,"That's a good starting point, I tried to do some research but seems a bit more complicated than that

Different particulates are given different weights depending on how dangerous they are. 


So, if I understand correctly two different places could have an entirely different make up and concentration of pollutants but same AQI as it's been deemed to be similar level of dangerous."

australia,febxlbn,t1_febu5se,1578963938.0,"They don't mean much in them selves in the sense that 2 isn't twice as bad as 1 or so. 

But it does serve as a yardstick, 100 and above is bad but not an issue for healthy individuals being exposed to here and there. 400 is stay indoors. Melbourne is typically in single digits when all's normal."

I wouldn't be able to every day of the week but days like today would be fine (air quality is worse at home so I came in though)"

But that guy clearly knows what he's doing, people not familiar with koalas should use a bowl filled with water instead as they drink water by lapping it up"
reddevils,fdqd3kt,t1_fdqbbr7,1578663452.0,"It's trickier than that. Profits can have strings attached and most companies want sustainable growth even if it means investing into the business and having a few bad years

That's literally why there's a question that asks you ""how likely are you to recommend this business to a friend"" etc, when you buy something"
reddevils,fdqbrjv,t1_fdonwkw,1578662323.0,"Honestly I read the article and even that's just a click bait headline.

Their statement following the strikes on the bases directly contradicts with this. Iran is playing a very calculated hand because they don't have the luxury of being the school yard bully 


Plus you don't ""accidentally"" take down the wrong civilian plane, not on their own turf to say the least"

And this holds for most occupations. The bare minimum we should expect from the leaders is to be on the ground making decisions, visiting affected areas, rallying the fire fighters.

FUCKYOUINPARTICULAR,fc82j4j,t1_fc7zqp5,1577525200.0,"Her point is that you're not going to pick up a random chick regardless of how attractive you are. 

Random here doesn't account for social settings like a bar or a social event or places where they'd have known the person existed prior to their interaction. 

In those situations ofcourse attractiveness plays a role, so does how well you dress (which might relate to how much money you have) and all sort of material things but us guys aren't owed attention from women and they can act as hoes or nuns and everything in between if they feel like it because that's their prerogative which they're entitled to. Even if one is unfuckable theyre still probably not doing their odds any favor by going trying to pick up random women (opposed to maybe going at speed dating or just paying for it etc)"
