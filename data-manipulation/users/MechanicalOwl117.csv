mead,ffaxfx3,t1_ff9mcgk,1579746737.0,"Very nice. So question - if you bottle it, you have never had any issues with bottle bombs? I have read in some places that once the fermentation is done, bottling is ok even if cloudy"
selfimprovement,fejxpu9,t3_ep6tod,1579188240.0,"True. Great things come with time. Kind of like cooking. Sure, you can take all the ingredients and throw them in the microwave to save time but the extra time to cook in stages in the oven or stove is well worth the better quality of taste.

Literal food for thought-"

One thing to consider that will help you is controlling your inner mental talk. Your situation of returning home is only temporary and you will soon be back in the dorms bettering yourself. Don’t play into their hand of negativity. If they want to be unsupportive of your goals for advancement, then they can continue to live in their world of toxic bliss (which is in truth a Hell). You are seeing more and striving for more. Your family is there to guide you to a certain point in life an then it is up to you to establish who you want to be.

So in your case, do you want to act and feel like your relatives and end up mimicking where they are currently in life or do you want to keep striving for more and have high ambitions? Although you should still respect them to an extent because they are family, consider them the same as any other factor that would try to keep you down – they are a roadblock that is temporary and should be viewed as such.

Regarding your situation, just remember – if Harry Potter could put up with the BS, you can too. So, Smile."

Energy drainage can be a result of a lot of things. The first steps I would say - watch what you eat (eat quality meals and snacks), make a point to stretch through out your work day, and get good sleep. There may be more extreme issue of why energy is crap, but those 3 are the basic and easiest to address first and test for better results. All 3 can be elaborated in more detail of specifics.

When you get home, make sure to refuel. Have a small snacks or something to recharge your batteries. My personal favorite after an 8-hour work day is a small bowl of cereal (Kashi) and dry fruit.

It seems that you have ideas of what you want to do when you get off work. Try to focus on one at a time. Having to many options can overwhelm your subconscious and make you feel drained on the idea of making a choice in the end. When your next idea comes up, write it down and focus only on making that one thing happen. Over time of thinking of it, it will develop into a plan of commitment.

Example-

\-I want to read a new book-

\-Commit to reading 10 pages, then another 10, then another 10

\-Enjoy a favorite beer or tea while reading

\-Can’t concentrate at home; go to coffee shop

\-Read non spoiler online articles to entice my interest more

Speaking of reading, that was one of my goals a few years back. I decided to commit to reading 20 pages of a novel a day and was marking it on the calendar. Now I consistently read daily. Some days more, but typically always 30-40. It has become a habit and my grammar thanks me for it."
mead,fe4hf6u,t3_enpjbu,1578859336.0,"Nice! Post back about how it turns out! I was actually considering picking up that book, running through all the recipes and making a youtube channel dedicated to elaborating upong them. I kinda left the idea though because I figure its been done an played out. Alot of channels review the recipes but in my opinion I do not enjoy most of them. They are 20-30 mins long, do not simply elaborate upon specific subjects (price, taste, serving sizes, nutrition, etc.), and its alot of filler video of people just playing around. Idk, was an idea."
selfimprovement,fe312gx,t3_enh6bl,1578844882.0,"Keep strong to stay off the stuff if you feel it is needed. Some people can handle using it responsibly and some cant. If your gut is telling you to stop, then listen. I am 31 and stopped smoking at 22 and can honestly see that my life and the quality of people around me have drastically improved. I have nothing against those who want to smoke but it was a eye opening and sad day when I decided to stop and my ""friends"" didn't deem it worth while to hang out with me since I didn't want to partake in smoking. I do note that I didn't try to make them stop and still didn't mind being around it. At one point I asked why I was not invited to chill and play videogames with my normal crew and unanimously everyone agreed that is wasn't worth me being there because I did't smoke anymore. Those people now are either still broke and going nowhere in life, in prison, or have dropped off the face of the earth into the unknown. 

On the flip side, one guy I know who smoked and still does - He is married of now 6 years, has 2 kids, and works in Accounting/Payroll as a Specialized Account Manager. We still speak from time to time and play chess online.

Alot of food for though\~"
selfimprovement,fdhna03,t3_elaj7d,1578426256.0,"I have felt the similar struggle at that age. Was 21, recently divorced, homeless couch surfing, had a crappy job in retail, rode the bus or biked, and survived off of $20 a week. I had pretty much no guidance of how life worked growing up (my dad left the family at young age and my mom was a stress case). Was involved in smoking weed daily, chain smoking cigs, getting drunk, and causing problems with the few friends I had. I was also very shy by nature and the simplest things stressed me out. I would make a mountain out of the smallest grains of the mole hill.

The turning point for me was honestly when I decided that I was tired of losing in life. I was tired of not knowing my potential, being seen as a joke, being uneducated, being known as an unreliable shit talker, not having a place to call home, having flaky “friends” in my life, having a unjustified sense of self entitlement, being generally useless as a human, SICK OF BEING ME. 

Eventually I started to drown myself in literally anything self-help or positivity related.. Books, Facebook groups, youtube channels, etc. I wanted to tear myself up and become someone completely different Eventually I even stopped talking to most of my friends because I came to find they where generally toxic as well; but they saw nothing wrong with their attitudes and the way they handled themselves. I was even ridiculed by them for openly seeking change. 

Leading to my current state at 31 - I eventually found faith spiritually, I regularly compete athletically, graduated college, have held a well-paying job for 5 years with a good company, have my own place with a woman I love, and ambitions that continue to grow.

To sum up, here are a few points I would recommend:

1. Want and crave change daily – change is work day after day. It coincides with life and it doesn’t ever go away. If you are weak in a certain area, single that area out and focus hardcore on working on it for a week. After a week, make it feel more like a mandatory habit. Google how to address those weaknesses. View it as a demon you want to slay and a daily agenda to address. 

2. Listen to motivating things throughout the day – it’s true that wherever you focus, your mind will follow. If you keep being told (by others or yourself) that you are crap, then you will be. If you tell yourself you are strong, capable, and willing to change for the better – then results will follow. View it like working out – in the beginning it is tough, but you will become stronger. 

3. Set goals for yourself – whatever your immediate life desires are, set a goal to accomplish it. Your goals will become your standard of how you handle yourself. Example: Looking for a job – Apply to one company that is hiring daily. At the end of each day, reflect upon how much effort you have made in all areas and the successful goals accomplished. Here is the thing though, over time your goals will change, become grander, and you will eventually have multiple goals to address BUT as you become better, this will not be as intimidating as you think. 

4. Surround yourself with the right people and role models – you are the average of who you surround yourself with. If people are contributing negatively to your life and agenda, cut them out. Its better to be alone and growing that surrounded by a lake of poison. In my stage in life, I have only 3 people I would call my friends (and I live with one of them and barely see the other 2 because life is busy)

Hopefully this helps. Feel free to message. 

My favorite life quotes:

“Strife is good – strife makes a man strong. For if a man is capable of confronting death daily, functioning in the face of it – there is no telling what else that man can do, and a man whose limits cannot be known, is a very hard man to defeat in battle.”

“How many times have you been defeated?

how many times have you been depressed?

how many times have you taken the beating?

how many times have you been put to the test?”

spartanrace,fdgul34,t1_fdgf4du,1578408706.0,"I saw it and thought it was interesting. Its true that with a sustained diet like that it is possible for greater results, but as ootuoyetahi had said, it seems that they did hand pick a lot of scenarios that support the initial focus. This isn’t to say that the diet is not valid, it’s but the documentary in my opinion is a gateway to entice the interest of a person to do additional research. A lot of the documentaries I have see on extreme spectrum diet choices don’t fully express the in’s and out’s, but then again, they are not supposed to."

I can’t stand this game but for some reason my girlfriend loves to play it even though by the end of it we are irritated even if we win. The whole purpose of the game is to defeat the mastermind. We lose 90% of the time and if we win its by the skin of our teeth. The cards overall are highly unbalanced. We once had 5 plus turns where neither of us could do anything because almost all of the villain cards rape you. If you attack the mastermind – negative affect inflicted. If you attack any of the henchmen of the field – negative affect inflicted. Draw a scheme twist (the evil agenda that the mastermind is enacting) – negative affect inflicted.  Hell, even some of the hero cards you can use have negative effects on the other players. 

A typical screwed few turns-

1. Cant play my hand because I have 3 wounds (trash non useable cards of affliction), 2 money (literally cant buy anything), and 1 attack (really….)

2. Next hand I only have 3 cards (instead of 6) from scheme twist on other players turn: 3 money (enough to buy 1 hero card that goes into my graveyard)

3. Next hand start with 4 cards (instead of 6) 2 wounds , 2 money. Can do anything so I pass my turn in order to permanently rid myself of the 2 wound cards. 

4. NEXT TURN!! I receive 2 NEW wounds from enemy card affects. Of the 6 cards in my hand I literally can not do anything! 

This game looks pretty and that is about it. I would rather play literally any Marvel videogame to get my superhero fix than to play this. This game is so built upon making the enemies so nerfed that it really doesn’t need you to play. The game plays out how it wants. Your not playing the game, you are attending the service and rolling with whatever cards it gives you."
