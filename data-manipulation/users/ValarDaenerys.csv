toddlers,ff4v56k,t1_ff3vymo,1579573187.0,Oh and his hearing is fine. He had hearing issues due to ear infections but he has tubes and his hearing test was normal.
toddlers,ff4v38n,t1_ff3vymo,1579573150.0,"Yeah thanks for this. I realize now we were all super tired and grumpy from the disruptions of travel. Today I had him home from daycare and we had a great day. I basically let him yell, didn‚Äôt react, kept it positive and he responded (took a while but he did eventually come around). I‚Äôm starting to see that he needs to feel like he‚Äôs in control of his life. He has anxiety about it and now that I see that, I will try to be more sensitive to his needs. Exactly like you said about giving him notice about changes. We‚Äôre using timers and that helps a ton."
toddlers,ff4urfo,t1_ff3skg0,1579572926.0,"The coaching involves play therapy and I‚Äôll warn you, it‚Äôs not the easiest thing to wrap your brain around. Basically you reset the relationship, give them opportunities to lead and make choices while taking the lead in other settings. And heaps of positive interaction. It was working before we went on vacation but that disrupted his routine and sleep and boom huge meltdowns and yelling."
toddlers,ff4uk28,t1_ff3wtid,1579572785.0,Yes he‚Äôs in daycare and he‚Äôs a sweetie there. Of course lol. He‚Äôs not the most social kid though - they‚Äôre working on that. He usually goes straight to the books or blocks and plays on his own.
toddlers,ff3127j,t1_ff26cbp,1579530835.0,"Thank you. We‚Äôre exploring all options, including diet and sleep. It‚Äôs NOT normal. We‚Äôre trying parent coaching and play therapy. But we may have to escalate to a straight kid psychologist or behaviorist."
aww,ff01b8z,t3_eqxs7f,1579464073.0,The Russian judge gave him a 5.
stepparents,fezs5ui,t1_fevsd8e,1579460956.0,"I disagree. I love my first step mom and 30 years on from their divorce, we still see each other as often as we can. I also have a great relationship with my current step mom. So it depends. But it was very much my desire to keep her in my life. My dad was the problem and the reason they divorced."
beyondthebump,fep386g,t1_feosjze,1579311132.0,"My kid‚Äôs demeanor VASTLY improved after CIO. Because he finally was sleeping well. He learned how to put himself to sleep and go back to sleep when he woke. No psychological harm - my kiddo‚Äôs a sweetie, very smart and doing great."
beyondthebump,fep30i1,t1_feojnks,1579310996.0,Disagree. CIO saved our sanity at 5 months old.
beyondthebump,fep2vc8,t1_feox7it,1579310905.0,LOVE THE MERLIN. Game changer. We‚Äôre still having 2-3 wake ups (breastfeeding) but I get a solid 4-5 hour stretch to start. Then 3 hours and 2.
beyondthebump,fep2qvc,t1_feoklib,1579310827.0,"Rocking is ok. Honestly you just want baby to sleep when they‚Äôre that age, regardless of method. You can get more focused on a method once they‚Äôre past 3 months."
beyondthebump,fep2ltv,t1_feokvuh,1579310738.0,"Don‚Äôt cry it out until they‚Äôre around 5 months. You have to get past the 4 month sleep regression and allow them to develop enough. When they‚Äôre younger, they still need to be comforted and fed 2-3 times a night or more. Source: we did CIO with a trainer when our baby was 5 months. BEST THING EVER."

tifu,fdno5xi,t3_em9c88,1578589800.0,"My little sister was a toddler when Salt n Pepa‚Äôs ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk About Sex‚Äù came out. I was singing it all the time never thinking she was absorbing it. We were all in the car and out of nowhere, this 2 year old sings, LETS TALK ABOUT SEX BABEEEE. My mom was like, wth, where did she learn that? I was laughing hysterically. It was friggin adorable. And I was proud."
Catsmirin,fdn28fm,t1_fdm1ht4,1578575085.0,So true. My Sal was that cat. I had trouble breathing after he passed. Like I was shattered. Toughest loss of my life.
Catsmirin,fdn23ha,t3_em0sg1,1578574960.0,"My god she loved you. That‚Äôs the kind of love that continues. My soul kitty visits me in dreams and meditation. Willow is part of you and lives in your heart. You‚Äôll always be together.,"

aww,fdaf0t1,t3_ekdkos,1578245331.0,Senior babies are the best!!! So much love here.
todayilearned,fd4gz3v,t1_fd42wn3,1578167383.0,Try Evivo for the reflux and colic. It‚Äôs a probiotic. Took my 6 week old from fussy and gassy to mostly chill.
todayilearned,fd4gc6t,t1_fd3ydjg,1578167250.0,"Don‚Äôt worry, we have a 3 year old and he‚Äôs obsessed with dad. They have a blast together and dad gets him all the toys he wanted when he was a kid. With me, we read together and cuddle. I love it when he says, Stay mommy! It‚Äôs the thought that someday he will rather be with his friends that makes me sad."

LifeProTips,fd2eksq,t3_ejrnej,1578146099.0,"Got a call from Apple. Answered it, they said my iTunes had been breached in Texas and New York. They wanted my screen time password. That‚Äôs when I got suspicious and said, that makes no sense. Why do you need that? ‚ÄúFor the breach.‚Äù I said no, I think this is a scam. And the guy cursed and hung up on me. Called the real Apple and they confirmed it was scammers and that Apple will never call me for info like that. Felt like an idiot but the caller ID said Apple!"
beyondthebump,fcyb9am,t1_fcxnhk3,1578077559.0,Ditto. I wish I could be a perfect mom.
AskReddit,fcv39ru,t3_eixc75,1577993749.0,Currently nursing baby #2 I had with my Tinder babe. Best swipe right of my life.
beyondthebump,fcu69ep,t1_fctpq9b,1577973564.0,I VBAC‚Äôed this time around and had a 2nd degree tear. Glad I didn‚Äôt have another c section because I have a toddler but it was a tough first few weeks. Very swollen and had sutures for tear. But it was worth it not to have surgery again. Happy to chat if you want.
beyondthebump,fcu61hj,t3_eiu69u,1577973422.0,Oh Jesus the fear of that first poop. I had a midwife say just let it fall out of you.
happycryingdads,fct4lwu,t1_fcqrxn4,1577932741.0,Yup wondering the same.
BabyBumps,fcndw87,t3_ehzr9w,1577809660.0,"Wow, that‚Äôs...so hard to read. I‚Äôm so sorry mama but man are you a warrior! I too had major shortness of breath - even had a panic attack over it (I never had this during first pregnancy). It lasted throughout this pregnancy but no one ever mentioned it might be PE. Thank you for raising awareness!"
photoshopbattles,fclvnmy,t1_fclv9gt,1577757582.0,Yasss UFC kitty!
happycryingdads,fc9yz9y,t3_egp3wq,1577560313.0,Ok so I‚Äôm sobbing now. I love that his name is Mike.
beyondthebump,fc5we60,t3_egcc5b,1577467312.0,If only this had happened while my son was a baby. Well over a year old lol after weaning.
ADHD,fbq8zuc,t1_f4yoac0,1577029457.0,"I second this. I was a summer camp counselor and my kids with ADHD all had much better behavior and seemed calmer and happier after we worked them out with runs or outdoor games, etc. They were some of my favorite kids, btw. Good luck with your daughter - my son has sensory processing and speech delay and it can be difficult handling him at times. But he‚Äôs only 3, you know?"
