Also, my advice for your bangs is just to power through and rely on your headband, or get into hats. My hair is 18"" longer than yours and I still wear a hat almost every day to help control things.

Don't cut your bangs if you can help it, and in another 9 months you'll one day realize that your hair isn't as annoying as it was."

rawdenim,ffcjcee,t1_ffcikfg,1579800694.0,"I have 2% elastane Naked & Famous jeans. They are sold as 'stretch' jeans. I know how much they stretch. 

Additionally my wife has other 2% jeans that DO feel more like leggings or a T-shirt than denim, due I suspect to the thin fabric more than anything."
rawdenim,ffchpxl,t3_esueqh,1579799706.0,"Maybe it's the crappy photos they have on their website but this fabric is way too shiny, and as far as I know about Women's fashion (very little; just what I hear my wife talk about) high rise is coming back but this seems ridiculous. The box and waist are so tall it seems like they should have bells on the bottom.

You're right that women are left behind with raw/selvedge denim but IMO this is not the way forward.

What I'd like to see is a low-tension midweight denim (Oni, Momotaro, Samurai) with a lot of natural lateral stretch in the 'standard' women's slim or skinny silhouette. My wife has some older Express jeans (5+ years) with 2% stretch that has really great texture and feels like denim should, not like a cotton legging.

I think in general, a successful raw denim launch for women would not be super crazy in cut and should emphasize details and fabric (this 9oz looks pretty boring to me).

Edit: I know A) these Lee jeans have no elastane, B) 2% elastane is not Spandex and C) I'm not gonna die on this hill. Enjoy downvoting, I guess. Hell I'll join the brigade if it makes y'all feel better. LOL"
MensLib,ff9mi4r,t1_ff7yu1f,1579716101.0,"I worked with some guys who were very tall ( around or above 7 ft) and even in that short period of less than a year _I_ got sick and tired of people like you commenting on his height. You're not that funny, and no tall person enjoys being interrogated by every stranger who sees them.

Protip: people who say things like ""I'm a good person"" or ""I'm really funny"", generally... Aren't."
FierceFlow,ff94k73,t1_ff93by8,1579704681.0,"You're welcome! I used to not really care what hat I wore so long as it kept my hair out of my eyes, but my wife loves to see me in hats so I've become something of a minor expert lol

Definitely go to a store where you can feel them and try them on. Hat sizes are also really irregular so unless they provide circumference measurements, you won't know if it fits until you wear it."
FierceFlow,ff93cq1,t3_es3sa3,1579703841.0,"Looks good to me. I went at least 4 years before I got my first trim, but to each their own. :)"
FierceFlow,ff922gd,t1_ff8zeec,1579702919.0,"It's expensive, but I can recommend Kiehls hair products. I have extremely fine hair and the Kiehls amino acid shampoo has really made it more controllable and smooth. If the shampoo alone makes your hair too 'loose', use a bit of their amino acid conditioner. They also have a one-step shampoo specifically for men if you don't want to do the shampoo and conditioner thing. A little goes a long way."
FierceFlow,ff91cx8,t1_ff8zvf4,1579702386.0,"It really depends on your personal style as to the type and textile of the hat. That said, I prefer brimmed caps to keep the sun from my eyes, but I also have a few fedoras and porkpies, as well as some wide-brimmed 'cowboy' style ones.

Brimmed caps like a newsboy, fisherman's cap, flat cap, or ivy cap are great entry level hats. You can get them in neutral and solid colors as well as a wide variety of patterns and textures. 

I almost never wear the cowboy/Aussie hats just because I don't like negotiating the hat around things, but nothing says you can't rock a cowboy hat with long hair.

The porkpie and fedora hats are a great way to mix casual with dressy or to dress up a nicer outfit, but you can run the risk of looking like a hipster douchebag if you pick the wrong one or wear it with the wrong thing. I would say these hats have a higher skill level requirement. :) Or maybe you have a fashionable friend who can help you pick one out.

Brixton and Stetson both have the hats you're looking for and in a wide range of prices. Amazon sells both. You can get a basic cotton ivy cap for about $35 from Stetson and a Brixton newsboy will cost about the same.

Edit: forgot to mention Kangol. If you want something specific for hot weather, Kangol makes a newsboy in a slightly stretchy mesh weave that looks kind of like wicker. I have one and it's great when it's hot out, and again they make lots of different patterns and colors."
FierceFlow,ff6okz9,t3_ervot1,1579631617.0,"Second on the hat comment. You can get a stylish, comfy hat for less than $60 anywhere and it will last for years. Hats are 100% an amazing way to keep your hair out of your face."
FierceFlow,fez7xtp,t3_eqw1si,1579454620.0,"I get trims every few months / when I feel like it. Honestly though, I THOROUGHLY brush my hair a couple times a day and even though this is supposed to be 'bad' for my hair, I feel it keeps the split ends and kinked hairs to a minimum.

Also my wife recently encouraged me to jump for Kiehls shampoo (alternate between the Amino Acid and the Men's one-step) and I think it's definitely improved the overall look of my hair."
BlackMetal,fenh4uq,t1_femyqyo,1579284573.0,"If you have not already, check out Shylmagoghnar and Far Beyond. I'm sure you know Wilderun and Wintersun, and there's Lör from Pennsylvania. Also blackened death/symphonic death like Gorgon, DragonLord, CHTHONIC, and Sulphur Aeon. You might enjoy melodic death like Mors Principium Est or Brymir, or Be'lakor (personal favorite)."
todayilearned,fehnzk0,t1_fehnkkh,1579120406.0,"Good job. However, this is still not evidence that all cats should be euthanized to counter the environmental impact.

Reduce and control, sure. But cats control other pests as well. Remove them entirely and you cause another problem."
todayilearned,fehmldj,t1_fehmeul,1579119602.0,Yeah. In that ecosystem. This is not proof of his claim that all felines are only destructive in any outdoor environment.
todayilearned,fehm7bn,t1_fehll1w,1579119377.0,"LOL. what, just no. I'm not a bleeding-heart by any stretch but you're going to need to source some kind of data to show that cats are always a detrimental influence to their environment. In fact the fact that we've domesticated them at all is pretty solid evidence that you're wrong."

Aenimus didn't behave that crazy here! Kinda sounds like Vale of Pnath's vocalist spitting phlegm wads into the air and over the crowd.

Anyway after Kalmah we talked to people around the merch booths for a bit and then left when Ensiferum started. Kalmah was at the merch booth as well but we didn't feel like standing in line. They were so happy and cheerful on stage and we were basically all the way in front so it seemed like we'd already met them. LOL

But yeah, kickass good time."

dankvideos,feaeent,t1_fe8zmwo,1578947650.0,I highly doubt they are mixing water and liquid nitrogen. That would create an instant reaction and not need the shaking to create an explosion.

diyaudio,fe9h4jf,t1_fe9efez,1578937530.0,"Just like any studio setup, it depends on your hardware capabilities and skill with mixing. :D

Going this route your investment will be higher, too. You need a mixer with 7 inputs w/ phantom and you'll need a couple banks of headphone amps to control individual volume. Plus the mics, of course. I guess you could run line out from the mixer to a patch board and then from there into line in on each PC and do the volume control on each player's computer.... 

But it sounds to me like you don't know what you're doing and you could fry a sound card if you're not careful."
diyaudio,fe98eqj,t3_eo6tv5,1578935319.0,"Ditto the headset and mic comment, but if it's crazy loud you could get throat mics or stage earpiece mics and run them through a mixer like a studio talkback circuit."
Documentaries,fe97vna,t1_fe8wp3c,1578935140.0,"I've used an early form of this kind of tech when I worked on a range. Raytheon needed field testing for a production unit so we spent a couple days wearing out barrels (and fingers, loading 100's of magazines) on M-16's and ARs to get the 15k rounds the scope needed.

The scope was pretty badass. 100% thermal and during the Texas summer days looking through it was like any other scope, except for the fact that everything was monochrome. Kind of a grey/green shade. You could see the bullets flying downrange. At the time the scope was classified so those of us without clearance didn't get to use it in the dark.

You can see newer versions this technology in YouTube videos where night video is basically full-color daylight vision."

askscience,fe8nrh9,t1_fe87etg,1578928346.0,"I actually disagree. As someone said below; the best way to make emotionally balanced, resilient, empathetic people is to treat them with kindness and respect and care.

What you're calling an over focus on trauma removal is actually coddling, which is infantilization. This is another form of abuse and like bullying, also removes agency from individuals and slowly degrades their sense of being. The problem is not that society is 'too safe', it's that in the name of safety we're limiting what life options people have. (see: post-9-11 TSA security theater) 

Bullying and abuse of various kinds will occur in the lives of everyone over time. And yes. Resilience through that stress makes us stronger. But in the same way, eating dirt or slightly spoiled food or being around sick people can boost our immune system - but we don't seek out deliberate, continuous exposure to these threats.

I'm almost 40 and for my whole life I've been sporadically mocked for my stutter. It was never frequent, but it hurt every time. In my late teens and early 20's I began to feel sorry for people who felt they needed to put me down in any way. Today I would mostly ignore it. But the fact is that it would still hurt me, deep inside.

Anyone who would excuse casual, pointless cruelty as a 'learning experience' might want to think about their motivations.

Edit: a professional view on this shows that bullied people are MORE likely to convert stressful situations into trauma: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/eo1czz/can_pyschopaths_have_traumatic_disorders_like_ptsd/fe8uegx"

rawdenim,fdhb270,t3_elemg0,1578419179.0,"I've just recently gotten a pair of Vans. This is the first non-boot I've owned in close to 20 years. It felt weird the the first week and at first I thought they looked best with my tapered jeans, but now that my head is adjusted to the look I have no issues with any of my jeans.

I wear my tapers over boots so why not straights over sneakers? Wear what makes you feel good, my man, and your attitude will make it work.

As for cuffs, mine are usually tall, but if I want to 'dress up' a little I will double the cuff so it has a nice flat rolled look. I don't have light colored shoes so I don't have to worry about crocking, so I don't cuff them too high, either.

tl;dr : rock your look and don't sweat it too much."
rawdenim,fciy5cx,t1_fcira0p,1577672627.0,"I definitely prefer my jeans post-wash. The denim is just nicer after it shrinks up and the starch is out.

Don't use hand soap. I just use plain powdered detergent (no bleach or whiteners) but a very very small amount. Also a soak can often be just fine if you agitate them a bit. You can use your hands if you're nervous but gentle cycle should be fine. The washer is not going to damage the fabric, but too much / wrong soap will make your jeans smell and feel weird."
