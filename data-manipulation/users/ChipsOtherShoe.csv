AskTrumpSupporters,ffakscx,t1_ff9ue9d,1579738225.0,"Did you read the sources you posted?

the first 2 you linked are the same thing just hosted on different sites and is a journalist's take on a scientific paper.  Science journalists are generally mocked for not fully understanding what they are writing about.

The third one doesn't list an author so i have no clue if they are reputable.  It also says ""and that the regions most exposed to the risks of climate change are very often the ones that are least responsible for causing them and least equipped to deal with them"" which is what people advocating for policy changes say as well.

The next one is talking about the first 2 and advocates ""Sensible solutions now will help ensure that our children and grandchildren will prosper in a world that's not too hot, not too cold, but just right.""

The next one is the scientific paper that is referenced in your first two and actually advocates for a carbon tax.

The next one talks about how warmer weather will help farmers in cold climates in the short term but will hurt overall food supplies in the long term.

And the last one just says that cold weather kills people more than hot weather, this is an objective truth but without comparing it to the long term effects of famine that the other articles are expecting it's not really useful information in arguing against climate change.

So what about these sources make you think that climate change is a good thing?"
