AskReddit,ffzsn9e,t1_ffz6iyn,1580391743.0,"Private jets tend to be in huge demand, especially newer ones. Some models can accumulate orders in the dozens or hundreds before production even begins and production rates are usually in the order of a few planes a *month.* So waiting times of several years aren't uncommon.

LateStageCapitalism,ffxk6k1,t1_ffx3i8j,1580326797.0,"Definitely. The issue here is that the ""problem"" you're solving is a person dying.

If you just do a shit job fixing a computer so the old lady who doesn't know anything about tech keeps coming back to your store, that's ""just"" kinda scummy. But refusing to alleviate human suffering for profit is a whole different level."
LateStageCapitalism,ffxjyp3,t1_ffxakcb,1580326668.0,"No, but you can adjust formulation and prices in such a way that people survive but don't get cured. Many current therapies for various illnesses don't cure the patient. They suppress the illness but also require lengthy and sometimes lifelong treatment. HIV treatment works this way. The virus becomes functionally undetectable but the patient needs to take a cocktail of expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.

Now, I don't think pharma corporations are actually hiding a one-shot cure for Aids or cancer or whatever somewhere. I think it's more a Batman ""I won't kill you but I don't have to save you either""-situation. They don't hide a cure from the world but they're not *particularly* interested in developing one either. Because while it would be sensational news, the current therapies are a lot more lucrative."
LateStageCapitalism,ffwu0dr,t1_ffwscbt,1580310971.0,"I'm not sure. Okay, maybe I used the wrong terminology, sorry. If direct healthcare like hospitals should be government run is a different topic. But I don't know if there is a non-private alternative to the pharma industry (I admit bias since my dad used to work for Roche). Yea, they generally are profit oriented but on the other hand, they invest staggering amounts of money into research and development. Money that the state simply doesn't *have* and which, in a large part, come from the profits from selling healthcare supplies.

I'm not saying that's a perfect system. I'm just pointing out that it's not entirely evil and that I don't know of a feasible alternative."
LateStageCapitalism,ffwsnbs,t1_ffwlbj0,1580310051.0,"From skimming the article, it kinda mixes several definitions of ""poverty"" and ""wealth"".

But in general, the USA is a country of staggering inequality. First of all between the rich, coastal urban centers — which are generally wealthier and more technologically advanced than almost the entire rest of the world — and the vast rural landscapes in the center, which often are closer to lower developed countries in, for example, southeastern Europe. Since most people only know the rich, highly developed urban centers, that especially gives the *perception* of wealth.

The other factor is simple maths. If I own $1'000'000 and you own $1, our average wealth is $500'000.50, which is a lot of money. Yet you as an individual would be incredibly poor. Same idea in the US. A tiny percentage of Americans, we're talking maybe a few hundred (?) are so incredibly wealthy that it's difficult to even comprehend. They're so staggeringly rich that, even if you averaged out their entire wealth across over 300 million people, every individual appears to ""possess"" significant financial wealth, even if they're almost insolvent at best and in massive debt at worst.

That also applies to the GDP, which isn't really related too much to how individuals make. But the US is home to several extremely productive brands, like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Boeign, Amazon and so on. The revenue they generate is enormous and if that's averaged across all Americans, it gives a high GDP, even if most Americans never profit from that revenue in any way."

LateStageCapitalism,ffwkb0p,t1_ffwa3lr,1580303737.0,Not quite sure why you're downvoted...that's pretty much how it works in Switzerland. Healthcare isn't free and I'm not sure it should be. But through the system of health insurance it's *functionally* free.

AskReddit,ffuc84p,t3_ev2c48,1580238916.0,"Working 8+ hours a day, from morning till evening, for five consecutive days.

There's no precedent for this structure and most scientific research indicates that fewer hours would be *more* productive. And while everyone working the same hours, during the day, consecutively, may have made sense in a 19th century factory, there's little to no reason in most jobs in the 21st century. Working fever hours in total, working during the preferred time of day, taking longer breaks, all that would increase productivity and worker satisfaction and, as a bonus, reduce the rush hour stress on transport infrastructure. And yet, this whole 9-5/Mo-Fr model is just kinda accepted as the ideal, for some reason."

AskReddit,ffu7vkm,t3_ev67eq,1580236341.0,"Paleo-diet. I'm an archeology student with primary interest in the paleolithic, so this one baffles me.

Imagine that, decades of research but the people to finally figure out what prehistoric humans ate aren't molecular biologists or isotope physicists or anthropologists or archaeological scientists or archaeologists or even ethnologists. No, it's a bloke with a PhD in ""Exercise Physiology"" and some food bloggers eating kale chips in front of their Macbooks.

And even if you go by what was *available* to paleolithic people instead of what they actually ate, almost no plants easily available today to the modern consumer have much in common with their wild ancestors. In many cases, the wild ancestors may not even exist anymore.

I don't have any beef with the diet itself. You can eat nothing but oak leaves for all I care and I don't know enough about nutrition to judge its merits. But don't give it a name and a made-up backstory/justification that implies you know more about a topic than people who dedicate their entire careers to the topic in question."
