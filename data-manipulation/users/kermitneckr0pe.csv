I don't tell jokes about dead people around someone who's lost a loved one and is still grieving (My friend lost her mom a few years ago and we love dead people jokes. I don't know about other people, but my friend and I deal with trauma and sad things with humor. It just calms us down). I don't tell rape jokes to someone who I know has been raped. I don't tell sexist jokes at all (they just bug me. I don't hate them, though). I don't tell dark jokes relating to any religion and/or belief, unless it's a flat-earther or anti-vaxxer (man, i don't stop with the dark jokes with those people). I don't tell 9/11 jokes. Otherwise, dark jokes are hilarious (when it is said well. if it's more about being dark, i hate it) :D"
AskReddit,fefgc66,t3_dz0iue,1579055736.0,"1. When people say that something wholesome or heartwarming was staged. I know, there are people that stage these things, but it gets annoying when people just want to have faith in humanity and pretend this world isn't going to shit and some dude pops up and says it's fake.

2. When someone chews with their mouth open. Do I even have to explain??

3. When someone always brings negativity. I get it, there's people that do this so they won't feel jealous/envious, or whatever reason they do, but again, it is annoying. I seriously hate it when people do this. Like I once saw this video where this dude posted positive notes all around her school and in the comments, there was a whole group of people basically saying that she didn't mean it and that it was staged. :v"

AskReddit,febwwy4,t3_eo6l00,1578963641.0,"1. My school doesn't allow people to wear hoodies that are any other color than red, black, or white during P.E. This one dude found it kind of stupid (oH nO, people will look at my blue hooDie and stoP in theiR tracKs to staRe at mE, oH nOOo) and started wearing neon pink hoodies everyday. He was told multiple times to go change, and he did...into other colors of pink. He got detention so many times, and had such a bad grade in P.E (they grade us on our clothing, too. I find it kinda stupid that we HAVE to wear our P.E clothes, i mean, who cares if someone doesn't wear their frickin P.E pants for one or two days?? and who cares if someone's hoodie is blue, green, etc.??) :v We started to catch on to what he was doing, but before we could do anything, they changed the rule and now we can wear whatever color of hoodies we want. The P.E teachers were so annoyed when they heard about it, though-

2. Another one relating to P.E clothes. During P.E, girls couldn't wear jeans. As a result, everyone was angry because it gets down to 20-35 degrees where I live in the winter. The first rebel was my friend who wore jeggings. She couldn't get in trouble because they were still leggings.  We caught on to it and eventually they said ""Screw it"" and let us wear jeans."

AskReddit,fdjczpe,t3_eld4mi,1578465778.0,"1. I said it smelled like my grandma's house (which smells amazing in my opinion) and I got detention for it.

2. I got in trouble for playing tag (they didn't allow people to run on the blacktop, but they had been doing some work on the field, so we couldn't play on the field). Dude, if the field is closed off, the students are gONNA run on the blacktop-

3. Again, at a different school, I got in trouble while playing tag. I was chasing my friend and tripped and accidentally kicked him. A random girl that was known to tell on eVeRyBoDy (no hate, but she would tell on us for EVERYTHING, even for passing notes-) saw me kick my friend out of context and told a yard duty. I got detention.

4. My whole grade as a whole got in trouble. We had a stoplight thing in our cafeteria that measured our voice level. If it got to red, we had to sit in the cafeteria for a minute. The longer we talked, the more time got added on. The thing is, my school was HUGE. And my grade had a lot of students, too; I think there were about 500-700 students in the fourth grade.

5. I got in trouble for being insecure about myself. I basically told my friend that I hated my body and didn't want to come to school anymore. My teacher heard and gave me a long lecture about how I shouldn't ever think that way. The thing is, she wasn't saying it in a ""nice"" way. She sounded very annoyed with me (which honestly didn't help at all) and was treating me like I was a criminal for being insecure.

6. I got in trouble for not doing my homework. nOW WAIT, LEMME EXPLAIN. My sister was going in and out of the hospital at the time and I spent all my time with her because we weren't sure if she was going to die or not (she's doing much better now), which left me little to no time to do my homework. I got a behavior slip for ""defiance"" and was sent up to the office (basically, they send you up to the office and make you talk to the vice principal if you get a behavior slip. I told him this and he let me off the hook as long as I did as much homework as I could during my free-time).

7. We couldn't do any sort of handshake. They said it was gang-related. I didn't know this at the time and came up with a secret handshake for me and my friends. I got detention.

8. I got in trouble for asking a question. My math teacher would constantly say that we could ask each other questions as long as we kept quiet. I spoke a bit too loud while asking for help (I didn't want to ask the teacher a question because she was terrifying) and was sent outside for the rest of the period.

9. I got in trouble for talking during school dance performances. Oh, it wasn't because of the performances, it was because my teacher was grading papers during dance peRFORMANCES."
