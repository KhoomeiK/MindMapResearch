On the original topic, I hope that I was able to convince you that the ID thing is also a victim of today’s dysfunctional government.  

Each side just screams yes or no to IDs without solving the REAL problem.  It is more than a hassle for some to obtain an ID and this has to be fixed before requiring them."
UpliftingNews,ffbz9ga,t1_ffbxrtw,1579787419.0,"Yes the real ID system is what I'm referring to.  The actual costs to me will probably end up near $100 for the fee and all of these out-of-state certified documents plus at least 1/2 day from work if not a full day.

Definitely a pita for me but completely doable as I have my own reliable car, reasonable employer, and enough funding.

It's about $50 a pop for certified birth certificates, marriage certificates, etc.  so I was lucky I had all but one in-hand.

These are just bureaucratic headaches for me but it would be insurmountable for some who are working two jobs, caring for children/elderly, etc.

Take the certificate agencies.  You can't even order a certificate snail mail - they only overnight it at a cost of $30 or more.  Not everyone can just take time off work easily or travel out of state to pick up their certificate.

I'm not against the IDs.  In fact, I always worry some day I'm going to walk in to vote and I show up as having already voted.

But going down this path without providing ways to help \*everyone\* get these ids is wrong and will definitely shut out people that the government intends to silence.

Of course, due to electoral college, my vote in 2016 was taken from my candidate of choice and given to the other candidate so yeah me for voting at all."

I've lost my social security card and cannot get one online because they actually hit one of the credit agencies and I keep my credit locked for security.  The Social security office doesn't take appointments for this so I have to take a half day vacation to deal with it.

I can deal with it but I can see where it is truly a huge burden for individuals with limited funds, possibly no reliable transportation and where $50 for a certificate (birth, marriage, whatever) is huge.

So, the real problem is that id's are exceedingly difficult to get now and definitely skewed to economic status."

You grew up as part of the majority and I grew up as an outsider to those majority values.  Sounds like we have both been in group prayer situations but trust me when I say the experience is very different for each of us.

I'm not saying that choice is against Christian values - you misunderstood.   I'm saying that group prayers make people feel ostracized.  Why would people with Christian values not value the kind of sensitivity & awareness that they would not want to create situations that make others feel this way?

It's particularly bad in school settings because peer pressure there is extremely powerful.  Notice that Christians have had to fight for years and now are turning to one of the most unethical men ever to get this power back.  That speaks volumes.

I have no problem whatsoever with a brief statement thanking everyone for being at the game, supporting the school, and hope for a night of no injuries as we love our team and our players and wish them the best.  That is a non-denominational version of the same thing.  

On the subject of NEED... Why does the above statement not meet the needs of the situation?  I argue that it does while making everyone feel part of the same community with common goals.  This is a great thing - all feel good and part of the SAME community.

How often do Christians pray?  Is there a specific requirement or guideline?

She was super religious and in a stable relationship but I don't think they were married yet.  They married later and stayed married for a long time.

It is important that these displays occur regularly at football games and other school activities.

Blood sugar is not a static measurement but it sounds like he's treating it that way.  

I guess the same is true of other metrics like cholesterol but not like blood sugar which jump or fall in a few minutes depending upon mostly food but also other factors.

He should have done more to assess the situation."

My major frustration is more with the medical community who seem so disinterested and stuck in the past especially with respect to diet.

Some of our differences might be due to LADA (type 1.5) versus Type2 but I suspect few of us are ever tested unless we demand it.  And, that's medically ok unless a patient is beyond just diet & metformin.

I tried two different endo's (one of those associated with Duke) and both told me that my BG would inevitably rise and that nothing more needed to be done until my A1C was at least 6.5 or higher.  

One of them actually told me to ""go live my life"" and don't worry about it.

Neither showed any interest in helping me fine-tune my program to arrest the BG increases that I was experiencing.  One of them suggested low carb is ""okay"" but whole fresh foods is a better approach.   

Like you, I've learned from trial & error, my CGM, and research but I did manage to stop the increase in my BG no thanks to them."

You are probably losing weight too.  It will take a while longer to see stabilization.

If you can get a continuous glucose monitor, I highly recommend it.  There is just no conceivable way to get data throughout the day & night with individual finger sticks.  Your daily pattern, weekly data, etc. in graph form is immediately available and it just helps you ""stay between the lines"" so much better IMHO."

I don't have the answer but I see so much partisan politics in the process that it is rendered ineffective.  It needs to be non-partisan - at least the trial portion.

Look at the Clinton impeachment for an example.  What he did was very concise & clear so why would there be a partisan split on those votes?    In a perfect process, the votes would be based on arguments based on the perjury itself and whether or not that constitutes high crimes & misdemeanors.  There could be valid disagreements about that.   Instead it was clearly based 100% on ""R"" and ""D"" party designations."

Don't beat yourself up over having previous thoughts that you were going to end up alone.  Those are thoughts that all of us have, particularly at stressful times like having a new mouth to feed, but they are discarded when they don't happen.  And, even if you felt it strongly enough to encourage additional medical screening, it wouldn't have helped.  Medical screenings won't find everything especially if there are no symptoms other than ""a feeling or fear"" from a spouse.  It would have ended with you getting prescribed anti-anxiety meds.
