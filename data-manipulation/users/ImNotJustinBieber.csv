It doesn't.  Implementing a winning strategy is what makes you better at poker. The win-rate simply offers a peek into whether that strategy is a winning strategy or not.  And it's deceptive because if it's not enough hands, it can appear that a player is winning.  

>Why do people keep answering this question by telling be a definition of winrate?

Because you keep asking about it as though you don't know what it is.

Honestly, do whatever you want, man. Believe whatever you want. You have an upswing? Congrats! You're a winning player with a high win rate now. Don't forget to post your chip stack & bank account on instagram"

Start at the fundamentals. Pre-flop.  Work on that first.  What to open raise, call a raise, 3 bet, call a 3 bet, or fold for the most common effective stack sizes and in each position.  Get that down like the back of your hand. Might take a few dozen hours of study, flash cards, memorizing, etc.. You need to be so good at this that it's automatic. That way you can start eventually paying attention to other things like tells, bet sizing, other table dynamics, etc... But until you get it down, all of that is less valuable.

poker,femf4sr,t1_fejpxm2,1579252244.0,"In the US, tipping & customer service culture gives servers the opportunity to generate extra income.  

It has nothing to do with paying an employee a non-livable wage.  

In the US, a server has 2 jobs rolled into one
1. Do what's needed to bring the order  - quality is judged by the employer & paid by the employer
2. Make the customer feel valued and happy that they placed the order at their establishment vs any other place    - quality is judged by the customer & paid by the customer. 

Bringing the order is very straightforward and does not require many special skills to complete. Thus the low wages, just like every other job that does not require many specialized skills.  

Making the customer feel valued and happy that they placed the order here rather than the place across the street requires more skills, social awareness, gauging the customers mood, and general charm, etc... and so customers will tip for that experience.    Servers are not obligated to provide that experience but then they risk not being tipped as well as the servers who do.  Each server has the freedom to choose which strategy they prefer.  That is a win-win as far as freedom of choice is concerned."

It's not for everyone, but if you just like to sit at the tables, play the game, and win against bad players, you might like it.  He tells me the rake is usually pretty high, but the bad players more than make up for it.    The stories he tells me of guys calling him down in huge pots with ridiculous shit are some of the funniest I've ever heard.  He tells me that usually near the end of the cruise, everyone has lost so much money to him that nobody will play if he's still at the table so then he has to actually, you know, do vacation shit with his wife.  Or the other wives will have to come and pull their husbands away from the table while they chase what they lose to him.  Makes me crack up after every cruise he goes on.
