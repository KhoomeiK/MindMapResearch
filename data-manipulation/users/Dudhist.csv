It is not. Tapping into the fluidity of conception in the Eternal Now is how Heaven is achieved, a skill we take with us after life. We learn how to ground Heaven into being by achieving a Tantric unity of Yin/Yang forces within the individual.

This is the water Yeshua asked us to drink....a man who would be ***APPALLED*** to hear you speaking of him as a god.

Limiting yourself to a single theory of religion is limiting your ascension. By forcing a concrete view that your knowledge is greater than others, you close yourself."

An isolated rock.

God is Creation. The quote you brought is meaning that we are made in the image of creation, as creators blessed with that capacity.

But without a mother, there is no conception."

I am telling you that you do not respect the Divine Feminine with your rhetoric, the failure of the church at large which your words are bound to. The lack of understanding of sexual energy stemming from the sexism bound to those ideas is a hindrance to progress upon divinity."

When you realize how precious each moment can be because of its potential, then you will never be bored again."
alchemy,ffriuan,t3_ethh17,1580158883.0,"Your views are hyper-Catholic, and being rigid to them is a disservice to yourself.

When you deify Yeshua instead of learning his words, there is a barrier that prevents the sexual transmutation of the water he asked us to drink. 

When you view God in the masculine terms, it neglects the Unity of the Duality that we participate in for the conception of Trinity. 

Kristos is more than a title *given* to Yeshua, it's a force of nature that is to be tapped and transmuted within the being. This is Alchemy."

I was working 6 days a week before my hours got knocked down to 3-4 days a week. My manager was getting pissed that stuff wasn't getting done as effectively as it had been before....and blaming it on me, when I'm working half the hours and he's giving the other half to kids that don't give a crap.

Being a part timer, I decided to quit 2 days before his honeymoon. Being the most effective employee, he was not happy at all.

The kicker is that he was marrying my aunt."

Blessings are so much more than mere words. Alchemy is understanding the Aetheric connection we contain, and how to influence it with pointed awareness that is grounded in the Heavenly Virtues, so that we can achieve Kristos in ourselves. 

The more time we spend grovelling over the ideas of God, Jesus, and Heaven, the less time we can spend emulating them."
alchemy,ffqtr57,t1_ffq07xx,1580143447.0,"Yeshua Kristos was an Ascended Master and a Master Alchemist. He was grounded in humility, washed the feet of prostitutes, and did not want reverence.

Your views are incredibly Catholic. God is not masculine, God is union and constant. There is no ""only way"", but that is the overbearing hierarchy of un-awakened religion that served to separate people from their spirit.

Yeshua knew how to invoke the Holy Spirit, but he never claimed to be above anybody. That would have gone against the entirety of his teachings, which was trying to help people get to where he was. He wanted people to emulate him, not put him on a pedestal and hold him above.

Jesus wasn't a Christian, he was a Buddha who studied Hinduism during his time in India, before returning it to intermingle with the Jewish faith. He had achieved Gnosis.

The concrete nature of your views goes against his teachings."
