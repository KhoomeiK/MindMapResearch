todayilearned,ffq33m6,t1_ffpn52u,1580117749.0,"since you seem to know about it, I have a question, I can hear my neighbours, they have an alzheimer grandma, and they talk to her like a baby, with high pitched voice or nosense babling, sometimes they ask her random questions trying to get her to answer with ""yes"" or ""no"", like ""is it cold, yes or no?"", calling her by her name and repeating the question multiple times until they get an answer and I hear grandma struggling to answer, sometimes getting frustrated and shouting scared.

I'm sure they are doing their best, handling an alzheimers patient seems really hard, but I'm curious, Is it better trying to interact with alzheimers patient with random interactions like those, knowing that it can make them confused? or just leaving them on their own and not talk to them until they try to leave the house or do something dangerous?"

I don't think so, videogames are becoming more and more exensive with DLC and F2P microtransactions on paid games, even tough there's way more buyers than ever because gaming is popular now, companies want money and prices aren't based on how much a thing worth to make vs how much profit is estimated, but how much customers are willing to pay"
