heroscape,ffbepgj,t3_esonnp,1579762083.0,Interesting quirky special attack.
heroscape,ffavle0,t1_ffavdma,1579745511.0,"I want to come up with a method that used a more reasonable amount of pieces, quantities that the average person would own, and release them as playable boards. Printable stat cards for players and mobs and glyphs! Something that can have expansions or bolt in style to combine people’s sets without mixing pieces."
heroscape,ffaut30,t1_ffaujug,1579744990.0,"I’m really excited/anxious about how it’s going to play out. I’ve made an easy and hard difficulty for both the player stats and the monster stats so you can choose your level of adventure! 

Looking for people that want to play so if you are near Houston TX, let me know!"
heroscape,ff95epu,t3_ek7g94,1579705256.0,Still love this effect!
heroscape,ff76ix9,t1_ff6seoh,1579642095.0,"Appreciate that. Well if you don’t take into account the 15 dungeon set rock outcrops or the 30+ tree sets... the terrain isn’t too bad. Most of it is 24hex just laid out with the 3,2,1hex randomized on top of it. Maybe a little over $1,000 for the terrain, another $1,000 for the bulk filler. The trees and rock outcrops $3,000 maybe."
heroscape,ff56cer,t1_ff4hcdz,1579581491.0,Perfect use of the trees! I love the lava on the outside forcing players to have a reason to move inward.
heroscape,ff568rk,t1_ff54c6n,1579581406.0,"You know what, I’ve never actually signed up on heroscapers :/"
heroscape,ff4x50s,t1_ff4vw5b,1579574561.0,"Yeah, I used some logical reasoning and basic rules to govern the map and restrictions. Balancing the values for health, attack, defense was the hardest part along with spacing out the proper health glyphs."
heroscape,ff4wof7,t1_ff4vavy,1579574245.0,I appreciate the kind words
heroscape,ff4ovkk,t1_ff4oiab,1579568881.0,"I didn’t want to feel held back when I build, sometimes I run almost dry (like with the trees here I used all but like 10 of each size). I used between 1/4 and 1/3 of my inventory on this. It’s very spread out with maybe 3 stacks high. The upper level is a bunch of grass 24hex stacked and then smaller pieces on just the surface.  There are some tricks to make elevations without a solid mass if you’re limited terrain if you have a castle set."
heroscape,ff46h0r,t3_ergyj1,1579556591.0,Please god no more Heroscape that I’ll have to inevitably buy! Ha
heroscape,ff3hhud,t1_ff3hbqe,1579541140.0,I may be reaching out if I run into scenarios that I can’t figure out ;)
