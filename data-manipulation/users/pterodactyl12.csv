I volunteered for a couple years teaching English to immigrants in America before I moved her so I knew the basics but I’ve learned a lot since then. 

There are plenty of people who move here to teach and don’t know what an adverb is. They do fine.

It’s a decent gig. About 2k take home plus free living conditions and food and shit is cheap. Can save about $1k a month easy. If you wanna hustle and work illegally then sky is the limit.
