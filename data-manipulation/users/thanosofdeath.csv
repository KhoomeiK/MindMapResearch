AskAsexual,ffamvxg,t1_ffaa5pk,1579739685.0,"I've heard the subject of alterous attraction called a mesh, because the personalities mesh.

But yeah! I have had maybe 3-5 squishes/meshes over the past 5 years or so. Only one has panned out into being a truly meaningful relationship though, but that's fine by me! :)"
AskAsexual,ffamqz2,t3_esky1e,1579739589.0,"Masturbation is mostly mechanical. It feels ok, but it's not a necessity. Sometimes it's nice to crank one out before bed, as I usually get kinda sleepy after. I'm more likely to think about the emotions involved in intimacy than anything, and even then, it's somewhat rare."
AskAsexual,ffa97vl,t1_ffa07dz,1579730345.0,"Really the only feeling I have gotten is alterous attraction when I first begin to meet someone (only happened a few times.) It feels a bit like a crush but it's really yhis very strong desire to establish an extremely close platonic relationship. It's what happened with my queerplatonic partner, and I guess I just want more relationships like I have with her, that's all."
AskAsexual,ff9zswr,t1_ff9sl1q,1579725000.0,"I might be demiromantic as well. Almost everyone looks meh to me. What has happened a few times though is that the better I get to know someone, the more aesthetically pleasing they are to me. Still not sexually attractive, but still."
