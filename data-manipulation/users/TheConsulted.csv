Music,femm01a,t1_femkm03,1579262019.0,If this was your response before it blew up then your point is valid (and that might totally be the case) but so many times it's *because* something gets popular that all of the sudden all the hot takes come out about how dumb/bad etc. something is. Happens every time.

oddlyspecific,fef99sl,t1_feetfjw,1579051200.0,"This is totally missing the fact that wealth stratification and cost of living have gone insane since our grandparents were in those factories. 40 hours in the 70s *absolutely* provided a higher standard of living compared to now.
  
Yes people are sedentary, yes that leads to lowered energy and a nasty cycle. No people aren't just lazy, they're dealing with a ton of variables prior generations haven't had to. I'd wager those psychological factors are just as impactful."
TwoXChromosomes,fee3zkr,t3_eoip7f,1579025918.0,"I'm sorry you had this experience. Those guys are dumb and need to take responsibility for being intelligent creatures and not just a set of dick and balls that can't control themselves. For what it's worth, I'm a dude whose best mentor EVER, BY FAR, was a woman who kicked insane amounts of ass at my company and still to this day I respect most out of any professional I've met. 
  
Somewhat on the same topic, I had a conversation with my wife awhile ago that made me think a lot about it this sort of thing. We were playing with our dogs at a local high school (nice big soccer fields for throwing the frisbee) and on the drive out I winced at some huge posters hanging on the Tennis courts of individual highschool-aged girls in, what *I* would consider teensy tiny black spandex shorts. 

My wife sees me wince and says, ""That's *your* problem for sexualizing them. That's on you."" and I still think about it to this day. It made me feel like a huge creep. I think what gets me is, if the school put them in tiny bikinis up there, I think my reaction would be be considered ""justifiable""? If not that, what about if they were naked? How do we decide where that line is? Is there a line? This is of course hyperbole, but it's a sort of interesting thought exercise I've been turning over in my head a lot because, you know, I don't want to be a creep. Is it *ever* ""understandable"" for someone to be sexualized? We sell sex constantly, so it's certainly happening in some forms? It all seems really tied up in cultural norms, evolutionary biology etc. 
  
I don't have an answer, but it's made me WAY more aware of that sort of reaction."

ABoringDystopia,fc66z5p,t1_fc5z3ml,1577473697.0,"If they're a decent company they're doing it proactively. It's not just a nice thing to do it's the smart thing to do. Having an employee turnover after a few months is HUGELY costly. 
  
If they're not giving you that info you have a couple of options depending on the situation. If you're talking to someone who is in the role you are applying for, wait for the end when they inevitably ask if you have questions and ask what the best part of the job is. After that ask what their least favorite part of the job is. It flows much easier when you ask both. If you're talking to an HR person ask the same questions but about culture instead of the role. But again, most decent companies are doing this proactively."
ABoringDystopia,fc5il50,t1_fc5hzr4,1577458593.0,"Yeah they suck too. A huge emphasis for me is what they call a ""RJP"" or realistic job preview. I have zero interest tricking someone into a job they don't really want. That's just short-sighted stupidity and unnecessary headaches all around."
