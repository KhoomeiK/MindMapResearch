TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffcck84,t3_esk1xe,1579796524.0,I’m sorry. If I have to come in to pick up my check so help me you’d better physically be there. If you aren’t or are trying to withhold my check I’m calling the sheriff to pick it up for me.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ff8684o,t3_eqp0nt,1579667135.0,Seriously. I’ve had a dark sense of humor. But this is going too far. I keep it to teasing myself and video games.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,feezt6b,t1_fe6qxdr,1579044856.0,You can love your work but have 4-5 people you don’t like dealing with. No job will fit someone 100% as there will always be other humans in this world. If they’re happy with the rest of it then they’re fine where they are.

I’ve noticed extra charges to my account happen, too. Some that I was supposed to get.



But I wouldn’t freak out if the candy bar I wanted was a few cents more. That’s nuts. (Was it a nutty bar, lol?)"

TalesFromRetail,fdjwqq6,t1_fdjt8xn,1578489967.0,It’s the lack of care for another human. That’s why. She was hurt and on the floor. Stepping over someone and ignoring their situation shows lack of empathy on your part.

TalesFromRetail,fdb4q3s,t3_eicxsd,1578253791.0,"I’ve spoken up before to help a retail employee out. But it was in a situation that I knew that the employee couldn’t help with.


I was in a big blue store just looking for some compressed air when I hear a woman ask a man (at least 60) about the differences between an Xbox One S and Xbox One X.


Poor guy looked so baffled. The silence was getting awkward...I found myself kinda saying them out loud while the lady listened intently. Not trying to push him out of the way but more in a way I was still looking at stuff.


When I turned the lady asked if I worked there. I told her no, I worked at a video game store. The look on the old man’s face was one of pure relief that someone else knew what it was.




Of course, while I did that to help an old man who was genuinely confused, I could never dream of doing that to a person who is very well-informed and answering the questions just fine."

TalesFromRetail,fd2at93,t1_fd1xaio,1578144437.0,"Used to work at a movie theater. Food there is incredibly expensive, as all are.


Brother worked in fast food. So I was picking up food at my brother’s work when going to check up on him.


His manager jokingly said double the price and I was about to pay when my brother stopped me and said, “You really gonna pay that?”



I looked and made certain it was actually my order’s price. Thankfully, it was. But my brain was wired from working at a place that was so high I didn’t flinch.



Of course, I don’t think that would’ve been the case here."
TalesFromRetail,fd2ab1z,t3_ejo89d,1578144191.0,Had an old manager who would hand out application forms to people when they did that. It was great seeing their expressions when they were essentially being asked to prove it.
TalesFromRetail,fd2a2he,t3_ejolhv,1578144070.0,"I’ve made exceptions at work, too. Of course it depends on the person, how nice you’ve been to me and what’s up with the item you’re returning.



Buyer’s remorse because you regret purchasing something? Changed your story four times and have lied about the item? Now trying to bully me into the return? Nope! You’re stuck with it!

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fczdu9n,t1_fcyqaux,1578098967.0,Burger King is mentioned. Also OP’s SO said they have a job. Sounds like they blew their money on it and they charge it in fast food places. Since you can buy something for a dollar and then sit at a table to charge your electronics. Being considered a ‘paying customer’.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fcz8sd9,t3_ej8b2v,1578095973.0,"You know, it’s really funny.


These ‘influencers’ that come by and try to throw their weight around really prove the point that their opinion wouldn’t make a lick of difference.


Let’s pretend that my YouTube channel suddenly blew up. Suddenly I’m a big name in hotel reviews with a bunch of fans following me.


It would be in MY best interest to make certain that as FEW people as possible knew who I was or when I was staying.


Why?


Because a GOOD review comes from the angle of people who only care about reviewing it as a NORMAL GUEST. Not as a celebrity.


So feeding these people gives their fans an expectation that’ll hurt the hotel more than anything and show them as a fraud. People don’t wanna stay with a hotel that lied to them.

Was it the child’s fault for standing, doing absolutely nothing wrong that they should be struck? No.



People need to be held accountable for every action that they make. It’s no one else’s fault they got drunk. Giving them a pass for it because they’re rich makes it worse, since they’ll continue to butter you up at the hotel and then be abusive drunks somewhere else."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fcfyqdp,t3_egx3yt,1577634930.0,"Once at a theater I worked at a snack company that was buying ad space sent us a box of their snacks to pass out. We did for a bit.


I found the note they had left in the box essentially telling us to be their salespeople. Talk about how great the snacks were before handing them out and tell them to “Purchase snacks at your local retailer!”



I am collecting one paycheck. Maybe I’m petty since I didn’t even like my job there. But yes, they’ve bought ad space. But we didn’t ask for samples. And in my mind, you’re already hurting the concessions sales by giving out a free snack to guests in the movie theater."
