movies,ff7j71w,t1_ff7igns,1579650809.0,"Nope. Radiohead have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. 12 million are only digital. They are clearly more famous and more importantly a lot more respected. Multiple awards. It’ll be a thousand years before SM would even be considered for the accolades Radiohead have won. 

30 million albums. Ok Computer, regarded amongst people with fully functional frontal lobes (humans) consider this album to be the greatest album of all time has sold 6.5 million times alone. 

Sam Smith is a popstar, trained to do and say pop star things. Deliberately not acknowledging a fellow artist, a very well known artist is weak and only shows his own deep insecurities. If I ever meet him which is likely considering I have won the mercury prize, an Ivor novella, been nominated for 3 Brit Awards, one Grammy, won multiple NME awards myself, I’ll tell him to fuck off on behalf of Thom Yorke.

Regular guy on the street yes, I wouldn’t be surprised if they hadn’t heard of Radiohead, that makes sense. Radiohead wrote a theme song to the same film Sam Smith did, they were both in the running for the job, did he not know that? 

Sam Smith has also plagiarised Radiohead in the past. If I sound “douchey” to you for trying to make a point then I’m glad. 

Also I’m a human being and I know when someone is lying due to insecurity."
