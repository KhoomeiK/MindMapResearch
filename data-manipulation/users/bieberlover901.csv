AskMechanics,ffp9629,t1_ffp8gd1,1580089297.0,Does your car not have a tire change kit?  I have never seen a lug wrench that small.  You might be able to borrow a breaker bar from an auto parts store but I doubt they would do it for you.
AskMechanics,ffp5e5e,t3_eufibm,1580086677.0,Did you get the key that goes with the lock?  Do you know how to change your tire if you get a flat?   Why would you need someone to install them?
NoStupidQuestions,ffp4eiv,t3_eug1tf,1580085963.0,"I have noticed in slow motion videos of them sprinting one paw is ahead of the other, kind of like a horse as opposed to a rabbit."
WWIIplanes,ffp45oq,t3_euaokk,1580085784.0,"Just a reminder that their cartoonishly large kill counts were because for most of the war they were attacking unescorted, slow moving bombers that weren't even permitted to take evasive action."

I don't know anything about you but going to an Academy and enlisting are two fundamentally different life tracks.  Also the Academies are some of the most selective schools in the country, like Harvard selective."

NoStupidQuestions,ffn2arp,t3_eu9kx2,1580061217.0,"The reason it's slower is because the money goes from you, to the sending bank, from them it goes (electronically)  to the Fed, the Fed then gives it to the receiving bank who then gives it to your friend.  All of these transactions may be processed at COB or even midnight, so you get a lot of lag time even if no one step should have taken that long.  When you use an app you give the money to the app and they give it to your friend."
askcarguys,ffmx9g2,t3_eu6vfa,1580059824.0,I think much of it comes from threatened industry insiders such as other auto companies and especially from dealers.  I doubt anyone outside the industry has much of an opinion one way or the other.

Also despite what the Godfather and other movies that mythologize them, they always have been involved with the drugs trade.  One of the funnier/sadder and realistic scenes in a mob movie is when Donnie Brasco is in the early days of joining the gang,  he's in their club and Lefty is breaking open parking meters with a hammer to steal the change."

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffhlpn3,t1_ffhlfbu,1579941223.0,"Read a thing a while ago that unfortunately struck a bit close to home.  Basically a survey of doctors found that if they were diagnosed with cancer \~65+ they would *not* undergo chemo, because there is no fucking point.  All you get is a few more of the most miserable years of your life.  I don't know what it's like where you live but in the US doctors basically torture old people for the last few years of their lives because Medicare pays for it and culturally we can't seem to admit that death is inevitable."

But I will say that some portion of the statistic that older white men make up the bulk of suicides is because they are taking care of their responsibilities.

Whether or not you drove it the oil would be pretty clean after only 5 weeks, it should look like it came out of the bottle.   That being said, not changing the oil would not be responsible for the car not starting.  *That* being said, if the shop would lie about something as small as an oil change I would be worried about them deliberately messing with the car.

NoStupidQuestions,feu2n6z,t3_eqmcqe,1579382538.0,"The president is not voted for by the people, he is voted on by the Electoral College.  The people vote for electors.  The number of votes that a state gets is the same as their congressional representation.  Wyoming has 1 representative and 2 senators, so they get 3 electors, California has 53 reps and 2 sens, so they get 55 electors.  The electors are usually winner take all from a given state, i.e. if Trump gets 50.01% of the vote in Wisconsin he gets all 10 (8+2) electors, hence the US only has 2 viable political parties.

All that is background info to your question.  Each party has primaries to decide who their nominee should be.  If there is an incumbent that party usually just goes with their guy, with a few rare exceptions, such as Reagan challenging Ford in 1976.  Considering how much the Republican establishment disliked him in 2016 I am a little surprised that nobody has come forward to challenge Trump."
