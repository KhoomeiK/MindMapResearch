AskReddit,fgmgn0e,t3_ez7kki,1580924152.0,As a 3rd class passenger I don’t think you’d get access to anyone or anything that could help. You’d probably have to go full pirate mode and try and get a band of heavies together to attempt a takeover.
offmychest,fgmfxyv,t3_ez7s4q,1580923743.0,Wow!  He is one lucky dude to have such a thoughtful partner. If my “partner” did any of that I’d assume she poisoned my smoothie.
awfuleverything,fghx5po,t3_eyfgr5,1580796646.0,I loved school lunch as a kid and made friends with all the lunch ladies. They’d give me extra milk and large portions because they knew how much I looked forward to their meals. I feel bad that kids don’t get good meals at school.  I wonder what happened...

LifeProTips,fg2y4ec,t1_fg0um45,1580461126.0,This makes me want to dress up as a lady and request a Lyft so I could beat the shit out a predator.
LifeProTips,fg2xtqj,t1_fg0x722,1580460715.0,It was rude of him to ask. I’m a guy and would never put someone in that position. Neither would anyone I know so he was either a potential problem or a fool.

AskReddit,ffisv9h,t3_etvii5,1579981870.0,Driving without a license (I had one but forgot it at home). Anyway the police officer stopped me for speeding but gave me a ticket for “no license”. I was very upset bc I was 16 and afraid of the police. Well I have to go to court and the judge asks me what I was stopped for. I tell him speeding. He says since I didn’t get a ticket for what I was actually stopped for then this one doesn’t count. They just let me off.  It was a great day!!!

AskReddit,felhp11,t3_epkaux,1579222426.0,"I found an envelope with $300.00 lying on the ground next to a car in a handicap spot. A police officer was close by and said he knew the person and would return it to them. Long story short, he pocketed the money and had no intention of returning it. I ended seeing an old couple getting into the car and I asked if they got their money back. We confronted the cop and they got their money. I always thought I could trust the police...it was a dark day for me..."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fdqravv,t1_fdq3z0x,1578673195.0,Ha!  That just reminded me of another weird cat experience. When I was about 15 I was sleeping at my friends house and I woke up in the middle of the night and his cat (Sweet Pea; who didn’t like me) was sleeping on my head. Every time I tried to move Sweet Pea would dig her claws into my head.  All I could do was quietly say “help”!!!!  No one came and I just laid there until morning and she finally got up. She totally made me her bitch....
