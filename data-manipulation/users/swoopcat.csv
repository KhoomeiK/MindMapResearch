depression,ffb81qx,t3_esiopv,1579754531.0,OMG yes. This.
depression,ffaagv4,t1_ff9e9hn,1579731059.0,"Coward is exactly the right word. To have such a cruel impulse, but to be such a small, cowardly person that the only way you can deal with it is by finding a stranger who's been brave enough to make themselves vulnerable, and hiding behind a username so you can hurt them without facing any consequences.

u/Realsadgirl, this is just an utterly pathetic person not fit to lick the bottoms of your shoes."

aww,fenucel,t1_felcc6h,1579290879.0,"It does? Why I no get no sound and no mute switch.

Anyway, doesn't matter. Was a stupid joke that got the upvotes it deserved. (Tho I was genuinely a little curious what it sounded like.)"
news,fenu26m,t1_femx9j8,1579290709.0,"The guy who does the Ask the Pilot blog (and who had to go through security all the time when he was flying) said that once after he got through security he was taking his little mini bottles and putting them into his toiletries bag, and a TSA agent ran over to tell him that he couldn't do that, that they had to be in the clear plastic bag. He tried to explain that no, that was just so that they could be inspected, but the TSA guy wouldn't accept that.

He had another great story where he always took some silverware along for lunch or dinner or whatever, and they confiscated his dull little butter knife. and he's standing there and his pilot uniform thinking, you know, if I wanted to crash the plane, I don't really need the butter knife, in that I'm the one physically steering..."

All of it's absurd, but that's the absurdity at it's finest."
aww,fekx23l,t1_fekuw1b,1579209378.0,"Aw, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault--could'vr happen to anyone. But I understand how horribly guilty it would make you feel."

Ingress,feka8dp,t3_epe1cg,1579195837.0,"I just can't get into prime. The interface is so dark, the colors and don't pop, and the weird amation doesn't give me that great win feeling I used to get when I make a big Field.

I'm just 6 million away from level 16, but it's just not that fun to play anymore, so I think I'll end up quitting before I get there. Crazy how much difference the user interface can make."

It's hard. No way around it, it really is. But there are moments amidst all the loneliness and all the shit that are good. And there are beautiful things sometimes. And that's why my dad, lonely ass is still here, I guess."

It's not about faffing about talking about poetry painting (not that I'm against that), it's about being able to make an argument and support it with evidence, and evaluate the validity of other people's arguments. Instead of, y'know, just pointing and yelling ""Fake news!"""

depression,fedvitk,t3_eojiuf,1579020781.0,"Absolutely, me too. I read a good suggestion once, that said if you notice you're stressing about this kind of thing, give yourself 7 seconds to think about it and then move on. The idea being, it probably wasn't awkward or bad like you're thinking. And even if it were, you couldnt do anything now anyway. So give yourself 7 seconds to process it and feel the anxiety, then move on to the next thing.

(I'll have to see if I can find that article. Was pretty helpful.)"
TwoXChromosomes,fedv2q5,t1_fedusrh,1579020516.0,"If it were literally about people's ability to focus, you'd need to throw gay and pan men in there too. But in the same way, they don't even exist in terms of traditional gender roles, so trying to control other people's wardrobes in order not to distract them had never been an issue."
TwoXChromosomes,fedusrh,t1_fedkfl7,1579020348.0,"It is a broad generalization, yes. But it's also true that I've never heard of anyone (school boards, employers, etc.) making that comment about men.

I see that comment less as a sexist comment about women being genetically more able to focus and more about our cultural conditioning and how women are expected to be more in control of their sexuality--or more like, aren't considered to even have a sexual drive--than men."

television,fdp5nn9,t1_fdf21zy,1578620573.0,"That's a fair point. Watching it from this perspective--with a realistic understanding of all the issues operating in the background-h makes more sense to me. Still not my thing, but I get why it could be entertaining."
tifu,fdf9xwi,t1_fdeyqdb,1578356743.0,That's a really good point.
television,fdf0mlg,t1_fdesqno,1578350628.0,The issue is that they're not really the best artistic works. Movies and TV shows campaign by sending academy or guild members incredibly expensive gifts. How many Best Picture winners were really the best movie of that year?

I was at a store and a lady said, if you need anything, I'm Denise. And I thought, that's amazing. I'd never heard a conditional name before. What's your name if I don't need anything?"
