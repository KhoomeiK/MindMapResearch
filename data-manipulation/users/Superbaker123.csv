Advice,fd3aayv,t1_fd39ejp,1578156309.0,"No, you're misunderstanding. There isn't anything wrong with watching female streamers, it's the ones that serve their bodies up on a platter where the sole purpose is to enjoy the fan service.

Advice,fd373yl,t1_fd36c0z,1578155318.0,All she did was say it didn't make her feel comfortable and would feel better if he didn't watch it.

Advice,fd35ytg,t1_fd34snt,1578155068.0,"From the post it doesnt say there are other streamers, just this specific girl. If he really only cared about the gameplay, then he wouldnt have gotten angry when she brought it up and just changed streamers. Anger in these situations are usually a quick indicator of a guilty conscience."
Advice,fd35fmh,t1_fd2m33h,1578154882.0,"Nice way to disregard everything she said and somehow turn the blame on her. There are so many things wrong with this comment. First of all, you're excusing his behavior because he could be doing something worse. Then, you're actually suggesting that she tries to compete with these strangers for her boyfriend's affection. And to top it all of, she's a ""jealous bitch"" for not being comfortable with her boyfriend oogling scantily dressed women and opening up about it. Holy shit, please do not get into a relationship."

Now, I think a good place to start is getting to know yourself. What do you like to do? What do you think is important? Selfcare is going to be so crucial to this recovery process, and it will help you love yourself. 

As for not knowing what you want to do with your life, this is 100% normal. From other comments I've read, you're turning 16 and I'm gonna be honest. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AT THIS AGE. All of the other people you see that you think have it all together absolutely do not. They are just as clueless as you are, so you are not behind and there is nothing wrong with you. Life can take us all different ways, and sometimes we just need to relax and go with it.

I think it is also important for you to know how proud I am of you, and if you ever feel yourself backsliding into that hole DM me or someone you trust. Today may not be great, so live for tomorrow. That breakthrough could be just around the corner."

The main highway was at a standstill while we were on our way to a part of Colorado that I can't remember the name of, so we took the exit indicating a detour. From what I remember, the weather was fine and we were on our merry way. The road soon took us into the mountains and I distinctly remember there not being a guardrail along the road, despite the huge dropoff. Next thing I remember is it snowing harder than I had ever seen before, and cars were at a standstill. Our car began sliding toward the edge and somehow caught traction just in time.

So if you're ever in Colorado and you see a detour taking you to the 6, stay the fuck away."
