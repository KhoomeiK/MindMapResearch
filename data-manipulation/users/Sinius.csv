I'll give you that one, Light's Hope isn't somewhere he could win (although we have a lore instance where Kel'thuzad almost won Light's Hope, and failed only due to Mograine's sacrifice). 
 
> And he had Death Knights with him 
 
The Acherus Death Knights were all meant to die at Light's Hope. Arthas knew this. He wanted to draw out Tirion so he could kill him. The plan failed because of Ashbringer, but this is what ruined his hero plan in the end: Tirion being alive.  
  
> Almost killed in his own turf by the Blight Bombs  
 
He didn't expect that, that's true. However, Wrathgate was a victory for the Scourge: Alliance and Horde failed to open another front on Icecrown and nothing of value to the Scourge was lost. Lich King survived. He would've won even if the Blight hadn't killed the attacking army.  
 
> He tries to invade, we see him coming a mile away and bomb the shit out of him.  
 
And he simply resurrects all of his lost troops and adds some to his army with the people he kills along the way. Warcraft 3 campaign demonstrates how truly unstoppable the Scourge is, WotLK Scourge is potentially even stronger.

I think I get my sidequest urges from Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.

But when you're traveling around and come across two strangers pleading for a ""god"" to lower his tithes, you'll feel like you want to investigate.
