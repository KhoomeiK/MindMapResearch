aww,fdfh5dv,t1_fdf310l,1578361579.0,I see a squirrel go through walnut and brazillian nut in no time.  I give him the brazillian nut thinking that it would take him at least 2 to 5 minute to chew.  Nope less than 30 sec !

space,fd9vitt,t3_ekcg0e,1578238547.0,There is also the possibility that life elsewhere have done the same thing as mankind on earth... destroy themselves in a few thousand years.  On space time a few thousand years is like a flicker of light.

aww,fc8c8dh,t3_egm4ls,1577531646.0,"My cat did something like that once.  He's a big couch potato.  Rarely goes farther than my immediate neighbor backyard.  One day,  in autumn he didnt came back.  We search for him every day.  We worried if he was cold, scared or hungry.  By the end of the week we were almost sure to never see him again.  

One night i was sleeping and i was almost sure that i heard his meow.  I go check and he was at the door.  Scared and hungry, but ok.

Since that day, three years ago,  he never wanted to go back outside alone again."
