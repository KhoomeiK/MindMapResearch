worldnews,ff8vmj1,t1_ff8gccm,1579697607.0,"PET bottles become new PET bottles, if they even melt them, the bigger bottles they just wash and reuse.

But plastic does indeed degrade the more times it's reused. So new bottles cannot be made of 100% reused bottles over and over infinitely, but it's not as bad as you say that it's only a few times, it can be used at least 10 times as a bottle before it's becoming a plastic bag (or whatever is next)."

There is a degradation in quality though (while metal can be reused to infinity), I think they say they can only reuse it about 10-20 times or something. Not sure how they keep count though, maybe what that means is they need to add 5-10% new plastic each time.


(For example in Germany and the Scandinavian countries plastic bottles from soda is all recycled, either melted and remodeled or even washed and reused, there is a deposit you pay when you buy the bottle that you get back if you return it.

But what's really needed is that the legislation forces people to take their responsibility, the leaders can't just sit and hope the people do the right thing.

In the case of single use plastic, Germany and the Scandinavian countries (and possibly more?) have had a system for at least 20 years that adds a deposit to the price when you buy plastic bottles (either reusable bottles or single use but recyclable), which you get back if you return the bottle. I think some US states have this system for metal cans, but not plastic (IIRC from a Seinfeldt episode).
