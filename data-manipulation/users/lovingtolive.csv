depression,ffbtk2y,t3_esrgcj,1579782233.0,I just started on Wellbutrin a month ago. It’s supposed to increase sex drive and help depression. No change so far though.
ForeverAlone,ff7zi5v,t3_eru8xz,1579662094.0,"Same problem here although I’m 22. For a brief period when I was 19 I dated a girl and had my first kiss , lost my virginity and everything. Now 3 years later that feels like a completely different world. I feel like I’m 40 years old already. I also am not ugly although I am short and very bad at social interactions ( don’t have any friends ).  I also relate to being asexual - I’ve been trying to figure out my sexuality for years and I just get more confused. I masturbate and feel some attraction to others however I don’t have a strong drive to seek out sex. This also contributes to my anxiety because I can’t maintain a good erection for sex so even on the off chance someone wanted a relationship with me it would be doomed to fail."
shortcels,ff7y098,t3_es4mle,1579661047.0,Death is the only cope. No matter how ugly or chad maxxed you are inevitable aging and death will come and soon life will collapse into nothingness.
shortcels,ff7w0pq,t3_eruulx,1579659693.0,His hair plays a big role. Thick NW1 black hair combined with strong prominent facial features and height. He’s definitely not ugly- slightly large nose sure but in no way ugly.

ForeverAlone,femohz5,t3_epr003,1579264752.0,I’m not ugly although I am a short male so that lowers my rating potential. But the main thing is my personality. I simply cannot connect with others to form friendships or relationships.
IncelsWithoutHate,fegemlf,t1_fegdm7i,1579090104.0,Just alphamaxx. Unless your below 4/10 facially you’ll be good.
IncelsWithoutHate,fegdl80,t3_eowyvn,1579088932.0,Anyone above 5”9 is a fakecel
depression,fegdh6y,t3_eoxun3,1579088802.0,When I’m depressed I welcome misery therefore I have nothing to feel anxious about. I struggle with both depression and anxiety so I pretty much have to chose which one I want to feel. If I start feeling hopeful I get super anxious of what can go wrong. If I feel depressed I just accept life is shit and don’t have to worry about anything. So yes it’s comforting.
IncelsWithoutHate,fegcw6e,t1_febxpt5,1579088100.0,Drugs is a good cope I feel like. Even when I’m feeling absolutely shit about life I’m like “ well at least someday I’ll get to try physcdelics” I know they probably aren’t even that great but it’s something to look forward to.
shortcels,fed87fy,t1_fec6ag3,1579003311.0,Height doesn’t matter to gay men
ForeverAlone,fed7qx4,t3_eoar20,1579002775.0,"I have a really bad baby face to and I’m also 5”6. Yea man it’s rough. On the one hand at least we aren’t “ugly” to girls but instead we are just not attractive even though we aren’t ugly. I still think being ugly would be worse cause even with a baby face we aren’t really seen as creepy. As long as we don’t go bald ( I’m taking propecia).

But it sucks getting mistaken for a highschool kid all the time. I’m sure eventually I’ll look older but even then I’ll still be 5”6. Never feel like a man."
IncelsWithoutHate,febny1e,t3_eobzl8,1578960876.0,I feel the same. Seeing guys to is depressing af because there’s many chads. Or at least most people have friends .
depression,fdsgy1u,t1_fdrqo5r,1578702530.0,And here I am thinking I am wasting “the best years of my life “ ( early 20s). Well this comment is inspiring haha
shortcels,fbxtuw3,t3_eeuend,1577200363.0,Try propecia. I have the same problem but I got on propecia 3 years ago and it maintained my diffusing
