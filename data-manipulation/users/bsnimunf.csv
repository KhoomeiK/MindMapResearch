Documentaries,ff6bz39,t3_erui1u,1579623867.0,"I remember these women hanging around outside the Liverpool student union on Monday and Saturday nights which were the two big student events at Liverpool uni, time tunnel and double vision if I remember correctly. 

They used to hang round hoping to pick up drunk students, hard to see any one actually wanting their services as they looked so sick and abused although I imagine they made a lot more money given due to sympathy rather than for prostitution. I know I probably gave them more than four quid on numerous occasions. Always feel a little guilty that I probably fed an addiction  and made their situation worse in the long term.

One night I left early because I downed a ridiculous amount of spirits and realised I was going to struggle to get home if I didn't leave before the alcohol kicked in. When I got outside alot of these women surrounded me and even though I was stupidly drunk and struggling to stand I realised things probably weren't going to end well for my possessions if I stuck around. Fortunately I had a pocket full of change, probably about twenty quid so I pulled it all out and instead of given it them I ""accidentally"" dropped it all over the place. That kept them distracted long enough for me to swiftly stumble off round the corner onto a busier road."

There were many times when i needed to move over to take an exit saw a nice big gap indicated to move over then the person in the other lane would aggressively close the gap deliberately so i couldn't use it.  This type of thing also happens in the UK also but in the states it seemed to be the norm rather than a rare occurrence.  It was almost like they perceived it as you insulting them.   Another example is when traffic joins a busy highway in the UK we would move over to give the new traffic more room to join the highway safely. In the states people seemed to deliberately try and close the gaps so you cant get on the highway.
