AskReddit,ffgsykj,t1_fff1soy,1579914264.0,Best 5 minutes I've wasted on reddit ever.
portfolios,ffg3ekn,t3_etddgy,1579897602.0,I started with a target date fund with about the same amount to invest. It does the thinking for you. It wasn't until i got a lot more invested and did a ton more research that I settled on a 3 fund portfolio. There is a lot of good info here in the sidebar as well.
running,ff7xhxf,t3_eryzsb,1579660694.0,"I live in Phoenix so it's pretty much the only way I can run in the summer. My trick: watch soccer if at all possible. You're running, their running, and you can get up to 45 minutes straight no commercials."
widowers,fevo84c,t3_eqmhai,1579399637.0,Her pillows still get made and put on the bed after 1y4m out. I still fold the towels the way she wanted after winning that fight. Things do seem to make more sense eventually. Stay strong. Do you!
facepalm,fevd1mq,t3_eqm32w,1579395935.0,"Happened to me once, but it was a little old lady. I really wanted to make a snide comment but couldn't bring myself to it. She said she was going to call a tow truck and i was like... yea have fun paying them to tow your car out parked over the lines."
widowers,fehuu47,t3_ep70sz,1579124312.0,"I come less and less as time goes on. It has helped me though and I'll try to respond to certain threads. It's nice to have a place where everyone can empathize.

aerospace,fehep28,t1_fegzy52,1579114999.0,To be fair JP 8 is a military fuel with a ton of additives. Those additives are likely the most dangerous part. Jet A is a different mix.
atheism,feg0cj7,t3_eorz03,1579071560.0,One cannot use reason to argue against a position reason did not get one into.
flying,fedlew3,t3_eo5wtr,1579014417.0,Great explanation. Thanks.
flying,fecktus,t3_eo5wtr,1578976374.0,"The bar in the left is KIAS right? How is there such a large difference between indicated and true? Does that mean there's a 100 kt tail wind? 

I'm a newish system safety engineer with no piloting experience (but lots of interest)  that helps certify glass cockpits, etc. for an OEM helicopter company... this is just beyond me...

widowers,fdt8co6,t3_emzzml,1578713251.0,"Everyone handles it differently. We all have our moments. I've felt bad for not breaking down at times, but I've also impressed myself with how stoic and strong I've been at certain moments. One thing holds very true among it all, you deal with it how you deal with it. That's not the same for anyone or anytime. Even though we're in this shitty club together that  doesnt mean we've experienced the same things. 

You do you. I'm doing me. And that's perfectly fine."
widowers,fdt5vvw,t3_emxp2e,1578712323.0,"She's the one who got me to watch Game of Thrones in the first place. No matter how shitily it ended, I got to see it and she didn't. Feels bad man."
todayilearned,fdcjb8k,t1_fdciuff,1578276308.0,"There was a ceremony with the graduating class that our senior design prof suggested going to. It holds no weight whatsoever, I don't even have my FE. But it just serves as a reminder. They used to be made of the steel of a collapsed bridge in Canada but they're just cheap stainless steel anymore. They framed the oath for us and it hung on my wall in my cube until the 115 degree heat in my car in Phoenix made the glue melt... you know I should fix that thing still."
todayilearned,fdcilhm,t1_fdcegbt,1578275807.0,"Yep. Graduated 2016. Some of my professors wore them to though. They were probably in their 50s. It always resonated with me though, know that you have done your due diligence on making sure everything is right before signing off on anything."
todayilearned,fdc4y2g,t1_fda861i,1578267192.0,I wear my ring everyday. US aerospace engineer.

TwoXChromosomes,fa9i68l,t3_e82eou,1575874667.0,As a normal bs mech eng graduate... congratulations! That's a hell of an achievement. And a company to pay for your ms to boot. I must say im jelly too. But in a good way. Best of luck to you!
