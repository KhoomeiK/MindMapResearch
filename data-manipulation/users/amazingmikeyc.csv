PHP,ff9d7qs,t1_ff999r1,1579710426.0,totally. knowing what to refactor and when (and how - and why!) is a skill that separates the skilled developers from the hacker script kiddies. I'm not sure where I am on that scale but I'm getting there....
PHP,ff97owh,t1_ff8yjdu,1579706768.0,"BUT if one of the requirements *requires* you change this terrible code, then you *will* need to refactor! It's not that simple that you can always just abandon the working code."
funny,ff96yr3,t1_ff8zsbp,1579706299.0,"> because Medium would get confused with cooking meat to medium done-ness

good point, they would have to invent a new word for it like Starbucks did. ""CALF"" ""COW"" ""BULL"""
funny,ff8yw9s,t1_ff8xd6b,1579700446.0,"yeah but how big a burger does that relate to? With drinks they have small medium and large rather than 350, 475, 600ml or whatever. Why? Because all that matters to anyone is that one is more in size than the other not by how much it is and most people don't really know or care how much x ml of drink is."
funny,ff8x1hf,t1_ff8u96g,1579698878.0,it's not a useful meaning if nobody knows what it is though!
AmItheAsshole,ff8u3cg,t1_ff8hi1l,1579696122.0,"yeah you need to point out that caring for a little one is a full-time job too, and that you're as entitled to rest as much as him! When my wife was off on maternity I would take over when I got in from work - sometimes it was annoying because I was exhausted but often so was my wife so I sucked it up and usually enjoyed hanging with my son for an hour or 2.

Hopefully he is just ignorant and hasn't really thought about it properly. Does he have any manfriends who have had similar experiences who can sort him out (I say this because sometimes it is better to have such constructive criticism come from a 3rd party)"
funny,ff8tm9l,t1_ff8p651,1579695628.0,why don't they just do Medium and Large ??

DoesAnybodyElse,ff5rnx3,t1_ff4ief3,1579607597.0,but you haven't been born yet surely????
DoesAnybodyElse,ff5rmr4,t1_ff4z0zl,1579607559.0,"I think *different* things have changed. Like fashion and films and music and games are mostly iterations of what's gone before and there's still the same kind of town infrastructure as there was - wide roads, out-of-town supermarkets etc. People still get in their cars and drive to work 9-5 etc and live in suburban houses etc

But *\_so much\_* has changed socially - especially in the last decade. And I suspect the next decade the first things I've listed will start to change too..."

DoesAnybodyElse,ff5qvof,t1_ff4to2q,1579606628.0,It's very 00's because... that's when it was set.

PHP,ff5qlfc,t1_ff5lkp3,1579606259.0,is this like how supposedly Ben Affleck and Matt Damon put a graphic sex scene in Good Will Hunting to see if anyone read it?
AmItheAsshole,ff3ejd5,t1_ff3awxd,1579539460.0,"I don't think saying he shouldn't have certain foods in his house is ""forcing"" him - he's still free to eat elsewhere and obviously spends at least half his time at his mothers! Parents choose what food kids eat based on what they think is right and good - it's part of parenting!

BUT I am sure we agree that in this case the kid's needs are an afterthought and Dad's not put much effort in to find vegan food that he likes. You can't just suddenly switch up routines and expect your children to follow instantly. Dad needs to take responsibility for his own inability to control his own diet and not use his son as a prop"
AmItheAsshole,ff2y03b,t1_ff2amvz,1579528221.0,but did you mostly enjoy what you ate though? in this story the issue's that the kid doesn't like the vegan alternatives.
AmItheAsshole,ff2xvys,t1_ff1tg66,1579528117.0,"Er... saying Vegan is like being Kosher or halal is an analogy that only works if you eat pork every day and it's really hard to buy food that doesn't have pork in.

Furthermore it's not like he has a big moral issue with meat, it's implied he's doing it for health reasons so there's no reason he should have a problem with what everyone else eats. He's just blaming others for the fact he likes chocolate."
AmItheAsshole,ff2xe9d,t1_ff2o1nf,1579527660.0,do they use different sized glasses for different sized bars?
explainlikeimfive,ff2mofk,t1_fen6606,1579513588.0,"You can do what you like, man, but fair use, libel and copyright laws are different. Why risk the fact that Ford might sue you over confusing stupid filmgoers?"
explainlikeimfive,ff2mkcl,t1_fenji19,1579513411.0,"because Lego gave the film company permission (because they produced it). Evidently the producers of Le Mans vs Ford couldn't be bothered/didn't think they could get it. 

Basically trademarks are about whether or not people are going to be confused. I can't start a company called Apple Internet because people would understandably think it was associated with the Apple that makes other computery things. But I might be able to make a pedalo hire company called Apple Boats, because it's a different sector and there is little chance of confusion.

Lots of European territories would take the position that calling a film about toilet cleaning e.g Cillit Bang: The Movie implies that it's associated with the cleaning brand. If they went to the movie and it was, I dunno, racist, Cillit Bang would be upset because everyone would now think they were endorsing it! Confusion. Why bother worrying about the risk? Just call it The Generic Toilet Cleaner Movie."
explainlikeimfive,femvxap,t1_femr279,1579271016.0,"Annoyingly I can't find where I heard that  but there's a mention in the talk page on wikipedia where someone else is also as frustratingly vague as me

explainlikeimfive,fempz4d,t1_femmv9a,1579266161.0,I mean you can set up your computers in the same room but nowadays you would probably find if fast enough connecting over the internet rather than wiring eachother up and faffing with DHCP or whatever.
explainlikeimfive,femps5u,t1_femjkai,1579265984.0,no it's that rules on using brand names are different in europe
explainlikeimfive,fempq63,t1_femcnay,1579265932.0,"It's different in Europe because there'd be potential legal trouble having brand names in the title. ie it's ""really"" called Ford vs Ferrari not the other way around."
todayilearned,fdmz1oy,t1_fdkmj6i,1578571977.0,I'm sympathetic to the idea of the coalition and some of the stuff the libdems tried but yeah. Clegg should've pulled out of the coalition in about 2012 I reckon but he was fucked whatever he did.

todayilearned,fdmyu1o,t1_fdkjnfy,1578571745.0,"I know but the headline ""city of Liverpool \[boycott after disaster at the\] city's Hillsborough Stadium"". It's a different city's stadium. I know I'm being pedantic but facts matter! And the fact that it's not in Liverpool is a key part of why the accident happened and why and how it was able to be covered up -  (eg I suspect Merseyside police would've had a more personal stake in it and so acted differently...)"
todayilearned,fdk89d8,t1_fdk69x4,1578498331.0,ok maybe I am being snarky but the headline read to me like they were saying the stadium was in Liverpool.

todayilearned,fcu7hjs,t1_fctueoq,1577974381.0,"oh yeah, while I say I think it could be streamlined I mean made clearer and easier to follow without making it less safe/unfair whatever (ideally a win/win). In practice that's really hard to do so I ignore anyone who wants to scrap regulations because generally they either don't know why they're there or they think they're above it."

(I totally think that (speaking only from a UK perspective here!) that there is probably an argument for simplifying health & safety and similar legislation into a more coherant framework but they do seem to forget that nearly every piece of regulation is in place because *someone died -* and similarly all other regulations are because someone innocent got shafted quite horribly)"
