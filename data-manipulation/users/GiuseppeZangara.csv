Most hostile feelings come from the perception that the United States and Europe has been intervening and disrupting politics in the Middle East in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This began between Iran and the US in 1953, when the CIA and MI6 participated in a coup which deposed the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of  Mohammad Reza Shah. This came about because Mosaddegh was a left-leaning leader who wished to nationalize Iran's oil production, which at that time was largely controlled by British-owned companies. There was also some fear that Iran was coming under Soviet influence under Mosaddegh.

CIA activities included forming anti-communist guerrilla militias, bribing officials, and paying double-agent protesters to commit acts that would decrease public support for Mosaddegh's government.

The coup was successful and Mohammad Reza Shah was propped up by the British and Americans as the leader of Iran until 1979. They also ensured that Soviet access to Iran's oil was cut off. 

America's role in the coup and their support of Mohammad Reza Shah has never been forgotten or forgiven in Iran. The revolution of 1979 was the result of dissatisfaction with Reza Shah in general and specifically Western influence over his government. The revolution did bot begin as a specifically Islamist revolution, but Islamic groups were quickly able to establish supremacy in the power vacuum left by Mohammad Reza Shah's abdication. 

In many ways, the current Iranian government was created specifically as a response to US influence over their country, and it has been part of its DNA ever since. Most events since 1979 have done little to repair relations. 

* In 1979 there was the hostage crisis in which 53 US diplomats were held hostage for over a year. This also resulted in the death of US servicemen in a failed rescue mission.
* The US materially supported Iraq and Saddam Hussein during the very bloody and prolonged Iran-Iraq War.
* In 1983 the US embassy in Beirut was bombed by pro-Iranian terrorists, killing 17 Americans.
* Operation Praying Mantis was launched by the US after a US ship was damaged by an Iran laid Mine in the Persian Gulf. This skirmish occurred in Iran controlled waters and resulted in the death of 56 Iranians.
* Possibly most significantly since the revolution, the US shot down an Iran Air commercial airliner with a surface to air missile, killing all 290 people on board. The US has said that it was an accident and has offered no formal apology. They did provide a financial settlement to the family of victims.
* In 1995 Clinton imposed and embargo on Iran.
* In the late-1990s and early-2000s US-Iranian relations were getting better. Iran's new president Mohammad Khatami was a reformer who wished to improve relations with the US. They publicly condemned the 9/11 terrorist attacks and even provided early support against the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
* Support faltered in 2002 when George W. Bush gave his famous ""Axis of Evil"" speech. Bush said that the ""Axis of Evil"" included Iraq, North Korea, and Iran. This severely damaged the improving US-Iran relations.
* Since 2003 Iran has been developing a nuclear program. They claim that this is only for energy purposes, but of course the US and other nations fear that they also have the goal of developing nuclear weapons, which would be a great threat to Israel and destabilize the region. This eventually led to the Iran nuclear deal in which they agreed to give up their nuclear program and allow the UN to do facility checks. Trump pulled out of this deal in 2018 and reimposed economic sanctions against Iran.
* Iran has also been supporting a growing number of militias in Iraq and Syria, some of which have been involved in conflict with US soldiers. These groups have actively fought in Syrian Civil War as an ally of Assad against Rebel and ISIS forces, and in Northern Iraq against ISIS forces. 

This is a very brief summary of US-Iran relations since 1953. Many many books and articles have been written about these events. In particular I recommend All the Shah's Men by Stephen Kinzer, which details the 1953 coup. It may sound simplistic, but much of our relationship with Iran stems from this event.

AskReddit,fdf4xr8,t3_el17zi,1578353402.0,"The Act of Killing. It's a documentary that follows the perpetrators of the [Indonesian Genocide of 1965-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366). It was state sponsored mass murder that Indonesia has never acknowledged and the perpetrators have never been officially blamed for or prosecuted. These men live fairly normal lives and are pretty open about what happened. 

What makes this documentary brilliant is that the director had the actual perpetrators recreate the mass killings in the documentary. I won't go into detail, but these recreations have an interesting effect on the perpetrators. I'll just say that I think the director was able to get a much more honest response than if had come at them in a more direct way.

worldnews,fdec4l1,t1_fde01gb,1578335791.0,"> Middle East

The Middle East contains 18 countries and more than 300 million people. You aren't going to find a simple answer about the entire middle east because it is a large and diverse area with many many differing viewpoints.

Most hostile feelings come from the perception that the United States and Europe has been intervening and disrupting politics in the Middle East in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This began between Iran and the US in 1953, when the CIA and MI6 participated in a coup which deposed the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of  Mohammad Reza Shah. This came about because Mosaddegh was a left-leaning leader who wished to nationalize Iran's oil production, which at that time was largely controlled by British-owned companies. There was also some fear that Iran was coming under Soviet influence under Mosaddegh.

CIA activities included forming anti-communist guerrilla militias, bribing officials, and paying double-agent protesters to commit acts that would decrease public support for Mosaddegh's government.

The coup was successful and Mohammad Reza Shah was propped up by the British and Americans as the leader of Iran until 1979. They also ensured that Soviet access to Iran's oil was cut off. 

America's role in the coup and their support of Mohammad Reza Shah has never been forgotten or forgiven in Iran. The revolution of 1979 was the result of dissatisfaction with Reza Shah in general and specifically Western influence over his government. The revolution did bot begin as a specifically Islamist revolution, but Islamic groups were quickly able to establish supremacy in the power vacuum left by Mohammad Reza Shah's abdication. 

In many ways, the current Iranian government was created specifically as a response to US influence over their country, and it has been part of its DNA ever since. Most events since 1979 have done little to repair relations. 

* In 1979 there was the hostage crisis in which 53 US diplomats were held hostage for over a year. This also resulted in the death of US servicemen in a failed rescue mission.
* The US materially supported Iraq and Saddam Hussein during the very bloody and prolonged Iran-Iraq War.
* In 1983 the US embassy in Beirut was bombed by pro-Iranian terrorists, killing 17 Americans.
* Operation Praying Mantis was launched by the US after a US ship was damaged by an Iran laid Mine in the Persian Gulf. This skirmish occurred in Iran controlled waters and resulted in the death of 56 Iranians.
* Possibly most significantly since the revolution, the US shot down an Iran Air commercial airliner with a surface to air missile, killing all 290 people on board. The US has said that it was an accident and has offered no formal apology. They did provide a financial settlement to the family of victims.
* In 1995 Clinton imposed and embargo on Iran.
* In the late-1990s and early-2000s US-Iranian relations were getting better. Iran's new president Mohammad Khatami was a reformer who wished to improve relations with the US. They publicly condemned the 9/11 terrorist attacks and even provided early support against the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
* Support faltered in 2002 when George W. Bush gave his famous ""Axis of Evil"" speech. Bush said that the ""Axis of Evil"" included Iraq, North Korea, and Iran. This severely damaged the improving US-Iran relations.
* Since 2003 Iran has been developing a nuclear program. They claim that this is only for energy purposes, but of course the US and other nations fear that they also have the goal of developing nuclear weapons, which would be a great threat to Israel and destabilize the region.
