BlackPeopleTwitter,fevhdf8,t1_fevghyq,1579397463.0,"Alright, here's an answer that reflects me participating in good faith, even though I know you won't afford me the same privilege.

You have that username because you chose to have it. You don't choose poverty. You're born into it. Nobody chooses poverty. Nobody.

If you are actually, with a completely straight face, likening choosing a Reddit handle to being born in a family with uneducated, underpaid parents, in an area where the city doesn't even give your school enough money for proper text books and teachers, then I honestly don't know what to say. I actually don't."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fevgqg2,t1_fevepw3,1579397199.0,"> So we just going to ignore the fact that she can’t leave earlier and maybe have to walk a few extra minutes lol?

Time is money, and poor people don't have much. You think her predicament is a result of some inherent laziness that she possesses, but I could tell you right now that it's bullshit. If she has responsibilities and prior committments aside from school, you can't just ask her to uproot her whole schedule just so she can get something so simple as parking space.

> Move closer to campus

Housing crisis, dipshit. You're beginning to piss me off with how fucking stupid you are right now.

> Goes right back to being responsible. My girl damn sure knew she was going to have her hands full with kids and college. Maybe be responsible and have kids later (this will tweak a nerve, I can already tell).

You want there to be sexual education in inner city schools that are historically underfunded? Then fund the fucking schools and let these people be informed that their choices aren't optimal. Don't fucking tell me no one ever told you not to have kids before going to university.

This will tweak a nerve, since you probably don't believe that racism still exists, and manifests in where cities direct their funds. 

And that's just an 'if'. She could still be working one or several jobs to afford tuition. She doesn't actually have to have a child. Your fixation on this bit does actually show me that you're looking for every excuse to explain how her life is going terribly, and that it's her fault.

Do you, like, not have compassion or anything?

I wouldn't expect compassion from someone who regularly browses T_D, but I still expected better. It's a shame, but that's life.

> Maybe find a closer job to your campus. All in all, you were the one that enrolled yourself. This shouldn’t have been a shock.

Either you're being an asshole, or you're young and immature. If all she ever needed to do was obvious shit like move closer to campus and get a job closer to campus, which accommodates her well enough, and pays well enough, don't you think she would have already done it?

Maybe not, lol, because employers tend to get pissy when you're searching for other jobs. Did you ever stop to think that maybe she could get fired if she was caught hunting for a job, or does your perfect fantasy land not extend beyond ""find job, get money, success""?

> Stop blaming others for your lack of responsibility.

You wouldn't be saying this if you knew her full situation, but sure. It's so easy to judge from where you're standing.

Also, can I just comment on this bit?

> Simple response to your pathetic novel.

It's funny, because it tells me a lot about how your brain works. If a solution isn't simple and easily digestible, and if it takes more than one minute to mull over and understand, it's not worth thinking about at all. You would literally rather dumb down reality and propose solutions that are completely inapplicable, rather than face reality and understand that the situation is much more complex than you think.

Maybe I should make this simpler for you to understand: things are real even if you don't want them to be. It's a shocker, I know, but hopefully, you'll grow up from this lesson."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fevd2ap,t1_fevc1j9,1579395943.0,"> Thanks dawg. What about the people that paid for a spot with their own money, arrive at the location and cannot find a spot; however do find cars parked there that do not have a permit?

She's not the bad guy in this story. The school is. She, plus the people that were forced to shell out 800 bucks for a fucking parking permit, were all victims in an unfair system, one which you choose to ignore by heaping all the blame on the girl.

When you're poor, you do things that aren't necessarily legal, because there is literally no other fucking alternative. There is none. I repeat, this is called poverty, and the fact that you don't believe this exists astounds me.

I say that you don't believe it exists because you still chose to say this.

> I’ll kindly fuck off when you quit blaming others for lack of responsibility. 

Scratch 'responsibility', and replace it with 'money', which some people don't have in abundance. Imagine that, huh?

> Maybe you got to use public transportation; which is probably free if you claiming poverty.

I've got friends that MUST use their cars because they live too far away from campus to commute regularly without infringing on other responsibilities, such as taking care of children, or working at jobs where they try to earn enough money to pay for tuition, rent, food, utilities, you know, things you stress about when you're **poor**. An 800 dollar parking permit could be half of someone's rent. How the hell do you expect a poor person to pay this?

> Blaming others on the internet is a lot easier than ~~taking responsibility~~ having money. Pay up my girl; Cash or card?

There. Fixed that for you :)

But seriously, though. Are you actually incapable of understanding that people can't just pay for everything, especially not something as arbitrary as an overpriced parking permit?"
