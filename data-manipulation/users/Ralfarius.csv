Wild ferments are just that, wild. Honey is not a very hospitable environment so the first organism that gets a foothold will dominate. We combat this when using purpose-bred yeast by giving it the best chance possible with rehydration and nutrition. Fermaid-O uses organic nitrogen as opposed to DAP and is great for your yeast without being 'industrial stuff.'

Clarifying mead is ultimately a waiting game but there's a bunch of useful things to speed the process along, but it depends on what you consider 'natural' vs 'industrial.'"

mead,fetx9ek,t1_fetdbgp,1579381010.0,"As u/cmc589 said, the particulate from the fruit allow the yeast to drop of out of suspension more readily. 

This has definitely been the case for me as well. I've started melomels/cyser well after traditionals and they've cleared way faster.

Things you can try:

Cold crashing (put it in the fridge)

Bentonite (type of clay, make sure it's food grade)

Sparkolloid (great to use alongside bentonite)

Super Kleer (kieselsol & chitosan - derived from shellfish chitin)

[Filtering](http://madalchemead.com/how-to-filter-mead/) (not really recommended unless you're a little more advanced in experience and equipment)

So Super Kleer is basically made of magic. I had a dry traditional sitting in secondary for 3 months with very little progress. Dropped Super Kleer in and it was crystal clear in like 12 hours flat. Even after disturbing a container it re-settled in less than a day.

Some things to consider for your future adventures in the hobby:

- If you don't already, get a hydrometer. Gravity readings are the only way to be certain that fermentation is done. Bottling while the yeast is still active risks either the cork flying out or your bottles turning into messy (and dangerous) glass grenades

- a bottling wand is immensely helpful in getting a consistent fill across your bottles. You want the liquid up to the neck, and the wand displaces just enough liquid to give exactly that if you fill almost to the tippy top before removing it. If you have less than a bottle-to-the-neck left over, no worries. Just fill up the last with what you got, maybe toss it in the fridge and plan to drink it within a few days.

- a secondary vessel. When mead is done fermenting, your best bet is to rack the liquid off the yeast cake. This gives the liquid a chance to clarify and develop in a clean environment.

Also if you haven't yet, [check out the wiki!](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/wiki/index) It has saved me a ton of heartache and answered every question I've had so far to the point where I haven't actually had to make a thread to ask.
