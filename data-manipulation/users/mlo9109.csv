raisedbynarcissists,fftbvc1,t1_ffsmw6g,1580215799.0,She threw an actual fit over this and I had to close the meal train. Now I look like a scammer and feel like an ass!
Advice,fftbsy7,t1_fft4qvr,1580215735.0,"Same! Race wasn't the issue. I became more ageist as a millennial. Baby boomers (especially white ones) are holy terrors. ""Why do I have to use the devil machine (computer or smartphone app) for everything?"" "" Asking for phone number? Privacy!"" In my mind, I'm thinking, adapt or die already!"
exchristian,ffsheap,t1_ffs8pyq,1580181755.0,"Amy Winehouse's death was used as a ""scared straight"" lesson about drugs with the Upward Bound kids I was teaching at the time at a public university. Non-religious folks do it, too."
unpopularopinion,ffr9i6b,t3_euo89z,1580153377.0,"The expectation to drink, period, is ridiculous. I was in AmeriCorps and we weren't allowed to drink while ""on the clock"" and that included networking events we were asked to attend that often included alcohol. It was super awkward since everyone else (non-AmeriCorps folks) were drinking. Not to mention, people don't drink for a variety of reasons (religion, health, pregnancy, etc.) You do you, friend!"
unpopularopinion,ffr77qw,t3_euocl7,1580151955.0,"Mine turned out to be a distant, wealthy cousin after I took a 23 and Me test. She was, and still is, in fact, a spoilt little shit. She inherited the family business after her grandparents died and she and her husband have a wonderful life. Meanwhile, I've barely accomplished shit since high school (single, renter with a master's in education I'm too burnt out to use)."
raisedbynarcissists,ffr2bo7,t3_euoe4a,1580148916.0,"I feel you...NMom called my friends strangers when I set up a meal train for her (she's undergoing cancer treatment) and shared it on Facebook. Like, really? I know these people and some of them are damn good cooks."
exchristian,ffqijh1,t1_ffq3to5,1580135567.0,"Hindu and Indian culture are intertwined, he says. He thinks Christianity and American culture are the same, hence why he encourages me to attend church. His parents sent him to Christian School because it was the best option available to them."
exchristian,ffqh0au,t1_ffqgkm9,1580134337.0,I've been in a situation where my relationship ended because of cultural differences. I dated a Muslim for 2 years until he left me for an arranged marriage. I guess I'm trying to insure myself against it happening again. My family and friends' form of support was throwing the unequally yolked Bible verse at me.
CaregiverSupport,ffqgoj7,t3_euigcu,1580134064.0,"Hugs to you. I don't usually get shaken up over celebrity deaths but the fact that Kobe and his daughter both died scares me as an only child. The mom and other siblings still have each other. If anything happens to me, mom and dad are alone. They still have siblings around, but they're older as well. Being an only child sucks!"
hinduism,ffpi77m,t1_ffpgldr,1580095652.0,I've checked it out and I'm curious how I'd be received as a white American woman.
Teachers,ffp7lt4,t3_eubzxh,1580088238.0,Yes! I learned to read at 3. I was bored in kindergarten. I spent most of my time reading or playing computer games (Carmen Sandiego). My teacher (mean Catholic nun) labeled me as antisocial. Imagine if my gifts were nurtured.
AskWomenOver30,ffmzf6r,t3_eu71ux,1580060445.0,28... My partner of 2 years left. I fell into a deep depression and learned the value of self care.
rant,ffk29ji,t3_eu1gcx,1580013585.0,"Agreed! Also, fix your damn pets! A dog I follow on Instagram is in heat. Owner refuses to fix her because of how it will supposedly change her fur texture. Take her to a groomer and fix her! Innocent animals die from that kind of stupidity!"
