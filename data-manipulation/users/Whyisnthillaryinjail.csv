Sorry to post twice but I also want to come back and point out that every gain the working class has made in working conditions/pay/safety has been made *in spite of capitalism*, not because of it. I mean that quite literally. Workers had to actually fight to the death just for the right to organize, boys as young as 13 *in America* were gunned down by guards striking for the 8 hour workday. In at least one instance the 8 hour workday was already law and our own national guard burnt to death dozens of men, women, and even infants who were striking for *enforcement* of what was *already law* (the Ludlow massacre).

Like 1860-1950 U.S. history is basically non stop low scale civil warfare all across the country. The Harlan County Coal Wars, the Battles of Matewan and Blair Mountain, the National Farmers' Holiday Association, the Copper Country Strikes, the Pressed Steel Car Company strike, the Lawrence Textile Mill strikes, god damn i could go on all day. 

Every single concession the working class has ever gained has either been through bloody struggle, or through the threat of it. 

P.s. this isn't even going into the horrors American foreign policy has wrought around the world on countries which tried to go socialist, i.e. murdering Salvador Allende because he wanted to nationalize Chile's copper mines, or Iran's Mossadegh because he wanted to nationalize the AIOC's (now BP) oil fields after the company refused to cooperate with parliamentary requests for an audit. You're like ""capitalism is the greatest we have"" while ignoring that the U.S. alone has killed literally millions across dozens of countries to ensure its hegemony and to ensure its multinational corporations have access to loot resources across the globe."
Futurology,ffgcib7,t1_ffg6awv,1579903199.0,"This whole post is just purely ideological bullshit and literally the same ""it's not perfect but it's the best we have"" statement could be used to defend any other system of property ownership in history. 

>Socialism and Communism are interesting ideologies, but realistically speaking we humans will never, ever be able to integrate them in our society, for one simple reason: we, just like all mammals and a huge part of the animal kingdom, are hierarchical creatures, it's something we have in out nature, impossible to be removed due to biology.

This is essentially the ""But human nature!"" 'argument' which is literally just a meme with no basis in fact. In fact, Pyotr Kropotkin wrote a whole book on how *wrong* this basic premise is called [Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution) that discusses how the exact opposite is true- that humanity's evolutionary success is thanks to the mutual cooperation that results from society and socialization. 

This isn't even going into the fact that *anarchist* forms of socialism seek not the total abolition of all hierarchy, but rather the abolition of hierarchies which are arbitrary or unjust i.e. ""I'm the boss, I own all of your labor, not due to any merit of my own but simply because I possess the deed/machinery/shares/etc."" Workers can still have ""bosses,"" but the workers should be free to organize their own workplaces rather than have the terms of their own labor dictated to them. 

>And so capitalism is something that will always be part of our society, that's fundamentally undeniable.

You're ascribing an almost religious ""it was always here, and always will be"" sort of reverence for what is literally *just* a system of property ownership that only even exists because of the centralization of production allowed by industrialization. It's insane. 

>Now by no means i'm saying it's perfect, but it's the best thing we got right now, the benefits of this system are incredible and we are what we are today thanks to it. Capitalism pales in comparison to any other form of government and, most importantly, it's the only system that actually produces wealth

Dude, what? Wealth was produced before capitalism existed. Wealth is produced independent of any determination over who owns the labor- the only difference is that under capitalism that wealth which is produced is owned by the capitalist (who owns the labor, but does not actually perform it) rather than those who are employed to actually labor (who are paid a portion of the value they actually create).

>Which means less people are in extremely low poverty, so more food, education and healthcare for everyone.

Except this isn't true and all the statistics used to show ""global poverty is decreasing"" are *extremely* misleading and don't hold up to logical scrutiny. [Look up Jason Hickel's essays/takedown of Stephen Pinker (the ideologue most responsible for pushing the narrative you reference).](https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2019/2/3/pinker-and-global-poverty)

In particular he notes that:

>**Using the $1.90 line shows that only 700 million people live in poverty.  But note that the UN’s FAO says that 815 million people do not have enough calories to sustain even “minimal” human activity.  1.5 billion are food insecure, and do not have enough calories to sustain “normal” human activity.  And 2.1 billion suffer from malnutrition.  How can there be fewer poor people than hungry and malnourished people?  If $1.90 is inadequate to achieve basic nutrition and sustain normal human activity, then it’s too low – period.  It’s time for you and Gates to stop using it.  Lifting people above this line doesn’t mean lifting them out of poverty, “extreme” or otherwise.**

Which seems like a pretty compelling case for ""this narrative is bullshit""

>At the same time you will not be able to achieve too much equality since, as i said, humans will always organize themselves in a hierarchy and you surely want to ensure this structure is based on meritocracy right?  

Then you should support the total abolition of a system that allows for almost unlimited inherited wealth and which rewards the ownership of the labor of others the most, rather than rewarding people for doing good work. 

>We often say ""capitalists"" are corrupt or that they have no competence, but the truth is a person who climbs that high cannot be stupid or naive, these people know what they're doing. 

Like what even is this? ""If they're rich they must know what they're doing""? Like damn dude do I even need to say anything to this?

Edit: also forgot to point out that ""socialism"" and ""Communism"" aren't even ideologies. Socialism refers to a *range of ideologies* primarily concerned with the social ownership of production to various degrees and in various manners, basically because capitalism is slavery with more steps and needs to be abolished. There is a lot of variation in individual socialist ideologies though. Like look up anarcho syndicalism for a *libertarian* socialist example. Look up Marxism Leninism for a more authoritarian antithesis.

""Communism"" is literally just a theoretical moneyless, classless, stateless state of society thought to occur after the full implementation of socialism- full stop. Any party or nation called ""communist"" is so called because that state of society is the nominal end goal of their particular ideology, which itself might be Marxism-Leninism or whatever."

>If it were not for you, the capitalist would have to walk, and if it were not for him, you would ride.

>You don’t need the capitalist; he is, in fact, a curse to you. What has the capitalist owner of a modern plant to do with its operation? Absolutely nothing. He might as well live in the moon, as far as you are concerned. There may be a group of them, but they have nothing to do with the mill. They simply get what is produced there, because you will have it so. You are organized on that basis. In your moss-covered old unions you say, “Our interests are mutual.” Certainly, if you can stand this arrangement the capitalist can. He has no grievance. He does nothing and gets everything, and you do everything and get nothing.

>If you can stand this he can; and if you don’t put an end to it he won’t. And why should he? And why shouldn’t you? Mr. Workingman. you are a man. You ought not to be satisfied to be a mere wealth-producing animal. You have a brain, and you ought to develop it. You should aspire to rise above the animal plane. If you can work in a mill and produce wealth for a capitalist, who holds you in contempt, you can also work in that mill as free man and produce wealth for yourself and your wife and family to enjoy. If not, why not?

""Both sides"" may not be *equally* corrupt, but both major parties absolutely *are* corrupt, and for the same reasons (the effect of capitalism on 'democracy'). Just because there are differences in the scale of corruption doesn't mean that that isn't the case.

>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. ***The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.*** Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

1) Even the Indian viceroy felt that India's concerns were being treated with hostility and contempt by the British government

2) They calculated an estimate of rice shortages and used this estimate as a basis to request shipping allocations to import 600,000 tons of wheat. Which was rejected. But it's okay, Churchill sent wheat after millions had died? 

3) It mentions specifically that the famine was never actually declared a famine, which would have:

>brought in an obligation to organize work programmes and relief operations specified by the 'Famine Code', dating from 1883; Sir T. Rutherford, the Governor of Bengal, explained to the Viceroy: 'The Famine Code has not been applied as we simply have not the food to give the prescribed ration.'

4) Bengal was not the only province of the British Raj, other areas could have exported food to Bengal but there were restrictions put in place preventing this

5) There was enough food in Bengal, the issue was with the distribution of the food.

Remember when I quoted that article and left in that bit about the Bihar famine and how it was eased through increased importations and public assistance programs?

Or maybe [The Conquest of Bread](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread) if you want an example of someone talking about how little we could work if productivity gains and the rewards of automation were shared... ***in the 1800s***. And I mean the rest of it's good too. 

Like, you'd think if people in literally the 1800s were talking about how we, at that time, had so advanced our productive capacities that a certain degree of luxury could be enjoyed by all- you'd think you'd ask yourself ""Well, why hasn't this occurred in almost 150 years? What force could be holding back social progress on these fronts?"" But instead you just... don't question capitalism, it's the best, all hail the holy Hand. Fuckin' crazy on top of ignorant."

As you make idealistic statements about ""what the goals of capitalism are"" that you could literally transpose to feudalism, or any other system of property ownership really. Um excuse me but didn't you know the goal of feudalism is to make life better for the serfs??? Like that's pretty much the level of understanding you're displaying here. 

Your opinions are garbage, and you don't know what you're talking about. 

If it worked the way your dumb brain thinks then why did the Battle of Matewan happen? The Harlan County Coal Wars? The National Farmers' Holiday Association? The Copper Country strikes? The Pressed Steel Car Company strike? I could name dozens and dozens more. If capitalism is an anthropomorphic entity with the overt desire to just make life better for people, then why did working people have to literally take up weapons and fight for the basic rights we have today? Why do you just shrug and attribute their victories to the invisible hand, given that they were struggling AGAINST the interests of their capitalist employers? 

The answer is that capitalism doesn't have a goal other than the maintenance of capitalist property relations, and these property relations inevitably result in the interests of the workers existing in opposition to the interests of their employers. There is no profit without stolen wage, and there is no wage labor under capitalism which is not inherently exploitative (because the overwhelming majority of working people MUST work for an employer or else have no alternative but to starve to death in the streets).

Capitalism doesn't have a ""goal"" dude, it's literally just a system of property ownership. 

This is literally all naive idealism from someone who basically projects religious beliefs onto a system of property ownership. 

If capitalism were anthropomorphic in the way you treat it and had the actual goal of bettering the lives of working people then those same working people wouldn't have had to organize and threaten their employers and governments with force of arms just to achieve basic rights and legal protections. Except woops, ***that's what workers had to do*** and rather than improve and widen those protections capitalists in general seek instead to remove them wherever able or outsource labor needs to shittier countries (typically ones the CIA has prevented labor organization from occurring or succeeding in) so that they don't have to worry about it. 

Believe whatever you want, but that's all it'll be- an absurdly naive belief that has no actual material connection to the real world. You're worshipping an ideal that doesn't exist and has never existed. In the real world capitalism has seen shit like the U.S. government threatening to invade Colombia if they didn't put down striking banana pickers. Literally 1-3000 people killed in the 1920s because God forbid the pickers be paid a living wage and Americans have to pay a nickel more for a banana. And yeah, this is one random example but I could go on all fucking god damn DAY about the horrors capitalism has wrought on the world. Like how we sent the Marines to install a military dictatorship in Guatemala FOR THE SAME FRUIT COMPANY."

This is the kind of fantasy world bullshit that comes from liberals who are so ignorant of the history of capitalism and labor that they literally think ""capitalism is the best"" 

You're pretty much just expecting capitalists to give the public a share of the profitability of the ownership of automation out of the goodness of their hearts, when if you look at actual history the working class has literally never been given anything it didn't have to fight for. Even things like the 8 hour workday involved people actually fighting and dying to force change.
