rugbyunion,fffloga,t1_ffej3vz,1579886652.0,"There's something that really confuses me about some of the stats criticism around his rate of tackles and carries. It's that I don't see how a professional athlete could manage to get away with avoiding doing work. Like, surely if you can notice this low workrate from looking at the ESPN stats page, his coaches must have noticed too. If he isn't making enough tackles, then that's a fairly basic work on for his coaches to give him. 

What would seem more likely to me is that he is instructed by coaches to position himself in and take a role where he doesn't perform that type of work. This tracks with what I see when I watch him play - he generally positions himself outside the tackle and carry in favour of presenting himself as a threat around the ruck and to clear it out on offensive ball. He's essentially a support forward. He's there to make everyone else's life easier and make the tackles and carries his teammates make more effective through his ruck work."
rugbyunion,ffefvmn,t1_ffe06s4,1579846428.0,"Why are you asking me? Are you telling me you don't know what O'Mahony does on the field?

Best way to find out is to watch him rather than just trusting some stranger on the internet. 

In defense, O'Mahony offers turnover threat at rucks and lineouts, depriving teams of ability to build momentum in a consistent and predictable manner. He is the best turnover threat in the squad. 

He usually positions himself as a floating defender, sometimes to get opportunities to attack and slow down the ball, which he does incredibly effectively, or tracking around the corner to clean up a line break, as he did to strong effect against Saracens the other week, against New Zealand in Dublin, and plenty of other examples. 

In attack, the height he gets in the lineout and the speed to which he gets it is world class. He offers quality, fast ball off the top for Ireland to launch attacks from as well as anyone in the squad. 

In the attacking line, he is positioned in the wider channels where he can 1) get best bang for his buck in terms of carrying metres, and 2) act as a distributor in the wide channels, passing to wingers and putting grubbers through, and 3) to effectively and efficiently clean out rucks where backs would otherwise be isolated, almost like another centre. Munster have not been successful this season at getting quality ball past 10/12, so this side of his game hasn't got much work.

Frankly I think it's absurd that you don't remember what he actually even plays like."
rugbyunion,ffdfj0r,t1_ffdalvr,1579819805.0,"Same as in the World Cup. Give the established players a chance to prove they work well as a unit. Doesn't disrupt Ireland's set piece by removing their best lineout option and replacing him with a competent one. Ireland don't particularly need to pick a backrow specifically to challenge Scotland physically because Ireland have a far stronger tight five. 

If O'Mahony plays shite for Ireland behind a world class tight five, then by all means, take him off at 60 and let's see what Doris can do. But the idea of automatically dropping him for a 21 year old with a completely different skillset and zero international experience is short-sighted, reactive, and just plain daft. 

Any good argument against O'Mahony's selection should be in relation to the overall size and power of a pack with a backrow that has both O'Mahony and Van der Flier in it, and the only reason that's even a problem is because Dan Leavy is injured. Acting like average form for an underperforming team is grounds for being dropped is to be frank, stupid."
rugbyunion,ffd9lbc,t1_ffd8nns,1579816116.0,"Congratulations on actually putting together a point that isn't just ""u mad"". Well done. 

It's still not great, considering Deegan and Doris have been playing against a lower calibre of team than O'Mahony, and have as yet no exposure to the physical intensity of international rugby. seriously. Go through the teamsheets, see how many starting international players Doris has actually come up against. Much better idea to lob a 21 year old onto a pitch against seasoned internationals than, I dunno, pull him off the bench at 60 minutes to run at tired bodies and give him a feel for it. 

And it doesn't ""gotta be"" any of them. They're all highly competent players, Ireland aren't going to fall apart because O'Mahony or Doris wasn't picked."

And you can discuss the merits of players all you like, that's fine by me. Say that Ireland's pack would have better carrying pier with Ruddock over POM and I'd agree with you there. But questioning a player's workrate isn't discussing his merits. It's speculation. It rests in the assumption that he isn't working hard enough, that he could work harder, and any underperformance he has is because he isn't trying hard enough. It rests on the assumption that he isn't doing exactly what he's instructed to do by coaches.

The difference is Josh VdF is in a pack with Cian Healy, Tadhg Furlong, James Ryan, Scott Fardy, Rhys Ruddock, and whichever one of Max Deegan and Caelan Doris is starting on a given day. Leinster's pack, and the team as a whole, are playing remarkably well. Munster are not. So comparing their form like for like is a pointless exercise. 

>The only daft thing is the way you seem to be implying that the only two options are to keep the exact same backrow or change all three entirely.

I'm not. There are five games coming up over 7 weeks. There will be several backrow combinations played. The first one will most likely be the status quo, and Farrell and the rest of the staff will work from there."
rugbyunion,fei670f,t1_fei5eus,1579131167.0,"I can't help but wonder how, if you and all the other armchair analysts have noticed his allegedly poor workrate, why haven't his coaches?

Surely to god, these guys have teams spending massive amounts of time poring over footage and statistics and GPS figures and watching him in training, and yet here they are, getting shown up by a bunch of lads on the Internet that know how to go on ESPN stats?

If O'Mahony's workrate isn't up to scratch, there are one of several possibilities for his continued presence in starting line ups. 1) The coaches just haven't noticed. This seems completely absurd, for reasons I detailed above. 2) They just don't care. They'd rather keep a passenger in the incredibly competitive Ireland squad than actually do anything about it, whether out of apathy or laziness. Again, blatantly absurd. And 3), no one has actually mustered the courage to tell him in fear of his wrath. It says a lot about the other options that somehow, this is the most realistic possibility. 

The other option, and the most likely one IMO, is that successive Irish and Munster coaches know something that Internet randomers don't know. In fact, I'd wager they know lots of things that Internet randomers don't know. That's why they're professional rugby coaches, and we're what, fuckin accountants or something."

You could as easily and accurately blame Van der Flier for not being big or physical enough, or Stander for not being a world class lineout option. O'Mahony was far from the only player underperforming for Ireland or Munster. Dropping him while keeping other players that underperformed is, to be blunt, daft.

A good backrow is about balance. Van Der Flier's usual high tackle count frees up energy resources for Stander and O'Mahony, Stander's carry count frees up energy resources for VdF and POM, and POM's set piece work frees up energy resources for Stander and VdF. Removing O'Mahony upsets that balance and requires the other players and his replacement to fill roles he otherwise would have, and because he is our best lineout forward, none of them would do it to the same standard, and our lineout would suffer. It wouldn't be disastrous, but it would be a significant loss to our game."
