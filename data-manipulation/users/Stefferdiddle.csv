MakeupAddiction,ffffh6d,t3_etbj68,1579882818.0,That is a most excellent purple.
Instagramreality,ffffd42,t3_et7fue,1579882749.0,What drives me more crazy are the overhanging toes over the edge of the shoe.  I would have aimed my photoshop efforts at that.  Or shoes that fit.
Eyebleach,fffeotl,t1_ffez3pm,1579882324.0,Late neutering too.  My cat was neutered when I adopted him at the age of 3 and he retained his giant Persian Yosemite Sam cheeks.
politics,ffdir65,t1_ffc05kh,1579821734.0,I’m pretty sure they believe the Cobra Kai are the protagonists of that movie.
muacirclejerk,ffb2sbq,t1_ffb276p,1579750340.0,It does not involve a foot.  But the last half of your equation is correct.

Lipsticks and Eyeshadow palettes get swapped out about once a month to stave off boredom and for a chance to use other items from my collection."

ProperAnimalNames,ffb0fqh,t3_esld01,1579748732.0,Still a Disco Chicken to me.
aww,ff7ije8,t1_ff71owf,1579650363.0,All those round heads and bodies!  I can’t handle it l.
muacirclejerk,ff7he7i,t3_erwunq,1579649600.0,This is a genius jerk.
AskReddit,feshb95,t1_fer3c97,1579365109.0,Yeah that was definitely soft serve chocolate ice cream they ate.  One can just hope they replaced the cup after pooping in it and then subbing in the ice cream.
AskReddit,fesh43f,t1_fept3ot,1579365025.0,Along with Goatse and meatspin.  All of which only require a millisecond of viewing to repulse a person.
aww,fesg9xl,t1_fer8lwo,1579364874.0,That horse is definitely part Persian cat with a floofy mane like that.
funny,fesft19,t1_fernz4s,1579364720.0,"Hey, at least he left half the vent free..."
BeautyGuruChatter,feo9jkv,t1_feed1gl,1579296972.0,I’m amazed his response was so appropriate for a change.
BeautyGuruChatter,feo9989,t1_fekvp59,1579296796.0,That’s OK.  I thought he was Viktor Krum.  I’m not familiar with him at all.
BeautyGuruChatter,feo8aok,t1_femx81c,1579296453.0,"I’m wanting it more.  Mostly for the fact that it doesn’t eat up the product like a sponge does but blends it better than a brush which is the other alternative.   I’ve seen about 5 beautuber reviews now and they are all amazed by it.   

Also, sponges degrade pretty quickly before needing replacement.   My BB usually starts to break down after the second week of use and washings.  This being made from a more durable fabric makes me think it’s well worth the price.

Heck, even Manny’s foundation looked good for a change.  Though it could be because he properly color matched for a change."
trees,femx4s2,t1_femk018,1579271903.0,Raised in Upstate NY here.  Not only was there a garage fridge but in the wintertime the garage itself also becomes the beverage overflow chilling area.
makeupflatlays,femuglx,t3_epuzzn,1579269916.0,I got that M506 brush about a half a year ago.  I don’t use any other one now for doing my crease.  That and the Morphe pencil brush are my eyeshadow HG brushes.

rareinsults,felnhfz,t1_felgh2f,1579226394.0,You can clearly see features of both the Queen and Prince Phillip in Harry’s face. Especially as he gets older.
Youniqueamua,fekrygz,t1_fek9c24,1579206366.0,Somehow juicy and dry simultaneously.
persiancat,feijn3c,t3_epbjdt,1579140061.0,I love him!
aww,fefyzb8,t1_feftm9l,1579070035.0,That’s so brilliant and accurate.  But for me it would be eyebrows.
aww,fefywi7,t1_fefypl5,1579069952.0,I’m afraid he’s already there.  Maybe not quite at Henry Cavil levels but since RoS came out he’s definitely surpassed Chris Evans’ cable knit sweater.
aww,fefysn4,t1_fefykiv,1579069834.0,Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  It’s amazing what people will “farm” in exchange for cash.  I remember a over a decade ago when the only farmers I had to worry about were gold farmers in WoW.
aww,feffmrg,t3_eos5gy,1579055313.0,I feel like Adam Driver has become Keanu: Millennial Edition.  And I’m not mad about it.
aww,fe67ylq,t3_enuv0a,1578883784.0,Someone with some talent around here needs to write a sea shanty about Maggie.
SkincareAddiction,fe43gt4,t1_fe3lnmn,1578855432.0,Hah I remember as a child using half the container of my mother Shalimar body powder in an attempt to give myself grey hair.  I smelled fantastic though!
StarWars,fe25g60,t1_fe1332j,1578834707.0,I don’t know that it’s his skills I’m usually “appreciating”...

marvelstudios,fdt58iv,t3_emw4kb,1578712079.0,Someone get his thumbs so he can’t snap!
sysadmin,fdq8b9y,t1_fdpyq79,1578659017.0,CEOs of global companies with employees in the thousands can’t be expected to do the same.  However I will note that my old CEO was sad when the company grew so large that he wasn’t able to know everyone the way he used to.
AskReddit,fdpepcx,t1_fdozi8s,1578626710.0,"Yes, the purple dildo triple fucktangle today was an unexpected sexual NSFW for me today in a subreddit that typically has its posts marked as NSFW for being memes that are insensitive but not typically pornogrphic"
sysadmin,fdp3tyj,t1_fdn9m7i,1578619351.0,Most CEOs don’t know how to contact anyone at the help desk without emailing somebody.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fdorema,t1_fdnuo4w,1578611201.0,Is anybody ever expecting a triple purple dildo fucktangle?

LadyBoners,fdlssku,t3_elulp1,1578531643.0,He reminds me a lot of Douglas Booth.
LadyBoners,fditqrg,t3_el6znq,1578450841.0,He makes high waisted pants look so good.
Youniqueamua,fdgz4ef,t1_fdf0e4k,1578411825.0,She definitely shopped her waist.  Look at her elbow on the right side of the photo.  It’s warped wider from her trying to nip it in.
Sandwiches,fdgsxhh,t1_fdf57ja,1578407502.0,Yet they seem to be OK with people posting their “homemade” charcuterie boards...
LadyBoners,fdehvlj,t1_fde6mrm,1578339367.0,Yeah. He needs his hair as it is now. The standard Marine high and tight doesn’t help him at all.
boston,fd6j3a1,t3_ek3bww,1578191811.0,This might be the most Boston thing to ever Boston.
BeautyGuruChatter,fd6iyao,t1_fd6b45t,1578191750.0,Just use the Ulta dividing line...  nothing more expensive than Morphe and Colourpop.
movies,fcjwjui,t1_fcjlj2k,1577708163.0,Wow that’s a nice bit of gatekeeping.
cats,fcjktlb,t3_ehfgx3,1577691688.0,She’s so beautiful!
movies,fcjk66h,t1_fcjk02k,1577690873.0,"Nope, it didn’t.  Were you not implying that the 30 something outboomered the 48 yo lady (me - the boomer according to you)?  If that wasn’t your meaning then I have indeed been whooshed."
movies,fcjjo7r,t1_fcjdv15,1577690263.0,Not a boomer.  Born in the middle of Gen X (also labeled as the “Slacker generation” by the Boomers). We were screwed over by the Boomers too.  The whole damn world has been screwed over by that selfish generation.
SkincareFlatlays,fcj92hj,t1_f9tm10l,1577680316.0,Thanks for the tip.  I’ll look for that next time.
movies,fcj8pd1,t1_fcj7z3f,1577680087.0,"Just don’t “OK Boomer” me.  I’m not that old!  

Also puzzled as to why you think being a 30 something millennial is “old ass”."
movies,fcj7usf,t1_fcj7dfw,1577679466.0,"Younger?  I’m 48.  I like musicals.  Just not bad ones.  Give me The Sound of Music or My Fair Lady any day of the week over any schmaltzy garbage from AndrewLloyd Webber or semi corny like The Greatest Showman (which pains me to say, as I love Hugh Jackman)."
cats,fcj7ebf,t3_eh8t7j,1577679120.0,I feel like this needs to be the next evolution of the old lady Halloween costume for toddlers.  Old Cat Lady.
movies,fcj78hj,t1_fcj6w3s,1577679004.0,"Yeh no.  These were all mostly people from my hometown that I keep up with on the dreaded Facebook.  I myself still haven’t seen it as it’s not my cup of tea, but anyone that I knew that had, could not shut up about it."
movies,fcj6uia,t1_fcj60lp,1577678729.0,"No, tremendous seems accurate to me if speaking of word of mouth.  My social media was littered with friends commenting on loving that movie.

I haven’t seen a single person on my social media say anything nice about Cats though.  Mostly joining in on the beating of the already dead horse."
fixtagram,fci602c,t1_fcfvclm,1577658168.0,Not to mention she now seems to have the feet of Shaq.
LadyBoners,fc9zxkn,t1_fc9qfxl,1577560729.0,His whole Insta is a giant thirst trap.  And he totally knows what he’s doing to us.
aww,fc6nfcf,t1_fc652pp,1577484735.0,I call mine a muppet too.  But it’s because he looks more like a Fizzigig.  https://imgur.com/gallery/5TEMY7F
