ItHadToBeBrazil,ffk60a0,t1_ffk0xya,1580017004.0,To be honest I don't think it's so much about the names as it is about the attitude. People who think and act like the US is America (not only part of it) and treat the rest of us like the polite neighbor (Canada) and the lesser people that are renting your backyard. The condescending and entitled posture that some people have is just downright infuriating.

Yeah.  Lots of people on this thread who've obviously never shoved large things up their rear.  Which is fine, whatever floats your boat.  But don't extrapolate based on pop culture jokes about gay sex.  

The anus is pretty damn stretchy.  Throw in some muscle relaxants like this guy was using to drug them and unless he was particularly violent or using large objects, I wouldn't expect the victims to realize they'd been penetrated. 

Usually, anal sex when the sphincter is relaxed causes neither damage or pain the next day.  If there is any discomfort, it's usually like an overworked muscle from exercise rather than straight up ""ahhh my bum is burning!"" and I wouldn't expect a man who hasn't had receptive anal sex before to necessarily recognize or process the feeling."
