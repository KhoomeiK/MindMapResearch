apexlegends,fgq667j,t1_fgp9wb8,1581018604.0,"To be honest, I disagree with a lot of that list, but what I disagree the most is Wattson and Pathfinder being Neutral Good.

Pathfinder is the essence of neutrality in this thing... he kills when he have to kill, and he helps when he have to help. Not because he enjoys doing it, but because those are the rules of the Apex Games. So it would be Lawful Neutral.

Wattson on the other hand.. I'd put her on the Lawful Evil spot. We should never forget she was the one who designed the ring, making it possible for the blood sport to exist in the first place. Sure, she did so to help her father, so in her head she's doing the right thing, but it's essentially an evil thing she did.

Bangalore was with the space Nazis (IMC) so she was definitely Lawful Evil. But since she left the IMC and now play in the Apex Games only for herself, I'd say she's Neutral but some people point to some of her answers and voicelines that indicate she actually enjoy killing in the arena, and that would be evil imo . And Wraith is definitely Chaotic Good."

Mirage on the other hand, not really. He's definitely chaotic, but being in the games for fame a money is not exactly an evil thing. Never saw anything that would indicate that Mirage takes joy in killing in the arena. I'd say he's Chaotic Neutral.
