Basically all three of those settings presuppose a human empire that nukes itself and consequentially loses contact with all their colonies, before building itself back up into 4 factions, mostly based on geographic proximity (though America Incorporated includes the UK and Australia). So I've made every one of them into a civ and locked all the Next War and SMAC factions into spawning on just Sol and Deneb respectively, to simulate both of those games playing out to a planetside victory before reintroducing themselves as the would-be inheritors of the recently fallen World Government of Earth.

It's kind of funny how they all seem to follow their own little themes regardless of how things end up. New Earth plays like a slightly more militant UNE- activly defending their alien allies and such- before abruptly becoming xenophobic in the mid-game, the Human Hive is always tiny and friendless, but they persevere despite the odds well into late-game, the Pan-Asiatic People's Republic by contrast ends up bloated and powerful, but sometimes after just one bad war collapse into barbarism and piracy.
