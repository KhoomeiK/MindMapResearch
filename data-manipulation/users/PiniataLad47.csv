writing,fftzn0v,t3_ev2iz6,1580231227.0,"You mentioned being inspired by anime earlier, so...

In my experience, anime fights (Ok I havent watched that many anime, but the one with the most fight scenes I've seen are JoJo and Kill la Kill), just like many in western media, are heavy in symbolism and dramatic phrases.

If you havent seen Kill La Kill, skip this, as it contains spoilers/may ruin the show a little bit. >!Essentially, each battle that isnt just a short slap is *always* in some way about overcoming a weakness, whether internal or external- which I feel is how youd write a fight scene-focus on internal thoughts.!<

Many battle-scenes contain heavy symbolism- try to include that, it adds an interesting layer. What you could also do is realise that most fights, whether in Marvel Films, anime or real life- are all about endurance. Romans fought their enemies in tight formation until someone gave in from exhaustion and ran away. I'm serious, most fights and wars are about that- and victory isn't just about beating the hell out of your adversery, it's about the physical and mental strain of never, ever giving up. That is what makes fights interesting. Split second decisions about prioritising saving or taking a life are super impactful, and are worth including with supernatural elements especially."

The Nazi manifesto (25 point plan), as well as plenty of nationalist and racist policies, initially also had a fair few about taking all land from businesses and instituting full employment. Obviously most of these never got implemented, but the party started out with a lot of socialist concepts, such as land confiscation. (Well, we'd associate these with socialism today is what I mean)
