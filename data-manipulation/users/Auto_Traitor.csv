funny,ff4d5aa,t1_ff4b69c,1579560801.0,"Being excited about food is vastly different than the food having a psychoactive affect. Your emotional states about the food are not the same as a drug causing psychoactive affects that change your perception of reality. 

Way to go, you don't understand what you're talking about. Words have meaning, and when speaking of science, like biochemistry, the definitions are immutable. You can't just put quotes on something to feel correct. A kid being excited about candy is not equal to a psychoactive affect enacted by ingesting sugar, which doesn't exist, which you are claiming does. Sugar is not a stimulant. Period.



By the way, making rational arguments will help you understand your point better as well as help prevent you from making false claims like you are. Why don't you focus on that, learning about things, instead of spouting lies and insults because you don't understand enough to reply intellectually."
Documentaries,ff46sig,t1_ff42k3a,1579556787.0,"It's described as such, but it's not as extreme as it sounds. Yeah, that nerdy kid has trouble making ""normal friends"" because his main interests differ vastly from theirs, in clinical terms it's unhealthy because it affects relationships.

funny,ff463zl,t1_ff3wrb2,1579556366.0,"You know what you just described? Fucking food and energy storage. You're the one who's full of shit. It has absolutely zero effects of a stimulant. Sugar isn't psychoactive you fucking imbecile. You said yourself, ""natural kid tendencies"", so tell me, because I'm full of sugar and have plenty of available energy, I'm speeding now, right?


There are facts, and there are bullshit claims made by idiots like you who make false deductions. Just because you have a good energy source available in your body doesn't mean you're suddenly working in overdrive. Stimulants overclock your metabolism and quicken thought processes. 


Sugar as a stimulant has been categorically and factually disproven but, no, let's listen to the dumbass who says digesting inert food is like taking a drug because they believe it!"

science,feeram3,t1_feek29a,1579039531.0,"People can choose not to, yes, as accidental events of evolution brought us to higher level of thought. Below a certain thought threshold yet to be exactly discerned, animals will act compulsively on their respective instinctual codes. The watering hole wasn't ""decided"" upon, it was a biological imperative enacted in response to stimuli.

We are something more than animals, yes, but asserting ""I could choose not to feed or water"" is the meaningless statement here. Have you ever been to verge of death by something you yourself could fix? Are you going to? No. Your immediate reasoning likely being either ""I don't want to,"" or ""why just for some idiots online?"" So your higher processes have prevented you from triggering survival code that overrides them.

Now here's the rub, how can you say those thoughts are born of your own free will and not born of your (accidental!) evolutionary hardwiring to stave off death?

You simply can't unless you go all the way to test the power of your mind against your code. The battle can only be ""won"" by terminating oneself, which of course, ""is ridiculous to prove a point"", an instinctual thought."
science,feeng0p,t1_feekd73,1579037298.0,"But all evidence supports that *everything* is accidental, born of the chaos of the universe. Until an organism reaches a really high threshold of thought processes, the only true ""manipulative force"" is natural selection.

science,feemmhf,t1_feehz92,1579036829.0,"The point being, if complex organisms are a byproduct or construct, if you will, the implication is that bacteria are manipulating the higher order thought itself for upkeep of their defense systems.

We benefit from each other because the bacteria influenced our evolution first, not because we decided.

MurderedByWords,fdzu0dd,t1_fdzmpp4,1578795761.0,"It's because your statement doesn't apply, an individual across the globe winning a couple million couldn't even dent the situation. And the premise becomes nonsensical when you amend it with a necessity to give it to a few corrupt people. We spend this money to subvert their government with our will, can you imagine if our goal was **actually** to help rather than saying it was, but instead focusing on profits back home? A true comparison doesn't even start to apply until you talk humanitarian aid on the same operative scale as the military. 

Your argument is highly disingenuous, you can't contrast a full scale hostile military occupation with a few people donating money and conclude the argument to help instead is wrong.

One millionaire walking through Baghdad to help would likely be fucked, no shit. It's not comparable to the country as a whole deciding to spend the war budget as a peace fund.

Sending thousands of people with a budget of 700 million dollars PER DAY to help with food, health, and infrastructure rather than bullets, bombs, and orders under threat of death. We can obviously afford the cost, so where would these countries be now if we'd helped instead of harmed?
