To increase your chances you have to follow the events on the suns surface closely. Coronal mass ejections in our planets direction almost always result in Norther lights.    
Now, these CME's are produced by sunspots, and right now, the sun is in a phase called ""solar minimum"". Meaning, there are little to no solar flares to be had.

No, people who still stick to him are the ones, that would rather die in a fire, than to admit they were wrong. It would hurt their fragile ego too much to admit publicly on the internet, or to friends and family, that they made a mistake. As well as fear, that others might disagree. It's a group mentality: ""My buddy Tucker is probably still believing in him, and I don't want to lose my best drinking pal.""    
    
So they consciously block out any negative news about it, and think about something else. When confronted about it, they get aggressive, since they know they're wrong, but can't act on it.    
    
At least, that's how I could bring myself to do something like that. Hell, I've deleted several of my comments, and some Reddit accounts, just because I talked myself into a corner. But rather than admitting my mistake, I made it worse, or ran from it."
