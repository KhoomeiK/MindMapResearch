depression,fcj6mxt,t1_fci3ag2,1577678571.0,"i don’t even know how to explain the energy of my house. it’s very sedentary and quiet and almost tense. meals are just us eating, we go to our own rooms, usually i watch tv with my parents. its only when we’re all together that the silence just becomes so unbearably loud. it makes trying to talk feel kind of pointless.
maybe i’ll just try to be the initiator like you’re saying though. it would be better than how things are now"
