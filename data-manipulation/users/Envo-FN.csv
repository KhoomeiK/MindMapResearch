It was NOT designed to help people with 40ping +, there isnt much epic can do for that. Thats literally just where you live, and they arent going to add a 40ms delay. Its supposed to help people with 20-30 ping be able to compete with 0-5 pingers."

IllegalLifeProTips,fdj7xj8,t1_fdi17pe,1578460996.0,"I used to get migraines right after a strange blind spot appeared in one of my eyes, basically a void of nothingness in my vision. Is that a symptom of this? Got this 2-3 times one spring and never again so it doesnt seem like a disorder"
aww,fdealrk,t1_fddquz6,1578334834.0,What is so bad about letting the kid buy it himself? Maybe he wanted to and would rather spend his own money on the dog rather than the parents? Maybe the kid is happy with what he has in life and thought it’d be a good idea to spread some love?
aww,fdczqyj,t1_fdczlwi,1578289252.0,Exaggeration? This isnt that hard bro
aww,fdczckg,t1_fdcx9jn,1578288874.0,"Definitely made me smile, but no. Cant laugh much rn, got my tonsils out recently and it causes a great deal of pain. But good point, its not like anyones has ever said ‘LMFAO’ or something along the lines of and not actually LMFAO’d, right?"
aww,fdcz8x2,t1_fdcxvhe,1578288779.0,"Sure, but just because it isn’t 100% ‘responsible’ doesn’t mean it was the absolute wrong thing to do, as you made it seem"
aww,fdcz6xx,t1_fdcynys,1578288730.0,Absolutely
aww,fdcwjr1,t1_fdcrfwr,1578286391.0,What about this says he is depressed? What says the dog is being treated poorly? Those are some very bold claims to make given the small amount of information you have.
aww,fdcwb4m,t1_fdchmsa,1578286184.0,"Parent replied in a similar comment, the bed was on sale"
aww,fdcw9js,t1_fdctzay,1578286146.0,What about this told you that the parent forced the kid to buy the dog bed?
aww,fdcw6n1,t1_fdcon2r,1578286077.0,"This is some of the most profoundly flawed logic I’ve ever come across. People replace perfectly functional computer parts with better ones all the time, same with the majority of household items. Sure an item being broken reinforces the thought of replacement, but just because it isnt broken doesnt make replacement economically stupid."
aww,fdcvxke,t1_fdcm8e5,1578285862.0,"Yeah, this comment hits it pretty well. I’m the older brother of the nice ass kid and she’s got like at least 2 other beds around the house. This one wasn’t necessary, but it was evidently appreciated"
aww,fdcvoim,t1_fdchlby,1578285649.0,"Boi get ur ass outa here LMFAO

GiftedConversation,fczahwk,t3_ejfrl5,1578096985.0,"I am constantly restraining myself from relating things brought up in casual, average-competence  conversation to far more abstract and complex ideas due to the fact that the people around me will fail to understand what i’m talking about, and how the occasional usage of ‘big words’ scares them. Very limiting. I have a couple friends, 1-2 and mostly online that I can share an intellectual discussion with and it feels like i’m finally able to breathe"

Definitely not pointlessly gendered. Probably going to get downvoted for not supporting the obvious echo chamber we have here"
teenagers,fc5kya4,t3_eg5ceq,1577460378.0,Thats really not all that funny
unpopularopinion,fc10wnb,t3_eff41k,1577305087.0,"It should be equality of opportunity rather than plainly enforced equality. A man and a woman apply for a job, the woman should not have a greater chance of getting the job because she’s a woman, but rather because her individual qualities better fit the job than that of the man."
techsupport,fbzdcgy,t1_fbzcxjx,1577242942.0,How would i check for that? Tried updating my drivers earlier and it said i had the latest version. Anything else i should do? Thank you regardless :D
