politics,ff7kc6e,t1_ff7j47x,1579651588.0,Reminds me of a question someone asked Bernie about how he was the spoiler for the 1988 Vermont house representative election. He got more votes than the Democratic candidate so technically the Democrat was the spoiler in that election.
politics,ff7ctex,t1_ff6xz6z,1579646574.0,That IMO is one of the best things about America (as well as other democracies). Politicians should expect to be criticized and made fun of. Trump is probably the first president to ever get offended by a joke made at his expense.

edit: if I didn't state my opinion nobody would have ever corrected me. I live in a very conservative area and my only consistent source of liberal discussion is through the internet. I would have never known anything about hormone therapy and would go around being ignorant of my ignorance."

politics,ff55zti,t1_ff54y8w,1579581201.0,"IMO as a temporary fix depending on the sport not much has to change. 

For track and field sports they can compete with their respective genders and have their records simply be recorded as records separate from the biological sex.

For team sports make open teams that allow anyone to be in them, and a closed team if there is a significant number that chooses the a team closed to a specific sex. Something like that wouldn't be perfect, but I'm sure for some sports it could work just fine."

Both create situations for the individual that changes their situations in today's world. 

I would love to be able to ride the Space Mountain roller coaster without closing my eyes for half of the ride but can't because I was born with an unfair disadvantage, and if I used that disadvantage to stop the ride from having any flashing lights that would ruin the ride for other riders. That would be unfair to everyone else otherwise known as the majority of costumers.  

A trans person would love to compete in sports with the people they identify as, but can't because they born in a way that prevents that from happening. It would be unfair to use their differences in biology to dominate the rest of the competition otherwise know as the majority."

Again going back to disfranchisement. People need to learn who they are before they make such massive non-reversible decisions. A lot of people have identity issues when they are children, and as they grow older they begin to understand more about themselves."
politics,ff524s3,t3_erop31,1579578167.0,"I don't understand why people would ever think it is fair for a biological born male to be on a female sports team. While people are trying to allow a handful of trans people feel comfortable they are absolutely disenfranchising every female born person. 

A good analogy I have works with my personal experience with epilepsy (something I have no choice in having unlike hormone therapy with trans people). As an epileptic every time I go to a concert, ride a theme park ride, or even watch tv I risk having a seizure. Do you think it would be fair if I went to a concert and told the band they can't use their special effects because I have epilepsy?

Trans people aren't the only people that feel disfranchised especially when going to school. Life isn't fair. Get over it."

worldnews,ff42hci,t1_ff3t5fq,1579554105.0,"I worked part time for a cleaning service in college. The person that trained me for certain sites would mention how he would occasionally spend extra time doing things like unscrewing the window blinds and vent covers to make sure they were pristine. 

I was getting paid minimum wage for an hour's work at each site. No way in hell would I do anything beyond what my job asked for and I would certainly not spend a second longer working than I was supposed to. 

I personally think he did those things because he hated spending time with his wife and kids, and working a second job as a janitor was the better of the two options."

wholesomememes,femv63n,t1_fempibt,1579270456.0,"That leads to the other big problem. For most people their work self is far different than their home self. For most jobs the employees are paid to be nice to costumers, non-combative to coworkers, and to dress well.
But when they are at home they might dress like hobos, swear up a storm, rant about politics, masturbate to kinky porn, and most definitely bitch about the people they deal with at their job.

news,fdi4dwv,t3_elh7gz,1578435526.0,"One time after having a seizure I woke up with my first ever dislocated shoulder. The only thought in my mind was not about how much pain I was in or the fact that I woke up completely alone at 1 a.m. but about how much the E.R. bill would cost. It wasn't until a roommate found me and convinced me to go to the hospital that I gave in. 

A similar event happened later when I was living alone. I woke up one morning covered in my own puke with a dislocated shoulder, and took me several hours to give in and get someone to drive me to the E.R.  

I was in college for the first one and was too poor to afford even insured E.R. visits. and the second was a right after college when I was in between insurance policies. If it happened literally two days later it wouldn't have been a problem.  The post seizure brain was probably part of my lack of logic in those situations."
