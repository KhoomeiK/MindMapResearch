Why did the cat not try to eat the middle ball and get tangled up in all the wiring, so it's like some sort of corset around his middle? Then flee and scramble into a hole in the underside of the sofa. Where he would then somehow knit the Newton's Cradle to the springs of the sofa and wowr forlornly until the sofa has been pulled apart to retrieve him. At which point he will turn to liquid and slide out, slinking out of the back door with one last look behind him with a, ""fuck you, you bastard"" face."

Really with regard to cruelty to cats it depends on your home/neighborhood/country and dependant on the cat. 
My cats roamed inside and out, but I lived out in the country with no major roads. My mother's cat chose never to place a whisker outside, she lived in the suburbs. 

Perhaps it's only safe to say it's unwise to make blanket statements based on only your own opinion."
