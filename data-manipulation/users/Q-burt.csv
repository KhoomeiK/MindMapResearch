Paranormal,ffgn1ur,t3_eteqz4,1579910052.0,"My dad died from a heart attack, too. My sister was visiting my grandma (dad's mom) and she saw both my dad and my grandpa. They would walk into and out of the room from an invisible doorway. Dad was wearing jeans and his favorite maroon polo shirt he's had since we were kids, grandpa was wearing his standard attire. Dad and grandpa had passed just about a year apart. My sister said they both looked to be about in their prime years. I believe you and your dad had a message for you. Seek out his message."

AskReddit,fdlcqlo,t3_eluch8,1578521232.0,"I had my colon removed, during the surgery, they gave me an epidural. When I woke up the next day, they wanted to get me out of bed to walk. The epidural was not working for the pain, but sure made my legs not work. I was being held up by two nurses while my legs tried to collapse under me, causing the incision they'd made to remove my colon (similar to a c-section, and for reference, I'm a male) was being pulled apart. That was pretty painful. They had to replace the epidural and then have me try to walk again later. I did later also have some sepsis when my bowel they had resected perforated in a freak accident where my small bowel had kind of flopped over on the resected part. That was pretty uncomfortable, too. Was getting morphine all night. Didn't work."
