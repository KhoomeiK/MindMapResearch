marriageadvice,ffhz5ab,t3_etm3o5,1579959977.0,He sounds like the kind of person who would rather stick to being loud and wrong than admit that he’s harming you with this opinion. For me this would be a deal breaker.
TrueCrime,ffd6s5l,t3_esu506,1579814526.0,"Dianne Downs is a good one. She did LOADS of interviews whilst she was free and they couldn’t charge her and they’re completly insane. Every few years she comes up for parole and you get a new video of her being completely nuts. She’s probably one of the shittiest people I can think of.

I also read up and follow the murder of Farah Fratta too, it was the 90s and the whole story behind it with her shitbag ex husband Robert Fratta just fascinated me and makes me so sad at the same time. It’s not really a ‘classic’ but it’s one that I binge research a lot."

adhdwomen,ff8y9gg,t3_es8wkm,1579699932.0,"I managed to get diagnosed very quickly, but I already had a Tourette syndrome diagnosis. I’m currently having a lot of trouble getting an appointment to get my medication sorted out. I’m in Nottingham but I get treated in Leicester as it’s where I was diagnosed when I lived there last year and the waiting list is smaller. The waiting list in Nottingham is a year and a half, as I’m already in with Leicester it makes sense for me to stay there whilst I am also on the Nottingham list. My wait for my adhd appointment in Leicester was less than 4 months, but again, I think this is because of my TS and I was experiencing really bad depression and anxiety that was suspected to be due to my undiagnosed ADHD so I think they bumped me up. I have a history of OCD and phobias too so that probably made my wait shorter.

There is a little known rule with the NHS that you are allowed to choose where you are treated for your initial appointment, so if you can find a place with a smaller waiting list it might be worth trying that. Be persistent (which is fucking hard, I hate it) because they will try and persuade you to wait, but you have the right to choose and if it benefits you use this option. 

[Information](https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/patient-choice/Documents/patient-choice-leaflet.pdf) about the right to choose your own care"
relationship_advice,ff7kuwv,t3_es2fnr,1579651951.0,"The perfect man for you is a guy who throws his farts into your face? Really? 

Honestly if this is the case you should settle for someone who is almost perfect for you. Perfection isn’t everything."
PublicFreakout,ff6zsml,t3_erzu5k,1579638259.0,I’d happily watch the movie of that
