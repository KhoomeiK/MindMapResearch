ProRevenge,fgtq4s7,t1_fgtnfhf,1581107903.0,"Absolutely. Feelings are more important than reality. The value of a plant vase is determined by the amount of feelings I charge it with. So if you destroy some plants you deserve to lose your job, your home, the love of your sons and have your life ruined because I decided that the vase plant is more important, because I have memories and feeling tied to it and you are supposed to know it, you are required to know it. There is no such things as ""objective value"". If you destroy a vase the right punishment is prison because that vase mean something special to me, and what is special to me has to be recognized as special by everybody, because that's how reality works.
But hey, since My family suffered a terrible tragedy FUCK YOU, I can ruin your life. Is not like something bad ever happened to anybody else but me and my sister, we are the only one who ever suffered.You rip up plants? I can threat you with my aikido shit and you have to shut the fuck up."

WTF,fgt8bwb,t1_fgso2q3,1581100889.0,"a lot more people could live off any cruise ship. the biggest cruise ship costs 1.5 billion dollars, way more that this boat. 
How many people can u feed with a thousand dollars? Why don't you complain about the hundreds of millions of people who chose to get an Iphone instead of getting a shitty android phone and give 800$ to charity?  How is that different? Capitalism sure is broken, but I prefer when the super rich spend money instead of hiding them in some trust fund."
WTF,fgqrb1z,t1_fgqf5xr,1581029817.0,"Put it this way: It grants a living for a good amount of people. Grom the people who designed it, to the people who built it, the crew, mechanics, insurance brokers plus tens of thousand of dollars every day it spend parked in various ports. It's just a small ecosystem.

How is it  different from any other cruise ship?"

justneckbeardthings,ffu9900,t3_ev50xd,1580237155.0,I like the double layer on this one: a commentary on  neckbeards using the same form a neckbeard would use. I don't know where to direct my contempt: the content of the meme or the meme itself? It's like this subreddit folded on itself.

depression,ffgvamt,t3_etjf92,1579915960.0,"I get what you mean. But really... why does your heart needs to shatter all over again? I mean, nothing really happened, it's  just a text. It seems like you get cought up in past events in an unhealthy way. 2013 was 7 years ago. You should put your ex and your feelings aside for just a moment and ask yourself: ""why something that should just be a distant memory still hurts?"" I mean... it's really the definition of depression: this continuous rumination over the past. 

I'm just trying to redirect your attention from the ancient ex's text message to more important considerations regarding the way you deal with past events and live your present."

depression,ff6w5wf,t3_eryh09,1579636126.0,"Find something else before quitting. Try some counseling/ therapy maybe? It can help you make the right decision. Why exactly does this job makes you depressed? Do you already know what other job you might prefer? Is it the job in itself or is it the colleagues you don't like? Is it really the job that is depressing or is the depression that is making your job unbearable?

What other job are you qualified for? Are you thinking about changing career path or getting the same job somewhere else? 

You see, there's a bunch of things you need to consider. No one can answer your question if you don't even offer some kind of context."
