puppy101,ffj0uuk,t3_etrljz,1579987558.0,"From a quick look at your last few posts, you're about 20 years old?

You have to step up. Get online and educate yourself about positive training. Watch Zak George, Kikopup, Simpawtico, etc., on YouTube to get a general idea. Do not EVER smack your dog or yell at him. All it will do is prevent bonding and increase the risk of fear aggression later. Start again.

If' he's really only 8 weeks old, even if he's actually 12 weeks old, I would look into rehoming him. Go to a good no-kill shelter and explain your situation. The sooner the better, because the key socialisation window ends at around 16 weeks of age. This is when they learn all of the foundations for their future behaviour, so it's very important that if you do rehome him, you do it soon rather than waiting and thinking about it.

If you do want to keep him, you will need to take full responsibility for his training and not depend on your family/mother. You are right that he doesn't understand. It's your job to help him. 

The first thing you can do is Google ""how to stop puppy biting""."
findapath,ffhkhvh,t3_etk29q,1579939470.0,"Have you tried applying for jobs in vegan restaurants or going to culinary school/doing an apprenticeship and becoming a chef, working at events in food trucks, or anything along these lines? You're only 28. You don't need to have everything sorted by 30. It's a fallacy and the fear you are experiencing is completely caused by societal pressures and this concept that everything has to be done by a certain age. Don't pressure yourself to Have Everything Sorted within a certain time frame. Life is an exploration. There are a million different paths you could take. 

At this current point in your life, you realise that you don't want an office job. You like being on your feet and doing something more hands-on. Even if it's not food that you build a career in, use what you've discovered about yourself as a starting point. The alternative to food doesn't have to be office jobs. Just take some time to do some research and think things through. Come up with a plan and pursue it and see where it leads you. 

Food trucks are no different to most businesses. Just because there are a lot of elements and variables involved, doesn't mean you can't make a success of it. You just have to decide whether you're willing to take the risk. Any businesses is a risk. Nothing is ever guaranteed to succeed. And to be honest, I'd recommend getting yourself into a daily situation that you do actually enjoy enough to keep doing it, first. Otherwise you just end up placing a ton of pressure on The Dream. What is to say you can't find yourself a job you enjoy and still explore the food truck route when you're 35? 40? 45? At the point where you have more life experience, hopefully more food experience, and you've had time to financially plan for this kind of exploration. 

Finally - what about vegan food blogging? What about creating a youtube channel with vegan recipes? This is something you can explore with minimal cost and you'll be able to get feedback on your dishes when people make them and leave comments on how they liked it."

selfimprovement,ff4fvs5,t3_erfaax,1579562628.0,"Everyone has a certain system working against them, and yours is that  privilege enables you. 

To put it frankly? 

Life will bring you struggles. What you are going through now is an example of it. For most people, their greatest challenge is overcoming themselves. I'd say that's definitely the case for you right now. You'll face other struggles in the future too. 

Volunteer. Don't roll your eyes. Go and do it. Volunteer abroad and get out of your comfort zone. Volunteer at home and get out of your comfort zone. Whatever. Find something that resonates. Try animal shelters, homeless shelters, community gardens, helping the elderly, something political, activist groups. It will open your mind and give you a greater sense of the world beyond yourself. 

Ask your parents to cut you off. Be a grown up and make your own decision. Or, keep taking their money and invest it, and support yourself through a job. Whatever it might be. Develop self-discipline. Even if you're a teenager, you can still do this. 

You'll learn that nobody will do things for you in life, even if it looks like they will. You have everyone doing everything for you in the financial and enabling sense. Yet the outcome is that you are left not liking yourself. Nobody else can make you like who you are or solve your own personal challenges, and that's the irony."
selfimprovement,ff3ly1t,t1_ff1xyzj,1579543867.0,"Or is it that we only hear about their struggles because they are successful/prominent/famous/inspirational?

I'd love to know what he is once you DNA test him!"
dogs,ff34sl5,t1_ff20tkj,1579533674.0,"I have the same perspective. 

I'm a dog walker, and there is this one dog who will wait for me in the mornings and won't budge from the door until I've arrived. He won't even eat his breakfast. It's as if he's thinking that if he moves or eats, somehow I won't arrive, haha. This started the second day I walked him. It doesn't mean he doesn't love his owner or isn't happy with his owner. It doesn't mean he loves me more. It literally means that he had fun with me the first time and is down for enjoying more of the same. I do think dogs get attached. But I'm also pretty damn sure that if I am replaced by someone he finds equally fun, he'll be equally happy and waiting for them by the door. 

Same thing with grace periods. I think they are a great idea. It's impossible to know how a dog (or even a puppy from a breeder) will fit into your life until they are actually in your life. I think grace periods are really important, and if the adopter/owner helps them with training and other things, this is an even bigger benefit to the dog, even if that does not end up being their forever home."
dogs,ff2ufgl,t1_ff0a1qv,1579524588.0,"Out of interest - what was their behaviour like in general? Were they fearful at all? Did they walk well on a leash? Did they have any issues outside of house training and hormonal behaviour (humping, marking, etc.)? 

I'm strongly considering adopting an older puppy or young adult dog, but I'm cautious because I'm a dog walker by profession, and every single adult dog I walk has one issue or another. Whether it's poor recall, pulling on the leash, separation anxiety, excessive barking, fear aggression, or other stuff. 

It makes me nervous that these issues can't be rectified. I'd love to know your thoughts and what you did? And also how you went about choosing your dogs and knowing they were right for you?"
puppy101,ff2shod,t1_ff0sn78,1579522226.0,"Try little bits at a time, if you haven't already. He could be vomiting due to anxiety, or could be anxious because he'll know he'll vomit - or both things could be feeding into each other!

Try taking him in the car and just running the engine, while calmly rewarding him for any second of calm behaviour. Then you can progress to say pulling out of the driveway/car park and back again. Then progress to a short drive around the block, and so on.

If you have no luck, you might want to see a vet if you haven't already. They may be able to provide something to help.

Also, if you don't already do this, try popping him in a covered travel crate facing you, or using those visor things for kids on the windows for now (so that he's not watching lots of cars flashing by). Puppies tend to get travel sickness more than adult dogs because their ears aren't fully developed yet and this impacts their balance obviously. So what you want to try to do is make travel positive for him so that he learns to associate travel with positive things once he's an adult.

You can also try things like not feeding him until after you've come home from riding in the car, if possible. i.e. avoid giving him breakfast then taking him straight out in the car to a park or whatever.

You can also provide a chew toy that's only for use in the car. It might provide distraction, keep his eyes off the windows, and help him to settle, as well as helping that positive association.

One last tip is popping all four of your windows down a half inch. That helps to balance out the air pressure in the car and can help your pup with sickness."
dogs,feuf0k3,t1_fetr5ds,1579385932.0,"Again, super reassuring! Thank you!

So basically, when the dog pulls, you say ""walk nicely"" then turn around? Then repeat until the dog can walk nicely?

Do you mark or reward when the dog walks nicely too, or just focus on teaching through changing directions until the dog understands?"
dogs,fetkffa,t1_fesqwx6,1579376339.0,">Let him sniff the treat, lead him around by the nose. If he's jumping, the treat is too high up. Lower it so that it's at his nose level. Just let him follow it for a bit before giving it to him. If he's not paying attention to it, put it closer to his nose and move it more slowly - moving the lure too quickly or too far away from the dog is a common misstep in luring. It's not luring at all, in fact, it becomes just dangling treats away from their face!

I really like the idea of this and think this could work. It feels like he needs help understanding even how to walk next to me at all, and I hadn't thought about doing it this way, then gradually working my way out of the apartment/building. This is awesome. Thank you so much. 

&#x200B;

> With practice, he'll realize that walks aren't ""run around willy nilly"" time, but ""treats for walking next to you"" time. 

You put it perfectly and this will really help, for me to keep this in mind! It's hard sometimes because his owner focuses more on physically tiring him out so that he'll be calmer at home, but it's impossible for me to tire his dog out at the park if I can't walk him to the park without getting my arm near pulled off. What you've said here will help me focus on the purpose of walks as the pup sees it, because I definitely don't want him to think walks are ""run around willy nilly""! You hit the nail on the head."

dogs,fetf3qn,t1_fet8pu3,1579374802.0,"This is reassuring. So you'd say it's possible to get him walking well on leash for me even with reinforcement for pulling from his owner? i.e. He should be able to contextualise?

I really like this dog a lot, and he fits well into my daily bookings, so I don't want to drop his owner as a client if I can help it. I just want to get him walking well so that I can safely keep him on!"
dogs,fetenjw,t1_ferwmji,1579374642.0,">Have you tried working - just - on focus and engagement outside? If the dog is soooooo distracted outside that it can't pay attention, you'll never be able to teach it anything. Work on eye contact and offered attention in distracting environments.

This is a good idea. I've been rewarding eye contact for sure. Can you tell me a bit more about offered attention? Basically him looking at me and engaging with me around distractions?"
dogs,fet97m5,t1_ferueno,1579372899.0,"Thanks so much for this advice. Yep you're dead right! His owner walks him, but he doesn't interact with him much on walks. More just lets him off the leash to barrel into other dogs, and considers it a success if he finds a boisterous dog to play with. So yeah, there's definitely a vibe of him being super over-excited when I arrive.

The main issue is that the owner lives in an apartment and works from home, so it's hard for me to play indoors with the dog. But what I can try is getting some of his initial energy out by running with him for the first part of the walk, or something like this. Thank you again, this is really useful!"
smallbusiness,ferliqo,t3_eqaq1m,1579355465.0,"In general?

The first year of business should be setup and experimenting. You have to test test test. Success is literally stumbling on something that clicks then doubling, tripling, quadrupling down on that for as long as you can ride the wave. Then you grow from constantly improving the winning formula you've found.

I'm wondering just reading your post whether the issue is that your target market and food type is a bad match. Are you targeting office workers at lunch? I don't work in an office, but if I did, I think I'd be hesitant to buy Asian food or burgers in the middle of the day. Messy, too filling, wouldn't want to eat it at my desk. I'd be more likely to buy those things at a little weekend food fair, festival, etc. 

I would look at changing your venue, changing your target market, or changing your food. Focus on a small menu offering hero products. Like, Asian noodles could be your thing. Or Bao buns. Whatever it is you can make. Or just straight-up interesting, fantastic burgers. And don't neglect your branding and the appearance of your actual truck. 

If you're not going for a hipster/indie food truck vibe, and you're more like a junk food van, then try finding a spot near nightlife or student areas and doing Thur-Sat nights?

Basically, keep evolving and experimenting. 

I haven't run a food truck before, but I have run two physical/local businesses. One was a vintage business, selling clothing and furniture at vintage markets. The first year, I did a whole ton of different fairs to figure out the best one. For instance, there was a massive vintage market in one location - with huge footfall. BUT I found that I had a much better time at a smaller, more hipster little weekend vintage market. I also found that at the huge market, people wanted to find ""deals"". At the little hipster market, people were willing to pay $300+ for a simple chair or vintage mirror. 

I now run a dog walking business. I started 9 months ago. I had originally planned to just work around 10-3 daily, walking little local dogs. I quickly found that actually, people really wanted pet sitting, and Mon-Fri dog walking requests are rare, since I live in a creative urban area where a lot of people work from home at least half of the week. So now pet sitting represents 60% of my client base. I'm not making a full time income from this yet, but I anticipate being able to in the next year, through further experimentation and shaping my business offerings to suit demand/my target clients. The same lessons can apply to what you are doing. It's all about learning about your customers, watching them, listening to them, and shifting your focus.

As for how long to stick it out - in general, I don't start any business unless I can see myself being happy to completely commit to it for 3 years, minimum. Ideally, 5 years. The only time I'll quit before the 3-year mark is if I come to realise I actually hate the business and it wasn't what I had imagined. But you can't just do the same thing for 3 years and hope things change. You have to think of these three years as an experiment so that you can learn."

Dogtraining,fef1x7s,t3_clxbvc,1579046250.0,"Listen. Shit happens. Life happens. You're here asking for advice just a month in, assuming you got her at around 8 weeks old. Do you know how many idiots ignore problems until 6+ months later? Thus, you're clearly not an idiot. Actually, it seems to me that you are smart, trying your damn best, dealing with many pressures, genuinely love your puppy, and genuinely want to do things right. 

So, just start again. 

Honestly, the most simple thing you can remember when you think about your puppy is this:

CAUSE + EFFECT

Don't overthink it. Don't stress about it. Just understand that dogs think like ""when I do this, this is the result"". 

So, when she cries, she learns that she gets released from her crate. If you don't release her from her crate, she'll learn that crying keeps her in her crate. Therefore, she will soon enough stop crying. 

You can then just use logic to reduce the risk of crying in the first place. What is likely to tire your puppy out so that she can relax and sleep in her crate? Well, things like playing with her and training her in the evenings, and not giving her long evening nap times before bed time. Keeping her brain occupied and challenged with puzzles and commands and Kongs. Just think of it like this: before she goes into her crate, your goal is to get her nice and relaxed. Google crate training and learn the simple steps to get her to associate the crate with positive things. Go on YouTube and search ""Zak George crate training"". He explains it really nicely.

As for housetraining, it sounds like she has free roam of too much space without your supervision. Scale it back, not at all as a punishment, but to support her. Your goal is to give her a little space at first (an open crate inside an x-pen or small room), then once she's mastered that (no accidents for a few weeks), you can extend her space gradually. Get her on a schedule whenever you are home with her. Crate/x-pen for an hour, then out to go potty, play, train, and back in again. You don't have to be rigid, just consistent. Again, search for ""Zak George house training"" on YouTube and that should help you.

TO be honest, if someone used to give thoughtful gifts and they no longer do, it’s a sign that they’ve checked out in some way. Maybe temporarily, maybe as a one off, maybe they didn’t actually feel that you appreciated or enjoyed previous thoughtful gifts and they don’t know what to get. But either way, it feels shit and it’s a sign of a disconnect."
jobs,fdmnu6r,t3_elutxt,1578557243.0,"Personally? I would speak up. 
Tell your manager in your next meeting “I would like to find a way to be more useful and put my skills to work.”
Also say “I appreciate that you’ve been giving me as much work as you can and that you’ve been trying to sort out my role during the whole merger process”
And ask “Do you think there are any departments that could use my help?”

I know you have applied for a few other jobs. I would apply aggressively. I’m talking at least one new job a day, but preferably more than that. 
Even if you don’t apply to jobs that are directly related to what you want to do, your main problem is having nothing to do all day while being monitored and prevented from having anything to do. You are in a toxic workplace where people don’t know how to manage, and their own managers don’t know how to manage. Your best option, in my opinion, is to get out as soon as possible into SOMETHING better, even if it’s not THE thing you want to do long term. 

I would also save as much money as humanly possible starting now. You’ve said you’re working on reducing bills, so get that sorted. Stockpile as aggressively as possible and give yourself a cushion. 

Then if the only job you can land is not quite relevant to your field, keep looking. The hope is that the next place will at least either occupy you or give you the autonomy to occupy yourself. 

I had a concierge in a building I lived in once, and he wanted to be a fireman. He took the concierge job literally because it allowed him to study and acquire skills at his desk. Nobody was monitoring him. He could read books and bring his laptop and when he wasn’t performing a concierge task, he was developing his skills for the career he did want. 

So that’s what I’m thinking. Apply for things even out of left field, purely to improve your current daily existence as a starting point."
jobs,fddhx7t,t3_ekgfrj,1578312996.0,"At the end of the day, it comes down to you.

If you:

\- Have enough money to cover your expenses

\- Can deal with the risk of not being able to find a new job for quite a long time

\- Can deal with the stress of your money potentially running out

Then I say, go for it.

Sounds like you have good skills. You could land a new job quickly, within the next 3-6 months. Or, you might find it really tough out there and only be able to find jobs you don't want to do. That's why it really comes down to how well you deal with risk, stress, and uncertainty. 

Me personally? I can be reckless, and I don't like doing things that I hate. As long as I have enough money to cover my basic expenses, even if nothing else, I will quit a sucky job even if I don't have another lined up. I've done it many times. 

Good luck!"
