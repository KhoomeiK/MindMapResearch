Then there is the idea that that is why, as humans get older we perceive time going faster, and perceive children as ‘zipping around’, and quick with energy."
todayilearned,fed4gy9,t1_fed48th,1578998385.0,"Humans are in slow-motion to organisms smaller than them.

The smaller an animal is, and the faster its metabolic rate, the slower time passes.

Entoliths have very slow metabolic rates, *and* are microscopic, so everything around them must be at a complete standstill, for thousands and thousands of human years.

wholesomememes,fecwmtu,t1_febgxia,1578987561.0,"Tell him. You may have an aversion to the PG (propylene glycol) in the VG/PG mix that he’s vaping. Have him switch to ‘Max VG’ juices. If this doesn’t alleviate it, buy him some straight VG (vegetable glycerine), some VG nicotine, and he can make his own ‘juice’ without any PG. 
The added good part of the last scenario is that what used to cost 15-20 quid in juice, will now cost .50 quid. I really wish companies would start selling No Flavor, 100%VG juice."
