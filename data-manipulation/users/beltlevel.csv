longhair,fel9m5w,t3_epow8d,1579217071.0,"Split ends travel up the length and damage more of your hair. Broken ends will split faster than an end cut by sharp hairdressing shears. As you have fine hair, it's even more important for you to cut off the damage. You shouldn't have to be ""super careful"" when brushing as long as you're starting from the ends and working your way up, as tangles just kinda fall out when brushing healthy hair in this method. Your difficulty is probably from the damage. Damage=rough, tangly, brittle hair

Brush your hair out with your BBB before washing your hair–if you go into the shower with no tangles and are shampooing properly (washing only the roots with a firm massage using the pads of your fingers) your hair will be better. Fine hair is less resistant to damage, so your blow-drying is really not conducive to healthy length. Since you've stated this in non-negotiable, at least use the 'cool' setting. 

Brush often, as the oil from your scalp is one of the best things for your lengths."

The healthcare system makes money off of the obese from bariatric surgery, knee replacements, insulin sales, amputation, liposuction, skin tightening, cardiac surgery, arterial support, blood thinners, cholesterol managers, bariatric chairs, etc. The obese who refuse to believe their doctors spend money on anything and anyone who is willing to coddle them and tell them they don't need to change.

The only thing in the world that we ever have control over is our own selves. What he did was his action, not yours. He invaded your space.

It's okay to admit that you went into a ""risky"" situation by being tipsy, etc. Just remember that if someone is going to take advantage of your vulnerability (whether it be youth, intoxication, lack of mobility, or anything else), that is THEIR choice.

If a person excuses their morbidly obese child's excessive eating (which is disordered! Emotional eating to deal with things, binging, etc. is NOT OKAY and the person needs therapy) because they think ""it's just baby fat"" that needs to be called out.
