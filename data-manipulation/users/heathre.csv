AmItheAsshole,ffe7rn2,t1_ffe4xl1,1579838996.0,"I agree with you. The kind of forgiveness i was talking about was what you described here. It doesnt mean accepting ongoing abuse or becoming a doormat. It is a result of work within yourself to come to terms with your experience, heal, and hopefully, in time and on your own terms, leads to forgiveness. The work on yourself is exactly what i meant when i took issue with forgiveness being entirely out of our hands. That work *is* work, even if shutting down and holding grudges is more effort in the long term.

Holding grudges, becoming hardened and bitter and angry in the long term, is bad for your emotional wellbeing. I dont believe working on yourself to come to terms with your experiences and not cling to resentment ""forces"" you to forgive someone when they dont warrant it or before youre ready. Its just part of working towards being a happier and healthier person. Becoming more forgiving when forgiveness is appropriate is good shit."

AmItheAsshole,ffdgapy,t1_ffdblzj,1579820260.0,"I mean.. people cant force you to forgive them and it *is* up to the wronged person to decide when and if someone can be forgiven. 

But that said, we *should* strive to be the kind of people who can forgive if the other person is sincerely regretful. Holding grudges isnt good for our own mental health and it makes us bitter and inflexible. I cant really get behind a dodge that absolves people of responsibility in this area because it really does take effort to reframe a situation and be the kind of generous of spirit that is forgiving. It cant be forced but it can be worked on.

Thats not saying OP should have accepted this obviously insincere apology on the timeline preferred by his bully. I just object to the idea that the ability to forgive others just magically happens at some point, and isnt a result of our own efforts."

AskFeminists,ff9acsi,t1_ff7n8n6,1579708461.0,"I think thats part of what bothers me about this. Bernie isnt just another rando politician. Hes a leftist, and has been remarkably dedicated and consistent for decades on decades. He supports things that leftists could only dream of a few years ago and for many leftists, is seen as the only politician arguing outside of neocon/neolib talking points. More centrist liberals see bernie supporters as often a more extreme fringe of ""their side"" who just need to tone it down and get in line, but many leftists see liberals and conservatives both as regressive. Liberals just use ""woke"" window dressing like the female billionaires thing to cover for maintaining class hierarchies and oppression. 

Bernie is a feminist. Bernie supporters can be very dedicated, oftentimes disconcertingly vitriolic. But they are ruthless to biden and buttegieg as well. And many support warren as #2 (at least until last week). Dismantling the current political and economic structure is what will really help women.

>the profits of the Crown Estate are **public money** and all go to the Treasury. This is then collected together with the income the Treasury gets from general taxation and other sources, into one pot: the “Consolidated Fund”. We’ll refer to this pot as “public money”; most of it comes from general taxation, but some of it is from non-tax sources (such as the Crown Estate profits)...The Treasury then pays the Sovereign Grant to the Queen, which is currently calculated as the equivalent of 25% of the Crown Estate’s profits two years previously.

**And relevant to that:**
>But the Crown Estate isn’t the royal family’s private property. 

So theyre still getting a bunch of money for being the monarchy based on the income from land they don't even own (not that owning a bunch of the country cos monarchy would be legit either)

**How much money?**
>In 2019/20 the Queen will receive £82 million.

**and thats not all:**
>The Queen also receives private income from two other sources.

>One is the Privy Purse, used to meet the some of the Sovereign’s and royal family’s private and official expenditure. It’s funded by other landholdings, collectively called the Duchy of Lancaster....In the year to March 2018, the income from the Duchy was around £20 million.

>The other is private investment income from holdings... These aren’t owned by the “Sovereign” as an abstract entity, but by the Queen personally. As this is private income, we don’t know how much this amounts to.

**and they do bring in tourism, but exactly how much is hard to quantify. The article provides this as an example:**
>It’s impossible to know the wider economic benefit of the monarchy exactly. One estimate... said that in 2017 the monarchy contributed £1.8 billion to the UK economy, of which around £550 million came from tourism. This is a gross figure (so before the estimated costs have been subtracted). The net contribution estimate is *£1.5 billion a year.*

>This estimate is largely subjective depending on what factors you think should or shouldn’t be included.

>For example, the report estimates the monarchy contribute £50 million towards the media industry by providing the inspiration and “mystique” for TV shows like The Crown and plays like King Charles III. It’s up to you to decide whether you think those should or shouldn’t be included."

internetparents,fdhske8,t3_elfde0,1578429363.0,"Its kind of hard to say without knowing the context youre meeting people in. Are you chatting with classmates at school? Work colleagues? Teammates? Are you bonding with people over a hobby, a date, or at a bar? 

You might find it useful to listen to what other people in the situation are talking or asking about, and mirror those conversations. People like to talk about themselves, so if they ask you a question, they probably consider that an appropriate topic and have their own answers they want to give. I cant imagine someone thinking youre selfish because you didnt know to ask them something out of the blue, it would usually be because they asked you something and you didnt inquire the same thing of them.

Talking about deep issues like politics or religion or very personal experiences is usually something you get to later, but preferences and opinions about the situation at hand is usually pretty harmless. Bonding over sports, music, tv shows, etc, is an easy way to chat without getting too personal. Think about the things that you get excited about, and you like to talk about. And things that make you uncomfortable or distant. Your radar might be a little bit skewed because of your upbringing, but seeing what interests other people can be a good guide, and as you encounter more people youll understand it more naturally.

I agree with the other person who said that you can use ""if you dont mind my asking.."" or ""do you mind if i ask..?"". Another good way is to just show interest and curiosity, without asking very specific questions. ""What did you think about x?"" Or ""thats so interesting! Tell me more"" kind of stuff. Then the other person can choose how much they want to share. Just try to be positive and interested, even if you feel a little awkward. And dont forget, everyone is a little awkward. We all have different ideas about what we should and shouldnt say and when. Its not like everyone else just ""gets it"" and you dont. :)"

Have you considered talking to him about how this is a story that someone wrote and he is allowed to interact with the story however he wants?

Thats not to say, ""its fiction and its dumb to care"". Because games, tv shows, and books can be incredibly immersive and compelling. I absolutely understand being heartbroken over a character in a fictional narrative. But it *is* just a story, and there are no rules about how he has to engage with it. The character he cared about is an idea someone else made for him to engage with, and he is capable of choosing how he thinks of the story. He doesnt have to accept how someone else thinks the story should end. He can imagine, or even write out, his own version of how things ended. He could make an epilogue or an alternative version where what he wanted to happen happens. I dont know the game personally, but i think this kind of thing is called ""head canon"" in fandoms. Maybe it was a dream or a fake out or something.  Maybe theres magic or some other deus ex machina.

I understand that autism can be very rigid and he might not embrace this kind of thing, but stories are just ideas other people share for us to enjoy however we want. He can take the stuff he liked from it and do whatever he wants with it. He can remember it however he prefers and games arent history, hes not obligated to absorb this heartbreak. He has the power to do whatever he wants with this story because it was written by people who are people, just like him, and he has just as much right to decide how he wants to think about it as they do. There may even be stories other people wrote online ""correcting"" the plot in a way they prefer. I recently watched a series that ended in a *very* unpopular way with fans, and many just decided to pretend the show ended ten minutes earlier. They figured the show was excellent until ten minutes before the end of the finale, so they just rejected the last-minute ""twist"" that would otherwise ruin the whole thing for them.

smallboobproblems,fcw56ls,t1_fcw3f00,1578017408.0,"I mean, youre commenting on a days old post because you took issue with people who dont enjoy the toxic atmosphere of this sub and choose to leave. I never said the sub should change or go away, i never said my way was the only way. I said i didnt like it or gain anything from it so i left. I never attacked you, im obviously not trolling or gleeful. I just dont feel it necessary to get in some personal battle with someone who feels differently than me about this.

I was confused by your level of aggression so i checked your post history out of curiosity. You even said yourself that despite not receiving negative feedback on your body, youre paranoid because of the stuff youve seen on this sub. Thats the kind of thing im talking about. I would like to have bigger boobs, but i dont, and im ok with it. My body is what it is, and i wouldnt want to spend time with anyone who would tell me im less because of it. So why would i want to spend time in a place where people get together and talk about how bad my body is. 

I never said you shouldnt have a place to vent, because were all at different stages of our body acceptance journey. I misread what this sub was about, so i left. I dont want to be a victim, i dont think my body is ""wrong"", and i dont gain anything from being around people that do. Like i said before, if its helpful for you, im glad you have that. If its making you feel worse about yourself, or assume that your body is secretly awful, maybe its not that great a place. Either way, my leaving isnt an attack against you and im not trying to make you feel bad."
