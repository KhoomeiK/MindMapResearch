Everyone else = Non-Japanese

So in this instance 'everyone' falls into 3 categories:

1. Japanese people
2. Those who hate it
3. Those who like to see others upset

I'm not Japanese, and I don't hate it, therefore I *must* fall into the 3rd category, despite what I wrote previously.

We can also erroneously add a 4th category, even though it's not strictly accurate to do so, but we'll give you the benefit of the doubt:

> I do respect the genuine people who actually wanted them for other  reasons that don't involve trying to fuel the salt in the community. 

So the 4th category is:

* People who actually wanted \[Byleth\]

I didn't want Byleth, so by your logic I *must* be one of the pathetic ones, again disregarding what I wrote about being a happy bystander.

lgbt,fctdsho,t3_eip3yx,1577940074.0,"While I'm not a fan of outright banning heterosexual people from gay bars, I gotta say, having attended a gay bar for NYE, straight people need to learn how to behave in a gay bar.

Here are some tips, birthed from that experience:

- keep your elbows in when dancing
- don't put your date on your shoulders during the drag act
- don't tell every gay guy you see that going to a gay bar is much better than you expected it to be
- don't cheer whenever you see a same-sex kiss
- don't try to introduce everyone to your one gay friend

I think Gay bars should be a place of inclusivity, but straight people should be aware that this is one of our only safe spaces and that they are, essentially, visitors and they should respect our boundaries.

And with that, love to you all!"
