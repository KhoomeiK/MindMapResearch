BTW, I also bought almost all of those toys in the photo for my cat. My cat particularly loves that gray stinky mouse toy, destroyed the squeaking mouse in just a few days and the bugs didn't live 24 hours. The interchangeable feathers for the wand are cool but my cat ended up losing them all, and the colorful feathers are great until the feathers detach and my cat eats them."
