Ireland is an island in the BI, but it is not 'Britain'. Only one of those islands is called Britain. As a part of that group, would you call Ireland 'Britain'? I don't know how I can explain that to you any more clearly."

Had never even been allowed near one before, let alone allowed to go inside. There was a queue to go in and out, but I ended up chatting with the restoration guys so much they just let me sit inside with them for 30 mins while everyone else came and went. At the end I shook all their hands, then kissed my hand with a big 'MWAH' and pressed it to the Cat's hull. One of the guys teared up and we had a hug.

There was me having the time of her life hanging out with a bunch of old engineers and enthusiasts in their 60s and 70s. It was amazing.

You really do feel like a little kid on Christmas morning."
