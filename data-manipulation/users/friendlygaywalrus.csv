insaneparents,ffk67n9,t1_ffk30zs,1580017198.0,"It’s a different type of poverty. In the city you have access to lots of cheaper stuff and a little more privacy. In rural areas not only is everyone in your business, but there are literally no jobs or resources. Bad roads, bad facilities, outdated everything, one local store and a 30 minute drive to town to the nearest Walmart."

awfuleverything,ffjt632,t3_etva02,1580006260.0,"I saw this guy on Youtube that was talking about how he daisy chained razor blades on the buoy ropes of his crab traps. He knows FULL WELL that any Game Warden can come along to check his trap and get maimed. Or that the rope could come loose and maim a diver or other fisherman, or god forbid a child innertubing. Not to mention the razors just washing up on the beach. 

Booby traps work on thieves but they work on EVERYONE ELSE as well."

todayilearned,ffjsfvd,t1_ffjpo5k,1580005702.0,"These things are restricted by law and principle for a reason. Using lights to stun is unethical. Stunning and highlighting sleeping, nesting, or resting animals at night is not sporting and is dangerous at night. Using a moving vehicle is not ethical or safe. Firing from a moving vehicle at night isn’t sporting and stray bullets are deadly (through rifles) for a mile or more in any direction. Using decoys and bait also greatly increase the chances of success and in many places the conservation requirements restrict them to give more tenuous deer populations a better chance to maintain healthy numbers through a season. 

In America, the number of animals and the health of the ecosystem as a whole is foremost in all the regulations. In my state you can only use shotguns (during firearm season), no bait, and no decoys. Sure, killing a deer is the end goal, but if all the hundreds of thousands of hunters in any state used every advantage at his disposal we would run out of deer very quickly. It wasn’t even too long ago that whitetail deer populations were extremely low."
