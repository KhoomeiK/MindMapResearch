Baking,ffa0mec,t1_ff9xvgp,1579725480.0,"Ummm I kinda go by feel lol. This was actually a first attempt at a non sourdough ""artisan"" loaf since my partner (the fkn weirdo) doesn't like sourdough since it ""tastes like its gone off""... So I kind of did an abbreviated sourdough method but with Yeast instead of starter.

(all of these are pretty rough measurements) Did 2 1/2 c high grade white flour, 1/2 c. Wholemeal flour and 1 1/2c pretty hot water.

 Mixed that and let it Autolyse for about 45min. 

Added 1 tbs salt, 1tbs dry Yeast, 1/2 tbs sugar, maybe a tbs of garlic infused olive oil for flavor. 

Mixed that then let rest for 20 mins. 

Slap and folds on unfloured bench top for 5ish mins. Rise 3 hours. 

Turn out and shape it (carefully while trying not to deflate it much )  rise for another hour in a proofing basket/bowl with a floured dish towel.  I did it as 1 large boule this time but I may divide it next time and do 2 smaller ones. 

Then bake at 240c (450ish F I think?) in cast iron Dutch oven lid on for 30min, lid off for another 20 (or until the crust is how you want it)

With this loaf I actually put some sesame seeds in the proofing basket so there's that on top of the loaf too. really yummy."

funny,ff48boe,t1_ff3zowi,1579557735.0,I give my 17 month old pizza... But I make it myself with actual ingredients (inc vegetables). Fries too. He loves his potatoes (usually baked wedges with very little salt).

ShitMomGroupsSay,ff20mwq,t1_ff1uj3m,1579490642.0,I mean... That's what makes my 1 year old pass out
GifRecipes,ff1zofc,t3_eqx0sx,1579489949.0,Commenting so I can come back. Looks delicious
AmItheAsshole,ff1pr3b,t1_ff1npyn,1579483452.0,Right. Also he would be watched like a hawk in someone else's house... especially if the person doesn't have kids and hasn't childproofed their expensive things
AmItheAsshole,ff1m2h0,t1_ff0fa1w,1579481418.0,Yeah this sounds like something my 17 month old would do  because he doesn't know better... NINE? No chance.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fek6jqu,t1_fejl8e8,1579193654.0,She has a couple issues that make sitting for a long time really painful so probably not feasible
