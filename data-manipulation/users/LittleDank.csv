ChoosingBeggars,ffjqqt3,t1_ffjammf,1580004517.0,"My husband’s gamer friend had just lost his job and since he’d know him for a few years we said he could come stay with us til he got back on his feet if he could get from Arizona to California. While he was staying here I let him borrow my 2 year old car a few times. The last time he borrowed it, he didn’t pull up in the garage far enough and closed the garage door on my rear end. He agreed to pay for the damages, even signed his name to something I drew up with the cost of the insurance deductible. We ended up having to kick him out for other bullshit he, his wife and son pulled. I learned my lesson though."
