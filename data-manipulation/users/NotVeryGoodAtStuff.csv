25/m and my desk is an absolute mess."

GetMotivated,ffj8xz9,t1_ffh7gjd,1579993250.0,Not everyone lives in the U.S.
GetMotivated,ffg44nq,t1_ffg3mik,1579898051.0,Not everyone can afford to go to the doctor.
GetMotivated,ffeywyw,t3_et55bt,1579870826.0,We should definitely end the stigma but I think there needs to be a bigger push to clarify when someone is having a bad week vs they are clinically depressed.
climbing,ffbwr7j,t3_esp3dr,1579785299.0,"I used to live right beside that (before I started climbing)! 

Is it trad only or is it bolted?"
Eminem,ff3rjz8,t1_ff34lq1,1579547314.0,"No. Using my logic does not be ""O WAS A T"". I am including specifically the LETTER I because you all are saying  IS SPELLING SOMETHING. Why would he spell something while at the same time using LETTERS to communicate.

How can one subreddit be so collectively dense."
Eminem,ff2v9hy,t1_ff2v137,1579525507.0,"Crazy how genius.com (arguably the most reputable forum for lyrics) writes the lines different than this one YouTube comment.

It's also crazy how he also doesn't emphasize the letter sound which is what he would have done if he was trying to make it obvious he was spelling something."
Eminem,ff2uy7i,t1_ff2uu9d,1579525169.0,"Really? ""I was the"" rhymes with ""played in rotation?' 

Rhyme schemes are NOT how bars and lines are decided."
Eminem,ff2uqqw,t1_ff2ucfu,1579524940.0,That's why it's fucking retarded. Show me the sheet that Eminem wrote this on because I GUARANTEE you he didn't insert these line breaks.
Eminem,ff2u5x6,t1_ff2t62t,1579524290.0,"Y'all dumb af and want to overly inflate bars that are good on their own by shoving double entendres and hidden meanings when there aren't any.

I will say it again.

If Eminem was trying to spell ""I GOAT"" he wouldn't have said a SECOND 'I' in his bars. BY SAYING THAT LETTER he is changing the spelling of what he is supposedly trying to spell."
Eminem,ff2sx8v,t1_ff2sv86,1579522788.0,"It actually spells out 

I Goiat because he says I twice***

You wouldn't notice it by skimming through the post though because they intentionally made it lower case.

LOL are you really this stupid?"
Eminem,ff2ry30,t3_erbavo,1579521496.0,"This is a huge reach.

How does him saying ""I"" play into the spelling of goat? If it was intentional to spell GOAT, he would have used a different word.

Otherwise it spells oiat"
climbing,feyvxev,t1_feyvfop,1579451093.0,"This is in response to the GRR logo, not the one someone else posted. The GRR logo has the climber's hands apart, this one has the climber's hands together."

Eminem,femym0b,t1_femy255,1579272941.0,"It's an hour album and it dropped at midnight. I work a 9-5 job so i literally have not had time to listen to it 3 times.

There isn't a lot of depth to some of these songs and tbh I can only see my list of songs that I like shrink as time goes on. 

So far this falls into the MMLP2 category for me - a handful of songs I listen to on shuffle and the rest are completely forgettable."
Eminem,femy11x,t1_femxwy7,1579272539.0,Y'all stans are crazy.
Eminem,femxsnj,t1_femuhje,1579272375.0,"After listening to it once, it's probably easier for me to call out the ones that I like:

Premonition
You Gon Learn
Those kinda nights (was ok)
Godzilla (until the ending)
Darkness
Stepdad (hot take I know)
 Marsh
Lock it up
Farewell
No regrets
I will"
Eminem,femu8y6,t1_femtm2r,1579269747.0,I always do. I understand he has a huge demographic to please but if he cut this down to like 30-45 mins it'd be a classic.
Eminem,femt1fv,t1_femsqru,1579268787.0,There's a lot of filler on it.

No idea how ANYONE could even REMOTELY believe OP here. Thank you for pulling this together."

movies,fejpzwf,t1_fejph84,1579182886.0,"You could at least make an ""alt universe"" argument with comic books as I know there have been other comic book heroes (like Spider-Man) whose genders have been changed before. There's a supernatural element involved...but that doesn't really work in movies set to exist within our reality.

Why can't people just make new female characters that resemble male heroes but call them something else? I work in marketing so unfortunately I know the answer to that question."
SweatyPalms,feiuyh0,t1_fei9c2k,1579147910.0,"He is. Near the end of the video you can see a rope leading down behind him. 

Idk much about ice climbing but he probably just wanted to avoid a whip."

marketing,fdi0hih,t3_eli9j4,1578433540.0,"Imo by tailoring the software for small companies that don't want to waste time on the ""technical stuff"" you're not going to get anywhere. A lot of large organizations already don't see the value of marketing, and that only gets worse in my experience the smaller a business is.

They aren't going to want to spend money on anything marketing related because they don't see the value. 

There are also dozens of marketing tools available, some of which dominate, and so your focus should be to, imo, talk about everything that your software does that others don't. 

And everyone likes data, so try to provide actual hard numbers as to how people's jobs will be easier."

As an example I work for an insurance company that only works with brokerages we have contracts with, meaning that we literally don't do any business with people we don't have a contract with and we don't want to do business with brokerages we don't have contracts with.

We would have no value in that kind of marketing because we have the contact info of everyone we do business with. We bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in premium per year without any digital advertising."
marketing,fdhzdqi,t1_fdhf5z7,1578432944.0,"Content creation is probably referring to content marketing. a super basic example would be if you wanted to sell pocket knives, you would create an article called ""10 best budget pocket knives"" or ""X times having a pocket knife would have saved these movie characters.""
