When I told my friends that I had been preparing to become a bartender, you can guess how happy they were. They wouldn't mind being my ''lab rats'', and practice never hurts. I even plan to have a home bar, for now, I've improvised one with a simple computer table, and I put my drinks and syrups under it."

Last time I made it with Jack Daniels Honey, and it was phenomenal. Funnily enough, I dislike the normal Jack Daniels, IMO its taste is generic, but Jack Honey? Every time!

I also like some rum cocktails, favorite one is Daiquiri."

They were pretty enjoyable, and I tasted the difference between my Old Fashioneds and a simple glass of whiskey, especially since I use orange bitters, but I just feel it that I haven't got it right yet.

confidence,ff69jgv,t1_ff4c69b,1579622301.0,"Not actively for now, except writing down things that may be preventing me from dating, from a psychological point of view, because I consider that I need to work on myself a bit more and learn some basics about human interaction (I may have Asperger's) before I can start with my dating life. This might be the wrong attitude, but for the moment, I don't have much going on with my life so that I can be pretty interesting, but I'm working on that, too.

I keep telling myself and friends that this is the type of woman that I like, with that personality trait, but now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not completely sure actually what's my type, since each woman is unique, with her own qualities, flaws, dreams, insecurities, and it's just unfair to put her under a certain typology. I'm basically attaching some fantasies on her. I'm still in the process off not putting women on a pedestal whenever I consider I'd be dating them. 

I know it's nothing wrong to pursue certain types of women, as long as I keep an open mind, and accept that she may be as different to my ''fantasy'' as possible. You know what? I'm going to be ignoring my fantasies from now on, and embrace reality. First dates are for knowing the other person, determine whether I would be dating them and just having some fun, leisure time meanwhile. So why the fuck am I putting this kind of pressure on myself? It doesn't make sense, and it doesn't help me in any fucking way.

What probably doesn't help either that I'm 28, and never in my adult life I've ever dated.

I successfully asked a girl out once, but I had messed it up by acting needy and she lost interest. But despite that, I'm still proud that I asked her out anyway. I've mostly accepted my situation and sort of working on it, by reading about seduction for example, but I know that what I need to do is to go out and actually ask more women out.

And this also applies to me, who's a rather chubby dude too, but mostly got over my insecurity over my weight. Nota bene: it's perfectly fine to have preferences, nobody should be shamed because of it, but beware, you're also responsible for them. For example, if your preference would be something that only 10% of the population would fit, then you really have no right to complain if you don't meet those kind of people frequently.

AmItheAsshole,ff09aak,t3_eqzf0e,1579466593.0,"NAH. Although your wife is right by saying that you haven't experienced oppression the way Asian-Americans did, that doesn't mean that whites haven't been oppressed. Take a look at Irish and Italian immigrants in the beginning of the 20th century. IMO this is a fact that she should acknowledge, it will help her understand that not everything is as racist as she perceives them to be.

Their youngest son is not racist at all in not feeling connected to his Asian heritage, and that's a thing he shouldn't justify to anyone. I'm all for loving your culture, but since the boy is also half-white, why shouldn't he be connected to his European side too? Not saying that he actually isn't, but I assumed he or his father haven't thought much about it, based on the post. Of course, OP can correct me if I'm wrong. I was talking about how white people are seen as Nazis if they say that they're proud of being white, let alone love their own culture.

Personally, I view pride for something that you had no choice for is just a waste of time. You, as a person, literally did nothing to become white, black, Asian, latino, etc. If you're glad that you're any of those, of your culture, then it's a different story, but pride should be reserved to what you accomplish, but I digress.

I wish a happy life for OP and his family!"

I'm gonna play the Devil's advocate here a bit, but let me tell you in advance that you're NTA. I think your husband has some resentment over all this time dealing with you being pregnant. Note: I know that that's just his part of an about-to-be father, I'm not calling you out on anything. According to you, he dealt with you really well and always put your needs first, which I think is a really commendable thing.

My 2 cents is, at least from his point of view (I'm ignoring your MIL because it's a no brainers that she's an AH), things are something like ""I've dealt with my wife's mood swings and never complained about my workplace troubles, and I can't even see the birth of my own child?"" Again, not saying that you should have let him in anyway, you clearly set your boundaries beforehand, and he should have respected them, no matter how much he wanted to witness your daughter's birth.

I hope that you'll work on this thing together, and wish you three a happy family life!"

Be contempt in who you are. If you would get a girlfriend like this, you would be leeching off of her energy basically. You'll be depending on her to be happy, which will make you more insecure and clingy, women are not attracted to that, and for a good reason. You'd give her the burden of always reassuring you and coddle you, and I doubt you'd want that. Supporting each other and cuddling are one thing, but you are partners, and not parent and child.

NoFap,fen1lal,t1_femy1pi,1579274932.0,"So much this! I think it's a rookie mistake to base our happiness on noFap. We tend to forget that ultimately, it's a tool for our self-improvement. A piece of the puzzle. Resisting the urges, semen retention are all well in good, but you've got to have other things in your life if you want be be naturally joyful, like exercise, meditation, a social life, hobbies, and work.

I've come to the point of not feeling guilty over my relapse. I forgive myself now and try to learn what the relapse had taught me. This is the attitude that actually let's you get over your addiction. The world doesn't end if you relapse. 

Stay strong, brothers!"
NoFap,femzs0i,t3_epyf9j,1579273741.0,"After 24 days, I've relapsed as well. 3 times yesterday evening, twice this day around 1 a.m., and took a cold shower to ''cleanse'' myself after this binge. For me, the last PMOs felt really good. I personally am into POV stuff, and searched for a Latina because I'm a sucker for Latina women. Like the other lads, I'd been struggling with my addiction, but I can tell you that I'm slowly winning, despite going on and off with this shit. 

I had done the 90 days noFap before, I'll do it again. I've learned that doesn't matter how many times I fail, I still can hold myself accountable without beating myself over (no pun intended). The negative feelings that naturally come around like some anxiety, brain fog, extra worrying (at least in my case) are punishment enough. Negative self-talking doesn't make things better. 

I know that I'm winning, because I can resist the urges better, and felt pride when I hit the 3 week milestone.

AskMen,fek0ftb,t1_fejk8j2,1579189945.0,"A non-sexual friendship between a guy and a girl is indeed possible, albeit it's rarely 100% because in most of the cases, the guy either has some feelings for her, either wouldn't mind sleeping with her and there's nothing wrong with this in itself. 

I know we can put our sexual desires aside and develop a good platonic relationship with a woman, but let's face it. Some guys' feelings towards their girl friends is very strong, and although the girl shouldn't date him if she doesn't want to, it's on him if he hadn't asked her out yet and acted like a simple friend. In other words, he put himself in the friendzone. Attraction (and lack thereof) is not a choice.

As a guy, you have to behave a tad differently to a potential partner than to a female friend. There are cases where a guy doesn't mind being simply friends with a girl, even if he's attracted to her, and you're right, it's not the end if the world if she only wants him as a friend, but let's say his feelings for her are too strong to be simple friends with (I think you know as well how shitty that feeling is), then what shall he do, just suck it up? We're also worthy of our own happiness, and we're also not obligated to be friends with her if we don't want to. 

It's more selfish to expect others to prioritize you over themselves IMO, and this doesn't count things like volunteering, helping the needy, or even stuff like your friend actually needing your help, or you're working longer hours to support your family, then putting their needs over yours is absolutely a good thing and should be appreciated, even if you do this stuff often without hearing as much as a ""thank you"", because you know that it's the right thing to do and your responsibility. 

And regarding sensitive guys, there's nothing wrong with that. It's the reason why I put the word ""sensitive"" between quotation marks, since I wanted to make a distinction between sensitive guys who are in touch with their emotions (but still can be manly) and guys who say they are ""sensitive"" because they are only following an agenda, AKA ""nice guys"".

Rereading my comment, I can see why I might have sounded like I'm shitting on sensitive guys, but I was merely talking about women who say they find sensitive and even ""feminine"" guys (again, nothing wrong  with this, you do you) attractive, but still fall for the ""sexist"", masculine man. In other words, don't be sensitive because women told you to be. Have a sensitive side because it's part of you, you have accepted it, and still can cultivate your masculine energy. Basically, accept all parts of yourself and love yourself."
AskMen,fejje4k,t1_fejcmxp,1579176756.0,"Straight women are into masculine men? Wow, I've never even realized this before! 

Sarcasm aside, those kind of women (especially heterosexual) who want men to act more feminine because ""toxic masculinity"" make me laugh. I mean, what do you want? A partner you can count on? Your polar opposite with whom you complement? Or a ""girl friend"" with a penis? Because this is what you get when you want guys to be more ""sensitive"". And now take a look at all the guys that are in the friendzone, and tell me there's a difference."

AmItheAsshole,fedqu19,t1_fedmali,1579017908.0,"OP celebrating his bully's death makes me think that he was a more despicable piece of shit than your average bully, assuming OP isn't exaggerating, but I agree, he still didn't deserve to die. I was also bullied by a quarter of my class throughout Middle School, and typically, telling the teachers wasn't working, sometimes I was blamed. 

I admit, there were moments when I wanted to beat the shit out of some of them, and in some days, I managed to fight back somewhat, but I always was outnumbered. I had some friends, but they were in different classes, and I simply was an easy target, being introverted and the ''quiet kid''. 

I've been learning about spirituality and some psychology, and I know that many bullies have shitty family lives themselves, and this is how they turn their hopelessness outwards. Note: this is not to say that bullying others is justified, but it's the first step to understanding others, and hence, giving them a chance to redeem themselves somewhat, or worst case, letting the anger go and forgetting about them altogether. Wouldn't be great if we would actually resolve bullying overall? And most ''anti-bullying'' methods just don't work. So I also don't subscribe to bullies being ''literally Hitler'' either, even if you want to feed them their teeth, and honestly, this is a thing that I'm still learning to understand. 

I'm 28 years old now, and memories about my bullying still come to the surface, and I still feel anger. Sometimes  I'm thinking that I'd want some kind of closure, like them saying sorry, and I'm already working on forgiving them. I met one of my former bullies about 2-3 years ago, who was probably the biggest asshole among them, and he kind of looked like a deadbeat dad (he was strolling his baby daughter). We talked a bit, things were seemingly cool between us: he might have appeared to regret what he'd put me through and was genuinely wanting to have a good rapport with me back then, and I realized that I've been angry all this time for nothing. I held no ill intentions towards him anymore, wished him the best in life and we parted ways. In the end, despite being really difficult, it's important to let go and forgive, and you do these two for yourself, as the advice goes.

Anyway I've been ranting here a bit, so let me return before I completely float away. ESH, and the reason why I think mentioning my spirituality is relevant, was that I truly believe in karma, and I know a thing or two about how it works, so if I'm not wrong, OP has practically poisoned his soul with his passive revenge. What goes around, comes around. As many people have said, he hadn't proved that he's better than the bully. He might be happy on the surface, but this lingering feeling will be with him for a good while. Or, he might truly be happy, and I'm just being ''New Age'' here. Everybody has the right to believe in what they want to believe, do whatever they want to do. I only hope that OP will achieve true happiness that he needs."

unpopularopinion,fed8ars,t3_eoadpr,1579003417.0,"I'm pretty sure this is mostly an American thing, albeit there are indeed people outside the US that focus on things like race rather more than necessary (which is mostly not). I really don't understand why certain people base their identity on their race/ethnicity/sexual orientation/gender identity, yadda yadda. If you're not ashamed of who you are, more power to you, but to focus on that so much that you forget who YOU are. That's just ridiculous. There's a thing called Law of Projection, it basically means that if you only see/focus on a certain thing, for example racists, you will only see racists. That's your filter, so every thing that you see and hear, you interpret them as racist. Or sexist, transphobic, all of these apply as well, obviously. This is a reason why I don't find gay pride parades a good thing. Don't get me wrong, for one part, I see where they're coming from. Gay people have been persecuted, have been told that they're ''wrong'', for many years, and now they're showing that they've accepted themselves and are happy the way they are, which is a very good thing. On the other hand, if you focus too much on you being gay (being almost naked, wearing a dildo necklace, going to far with the rainbow accessories, overall being too flamboyant), that is weirding people out, and believe me, that this is not due to homophobia. Why would you think that behaving like this would be completely normal? Key and Peele's ''Office Homophobe'' skit is a good illustration about this topic IMO. As long as there's no harm done against others, everybody has the right to do whatever they want, and they deserve no hostility because of that. But in order for that, people should also be aware of what they're doing and how their actions may impact it or influence others."

OP is definitely NTA. It really is ridiculous that his ex-wife actually defended their daughter's texting while driving. It really doesn't matter that she ''does it safely'', you're in a vessel that's solely maneuvered by you, many times among other vessels maneuvered by other people, with a huge range of personalities, and seemingly, texting and driving as well (I hope that this is more uncommon than OP's daughter and mother makes it out to be). The driver is solely responsible for his/her own safety, and that includes paying attention to their surroundings.

I don't have a driver's license and have never actually driven. so I don't know how much my insight is valid, but I squirm when I see someone driving and on the phone, except on traffic lights and it's obvious that they have some time, so at least checking some stuff is kind of acceptable IMO.

I hope the mother and the daughter will learn that texting and driving is a dangerous thing. I wish the best for the OP and their family!"

Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed that many people are just satisfied that the Big Bang happened, and not who/what it caused it. I mean, even that must have been the effect of something. If a scientist would be willing to give us their insight, that would be greatly appreciated.

I see that you also believe, at least to an extent, that our thoughts have some power, that are ""alive"", have their own energy, hence the power of praying and meditation. 

Thanks for the recommendation of that documentary, and I wish you the best!"

Do you meditate or do other different practices, regardless of the religion/philosophy they came from? What purpose do they serve in your life?

Do you believe in a Higher Power?"
