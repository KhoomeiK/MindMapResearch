My dismissal of recent projects didn't come from nowhere though dude. Every single thing I've seen him in since probably the early 2000's has been terrible, so now I don't bother with his stuff any more. It always feels like he's only in it for the paycheck and his acting is hammy because he doesn't care.

Is it racist if you made a similar post but changed it to something about British people and colonial practices? 

I don't think jokes involving stereotypes of race or nationality or religious belief are automatically offensive. /r/polandball would be fucked if that was the case.

I'm a person like everyone else. Who the fuck are you to say the same thing?

Yes? 

Fucking hilarious how bent out of shape you are over it. ""Well Me and Mark both call it a studio album so there!""

It wasn't recorded in a recording studio, which it should be to fit the definition of a studio album.

It was recorded at home on a four track. It's a demo. 

I've recorded lots of demos in the past, and I can see why I might like to retroactively consider them studio albums if I somehow had the meteoric success of Blink 182, even though deep down I would know that's not really what they are.
