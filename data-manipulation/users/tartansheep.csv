I woke up feeling full which was horrible. I’m just going to relax a bit. I know that some weeks I’ve done so much exercise that I’ve burned like 1000 calories from several runs according to my Fitbit, and then eaten .... a lot less than that. Time to get my head sorted.

Started period Friday. I was 160.2lb, then Saturday was 166lb.. and since then I’ve been binging. Not sure if it counts as a binge. Maybe Saturday - Sunday and today been having 2500 calories a day. Went running Saturday and Sunday (two 5km runs). Today I have a bad cough cold and I’m off work because I feel so dizzy and yep...! I am eating a lot! 

I’m just under 5’10 so it isn’t that bad... but I guess maybe I should eat more than 1200 calories normally lol. I know I need to eat when I’m sick.

ukpolitics,feor9jk,t1_feoqj3l,1579304362.0,"Well amusingly, the more premature you are the greater your risk of mental health issues. I have wanted to not exist or to have never existed many times, when I was ill.

Now I am better and I am pleased I’m here. But if I had been aborted, I wouldn’t know any different, would I? 

So I suppose I am pro choice because as a woman I want to be able to choose if having a baby is right for me. To me, abortion is no different to taking the morning after pill or to use contraception, and I have done both of those things. 

And also as a woman the morality of it all falls to me. A man can wank into a flannel and waste so so many sperm and nobody cares! 

But if I got pregnant if contraception failed (which it has done in the past), I would not want a child. I don’t think my mental health is stable enough. I’d rather not have a child than give it a hard or harsh life. 

I don’t want children. But I also don’t particularly want an abortion, so I’ll be doing everything I can to prevent pregnancy."

I am a terrible dancer, for context. My PE teacher used to tell the class to watch me as an example of what not to do. So this was scary! 

However I did the hour class AND spent half that time solidly in the cardio zone! 

I’m quite pleased!! I know it’s not very impressive. I’m not sure I’ll go back to that one but I get free classes with my gym membership. Usually I sign up and cancel, but not this time!!

Hope things are good with you! X"
AmItheAsshole,fdc8ikp,t1_fdc86ya,1578269182.0,"Well, the bar rejected and came through the nipple to the outside - nearly, nearly... so it’s a bit... battered. I have inverted nipples normally so maybe that didn’t help, and it wasn’t pierced too well either. The other one is absolutely fine and happy but that one now is not ideal looking. Luckily it’s mostly inverted so it’s not a big deal but I doubt I could have it pierced again because it was damaged. :( 

I got them pierced because I am flat chested anyway and have a weird chest (Pectus carinatum) and then the inverted nipples, I figured I’d get them pierced so that I liked something. But then that didn’t work too well. 

Sorry to rant!! 

I am mostly okay lol. My mum says I’d look better if I lost another stone love that !! 

God sorry to rant. It’s late here and I should be asleep 

Xx"
AmItheAsshole,fdc4pfy,t1_fdbq61k,1578267058.0,"Might sound obvious but check the titanium isn’t coated. I got my nipples pierced with titanium, they asked if I wanted black, I said yeah sure... and turns out the black was a coating of Teflon! One rejected and my nipple split !! 

Mind you if I had listened to my body or got it checked it’d be okay. So my advice (unwarranted and I’m sorry!) is to check it’s proper titanium. And if you think it’s not quite right then go back and ask!

Sorry I know you’re not after advice. Just general ranting I guess..."

When I did it I definitely took my time. I’d had time off for a bad ankle which took six weeks off. 

I have had to learn the difference between listening to my body and knowing when I am being lazy. Sometimes yep I am being lazy but sometimes it is definitely my body. I was going to go for a run today but I am tired. So what I’ve done is got my running stuff on and gone for a walk. And hey, turned out I could go for a run. But you have to listen to your body! 

No shame at all in taking longer or going slower. You are doing it! That’s what counts! I never thought I’d finish it. I have tried and given up before. So for me taking it slow was the only way to keep going"

Might see what I can do. 

Thank you"
