Literally no one brought up politics except for you. This is a ridiculous take. The reason they are TWEETING as opposed to sending a message to their members is because this isn't directed at members - it's directed at management.

investing,fffbyh5,t1_fff9xqj,1579880597.0,"There might be different terms for it but essentially the more frequent way vol (atm straddles) moved in energy options is by number of cents rather than % vol. So straddles would be up 10 ticks across the board (for each month) rather vega moving up .1% across the board (although there certainly were vega moves occasionally). We'd call these tick moves ""tilt"", i.e. all straddles up 10 ticks would be ""straddles up on tilt 10 ticks"". Because tilt moves were much more frequent than vega moves, we used a metric called OEVs that would allow us to think about our vol exposure in terms of tilt moves. This is done by dividing the vega of the strike by the vega of the atm. So if your position had 100 OEVs, it meant your exposure was the equivalent of 50 atm straddles. For instance, a move of 10 tics in straddles might be a 1 vol move for january but a .1 vol move for may. So we'd now have a metric that could tell us our exposure to the far more relevant tilt moves than the vega moves."

Most of those podcasts are staffed by 2 or more people, nearly all of whom host multiple podcasts, most podcasts aren't more than once a week, and I'd say 5 of them actually generate meaningful revenue. It's a 35 person max staff, including Bill and the sales team.

Edit: Wikipedia says 43 employees at launch, so we can assume it's at 50 now? They've lost a number of employees in the interim though i.e. Tate, Titus, etc.

You are correct, we should add Bill's salary to EBITDA (although practically he's taking his on the back end) for the purposes of acquisition. Let's say average 100k per employee including benefits - $5mm salaries, $4mm for Bill, Russillo, Sal plus 2 other key personnel, $1mm annually on equipment and website (storage, graphics, etc.). This doesn't include capex, just COGS. 

At $15mm topline you're now at $5mm EBITDA, although AT&T has its own sales staff, software engineers, graphics designers, and executive team, so you can cut at least 15 people off the bat. 

Let's say $7mm EBITDA conservatively - 15x gets you $105mm, 20x gets you $140mm, 25x gets you $175mm, and depending on cost cuts, could be $200mm.

Asset light subscription-based companies growing at 10-20% get 15-20x all day. Only thing stopping AT&T are the reasons I mentioned above."
Jewish,ff32f5k,t1_ff30zio,1579531907.0,"AIPAC doesn't set up other PACs, not sure what propaganda you read that says that. AIPAC is a group of American citizens who support Israel. They lobby the government of their own country to support the only Jewish democracy in the Middle East. 69% of the 350-million US population support Israel. And many of them happen to be Christian, yes - 65% of America is Christian. Bunch of benjamins though, right? Bunch of Jews punching above their weight with their Jew money, right? America would never support Israel without that Jew money right? Because that's what Omar, Tlaib, and their Jewish useful idiots imply.

Israel receives aid, much like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan also receive aid. The only reason it receives any military aid at all is because it is surrounded by nations who would destroy it if its military were not powerful - although it seems people such as yourself might be cool with that. America benefits by having a democratic ally in a hostile region who stands for the benefits of a free, self-determining people. Not to mention the R&D Israel shares with the US (Iron Done, etc.) and the bombing missions it runs on mutual enemies Iran and Syria.

Support for Israel is among all Americans is at 69% - that is why politicians care about Israel - the Saudis and Qataris pour money into lobbying and don't have nearly the support Israel does.

billsimmons,ff2y7zt,t3_ercsrb,1579528419.0,"First off, I'd say margins are in the 70% range given podcast equipment and storage (cheap) and employees, none of whom are making more than 500k (I would guess). A $10.5mm EBITDA media brand can absolutely get an 18x multiple in this market, since it's likely growing at 10%+.


Several major issues preventing that multiple from becoming a reality: 1) the most popular podcasts are entirely dependent on Bill and his reputation, much like Barstool was before PMT. If he walks you're fucked, so expect this to be a serious earnout type of situation 2) they have unionized employees, making them a huge pain in the ass to deal with 3) all they do is podcasts, no gambling partnerships (how is guess the lines not exclusively sponsored by draftkings at this point?), events like Rough and Rowdy, no merch, no Barstool Gold 4) the $15mm topline seems to good to be true - could be a run-rate figure 5) Bill is no longer the hot commodity among the 20-40 year old sports fan anymore - he's turning into Rick Reilly"
