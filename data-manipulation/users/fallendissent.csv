todayilearned,fdemw36,t1_fdeilcp,1578342381.0,"$30 billion is because of the trade war, its because the government shut off a major export. They would do that for any industry that was affected as heavily as ag was, china directly targeted US AG. You cannot point to an event specific bill and say it answers the whole question. It doesn't.

The US has no long standing direct subsidies for crop producers. The trade war subsidies are an exception, and why? Because they literally shut off half the market for a ton of US exports and don't want them to go away. Let me reiterate. They shut down the free market and so they have to subsidize until they reopen the free market. You cannot point to the exception and say it is the rule. 

You say ""US AG isn't libertarian"" and then point to something that was caused by and completely unlibertarian policy. Those subsidies would not exist except for market meddling. There are no subsidies for normal US ag products in the normal course of the free market which fully exists. There are very very few exceptions, I will name them. Cranberries get unfair market manipulations, and Sugar is a protected industry for national security reason (but still get no subsidies). 

Again, you cannot point to the exception and say it is the rule. There is no direct subsidy program for growing crops in the US."

Also that business insider piece is a bunch of garbage, it has no conclusion, it's outdated, AND it's misleading. There are no direct subsidies for crop production.

Who the fuck cares if you were driving at 12. I was driving at 10, I was trained. I started driving heavy equipment around 12 and truck around 13. It's not like I didn't know what I was doing. Also I can't hire some random 12 year old to do it, it has to be direct family legally. Just because you weren't doing things legally with your fertilizer delivery doesn't mean the rules arn't there. They ARE regulated.

Do you know how much I have to pay a farm worker now days? My guys make $45k when it's all said and done, in a cheap to live state no less. You say we don't pay people anything but you obviously don't know that the labor market in the ag sector is pretty slim pickings in the last 10 years or so.

The current ""bailout"" is not unprecedented when the government gets in trade wars. It has nothing to do with farms, it really only has to do with the fact that farms were the targeted group. Do I think it was a good idea? That remains to be seen.

If you've read almost any of those USDA programs you would know they only are available for small farms and small operations. They are still loans. You can still lose your property for not paying it back. 

CRP is voluntary conservation. You're bitching about farmers destroying land but hate CRP? Really?

You can't say the US makes it so other countries can't produce food, and also say they still produce food because reasons. Your argument was that cheap US food makes other countries unable to develop their own agriculture. That is categorically false.
Come on. 1) I thought you were a globalization guy, you certainly said so, what's wrong with the US leveraging it's competitive advantage 2) Of the US was doing all the terrible evil things you said it was we'd be broke and other countries wouldn't make any food.

Farmers are not guaranteed a living, period, end of story. There is NO price subsidizing. There has been very very very few price subsidies that have existed in a long time because we realized they were bad. There is ONLY catastrophic crop loss insurance that you CAN'T claim every year. The only industry that has a slightly different approach is dairy which now has a marginal cost insurance but only for small producers. 

Who's ag did the US put out of business? China still has ag, just not enough. Japan still has ag, but not enough. Mexico still has a ton of Ag, South America all has a ton of ag, Canada still produces a ton of ag. Where are all these countries not producing for themselves? You won't find them.

""When you shut down exporting routes and markets for a globalized agricultural industry you hurt them"" 

Get your argument straight. You can't say its not competitive and also it gets hurt when you shut down places its not competitive in.

But our production doesn't drive down global prices, EVERYONE's production drives down global prices. The US isn't flooding the market with cheap food, the whole world is flooding the market with grain, AND there is not a price guarantee from the government. 

Japan CAN'T feed itself. China CAN'T feed itself. They have a shortage, comparatively to the US, in arable land. Do you know what that mean? That means the US has a comparative advantage in producing food and SHOULD produce food and that food WILL be competitive because those foreign powers have a competitive advantage in manufacturing. If anything, based on your idea that globalization is the answer, the US should produce MORE food and should do away with manufacturing. THAT would be globalization.

So you hate US ag because it produces a globally competitive food crop in wheat, corn, and beef but you hate US ag because they overproduce food when you shut off their foreign markets? At least come up with a cohesive argument for globalization."

The government doesn't have allowances for feed production.

The tax rates ARE THE SAME. They're literally corporate tax rates. There is no ""agricultural tax scale"". Here's a reason why it has to be that way. Say, hypothetically, I've lived in Billings Montana my whole life and produced ag products, for most my life the land was not valued very high even as housing ground. It's been valued at what it is worth with no housing sites (which are not that easy to get) and no infrastructure only as production ground. Now in 2005+ people start moving to Billings in Mass because some idiot posted it was a great city in a survey. Housing prices rise dramatically. Should I be TAXED out of my home and my ground?

Let's take a different example. In Coeur d'Alene Idaho retirees are having to sell the house they have lived in for 70 years  because people suddenly decided to move there around 2000 and shot up home prices. Is that okay? 

Tell me how are those scenarios any different?

Also, you pay capital gains taxes on land, you don't have to do that with most business assets. What do you mean they have no motivation to sell? If they are bankrupt they lose it. 

Anyone will tell you land is not a typical business asset. It generally doesn't depreciate. Why is that a bad thing? Why do you keep saying farmers are unproductive? We literally produce the most food the most efficiently of any country in the world.

Also literally every developed country in the whole damn world subsidizes food production, the US does it significantly less than Europe. 

Why are you acting like owning land is an evil thing?"
todayilearned,fctl5ca,t1_fcthag6,1577947308.0,"I never said farmers we're destitute. I never acted like they were. We gross between 900k and 1.3 Mil a year. But guess what? Like I told you earlier it takes a million dollars to run the farm. What that means is on most years I can plan on making about $150k for the business, my salary is typically $50k and the rest is reinvestment. There are years when we lose $100k. There is no other industry so vital that also has such rapid cycles of boom and bust. I didn't say we wouldn't survive. If you fucking listened I told you I'm solvent AND that I've never touched crop insurance.

Also my 2 acres in the middle of BFE was cheaper than most 1 bedroom apartments in the urban shit holes on our coasts. That doesn't make me poor or rich or whatever, it means I live somewhere with a low cost of living.

I don't even raise beef. BTW but I'd you think it's easy to get anything agricultural zoned now days including these wetlands you're talking about us destroying you need to get with the times. It's not your case.

You STILL haven't provided a shred of evidence that cattle grazing is a bad thing on public land (because it's verifiably false and is a commonly used forest management tool).


You obviously don't know how crop insurance works because you literally can't claim it every year. It based on your average yields on that property for the past 5 years and it doesn't even cover your costs. You cannot, period, make money off of crop insurance unless you are committing fraud.

Food isn't cheap because we subsidize it, hell sugar is twice as expensive in North America as it is in the rest of the world. If you again weren't listening there is no direct subsidies for production agriculture. You already said beef producers don't need it, which means it's an economically viable endeavor. Not only that it's a massive export, and there's no government anything for beef producers. What's your problem with these capitalists again?

todayilearned,fcld9hi,t1_fckyt5b,1577745128.0,"What I'm saying is you're spewing historical fallacy to justify your world view. Whomever taught you this shit is a moron.

You obviously know very little about Judaism, Christianity, or Islam or you would not think they are similar at all.

You've spent more time spewing insult and false statement than engaging any of the questions I have asked.

I also wasn't ever talking about religion in general, I was discussing Christianity that, when combined with Greek logical thought, created the world you live in today.


Stalin wasn't worshipped by choice. Mao wasn't worshipped by choice. The Judeo Christian God is.

When a state who forces you to deny all gods explicitly decides to kill people, they do so explicitly based on secular thought, on subjective moral reasoning. When a country where Christians live that is not a religious state decides to conquer some Indians for their land and then chooses not to kill them it's not an ethnic cleansing, it's not a religious cleansing, it is plainly and simply imperialism that was normal at the time.

Christianity hasn't called for cleansing in centuries, the Jews either. Several explicitly secular states have and continue to.

You wouldn't have Europe without Christianity, you wouldn't have the US without Christianity. The world as you know it would not exist but for Christianity."
todayilearned,fckyibz,t1_fckd7ta,1577735923.0,"Your understanding of history is flawed. SOME Nazis ascribed to a belief that contained Jesus of Nazareth but not anything about the Judeic history. That's not Christianity. Christianity must include both the Torah and the New Testament else it is, at best, a cult and at worst NOT Christianity. The Nazis were NOT Christians, if you read into the history at all you would know this. If you look at almost any scholar of the time none of them will tell you Nazi Germany was a religious state, not even close.

The Indians in the Americas were NOT killed because of their beliefs. There were some who sought to kill them because of that, but mostly they were killed because of the expansion of the United States westward. Up to the first world war that is how the world worked, the strong conquered and occupied the weak. The US cavalry killing the natives had nothing to do religion and everything to do with the expansion of the states. You can't even call it genocide or a religious cleansing, if either of those were true there wouldn't be reservations and there wouldn't be any natives left.

Muslims and Christians have such vastly different core beliefs you cannot lump them together.

Was Stalin wrong? Was Mao wrong? You keep saying that Christianity and religion is evil but the two biggest murders in history still forced secularism. Ignore anything else you want but explain why forced secularism has killed more people in the last 100 years than all religious conflicts throughout history. You can't defend them, and if you can't defend them you will have a hard time saying secularism is less evil than religion."
todayilearned,fckdz9f,t1_fcjks9z,1577723193.0,"We weren't (at least originally) discussing all religion, we were discussing Christianity. I am no fool to think no claimed Christian has never killed in the name of God. There are bad people that claim Christianity. But, Christianity hasn't called for a genocide or gone to war recently has it? Forced secularism has.

What we were discussing was the fact that Christianity, which he claimed to be immoral, has a grounded moral and ethical framework, which secularism fails to provide.

What we were discussing was the fact that forced secularism has killed more than 100 million people in the last 100 years, and Christianity (hell ALL religious conflict) does not even come close to the atrocities committed in the 20th century by Nazi Germany, Russia, and China along with their puppets.


The other person obviously irrationally hates religion and religious people with no understanding of their beliefs which, frankly, seems to be one of the things he's criticizing me for but is failing to make a cohesive argument as to why Christianity is bad and secularism is good when the data suggests otherwise in the recent history of the world"

If you read that article the Nazis we're far from a Christian state, at best they suggested a cult like notion of Christianity that denied it's Jewish origins (not Christian) and at worst there were extreme anti church voices high within the party (Rosenberg and Bormann). Himler was a pagan. 

The Armenian genocide was a Muslim genocide, not the same as Christianity. The ""genocide"" of the Indians was not a religious fight. The Spanish killed them, the English killed them, the French killed them, the Portuguese killed them. It had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with Empire building which I might also point out was normal in that day and age. Genocide in Africa is always a power grab by a warlord trying to extend his grasp.

Also not 100 million people in all of that combined. Even if you include the Holocaust which was definitely NOT a Christian war.

Even the crusades (the biggest Christian wars people site) were not a land grab or a resource war. The Muslim invasion of Jerusalem and the further attacking of pilgrims forced the Knights Templar who's job was to defend pilgrims to do their duty and go to war.

I'm not talking about religion in general, which you seem to hate for little to no reason you should go read some philosophy so you can make a grounded argument. I'm talking about Christianity which provides a moral argument and grounded ethical conclusion that no other ethical or moral argument makes.


What makes secularism dangerous is subjective moral reasoning, with nothing to ground your moral reasoning you can decide any action is moral (see USSR, PRC, DPRK)


Show me the ethical argument that holds up without subjectivism, show me the death tolls of religious wars against the 100 million killed by forced secularism, show me how Western Democracy which was built on the pillars of logic born in Athens and a moral purpose born in Jerusalem, is worse than China, worse than Nazi Germany, worse than the USSR.

My personal morals are not abdicated to another. My morals are my own. I make every moral choice, but I am guided by the moral principals written in the Bible, not because I'm scared, or I'm brainwashed, I've study ethics quite extensively. I use them as guiding principles because they are good. Honestly the 10 commandments are good things to live by even if you don't believe in God.

If you can find me a moral and ethical framework that is not entirely subjective to base a civilization on, please share so I can be enlightened.

Also there are no subsidies for your average beef producers in the US so your welfare state line is way off, at least for the rancher.

We subsidize oil because it's cheaper to make oil outside the US but it is a security risk not to produce it at home. We do the same (but different)with staple crops like wheat and corn. With those crops we have insurance against crop failure but not direct subsidies. We subsidize sugar because we basically ran out in WW2 and decided that was a bad deal. We subsidize the by providing guaranteed loans to sugar refineries. We subsidize milk because it's a staple, vital commodity. We subsidize it by giving a price guarantee up to a cap.


Your Econ 101 globalization is the best thing ever understanding of how the world works is adorable. I can draw you all the models in the world that show specialization of products and services is better for the world but at the end of the day most economic models fail to account for one thing, people do not move freely even within their own borders and they certainly don't move freely between borders. There will always be people who cannot take advantage of what a country should specialize in.


Also, to even further show how little you know here, the US is largely competitive in the global agricultural market and we export a ton of beef, which sounds like an economically productive enterprise to me"
