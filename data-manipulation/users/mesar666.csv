todayilearned,feampes,t3_eo69vw,1578950358.0,Lol indians are known for their horn habbits and gang rapes :)
Documentaries,fealwvv,t1_fe9jgxf,1578950208.0,Indians are usually commit “crimes of opportunity” and they need to know that they can get away with it. For first world countries these conditions are not satisfied. But if you are an alone woman in a rural area or after dark in india now you can be sure to get gang raped. It is at least what I have gathered from the news and social media. I might be wrong about the motives and their MO but that is the fact.
Documentaries,fe6qrv2,t3_enqo6q,1578901002.0,Do they rape as much as other indians?
IndiaSpeaks,fe6ozmq,t3_enwgdq,1578898776.0,I guess they had to get better at shooting in order not to hit others while gang raping innocent women. And these are the best rapers rapindia can offer.
