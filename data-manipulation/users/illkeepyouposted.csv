You're absolutely right. In a perfect world there is no excuse valid enough for hunting endangered species. None. But we don't live there. We live here. Where money rules all and a cheese puff curl has gained sentience, taken corporeal form and is running the nation. We live in a world with clients of Jeffery Epstein ^^he ^^didn't ^^kill ^^himself and the Panama papers and none of those people will ever face retribution - legal or otherwise. So yes,  we should be glad that *at least* there is a silver lining when there could so easily be none.

""Hey stop smoking asap, or I'm calling the landlord""

 *but I have to smoke because*

Not my problem

*but ...*

Not my problem

*but...*

Not my problem. I asked you multiple times before you moved in if you smoke, and you said no every time. I stressed the importance of there being no smoking in the house, and you still  begged and pleaded to live here. You signed a lease **where it is written** no smoking. You lied. I should have called the landlord the first time you did it, and you're lucky I decided to give you a heads up before I call. Like I said, stop smoking asap or I will call the landlord and tell them to come over (because that smell isn't going anywhere anytime soon).  I don't care what you do. I don't care how you do it. It is, and I can't stress this enough, not my problem. This is a smoke free apartment. If you don't like it move out, and I'll find someone who does.

----

Don't listen to what they have to say (imo this is where you been fuckin up).
Before a word is able to exit their lips you can say one of two things: 1. Not my problem. 2. You knew what the rules were when you signed the lease. Fuckem. They sound like ~~post~~ POS.


Before hand take photos gather evidence etc, when you talk with them **record the conversation**

But be polite and firm (they are not mutually exclusive). Don't concede a got damn millimeter. Don't let them punk you in your own home, you got this.
