I am so sorry about it... even if I am only a stranger, I wish you the biggest ""Happy Birthday!"", you deserve it.

I hope things will be better soon for you..."
depression,fdw4grx,t3_en7336,1578754930.0,I totally understand what you mean. I feel exactly the same way as you...
ArtistLounge,fdqxemb,t1_fdqxdtt,1578676167.0,Thank you! Same for you!
ArtistLounge,fdqxa51,t1_fdqwy3k,1578676092.0,"Oh no don't worry! Actually, I love challenges, so it is not discouraging at all!"
ArtistLounge,fdoobwa,t1_fdo3y85,1578609260.0,"I like the idea, it's exactly the opposite of what I do usually. I'll try!"
ArtistLounge,fdok3j9,t1_fdoexfj,1578606745.0,"Yeah, you're right. I have to take it seriously but easier I guess. I'll do my best!"
ArtistLounge,fdoixkm,t1_fdoisu9,1578606073.0,"I haven't given up yet. It's been 7 months already, I am pretty proud of it to be honest!"
ArtistLounge,fdohx1w,t1_fdohrpp,1578605488.0,I think you're totally right. I'll do everything I can to let myself go when it comes to art!
ArtistLounge,fdobajs,t1_fdo5g9o,1578602085.0,Wow. 1000 bad drawings are a lot. But it's kinda good to know that I will eventually run out of those. 2 bad drawings a day will do it!
ArtistLounge,fdo3c5j,t1_fdo2pq3,1578598128.0,"Yeah, I will take things slower from now on!"
ArtistLounge,fdo2gxd,t1_fdnxc8b,1578597670.0,"Thank you, I should totally feel more comfortable with mistakes!"
ArtistLounge,fdo2cnm,t1_fdo0dcl,1578597607.0,"Yeah I know, it's frustrating though. It's part of the learning process I guess, but I tend to rush a lot and a failure is a massive problem to me.
Art will help me to develope patience, I know that for sure."
ArtistLounge,fdnvxos,t1_fdn8alq,1578593936.0,"I think you're right. I'll give it a try I guess, it could be the best thing to do"
ArtistLounge,fdnqiyy,t1_fdnl9gs,1578590915.0,"I didn't know the art career was so hard! But you know what? It still looks fun, I won't give up on my dream. Thank you!"
ArtistLounge,fdnjb3f,t1_fdnh8f3,1578586998.0,"Those are really original and useful tips, thank you. I will try to let go more. I tend to be overcritical (like every artist) and way too serious about my works. Probably it's because I want art to be my future job, and I am already 16, so I have to hurry up. I want to rush, and it's probably not positive when it comes to drawing."
ArtistLounge,fdnas91,t1_fdnact8,1578581730.0,"I did some gestural drawings, but I still find it hard to draw shadows and I still haven't learned body language. I thought I could learn it when I needed a specific expression, but maybe I should learn it right away."
ArtistLounge,fdn9brx,t1_fdn90f0,1578580720.0,"Thank you!
Even though I am a beginner, I've been drawing for 7 months now, and I studied anatomy for all this time. I would like to do something different"
depression,fde0eao,t3_ekpvdz,1578328332.0,I feel you :(
ArtistLounge,fcjnlnq,t1_fciyb8a,1577695394.0,"I did some attempts, and they are not too bad. I like doing realistic portraits (not photorealistic though) but I prefer to stylize faces and bodies when I draw an art piece. It would look a bit odd to me. Anyway I am not doing an extreme stylization, I still want my drawings to keep a bit of realism.
Maybe trying to stylize real faces will improve my ability to create different forms to work with when I draw? Different eyes, mouths and so on?"
