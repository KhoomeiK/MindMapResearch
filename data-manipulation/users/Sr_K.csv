AskMen,ffhx10i,t1_ffhwn8k,1579957656.0,"I watched it in 2018 so 14-15, I watched himym last year and I liked that one a lot lot more, there's so much more change in the chearacters (with the exception of barnie which kinda made me sad) and there's a reason to keep watching, the story being told format was also done really well. But overall I prefer more unique sitcoms, arrested development is really good and has a completly different approach to jokes, always sunny is also incredibly funny and most certainly like nothing else on tv, community is too full of heart like honestly I didn't realize ut until my 2nd watch but apart from the funny part there is such a good emotional development to the characters"
AskMen,ffhqxa9,t1_ffha15n,1579949182.0,"Not really its just all so forgettable, I barely remember the ending but I don't think they get him back at the end, actually main blond guy just goes into a spaceship or some other thing because the aliens have a space base.


The good part was how you found out the aliens are robots, but need some weird thing to live so there's only 400 of them but more importantly, the reason the govt adapted in some way is because the aliens talked to what they thought were the leaders, the alien didn't mean to be bad it was all human made the aliens were just a tool, the aliens just approached the humans asking for help to make weapons to fight a common enemy"

By the 2nd season stuff is just unwatchable, guy literally says ""you could see a prediction of where the bullet is going so I just predicted that"" dude whyyyyyyy, im still on the fence about the bad guy in the first half, in the end hes just like idk dude.
