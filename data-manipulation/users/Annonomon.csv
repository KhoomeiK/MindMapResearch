I live in the first world and I won’t have kids unless I can give them a great upbringing. I’m not saying that if you have an unplanned pregnancy, or circumstances get significantly worse after being pregnant, that should not have the kid. But lots of people choose to have kids in terrible conditions and cannot adequately fulfill the roles as a parent. I think that that is selfish and cruel.

Spend more time socializing, outdoors, pursuing hobbies, learning or just doing whatever you feel like doing. Technically everyone is just waiting around until life ends, you can choose how to spend that time. If you can’t choose, try to accept and appreciate the moment. Live in the present, I know that it has become a cliche, but it really does help. Lastly, don’t look around at others or be resentful of the life you have, try your best to practice gratitude.

Sam and Eric are pretty central if not slightly left leaning.

If you went back 10-15 years, Sam and Eric would be considered left wing, and Ben and Jordan would be central.

His jokes may offend some, but they shouldn’t be offended because there is no hateful or malicious intent behind his material. Unfortunately, nowadays, many people get offended by the slightest of things. I think that comedy, such as his, is important for freedom of speech. We are getting more and more restricted in expressing ourselves, and I think that he is pushing back against that. Obviously, there is a line, and certain things are unacceptable, but like I said, he very rarely crosses that line and if he does, he will be the first to apologize."
