nfl,ffd31x2,t1_ffcxarj,1579812441.0,It does challenge the idea that he was robbed of MVP. Which is what I was responding to.
nfl,ffcvtdr,t1_ffcrf3y,1579808312.0,"Has a QB on an 8-8 team ever won MVP?

EDIT: A qb has never won MVP with a worse than 11-5 record."

nfl,fezurgd,t1_feziz6r,1579461921.0,"That’s so pessimistic. We’d need all of that to happen for it to be a blowout.

Rodgers needs a great game, the Oline is top 5, and the Dline has the potential to be a game breaker and Jimmy could definitely have a couple TOs.

Kittle won’t be contained and the run game is probably going to hit us hard, but if the packers can do the other stuff a win is very possible."
todayilearned,feyh29p,t1_feydf5k,1579445453.0,"Are you just referring to Blockbuster’s online service? Because Netflix’s had really fast turnaround.

They had every show and movie I ever wanted to rent and was way more cost effective than Blockbuster with unlimited rentals and no late fees.

I really could not have been more satisfied with the OG service. My family were customers since probably around 2005."
PublicFreakout,feyfz2a,t1_fextwba,1579444991.0,"I’ve done a decent amount of research about AB and it seems like the great majority of his incidents have come since 2017, right after the Burfict hit. I see he got in an alteration with a security guard in high school, but his recent activity is better described as psychotic than just being a massive asshole.

Couldn’t it be both, that he was always a brat but the recurring TBIs that come with an NFL career has pushed him off the deep end?

What other incidents have happened before 2017? Because I’m really not seeing much in the articles I’m seeing on Google."
todayilearned,fey832h,t1_fey0hct,1579441969.0,Snail mail Netflix was awesome. So much better than the blockbuster model of the time.
curb,fevzpez,t1_fevsl62,1579403521.0,"Seinfeld isn’t really Richard Lewis’ humor at all, Lewis’ is very self-depreciating and talks about his mental illness and alcoholism a ton in his comedy. If Jerry was supposed to be him there would surely be those themes to the character.

The observational comedy that Seinfeld’s stand up is famous for is the core tenet of the show.

EDIT: The second sentence of the Seinfeld Wikipedia entry says Seinfeld stars as a fictionalized version of himself."
curb,feu9d87,t3_eq7fur,1579384400.0,"Richard is Jerry?

Isn’t Jerry himself as the namesake of the show?"

nfl,fejy5mp,t1_fejxekt,1579188519.0,Yeah I’m from SoCal and we didn’t have an nfl team growing up. Not uncommon. Lots of Cowboys and packers fans because they’re always on tv.
nfl,fejx5yn,t1_fejvyvy,1579187886.0,"My family’s from SoCal not WI so the only other sports team I care about is the lakers.

todayilearned,fego7yu,t1_fegn8vj,1579098551.0,I enjoyed the sequel a lot. It goes into more detail of how the book’s world functions outside of the rich-elite paradise of the first book.
VintageNBA,fec5l7o,t3_eodsnq,1578966992.0,"In Bill Simmon’s Book of Basketball, he says that the Lakers players actually voted AGAINST trading for Wilt. Really goes to show his standing in the league at the time as a selfish prick."

lakers,fdqu2e6,t1_fdqs9ih,1578674884.0,"Not agreeing with either side, since obviously you can’t generalize an entire massive fan base, but this sub has changed tremendously in tone since Lebron came.

Prior to that it was much more optimistic, practically to a fault, where any criticism of the young core was downvoted. Now it seems much more pessimistic, despite our success. If a player strings together 3 bad games in a row, everyone is calling for his head.

It was always toxic, and still is, but the echo chamber is definitely different than how it was. There are far fewer lifelong homer laker fans here, which is what the entire sub was when we were garbage."

VintageNBA,fdmxop9,t1_fdlh73s,1578570453.0,"David Robinson entered the NBA at 24. It’s not surprising he washed when he was 36.

Shaq wasn’t nearly the same player in 2006. The 1996 version would eat his lunch.

Kobe was still a top 5 player in 2012 and had a much more complete repertoire of moves than the 2002 version. Many said that he was only getting better as his mental game matured, much like 2nd Cavs stint Lebron. He wasn’t “fading” until his Achilles injury in 2013. And I wouldn’t call it fading, more of an abrupt fall off a cliff.

But having said that, 2002 was his 6th season, so I don’t know why you chose that one for this discussion as opposed to 99-00 or something."
