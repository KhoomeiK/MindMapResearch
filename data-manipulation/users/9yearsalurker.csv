pettyrevenge,fdrwusv,t1_fdrsqc7,1578690874.0,"My point is that the properties of condoms provide 100% protection against pregnancy if used correctly, within the confines of the intended use date. Saying that 2 out of 100 get pregnant while using a condom is inaccurate, 2 out of 100 misuse, mishandle, or purposely break the condom and blame the condom because their head is too far up their ass to see the truth.

Condoms should be used a frontline defense against pregnancy and stds and everyone should be aware of this info, and practice this. 

Also many religions preach abstinence before marriage, not just Christians. 

On risk disparity, most lightly educated women understand the risk of sex and the vastly greater risk they take on physically, psychologically, and financially if they get pregnant vs men. I don’t know what ire she’s receiving in this rather than lack of sympathy. And if there were equivalently obvious indicators that a man had gotten someone pregnant, as to a woman being pregnant, I’m sure he’d face more ire from society."
