She can have the surgery to remove the offending soft tissue. Tonsils, sinuses but that tissue can grow back.

She can have her jaw broken and realigned to open up her airway. But that doesn't work 100% of the time.

She could get a mouth guard that pulls her lower jaw forward in order to open up her airway. But that doesn't work with people with severe sleep apnea.

If you're in a house buy some motion activated sprinklers they work great at keeping animals out of your yard. But they will break if left out in freezing weather.

Have you changed litter types? How many boxes do you have? Have you changed from say a box with a hood to one with out or vice versa?

You may have to try different types of brushes. Some of our long haired foster cats had very fine, floofy fur that none of the brushes I had, could get the loose fur off well. Maybe ask the groomer you take her to what brush works best for her hair.

Also, you will probably want them to shave her butt area. Some places call it a hygene cut. Poop will tend to get caught in the fur.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fd7pisq,t1_fd7liwl,1578208080.0,I had the urge once. There was a woman (white) sitting next to me at the Oncologist. Her hair had to be regrowth post chemo because it was the whitest of white I've ever seen and it lay on her head like the chest feathers of a goose. It was so beautiful!

AMA,fd74wdy,t1_fd6yd32,1578199472.0,Thank you for the confirmation. I actually saw a dog of my Granny's 40 years after he died. Ran across my path making me stubble. She said he came around often.

LifeProTips,fd3yx2z,t3_ejxwbb,1578162880.0,"I decorate my yard for Halloween, I'm THAT house. Last year a lady brought her daughter over during the day to show her that it was all just props so when they came the next night she wouldn't be too terrified to come get candy. I thought it was a great idea."
AMA,fd3xl9r,t3_ejuozz,1578162499.0,Just wanted to say thank you for everything you've done to try to make the US a better place. Much respect.
