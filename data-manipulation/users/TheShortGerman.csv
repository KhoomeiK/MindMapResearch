Grated parmesan and laughing cow are the only safe cheeses.

If I eat before 4-5 PM in the day, I will end up binging and purging.

Once I binge on a food, it is no longer safe and cannot be in the house.

Unsweetened vanilla almond milk, flour, sugar, and cocoa powder aren't safe and can't be in the house because I can use them to bake or make waffles. Ditto for peanutbutter or butter. But powdered milk or PBFit are A-ok. 

Egg whites aren't safe because I can bake with them easily but whole eggs are safe.

Low fat cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, and mayo. 

No real sugar, only stevia and skinny syrups.

No bread or bread-like products (crackers, etc) are safe.

20 calories per 2 cups of SF jello is safe, but when the store only has the 40 cals per 2 cups SF jello, I will cry in the aisle.

Only the Pinata apple hybrid is safe. No other apples will do.

Only foods that require prep (actual cooking) are safe. No chips, cereal, etc. Whole foods like beans, lean meats, vegetables, fruits, and specific cheeses are safe.

Bananas aren't worth the calories.

I can't portion control anymore. So if I buy a box of pasta, bag of cereal, pretzels, and so on, I feel compelled to eat the whole thing in a binge. So i have to buy my unsafe foods in single or smaller servings because I will eat the entire thing in one go.
