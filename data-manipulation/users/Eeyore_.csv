DonutMedia,ffbu1m6,t1_ffb8wcz,1579782728.0,"Let’s assume your 30 year old small block 305 doesn’t need a bottom end rebuild through some miracle. To get any real power out of it, these things barely made 150 hp and 200 lb ft stock, you’ll need some new heads, Holley dominator EFI, and intake. You’re looking at $2,000 right there, to hit 200-220 hp. 

I’ve owned 6 3rd generation Camaros and Firebirds. I can, by myself, with a concrete pad, hand tools, and a hydraulic jack and engine hoist, pull the engine and 700r4 trans in about 2 hours. 

I can go to a pick ‘n’ pull and have an LS + 4l60 out of a truck in 4 hours, including wiring harness and ECU. Total cost, $600-$1,000. Even a stock 4.8 LS makes over 300 hp. To get there with the 305, you’d need to add nitrous, and the LS is already 1/2 the cost. 

Even if you chose to get a new k-member (You wouldn’t need to if you got a Holley aftermarket oil pan and kept the truck exhaust manifolds) you’re still under $1,000 for a k-member + motor mounts. 

If you did spray the 305, you could buy a new LS wiring harness for $600, roughly the cost of a 100 hp wet nitrous kit. But, if you spray the 305, you’re going to need a bottom end rebuild, which is going to run another $500-$1,000 in parts.

Fuel lines and fuel pump for the LS swap run you about $100 and take less than an hour to swap in.

Unless you’re trying to make a Concourse IROC, the LS swap is the smart decision financially and mechanically, hands down."

I got lunch at a grocery store salad bar, and piled on beets. Then I got on a plane and flew to another city for some meetings. That night, I’m in my hotel room, and my back hurts, not too bad, but it’s noticeable. I think it’s due to the fact that my 6’4” frame had been crammed up in two different airplanes for about 6 hours that day. Then I get the shits. And those beets...they made an appearance in the toilet. Looked  like John Carpenter’s The Thing had a miscarriage. 

I’m on and off the toilet all night leaving crimson shits, and my back hurts, my guts hurt, and I’m puking after a few hours, and so my stomach hurts. Just everything hurts. My back hurts worse than everything else. And it’s like spasms of lightning pain are shooting down my back into my balls. My eyes are bloodshot from all the puking, and I’m thinking I’ve gotten food poisoning, and maybe I pinched a nerve from how I was sitting on the planes all day. 

Around 4:30 am I fall asleep for good, and wake to my alarm at 6:30. I feel better. I figure, there’s nothing left to shit or puke out. I’m through the fire, and while it’s going to be a rough day to make it through with only about 2 hours of sleep, I’ll just hit the hay early this evening, and all will be fine. As I’m doing my morning rituals, shower, shave, ironing, etc, I notice my piss is kinda red. I think to myself, “Wow, those beets really have some staying power!”

I leave the hotel and get in my rental car, and I notice as I’m getting in all the sore parts of my body. It’s just everything between my mouth and my anus, and anything nearby. My back is less painful than it was, but it’s still sore, still kind of a strange spasming, pulsing, throbbing, rhythmic pain from my upper lower back to my balls, to my navel, and my bowels. Just...everything is kind of lightly throbbing with my heartbeat and it’s a pain that I’m aware of, but it’s not debilitating, and it’s above pulled/over exercised muscles, but it’s below torn muscle levels of pain. So I John Wayne up and start driving to work for the day. 

I make it about a mile down the road, I go over some expansion joints for a bridge, and suddenly the pain going from my lower back to my balls is critical. I’m fine, I’m fine, bump-bump over the expansion joint aaaand I’m done, folks. I’m in tunnel vision, panting, sweating, nauseated, “oh fuck, did I just rupture a disc or sit on a fucking knife?” pain. I’m in life threatening, I might pass out while driving this car pain. 

Fortunately, my hotel was directly across the street from the hospital, and I’m maybe 1 mile away. So I immediately flip a u-turn and head to the hospital. Things are very narrow here, colors washing out. I call my coworker I’m meeting for this assignment, he doesn’t answer, and I leave him a voice message, “I’m going to the emergency room. I won’t be in on time, IDK if I’ll be able to make it in today. Bye.” I am bringing to bear every gram of concentration I have to just get to that hospital. I follow the signs through the parking lot to the ER, get out under the awning. There’s a guy attending there like a valet (never seen this before). I get out, and as I’m stiff legged walking into the ER I ask him, “Hey, I think I’m dying, can you take care of that? Keys are in it.” And keep walking inside. 

I get in, and see a triage nurse, maybe, IDK, a woman, for sure, in the ER, behind a desk. I pull out my driver’s license, my insurance card, and a credit card, put them on the counter and say something clever like, “Help me. I think I’m having a kidney stone.” They give me a bunch of forms to fill out and I say, “I’m incapable of filling out these forms, I’m in so much pain, I have lost fine motor control. This is life threatening. Please.”

She asks, “On a scale of 1-10, how much pain are you in?”  

13

She responds, “No one in the level of pain you report would be able to speak that coherently.” Another woman working at the counter says she’ll help me fill the forms out, and requests someone come take my blood pressure while we fill out the paperwork. It might be important to note that I’m in Pensacola, FL at this point; soaked in sweat at 7:30 in the morning, asking for treatment for a condition that can essentially only be treated with the most potent of pain killers. So, to these women, I’m presenting all the signs of a drug seeking opiate addict. 

I’m sitting at a side table while the helpful woman fills out the paperwork, asking me questions while reading off the forms. I give her a short summary of the night I’ve endured, and why I believe I’m having a kidney stone.  Meanwhile, someone comes and takes my blood pressure. It was something astronomical like 190/120, which is indicative of a hypertensive crisis. This means a stroke is possible at any moment from extreme high blood pressure. They both realize this is a legitimate medical emergency. 

Suddenly, the forms can be completed later. A wheelchair materializes and I’m taken to a bed. Side note, some sadistic interior designer or architect decided that what would be really cool would be, between the admissions/waiting room of the ER and the actual beds for the ER, let’s lay down a floor of bricks. So this wheel chair is going over the brick floor like a bucking bronco, and I’m near to passing out from pain. Each mortared joint between one brick and the next attached to a dagger stabbing me somewhere between my kidneys and my balls. Meanwhile the nurse that’s taking me to the bed is asking me how I can remain calm and cogent while I’m in what is now clearly an incredible amount of pain. I’m like, “This is what I can do. I can stay calm, communicate clearly, and get help, or I could howl and scream and cry and...and...what? Would you have taken me back here faster if I had behaved like that?”

When I get to the bed, they give me an IV, something like Valium, I think, and Dilaudid. I’d never had Dilaudid before. They monitor my blood pressure, and 30 minutes later, or so, my blood pressure is down to merely terrible, which is an improvement over the prior state of terrifying. The triage nurse comes back and apologizes, saying she thought I was just trying to get high. She’s filled out all the paperwork and has my IDs and credit card. The duty nurse comes by and asks me how my pain is, it’s now at a more reasonable 6/10. So I get another shot of Dilaudid pumped into my IV. 

The first one, it brought me out of near-fugue-state levels of pain, back to the world of I’m-a-human-being-and-this-sucks. That second shot took me to the world of orgasms made of puppies in my brain. Holy shit. No wonder people get addicted to that shit. I don’t think I’ve felt such pure contentment since I was 4 or 5. 

Then they take me to get X-Rays, which entails another trip, and a return trip, across the brick washboard, because fuck patients, I guess? In the end I got a prescription for 20 of some opiate that wasn’t hydrocodone, which I took one of and then left them in my travel toiletries until they expired."

PourPainting,fcwq474,t1_fcv1hc7,1578033264.0,"Your pouring medium, pour density, oil viscosity, and oil integration are all factors that will affect the quantity and quality of your cells. People are seeing cells from using Floetrol as their pouring medium. But the ratio and viscosity of your mixed paints will affect the size of the cells. Low viscosity silicone oil will produce larger cells than high viscosity silicone oil. Finally, the amount of mixing you perform to incorporate the silicone oil into your mixture will also impact the cell size. The more mixing, the smaller the cells. You can probably consider the silicone oil sufficiently incorporated into your pigment pour once you’ve completed 3 circumferential swipes. So an X plus a horizontal or vertical swipe of your stirring stick should be enough. 

Cells are formed by the difference in the density of the oil and the pigments. The pigments are denser than the oil, so the oil rises to the surface of the painting, and as it rises, it erupts from the lower layers, bringing the layers of pigment to the surface with it. This is why you don’t want to add oil to your top layer in a swipe. 

This is also why using a heat source, such as a torch or heat gun, promotes cell formation. Heating the pigments lowers the viscosity, promoting the migration of the oil, and air bubbles incorporated into the pigments, to the surface. 

The thinner your pigments, the larger the cells, but you also run into the issue, the thinner the pigments, the more likely they are to mix or blend. You likely want clear separation of your pigments, so you don’t want to thin the pigments too much. 

One nice feature of this medium is that you can pour off features on the edges of the painting, causing surface features to migrate and even stretch. So if you find an aspect you would like to retain or magnify, you can relocate and stretch it."

AskReddit,fcutbcy,t1_fcuezn5,1577988083.0,"Because until the 80s, high school graduation wasn't necessary to get a job and work your way up. In the 2000s the college degree became the new floor for employment with hopes of upward mobility (ignoring trades). So for the majority of popular media, college educations weren't necessary for mainstream, and becoming a doctor or a lawyer requires double the educational investment time-wise of even a bachelor's degree, not to mention also having a sort of apprenticeship in the typical career progression post education. Also, consider, people don't think in statistical averages, they think in specifics. If you ask the average person what an actor's daily life is like, they're going to imagine Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, George Clooney, they aren't going to imagine the 10s of thousands of community theater actors, or no-name extras and background actors who make up the majority. Add on to that, the average person's interaction with a lawyer is for issues of tort or defense attorneys. Your average person making $15/hr (or less) sees a lawyer show up to court, charge them hundreds per hour in 6 minute increments, and drive a BMW, Mercedes, or Cadillac. 

Just as media portrays lawyers as living glamorous, lavish lifestyles, it also portrays information system hacking as being exciting and fast paced, when in reality is hours or days of staring at esoteric code and log files.

personalfinance,fcum3ub,t3_eis9n3,1577983965.0,"I think the first thing you need to understand is that passion isn’t the most important thing. No matter what career you end up in, you’re going to have days where it’s work. It’s hard work, and it’s something you won’t want to do that day. Every career will have bullshit that you just have to get through, to be able to do the part that you actually enjoy / are passionate about.

You may have heard, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” But that’s not only a gross oversimplification, it’s a dangerous perspective to approaching life. Do you think Tom Brady is passionate about leading his team to victory and the golden moments on the field? Most likely. Do you think he’s passionate about pre-game training? Do you think he is ecstatic for every minute he spends on a treadmill or training? Doubtful. 

There are going to be aspects of every profession that suck and you’re going to have to endure those aspects to be able to do the parts you do enjoy. Being an engineer isn’t all invention and experimentation. And it isn’t all crunching numbers in a lab. The majority of being an engineer is sitting in meetings and explaining why the constraints being placed on your work piece result in cost overruns or design impossibilities. Or filling out paperwork. 

I have a friend whose brother is an automotive engineer. His big work product for one year was the door handle on the Mustangs. Not the design of the Mustang. Not the entire engine. Not the transmission. Not the cooling system. Not the steering wheel. Not even the entire door. The door handle. And he wasn’t the only person working on the door handle. In engineering that door handle, things that needed to be taken into consideration were how to assemble it. How to fit it into the door shell with the other components. A simple, off the top of your head design could interfere with the operation of the window mechanism. Which team needs to compromise their design to accommodate the other’s? What materials should the components be made of? How should the locking mechanism integrate with the door latch and handle mechanisms? 

One of the common sayings in engineering is, “Anyone can build a bridge that won’t fall down. It takes an engineer to build a bridge that will just barely not fall down.” In the door handle example, it’s simple to design the door handle such that it will last through 1,000,000 operating cycles. But, Ford sold 113,000+ Mustangs in 2018. If we assume the real operating life of a Mustang is 15 years, and the door will be opened and closed 10 times a day, the real expected lifetime duty cycles for a door handle is 15 x 365 x 10 = 54,750 times. So if we apply some actuarial science to the problem, we can probably safely design a door handle that has a mean time to failure of around 75,000 duty cycles. Now we can design some of those components of our door handle mechanism thinner or from cheaper materials. We might choose plastic, and a specific plastic at that, to compose a component, because it’s $0.15 per unit vs $0.50 for a stamped metal part. Just that decision saved $0.35 x 2 x 113,000 = $79,100 on the annual production run of Ford Mustangs. Ford has sold over 500,000 of the current generation of mustangs, so that single $0.35 savings on that one component has saved Ford over $350,000 on the total production costs of the Mustangs over the life of the model to date.

I’ve just thrown all of that out here in a few minutes of hypotheticals, but realize that the choice of the material to cast that component requires meetings with the Senior Door Design Engineer for Mustang, the assembly engineer, the suppliers engineering teams, documenting acceptable tolerances, testing the design to destruction, the R&D team, the testing team, the tooling team. And none of this takes into consideration coworker Jerry who is pissed his design didn’t get selected, so he’s either being salty in every meeting, or scheduling meetings to try to get his design selected. And somewhere there’s an executive who wants to return to the door handle design of their favorite car, so there’s alternate designs that need to be vetted as well. 

The time spent in CAD, or in tooling, or in design, or in whichever specific process in the work stream you find particular enjoyable is a small part of the processes. You’re going to have a rare proportion of your time working being the aspect you are passionate about. And that’s if you’re lucky. The vast majority of the 10s of millions of job holders in the US don’t have any particular part of their job they’re passionate about. 

Do you think garbage men are passionate about tipping bins? Maybe the guy who drives the truck particularly enjoys he gets to drive a piece of equipment like that. But driving that truck in traffic is a pain. Other drivers suck. Operating the big grabber arm might be neat, until you’re doing it for the 100,000th time. Then it’s just pushing a button on the dash. Move. Push a button on the dash. 

Artists, even, struggle. Perhaps the career that sounds like it would be the most closely aligned with passion. For artists, I include actors, musicians, and the traditional studio arts. The average income for an actor in the US is between $46,000 and $70,000/yr. That’s for those who are able to find full time work as an actor. There are plenty more who are incredibly passionate about acting, but either aren’t actually skilled in it, are in a geographic location that they work isn’t available for them to be employed full time, or haven’t quite “made it” yet. There are musicians who are passionate about their instruments or lyrics who aren’t rock stars, and make their way playing live music in restaurants, hotels, or the like. They’re passionate about one aspect of their career, but there are tons of things that they tolerate to be able to experience the rarer component they love. 

Passion is a weak foundation to build your career, your life’s work, on. If you’re only doing something because you’re passionate about it, the moment you start to face these challenges, the passion may fade or be overshadowed by all of the non-passion-feeding aspects. And now where’s the motivation?

Recognize that the things we are passionate about might not be the things we have the best aptitude or ability in. With that perspective, maybe you can find satisfaction in your work by excellence, and not passion. For myself, I’m passionate about the ocean. I’m passionate about animals. But I have a great aptitude for logic and math. When I went to college, I wanted to be a marine biologist. Turns out I was way better at mathematics than I was at biology. If I were to pursue a career based on my passions, I’d maybe be a dog trainer today. But instead I work in the tech industry. I’m far more able to pursue my passions, not because I have found a career that surrounds me with my passions every day, but because I most efficiently use my skills, talents, and abilities in the market today to do work that permits me to pursue my passions on my own time. 

I am skilled and experienced at designing and building complex systems of processes. I’m not very passionate about this. I have an aptitude, and the market has a need for those skills. I don’t hate what I do, but I don’t wake up every day thinking, “FUCK YEAH, I’M GONNA STREAMLINE SOME BUSINESS PROCESSES AND AUTOMATE THE SHIT OUT OF THINGS TODAY!” That’s not to say that I dread waking up and going to work every day, either. I am grateful that I am able to have a career that permits me to use my talents and skills to great effect and with great compensation. 

But my self worth, and my daily pleasure in life, is not based on the health insurance enrollment data extract I wrote 15 years ago, or the inventory control system I wrote 10 years ago, or the system I designed for some business use case in 2019. I don’t particularly care about those problems. Which I would say is what gives me the clarity to operate on them efficiently, and why I’m not dissatisfied with the fact that I’m not doing something I’m passionate about. Because my motivation for working is to earn an income, not to stimulate pleasure. 

Everyone has to work to survive (ignoring generationally wealthy) and it’s so rare to find that intersection of passion, aptitude, and value, that it’s most realistic to expect you’ll only get 2 out of those 3. If you can pursue a career in a field you don’t hate, that you have an aptitude for, and that is valuable, that’s a net win."
AskReddit,fcudfaq,t1_fcu455e,1577978355.0,"In the US, a medical technician is a trade school non-degree job. Maybe a nurse, but not necessarily. You can learn to be an x-ray tech in 18 months at a community college. There’s a separate 2 year curriculum to become a registered nurse. That is, unless you were meaning an X-ray or MRI “interpreter” which is a radiologist. Radiologists are full medical doctors whose specialization is in reading MRI/X-Rays and diagnosing them. Today, in the US, a doctor’s office might have an X-ray tech who will set a patient up and take the images, and they’ll be able to look at the images and determine if there’s enough fidelity in the image to capture the information they’re after, but a diagnosis must come from a radiologist. So the images will typically be sent to an offsite radiology specialist, say at a linked hospital, or to a kind of outsourced radiologist network.
