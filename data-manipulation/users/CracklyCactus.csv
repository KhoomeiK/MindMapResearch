StarWars,fdibepr,t1_fdiamgb,1578439173.0,"The problem with it is that there are missed cues and extremely unnecessary things that happen. Once if you look closely there is someone who spun around is on perfect course to slice Rey in half because she was slow on her queue so he just redirected his swing and looked stupid doing it. It’s not the unnecessary spinning, it’s how unpolished the scene ended up. 
Long takes look cool if done right and polished up"

funny,fc42ae4,t1_fc3kb0e,1577404748.0,"I'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that the Stormtroopers are NOT bad at aiming. Obi Wan recognizes their blast marks precisely because they are so good.

In A New Hope the stormtroopers on the Death Star intentionally let the Rebels get away so that they can lead them to their secret base.

In Return of the Jedi, the stormtroopers are initially once again leading the Rebels into a trap.

In Empire Strikes Back we see the stormtroopers not hold back and they absolutely annihilate the Rebels on Hoth.

The ONLY time when the stormtroopers are actually trying and lose is when they fight the Rebels and Ewoks. But I should also point out that the teddy bears also easily captured all the Rebels earlier in that movie and were about to eat them.

I guess what I'm saying is when facing Ewoks, be afraid. Be very afraid."

StarWarsBattlefront,fc39eo4,t1_fc351yc,1577384652.0,"The red needles that spin around in a circle near your cross hair are pointing towards enemy ships. If you turn towards one you will find an enemy

I don’t really know what the red triangle is (there’s lots of red triangles)

If the red triangle is outlined with red it is usually the enemy that’s shooting at you. If you get hit, the needle pointing to the enemy ship will turn into that triangle. 
Sometimes it also points to your avenge or revenge kill

The red triangle outlined with white is the enemy you’ve last damaged. It will go away after a while of not damaging them

If a missile is after you, speed up and turn towards the direction that the two triangles on the bottom in the circles are pointing and you should never get hit"
