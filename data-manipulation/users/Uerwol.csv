Instead of blurring layers, google ""layer masks photoshop"" . You will be able to strip away and add back the layer as required by adjusting brush strength and hardness. It's a non destructive way to achieve a mask and change it later.

He gave me some special nuts to put out if I see the bird again to hopefully bring it down to be nabbed. Hopefully I will see the bird and be able to alert the owner again as I have his number now.
