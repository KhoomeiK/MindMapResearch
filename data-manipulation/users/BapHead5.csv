Doesn't matter who your family is, they are more often than not the rock of anyone's place in the world. I worry for him and his future as it appears from here that he may not be in control and he comes across as vulnerable."

worldnews,fdha4xn,t3_elcb9b,1578418675.0,There is a link - because of green policies they couldn't undertake controlled burning of the land to reduce the impact of uncontrollable Forrest fires resulting from dry earth and foliage. What a crappy post.

Economics,fb7rjty,t1_fb7pnnr,1576597725.0,"Probably a couple of months at least so they can analyse the trend. Then extrapolate this out to a constant increase of supply. The UK has had a total net increase of 200k or so a year for 15 years or so. The lags involved are inevitable.

I would also like to know against what this scenario is being compared to, because they would have to compare it to an economy that has zero immigration over 20 years or so to get reliable data  which is difficult."
