Check out a [kidney stone](https://www.google.com/search?q=kidney+stone&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwieherwnpznAhVq7HMBHclKAOkQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1366&bih=643) and then imagine what one of those fuckers feels like scraping its way from your kidney all the way out your urethra.  utter agony.  

Birth is no picnic, but if she is telling  you that her experience is that the stone is more painful, why are you going to such lengths to question it?"

medical,ffewwcg,t3_esxskf,1579868830.0,"GERD can be controlled with a daily tablet. very simple. and you want to get it under control as it is primary indicator for esophageal cancer later in life and that is not pleasant.

Talk to your doctor. If it is GERD, working out what (if any) foods set it off and taking an appropriate medication will get it under control quickly and safely."

australia,ffetv1a,t3_et6iww,1579865272.0,Seem to be extra heavy in fuckwits overtaking in stupid locations this month. Also nothing makes me happier than seeing some dickhead doing a burnout/dragrace in a ute and crashing it.

todayilearned,ffeibtp,t1_ffehuka,1579849172.0,That whole show was brilliant. I think it should be compulsory viewing for all teenagers. Along with American History X and Shindlers List.  Life is too short to be War Mongering and Pissed off all the time.
todayilearned,ffee0rd,t1_ffedzak,1579844533.0,dammit. you are correct.
todayilearned,ffed0u4,t1_ffec78a,1579843574.0,"remember that scene in ~~Shindlers List~~ Band Of Brothers when they liberate the camp but then keep the prisoners there because the doctor had to stop them from eating too much?  you stomach shrinks when you starve over an extended period of time. *Edit to add* Your intestines and bowels get all kinds of fucked up.  Your body cannot handle all the nutrients and salts/electrolytes being reintroduced too quickly. 

 You have to gradually reintroduce food.  soft foods/soups etc first,in tiny amounts,  gradually increasing.  Then harder foods later on.  Gorging on food after extended starvation will kill you."
TrueOffMyChest,ffdutn3,t1_ffddj6m,1579829472.0,"HR represents the company. not the employee.  If they think the employee is rocking the boat by not 'sucking it up and being a company man etc' they are just going to get rid of said employee. 

Especially in the good old USA where you can get sacked for no reason."
TrueOffMyChest,ffdulvs,t3_estgtz,1579829319.0,"Take my upvote friend.  The expectation that partner free and child free people should take up the slack, work holidays etc just because they are partner/child free is fucked."
interestingasfuck,ffdtxl6,t1_ffdss9x,1579828840.0,"sure you can. it just takes the will.  Those houses have phones lines. someone ran the copper to them, they can run fiber to them. 

no country is ever going to be perfect, that is just silly.  But throwing your hands up in the air and saying 'It's all too hard!' is defeatist.


Wifi can't work as a fiber/cable replacement either.  Air has a limited bandwidth.  The higher the frequency (for higher bandwidth) the shorter the distance that signal will travel. meaning you need more towers, and those towers require power and fiber-optic interconnects and get saturated fairly quickly during peak times."
Justrolledintotheshop,ffdtk9m,t1_ffce86u,1579828580.0,At least. That's 1.5 million km.  Those things would be lucky to get 300k out of an engine.
Justrolledintotheshop,ffdtbxe,t1_ffci9zo,1579828414.0,"I have done 8000 km (5000mi) in the last 3 years. and most of that would be taking it out for a 200 km drive because it needs a run, otherwise it's 1.2km to the shops and 1.2km hope once a week."

Justrolledintotheshop,ffdsa02,t3_essshn,1579827663.0,1.5 MILLION km.  There is no way that can be the original engine or gearbox. that was such a shit car.
interestingasfuck,ffdrxav,t1_ffdrfia,1579827428.0,"It does increase costs, which means you have to be smarter about city planning and spending your tax dollars.  and if countries the same land area with 1/15th the population can do it, you can do it too."
interestingasfuck,ffdrqdf,t1_ffdegxl,1579827298.0,not for Japan. that's like yesterday.
interestingasfuck,ffdrpgw,t1_ffdasd7,1579827280.0,it would be pointless.  our winds are much higher (like 100km/hr) and we have flammable trees to fuel the flames.  These little things would be like pissing into the wind.
interestingasfuck,ffdrknw,t1_ffcqly0,1579827191.0,useless for us. we have flammable tress and high winds. nothing stops our bushfires once they get going.
interestingasfuck,ffdrgvw,t1_ffd2vrf,1579827121.0,"nope. They do it twice a year and system tests are important.  If they can do in such a manner as to create a festival out of it, that's great."

interestingasfuck,ffdr3nb,t1_ffdpf2i,1579826885.0,"You pay 4 times as much tax dollars for your Private health system for the worst health results in the OECD. This does not include Private insurance fees.  Just that money alone would cover vast swathes of new infrastructure.  

The Trillions you spend on new ending wars to keep the MegaNationals fat on tax dollars is also wasted.  

I could go on all day about how fucked the American system is, but I would be downvoted to oblivion by Americans who have been bottle fed the kool-aid since birth that America is ""The Greatest Country On Earth™"" and everything it does is they best way.

EDit. Australia also manages reasonably with with a Country the same size as the contiguous USA with 1/15 the population."
