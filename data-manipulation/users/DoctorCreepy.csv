Mine is more of a Discovery Klingon got down with a ridge less Klingon from the ENT storyline used to explain TOS ridge less Klingons (DISCO kinda shits on that though) and she's their daughter. She was treated like shit her whole life, much like the way Voq was treated so she said screw this, and went to Starfleet with everything she knew about the empire. She didn't have much more information than some ship deployment schedules she had overheard when she was basically used as a housekeeping slave, but it saved the lives of the crew of every ship that was going to be targeted and allowed Starfleet to lay an ambush for those few Klingon ships. A tiny victory in the early days of the war, and mostly insignificant, but it earned her admission into Starfleet medical.

I would be okay with FED Akira carrier with one hanger bay of peregrine fighters or something, but KDF should be the ones with the badass carriers, Romulans with cruisers that are almost as nimble as escorts, FED with the crazy gadgets and technobabble, Dominion with the ships that have escort wings and can call in bug ships...

sto,ff3vuac,t3_erhmpk,1579549965.0,"6) B.S.  one of my best setups mixes rep, crafted, and c-store ship consoles.  
  
My best build, for PvE anyway, is preeminent deflector, warp, and impulse for the 3 piece +30% tetryon dmg, hyper dual refracting tetryon beams, refracting tetryon DHC, wide arc tetryon DHC, Kelvin torp on fore, kinetic cutting beam, tetryon omni, nukara web mines aft, nukara console, ferrofluid console, plasmonic leech, advanced assimilated, house martok eng console, another purp eng I can't remember the name of but gives flight speed and turn bonus, bio-neural gel packs and a bunch of other consoles that give extra subsystem power, tet damage, etc, paired with maxed out (3 I think?) Purple projectile doffs.   
   
The idea being that I'm hitting as many targets with my tetryon shots as possible, watching it bounce all around ship to ship, waiting to see ""OFFLINE"" and since the only thing I'm using that can knock a system offline is tetryon, I know it'll be shields. That's when I target the one with shields offline and watch as my hailstorm of torps rip them apart. Hailstorm because my torps have a 4 second recharge... 3.5s after the ferrofluid console, and each one that fires has 3 separate 20% chances to reduce the time before the next torp by 5s. I think you can see where this going. More often than not, a torp procs the reload, and that torp procs, and that torp procs, and so on and so on. It's like the romulan hyper plasma torps, except kinetic and much more damaging. Especially with the target's shields being down temporarily. I can usually drop most ships completely in 1 volley in PvE and almost always come in 1st or 2nd in advanced queues with that build. Ship is fleet defiant, on eng captain. I deal a ridiculous amount of damage, but manage to stay alive through stuff like miracle worker, or whatever it's called now.  
  
It mixes gamma, nukara, terran, and a bunch of other reps plus mission and crafted gear."
sto,ff3vl67,t1_ff3ruea,1579549807.0,"I think with 5, the problem is that some people are dense and probably expect that the tooltip will somehow show higher DPS when targeting someone without shields, or that they'll somehow do more damage than their torps+skill will allow, when in reality they're doing *less* damage while the shields are up and then the *full* damage when shields are down.   
  
They don't grasp that their torp damage = base torp+relevant skills/traits/consoles - target resistance vs. torp damage type - shield absorption - skills/traits/consoles. When shields are down, the target loses absorption and any resistance granted by shields."
science,ff36bt4,t1_ff330tj,1579534731.0,"Not true. Maybe at the start, sure, but once you're on drugs/alcohol, the choice becomes food *or* drugs. And most of the time, food loses. Especially with opioid drugs since choosing food means detoxing from the drugs, which carries symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever, sweating, chills, involuntary spasms, and extreme joint pain. So if your choice is drugs, or food + agony that will involve puking up and shitting out anything you eat/drink anyway, food becomes a stupid choice.   
  
People talk about how you lose weight on heroin... This is one of the reasons. You can't *afford* food. As your tolerance increases, you have to buy more and more heroin until you're not even getting high anymore; you're only able to get enough just to stave off the hell of withdrawal."

AskReddit,fexp2fp,t3_eqpqjr,1579434281.0,"Wrote a webpage that looked identical to AOL's billing page, even linking directly to their images for all of the assets for my page because this was the days of dialup so in the status bar you would often see what was loading and where it was fetching the data from so it would say things like ""loading image: http://www.aol.com/billing/images/...."" Etc. I then used a program that would enter and leave AOL chatrooms and collect a list of everyone in them, it would do this for a few hours until it had about a thousand or so, which would then take the list of screen names (AOL usernames, which were also your email address), remove any duplicates, and then send each of them an email that was an exact recreation of the email AOL would send you if there's a problem with your credit card on file, except the link to the billing page was *my* page. The program also spoofed the email address it was sending *from* so the email came from ""Billing@aol.com"" (though if you knew how to read MX records you could tell it was fake... But people who could do *that* were not my intended targets anyway)  
  
The email, and resulting webpage, with a really dumb URL like aolbilling.cjb.net, but thankfully most people didn't turn off the setting that showed the page title instead of URL so all they saw was ""AOL Billing (Keyword: Billing)"" at the top of the page, was a page that told them that their credit card on record could not be billed and that they needed to enter a new card number. I was meticulous in recreating the real page that AOL used when this happened with one exception; when they entered the new credit card number and related information, it went to an email address belonging to me.  
  
There were two purposes for this: first was that when you were an AOL user which was far and away the most popular ISP in North America at the time, you could only create one account per credit card number meaning that if someone had a stolen card, they could only create a new account *IF* that card wasn't already associated with an account. These were called ""nons"" (as in non-associated cards) and people would pay good money for ""nons"" so they could do things like create free trial accounts and get 100 hours of Internet. The second purpose was for ""carders"", if the card wasn't a ""non"". These I would put in a text file on a floppy disk and place in a ""dead drop"" location, then go to a second dead drop and pick up a bag of cash from the previous week's cards.  
   
The people who picked up the disk with the cards would then pass it off to another group of people via dead drop, who would then purchase stuff with the cards via catalogs and the like, have them delivered to vacant addresses where yet another group would collect the goods, and 'fence' them (which is where the money came from to pay each cell below them). Nobody knew anyone else by name or face and each group was totally insulated from the next.  Or.... So they thought.  
  
See, I was in a unique position. I was 16, living alone because my mother was in jail, so when the feds came to my door with threats that they could make my mom's stay in jail much longer and far more unpleasant, I didn't know any better and thought they actually could/would do that. So when they suggested that I give them the location of my next dead drop for the floppies and where I was to pick up my cash, and this could ""all go away"" and be sealed in my juvenile record, and my mother would finish out her stint without incident, I agreed.  
  
Essentially their plan was to catch people picking up the disks or dropping off money and roll them on up the ladder. It worked. The organization fell apart after that.   
  
Wasn't all roses after that though. They figured out who ratted and I got quite a lot of threats, though none of them amounted to anything because literally everyone in the organization were teenagers playing eGangsta. Some of them even thanked me later because it helped them get their lives straightened out. And the experience certainly did the same for me, as I never committed another ""cyber crime"" after....  
  
... That you can prove."

Showerthoughts,fem1him,t1_fekxmld,1579236696.0,"That's the thing... *Anyone* can be trained to use a lightsaber without hurting or killing themselves. Grievous being a cyborg only helped him in the sense that if he lost a limb while being trained by Dooku, it could easily be replaced. I mean, only one Mandalorian that has used the Darksaber has been a force sensitive, but everyone after that mando-Jedi hasn't been. Pre Vizsla wasn't. Sabine Wren wasn't. Bo-Katan wasn't. Moff Gideon likely isn't either. As long as they know enough about using melee weapons or have someone actually training them to use a saber (or in the case of Grievous, both) they should be able to figure it out and eventually become quite good at using sabers. The catch is, Jedi and Sith will usually be better at it since they're trained in forms created specifically for the weapon. There's exceptions, like in the case of Grievous, he bested some Jedi despite his lack of force sensitivity and not having as much training because Grievous mostly killed younger Jedi, or laid elaborate traps."

Like how in the fuck do you get from where ever in the Southern District that Valchek put Daniels and Co. to places like the port of Baltimore in just a few minutes? I get why they tried to put Sobotka living in Glen Burnie, and the neighborhood they used in the one shot they did of Frank's house looks almost like it could've been one of the neighborhoods closer to Crooklyn Park, because that's only like an exit away on 695, but a lot of the geography of the show is a bit off.  
  
Though I guess that can be said of any show, and it's probably just editing that makes what we see conflict with what they're saying."
