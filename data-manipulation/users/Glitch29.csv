WatchandLearn,fgv9nef,t1_fgv5fzm,1581141521.0,"This video was incredibly frustrating to watch, knowing that almost every part of the process was staged for video in a different way than it was actually done.

The pile of ""clipped"" matches was all unclipped matches. Even at that, it was just a propped-up layer of matches. A full cone-shaped pile of matches would be hanging off of the table.

The ""cut"" with the razor wasn't going through the cardboard. The donut he cut out didn't have the same dimensions as the ones that were actually used.

The red pile of powder was again, too big. It was clearly a powder from a different manufacturing process, not the fragmented shavings that were coming from the match heads.

Pretty much the only thing that was accurately represented was the assembly of the completed rings."

That clue would completely turn me off of puzzles from that setter.

hearthstone,fgricou,t1_fgr412y,1581047550.0,"They don't address it directly, but 2020's set themes would have been fairly well established by the time Uldum came out.

There wasn't really a chance for them to have feedback on the year-long narrative format before deciding whether to commit to it again.

It makes sense that even if it were a booming success, there would have to be a gap year between the successful trial run and a permanent implementation."

I haven't seen a lab that holds a candle to huskies in that department."
customhearthstone,fgk1rus,t1_fgiwdw5,1580855715.0,"I don't understand why people suggest sidegrades without any articulable design reason.

Most ""X should Y"" comments that don't provide reasoning have an implied power level concern. But suggesting a sidegrade implies that there is no power level objection."
comics,fghy23o,t1_fgg2k3l,1580797539.0,Nice.
Bellingham,fghxjus,t1_fgh31ir,1580797033.0,"Statistically, neo-nazis are much more likely to be middle-aged.

Young people haven't failed enough at life to decide they need to blame it on someone else."
customhearthstone,fghd3hb,t1_fggut28,1580782155.0,"The ""15 rounds down to 0"" argument is a bit silly if you ask me.

Losing by running out of health is a problem for any hero, whether or not it's been replaced by Jaraxxus. The only time that Jaraxxus is particularly problematic is against a deck with 15+ damage of pure burst that isn't otherwise pressuring the opponent's life total.

That type of deck is much rarer now than it was at any other point in Hearthstone's history. And it doesn't overlap much with Zephrys decks, which generally can only burst from hand for 6.

Jaraxxus was a very meta-dependant card. But there's a huge difference between being risky in some matchups to being stone dead against 25% of the field."

hearthstone,fg76rmb,t1_fg6wezm,1580585318.0,Yeah. OP was too busy getting browned to keep careful track of the attack sequence.

But I'm a sucker for consistent templating."
