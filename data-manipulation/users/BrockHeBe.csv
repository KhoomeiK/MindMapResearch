Until the age of around 6, she was mostly nonvocal and would often run in circles. As an early teenager, she seems more developmentally normal although she is 90% wrapped in her own world. She likes video games and characters from similar sources like many kids do. However, she doesn’t appear to groom well and I worry that she can be the target of bullying due to her atypical and unflattering appearance.
