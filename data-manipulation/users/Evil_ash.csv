trashy,ffwti00,t1_ffwlk3i,1580310633.0,"I mean, everyone these days going ass to mouth with strangers they met online. This lady eating cake probably isn't the most hygienic thing, but you know."
Aquariums,ffmnarh,t3_eu0kgd,1580056868.0,"I had a honey gourami that I had to set up in a ten gallon too. He also, was a jerk haha. 

Cute little shit though."
dogs,ffhgo13,t1_fffqp4d,1579934436.0,"I live rurally-and people just let their dogs do whatever they frigging want. It's incredibly frustrating. There is one dog (who I discovered is called Brooklyn because her owner is always half-heartedly yelling her name as she roams around the middle of the road), who constantly harasses my dogs at my gate-for hours. 

No one uses leashes, and again-they all run up to my fence and aggressively bother my dogs. 

Sigh."
