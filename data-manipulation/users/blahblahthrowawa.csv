aww,fe7u94a,t1_fe6277u,1578919324.0,"There are lots of name differences between the original French and English versions, mostly bc a lot of the names are a play on words that wouldn’t make sense.
 
“Dupont” and “Dupond” are not only unfamiliar names to most English speakers, they’d be pronounced differently — so instead they’re “Thomson” and “Thompson.”
 
Similarly, Prof. Tournesol is a silly name but doesn’t sound that silly if you don’t know French (so his name is Prof. Calculus in the English version).
 
Milou/Snowy is the exception here —“Marie-Louise” was the creator’s first girlfriend and “Milou” is kind of a nickname/shorthand for that. Well not only would an English speaker not get that, they’d probably pronounce it like “Milo.”"
AmItheAsshole,fdpk0gc,t1_fdo59b7,1578630730.0,"> Often the “NTA” verdicts on this sub do not coincide with reality.
 
I sometimes wonder if this sub is just a training ground for highly advanced AI who have figured out how to (on the surface) sound like real people, but are still working in developing empathy and an understanding of the real world."

AmItheAsshole,fdj3812,t1_fdj0kcd,1578457257.0,"Thank you! Yes, he’s an asshole but I feel like everybody is letting OP off the hook (give me a chance to explain!).
 
I mean just imagine you’re on a date and you’re heading home with them, and all of a sudden they start to allude to something about you that’s so personal and intimate — wouldn’t you be freaked out??
 
Now imagine being as insecure as this guy, and it’s the one thing you’re absolutely terrified about being discovered — and, again, this is mentioned ON A DATE!
 
How paranoid would you be? What would you think of OP if you found out/believed she was telling people?! You wouldn’t always worry that the next date you go on also knows your secret??
 
Maybe OP doesn’t owe him an apology but she should at least explain herself so he doesn’t continue to worry that everybody knows!"
AmItheAsshole,fdhipjc,t1_fdgy5as,1578423484.0,"Yeah, that's fair -- like if I was the uncle, no way would I accept the $300 but I'd be a little miffed if they didn't even try pay me."
AmItheAsshole,fdfps3p,t1_fdfis6v,1578367288.0,">thinks that his ungrateful nephew and his wife are acting all smug that they basically won the prize for him just because they wrote the entry.
 
I agree with your take, but to be fair..it sounds like they *did* basically win the prize for him by writing the entry."
aww,fcvrq5y,t1_fcvpz6s,1578008602.0,"hahaha that's great -- I'm sure your cat let himself get ""trapped""
 
I also think some cats just know who ""their people"" are and can tell which ones they need to protect/be gentle with (babies & little kids) and who they can tell to fuck off when they want (the adults)."
TheStrokes,fcvr755,t1_fcvih3h,1578008261.0,"Yeah, everyone keeps mentioning the band dynamic at the time of the album and I'm sure that's a big part of it.
 
But the simple explanation is that they just haven't practiced those songs enough."
aww,fcvpq6c,t1_fcvlwrt,1578007317.0,"haha same for me basically -- my cat growing up was 12/13 when I was born (no kids before that), and he'd basically let me drag him around the house like a stuffed animal (and lived to be 21!)."
TheStrokes,fcn8gm8,t1_fcn0c50,1577805976.0,"Nah, the Stubhub view is deceiving -- I think because their ""stage"" is just a platform and set further back than it will be IRL. Try [Barclays Center's virtual seat map](https://brooklynshow.io-media.com/web/index.html#) for a more accurate idea.
 
I sat right around there for Elton John and it was sick. You're a bit far from the stage I suppose but will have pretty much the best full view of the stage from there (and any photos you take will be great). Plus yeah, the sound will be A+.
 
There are much, much, *much* worse seats than what you got."
AmItheAsshole,fc3ysrn,t1_fc3q0hf,1577402131.0,"> Maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time calling someone who justifiably defended themselves after years and years of abuse an asshole.
 
It's not just you, that's the general sense of this sub.
 
**However, you're all still wrong** -- OP is still an asshole for this sort of response, even if it's justified."
