todayilearned,fdtrdb1,t1_fdsnwtm,1578721006.0,"It's called Long Hoa Phat Nhi Hoi Temple on Pech Drive. They all dress in blue and white, and if you are wearing black you're already frowned upon. There is always a guy in the front fence monitoring who comes and not. They buy insects from pet stores and release them all the time. A large fraction of my mom's family (8 younger siblings) live in the apartments governed by the temple. Whatever the head master says they believe."
todayilearned,fdseaii,t3_emw9a7,1578700713.0,"My mom does this at times unfortunately, mostly due to the tactics of a religious Buddhist cult down in Houston, TX insisting that it creates good karma. The most disturbing thing about it, is the way they do it. In the example of my mom, they ask what she wants? Does she wish good fortune for her family? Does she want better mental health? Does she wish to be less depressed? Great, wire 4,000 dollars of your retirement money and we will release a bunch of arthropods, and pray for you and you don't have to do anything. There is no limit, so keep on forking over money. The more money the more prayers."
