Morality is subjective because it varies from person to person, it cannot be referred to without reference to an individual (or set of individuals).

Slavery used to be morally accepted, but no longer is.

Edit: one last attempt to clarify what I'm meaning. 

If I believe nobody should eat peanuts, there is no way for me to prove I'm right. 

You could say, ""well peanuts don't have a victim, nobody is harmed, etc."" My response is, they cause 200+ deaths per year and are completely unnecessary for survival. 

You could then say, ""well other foods cause low amounts of death"" to which I would say, other non-animal products cause unwanted animal deaths also.  

As you can see, there is no way to _prove_ that one belief is right, and one is wrong. We can only try and _persuade_ others to believe like us. This is the entire principal behind morals. It's how they work. They are man made, and man maintained, constantly changing and evolving.

Because that is entirely what morals are. It is what _we_ believe is acceptable. It is all entirely subjective.

vegan,fdm69kw,t1_fdm5kc7,1578540820.0,"I think if a person is going to bully someone, they will find a way to bully someone. 

I was bullied for weight, financial status, being in speech therapy. I got bullied for having the wrong kind of shoes. I was called Gay-than (my name is Nathan). The list goes on. 

The problem is the bully, not the tools they have. 

Not really trying to argue, both views are valid in their own ways. :)


Edit: to be clear, I think we should help the bully. They are most likely hurting. I'm not saying the bully is a problem, but rather that they are being one is the problem."
vegan,fdm5chu,t1_fdm48re,1578540177.0,"Meh, I don't think it's anything to get upset over. 

It's clearly meant to be a joke and not targeting a specific person, but rather a type of person. 

I think society can find reasons to be upset at just about any usage of any word."

DebateAVegan,fchmutv,t3_ehakws,1577651953.0,"I personally would throw it out to prove a point. I don't want my family thinking I'll eat their ""mistakes"" or their ""mistakes"" might happen more often.

It's the same reason I turn down the ""come on, can't you just take one bite of my new recipe? One bite won't hurt. I'm eating it anyway"".

But, to answer what I think you're asking, ""is it more moral to toss it or eat it"", I think they are both the same morally at that point."

If your oven is already hot, well that's a whole other issue.... Best to just do the old ""set it and forget it"". That is, set the oven to 500 and forget it ever happened."
