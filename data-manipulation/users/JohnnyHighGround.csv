secretcompartments,ffdn8vo,t3_esvvyy,1579824488.0,"I’m not super cool with guns in nightstands but I get the idea you’re trying to do this safely and I like to solve problems, so:

Suuuuper low-tech solution: tie fishing line to the tip and grip ends of the barrel, wrap some duct tape around the middle, scotch tape this “handle” to the back of that drawer and drop the gun behind it. Wouldn’t be pretty but would allow for quick access. 

Slightly less low-tech but probably the simplest option: Attach it to the bottom of the top drawer and just, don’t use that drawer. Open bottom drawer, reach in, hey look a gun!

Super high tech solution: U-shaped rail with bicycle-style chains, so that the firearm is mounted below the bottom drawer, but as you pull it out it pulls the chain, which pulls the gun to the back of the nightstand, up, and then forward. 

...neither of these ideas are any good, most likely."

LifeProTips,ffb3bre,t1_ffaakwr,1579750718.0,"What? No. You get to take the standard deduction **or** itemize. You don’t take the standard deduction and *then* itemize. So go right ahead and add that $12k back into your calculations. 

Also, if you make $100k, you’re taxed at 24% only on anything *over $84,200;* so, $15,799 of your $100k gets taxed at that rate. $39,476 to $84,200–just under $45k in sum—is taxed at 22%. Below that is taxed at 12% ($9,701 to $39,475) and 10% ($1 to $9700). This means that overall, you’re paying 15.25% of your *total* income in federal taxes. 

Also you can’t just “put $10k into a 401(k)” but that’s a topic for another time. 

I mean, yeah, U.S. tax code is stupidly complex. ...But that means there’s no reason to misrepresent it to make it look even worse."

But I’d also like to point out that Utah has the most hilariously dumbfunny ways of sidestepping these regs. Like, there is (or at least was when I went) a law that you couldn’t drink hard liquor except in a private club. So they had a signup sheet at the door that you needed to sign—and pay one dollar—and then you were a member of this private club for 24 hours or whatever. 

There was also a law that a person couldn’t have two alcoholic drinks at the same time. So if you ordered, say, a whiskey with a beer chaser, the server would come out with the whiskey, hand it to you, and stand at the table until you finished it, whereupon they would hand you the beer. 

Oh, and they couldn’t serve open bottles for some reason? So a bottled beer would be served with the cap *loosened* but not removed. 

Fun, uh...finds a way, is what I’m saying."

Turns out these can get layered with essentially soot, and cause the heater to flip on and off and on and off and it’s super fun!
