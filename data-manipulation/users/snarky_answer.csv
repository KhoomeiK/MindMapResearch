fun fact, this is actually a technique you fell for. The technique is to make people feel like they are better than others who would be applying and that they are the ""perfect recruit"" so then once you have the hook in them they wont leave as much due to things like pride, ego, etc. 

&#x200B;

They do the same thing say someone comes in with something like a health issue. They will say things like "" who doesmt have something that happened to them in their life, you should see some of the people who come in here that we turn away."" Takes someone who might be more apt to not decide to enlist and gives them that same ego and pride as the example in the last paragraph. 

&#x200B;

It gets to a certain point, usually deep inner city kids, where the recruiters basically switch over from your better than everyone to ""yeah your shits fucked but we can work with you and get you out off this shithole and allow you to do well for yourself"". The applicants then bite on the hook when they start imagining them living and able to afford nice things or whatever was their dream or desire before.

We did just that. It wasn’t till like 30 min later that he even asked for any info. He said we would need to take the asvab. I told him I already had and I had the score on file.

Seems like her judgement of the situation may have been skewed by her anti-psychotic drugs and schizophrenia, you know, the illness that causes people to hear things, see things, think odd/dangerous things. She didnt testify because she would have to be cross examined. Kobe did what all wealthy people tend to do; make a statement not admitting anything and then settle in court with a gag agreement for them to shut up.

They straight ignore measures that votes vote in or out if they done like the result.
