A moisture-wicking fabric has two jobs:
 
*one is quickly moving (wicking) sweat to the fabric’s outer surface and the other is drying rapidly so that your sweat doesn’t saturate the fabric.* 
The result is that you’re more comfortable because your body can regulate its temperature efficiently and the fabric touching your skin has a dry, nonsticky feel.

How Moisture-Wicking Fabrics Work

Moisture wicking relies on *“capillary action,” which is the movement of a liquid (sweat in this case) through tiny spaces within a fabric due to the molecular forces between the liquid and the fabric’s internal surfaces.*
