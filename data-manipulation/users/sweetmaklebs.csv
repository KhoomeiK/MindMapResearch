TipOfMyFork,fdsgwjl,t1_fdsggfh,1578702505.0,"The outside is pretty tasteless.  It‚Äôs similar to a Catholic communion wafer (if you know that taste) where it just melts in your mouth.

The original satellite wafers have round ball like sprinkles in the inside (similar to the kind you‚Äôd sprinkle on a frosted sugar cookie), which brings a somewhat sweet, crunchy texture to it.

I prefer the Sour version that has a sour candy powder inside.  Those are much better IMO. 

In the wide world of candy, I‚Äôd say these rank at maybe a 5/10.  I think most of the appeal of them is Nostalgia based.  But I have a huge sweet tooth and I‚Äôm picky, so I don‚Äôt know that my opinion is on par with that of the general public :)"
