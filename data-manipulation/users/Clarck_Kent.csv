videos,ffjt2je,t1_ffjaf5s,1580006185.0,"I used to be a reporter for a local newspaper and we had a stretch of a couple of months where four women were murdered in domestic violence situations.

All four had Protection From Abuse orders, or PFAs, which courts grant in emergency situation where a person is being abused. It's kind of like a restraining order and requires the local police department to confiscate the target's firearms until a hearing can be scheduled on the order.

We did a story on how the system is supposed to work and how it failed these women. When deciding on what kind of art would go with the article, I came up with a couple of ideas.

One idea was to have a crumpled up PFA order with bullet holes in it; and the other was to have a man's fist clenching one of the orders and have blood spatter on it.

We went with the second idea, minus the blood, but I'm still not sure it got the point across as well as the first one would have."

politics,ffcszbm,t1_ffcshs9,1579806635.0,"They don't begin arguing until Monday, most likely. House managers have another 15 hours or so for argument. They don't have to use it all, I don't think.

After that, the president's counsel will have 24 hours spread over three days, the same as the house managers, to make their opening arguments.

After that, I'm a bit fuzzy on the process. I believe there will be 16 hours for the senators to question the presenters, and then there will be debate among the senators on whether to allow witnesses, which is when all those amendments offered by Chuck Schumer earlier this week can be picked back up for debate.

So, the timeline will roughly work out to: House managers finish arguments late Friday night and the president's counsel can begin arguments on Monday, if the senate is in session. They will go for three days at the most, then there will be debate."

politics,ffanth9,t1_ffajodm,1579740314.0,"I remember when I was about 12 and my younger brother and I wanted a Nintendo64 really badly, and we asked our parents repeatedly and they said they wouldn't buy it for us because it was too expensive.

So we said we had a bunch of birthday/communion/confirmation money saved up and we could buy it ourselves, along with the necessary controllers and games. And our parents said that wouldn't work because we would just fight over it.

So one night me and my 10 year-old brother wrote out a contract that we called Proposition 64 saying how we would pay for it, how much everything we wanted would cost, how we would make sure we could properly share it, etc. It was about four pages long, and at the end we put signature lines for everyone to sign it, making it a binding contract as far as we were concerned, because there were clauses that gave our parents the right to confiscate the Nintendo for cause.

We presented the document to our parents the next evening after dinner, and there was some discussion and some edits. The biggest point of contention was that our older brother, who wasn't involved in the creation of the document or the fervent pleading for a Nintendo in the preceding weeks, was barred from ever using the Nintendo without the express written permission of me and the younger brother.

That didn't fly with mom and dad, so we cut it out in favor of more relaxed language giving us priority for gaming time unless our older brother contributed to the purchase fund.

We all signed it and the next Saturday, dad took us to Toys 'R' Us and we bought it, and everything worked out. The contract was followed by all parties to the letter, to the point when I was ready to go to college, we had to add a supplement where my brothers relinquished claims to the Nintendo so I could take it to college with me, six years later.

Everyone still had their copy of the contract.

So anyway, my point is that 12-year-old me put more thought into buying a Nintendo than Republican senators have put into the impeachment proceedings."
