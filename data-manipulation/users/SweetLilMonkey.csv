> Bernie Sanders boasts the support of 53 percent of Democratic voters under 35 nationwide, while Joe Biden lays claim to just 3 percent. That poll’s margin of error is 3.4 percentage points — which means that the percentage of younger voters who support the Democratic Party’s current front-runner could, technically, **round down to zero**.

For anyone who hasn’t read it, the whole book is centered on Frankl’s experiences in Nazi concentration camps, and uses that as the backdrop for the big questions. It’s incredibly effective because a lot of times when people talk about how to find happiness they are just bullshit peddlers trying to trick you into thinking they know something you don’t ... this book is the opposite of that, because dude DOES know something none of us know, which is what it’s like to be in a *Nazi fuckin concentration camp*.
