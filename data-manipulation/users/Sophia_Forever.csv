The fear you didn't list, the one that cuts _deep_, is the fear that you are being forced out of a community which is just about as instinctual a fear as humans have. Humans evolved as a social species. Our brains are specially adapted to want to fit in with the group because 50,000 years ago, ostracization from the group meant you died. Our brains have not adapted to modern social circles. 

Your brain doesn't understand ""just don't worry about it"" or ""just ignore them."" It takes a _lot_ of emotional energy to block out such a primal part of your psyche. It's clear to me that those things worked for you and that's great! But please be understanding that it isn't as easy as that for everyone. I don't know how effective this photo shoot will be.

Okay, first off, 1 John 1:9-

>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.

This one verse got me through a *bunch* of rough nights.  If you're ever afraid that you might be ""in trouble,"" pray to God and confess whatever you think you did and you will be forgiven.

But lets talk about who we believe God is.  God wants you to live a good and moral life, but as a Christian, your sins (past, present, and future) have been forgiven.  As long as we're trying, God doesn't sit in heaven and keep a logbook of our shortcomings.  So you don't need to keep the logbook either.

And you're afraid that God is going to be mad at you for being mad at Him and I highly doubt He gets mad at such things.  God wants you to be *honest* with him in your prayers.  And if what you're feeling is to be angry with Him then give that to Him.  Be angry.  Be honest with what you're feeling.  Let it out and then let it go (but don't feel bad if it is hard to let some of that go).

GayChristians,fdtt3oc,t3_emzjmu,1578721777.0,"I got to thinking a few days ago that part of the problem of discourse between affirming and non-affirming Christians is that there's a fundamental divide in how homosexuality is defined. To traditional Christians, homosexuality is a verb, something you _do_ and since it's something you do it can just as easily be something you don't do. They'll admit it may be hard but we all have our sin amirite? But to affirming Christians, homosexuality is something we _are_. It is not a behavior to be overcome but just another aspect of how God made us. 

If Affirming Christians try to mirror Traditional Christians by comparing it to something else, we would compare it to eye color. Imagine if every day you had to wear irritating contact lenses because the world told you blue eyes were sinful. And sure you're allowed to talk about your blue eyes and the difficulty of the contacts (sometimes, other times you'll get the shit beaten out of you) but you were _never_ to take them off.

In answer to your question though OP, it makes me wonder how many people have killed themselves because they were told they could lie or steal or murder. Because that number is really high for gay people. So what good fruits does non-affirming LGBT people produce? The only one I can think of is that it provides churches an Other to rally against but that's only good for those churches and not good for the Kingdom of God on Earth (and really it's good for their attendance and offerings but rots their soul)."

But the great thing about labels is that you basically get to pick your own. There are a lot of lesbians that have a complicated relationship with gender and go by he/him pronouns and I'd bet there are a lot of gay men who use she/her. My point is, your label is whatever feels most right to you. Say things out loud. ""I am a straight male."" How does it feel? If it feels right, boom that's what you are. If it feels wrong well you can keep looking. And don't be afraid to change labels if one no longer fits you."

I suppose I can't completely hold him to the fire of not wanting to take on the emotional responsibility of a daughter figure and I _suppose_ the case could be made that he also needs to maintain an objectivity but also, to see a young woman hurting and to just tell her no? Helping people emotionally is sorta your job dude. Anyway, I guess I'm not sure where exactly I come down on if he's completely in the wrong or not but I want you to know that you _weren't_. You knew what you needed and you asked for it. It's on him that he turned you down and it was okay for you to ask him to let you into his family.

>This must mean I've made him uncomfortable and now I've lost his friendship too because of my stupidity. 

No, you're jumping to a conclusion. The _only_ thing it means so far is that you haven't heard from him yet. You hear me? There are a dozen reasons why he might not have replied and while him being uncomfortable isn't off the table entirely, it's lower down on the list when you apply Occam's Razor (the simplest answer is usually correct). The simplest answer? He's busy. Christmas _just_ happened. I know you said he's retired but this time of year is super busy for everyone.

Now I know you're starting to say ""well yeah but he's usually prompt and..."" and while I get that, answer me this: What good is that line of thinking doing you? It's not. So stop. Take a deep breath, have a snack, go to bed. And that advice is from the Bible. 1 Kings 19 is basically God telling Elijah to eat a snickers because he's not himself when he's hungry and tired.

Then, if you still haven't heard from him by Sunday, send him another email as normal. In the last paragraph, you can say something to the effect of ""I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable last week when I said I looked up to you. I really value our weekly letters but if I have made you uncomfortable I will understand if you don't want to continue.""

Lastly no I will not pray that ''grow up'' and stop looking for a father figure because wanting a father figure isn't an immature thing to want. I will pray for you that you're able to continue your relationship with the Reverend and that you are able to find the figure you're looking for. But I don't think it's something you should give up on. I will pray you find peace and love and if it's in the cards, it'll happen.

Now, don't reply until you've slept. Go to bed. You may be looking for a father figure and I may be a year younger than you but it sounds like you need someone to be your mom and tell you it's bedtime and it looks like it's falling to me.

I love you, it'll be better in the morning. \*gives a gentle forehead kiss and tucks you into bed\*"

startrek,fddbn9d,t1_fdcu9u7,1578304318.0,"Well I was arguing that the Federation wouldn't violate the treaties just for different reasons.

But let's compare the RSE to the Federation. Let's compare the Romulus system to the Sol system. Romulan society is very paranoid and militaristic. That means their leadership is going to be way more condensed/centralized than Federation leadership. Say they're basically the same in every other manner.

The Sol system is/has:

To our knowledge the largest ship building yards in the Federation (Utopia Planesia (I probably butchered that spelling))

The seat of the Federation Government

The seat of the main military force of said government, Starfleet

One of the major cultural centers of the Federation

Multiple major scientific centers (Jupiter Station, etc)

The RSE would also have lost a higher percentage of it's leadership because of the centralization of it's government. Any leaders not killed in the Nova are going to start scrambling for power. Give it a month before in fighting starts even going as far as civil war.

Finally the hit to moral of losing your ancestral home is unimaginable and affects the whole species.
