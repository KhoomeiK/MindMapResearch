From experience- it doesn't bother me at all because that's not what they look like right now, plus it shows they're strong-willed and capable of changing themselves for the better.

BUT. 

I've noticed I do take notice if it starts to seem like they're starting to let go again. For example- I meet her, she tells me she used to be overweight, but is now working out, eating clean etc. Then some time down the road, I notice she's no longer working out or paying attention to what she eats. It's not a huge deal, but it's something I've noticed in myself- it's like knowing she used to be obese is making me more cautious to her going back to that, and if she shows signs of letting herself go, I notice them."

OP herself admits her ONLY reason for pausing, and, as she put it, digging in her heels, is the husband refusing to change his name, and not some sort of serious attachment to her own name.

Attaction is a big part of intimate relationships. It's what differentiates them from friendships. As much as we like to pretend we're more evolved than that, we're really not above our instincts. People becoming obese in the course of a relationship, for example, has ruined more than one relationship.

The difference here is that your GF had no control over what happened, but bottom line, you have no control over your attraction either. Hell, loss of attraction happens even if there are no accidents involved. I've tried making a relationship work despite no longer being attracted to her and it SUCKS.

I mean why does that surprise you? They're a company, they're obviously not doing it because they REALLY REALLY WANT to help u/dilqncho and u/46516481168158431985 get laid because they like us.

Plus Gold really isn't that expensive. Let's be frank, if we can afford to be looking to date around, we can shell out 10 bucks a month."
