 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/ejgjrr/each\_number\_asks\_why/fcxpzyy?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/ejgjrr/each_number_asks_why/fcxpzyy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

I'm glad this post has fared much better. Memes and quizzes are fun, but we need to have better discussions."

You really don't have to do this, but if it would help, you can write a little manual for the person they end up hiring to step in your role."

In my experience, after they ruled out anything that resembled a ticking time bomb and abnormal markers, I was on my own. Feel free to DM me if you want to bounce ideas off of someone, if you feel comfortable."
ChronicPain,fcz08z4,t3_ejkt8g,1578091018.0,"Sounds familiar. I put a plan together on my own, focusing on pain perception and functional patterns, but not sure it'll work for other people.

Enneagram,fcysvkf,t1_fcys0k3,1578086356.0,"Yeah I wish you didn't get downvoted this hard, because I think I understand the discussion you're trying to have. The delivery does have room for improvement haha.

Here's the difference between horoscopes and this conversatoin here: horoscopes are based on a birthday sorting you into something that people tend to wear like a badge. The list above, and the enneagram in general, is based on patterns you see upon self-reflection in what you are motivated by. It's an overall pattern, and not a hard and fast rule.

I'm not a fan of broad categories either, but that's where you have to start when you're dealing with something as complex as people's personalities. You can absolutely expand and add nuance after you have a rough layout of the land, all the while understanding that the map is not the territory so to speak.

It makes sense that you don't like this list if you expect it to see deep within your soul and illuminate all the things about you, but that was never the intent. Its intent was to get the ball rolling towards that discussion--I hope this helps you see that you are not at odds with what this post is trying to do."

Enneagram,fcy4yi2,t1_fcy26dm,1578074868.0,"It can feel like being stereotyped with lists like this. OP did say it was for fun and it's worth it to really hear that. It's a starting point for a discussion. It's not a list of set limits of all you can ever be based on what number you are.

I wouldn't call this clickbait because we get exactly what the title says. 

Since we're on a thread about curiosity, why do you find a list like this to enforce stereotypes, but accept the descriptions from the enneagram overall?"

selfimprovement,fchty5s,t1_fchl5we,1577654101.0,"Sure. I'd read the intro just to get a layout of the chapters ahead. They're fairly well-organized. Have you checked your local library? They might have a copy, or an eBook download available."
selfimprovement,fcfw0c9,t1_fcdo9ex,1577634272.0,"Yeah I didn't think it would get upvoted so much haha. Not sure if the upvotes mean agreement or intrigue. 

I roll my eyes at one-point books in the self-help genre, meaning that the whole book only makes one point, and the author acts like it's a one size fits all piece of advice. I liked this book, because you can sort of choose the strategies that you think will help you the most, and it's written in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously."
ChronicPain,fcacoql,t1_fcaanod,1577566859.0,"That's my situation too--the 'maybe' part. One more thing I thought of: I had this idea, probably got it from people around me, where being a musician looked a certain way. If I didn't practice every day, or studied this many number of styles, or fell short of whatever other standards I made up, I'd be kicked out of the club. It was helpful to throw out that belief, and create a definition that didn't feel like I was lying to myself, but also one that let me feel included in the music community in a new way."
HomeworkHelp,fca7id7,t1_fca6rae,1577564220.0,That's correct. Keep it simple! :)
HomeworkHelp,fca126u,t1_fca03pk,1577561290.0,"For the first part, it doesn't sound like they need you to say how big the angles are. You just need to say which four pairs.

For the inscribed angles thing: lets use the diagram from your question. Take a  look at the arc from point D to A. You'll notice that the angle DCA 'opens out' to this arc (it reminds me of spotlights on a stage lighting up the same section), and so does DBA. This lets me claim that those two angles are equal. I don't know what they are, but I know they're equal."
ChronicPain,fc9y54d,t1_fc9wf8l,1577559949.0,"Piano :). It took me a long time, but eventually I came to a place where I think people who still get to be musicians are keeping that world alive, and that's bigger than me and my pain. I know exactly what you're talking about, and I never thought I'd come out of that place. And then I thought if I moved on that I'd sort of be saying that music never mattered to me anyway, which is not true. I'm trying to pinpoint the thing that helped me move on, but I can't. You will find your own way out."
HomeworkHelp,fc9w1a6,t3_egu19r,1577559032.0,"I'm going to guess what you've got written down is correct, but I didn't read too closely because it's way more work than you need.

For this question, you need to remember two things:

1. two lines that intersect have the same opposite angles
2. If two inscribed angles share the same arc, they have the same angle.

Let me know if part a makes sense now. For part b, you can use these two points and what you know about the sum of a triangle's angles to find the angle they're asking about."

I still read about it, and there are some good musicians on youtube who talk about that world. I remember a time where it would have been too painful to see that world at all, but now it's nice to live vicariously.

ChronicPain,f9vwsbt,t1_f9vw1sk,1575681867.0,"That's fair. I always assumed that if someone was looking for exercises, they'd be in the r/fitness part of reddit or something.

I've seen people ask what others have tried, and videos have been recommended or shared down in the comments because they are specific to the question that person is asking. When it's a post for everyone to see, and there's a good chance that it won't apply to most people, that's where I'm not so on board. If it turns out most people here do appreciate them, that's not the impression I got, but I'm happy to hear that."
