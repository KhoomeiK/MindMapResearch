worldnews,ffet51k,t1_ffbvf62,1579864301.0,"Empathy? Assume you were born and raised in China, not a wealthy family. You would have mid-tier food supplies (most likely veggies) and be aware people ate rats and bats. Even though most of them don't eat those, you wouldn't think much of someone eating bats because you were raised in an environment were people saw it as food resource more than a creature that flies and does it's own business.


China is a huge country with a massive population. It's hard to maintain a healthy socioeconomic lifestyle with such big population. That's why they had ""1 child policy"" even though second one does not cost that much for a family living in other first world countries but media tends to represent different.


Anyway, I do not support the act of eating bats, dipping live rodents and chewing but this is how it is.

The problem is the buyer messed up the play by grabbing the ice cream which is not cool because the purpose of paying for the ice cream is not usually the ice cream itself, but to get tricked. Some people go real mad when they see this and probably he was one of them.

Other companies for similar positions offer pretty much the same money/perhour and the money will be distributed from the profits so there is no actual reason them to increase hourly wage.

Can't talk much about St Andrews but it's known as being isolated as a uni.

Durham is great and lots of my friends enjoy the course (compsci). However the uni has pros and cons. Unfortunately student demographics are not bright: upper class, privately educated, rugby ""boys"" is a thing. We have a collegiate system and every student belong to a college. Every college has their own socities and sport teams so there is a sense of community. I am from a fairly new college (some people are obsessed with the college being knew). To be honest it really depends who you are and what you want out of it. Some are known for being noisy, posh, old, sporty, new... The list goes on. 

PLEASE, please research good before applying since you are planning to stay there for 3+ years. Naturally I hear negative experiences about Durham which are true (and mostly exaggerated) but the reason is that people don't research as much as they should."
