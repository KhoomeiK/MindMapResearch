I ask because there's a professor I've talked to quite frequently who has actually kept me chatting for an hour or more several times.

So I am unsure of how this works, considering I'm doing a pathways internship this summer, and when to start counting years in service, but I'll be 27ish by the time I graduate and hopefully get a career position, if I retire at 55 with 28 years of service and have a GS-12 position for 3 years (high salary) It would be decent, and that's without calculating in whatever TSP I have.

IAmA,fdcen7i,t1_fdakruo,1578273028.0,"This is a great summary. I don't work in health care, however I did help care for my grandmother from the time I was a young teen until she passed several years later. She had always lived with us, from the time I was born so I grew up with her, and seen her every day. I watched her age, when she was younger and still active and enjoying hobbies that we did together, to her no longer going outdoors except for doctor appointments, to the point where gradually she had dementia, forgot who I was, had excruciating pain, and suffered from hallucinations/nausea from pain meds, all the while I'd care for her and she'd ask me every day why I wouldn't just shoot her and put her out of her misery like you would a horse. 

If it were legal, I would have. I don't understand the point in suffering like that. 

When she finally died I wasn't sad, sure I miss her but I'm happy that she's no longer suffering."

AskProfessors,fcxrg3m,t1_fcxpmji,1578069398.0,"At this point I may have an internship with the Natural Resource Conservation Service, under the USDA. The internship is for soil conservation, and they have several avenues for moving laterally into other positions that are similar. I am awaiting for the final offer (just pending background check stuff). I do intend to pursue that upon graduation, and the plant and soil science degree fulfills those requirements. If everything works out and I intern with them for the next two summers, they could guarantee me an entry level career position within 120 days of graduation. If not I will go back to applying for recent graduate positions and having more credits in various connected fields may help, because they have positions in agronomy, rangeland management, soil science, soil conservation, etc. Overall the requirements are pretty simple 30 hours in natural resource or agriculture, and at least 12 in plant or soil science courses. Which both of my majors will include."

If the beef you eat is locally sourced, and by that I mean my bf's dad raises about 40 cattle less than 5 miles from where I live, and butchers one to two a year, would that be considered much more sustainable than perhaps going to Walmart and buying beef? It's fed with grass, and hay bales that are baled within 10 miles of here and some of which the owner of the cattle had baled his self. We have the option to eat the beef from his freezer and we much prefer the taste and the fact that we know where it came from.
