1. Yes this is a potential issue. Perhaps the solution is to auction permits years in advance. I do think any form or carbon pricing that adjusts to ensure targets are met will make some businesses unsustainable. The auction system is just attempting to most efficiently work out what pricing level is required to achieve the targets. 

2. Only if they are a start-up significantly generating greenhouse gas emissions (and I don't mean consuming power or burning gas, those permits would be bought by the provider of the power or fuel). If you were starting a power generation company, you could purchase permits on a live market. 

3. this is, for better or worse, going to happen as the world economy moves away from fossil fuels whether it is a carbon permit auction or a fixed price, unless the price is set so low to be ineffective. That is the point, to encourage transition a to cleaner economy.

worldnews,fffgqgx,t1_fff65s7,1579883599.0,"I'm in a European country, but if you combine high income tax rates with a substantial VAT and excises, most of the upperish middle class would be getting close.  Add up your income tax, payroll tax (which is effectively hidden income tax, being part of the cost of employing you) sales taxes on the remainder for the fraction for which it is applicable, rates and 
excises and see what you get. 

The plan was to round up the top few hundred emitters (including, for instance, fuel companies - they get counted as emitters for those who burn their fuel after sale because it is easier to charge them and have them pass the cost on rather than every individual or smaller company who buys their fuel) and then have them bid for emission permits. Every year the number of permits reduces, in line with agreed targets

I'm already paying about 50% of my income between payroll and income tax, consumption tax, excises and rates. I imagine a lot of the voter hesitance toward a carbon tax would go away if it wasn't used as a way to increase the total tax take.
