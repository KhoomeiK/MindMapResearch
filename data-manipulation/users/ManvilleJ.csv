edit: 

In case some of you didn't know, the profit margin for a sit down restaurant is about 2-5%. So, no; the owner's can't just give the kitchen staff 3% of their gross income without raising prices. It would eliminate any profit and drive them out of business, which would be bad for everyone. 

Now, some of you are saying, why not pay the front of the house more too? Well, FoH makes a lot more money than the cooks and dishwashers. So why would cooks or dishwashers be cooks and dishwashers? Why wouldn't everyone want to be waiters or waitresses? Well, thats a problem because YOU NEED BOTH TO RUN A RESTAURANT. 

To those of you who say, ""lets get rid of tipping and make restaurants pay minimum wage"": How. How would you do that. Fun fact, the cooks and dishwashers ARE BEING PAID MINIMUM WAGE. wait staff STILL make more than them. And if waiters and waitresses got minimum wage, well guess what PEOPLE WOULD STILL TIP. but let's say you did somehow get rid of tipping, good luck getting good staff for Friday or Saturday nights. 

Frankly, if you haven't worked at a restaurant or owned a restaurant in the US, WHAT THE HELL WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT IT THEN. This is an actual problem in this industry and there are people and businesses trying to solve it.

it would have been cool if you could always board. If you try to board a fresh ship, the snipers/gunners could just shoot them before landing. maybe make certain angles allow for better success rates & lower their stats makes them more vulnerable to it.

1. mature to have a portal where requests are available

You should tell them it is a 120/hour now and if they're not willing to pay for it, they should go with a cheaper service provider. You're a **PREMIUM BaaS** (babysitting as a service) and if they don't wanna pay for the best, they should just reflect on how much they're willing to invest into their children."
Python,fcvhfso,t3_eip48b,1578002160.0,"You know its funny, I hear it all over ""python is has really bad performance"". Then you hear the instagram story, then people talk about developer time cost, then people talk about the cost of computing and distributed computing. Somehow some java developer hops in to complain about white space and a lone cobalt developer start muttering about the good old days in his rocking chair. 

The reality is, Each language is a good tool until it isn't. Usually, python is a good tool, but when it isn't, python is pretty good at bringing in the tool that is good at the job."

to state this another way, Simplicity takes a back seat ONLY when performance becomes a bad enough problem."

Personally, I think the whole point of all this living is to grow personally and make it better for the people who follow. If you want to work and you want to grow, for yourself and your daughter, you are the best kind of person. 

There are plenty of rich leeches who only take from society; pyramid schemes, financial fraud, the real estate collapse, etc. all come to mind.

I also wanna figure out some on job processing. I have some odd computational expensive testing jobs that run on a few people's work laptops; I want to move those off their computers because they can sometimes fail because of a lack of resources. If anyone wants to point my in the right direction, I would love it. 

Then some cloudformation. 

and then maybe some IOT or cognito. (I don't want to do cognito, but it could be really relevant for my job)"

learnpython,fcus91z,t1_fctckc5,1577987473.0,"sometimes having a made up goal like ""I want to make a neural network"" enables you to learn a lot more than going through the basics. If you learned how to make a neural net, I would argue that it helped you learn what you needed to get where you are today and find out what you are missing. 

This learning path is a checklist, not cooking recipe. More often than not, trying to do something challenging can help you learn a lot."
learnpython,fcuoqsm,t1_fcsxp8o,1577985476.0,"I really like this, but I think it would be beneficial to add a new layer (""Mature?"") between intermediate and advanced that contains:

 - SQL

 - Git

 - Code Quality/Engineering Best Practices

 - Basic Cloud Computing

Even if someone has mastered Beginner & Intermediate, they really aren't ready to work at scale or with other developers; whether they are full stack developers or data scientists.

A. query data

B. manage/share your code

but what I am looking for is a method to compare that's a little more generic. 

I do like your method. It could be expanded to solve any set comparison, by subtracting the mean from any set and then comparing. Then check if the counts and values are the same. Its still specific to stdev, but its a nice solution."

for example:

    stdev([0,0,1])==stdev([0,1,1])

They should be EXACTLY equal. I don't want an approximately equal as that can leave room for errors in more complicated algorithms and  larger inputs.

I want to take a formula and check that the inputs would be EXACTLY equal, not approximately. if it helps, I don't actually care what the output is."
