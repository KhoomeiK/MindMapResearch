Also yeah, you’re right. People do discount real mental illness by saying shit like “well everyone has anxiety!” Or “everyone gets a little sad sometimes!” It’s infuriating and dangerous and irresponsible and I also hate the general ignorance surrounding mental illness. Also, I do suffer from very real anxiety, an abnormal amount, I’m always nervous. Constantly. Yet I don’t consider myself mentally ill. Maybe I’m just misinformed, as I’ve tried to deal with it best I can on my own with a little therapy here and there. I suppose I could have a mental illness, but I really would need to see someone to be properly diagnosed. I just don’t know. 

I just think the commenter you replied to wasn’t implying that this person is mentally ill. I do think this show that was showcased in the video is cruel and ridiculous, but that’s what you often get on a cringe sub. Idk, maybe you’re right. But seriously, this is an incredibly minor discussion in the corner of the internet. It doesn’t really matter that much."

I actually just had a game in which I got [[myojin of the seeing winds]] to resolve with a [[jaces projection]] out.

I would expect a far-right Trump supporter you shit-talk this woman like you have. She’s clearly a victim, and has obviously been abused her entire marriage. She’s clearly miserable and is afraid to seek help, like many victims of domestic abuse.

“They print powerful creatures” is not a good argument for them giving blue the best suite of creature removal in the game. And yes green has a lot of good creature-based card draw now? How is that relevant?

“They’ve been printing a lot of good artifacts lately, they should give black some insane artifact removal!”
