ADHD,ffiujn8,t3_etr6nq,1579983077.0,"Maybe it’s your mood right now.  How long have you been on the Ritalin?  Did you have this experience later in the day?  It could have already worn off by that time.  Maybe you were in the “crash” phase so many people describe, and more drained than you realize.

There have been times when I look at my collection and think, I don’t want to listen to any of this, but I can’t say that I have experienced this consistently—which isn’t to say it couldn’t happen.  Maybe branch out, try experimenting with new genres.  You could also be more bored with your favorite songs than you realize.  I’m always looking for new stuff.  I recently fell in love with piano music, and there are some songs that are so damn powerful they almost bring me to tears.

In that vein, if you don’t play an instrument, consider picking one up!  Musical literacy enriches your listening experience tenfold, if not more, and playing it can be a very emotionally satisfying experience.  Piano has been great for my ADHD midb because it makes me use my brain and hands together.  Very satisfying.

Just thoughts from a fellow music lover."
childfree,ffi2l3m,t3_etrb8g,1579963235.0,"You’re not alone.  I used to be annoyed by them, but I’ve mellowed over time.  Babies cry because they need something.  Toddlers cry because they’re just old enough to perceive that they need or want something, but they don’t have enough words to communicate.  Kids, well, lots of them are bratty, but I try to remember that’s more a failure of the parents than of the kid.

Well-behaved children are a treat.  I love the ones I watch every Sunday for the parents of my Zen community.  They’re open and curious and learn so quickly and are growing so damn fast.  Now is the time to help them understand kindness and compassion, before they form opinions about everything and stop listening to you.  Maybe then we’ll have fewer bratty adults in the future, haha.

But still, I’m very happy to hand them back at the end.  One cat is kid enough for me."

Questions for you, though.  I'm actually wondering how much work one could do in Japan alone, as I'm contemplating moving there at some future point.  How did you get a visa in Hong Kong, or did you obtain citizenship?  I'm hitting a wall, because Japan apparently doesn't award working visas if you don't have a bachelor's degree.  Which I don't, even though I spent more years earning my entire college education than the average bachelor's holder.  Thanks, Japan."

Or, really, any freedom at all other than ""do nothing but work job you're depressingly shackled to for minimal pay because your body goes haywire if you try to do half the workload normal people function under and then after that probably go make extra money on a side gig to make up for it leaving about two actual hours of free time on any given day.""

technicalwriting,fffjx36,t1_ffd6wne,1579885561.0,"Thank you.  I don't think I would want it to be 80 percent writing, anyway, so that helps.  That's ALL my current job is.  Every job has its boring points, but it's not good when it's...monotonous.

I don't want to keep bugging you, but a final question.  Do you juggle more than one project as a matter of course?  One thing that drives me to distraction about my current job is having a backlog of multiple project deadlines at once, all of them clamoring for my mental space.  I don't mind having a lot of work to do *within* the project, just having too many to do at once.

Thanks you."
technicalwriting,ffclb6l,t1_ffbx6hl,1579801884.0,"I have indeed done some research, but my success was limited.  Like most queries, there's about a page of relevant search results.  And while free resources are a great idea, and a tempting one, I usually find myself needing a bit more structure to my learning.

My main concern, honestly, is learning about the day-to-day grind of the job.  I've made several career changes into occupations I thought I would enjoy, only to find out they were absolutely nothing like I thought they would be and didn't fit me at all.  Current job, for instance.

But I will look into the book and course.  Thank you."

Edit:  Not a criticism.  They just don’t get food if we aren’t there.  I fill my cat’s bowl with food before I go to work so he has something to eat, and he usually just hoovers it immediately.  Silly boy."

Isn't it beautiful?  More beautiful to me than any religion's promise could ever hope to be, because we can know.  We *know*.

Instead of feeling fearful and insignificant, I am filled with awe to be a part of it all.

I'm glad you're not afraid of oblivion.  There's no such thing, really.  Your atoms were here, they're still here, and they'll be here until the end of matter and time.  They just become a part of something else, that's all.

We are waves of this vast ocean.  We rise and take this form, for a time, you and I, and return to where we began.  Still a part of the ocean.  Always a part of it all.

exchristian,ff7i7cb,t3_erfwrl,1579650137.0,"Tell him that true compassion has no ulterior motive.  Compassion reaches for someone and says, I am human and you are human and we bleed the same color and illusive grasping ego is the only thing that separates us from each other.  My pain is your pain.  I can’t make it go away, but how can I help.

Compassion has nothing to sell and everything to give.  You may mean well, but you are going about it entirely the wrong way by trying to sell me something and using underhanded means to do it.  This is a poor way to relate to a human being, especially one in such a vulnerable position, and while I respect your right to your own beliefs, even your right to try to sell them, I do not want to buy what you are offering, so please respect my right to be left alone.

Sure you look, sound, act a little different than me, but go deeper, down to the stuff that makes us, and see if you can tell us apart.

Thing is, all of the people at that meetup are just as confused and lonely as you.  All of them desperate for the connection, understanding, acceptance, that seems impossible to find.  I feel like these kinds of meetups are, unfortunately, superficial at best.  Everyone’s posturing, worrying about what everyone else thinks, trying too hard.  Just the same way you are.

I’m not a therapist.  But I’m a lonely human too, and I say this:  While you’re searching outwardly for acceptance, for friendship, first you have to accept yourself.  It’s okay to be flawed, to make mistakes, as long as you’re really, sincerely trying.  You’re only human.  And it’s always a work in progress, but if you make an effort to make peace with yourself, you might find it easier to be more open with people, just *be* with them naturally, without any goal in mind, and what you seek might find you instead.

I met my dearest friend in WoW.  We no longer play, but we’re in constant communication through Discord.  It’s reassuring to pull out my phone and just jabber about whatever’s going on in life, good or bad.  I wish he was here, but at least we can support each other."
Buddhism,fdk46v8,t3_elt30t,1578495634.0,"Did you know the smell of freshly cut grass is a distress response?  The injured grass is releasing chemicals to try to defend and repair itself.  Other leafy plants do this too.  Even something as “simple” as a plant can suffer in its own way. 

I definitely cared about other people and plants and animals before I was a Buddhist.  But when I started to work on breaking down the barrier between “self” and “other,” their well-being became all the more important, because in the end it’s my well-being too.  

Anyway, it sounds like you’re becoming more sensitive to the state of the living beings around you.  Let it happen, and express gratitude as you meditate on the preciousness of life, even the lives we must kill in order to survive.  Especially those."
