depression,feoxqny,t1_feox2w0,1579307675.0,"I'm an occultist, and love diving in and studying pretty much any esoteric information I can get my hands on. I consider myself a chaos magician, and through some of the study of that and a (sort of mock) religion called Discordianism, I've learned to laugh at things that might have worried or brought me down in the past as well as not take things too seriously. I have daily practices with rituals, meditations, various magickal work, and will frequently invoke laughter throughout the day. Sometimes I'll just force laughter, which then become real laughter, and by the end of it I can't get a smile off of my face.

You should find the time! I know how it is to feel like you don't have enough time to do things, I'm a family man with a toddler running around. You can't let it stop you though! If it's something that will make you happy then you owe it to yourself to do it! Your happiness will reflect of those around you. :)"

I'm not sure if I'm happier because of my studies and practices or because I found something I'm passionate about and strive for more at. I've always had a fascination with the occult and magick and through that I had to take responsibility for my situations in life and it lead me to find ways of conquering my depression and anxiety."

Gnostic,femxonk,t3_epxz88,1579272298.0,"My views are along the lines of yours OP. 

I personally think that this world is intentionally imperfect, because if things were perfect, we would feel no need to develop and become more. It's through strife and struggle that we develop into better and stronger versions of ourselves. I think it's through the evolution of the soul that we're able to transcend this physical plane."

agnostic,fejjhma,t3_epdglf,1579176865.0,"Etymologically, I suppose you can make that argument, but Gnosticism is a very rich belief system. There are several groups considered ""Gnostic"" and it generally boils down to a belief that the world and/or universe is corrupt and was created by a being call the Demiurge. In classic Gnostic Christianity, the Demiurge is the God of the Old Testament and the God that Jesus refers to is a transcendent and unkowable God. The flesh is essentially a prison and this world hell. Their goal is to recognize their imprisonment and do things in this life so that they can ascend to the Pleroma, the highest spiritual plane where divinity lives, upon death.

TLDR: There's a lot more to Gnosticism than just ""knowing"""

So, based on my understanding, this is a system that uses sigils so that the magician can evoke certain moods conducive to whatever working the magician is doing?"
chaosmagick,fefsy7w,t3_eo9dnl,1579064251.0,"I have several tools on my altar and I don't believe a single one is necessary. To be honest, some of my most successful magick has been done with no tools and in the car while driving. Lol I think that fact that part of my mind is occupied makes a more powerful gnostic state."

chaosmagick,fdk7smc,t1_fdk66a0,1578498034.0,"Nah, all I did was have my base sentence that I formed the sigil out of and when I ""spoke"" the words into the servitor I just spoke the original sentence and visualized the words coming out of my mouth as energy and going into the servitor. For me, magick has been most successful when I don't bog down my spells with too many details. In my opinion, when you can keep the goal as a general idea, it tends to come to you more easily. 

I have done sex magick in the past, but I've not used it for sigil or servitor creation. When I used sex magick I gathered the energy generated by my wife and I and I used that energy to visualize money raining down around me, which I guess could arguably be considered sigil magick depending on your view of a sigil. This magickal working that I described in my previous comment was performed purely through energy work and direction."
chaosmagick,fdk2ru4,t1_fdjz8sq,1578494648.0,"Thank you!

The method I used would fall into the ""I will find a coin"" structure.

I use a 2nd person conception, I think it connects the servitor to me more easily.

The method I used to create it was more intuitive. I originally created the sigil and a mantra for it before I decided to create the servitor. After firing the sigil, I made a ball of energy shaping it into the form of the sigil and ""spoke"" it's program and directed energy into it. I then named the sigil after it's mantra word and visualized an energy link between it and myself, sort of like a leash. I've been sure to refeed it with energy when I've felt it become weaker and check on it every so often throughout the day."

You want to visualize your energy field as kind of a furnace and the emotion as the fuel. Turn your attention to that emotion and visualize and ""feel"" that energy being ""burnt up"" to make your energy field stronger."
LeftHandPath,fdhltzy,t3_ele9dd,1578425384.0,When I worked in a darker paradigm I would convert those negative feelings into pure energy to fuel any magickal work I was doing. That's my two cents.
chaosmagick,fdhl98g,t1_fdhag4f,1578425035.0,"To add to what u/wockyman said, the technique involves using laughter in multiple situations. Laughing when something is positive, neutral, or even bad. In practice, I've found that if I start to feel upset or stressed and make myself laugh, even though it's fake, the laughter eventually becomes real and I end up with a smile on my face not even worried about what bothered me before."

The chaos magick is just as effective as the other magick I've done but it required less work and ritual to get successful results.

chaosmagick,fdelh4c,t1_fdel2li,1578341541.0,"Okay, that's what I figured but wasn't too sure.

I made a sigil and made a mantra for the sigil. I decided that instead of just using it the sigil and mantra when I needed it I would just make it a servitor and referred to it as the mantra word. This was about two hours ago and when I went to just reaffirm it was there and got a flash of this being that resembled what I designed it for. It was a little alarming and I wasn't sure if I was losing my head or if stuff like that happened."

You're pretty spot-on on what you said about magick. I've been a magician for years and have always wondered what people who follow LOA thought in regards to that question. I know I've met a lot of religious people who don't consider prayer to be magick, but I feel that anytime you're putting your intention out into the universe, you're performing magick. When performing a ritual as a magician I'm really just using a ritualized setting and tools to strengthen my will towards that intention."

I didn't say no one says anything bad, I said I haven't heard it. When I say the quality of the work being subjective I'm referring the fact that this is occultism, and the qualities of the rituals and magick really come down to the practitioner. As far as translations and history go, I'm not a linguist nor a historian, so I can't speak on them."
