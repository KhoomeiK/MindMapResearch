TexasRangers,fdrq4s9,t1_fdros5z,1578688071.0,"Yea, Sean Casey gave a pretty entertaining explanation on how it goes down. It‚Äôs all business but it‚Äôs hard for it to not feel personal."
politics,fdpy25v,t1_fdphu72,1578645430.0,"My personal favorite from that clip is them wanting Trump to fill his cabinet with millionaires as opposed to the ‚Äúelites‚Äù that look down on them, not realizing that that‚Äôs exactly who those millionaires are."

LifeProTips,fd6r3vp,t1_fd6p7c6,1578194689.0,"Well it‚Äôs illegal to have hidden cameras in hotels or rental homes. If you want to have cameras, disclose where they are or make them seen. Otherwise it‚Äôs super sketchy."
sports,fcypgtj,t1_fcyp8l3,1578084434.0,"I‚Äôve always felt bad for the lions, seems like your team has the worst luck."
worldnews,fcx9vvl,t1_fcx9aqd,1578056794.0,That last analogy caught me off guard
todayilearned,fcwvx0e,t1_fcwvpb1,1578039853.0,"Hey man, all I‚Äôm saying is that you claimed you didn‚Äôt have time for debates but you took the time to write multiple 500 word comments while being incredibly condescending in the process. You could‚Äôve made some good points if you actually engaged but you tip-toed around the issue and backpedaled. Generally when you say something is a simple fact, you expand on that with additional evidence. That‚Äôs mostly the reason for you getting downvotes, not your original comment.

Edit: After going through the replies to your comment, it seems like everyone is asking for clarification and you‚Äôre the one going on a hostile tirade."
todayilearned,fcwulj2,t1_fcwsrop,1578038265.0,But... you can debate what is and isn‚Äôt fact. You making a statement and providing no explanation or evidence doesn‚Äôt make you right. Your last paragraph is also grade A projection.
mildlyinteresting,fcwp7ua,t1_fcw69nk,1578032366.0,You sound like the biggest pansy.

CFB,fcp7fr1,t1_fcp5f57,1577852983.0,This is a compliment and a roast at the same time.
CFB,fcp356k,t1_fcp32kf,1577849024.0,Yo if they let you bring your boat can I ride along?

wholesomememes,fcjdky5,t3_ehg4cw,1577683917.0,I love how a lot of the posts on this sub are memes might‚Äôve been intended to be making fun of something and we turn it around into something wholesome üëç
TexasRangers,fcix7ig,t3_ehe4fx,1577671976.0,A team would have a pretty hard time scoring a lot of runs if they exclusively played small ball.
CFB,fcaqt1w,t3_egx3ol,1577574762.0,"Broke: Breaking your program‚Äôs single game passing TD record in a full game.

Woke: Breaking it in the first half."
politics,fc2birv,t1_fc2alge,1577350405.0,"No, you are wrong. The house is still valued at $500k in today‚Äôs dollars. But it seems like you know that, you‚Äôre just being pedantic and pretending that you didn‚Äôt know that I was using the word money to mean wealth.

Edit to add: And no, turning $400 million into $3.1 billion is not that impressive, given the time period it was over. That amount of money basically multiplies itself with even very conservative investments."
politics,fc2a1od,t1_fc27wfd,1577347907.0,"His wealth isn‚Äôt in cash, it‚Äôs tied up in assets. If I buy a house that‚Äôs worth $500k and over 10 years it gains no value but how much it‚Äôs worth goes up to $600k, I didn‚Äôt actually make any money. If you were to make $1000 last year and the inflation rate is 10% and you make $1100 this year, you didn‚Äôt actually make any more money than you made last year. This is very basic economics stuff."
sports,fbzzczm,t1_fbzxhav,1577270095.0,"And where did you go to med school, moron?"
wholesomememes,fbzo0in,t1_fbzmcmk,1577253458.0,Right? Everyone was almost getting mad at me because I couldn‚Äôt think of anything I‚Äôd want. The only gift I really needed was a break from college and to see my family and friends.
