Wellthatsucks,ffn2t0f,t1_ffmoeqe,1580061405.0,Can he check a salvage yard for a window?
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffn0lbl,t1_fflzovk,1580060734.0,"Geez! What a way to go. Should've researched something like that I guess, as bad as it sounds to say..."
blackladies,ffk5ica,t1_ffjukez,1580016528.0,"I appreciate the input!

I'm curious as to why these things still persist. Blacks seem to be one of the most divided races... granted, some of that was institutionalized (house slaves, the perception of ""good hair,"" etc). But whereas there are instances of, say, Koreans being discriminatory toward Vietnamese in their country, blacks in America take it another step further. We have the whole color thing (seen light and dark skin sisters scowling at one another way more often that I like), and now I've just realized this African and African American thing.

How the heck do we unite everyone? It's enough that the media slaps us around, I hate to see us doing it to one another on top of that...

It would make me so happy to see black women of all shades and backgrounds uplifting one another and becoming one of the strongest classes in America. Institutionalized racism is determined not to see it happen... and it goes deep and in all directions."
blackladies,ffk4ra8,t1_ffk2nf3,1580015823.0,"I'm not disagreeing with you at all, but media commonly paints african american culture as being rife with violence, drugs, ""ghetto-ness,"" and ebonics/slang. I get called white if I act too ""proper"" for my tone, for instance, when I should just be called a nerd or something. I live in a very white area where I sometimes get criticized for not fitting the stereotype. I even had a foreign friend who I consider to be very traveled and educated hit me up cause he encountered a gay black man and he was flabbergasted. ""I did not know black culture allowed for gays!"" I was like well... we are people, lmao.

The more positive sides of the black community havent been publicized, sadly. I had white acquaintences who didn't want to see Marvel's Black Panther because their other white friends told them it was just crapping on white for slavery. I convinced them to see the movie and they were surprised. Sigh.

I'm rambling. Anyway, I agree with you! I'm just afraid that most people only see the negatives of the black community."
blackladies,ffjrftc,t3_etzn0y,1580004975.0,"It's happened few enough times to me that I can't recall a specific occurrence. Does it seem to be an accident when it happens? Does it happen with the same women over and over?

I'm thinking there's a chance people are doing this without realizing it, maybe just a ""hey, watch out!"" loud enough that they know you're talking to them will discourage it.

I think it's really easy to become hyper aware once something negative or strange happens enough times. I hate having my mind go, ""was that racist?"" everytime something off occurs due to past experiences and things that have been described to me by others. Half the time, the things are benign enough, I'm sure... do you think that sounds similar to what you're experiencing with the hair thing?"

Pets,ffihvh1,t1_ffihig4,1579974245.0,"I agree with the above. You're just looking for a reason to break up with your girlfriend. At this rate, you'll be over her before you break the news, which isn't fair IMO. Just get on with it and stop stringing the girl along, she deserves better. Sounds like you already cheated on her, too."
Pets,ffhinjf,t3_etckam,1579936969.0,"Just wanted to mention that you can call an officer (you can use the non emergency line, too) and the situation can be documented and handled that way. Even if you weren't after damages... consider that someone that irresponsible is walking around with two potentially dangerous dogs. What if it's a kid, a small dog, or a cat next time? 

Regardless, I hope Goose is feeling better!"
blackladies,ffhe0vh,t3_etgdjo,1579931431.0,"I'm sorry to hear you have to deal with what is only too common for many of us. It can wear on you to feel isolated and be confronted with other peoples' ignorance. Stay strong, sis. I wish I had something to tell you to make you more optimistic, but know that we are here for you!"
blackladies,ffhdjd6,t1_ffbahl9,1579930906.0,"Oof, I feel ya. You can't hardly look left or right without society whispering that most men would rather go for a bottom of the barrel white chick than a well put together black woman. I hate how some people react as if we're an enigma or something. It's alienating and bizarre.

Where I am, I'm expected to be the token black chick that shows everyone blacks really are friendly and ""just like everyone else"". I've been told this in so many words multiple times. It's hard to stay strong when every other woman gets to just coast by, and we are expected to prove ourselves at every turn.

We must battle against becoming jaded. Remembering our beauty and capability is a must. I hope to see more black women uplifting other black women in the near future."

politics,ff8cbu0,t1_ff84faf,1579672723.0,"The closed mindedness is real. Currently in ND, and the change in how people think in the more rural areas is surreal.

I've been vegan before, I have friends who are farmers, I know both sides of the arguments. But you know what isn't changing the world? Arguing with you on a sub dedicated to enjoying happy cows.

I'll say it again - and mean it - have a great day."

offmychest,ff3h94w,t1_ff30s7d,1579540989.0,"IMO if the remarks make you feel bad and they aren't willing to stop, it's nothing on your part and you need to do what's right or comfortable for you. What if you told him his dick was small and to calm down cause he needs to toughen up? I bet he wouldn't like it.

The fact you wrote this question out here for a public opinion shows you know what the true answer is. There's a reason you keep questioning this.

Life is short. Too short to spend making excuses for someone else's bad behavior."

PubTips,ff2j35l,t3_er3gjk,1579508394.0,"I'm feeling a lot of cliches here. The whole chosen one (multi magic) and magic school/child alone tropes are pretty prevalent here. Weather magic sounds cool, but there's nothing here to really interest me in it besides it being listed that it's a thing.

news,fezqdva,t1_fey4dir,1579460333.0,"I think what the other poster is trying to say is that the very idea of keeping koalas as pets in any capacity cannot lead to a better idea. For one, it's a slippery slope. Let's say the government allows people to keep pet koalas. What about people who want to save pandas by keeping them as pets, too? Or snow leopards? Why do koalas get special treatment?

Another is that they'd make terrible pets. They are domesticated, they are likely not cuddly, and they are WILD. People could get hurt. Another thing is how can you be sure owners are properly caring for them? How long before some asswipe starts a koala puppy-mill type deal? Where are we going to grow and sell all this fresh eucalyptus? 

It's just not feasible, although your heart is in the right place. Look to other well known exotics and see how controversial that already is. Koalas as pets would add fuel to the proverbial flame."
