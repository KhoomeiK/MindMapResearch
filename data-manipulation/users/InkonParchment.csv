UofT,ffb7mnm,t1_ffazw71,1579754093.0,"This applies to me too well, which is why I can’t complain even if I hate post. My high school tried super hard to avoid mark inflation and I have not yet seen anyone get into the cs stream with my average (92 anyone? I came from BC if that matters). So I guess I’m actually one of the people who benefited the most from post."
UofT,ff80r72,t1_ff7vi7c,1579662989.0,lol but have you seen the white guys who wear freaking shorts and defy all the laws of physics by not getting frostbite? Then they put on a short puffy jacket and call that their winter outfit.
UofT,feyyc1h,t1_fetseze,1579451971.0,Somehow they seem to have even more snow at Vancouver rn.
UofT,fepe4nb,t1_fen5l8x,1579318258.0,"Careful with buying spots. They over-enrolled the classes (205 ppl) so if the class capacity says 195, 10 people need to drop before there’s a spot available."
UBC,felg4jp,t1_fekncg7,1579221375.0,"Someone skipped leg day,"
UofT,felg1qf,t3_epom8p,1579221323.0,Do I have a bad sense of smell? Because I have not yet encountered the infamous cs stench. Does anyone know where I could go to experience this cultural phenomenon?
UofT,feg5umi,t1_fefqt33,1579078343.0,I thought that it would be a fixed number of people since their reasoning for having such a competitive post is not enough resources to accommodate all applicants (at least that’s what they tell us lol).
UofT,feg5fu8,t3_eosgy9,1579077780.0,"Oh wow so it wasn’t a glitch! I take back everything I ever said about the cs department. 

Wait did anyone else get into a section other than the new one or is that not supposed to happen?"

facepalm,fdkticp,t1_fdkqtys,1578510831.0,Idk some guys seem super proud that they can use urinals so there’s never a line at the men’s washroom.
UofT,fdipgna,t1_fdiozeg,1578448104.0,Can’t be more time consuming than entering post a year later aye? I would buy a spot but I’m just utterly confused by the entire procedure. Hope I can make up for it with enough dedication.
UofT,fdios4q,t1_fdiohlt,1578447669.0,"Oh damn sorry I’m getting clunky after a few hours of math. 
Hmm I wonder if I could take a day out after waitlists drop to constantly refresh acorn."
UofT,fdiof36,t1_fdfm7lf,1578447434.0,Wait so the spot doesn’t automatically go to the first on the waitlist?
UofT,fdfq3vv,t1_fdewlcx,1578367508.0,Does this apply to utsg or just utm?
UofT,fdeoyzq,t1_fdcnq49,1578343598.0,Do we fill this out at the registar? Or do we find it online?
wholesomememes,fd6aj6b,t1_fd4fbyz,1578188025.0,"You will not believe how many kids have stapled their hand, or hit their thumb with a hammer instead of the nail. They also tend to stab themselves with scissors and step on push pins. I don’t consider these injuries particularly “safe”, and those tools are more than enough to cause them without supervision."
wholesomememes,fd48x1l,t3_ejxkef,1578165411.0,Err I can completely imagine the kid gawking their hand off with one of those tools especially since the parent isn’t even teaching her how to use it. In which case it would both begin and end badly.
UofT,fci8fjy,t1_fci89up,1577658998.0,lol then they should redesign all the courses that fail 80% of the students
UofT,fci87jv,t1_fci5chk,1577658914.0,I didn’t fail man. Just didn’t get an 85.
Showerthoughts,fci82tl,t1_fci5808,1577658864.0,There was a new teacher a my high school who’d just finished teaching at a university. All his students hated him when he pulled the “I’m not doing _x_. Your professors won’t do _x_ in university”. Kids made his life hell after that.
UofT,fci3mwc,t1_fchlf4k,1577657375.0,"AP classes are and should be based on the exam. Whatever your high school had was great but shouldn’t be expected of other high schools. I had an AP Chemistry class that spun off into the oblivion and taught difficult but completely irrelevant stuff to the class. I ended up self studying the entire course, and most of the class was dumbstruck when they saw a completely alien exam. There’s a reason it’s called an AP class, AP does not stand for “difficult”. 

On the other hand I do agree that high schools should have an advanced class that teaches logic and proofs. I wish there was a class like that so I’d be better prepared for uoft. But AP Calc BC is designed as a much easier class for many students who will never need to write a line of proof in their life. Let the kids learn what they signed up for."
