datingoverthirty,ff98gzn,t1_ff915zv,1579707270.0,In 36 years I've never met anyone even remotely interesting 'along the way'.  Dating is effort for some of us.  A lot of effort.
datingoverthirty,ff98bvh,t3_es33ov,1579707179.0,"Yup.  The only single women I can find tend to have a disturbing pattern of a long history of crazily abusive exes.  And that doesn't make them a 'bad' one, per se, but it does indicate to me that their decision making abilities are poor, at best."
datingoverthirty,ff97oj0,t3_erusg7,1579706761.0,"I went on the first date of my life at 34 (about 2 years ago now), and dating has been an unmitigated nightmare.  I suspect my lack of experience has been the cause for a lot of rejection, though it always comes across as 'no chemistry'.  So, still nothing within spitting distance of a relationship at 36.  

Honestly, I don't think I missed anything not dating in my 20s.  I've seen enough stupid relationship behavior in my 30s to think that relationships in my 20s would have been a real goddammed shitshow.  

I think the only advice I'd have given my past self that 'You'll survive rejection."""

My response is that he attracts two types of women -  above 50, and below 15.

The closest he's come is one day I was walking him in the park, and a nice looking lady my age comes walking in my direction.  She looks down at him, and gets a big smile.  As we get closer she looks at me and says 'So handsome!'

Sensing my obvious confusion, she lifted a hand and helpfully clarified 'Oh, not you!'"

If I had gotten canceled on twice day of, I'd assume you're not interested and walk away too.  If you are interested, you need to show him you are.  

And granted, work got in the way and it is flu season. It's not your fault.  But you're going to have to take the next step at this point.

Bonus points:  Try and meet up on a 'high quality' date night, like friday or saturday (or whatever your weekend days are, if you have those in your medical job).  That would communicate interest to me. Though, for example, if someone canceled two first dates and suggested a Monday night date, that to me would communicate profound disinterest."
