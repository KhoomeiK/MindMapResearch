Modern engines aren't often V8's anymore.

Cars gets worse mileage today in part because they are larger and heavier. Go park a new F150 next to an example from the late 80's, and the difference is astounding. Go park a new Mirage (which people whinge about being so ""small"") next to a Corolla from 20 years ago. The Mirage subcompact is larger than a so called midsize car from the 90's. 

Not only are they bigger, they are heavier due to increased safety standards - which is good. Any car made after 2015 needs to be able to support four times it's own weight on the roof, for example. Then there are the airbags. There's usually more than two of them, and all of that weighs something. Newer cars are strong enough [that the tools firefighters use to cut open wrecked cars aren't strong enough.](https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/firefighters-search-for-ways-to-save-victims-in-new-jaws-of-life-resilient-cars) All of that makes the car heavier, which makes it get worse mileage.

news,ffvhbqi,t1_ffvbzmj,1580264116.0,">Hire. A. Lawyer. And don't wait ten years to do it. 

When I first got divorced, and child support was set up, I couldn't afford a lawyer. For ten years, I couldn't afford a lawyer, because, get this, I had to support myself while paying a few hundred bucks a month while making $8-$12 per hour. 

I drove a 20+ year old vehicle, I didn't go out and drink, I had an ancient PS1 hooked up to a 26"" tube TV that my parents gave me. I didn't have a cell phone of any kind until 2007. Many times I had to forgo meals so my son could eat. Many times, I had to forgo replacing my clothes or shoes, because my son needed clothes, and somehow his mom couldn't afford to buy any for him. And I kept getting dragged into court, because all she had to do was *claim* I was behind, and I'd have to provide proof that I was still employed, and the state was still taking money from my paychecks. 

That eventually changed. I entered a field where I was being paid considerably more.  I got summoned for ""non payment"" again, but this time I had an attorney. It was a big help, and I didn't hear anything more about ""non payment"" for about ten more years. Then she gets a hair up her butt, tries more legal nonsense, and ends up angering a family court judge who basically told her no modifications for two years. Child was over 16 at the time. 

Now, at this late date, the child support is all paid. I missed one payment in all that time when I lost a job, but I got it paid back within three months. But during the first few years, I was having to take days off I couldn't afford, to go to court and prove that I was current on child support. Some people cannot *afford* to give the system a try."
