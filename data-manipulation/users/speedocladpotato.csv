todayilearned,ffis201,t1_ffik39m,1579981285.0,"Thanks for the civil discussion. We all stand to gain when views are exchanged on a level-headed playing field.

The problem with your views on the subject is delegation. Who are we going to delegate authority to, for a decision on whose life is less meaningful?

If Christians decide that abortion is murder, should they be allowed to decide that Atheist pro-choice supporters lives don't matter?

Non-vegetarians have killed more animals throughout history than Nazis ever have. Should vegans be allowed to decide the value or meaning of our lives?

Crimes of passion have surely killed more people throughout history than the Nazis. Since that involves taking of life, how are we going to quantify how much these people's lives mattered? 

If bloodletting is the sole quantification to decide that a certain section of society matters less than others, EVERY SINGLE LEADER OF STATE HAS BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS- directly and indirectly- how valuable are those people? Do their lives matter less?

I have been mugged thrice- once in Burundi(knife point), once in Sanaa, Yemen(business end of two AK47s), and the third in Goa, India( knife when i was with my 13 year old nephew). All three times were by black men in their 20s-30s. Am i to shoot black men on sight because now i believe that their life matters less than mine?

Don't mistake my stance on the subject as sympathy for the Nazis- it's not. I'm Indian( the nazis would've gassed me right to toast), and what most people would consider right leaning. I support the death penalty. I also am terrifically sympathetic with what happened to the jews at the hands of the Nazis.

My opinion is- all lives matter. And you're just as violent as a Nazi if you march in public or declare on a public platform that Nazi life doesn't matter. You aren't any different from the Nazis who believed Jewish lives don't matter, or the KKK who believed that black lives matter less than white lives.

All lives matter. Leave it to the law of the land to decide if one particular part of society matters less than the rest.

You have a good day, big man. Let me know what you think."

I was quoting statistics, to be honest. More murders are committed by black folk than nazis these days, and that was my singular point of focus for the argument.

I am nod denying the horror that your family went through,and i am deeply sympathetic towards that experience. But your statement is still wrong. All lives matter. Nazi, brown, black, yellow, white. Due process of law is the only thing that devalues a life and has the authority to terminate it.

todayilearned,ffhut5i,t1_ffhrtbg,1579954923.0,"We sympathize with your family. But the reasoning still stands. All lives matter.

WatchRedditDie,ferh2on,t1_feprtxn,1579353766.0,"The law of any land is the only constant, when it comes to taking life. The law may be harsh, illogical, mean-spirited, incredibly dangerous- or as is the case with Nazi Germany- have tragic consequences. But societt collapses without the bulwark of established law to support it.

If one does not lay down a basline as to who we need to obey, and whose standards apply- it is open season: i get to kill you for a perceived insult. You get to shoot my dog because it's cross-eyed, and someone else is permitted the right to chop off my genitals because i currently sleep with a wife he divorced ten years ago, and still has the hots for. And all three of us walk away scott-free because we were allowed to take justice into our own hands.

To return to my original argument- all lives matter- it is not up to the layman to decide that your life matters less than someone else's life.

Reddittors the world around clutch at each others' penises gleefully, in a blissfully orchestrated circle jerk every time this picture is posted( where black musician Tom Morello is playing against a backdrop that says Nazi lives don't matter). Tom Morello is wrong, bigoted and is inciting violence.

Imagine a KKK rally in the current climate flying a banner that stated black lives don't matter. Every tom, dick and harry would wet his panties in outrage. 

All lives matter, bar none. It is the law that gets to decide. No one else. And as soon as we drop that standard, we permit anarchy. I am not qualified to provide an opinion on whether that is a good or bad thing.
