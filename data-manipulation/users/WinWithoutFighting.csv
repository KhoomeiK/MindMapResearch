To me it seems, if anything, someone has clearly taken the time and energy to demonstrate to him what kindness is. Maybe that was mom, maybe a teacher, who knows.

WritingPrompts,ff2ly7x,t3_er9js8,1579512461.0,"""Thank you for calling Comcast, have a blessed day"" and I disconnect the call.

Fairly satisfied with myself for having pissed off another customer, a customer who lives in an area where Comcast has zero competition, I lean back in my chair and bask for a moment in the warm feeling I get from genuinely having a modicum of power over a stranger.

I'm logging the details of this call and about to hop back in the queue to take my next one, when I hear a ""clunk"" sound behind me. Someone dropped something on the floor. This is a giant call center, I'm used to blocking out distracting sounds, I didn't think too much of it, until I hear Sarah scream.

Sarah is my desk-mate. We share one giant cubicle with her in one corner and me opposite. I wheel around while answering my next call to see what was wrong. ""Thank you for calling Comcast, can I have your ... ""

My sentence broke off when I see a young woman, no more than 30, hurriedly pick up something from the floor. I have worked here for 2 years, and I did not recognize her.

Sarah is just pointing and covering her mouth while emitting a high-squeal noise. I wanted to cancel Sarah's service right there.

Somehow, none of this really concerned me in the least. Until I saw she was picking up a revolver. My caller was talking in my ear, and I knew for a fact she had already been on hold for 27 minutes, but I disconnected it anyway. Took off my headset. I was about to watch some real shit go down. Or so I thought.

Gun Girl was wearing jeans. I think I only remember that because I thought to myself ""this is a business casual environment and you are underdressed.""

So I am basically sitting there with my popcorn ready to watch a show, right? I was honestly excited. This doesn't happen here. I should enjoy it. I'm off the phone for a legitimate safety concern, so I won't be docked for it. And still on the clock!

But Gun Girl, she flips open the chamber of the revolver, inspects, spins it and snaps it shut. The muzzle was pointed toward the ground, like someone who respects firearms would do anyway. She looks at Sarah and just says ""get out.""

I stood up to leave too, but Gun Girl said ""you sit right back down"" while leveling the loaded 6-shooter at my nose.

I still wasn't scared, honestly. A loaded gun pointed at my face. I still thought this was some huge misunderstanding or a prank or ... anything but really threatening. I think my Comcast power of elitism was still coursing through me, maybe.

I raise my hands and say ""you got me"" and I laugh. Still not realizing the gravity of the situation I was in.

Gun Girl laughed too. I heard police sirens and could see flashing red and blue lights coming from the parking lot.

She obviously saw it too, kind of smirked, then slowly paced toward me, gun still leveled at my fucking face.

Honestly, this was starting to piss me off. Gun Girl had messed up my call volume, my consistency, was really throwing a wrench into my day.

I say ""Okay sweetheart. I don't know you, but if this is how you feel, I'll buy you a drink after work."" I mean I was kind of impressed with her, so far.

Her face changed. I don't mean her expression changed, it was like her facial features rearranged a bit. Her cheekbones grew more pronounced. Her lips turned to little white lines. The hoods of her eyes narrowed. She went from a pretty-ish 30-something, to a freakish, malnourished angry old woman.

She was almost on me, maybe a foot away. The gun still leveled right at my face.

""I know what you are"" she whisper-yelled in that deep, gravelly voice that fucking Disney villains use.

I was still more confused than scared. But I did at least have the sense to realize that she was after me. Only Me. No one else in the world seemed to matter to her. There were at least a hundred of my coworkers streaming out of all exits. She could have easily shot lots of them.

My hands were still up in a comical surrender, I guess I kind of froze, or maybe something told me to keep them in her sight. I didn't move much, just waited for the next thing to happen.

Within about 4 minutes of Sarah's first scream, all of my coworkers seemed to have made it outside. I didn't dare look away from Gun Girl for long, but it is pretty easy to tell when a huge floor of a hundred people suddenly stops making noise.

I'm really not sure what came over me, my heart is starting to beat in my ears at this point, but I said ""may I have your account number?""

She smiled. I felt a little sad for her. She started reciting her account number when I interrupted and said ""I have to type it to pull up your details, is that okay?""

Her smile disappeared and she was a ghoul again. ""Keep your hands on the keyboard.""

I spun around, went to work. In my head I'm thinking this is just an upset customer, I know how to handle this, blah blah. Then I felt the cool steel of the barrel on the nape of my neck. Any pressure on that trigger and the insides of my throat will be splattered all over my workstation.

My relative ease and generally patronizing manner started to crumble. I was not in charge of this situation.

My hands shook a little as I entered the account number. I sighed audibly, and said, in a much less confident voice ""your account has been terminated for non-payment.""

""I would like you to reinstate it, please Mark.""

My name is not Mark. There is another white guy, similar build and hairline to me, named Mark. He works the night-shift. Mark was not here. I was.

""Ma'am, my name is not Mark.""

""Shut up and do it.""

I'm looking at the account details. I have never spoken to this woman on the phone. But I know her name. Or at least, I know the name of the account holder whose number she gave. ""Ma'am, may I call you Mrs. Waterston?""

""No. You can call me Ms. Waterston. Not missus. Because my husband is dead. And you know why.""

I can still feel the gun on my neck. She is not pressing so much, just holding it there. She leans over my shoulder a bit to try to read what is on my screen. I heard a loud pop, but from far away, and apparently a can of red spray paint had just exploded, because me and my cubicle were covered in a fine mist of pinkish red.

I feel the gun fall from my neck. She slumped down on my shoulder for a second, then carelessly rolled off of me and settled on the floor.

She had a small red hole in her right temple, just next to her eye. The back of her head was gone. Just ... just gone man. If you picked up a watermelon and threw it at the ground, maybe some of the rind would still look ripe and pretty, but the side that hit the ground would be all smashed to shit. 

I instinctively put my hands back up in the air, my ""please don't shoot me"" gesture, apparently. I could hear a cop or someone talking to me through a bull horn from outside the building.

I was too scared to move. So I shouted. ""HEY ITS (my name). DON'T SHOOT. SHE IS DEAD."" I stood slowly, careful to keep my hands high above my head as I peeked over my cubicle wall.

They asked me to walk out with my hands up. I wanted to comply, but my legs were just jelly. My knees were overcooked noodles. I yelled again ""COME IN. SHE IS DEAD.""

And she was clearly dead. I had about 60 seconds to sit there, looking at her, before they stormed in. Her eyes were open. Her mouth was open as if she had something else to tell me. I didn't want to move much. My hands were still in the air.

The rest of that day is a messy blur. They made me go to the hospital in an ambulance, even though it was not my blood and brain matter that was all over my face and clothes. At some point I had answered enough questions, a nice detective name Jim drove me back to the call center where my car was parked. On the way, he asked me if I knew why Gun Girl had thought I was someone else.

I said ""Jim, I work for Comcast. If people don't want to kill me, I am probably not doing a very good job."""

pics,ff09zi0,t1_ff00uyl,1579466766.0,"This is what I immediately thought too after reading that comment. I've loved Jim ever since Ace Ventura. Hell I even remember him on MadTV. I was really surprised to see him so vulnerable and sort of ... lost? ... grasping for understanding? ... I'm not sure how to describe the feeling I got from that interview with Seinfeld. He seems like someone who has spent so much of his life being an intentionally outrageous caricature, he never stopped to figure out who he really was, what he really thought about the world. It is sad, but at the same time, I view it as a sort of sacrifice to his art form.

I'm rambling and I'm not a psychologist. I just loved this guy so much when I was a kid (I think I was 12 when Ace Ventura came out), but I think about that CICGC episode everytime see his name now. He seems like a genuinely sweet and compassionate person who has been trying to find some truth in this world (like all of us).

I just hope he has experienced some of the joy and laughter (and tears: Eternal Sunshine) he brought to me and I'm sure millions of others.

Edit: ""LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING""
He was on In Living Color. Not MadTV. My bad everyone."
