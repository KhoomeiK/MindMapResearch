Brogress,fgm4g3c,t3_ez5fr1,1580917810.0,Always love the comments here.  Basically just a sub where people come to shit on OP to make themselves feel better.
CozyPlaces,fglvzqh,t1_fgkbt5r,1580912271.0,This is how I feel about like half of the more popular posts on many reddit design subs.  Some people just throw a million plants into a room completely overcrowding it and everyone loses their minds over it.  If I mention that I like the room but maybe could do with a bit fewer plants it's to the bottom we go!
homegym,fgk2o0n,t1_fgje48n,1580856227.0,Yep.  I rearranged my gym once without thinking about this and then had to put everything right back where I had it before after laying down on the bench and getting blinded by the overhead lights.
cringepics,fgj94fo,t1_fgib6dc,1580839426.0,Yea I'm totally lost on what that person is saying.
OWConsole,fggbrw2,t1_fgg8clh,1580758521.0,"True story.

Playing Rialto yesterday and our Ashe sent me a message telling me I was trash and I couldn't heal.  I had 28k healing in a 15 minute game."
wheredidthesodago,fgg9w6y,t1_fgdsheb,1580757380.0,"My dog won't fetch anything.  Or play tug of war.  The only way he likes to play is for me to chase him, which is exhausting AF.  If tried to explain to him he'd get a lot more playtime if he'd fetch a ball but it's almost like he doesn't understand English."
cringepics,fgg7igb,t1_fgfic64,1580755922.0,If you don't have those moments in your past it's probably because you haven't matured much and are still oblivious to your cringey ways.
RoomPorn,fgfm6nb,t1_fgflu98,1580742422.0,"Nah, in bars and restaurants they put the TV in an area where a lot of people can easily see it from their seats.  In this photo all of the seats are at an extreme angle to the TV or facing away from it.  Nice space, but poorly laid out for functionality."
RoomPorn,fgfll20,t1_fgfl8yq,1580741995.0,"Ok, but why even put the TV there and then have nowhere to actually sit and watch it?"
RoomPorn,fgfl1be,t1_fgfkusi,1580741595.0,Do you have a source for that?
RoomPorn,fgfjv4v,t3_ey5xd5,1580740720.0,"3 sitting areas in one photo, and all of them are terrible for watching the TV that's mounted too high."

Saints,fg06of0,t1_fg04ulz,1580401389.0,Yea I'll be honest if this shit is true I won't watch another game until everyone who played a role is no longer a part of the team.  This is disgusting to read about.
RoomPorn,fg05g16,t3_ew5xn7,1580400623.0,I feel like everything in this room would light up like a glowstick under a black light.

MurderedByWords,ffwpugr,t1_ffwefiq,1580308073.0,I googled his name and got a bunch of underwear model dudes.
facepalm,ffue0di,t3_ev5uzj,1580239978.0,He should be more embarrassed by the fact that he made a “stink” about it in the first place than not realizing he was at fault for making the typo.  Confronting someone for such a minor mistake is so petty.
Astros,ffu4rcp,t3_eutnub,1580234470.0,"She's cute.  Kinda trippin me out how her head looks so off center in that pic, though."

pussypassdenied,ffrevh2,t1_ffrdf8d,1580156673.0,I believe bombs made by Raytheon were used in airstrikes in Yemen that killed a bunch of civilians.
houston,ffn612b,t1_ffn0ljp,1580062406.0,"It’s not a popularity contest, it’s just about not being a dick to everyone else on the road like it’s your world and we’re all just living in it.  

It’s also not about “guarding your highway turf”, it’s about not falling further back in traffic because some asshole thought he was clever by going all the way up to the front and trying to squeeze in.  Imagine lacking so much self awareness that you think you’re in the right trying to cut in line with no regard to anyone else around you."
houston,ffmqvxc,t1_ffmokz8,1580057976.0,Stop trying to justify your selfish driving habits.  Everyone else on the road hates you.
RoomPorn,ffiz22c,t1_ffiyhp3,1579986247.0,I’d prefer to just have windows and those not be a part of life.  But I’d still definitely take a bath in there.
Saints,ffg3brz,t3_ete1hs,1579897555.0,This is one of the best PR statements I’ve seen a team make in the wake of some controversy.  Now let’s hope it’s all true.
technicallythetruth,fffew8a,t3_et9jz0,1579882456.0,"Between this not fitting the sub, and calling it ""stone paper scissors"" in the title, this is my least favorite post so far in 2020."
Saints,fffcmvo,t3_etbojn,1579881020.0,Between this and the Astros cheating scandal I'm pretty close to just saying fuck sports.
facepalm,ffd1rsx,t3_esslhd,1579811715.0,"Psssh oh sure I totally believe the rest of you change your clothes *every day* like a bunch of psychos.

What's next?  You're going to tell me most people shower every day as well?  Yea, not fallin' for it."
facepalm,ffcolw3,t1_ffaddlj,1579803900.0,"Lol, well I just meant canceled for local events everyone was attending, not specifically for deer hunting season.  Ours were for Mardi Gras and the Saints' Superbowl victory parade.  Also they canceled class one day when it snowed enough to stick on the ground simply because that never happens in Nola."
homegym,ffcndep,t1_ff7hx8v,1579803136.0,"If you're not dropping any weight I would guess that should be fine, but you may want to be extra safe and look up what the building codes and regulations were at the time the place was built.  Nowadays I believe bedrooms in the US must be rated to hold 30 lbs/sq. ft., and common areas to 40 lbs./sq. ft.  What you've said you'd want to put in there probably wouldn't be too much different in weight from just having a couple of friends hanging out in a typical furnished bedroom, which no one would be concerned about given the building is in good shape, so it's really all about how you handle the weight in there."
homegym,ffclmlf,t1_ffba2uf,1579802073.0,"I have the 1/2"" smaller mats and they've protected my floor really well and there's no issues with the smaller size.  Actually makes them far easier to carry and move when cleaning underneath.  

I will say that I deadlift in a different space and really do not drop weights in my gym so I can't totally speak to how they perform vs. the 3/4"" for things like that."
facepalm,ffa1muq,t3_esdwta,1579726073.0,The amount of people ITT saying it's not a facepalm to assume the first Monday of deer season is a national holiday is too high
facepalm,ffa0kve,t1_ff9ih81,1579725454.0,To be fair my university canceled classes for similar reasons.  No one was gonna show and it would only stand to hurt the school's reputation and funding if everyone got poorer grades because of it.
nonononoyes,fevis7y,t3_eqjlu1,1579397900.0,I had something similar happen when on safari.  I was sitting in the truck but my leg was dangling out the side.  I thought the entire pride was ahead of us until I felt something brush against my foot and it was a lioness smelling my shoe.  About dookied right then and there but somehow didn’t.  Our guide said the lions just see us in the truck as one big harmless structure that smells like gasoline so they don’t have any interest in the people inside.  Still not sure if he just said that to comfort us but either way it didn’t really help my nerves in that moment.

NewOrleans,fekqi1k,t1_fekmabf,1579205513.0,I personally am not that excited about the lineup but that never seems to matter for me with Jazzfest.  It's the one festival I've been to that's awesome even if I don't care about the headliners and lineup as a whole.
Saints,fekpb2k,t3_epoar3,1579204798.0,Do not want.
theydidthemath,fekeslz,t3_ep5rbp,1579198540.0,"I hate these kinds of “makes you think” comments,  They’re so inaccurate and disingenuous.  Dude completely mischaracterizes how wealth grows.  He pretends as if it grows linearly and doesn’t take into consideration interest, inflation, or the overall time value of money.  Idk if it’s out of ignorance or a desire to make his narrative seem more legit, but if you did what he was talking about you’d be by far the wealthiest person in the history of the world today."

OldSchoolCool,fegs9fz,t3_ep0hiy,1579101352.0,"Your uncles were either held back a lot or they're the oldest looking school-aged people I've ever seen.  I guess they could be teachers, but they look too excited about a school dance to be teachers."
Saints,fegnjwk,t3_eovcyj,1579098058.0,"IMO he should've gotten out a couple of years ago.  That concussion he had where he was sitting on the field crying like he had no idea where he was was tough to watch.  Unbelievable player, seemed like a good dude, but I hated having to play against him."

facepalm,feet6hx,t3_eojl5n,1579040678.0,I love how these types of people always reject some of the most basic scientific facts but have no issue accepting all of the things they use on a daily basis that revolve entirely around applying those same basic scientific facts.  Like how do you think we got to be as advanced as we are if all the scientists and doctors and governments are wrong and lying to us?

Can't really go wrong with any of their offerings.  If you go away from them, try to make sure the bench pad is a proper height of around 17 inches.  A lot of adjustable benches are too tall and make it difficult or impossible for most people to get proper leg drive in a lot of lifts.

I’m just saying if I was in his position and got my pick of the litter I’d probably go for someone just slightly older that’s still a smoke show.  My experience is that a few years go a long way around that age to make the girl more fun to be around.
