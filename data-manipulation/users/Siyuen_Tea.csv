They won't be able to compete with everyday goods.  Mom n pops will  no longer be that.  They will sell activities  such as escape rooms and  VR studios. The  cooks and cashiers of today will be the programmer and robotic repairman of tomorrow.  

Maybe there will be a depression period. I'm sure slavers were pissed when the cotton gin came about. I'm sure horse ranchers were distraught upon the  invention of cars. Coal miners were losing it when we embraced cleaner energies.  Taxi drivers are scared for the future of self driving cars. Every step up in technology removed people from the equation,  yet here we are, largest  population of  all time with relatively low unemployment rates.

There will always be rich people and poor people. There will always be people who no more and are willing to do more to get more. There will always be revolutionaries who come up with new, great ideas and someone following close behind finding a way to abuse it. What defines rich and poor may change but I think we're about a century out from this dystopian era that everyone imagines, leading up to those 100 years will be numerous tweaks along the way,  setting that dystopia back again and again,  as we have done for at least the last couple thousand years."

Once you  can comfortably talk with strangers,  start your red pill journey.  You can start small by simply calling out shit tests. You can play around and tease just for fun. Red pill is really just not letting yourself be walked all over.

technology,fdkqgd6,t1_fdkoo72,1578509014.0,"The major difference between a bookshop and Facebook is what they sell.  In a bookshop, the book is the product,  with social media, you are the product. I'd be willing to meet half-way and say that once a site meets a certain visitor threshold that then they need to give the individual more freedom.  In bookshop terms,  it would be as if you gained a monopoly in a  state and said you're no longer selling books that talk about black history or only selling books that deny the holocaust. When an organisation reaches a certain level of power,  that power needs to be checked. 

Imagine if that holocaust denying bookshop gained enough power, you try to open your own shop saying the holocaust is true but the other place has way more influence than you.  Because you are small and opinion is being denied as sheer insanity people will actively trash your store and make a concerted  effort to  silence you.  

Freedom of speech is a double edged sword, you can't deny it from one and expect it to not be denied from you as well."
technology,fdkis9b,t1_fdkhcnj,1578504643.0,"This isn't feasible because those in power have the ability to silence discontent. Whether simply encouraging doxing or paying people to explicitly hate your site and force people away.  It's similar to how Walmart undercut competitors  because they had the money to do so. Competitors  can't afford to fight.  The cable companies have done the same.  What you're saying would be great in a society that wasn't surrounded by giants.  Admiringly, we naively  dug our own graves.  No one could ever expect the power and influence these sites would achieve. Now it needs to be put in check.  Facebook is a major player,  sure  but I'm including reddit and  Tik tok as well.

With enthusiasm,  it'll take practice.  Initially , you want to try to match there energy, or be slightly above.  Acting energetic tends to make others feel  energetic. If you come in too strong,  too early,  it'll be shocking and annoying.  Too weak, they'll feel as if you're draining them. Gradually raising it as they get comfortable makes them feel like they're having fun. 

It's complicated to explain but the best imagery would be when the quiet kid gets to talk about that one topic they love.  When they come out there shell. That energy burst  can be contagious."

1. A nuke launched in space is very obvious and can be destroyed  pretty early. 

2. To counteract an EMP all you have to do is turn off the power.  People would have a blackout for an hour or 2 and then it's back on.

3. To my knowledge an EMP's effective range is relatively small. 

4. Most large places have a generator for blackouts. Few houses have surge protection.

Read those books,  work on your observation skills.  There's always stuff going on around you. Most importantly, conversations don't have to make sense. Socializing is a hands on skill. No amount of reading will be enough, you need to go out there and talk. The books im recommending  I recommend because they'll help with your confidence. You need to step back and work on that first. Talk with anyone, talk with everyone, then work on flirting and game. If you don't, you'll just collapse under the stress of your own anxiety( which im sure has happened before)."

Ask them about that,  get out of your fucking head and talk. 

2nd. If you need some openers, it dues you no harm to keep 1 or 2 in the pocket. Look up canned openers and read a book like RULES OF THE GAME.  

What you need is social skills in general,  talk with both men and women.  Read books like how to win friends and influence people and make it a natural part of your life. Doesn't matter what you do ,you need to socialize. Either family, friends , customers or coworkers. Develop the skill independent of pussy."
