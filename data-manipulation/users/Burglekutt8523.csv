TheRightCantMeme,ffflmyl,t1_ffflalv,1579886627.0,Nobody said he was at fault for the crimes of those years later. But to assert that Karl Marx wasn't a communist is patently absurd.The man that wrote the communist manifesto was a communist. This should not be a controversial statement. To say he wasn't is like saying that Galileo wasn't a heliocentrist because the idea wasn't wide spread yet.
