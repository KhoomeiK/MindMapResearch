Note that declaring something a crisis doesn’t mean it will get out of hand. In fact, it means you are intensifying efforts to stop it.

This is a bit like the Y2K bug where nothing happened in the end. It wasn’t blown out of proportion - nothing happened because IT people around the globe made sure it didn’t."

Wash your hands regularly, try to avoid touching your face, etc. And obviously don’t cough and sneeze at people or into your own hands, to avoid spreading disease yourself.

Apart from that, the usual trifecta of balanced diet, physical exercise, and good sleep.

There isn’t much else you can do, so there’s no point worrying about it at this point."

Other than that, I enjoy listening to ""The Dark Worlds of H.P. Lovecraft"", read by Wayne June. If you know the video game ""Darkest Dungeon"", he is the narrator voice in that. The downside is that the individual chapters within the volumes aren't labelled by story for some unfathomable reason."

German word order is the same as English (SVO) except in dependent clauses or when an auxiliary verb is used.

“Er stiehlt das Brot.” - He steals the bread.

“Sie sieht, dass er das Brot stiehlt.” - She sees that he steals the bread.

“Er hat das Brot gestohlen.” - He has stolen the bread. Literally *he has the bread stolen*, which has a different meaning in English."

Not to mention that at conferences and summits, the actually important discussions are had aside from the main events. Those are just to get everyone up to speed, dinner is when you can actually get new ideas in."

So it’s not that Cthulhu actually has a cephalopod face and dragon wings, but a faint glimpse (or dream) of him evokes those images in those who sculpted the idol.

So you may well be right and I’m not an expert here at all, but also it really goes both ways: a virus needs to constantly evolve ways to get around its host’s defenses, and the “exploit” these old viruses relied on may well have been “fixed” by now."

Except none of this is even close to the actual definition of either.

As a German expat abroad, I have many things to criticise about my own country, but likening it to fascism or nazism is beyond any reason.

Methinks this is a combination of actual racism he encountered, the proverbial Berlin attitude which he took personal, and a bit of his own melodrama."
