One thing I struggle with is the thought that someone who, like Albert Einstein, would've figured out e=mc^2 must have been born before him. Only to have succumb to malnutrition. 

Where would we be if Einstein wouldn't have had to work on something so simple. 

Now I think that there could be someone alive who can understand particle physics. Someone who could decipher what's happening inside a black hole, but will never be able to because they don't have access to food, or even clean water. 

People in poverty don't have the ability to put their abilities to the test. Because they're too busy just trying to survive. 

I believe that if you give everybody access to food, water, electricity and the internet. The collective human accomplishment would accelerate at an exponential rate. Much like it already has with a quarter of the world having access to the totality of human knowledge."
