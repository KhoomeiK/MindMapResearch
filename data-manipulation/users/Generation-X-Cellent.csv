Ford plans to use the L-engine well into the future for their EcoBoost and Duratec 4-cylinder generations.

interestingasfuck,fge9nrq,t1_fgdwl2d,1580694564.0,I turned off voice navigation 10 years ago because it's fucking annoying. Just look at the damn map every once in awhile and keep your phone in a mount at eye level on your dash.

gaming,fge8doz,t1_fge6uv3,1580693681.0,"I quit World of Tanks and uninstalled the game as soon as they took away the all chat feature. I had almost every tank unlocked, and would often get Top Gun and High Caliber on my tier 8's.

All they had to do is implement a stronger profanity filter or give people the option to turn off all chat so they didn't have to see it.

Fuck them."
techsupport,fge7pmv,t3_exway3,1580693261.0,"If you are using a router supplied by your ISP then it probably has built in Wi-Fi that shares Wi-Fi with other ISP customers in the area. You might have new neighbors that are able to access your router.

I looked up the name of my ISP supplied all-in-one cable modem WI-FI router and logged into it, turned off the firewall, turned off the Wi-Fi, and bridged the whole thing to my personal Wi-Fi router that way the only thing their box is doing is being a cable modem.

Also you don't need more than a few Mb down to play a game. It's your up that would be messing with your character's position. What is your upload speed? My speeds are supposed to be 110/15 but when I run a Speedtest on my system it's usually ~70/5...

Are you sure that you are set up to play in the correct region? When you try to start a multiplayer game it tells you what your ping is when searching for games. What does it say your ping is? It should be under 50. Good is under 30. Best is under 15. 

When you run a internet test within the PlayStation network settings does it say your NAT type is open or NAT2? 

It could also be your ISP. My internet is garbage from about 5 when people come home till about 10 at night when they go to sleep. The more internet connections provided to your neighbors in your neighborhood the worst your connection is going to be.

You can call a tech and have them come out and Bridge their router to your router if it is one of those all in one boxes. What I would do those make an appointment to have them send out a tech to check your signal and make sure it's not too loud or too quiet. While they are there have them turn off the Wi-Fi option and Bridge the router to your Wi-Fi router."
