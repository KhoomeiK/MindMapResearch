CasualConversation,ff32s74,t1_ff311qg,1579532187.0,"They miss the point that most women have the same desires we do. If you try to convince someone into having Sex with you, youre doing something wrong. When I read alot about seduction (about 4 years ago) they saw women as things to have Sex with, not as people you can even be friends with. I think this mindset destroys more than it does for you.

AskReddit,fegc75k,t1_fegaty1,1579087237.0,"The point is that they dont try to change something for the better. They pick a controversial topic and use populistic phrases to get votes. Their goal is not to make the world a better one but to get votes, thus you dont need to discuss their stance on immigration."

They are fashist populists and dont even have a good Policy on immigration other than ""No one gets in"""

AskMen,fdn1u6d,t1_fdgr9te,1578574725.0,"The only people who ever said anything about my height where males and a girl that was into me before. Ive dated a girl taller than me and it never was a problem.

I think height is an easy target and thats why the world seems to revolve around it. 

Its one of the first thigs you notice about something and its not subjective. Saying youre tall is a compliment without an actual compliment because you just state a fact. You dont make yourself vulnerable stating facts.

Of course being tall is an attractive trait for men to have but it is the thing women choose their men after (Most of the time).

For dudes its an easy, unchangeable thing they can self pitty about (been there, altough I am not even that small 5'9). Besides that, would you really want to Date a girl that dates people based on their height??"
ABoringDystopia,fdmmqag,t1_fdmk8zw,1578555891.0,"I agree with you. The argument is that there is no intellectual work involved in creating the piece, which ja clearly false. You dont just come up with a detailed manual to hang a banana without having some message in mind.

I am not an art fanatic or have a big interest in art but this is something I cant stand.

The same argument can be used for every artist. It is possible for every decently talented artist to draw a van gogh like picture. Art is highly contextual but people Look at it as if you can decide the worth of a painting purely by the technichal skill involved in making it."
ABoringDystopia,fdmjpnw,t1_fdmal0f,1578552416.0,Didnt they include a 6 Page manual on how to hang the banana? The banana isnt the piece of art then.
