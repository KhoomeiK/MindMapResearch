If you pick a career which you're suited for, you're more likely to succeed and earn more money / free time as you progress along. You have an inherent advantage over the competition if you have the right aptitudes for your career. You'll be able to accomplish more while working less.

The kicker is you'll actually enjoy your job when you're good at it. It's fun to do things you're good at, so you'll probably end up putting in extra efforts along the way which *really* sets you apart from your peers. And when a job provides you with plenty of money to accomplish your life goals, it's pretty easy to say ""Yeah, I quite like my job""

Basically, play to your strengths."

I had never even considered the fact that it's not about solving 6 sides, but getting 8 corner pieces and 12 edge pieces in the correct positions and orientations to match with the 6 sides pieces which don't move. That part is what I usually explain to people who casually ask ""how do you solve these?""

Eventually I memorized all the necessary steps and enjoyed getting a bit faster. I came up with a few shortcuts along the way. Had an app to time myself that would keep my averages and all that.

AskReddit,fdhkk9a,t1_fdgvzk5,1578424609.0,"So monopoly is interesting to be because of the deal-making aspect. But not for the reasons most people think of.

To be clear, I don't think monopoly is a particularly ""good"" game. It's certainly interesting and you can get some fun outcomes and interactions with people. But as everyone points out, it's too unbalanced. There's not enough catch-up factors, so once you get a lead you just keep extending it until you win. Which of course was the point and it's actually a fantastic analogy for life in many ways.

HOWEVER, regarding the deal-making, it is something I'm quite good at. Versus decent players who understand dice-rolling odds and which properties are most valuable, I can still win a 4-person game around 50-60% of the time. Considering there's a lot of luck in the game and a fair share would be 25%, that's a significant edge.

The interesting thing is that I've NEVER met another player who plays the way I do, and in particular thinks about deal-making in the same way. Most players either:

1. Have no idea how to assess what a good trade is (and will just accept terrible trades
2. Have a decent idea how to assess trades, and always try to ""pull one over"" on the other players

The second option is what I encounter mostly. Everyone thinks this way. It's all about tricking the other players into a bad deal in order to get ahead yourself. I however take an entirely different approach:

* Know how to assess trades, and proactively offer people trades slightly in their favor as soon as possible. I basically try to trade as much as possible.

The reason this works is due to a fundamental aspect of game-theory. I can ""prove"" it with math, but the idea is basically that as you are already aware, the properties go up in value when grouped together. Therefore when you make a trade with an opponent, you are likely going to improve your situation even if it's a better deal for the other person. This might seem strange until you consider the other players in the game. If you are sitting there and two other players make a deal with each other, intuitively you know ""Well that sucks, now they both got monopolies."" And mathematically you're correct, not being involved in trades will hurt you.

Of course it matters what trades you make, and skilled trading requires some foresight. You need to make sure you have a clear plan for how you'll improve your situation down the road before you start offering people trades in their favor. A typical scenario will look something like:

I have an orange, and Player 2 has an orange. I land on the final orange and buy it. Typically in this situations, players in my seat would try to negotiate for the final property. But player 2 will hardball them, knowing how valuable the oranges are. They'll either strike no deal and decide to wait, or give up a LOT of value to get the monopoly. Instead, I would offer to give BOTH oranges in return for a lot of their other properties. Specifically I am looking for properties which have an immediate or likely future chance of being valuable based on what is currently purchased by the other players. For example if Player 3 has a red and green, I might look get a red and green from Player 2 in the trade (with the final property of each being unowned). The odds that either myself or Player 3 will land on one of the final properties is 75%, and in that case I have a guaranteed trade lined up with them.

Now I've acquired maybe 3-4 properties and/or some cash. I don't have a monopoly and I just gave arguably the best monopoly to someone. Everyone thinks I'm stupid. However, inevitably the other players feel forced to trade. I find a trade to give another player a monopoly in return for more value, and again they can't refuse. They're getting a monopoly after all. Finally its just myself and the final player with no monopoly and we clearly agree we must make a trade. I strike up some deal where we both get relatively equal monopolies, but I toss in $100 or something so he's happy to accept. In the end I have extra money from my previous deals, and extra properties that I may end up turning into additional monopolies down the road either by bankrupting someone or just landing on the final unowned one. With extra money and mortgage value I can get my properties up to the critical rent values (usually 3 houses) much quicker and with any decent luck from the dice, quickly extend my lead.

Mathematically it looks something like this:

Say all four players have roughly equal cash/property values. They all have a 25% to win the game. I then trade with Player 2, but give him a better deal, such that he gains 15% winning chances while I only gain 5%. This is because we both improve the ""synergy"" of our properties. The new odds look something like:

Me - 30%

Player 2 - 40%

Player 3 - 15%

Player 4 - 15%

As you can see, Players 3 and 4 get much worse off by not being involved. Then I make a similar trade with Player 3 and the probabilities looks like:

Me - 35%

Player 2 - 30%

Player 3 - 30%

Player 4 - 5%

Finally I trade with player 4:

Me - 40%

Player 2 - 20%

Player 3 - 20%

Player 4 - 20%

In the end I have vastly improved by odds through trading, while each time taking the ""worst end"" of the deals. But because I was involved in every trade, I am never left out and watching other players improve their situations without me. The other players can kind of see what I'm doing, but ultimately are too caught up in the individual trades. Since they believe the idea is to ""get the better deal"", they have a hard time saying no to trades that give them a monopoly while I just get some random properties.

The above percentages are just estimates for the sake of illustration, but as well there are other nuances to the games I take to further improve my odds. Things like making sure I take enough value from players to prevent them from immediately building up their properties. Trying to maneuver such that I get the ""front"" monopoly even if it's technically worse (as in I'll try to get the #1 monopoly on row 2 if I know #2-row2 and #1-row 3 will be taken. Why? Because players will head into my properties with money to pay my rents, while by the time they get to the later ones they may be already close to bankruptcy. I want to be up front so I actually get paid value if they land on me. And even things like timing the execution of trades such that the immediately upcoming turns are such that everyone's tokens are in front of what I'm about to build on, and I've just passed everyone else's stuff. Many times the game is essentially decided within a turn or two of the blockbuster trades I make, so it's vital that the odds are in my favor at that moment."

Because billionaires aren't actual people with incentive structures like everyone else.

If we cut a normal person's salary in half, they'll stop showing up to work. Incentive changes, behavior changes. But with billionaires it doesn't work that way. They're just really lucky or something so they don't deserve all that money. So we can simply tax their income at 99% and they will keep doing business at the same rate. They're actually really stupid people who don't even think about what they're doing. Plus we can just trick them and say they're allowed to build up lots of wealth, but once they acquire it we can just loot their assets as needed. It's a bit rude to them I guess, but remember they are only one person, plus they're assholes or whatever so it's fine. The best part is that the young entrepreneurs of today will watch us pillage the assets of billionaires today and never once stop to think ""Gee, if I ever work to build a successful company, that could someday happen to me!"" They will totally still make a lot of sacrifices in the pursuit of wealth even if the system no longer gives them assurance they'll be able to keep what they earn.
