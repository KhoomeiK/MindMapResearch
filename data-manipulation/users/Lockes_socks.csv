civmaps,fgkbwv9,t1_fgjptza,1580861984.0,Just took a screenshot of the strategic map (VI) and traced it. I took creative liberties with the coastline and rivers and turn reefs into little archipelagos.
banjo,fgkbr6e,t3_eyvrsq,1580861882.0,That's crazy dude. Super cool

civ,fgh5eg2,t1_fgcv6wc,1580777099.0,"No, actually. I love Paradox games in theory,  just find turn-based strategy much more satisfying for some reason. I've put a few hours into HOI4 and Crusader Kings II, but they never resonated the way Civ does."
civ,fggqmbd,t1_fgeaoug,1580767395.0,I've always played Civ with an eye towards roleplaying and crafting a story and a world more than actually winning. I feel like this is an extension of that.
civ,fggq3jq,t1_fgcr618,1580767078.0,"Me too, I just traced a screenshot of the strategic map and added embellishments. You can do it too!"
civ,fgf9p3u,t1_fgealc8,1580731433.0,"I've got to disagree with you on that one. Natural rivers don't flow in a straight line from the highest point to the lowest, they are filled with meanders and oxbows. Just look that the path of the lower Mississippi for a real-life example. Not that the paths of rivers in Civ are super realistic anyway, but I will defend my zippery rivers!"

civ,fgczmdi,t1_fgcnanw,1580677640.0,"I've gotten in the habit of making at least one map for almost all my games. Now that I know /r/civmaps is a thing, I'll probably starting posting them there."
civ,fgcg8c3,t1_fgcec1n,1580672402.0,"Oh, I ""liberated"" it, alright. The people of Fez were a simple, backwards people, though. It was obvious that they couldn't handle self-rule, so I took it upon myself to see to their well-being by occupying the city indefinitely."

civ,fgcbw64,t1_fgc7bog,1580671204.0,"I used a program called FireAlpaca which I saw suggested on this sub. And yeah, I tend to take creative liberties with rivers and borders. Like, all of those little tributaries are in floodplains, and the reservoirs are where I have dams on the rivers."
civ,fgcbfhm,t1_fgca1di,1580671053.0,"They're bombards and musketmen, respectively."

civ,fga9qeq,t3_exo37a,1580648535.0,"R5: I like making maps based on my Civ games. It may not be the prettiest I've seen here, but I thought someone else might find it interesting. This is the first one I've done based on a ""scene from history"", in this case, major troop movements during one of my many conflicts with England.

Yes, the mountains and hills are traced from the strategic map, and the icons are traced from clipart. I'm a history nerd, not an artist."
