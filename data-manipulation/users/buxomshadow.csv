TwoXChromosomes,ffi0bz9,t1_ffi07fj,1579961164.0,"PS.  I am well past menopause.  Where I live, the current state of the health system is such that doctors have very little time for any of their patients.  Things are forgotten.  Internet helps to answer questions.  It's just the way things are."
TwoXChromosomes,ffi07fj,t1_ffhwvzx,1579961042.0,"I was on HRT when I was diagnosed the first time.  Went off it and was prescribed Effexor to replace the HRT.  It worked for a few months and then I weaned off it.  The withdrawal form that drug was horrendous and affected my mental health to the point of near suicide.  I thought it was the meno returning with a vengeance  and talked with the surgeon about resuming HRT, which I did at the lowest dose, as before the cancers.  

I realised that it was the Effexor withdrawal (something oncologists never tell us about) that made me  so sick.  I stopped the HRT when I figured this out, by myself.

The symptoms of everything have subsided and now it is Summer and I had a drinking binge for a week (not sure why but I stopped) and the nightsweats started again.

I refuse to take the SERMs.  I have  had enough of interferences caused by drugs but I can't stay away from public and people all the time.  Going out today made me realise that I can't stand other people.  Maybe it's the culmination of everything and having no family or friends to be there for me, not that I would have benefited from that, anyway.   

Lay off the booze, avoid anti-depressants and wait for recovery.  It has been only six weeks and I am still in pain.  The thought of remote cancers is depressing and I try to not think about it.  

Just confused and seeking opinions.  Thank you for your input."

fatlogic,ffdkpe0,t3_es9tum,1579822926.0,"During perimenopause at age 43, I was about 30 pounds overweight (89 kg) and I despised myself.  After being diagnosed with PCOS, I was given the right medication and laid off the junk.  A year later I was 66 kg and was in a never ending honeymoon with all the freedoms I had regained.  

After menopause, I am now 72 kg and yes, I am fatphobic.  6 kilos is too much and I weigh in every day to make sure I don't go over that number on the scale.   I won't accept the weight gain but I am grateful to myself for losing the excess before menopause or I would be a lot bigger and much unhealthier.  And............I would feel ugly.  I will always be fatphobic and I don't think that is a bad way to be."

I was unapologetically crushed against the window with my backpack and shopping bags and felt very uncomfortable so I asked her to stand up so I could get off the bus.   In honesty, I just wanted to give her the entire seat because she needed the space.    I was being polite to someone who was being rude and FA entitled.  

She didn't give a shit.  No thanks."
fatlogic,ffdgiff,t3_esqqw3,1579820382.0,"I don't like being complimented on weight-loss at all.  It indicates that the teller is implying I was fat.  

I'm in my 50s and weigh-in everyday, whether I like it or not.  Other women my age tell me to 'be careful!'  Careful of what?   I watch my weight and I have a few hangups left over from the '70s when my obese mother was always on some diet or another and all she and her friends would talk about was diet and food. 

I have an EDNOS caused by trauma and grief.  My mother used to smack me if I ate something that was to be saved for a recipe or even if I just ate anything at all.  She always told me I would get fat.  

As an androgynous 16 year old, she told me ""just wait until you have kids!'  I didn't, because I didn't want to get fat.

I'm asked if I eat salads.  Yes, I do but that has nothing to do with my weight-management."

I tried to forge something solid in my life but now live on the public purse, with no kids.  It is like a daily blissful sprinkle of fairy dust upon me!    I get my groceries home-delivered so I don't have to even look at  big miserable families. I seek out places which are not child-friendly.  

My home is not kid-friendly.  It's spartan and clean.  My body is unspoiled.  I can sneeze without leaking.  I still have my figure.  I look after my skin religiously.  I don't feel the need to have a partner.  I sleep when I want to, for as long as I need to.

She used to take me to Parents Without Partners because she was so young that we looked like sisters.  The men thought they were going to get a double deal.  How wrong they were.

I called that organisation Pussies Without Pricks."

At 54, the dating pool gets even more shallow as the men my age have grandchildren,  grown children and at least two mothers of the children, if not more.  Not my circus and definitely not my monkeys.  I consider myself a good catch in that I have nothing to tether me but the men frequently have.  Glad to be a loner who doesn't need a man. It would be nice to go on a date once in a while but there seem to be an undercurrent of expectation that I will just fill the shoes of a grandmother who is not present and really, more power to her.  She has paid her dues.  Sista!"

Today, I left three establishments because I couldn't stand the noise of the kids. One breeder gave me a filthy look as I packed my books and laptop and then asked ""Do you have a problem with children?""  She was as hostile against childfreedom as I was against multiple parenthood.  Screw that noise, literally.  Libraries have turned into creches.  I used to go into one to escape the chaos of the village but now I quickly select the books I want and get out ASAP!

As for kids knowing too much about sex, here is a goodie - just before Xmas a boy was nagging his mother for a toy or some shit and she kept telling him that if he kept on asking, he won't get it.  As he stamped his feet and upended a stand of checkout confectionary, he replied with ""If you don't fucken (sic) buy that thing for me, I 'm gonna (sic) tell Dad I saw you sucking Uncle \*\*\*\*\*\*'s cock so fucken buy it, bitch!""

raisedbynarcissists,fdfggx7,t3_ekru3l,1578361133.0,"NMothers do enjoy making someone suffer and then adding to the suffering.  On Xmas day, when I was 13, my whole family left me at a crowded beach while I was swimming with friends.  I couldn't find our 'camp' and they didn't even leave me a towel or thongs.

I had to walk home in nothing but a very scanty bikini with bare feet for quite a few miles.  The bitumen was hot on my feet and I was sunburned to a crisp all over my body.  I was cat-called and some people pulled over to offer lifts but I was always instructed to not accept lifts from strangers.  I felt like a S\*\*\*.

On returning home, Nbrother told me I was in deep shit and then locked himself in his room.  I know why.  He didn't want to witness the beating I got or the four page letter on how disrespectful I was to my family by leaving the camp to be with friends for a little while.  I was nothing but a s\*\*\* and was grounded for a month which meant I had to wear the wrath of everybody every day.  

Whenever I wonder if I did the wrong thing by extricating myself from these arsehole when I turned 41, I remember that horrible day.  That memory is useful to me.

Aside from that, they frequently left me alone in dangerous situations without a second thought.

She expected accolades and effusive gratitude and if I didn't validate her ego, she turned into a tantruming toddler towards me in private.

 I'm so  sorry she inflicted that on you.  It was criminal and she deliberately made you sick.  I will keep this as short as I can but I what I went through was the same.  Aged 7, I had ear infections. She gave me penicillin in the form of purple, berry-flavoured tabs and told me they were sweets.  They gave me thrush.  

She would examine my privates all the time and she beat me when I scratched.    I was old enough to put the creams on by myself but she didn't allow it.  

The 'sweets' also gave me diarrhea and I missed the toilet often, which would result in a beating.

In my mid teens, I experienced manic episodes with tightness in my joints and jaw.  I moved my jaws a lot, while yelling,  to relieve the tightness.  This made her angry with me.  It went on between ages 12 to 14.  I had the side effects (tardive dyskinesia)  of antipsychotic drugs.

Whenever she had impetigo, she would make me bathe with her.  She would wash my genitals with a nasty soap which hurt.  Again, she hit me whenever I scratched.  So, I had impetigo as well as thrush.

My monster was a nurse and she exploited that training.   She was also sick all the time. Self-inflicted.

I am begging you to never leave your child with that monster, not even if you are in the same room.  It's not that you were a girl.  It was because you were a child and she had power in that.
