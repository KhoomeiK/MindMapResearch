tifu,ffm7pc9,t1_ffm5w2s,1580049929.0,It had that feel to it. Was hoping someone with real experience could say how it’s supposed to go. Cause sure as shit that’s not how you’d let someone do it.

Showerthoughts,fflqy73,t3_ettp82,1580042999.0,"Accidentally called my cousin fat when I was younger, about 7/8. She was trying on our other cousins coat but it wouldn’t fit, I said “it’s because you’re too fat”. She cried for ages. 

20 years later I still think about it. And still feel awful about it. I hope she doesn’t remember but I’m too scared to ask and find out that she does. And I don’t want to bring it up in case it upsets her; “hey remember that time I called you fat”. I don’t think that would help.

I think I was too young to realise the impact the word would have, which makes it worse. I didn’t even mean to hurt her and I did. I just said it without thinking at all, completely matter-of-fact. It was complete ignorance and I’ll carry the guilt for life."
tifu,fflofn4,t3_eu2k1y,1580042110.0,"Why in the name of all that’s good and holy aren’t you trained on a procedure for something like that. Maybe you are and I imagine every case is different, but surely there’s some sort of vague script and procedure to go by when you do something like this? For your and the families’ sake. 

I’m happy to be corrected and told there is in fact training because is this not an awful thing to go through?"
rarepuppers,ffl4hua,t1_ffjyd89,1580034648.0,Completely agree. Even the Instagram one here is perfect. Half the time they’re just random it annoys me more than it should!
rarepuppers,ffl4dky,t1_ffjxuyg,1580034591.0,"You can tell half the people making them don’t understand them. There’s one of Guy Fieri and they’re all just random pictures. The Tinder one is him drinking a glass of red wine. Meanwhile, my experience of men on tinder previously was; photos with unconscious tigers, shirtless photos, holiday shirtless photos and dicks. The memes just don’t hit the mark at all. It’s so annoying (though I don’t know why it bothers me so much)."
Drunkknitting,ffiz3tp,t1_ffiynj0,1579986286.0,Came here to ask the same question!
rarepuppers,ffiyz2k,t3_etukrs,1579986186.0,"This is perfect! I’ve seen so so many of these memes where clearly the authors don’t understand what they’re doing, and the pictures aren’t right. They look so bad. Your wife captured each media/app perfectly!!! Kudos!"
aww,ffh2vee,t3_etib79,1579921628.0,"It’s always around him because it’s so long he has to wrap it around his left leg.

The dogs are also always around him. They’re called Bród and Síoda (Pride and Silk in Irish) and he loves them and they adore him. I could be mistaken but I think Bród is the particularly clingy one that generally is closest to him. If you google them you’ll get loads of photos and videos of them. 

Recently there was a video of them giving out yards from behind a gate, they’d been kept in for some speech or something and weren’t impressed. 

People have asked for them to get an Instagram or twitter account but they haven’t yet unfortunately."
tifu,ffglnyw,t3_etaea9,1579909113.0,Happened me too. Slept on my arm and my hand had gone kind of cold and clammy. When I touched it I honestly thought it was someone else’s. Took all my strength to pull my arm out of my bed and the absolute relief when it was attached to my body.
AskReddit,ffghdo9,t3_etbrdf,1579906270.0,"People believe it but find it ridiculous. 

I’ll preface by saying we didn’t know tea was bad for dogs, we were told it was good for their coat. So we made our black Labrador tea every day. Every lunch we’d make our tea and then put the tea bags in her bowl and then make her a cup. She loved it. Reached the stage where she’d demand tea. 

She’d drink it out of your cup if you left it down anywhere. She was good at sitting by things to ask for something. She’d sit by the back door when she needed to go outside. Then she took to sitting by her bowl. We’d pick it up, empty out the water in it and fill it with fresh water and she’d just look at it and us. But if we picked it up and filled the kettle, she’d go back to her bed and sit in it and wait for her cup of tea. By the end she was demanding at least two a day. 


My previous dog was hooked on tic tacs. My mam quit smoking but transitioned onto mints, then tic tacs. When she finished a packet she’d leave two in it and give it to the dog who would pull the lid off, flick out the tic tacs and eat them. If you wanted her to move off anything all you had to do was rattle a box of tic tacs. 

We have since learned what is and isn’t good for dogs, the joys of the internet and readily available information. And logic obviously. But those dogs knew fully how to guilt my parents. Great doggos. I miss them."
tifu,ff9bcsr,t1_ff8rxw0,1579709088.0,"Agreed, it’s the Sunk cost fallacy:


The sunk cost effect is the general tendency for people to continue an endeavor, or continue consuming or pursuing an option, if they’ve invested time or money or some resource in it. That effect becomes a fallacy if it’s pushing you to do things that are making you unhappy or worse off."
tifu,ff99ede,t1_ff7xpbt,1579707865.0,"What a disgusting way to treat someone though. 

I don’t value you physically except as a sperm bank. Don’t get me wrong treating someone like a sex object is equally bad but Christ on a bike I would feel so awful about myself knowing I was nothing more to my partner. 

Time to leave for sure. She’s awful."

IAmA,femi3fw,t1_femd1s4,1579256708.0,"Objectively speaking the bot is welcoming the opportunity to ask for proof. If you are worried the OP is being untruthful you are entitled and encourage to ask for proof. It’s a bot doing a bot’s job. 

Emotionally speaking, it’s implying the OP is lying. I’d speculate that’s why it’s being downvoted. Or, the OP has provided proof and the bot isn’t contributing anything valuable to this discussion. 

For clarity; I believe OP."

Drunkknitting,femd11f,t1_fekxjes,1579249261.0,"I only learned of it recently, wish I’d known before I practised with a scarf in this stitch. Would have saved some hassle! I’ve had to start the jumper all over once already, I’ve learned my lesson!

Also: respect to your partner for bringing the wine!"
Drunkknitting,fekx69c,t1_fekv6lk,1579209446.0,"Thanks so much, though if I’m honest I’ve no real clue what I’m doing! I’m going to figure it out once I get to the neck and probably ask my mam for help. She’s been knitting clothes for 40 years. 

I have been threading wool through every 5th(ish) row too so if I make a mistake and have to rip it up at least I’ve a placeholder."
knitting,fehdlft,t3_ep2rod,1579114363.0,"I’m trying to knit a jumper, first time ever knitting a jumper and I’m pure winging it in terms of a pattern. 

Wool is Cashmirette Gold in 176.

4mm kneedles and not sure what the stitch is called! I thought it was called brioche, I only recently learned out to do it. 

I’ve decided to thread pink wool through every 5th(ish) row so if I screw it up and have to rip some I don’t have to go back to the start. I’m not experienced enough with this stitch to unknit it or rip it and recover it. Very excited to be trying something new.

Our surname was similar to another house on our road. Starts with G, ends with n and has 4 letters in between. We’d get our post mixed up sometimes. I’m convinced the postman was looking at the names not the addresses and sometimes misread the surname."

She’s a massive animal lover so wondering if the salt thing would keep furry visitors safe."
AskReddit,fdevaky,t3_ekt5n3,1578347340.0,Once went into work 5 hours late. Didn’t set my alarm properly. Explained it to my manager. What can you do. He trusted me well enough to know it wasn’t bullshit.
