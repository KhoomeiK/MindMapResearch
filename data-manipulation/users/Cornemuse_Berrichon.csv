gaybros,fcamk2x,t3_egwzbg,1577572216.0,"Hmmmmmm. It sounds like some trust issues, here. As far as practical advice, you can try to get into his thing and go along, and he'd need to adjust to that (I'm wondering why you feel he doesn't want you along). 

Or you need to let him know that this isn't working for you, because of your feelings, and see how he responds. 

Also, if you're wracked with jealousy, that suggests you have questions around that. Is monogamy what he wants? Is it what you want?

I'm rendering no judgement here: I know polyamorous folks, dudes who just play around apart / together, but are emotionally monogamous, and monogamous guys. But the only reason they work is 1. Each partner has discerned where they are on that spectrum, 2. Each partner has decided where their boundaries are, 3. Everybody has communicated this to each other. 

Hard as it is, ya gotta talk. And you need to be on the same page, or it's gonna be rocky. Good luck, and I hope it all works out."
