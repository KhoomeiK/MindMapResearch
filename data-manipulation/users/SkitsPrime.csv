dogs,fgl7m1q,t3_eyzppb,1580884832.0,"First, I’m so sorry you and your dog have to go through this. It’s heartbreaking. Second, I’ve been in your place twice. My first dog that I had since I was a kid really slowed down and we finally put her down when it was clear she didn’t enjoy anything anymore and she was in too much pain to even walk. My second dog was four when she all of a sudden got really sick. We waited a couple days thinking she ate something in the trash because she had done that before. We caught her making a nest behind the shed to die in and we rushed her to the vet. Turns out she a pancreatitis and diabetes. The vet couldn’t say what caused what, but said that she would never be the same dog again and wouldn’t have a good quality of life if we decided to keep her and inject her with medicines. It was tough, but we knew it was time to let go. We couldn’t force her to stay with us. I know it’s hard and there will be times you question if that’s the right decision, but make sure to ask yourself this: is your dog enjoying life anymore? It’s a horrible question, but it really helps you make that decision. I’m so sorry you’re going through this."
suggestmeabook,fgl76gq,t3_eyvnpi,1580884374.0,“Gamer Army” by Trent Reedy and “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline are really good books for nerds. I loved both and my SO is going to read them once he finishes the “Sword of Truth” series by Terry Goodkind. “Ender’s Game” by Orson Scott Card is also a good book and you don’t have to read the whole series if you don’t want to.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fgl6u1j,t1_fgl5wb0,1580884018.0,Paladins is so much fun. It’s definitely a learning curve.
suggestmeabook,fgl6lop,t1_fgkokka,1580883783.0,You named every book I was going to recommend! But reading is seriously so personal. My SO loves philosophical books like “Art of War” while I struggled to get through it. It takes time to figure out what you like and dislike because nobody has the exact same tastes.
dogs,fg995mq,t3_ex95th,1580635845.0,HE’S SO CUTE!!! I love rescue dogs. They have so much love to give and most are absolutely amazing animals.
DestinyTheGame,fg87a7j,t3_exaz40,1580611409.0,"My SO and I have played since the beginning, so has our best friend. None of us have titles and it gets so frustrating. We went hard for one for a while before stopping and basically just saying it’ll happen eventually."
horror,ffvtky8,t3_evbrpi,1580272867.0,I wish this movie had more recognition! It was so good and the actors were really good too. I’m still terrified to go near crawl spaces after this movie.
suggestmeabook,ffrj7pa,t3_euqssc,1580159111.0,"“Adventurers Wanted” by M.L. Forman is a good series for those ages. It’s got magic, adventures, friends, and dragons in the books. “Kingdom Keepers” by Ridley Pearson is also a good series if they enjoy Disney. I’m currently reading through the series myself and I’m loving it."
suggestmeabook,ffritah,t3_eutikz,1580158866.0,"Try “Girl, Wash Your Face” and “Girl, Stop Apologizing” by Rachel Hollis. They’re both really good and have humor throughout. They helped me through some hard times and have helped me become more confident in myself."
writing,ffi6li6,t3_etna9j,1579966452.0,"If you really want to write while set in America, you need to heavily research the area your story is taking place. No two states are the same and culture ranges wildly based on region. It’s not impossible to write a story set in America while not being American, but you’ll need to do a lot of research. Don’t just rely on what the news says either. Look online at YouTube, read some blogs, maybe even try to get in touch with someone that area to ask them questions."
suggestmeabook,ffhfaq7,t3_etk8kv,1579932832.0,“Report from Ground Zero” by Dennis Smith changed my mind about nonfiction. I despised nonfiction and I chose to read this as my book for school one year because it had to be nonfiction. The stories in this book about 9/11 are wrenching and put in the moments.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ff1d5qe,t3_eqwrj8,1579477660.0,I say buy it. My SO made me play it and I fell in love with the game. It’s such an interesting take on the zombie theme that it doesn’t feel generic. The characters also feel so realistic to me instead of just being there for some dialogue or something.
suggestmeabook,fejbwhg,t1_fejb40p,1579166246.0,I read that series years ago! It’s so good. I need to reread because it’s been ages.
suggestmeabook,fej6iix,t1_fej56j5,1579158913.0,My SO loves his writing and is the one having me read Sword of Truth. I’ve been enjoying it so far.
suggestmeabook,feirr3a,t1_feipwz8,1579145547.0,I’ve been meaning to finish the series. I read the first before the others came out and just didn’t keep up.
suggestmeabook,feirp5p,t1_feiprfi,1579145510.0,One of my friends just read this and loves it. I’ll have to look at it!

suggestmeabook,feifxam,t1_fegolnc,1579137599.0,I’m just starting Jurassic Park. It’s a great book. Have you read The Martian by Andy Weir? It gives me similar feels to Jurassic Park with the science aspect.
suggestmeabook,feifrx0,t1_fehrg3m,1579137499.0,"Don’t ever be ashamed of what you enjoy reading. Twilight wasn’t my cup of tea, but my best friend adores it and several others love it too. Read what you want to read and ignore the haters. You should check out the House of Night series by P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast. It’s a vampire series and it’s awesome."
suggestmeabook,feifdsi,t1_feif7jg,1579137235.0,I’ve heard American Gods is really good. I’ll have to check it out.
suggestmeabook,feif9mz,t1_feht3wr,1579137161.0,I’ve heard about this one recently and it’s been on my list ever since.
suggestmeabook,feif8eo,t1_fei6r5a,1579137136.0,Vampire Academy has been on my list for a while. It seems so good.
suggestmeabook,feif78s,t1_fehymis,1579137113.0,I read the first book before the others came out and kind of forgot about it. Thanks for reminding me! I remember loving the first book.
suggestmeabook,feif5ln,t1_fehs552,1579137083.0,I’ve never heard of this one before. I’ll definitely check it out.
suggestmeabook,feif3aq,t1_fehl48v,1579137039.0,"I love this series! I ran out of time to finish all of them, but I need to pick them back up."
suggestmeabook,feif1k6,t1_fehl3o4,1579137006.0,One of my good friends raves about this. I’ll have to check it out.
suggestmeabook,feif0em,t1_fehr8b2,1579136984.0,I haven’t heard of this one before. Thanks!
dogs,fehidqo,t3_ep5jpm,1579117158.0,"I was in a similar situation a couple years ago with my dog. There is no right or wrong answer here and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. In my opinion, it’s better now than later when your pup is in too much pain for anything. If she can’t do much and doesn’t do things she used to love, I feel it might be time."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fdpguhj,t3_emh1q1,1578628270.0,"My SO and I like playing it during off-times for other games. It gets a little tiresome to me if we only play that for really long periods of time, but it’s fun when we’re in between games or waiting for updates."
suggestmeabook,fdexww6,t1_fdeihic,1578348938.0,I love the book! I need to reread it and then read the sequels.
