Anxiety,ffnyn6u,t1_ffklce2,1580072335.0,"I had a similar experience, I went to the doctor after a panic attack because I believed there was something actually wrong. I was diagnosed with asthma and prescribed an inhaler. I used it for a few days like I was told but then when I came back there wasn’t a problem and I was just told to “keep an eye on it.” This was over a year ago and I haven’t used an inhaler since, so I think it was just anxiety. But it’s weird that that caused the doctor to think I was wheezing (or maybe I actually was wheezing)."
ApplyingToCollege,ffd61xy,t1_ffd23bh,1579814120.0,"Yeah, this is an incredibly unprofessional and shitty thing to do. It’s only excusable if there was some terrible emergency that completely precluded them from being able to contact you and cancel; otherwise it shows they just don’t give a fuck.

People who behave like this shouldn’t be doing interviews. I don’t care if they volunteered, I don’t care if they’re unpaid, that’s not how you act."

Opening the window just a crack is helpful to prevent excessive heat, and it’s usually not too cold unless you’re literally sitting next to the window."

starterpacks,fenmjwi,t1_fenjhy4,1579287888.0,"Graduated high school a couple years ago, can confirm. You’d literally have 15 kids in there and you couldn’t even physically get to a urinal. It got so bad that they started to have administrators go into the bathroom between periods. Either that or they just locked us out of them."
neoliberal,fen71xd,t1_femyqyr,1579278388.0,"In the video he literally said he doesn’t want Biden, Pete, or Warren on his show. Also he’s never interviewed a sitting moderate Democrat or Republican. The only politicians I’ve think he’s had on are Gabbard, Sanders, and Crenshaw."
college,feklpvy,t3_epjhi2,1579202664.0,"I think mediating a conversation could actually be helpful. Yes, you can talk to him yourself, but with a third party listening to your concerns and validating them, he might feel differently. Maybe he thinks that what he’s doing is fine and it’s just a problem with you, but if you get a third party involved and they tell him you’re at least somewhat right, maybe he’ll change his mind

But yeah being mean is justified at this point since you’ve already been polite and even firm, and what he’s doing is just not right. You have a right to live comfortably in your space and he’s actively and knowingly denying you that."
NEU,fejuqbg,t3_epe14e,1579186295.0,"In depends what you mean by CS. If you mean software engineering, you’re probably gonna face a good deal of competition from actual CS majors since they’ve taken the courses that specifically prepare you for that. But your experience is worth something and it’s still worth applying to those roles obviously.

But you’d probably be better off in a data science/data analytics role. The business background helps for those, because really a lot of those jobs are business jobs disguised as technical roles. Usually those roles, at least the tech-heavier roles that I assume you’re interested in, use Python, SQL, and things like that."
college,fehto6q,t3_ep1or8,1579123652.0,"I lost 30 lb in a semester (over the course of 4 months) on the meal plan. My schedule looked roughly like this:

8am: eat a big breakfast. Usually it consisted of eggs, some form of potato, and some form of meat. And a cup of fruit. Usually around 800 calories

12pm: some kind of light snack. Usually nuts or seeds. About 300 calories. 

3-4pm: a big meal. Usually some kind of meat, vegetable, and side. Probably 600-800 calories 

I started off overweight to begin with, so by eating 1900 calories a day I still lost weight.  But if you need to eat fewer than that, you can easily modify this schedule to just eat less per meal. The real trick is to only eat one plate at the dining hall. My problem was that I would eat a healthy plate but then have a junk plate or more afterward. But when I switched to only one plate, I just put all the healthy stuff on one plate and avoided the junk."
NEU,fecr63s,t3_enfj6o,1578981546.0,"My club always welcomes new members and expects at least a few new people at the beginning of the spring. I’m sure a lot of other clubs have similar expectations due to NU.in and co-op meaning this semester is kind of like the fall semester for a lot of people.

Although some clubs by their nature will have a hard time taking new people, like anything that revolves around a long term project or competition or stuff like that, but you can always reach out to whoever’s on E-boards and ask"
fasting,feboev3,t1_fe9fxmn,1578961026.0,"I don’t think the purpose of cyclical keto is to maintain ketosis. It’s to maintain it during the week but then to not be in it on the weekend. But your body takes a few days to enter into it if I’m correct so I’m not sure if that’s what happens. 

I think it’s mostly for athletes who want to train on carbs but on days where they’re not doing intense workouts they’re fine not eating them.

But yeah if you eat crap on the weekends it still won’t be a good diet. Your carbs still have to be good carbs"
Cooking,fe8oae6,t1_fe8jh80,1578928505.0,"Yeah but that’s the same thing as saying “well you can eat a burger everyday as long as it’s made from turkey, is on a 9 grain bun, and has at least a cup of vegetables on it.” The pizza in the video wasn’t like that, which is why she said it’s not healthy. Anything that comes from dough is probably not a great thing to eat every day because even if it’s homemade it’s still in some sense processed. It’s just a more processed carb than something like sweet potato or barley. 

Cheese is also probably not a great thing to eat all the time because it’s high in saturated fat and sodium.

Tomato sauce is healthy, but a lot of jarred varieties have a lot of sugar and salt.

Also there’s the fact that because it’s processed, pizza isn’t all that filling. You can eat the same quantity of a lot of other things and feel more full."
NEU,fe4z00d,t1_fe4y71a,1578864154.0,"Oh, it’s a federal program in the US that gives certain people, on a need-based basis, the ability to get part time jobs on campus. Since the money comes from the government instead of from the school itself, on campus hiring tends to prefer hiring people with work study. But you can definitely still get a job without it, it’s just harder."
NEU,fe4w9i6,t3_enpupa,1578863389.0,A lot of those jobs are really hard to get without work study. It doesn’t hurt applying though.
rareinsults,fdw7k3g,t1_fdw140k,1578755914.0,"I don’t know, I think fast food will always have a market for young people. First of all you have teenagers who eat it and on average don’t care a ton about their health (think like 14-18). Then you have people who live in rural or suburban areas who know it’s bad for you but also don’t have much else in the way of food places and are too lazy/don’t have enough time to cook all the time. Then you have people who just can’t afford anything else and don’t have the time and energy to do /r/eatcheapandhealthy. Then there’s people who eat it when they “cheat” on their diets. And finally there’s people who just don’t care that it’s unhealthy and eat it anyway because it tastes good.

You’re right that overall millennials are more health-conscious than their predecessors, and we know a lot more about the harms of fast food now, but this isn’t enough to actually hurt the industry in the long term. There will always be people who want it and who either can’t or won’t not eat it."

NEU,fdrd70q,t3_empfh0,1578682842.0,"It’s rare, especially in business, but it happens. Your chances of not getting one decrease dramatically though if you engage in the process fully. That means doing mock interviews, writing good cover letters when required, making a good resume, not being picky with where you apply, etc. Your advisor will definitely help you with all this, but it’s on you to actually put in the effort. 

If you don’t get one, your advisor can’t force anyone to hire you. Sometimes they can give the employer a nudge if you applied somewhere and haven’t heard back at all, but that’s something they can do for you anyway. But nobody is guaranteed a coop since nobody has to hire you. 

The worst case scenario is you take classes next semester and then go on coop after that, so you’d be on the spring cycle. Yeah it kind of sucks but it’s not the end of the world."
caloriecount,fdphiwh,t1_fdoftid,1578628783.0,200-300 would be my guess without “aiming high” or “aiming low.” I think 100 is definitely too low although 150 could be reasonable. 500-600 seems way too high
ApplyingToCollege,fdi32t5,t1_fdi0k06,1578434855.0,"For all of high school and the first half of senior year you’re expected to be perfect with good grades, good EC’s, etc. But all that is over once the second semester hits. Which means you’ll either slack off and stop doing EC’s, or you’ll keep doing what you were doing beforehand. The latter shows that you genuinely did all those things for the sake of doing them while the former shows you just did them for the resume padding"
bestof,fdd79j0,t1_fdcyoh6,1578297942.0,"Yes. Ted Kennedy ran against Carter in 1980 in the primary. He lost, but conventional wisdom says that it damaged Carter in that election. Hard to tell though since it was a landslide and Carter probably would’ve lost anyway. 

But it’s highly, highly unlikely that there will be a serious challenge this time. Trump has a higher approval rating in his party than Carter had, and the party itself is much more powerful and unified than the Democratic Party was in 1980."
college,fdahxnd,t3_ekehjt,1578246290.0,"I think it’s about direct uses. Like STEM majors I think for the most part see the value in liberal arts degrees, but the difference is that these degrees develop your “soft skills” like communication while STEM develops your “hard skills” like coding. They’re both equally important, but I think there’s a perception that soft skills are less so. This may be because there’s a belief that you can “learn them on the job” while hard skills you can’t. And the second thing is that STEM degrees often are associated directly with certain jobs while liberal arts degrees aren’t. Like an engineering major will definitely do engineering, but a history major will not definitely do history. 

Of course this perception is wrong, but it comes about because it’s harder for people to draw a direct link between skills and jobs with liberal arts degrees. But that link is definitely there."

learnmath,fcoq7iy,t3_eia74z,1577838647.0,"A function means that for any input there can be at most one output. This means that for the y= form, if any x value yields more than one y value, it’s not a function. The y= form is y=(plus or minus)sqrt(16-x^2). The plus or minus already means there’s multiple answers for each x value in (-4,4), so we know it’s not a function. For example for x=1 you get sqrt(15) and -sqrt(15). The vertical line test confirms this by the way and this is why it works in the first place; if a vertical line crosses the graph more than once, that’s the same thing as saying one x value maps to more than one y value."
learnmath,fcopiza,t1_fcomxaw,1577838149.0,"Because a curve can also be a function. It’s the correct answer but the wrong reason. It’s like saying “A square isn’t a pentagon, it’s a 2d shape.” Technically there’s nothing wrong but the implied justification of “it’s a 2d shape so it can’t be a pentagon” is wrong."
shittyfoodporn,fcnpbm6,t1_fcmawmw,1577815875.0,"To me the only “shitty” thing about it is the rotisserie chicken.

AskReddit,fcl8lv3,t1_fcl734a,1577742167.0,"Yeah, fat isn’t inherently bad for you but way too many people eat way too much saturated fat. It’s like how carbs aren’t inherently bad for you but eating excessive amounts of white bread is. Too much of the wrong kind of fat is bad for you"

But then when you eventually have your own room you wonder why you were ever okay with living like that. It’s such a huge difference honestly and I think the people who actually like having roommates are people who end up or already are close to their roommates, which may be a lot but I think is still a minority of people."
aftergifted,fckidmf,t1_fck3gko,1577725999.0,"Yeah, and you don’t even need to do it in the first place. You can examine an offensive or controversial argument without making it yourself and that’s probably a good thing to do. 

Also in my experience the vast majority of people doing it are just doing it for attention or because there’s nothing else they can contribute. Like in a class we’d have a thorough discussion about discrimination for example and why it’s bad, but then some genius would have to raise their hand at the end and be like “but just to play devil’s advocate, what if discrimination was *good*?” because everything to say about why it’s bad has already been said. It’s completely counterproductive. It’s not “intellectual” it doesn’t lead to good “debate” it’s just a waste of time. Some stances, especially non controversial ones, don’t need any extra “examining”, and even if they do, devil’s advocate is probably the worst way to go about doing it."
shittyfoodporn,fc5w6ow,t1_fc4rqfn,1577467186.0,"There’s a difference between moist and wet though. The fact that these look very dense and not fluffy signals that they are undercooked i.e. wet. Maybe it’s just the lighting or maybe cooked strawberry brownies are just supposed to look like that but compared to normal brownies these are wet and undercooked, even for someone who prefers more moist brownies. Also the limpness isn’t helping; brownies aren’t supposed to be soggy, they’re supposed to hold their shape."
