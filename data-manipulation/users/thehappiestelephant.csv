If they'll penny pinch you on your salary, it shows that they'll try to low-ball your worth in every other aspect (benefits, time off, etc) - basically they undervalue you because they think they can get away with it even though, when push comes to shove, they recognize you're worth more."

AmItheAsshole,ffg9zvf,t1_ffg95gj,1579901664.0,"It's the distance, or lack thereof, that makes it acceptable or uncomfortable. There's a bit of a disconnect when donating to a stranger compared to actually watching her biological son or daughter be raised in front of her as her nephew or niece.

I understand there are strong opinions on both sides. Ultimately it's her decision and she happens to feel uncomfortable with it.

I hadn't made an actual judgment but I would have gone with N A H... if the brother hadn't called her selfish for saying no. He can ask, yes. And she can give either a yes or a no. He needs to accept whichever answer she gives. I understand he was disappointed. He still needs to accept that it's her call.

AmItheAsshole,fffgfnx,t1_fffdo3q,1579883409.0,"She's not though. The two times she had eggs harvested was specifically to donate. Just because she has eggs remaining from the last harvest doesn't mean she's obligated to donate them, especially to family or friends. And no, simply because more eggs were harvested than used does not mean she is obligated to let them be used since that was the intended purpose. They used what they needed and there were eggs remaining. Which means they are hers to decide what to do with.

There's a reason that closed adoptions are common, often the bio parent wants to do right by the fetus but can't bear the proximity to their child. In this case there's no fetus to do right by and it would be very difficult for OP to literally watch someone else raise her child.

In that case I do understand not wanting to turn down free housekeeping but it's still more important to be a self-sufficient household. I second giving MIL a card with an invitation to something (dinner, outing, etc) explaining that you value her presence over what chores she does for you. Maybe tell her you can do your own chores but only she can provide her presence, which you enjoy.

Something about having it in writing makes it easier to process on your own time, allows any negative knee-jerk reaction to pass, and lets you to go back and re-read kind words when you need a reminder.

It's not the chore itself. It's that your partner noticed there is something you don't really want to do and they chose to 1) notice it needs to be done, 2) understand that you don't really want to do it, but you're going to anyway because it has to be done, and 3) choosing to do it for you as an act of service to show you they love you. Another example is cooking a meal for you, or going to pick up cold medicine when you're feeling sick. Not just chores, but chores happen daily so there are more opportunities to perform Acts of Service as chores.

If you don't understand that, that's fine - it just means Acts of Service isn't one of your primary love languages. The five are Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch. Yours may be one or two of the others."

I disagree. If you can't afford awedding, don't have a wedding. But a marriage license and officiant is all you need to be legally married and that's typically under $100-$200. It's all the extraneous things that inflate the cost. You can even find rings inexpensively these days if you forego diamonds.

People used to get married in their living room, in their best outfit, surrounded by nearby family and friends, and the reception was cake, mints, nuts and punch also served in the living room.

Then Queen Victoria wore a white dress and royalty/celebrities started having (widely broadcasted) extravagant weddings. That's somehow become the standard for the average couple, and the wedding industry has done a fantastic job equating money spent to the amount of love present when the [opposite](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/wedding-cost-marriage-divorce-ring-how-much-price-study-a8435646.html) is true.
