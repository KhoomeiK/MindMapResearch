WatchPeopleDieInside,fd5l6ax,t1_fd5dz44,1578178687.0,"I commented part of it, but I can tell the whole thing. My parents have 10 acres of wooded land in north west Minnesota. My sister and I had a trampoline that was put into a little clearing a little ways into the woods. One fall day I was playing with my barbies on the trampoline. I wasn't wearing high visibility clothing because I was basically in my yard so I didn't think I had to. After being out there for a while I heard some gunshots. It's not unusual to hear gunshots out in the country because people often practice shooting or test their sights for the upcoming deer season, but these sounded uncomfortably close. I then saw an orange vest in the distance. I moved farther back on the trampoline and thought about running inside, but then I was worried if I ran he might just see movement and shoot me. I heard another gunshot right as a breeze came by and I remember thinking ""wow, that breeze really hurt"". I was in shock and it didn't really click what happened, but I started crying and ran as fast as I could down the trail and back to my house. When I got inside my mom asked what was wrong and I managed to sputter out that I heard gunshots and then she said ""oh my god, you're bleeding!"" She called for my dad and he ran outside to find the guy. Meanwhile my mom was getting me in the car to drive me to the ER. (It's faster to drive there than to wait for an ambulance). I remember thinking ""I don't want to die"" over and over again. I was so scared. I saw my dad drag a guy out of the woods and break his shot gun, I couldn't tell who it was at the time. He was yelling at him and I thought he was going to kill him. Then my dad came to the car and we all went to the ER. I remember the cops coming to the ER but I didn't hear what my parents said to them. They did an X-Ray and the doctor told us it was too risky to remove because it was so close to my carotid. He said I was extremely lucky to be alive, and me moving to a different place on the trampoline likely saved my life. I later learned it was my dad's best friend's brother who shot me, and although my parents were obviously pissed at him, they decided not to press charges because they didn't want to fuck up things for his wife and kids. The pellet is still in my neck 20 years later."
