AmITheKaren,ff8ywrs,t1_ff8y9vl,1579700458.0,"That sucks when people follow you around. I'm sorry.

My advice for communities you can talk to is to look for smaller communities focused on things you like, although you'll still have to be open to disagreement and have to remember that, even though it's a smaller community anytime can see posts and comment. I've since disengaged from them, but I've found subs where the members even host meetups and talk regularly in group chats."
AmITheKaren,ff8x1yu,t3_es2nna,1579698890.0,">I get these smart a**holes who wanna bring facts into a opinion based discussion and post long a** paragraphs about how my ""OPINION"" is wrong

If you don't want people to argue with your opinions don't post them on the internet. And if facts contradict your opinion, maybe it's wrong, not every opinion is equally valid. For something like earbuds are better than earphones it doesn't really matter, though, just do you.

 You just can't call it harassment when you post your opinion on an opinion sub and multiple people dosagree in seperate comments. Unless they're following your posts around or making it more personal. 

I quickly checked that particular post and it looked like only one person really disagreed and other people talked about how they, personally, can't use earbuds they tried or else agreed with you."

Or plan an activity together instead of buy a gift? I would also explain how you feel, I also often like small gifts, and it's not so much about the physical gift but about someone thinking of me and taking time to get me something."

For what it's worth, our dog is a Nova, and we even spread it out, stretching out the ""no"" as Nooooo-va in a sing song voice and she doesn't seem confused. TBF, normally when we do that we are frustrated with her and want to emphasize the ""no"" without yelling at her or stressing her out."

dogs,fcumc59,t3_eiynrb,1577984094.0,"I want to vent about my dog without making a whole post.

My husband got up for work and left the dogs out this morning, as I rested. A little after he got in the shower, an absolutely vile smell hit me and I jumped out of bed expecting to see one of our dogs being sick and wanting to let them out before too much damage was caused. They were sitting there like nothing happened, so I searched for some disgusting poop somewhere and couldn't find any. My husband got out of the shower and also couldn't find it. After a few minutes of searching we realized that our lovely dog had found some weird animal's poop outside and scent rolled. It was all over his collar and in his fur. So he got a bath, despite getting flea medication yesterday afternoon. And I'm in the process of watching any bedding he might have touched and shampooing all our carpets as the guilty party whines that I haven't walked him yet. Sometimes dogs are amazing and wonderful, but sometimes they're the most frustrating things in the world. 

Tl;dr: my dog scent rolled in the most disgusting smelling poop I've ever smelled."

We didn't hear about this until someone mentioned it when we were discussing food at the pet store. Grain free is really pushed as healthier for dogs and it really gets confusing for well meaning people without all the information."

She can't just go around claiming everybody.

You suck because the way you went about it. If you were just like ""hey, I've actually been into Trevor gir a while and want to make sure that you're okay if I act on it"" giphy would be in the clear. What you did was a little weird and didn't take anyone's feelings but yours into account and then you insinuated it was because she was jealous of you."
AmItheAsshole,fchfhcd,t3_eha4ov,1577649955.0,"YTA you say you wanted to be her friend, but should you treat a guy friend the same way, with good morning and good night messages and hearing every day without a response? You thought you'd create a close talking every day friendship without considering what she wants or building a foundation. It doesn't sound like she wants ti be your friend because you creeped her out. Don't message her any more at all."

>I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together.

I don't know your dynamic and why they have less time or if they'd like more. I saw another comment saying he hadn't asked the courts, but changing parenting plans is hard and you need a really good reason. I don't know if your daughter loves their family, but you don't need to throw shitty remarks to people unrelated to this. Your daughter can call whoever she wants dad, and I see his feelings being hurt by it, but he shouldn't have blown exploded at you."
