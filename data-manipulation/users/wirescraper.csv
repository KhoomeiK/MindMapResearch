Talking does help, but only temporarily.  I’m on pills for depression which drives me nuts.  I’m on pills to sleep which is hard to swallow.  The thoughts are almost paralyzing, but I have no choice but to try to do my job every day and navigate through this pain.  I broke up with her because I felt so overwhelmed and have regretted it ever since.  The effects of depression were setting in and then became extreme, leaving me feeling unworthy to try to get her back.  Since then I’ve gone downhill to the depths of my own personal hell.  Some days I’m functionally down, other days I’m nearly suicidally low.  I just want to forget, or win her back.  Why do I hold onto hope when I’m shattering before my eyes.  To make matters worse I have kids, I should be stronger than this, for them.  Why is it not enough, why am I so weak?  I need to stop with the depressing thoughts, pick myself up and get back in shape.  It’s just so hard when I feel like there’s no hope.

I’ve gotten to where I want my ex to be happy, get her brains fucked out and feel amazing... she’s the mother of my kids and I want her to feel whole and happy, so that she can be an engaged Mom.  Yeah, it hurts a little and maybe a lot... I’ve never been so accustomed to emotional pain as I am now post divorce.  Just know brother that I can relate, I am where you’re at and we can get through the shit.  We can only control ourselves (to some extent) and the ex has to live her own life.

I’ve never had cancer, but if guaranteed that I’d never have a depressive episode again so long as i live, but I’d have to trade a year or more of my life to battle cancer to full or mostly full recovery... well, I’d give it some serious thought."
depression,fdizuln,t1_fdiw64g,1578454884.0,"Some day, something’s got to give, something needs to give us hope...there needs to be a light at the end of the tunnel, but I have no clue what that would even look like."

depression,fdiyuh1,t3_eldea8,1578454196.0,"I listen to podcasts all day so that my mind isn’t focused on my situation.  When I’m depressed, music makes me more depressed...dunno why, but music hurts me right in the chest.  I like listening to true crime or history podcasts.  I kinda like hearing stories of true crime, hoping to hear a story where someone is worse off than I am, but no matter how awful the story, the subject seems to have risen above their circumstance and redeemed themselves... then I’m left wondering , “well wtf is my problem.”  I just move through the day pushing myself to get the job done as quick as I can (electrician),  and then move on to the next.  It’s all I can do to muster up the energy for those 8 hours.  Then at the end I sink back into my own personal hell.  Hopefully I’ve eaten, taken my meds, and done something else productive, then off to bed with more pills.  Rinse-Repeat.  Oh, and I have 3 kids to care for 1/2 the time and an ex wife to pay alimony to.  If I lose my job I’m screwed.  I sometimes wonder how long I can carry on like this... feeling empty, with nothing to look forward to."
depression,fdhbdsa,t1_fdg7h67,1578419346.0,"It’s tough navigating through the darkness, inaction feeds anxiety... the bad days seem to erase any progress made... only faith that it’ll get better, that there’s some reason for this... some hope that there’s a better future following whatever transformation I’m experiencing.... keeps me going.  I just divorced and had a breakdown a couple months ago...  barely holding it together."
depression,fdfp2gs,t1_fde0sen,1578366815.0,"It’s a seemingly monumental task that would be a trivial simple task when well.  That is, doing the necessary chores of a person who is well... funny, they’re not chores when you’re well, things like socializing, getting something to eat, making plans, doing hobbies or activities.  Yet here I am ... trying to muster up all the will power I have left just to take a shower, looking for solace in the internet so that I don’t feel so alone... meanwhile I have 3 kids here with me getting ready for bed while I attempt to get things done and hope they don’t notice what is going on inside my head."

depression,fcz7w9v,t3_ejngix,1578095459.0,I understand.  There was a time when I was excited about hobbies and dating and really anything and everything... with depression it’s just all so exhausting and I fear the money it costs to do the thing.

I’d bet that in those days the suicidal rate was 0, life was more valuable and people saw more meaning in it.  Sure it was more difficult, but here I am, comfortable and miserable."
