But you're right. Humans are totally inferior. Cows are always sending shit into space and using complex mathematics to better understand their universe. My God, those tardigrades...

Sarcasm aside. I understand what you're saying. Some animals are highly evolved to be the best at what they do. The fact remains though, humans can either learn to do it better, or invent something that means we don't have to do what the other animals do. We night jot be as strong as a gorilla, as fast as a cheetah, or as big as an elephant, but we are still absolutely superior.

It's also shaped me into a kind of materialistic person, too. Not in the sense that I would judge anyone for what they do or don't have within their means. But I like having things that are frivolities, I guess it's compensation for going without certain things growing up.

A couple of senators give examples of why the right to repair is a good thing. 

Sen. Hasegawa (not sure on the spelling) points out that he had a devices battery replaced, but after suffering an issue that requires the device to be returned to the manufacturer, they told him they couldn't touch the device because it had been to an unauthorized 3rd party repair centre, and he was left with a brick. 

Sen. Christine Rolfes analogizes the right to repair to her own grandfather's cobbing business. She states that cobbling was a good business. Shoes cost a lot to replace and it was more cost effective to have them repaired. She states that small electronic repair businesses are the 21st century equivalent to a cobbler. She makes a good analogy about it. 

Olivia Webb, of iFixit, states that she has personally repaired several devices using the guides that iFixit provides, but die to her inability to spice genuine parts, the repairs were ultimately short lived. 

Adelle Pomeroy, of Free Geek, works to refurbish devices for people who are without, however they find themselves having to reverse engineer those devices in order to be able to repair them, which isn't a good position for a non-profit. 

Adrian Avery Johnson, a small repair business owner in Portland, doesn't have access to documents, manuals, schematics, and diagnostic tools which means that he spends way more time than he should have to just to find out what a component is. He also gives an example of how a parent of a child with a knack for shoving oatmeal into things brought him 3 devices to repair. A Kindle, a MacBook, and a Garmin. The parent had been told that total device replacement was the only option at the authorized service centres, however Adrian was able to repair all 3 devices for less than the cost of a replacement tablet. 

Louis Rossman, of Rossman repair group, points out that 50-70 years ago, an electronic device would have a schematic allowing it to be worked on, and parts were widely available. He then states that in order to repair the charging system on a MacBook, he has to purchase an iPhone battery charging kit, rip it apart, and then dispose of the battery, all for a chip, because Apple tells the manufacturer of the chip to only sell it to Apple. This means that Apple is the only real option for device repair, which comes at a huge cost, as well as data loss as they wipe all devices. He also touches on the fallacy of manufacturers claiming that it's dangerous to repair a phone, but people are fine to replace the brake pads on their car. He references an ad (AutoZone, I think) to clarify this. 

Enter the bad guys...

Charlie Brown, with the Consumer Technology Association. He's just a babbling mess who focuses on the dangers of repairing a device yourself. 

Samantha Kersul. Technet. She basically insinuates that it's unconscionable that small business could make a profit from 'legit' repairs. She also claims that giving consumers the right to repair infringes on the intellectual property rights of the device manufacturer. 

Katheryn Gunter, Entertainment Software Association. She claims, in a roundabout way, that the right to repair is detrimental to manufacturers as it is considered piracy. She seems to consider repairing a device the same as modifying it to play pirates games. 

Anna Powell of CompTIA more or less claims that the right to repair bill would be the end of all security and privacy for connected devices. 

As I said, I only got half way through, but that's the gist of it. All of the pro side were very well spoken with good arguments. The big business guys were mostly mumbling, stuttering idiots who clearly had no idea what they were actually fighting. None of them made any good points, but did we expect them to?

I don't think it's fair to generalize all pop-up cameras based on one device. That's like saying no phone should have a camera at all because *insert-device-name-here* has an awful camera. The Mi 9T, while for sure a solid phone, and an absolute bargain for what you get, is half the price and almost half the phone as the OP7 Pro, so I would be hesitant to believe off the bat that they have the same camera system. I could be wrong though. 

Samsung don't make *bad* phones. They make average phones with an Apple price tag. I had the Note 10+ and it was a huge disappointment. It wasn't much brighter, screen-wise, than my OP6, and the colours were drastically washed out no matter which setting I used. It's only saving grace was the camera. Samsung make phones with solid cameras. That's something that I will always admit. My OP7 Pro, for all it's brilliance, still has an average camera.

Nah, the OnePlus 8, in all it's forms, is looking like it's going to be a repeat of the absolute shitnugget that was the OnePlus 2. The 8T won't have any significant improvement over the 8, just like 7T had no real.improvement over the 7. If OnePlus can steal some Samsung, or other big name manufacturers, customers then they won't have any reason to continue making 'budget' flagship killers. They'll just settle into the 'make a piece of shit phone, and just update the number every year' cycle. The 7 Pro was the first true flagship from OnePlus. Great screen, battery, camera, etc. Now they look to be taking a step backwards. 

I don't actually have a problem with the pricing of OnePlus devices, even as they've grown much more expensive. A phone with a flagship processor, more RAM, great screen etc. For a couple of hundred less than the competition and with a decent UI? Sign me up. But, unfortunately, OxygenOS will never quite be enough on its own to make me buy a OnePlus.

The battery issue isn't going to be fixed by Samsung. ASUS' ROG phone 2 has an enormous battery. There is no reason at all.thag Samsung wouldn't be able to fit a battery like that into their flagships if it wasn't for the fact that they don't want to do it, because it would increase the lifespan of their phone. 

Not enough people have had the *opportunity* to decide whether or not they like the motorized camera. They have a reason for the change, of course, and it's money. The leak was for the 8 Pro, their flagship model.

On the other hand, if phone manufacturers don't incorporate it into theie devices, then what incentive is there for carriers to start building a 5G network that's actually usable. I'd prefer more space for a larger battery than a 5G modem at this point. I would be fine with manufacturers reverting to a notch system and getting rid of motorized cameras, I just won't buy a phone, especially not from a brand that is now charging flagship prices, with a hole-punch camera."
Android,fdxifp1,t1_fdwbcew,1578768998.0,"What the hell could be in the way? You're forcefully creating a problem if that happens. 

It's not that they want other manufacturers to test stuff first. It's that they only pretend to innovate. If they had truly innovative technology, people wouldn't be suckered into buying a new phone every 12 months. Battery tech is where innovation needs to happen more than anywhere else. 

It's cool. I wasn't offended. Like I said, it's all subjective. I'm just tired of people making up facts about motorized cameras when the evidence proves them false. 

If you were to take a look at a Samsung focused post, you would see that motorized camera lovers would be shunned. The r/Android subreddit is full of Samsung fanboys and low end phone advocates. There doesn't appear to be much in-between. 

I agree that it's better to have different options. But for me, taking a brand that I love, because they always pair top end hardware with a very clean UI, and conpw5ltly ruining it so that they can try and steal some of Samsung's market share is very against what I always believed OnePlus to be about.

You can have it set so that you have to slide/swipe to activate the function, or you can set it so that as soon as the screen is powered on by the power button, it activates. It's ever so slightly slower than fingerprint unlock, but it's still quicker than any unlock method on the Note 10+ for example. I just set it up to test it out. I press the power button, and as soon as I do, the camera pops out. The camera has barely finished popping out before my phone is unlocked. The difference between the camera and fingerprint method is almost imperceptible. 

People are making points about the tests that have been done on motorized cameras and getting downvoted. I don't see why. I can open the front camera, and feign a phone 'drop'. If I allow my phone to free-fall from one hand to the other, just a few inches, by the time I've caught it, the camera has retracted back in. The mechanism has a gasket to protect against water and dust ingress, and they're rated for a ridiculous amount of per-day uses over a particular lifespan of the device. If someone can prevent evidence that aren't better from a technical standpoint, I'll concede. I don't need to worry about it though, because it isn't going to happen. 

I don't particularly mind a notch. My OP6 had a half notch at the top and it didn't make any difference to me. A teardrop notch is certainly better. However, I don't like having a section of screen missing, surrounded by more screen. It's such a step backwards. To say that it isn't noticeable is very subjective. You might not notice it. I can't stop looking at it. 

I play a few games on my phone, but it isn't my primary method of gaming. 

If you're happy with whatever system you have, or with a future device having a punch-hole, that's fine. It's subjective from an aesthetic standpoint. I do believe that if more manufacturers implemented it correctly, i.e they didn't forget users to swipe to access face unlock, then it would catch on very quickly. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be an avenue that's being pursued by the big names, whether that's down to cost, of because Samsung can't handle another manufacturer making a better phone, I don't know. It's all down to Apple and Samsung though. If they adopt something, everyone else will follow. If they don't adopt something, it becomes a niche. Samsung are also set in their way. Look at Bixby. I don't know a single person who uses, or even likes, that feature. Most people I know disable it or remap the Bixby button to something actually useful. Why should Samsung focus on decent camera technology that doesn't rob users of screen space, when they could continue installing shitty personal assistants on their device?"
Android,fdvcv09,t1_fduuhnm,1578746092.0,"Sorry, I suppose I should have put an '/s'.

Actually, no. My battery never goes below about 25 percent. The only time I ever have to pair a headset is when I get a new phone. Other than that I just take my earbuds from the case and they connect. I only use them for GPS directions when I'm on my motorcycle though, so they rarely get used. 

No, they don't cook breakfast. They make a mean margarita though.

The 3.5mm works. Is it the best solution? No, of course not. But with limited space and power, there's only so much that can be done with a phones audio. Personally, I can live without it. I don't really listen to my phone through earbuds/headphones. If I really want to enjoy music, or whatever else I'm listening to, I go upstairs and do it properly. The general consumer isn't an audiophile and wouldn't be interested in paying extra for a phone with a decent DAC over features like a bigger battery or a better camera. 

The audio from a 3.5mm, generally, is acceptable to the vast majority of listeners. It just isn't outstanding."
Android,fds6qj2,t1_fdrzdym,1578695605.0,"Right? I'm not going to lie and say that I don't enjoy the 'gimmicky' aspect of having a camera pop up. Not a single regular phone user that I know even knew that the technology existed and didn't even notice the camera popping up at first. 

I had planned on holding onto my 6 until the 8 was released, but when I saw the leaks I let that dream die. OnePlus really nailed it with the 7 Pro. My only real complaint is the curved edge screen, but I can live with it. I refuse to have a hole-punch camera though. 

The concept looks good, but I'm not so fond of the leather (or whatever it is) but it's probably easier to hold than the 7 Pro. Holding the 7 Pro is like trying to keep a hold of Flubber. The electrochromic glass is a nice feature, but if it's something that ramps the price of the phone up then it isn't worth it to me."
Android,fds6am8,t1_fdrfnu0,1578695320.0,You mean the audio technology that is still found on almost every device capable of outputting audio? AFAIK there are only phone manufacturers actively removing the 3.5mm between generations of device.
Android,fds5s34,t1_fds12jc,1578694986.0,"Exactly. Even if the lifespan of the mechanism is 2 years, to me personally it doesn't matter because I won't keep the phone 2 years. And even if I did, I'm pretty sure I could survive without a front facing camera. 

My OP6 was 16 months old, and the battery was on its way out and the screen had burn in. I'm willing to bet that the motorized camera on my 7 Pro will last longer than 16 months based on the tests that OnePlus performs."

Android,fds5d8e,t1_fdrubj3,1578694722.0,"I'm well aware that I'm not a representation of the whole market. It's just my opinion.

I guarantee that if a larger manufacturers started pumping out phone with a motorized front camera, it would catch on very quickly. It's still too much of a niche technology, and most people haven't had a chance to use it."
Android,fds56gu,t1_fdrmib1,1578694601.0,"Exactly!

Android,fds52zk,t1_fdrjaba,1578694539.0,"How is it not a good solution? As far as I'm concerned, it's the best solution that we have at the moment."
Android,fdr720l,t3_emtdtk,1578680360.0,"I do find the idea of under-display camera technology interesting, but I don't see why manufacturers haven't adopted the motorized pop-up camera more. 

The deciding factor between me sticking with my 7 Pro or buying the 8 Pro rests solely on whether or not the 8 Pro will have a punch-hole camera. It's an absolute deal breaker that I won't compromise on. O can live with no headphone jack and things like a lack of expandable storage. What I can't live with, though, is a small portion of my screen missing. I bought a Note 10+ on release, after vowing not to use Samsung again years ago. On fairness to Samsung, and as much as it pains me to say it, it was a fantastic phone. Great specs, great screen, stylus, amazing camera, and great battery life, but the front camera system forced me to get rid of it. 

For now, the motorized camera seems to be the only sensible option, except for a regular notch. I can't personally speak to the longevity of the motorized camera, but if OnePlus' tests are to be believed, as well as reviewers and friends anecdotal evidence, then there is no reason not to use it. 

My 7 Pro is truly a flagship phone, which I think is a first for OnePlus. I know they have always been seen as the flagship killer brand, but they've always lacked somewhere. My 3T was great, but the screen sucked. My 6 was great, but the screen still sucked, and even with the Gcam mod, the camera was pretty crappy. My 7 Pro ticks all the boxes. Great battery, 90hz, amazing screen that's actually bright and vibrant enough to use in direct sunlight, and, most importantly, I'm not missing *any* screen space. If this same phone had a hole-punch, it would be relegated to a mid-range phone for me, regardless of the hardware specs. The only upgrade now could be the under-screen camera system, but it isn't a necessity. I think the electrochromic glass feature is more of an aesthetic gimmick, and has no significant impact (except, perhaps, for bright light conditions as shown in MKBHD's video) on the actual performance of the phone or camera. The 120hz screen is nice, but I don't know if it will be worth the added hit on the battery life (especially with a 4k screen) over the current 90hz screen, which, for now, seems like a high enough refresh rate. Probably not a popular opinion, though."

A modular power supply allows you to pick and choose which cables you want/need to use in your system. So rather than having a load of SATA power cables that you don't need, you can just connect as many as you do need. 

There are also semi modular power supplies which have the ATX (20/24 pin, the big connector) fixed with the other cables being optional.
