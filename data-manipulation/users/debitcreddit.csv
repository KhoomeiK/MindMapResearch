fightporn,ffswjb2,t1_ffsjnh6,1580195359.0,"It looks like dropped douchebag didn’t realize that his opponent switched mid fight (head was down).  Seems like he was trying to end it peacefully by throwing guy off him and to the ground, only to have his original aggro opponent sucker punch him once he had a chance.  Really unfortunate turn of events for him."
OldSchoolCool,fff3k36,t1_fff201s,1579874760.0,"Pepsi is very uncool in LA.  See, there’s this gang war happening on the streets that are represented by the colors blue and red.  Since Pepsi contains both colors, they are uncool because they are trying too hard to please people.  Coca Cola at least is more definitive in their allegiance so they are the obvious choice for people.  Hope this helps."

Unfortunately for those,  you don’t have much of an appetite if you’re that zonked out.   My boy finished a burger and chowing down on fries.  Things smell fishy and don’t add up.
