thebachelor,ffngnbj,t3_eu9pxk,1580065706.0,"I watch it because... it’s junk food for my soul. I know it’s heavily edited. I know it’s flawed and it’s catty and racially biased and very flawed in so many ways. But, for two hours a week I get to turn my brain to mush. And sometimes I just need that, you know? 
I don’t follow contestants on Instagram or do any of that other stuff. I love the current season gossip, but they quickly cease to exist to me. 
I don’t know if that’s watching it ironically or exactly as it’s intended to be watched, but that’s my truth. It makes me dumb and I petty and I love it."
Youniqueamua,ffnaaza,t3_eua1it,1580063631.0,This looks like a reverse add. Like a warning. Like a thing you see that makes you never want to purchase that product. Put it on cigarettes!

aww,ffn631b,t1_ffkoqhp,1580062423.0,I’ve heard crows bring gifts. Even some of the American ones. So I’m looking for more of a generous bird. No offence to your fat pecker or whatever.

aww,ffipshz,t1_ffhm8z9,1579979693.0,"Hmmmm...  I’m looking for a more beneficial relationship. I already have a dog, and a husband so I don’t need someone to just stare at me a lot while I do everything around the house. But I’ve heard crows bring you gifts, shiny things. I’ve also heard if you get the wrong crow, probably from Seattle or whatever, they’ll vandalize you’re garden and never give you anything. So maybe English birds just aren’t gift-givers. Not a commentary on the country. Maybe Canadian birds are more generous or ill start trying to try the raccoon that lives under the porch. We have free rabies shots, so what could go wrong?"
AnimalsBeingBros,ffioyzx,t1_ffibsjw,1579979117.0,Oooh... Toronto? Vancouver? I’m more of a suburban crow girl. But maybe that’s where she went wrong.

This manifests for me as, I actually want to be a life coach/ therapist. I am very emotional, sensitive. I love talking to people and hearing about how they’re feeling. 
The cancer energy is right there on the surface, and once I really worked through my own emotions (there were A LOT) it really showed me what my passion was... feelings. I just have so many feelings! lol"
