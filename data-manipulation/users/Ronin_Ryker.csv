AskReddit,ffjsyb6,t1_ffjrp3z,1580006094.0,"Eh, I don’t think that’s it necessarily. I do think I may need to be an adult and communicate that I would like to be invited to stuff too, and not be the only one to make plans.

Normally communication, or lack there of, tends to be the problem."
AskReddit,ffjq1tb,t1_ffjpsrl,1580004059.0,"Yeah, I know. That’s why it mostly doesn’t bother me. It’d just be nice to know they think of me and are considerate enough to invite me. But you’re right, I won’t stop inviting them because we do have lots of fun."
AskReddit,ffjms3i,t1_ffjlobp,1580001857.0,"Generally my problem is that I’m the only one that invites anyone ever. Like, sure I get to hangout with friends but it seems like I’m the only one that cares about maintaining the friendship.

It’d be nice to have someone invite me for once. But at the same time, I can’t really blame them either since my friends are a lot like me. Introverted, and likes lots of time to themselves."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffi3f6c,t1_ffhxtk0,1579963944.0,"I feel that, it sucks not having people help you with events like this. However, I’m not all that opposed to cheating so I’ve been able to clear the siege at least once. It’s fun."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffhcnfy,t3_etiskl,1579930007.0,"Thankfully I just play with me, myself, and I. Even if it would be fun to farm Kulve Taroth W/ friends since I missed the first event."
Showerthoughts,ffhcikc,t1_ffhanow,1579929873.0,"I am 85% certain that they too were making a (bad) joke. Basically: You pointed out a flaw in reasoning, thus the obviously only solution is to go nuclear and block you and have everyone else block you for disagreeing with them. The joke is the overreacting, since there is a phenomena on Reddit to go nuclear."
DnD,ffgbzyg,t3_et9udh,1579902888.0,"In one of my one shots one of my players gifted a saber from a goblin boss they had defeated to some goblins they had bribed into acting as meat shields for traps after the wizard trapped them, and had the goblin evolved into a Goblin Boss.  


I agree with you 100%!"
HadesTheGame,fff3m3l,t1_fff3flh,1579874802.0,"Exactly! Personally, I think Dad had something to do with Tisiphone thinking Zag's a murderer."
HadesTheGame,fff2lkv,t1_ffemylh,1579874006.0,"Ehh, that's a REALLY loose definition of murder there. I understand what you mean, but at the same time it's complete bollocks. a child had no choice in the matter of being birthed, and if Tisiphone views THAT as murder, that's on her. Death of the mother during birth does not make the child a murderer."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffeuae6,t1_ffec008,1579865830.0,"So, did she just not want to take it or what? I’m just kinda confused why neither of you tried to thwart it, as you say."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffe34vm,t1_ffcnx76,1579835466.0,"Query: Did she use Plan B /The Morning After Pill? Or did you both just think “eh, it was a small amount she probably won’t get pregnant”?"
gifs,ffbdgzw,t3_erunww,1579760686.0,"I... don’t even know how this is happening. How are they moving?! I assume there is a LOT more of her reaching out to change/adjust/move lego pieces, right?

This is amazing, btw! I remember watching HUGE amounts of lego stop-motion years ago, she has done a great job."
Breath_of_the_Wild,ff5inl7,t1_ff4qhyt,1579594628.0,"Protip: Save just before you encounter a Guardian, and every time you fail a deflect just load the save. That’s how I learned to party from both close up and from like 30 yards away. It’s insane what you can do with good timing."
AskReddit,ff5i7go,t3_ero8mj,1579594032.0,"Hmmm, probably a little bit surprised? Both good and bad.

I have gained weight, unfortunately. However on the flip side, I’ve massively increased my skills at video games and other hobbies. He’d be excited about those.

He’d probably be happy to know I’ve had a few relationships, and that I’m not completely incompetent when it comes to the ladies.

He’d be STOKED to know I DMed with some friends. D&D has been a dream for a long while, so that’s definitely a huge plus. 

He’d be sad but unsurprised that I still don’t know what I want to do with myself in regards to careers. Still as aimless as I was back then. 

Oh, he’d be devastated to learn that my grandmother would pass in two years for him. Breast cancer, for those curious. It sucks, Fuck Cancer."

StellarisMods,fejyv0h,t1_fejmtdf,1579188964.0,"Heya! Thanks for your response, I appreciate it.

As for the mod that you linked, that's exactly what I ended up using to increase trait picks. The code and file that you mentioned in the first block is located in ""D:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Stellaris\\common\\species\_archetypes\\00\_species\_archetypes.txt""

The mod changes that file to whatever we want it to be, and that's what I ended up doing. It is unfortunately not possible to put into a trait, but the work around is fine."

However, if people are in the middle of a crowd, what do other people see? Do our clothes just disappear? Or do they see us taking them off? Are the clothes nearby?

If I was talking with someone and then their clothes just poof away, I’d be a little more understanding than seeing them strip in front of me."

I watched this twice, the clicked away from it to go look at something else. But then came back to watch a third time JUST because of how well made and cool this is. Honestly amazing."

Why do people still get them? They don’t (or rarely) help you get a job in the field, and apparently don’t increase your income that much either.

Is it personal reasons? Like, they really love that field and want to learn more for the sake of it?  Or are people still thinking masters are worth it in regards to job opportunities and pay?"
6Perks,fdjar06,t3_ekxaha,1578463520.0,"Probably Kesi, tbh. Out of them all she’s the one with the least bad downside. Having and knowing someone with lots of life experience under her belt would be a huge boon to finding someone I want to be with.

Finish all Heart-to-Hearts. (I managed to finish Lao's, but since his are missable I don't include him)

Do all the quests in the game.

Plus I’m not really a fan of the whole >!Abuse/Sadomasochism thing Hori has going on. Miya seems EXTREMELY uncomfortable with it all.!<

There’s hardly been any character progression either, like they’ll have a fight and they’ll “resolve” it but nothing *really* changes.

-The indention on your chin is a little more pronounced than your sister’s

XenobladeChroniclesX,fckvn1f,t1_fckggsy,1577734171.0,"I personally have swapped the armor on the Mastema and Amdusia, so it wouldn’t be a bad thing to do. It really does give a nice buff to damage.

Also, I was slightly incorrect when I was talking about the Ether Blossom Dance build, go look at u/Grimas_Truth’s comment. He has more info on that.

But the build that you linked is still highly effective, and if you follow it, it will definitely let you destroy basically everything in the game."
XenobladeChroniclesX,fckexmr,t1_fckdhfu,1577723808.0,"The Ether Blossom build is ENTIRELY set up around the traits on gear, and rare traits at that. Getting the specific traits to make Ether Blossom good against Telethia is so time consuming, and entirely reliant on RNG. And I have 0 idea how to fight Pharsis on the ground. I get annihilated, even after giving myself the best gear.

&#x200B;

I would say go for the Skell Zenith Build, as that is 90% just getting reward tickets for the mats to build the Mastema White Reaper, Augments, and the Zenith Cannon. It's the safer bet, but if you want you can farm for gear while the World Bosses are gone."
XenobladeChroniclesX,fcka813,t3_ehmelp,1577720692.0,"Sorry to say man, but Telethia, The Endbringer is an active section of the map. You HAVE to kill it at least once in order to have 100% Map Survey. Wait, no. You have to kill it TWICE. Once during a quest and once for the map completion.

Pharsis, The Ever Queen is technically optional, but I do recommend killing her at least once. If you go for the Zenith Build You can 1 shot her if you aim for her head while she's sleeping.

&#x200B;

But yes, grinding will need to be done if you want to 100% the game without cheating. I personally just ended up cheating all of the mats so I could just craft all of the augments and gave myself the optimal Ether Blossom gear.

Sometimes it felt harder to cheat the stuff than it was to just farm reward tickets, but I did enjoy having all of the besat stuff in the game to mess around with."
