worldnews,fdhiuc5,t1_fdhgai8,1578423564.0,"Last I checked the US had started way more wars than Iran has. I love that the right loves legitimizing North Korea at any chance it can get but refuses to allow Iran to speak. Human rights conditions in North Korea are much worse and on a whole the regime there is worse. Yet they get a summit. 

Saudi Arabia actively sponsors terrorism, so does Israel. So does Russia. Trump meets and hangs out with their leaders. Iran is bad though. So shame on them.

We could have freed Iran by dealing with them diplomatically. The average person there wanted western stuff. Culturally they weren‚Äôt dissimilar than us, but by threatening to blow up their cultural sites, we play right into their hardline government and force their people to ally with the ayatollah. Iran was right and ready for a cultural western revolution and we‚Äôve fucked it the same way we did in the 70ies. We need to leave them the fuck alone."
