Gamingcirclejerk,ffe18fu,t1_ffc6ryi,1579834072.0,It’s been there all along. They played us like a fiddle. EA (who is very bad) has permeated every aspect of our lives
Political_Revolution,ff7fx04,t3_erzkfe,1579648628.0,The most unlikable candidate in history who silenced Bill’s victims is claiming Bernie is unlikable? The irony
trailerparkboys,ff3lj83,t1_ff3kns0,1579543612.0,Jokes on Mr Lahey everyone knows that jail in Canada is a great time
DunderMifflin,ff2wek5,t3_er46q3,1579526689.0,Lmao this fucking sub man. Somebody can literally say they’re starting the show and get 24 thousand upvotes
trailerparkboys,ff2wa11,t1_ff2jlm5,1579526563.0,Nah he was pulling his goalie
trailerparkboys,ff2w938,t1_ff1qrht,1579526536.0,This might be my favorite episode. JROC even though he’s more minor is probably my favorite character
nihilism,feykaxm,t1_feyhjjo,1579446657.0,Exactly. People equate “happiness” and satisfaction with peppiness and what not when in reality I think it’s just being content with your situation
nihilism,feunpxg,t3_eqc6it,1579388322.0,"I am an adopted child. I would say since I was adopted at a very young age with no attachment to my biological parents that parenting is no different as I consider my adoptive parents my true family and respect them as a biological child would their own parents. It's only different if you treat the kid like they aren't yours. So basically, anything you have otherwise read about parenthood is no different here"
nihilism,feunfp0,t1_fepov1d,1579388231.0,"I asked in a previous recent comment if anyone is truly happy. I think this might just be it. Yes, but you must be truly deluded and not know the truth. Not to say nihilists can not be relatively satisfied with their lives, however I wouldn't say your average optimistic nihilist is really one of those super peppy ""everything is great!"" types"
nihilism,feun2g3,t3_eq4zht,1579388094.0,I don't know if anyone is truly happy. Like someone please tell me. Is religion and family or whatever really enough for some people? Or are most full of shit and just acting to push aside their true feelings? I can't really tell my own extreme pessimistic bias ruins my answer.
unpopularopinion,feuhw6l,t3_eqh2c2,1579386675.0,This is not an unpopular opinion holy shit. I swear people on reddit think they’re intellectuals with the world stacked against their “mind blowing” ideas.
ABoringDystopia,fejs4v3,t3_epfp1b,1579184499.0,Metallica didn’t exploit anyone to gain their wealth. It comes from people willing to listen to them

SandersForPresident,fegsco3,t3_eowv5b,1579101412.0,I am genuinely angry about this blatant attempt to smear someone out of the realization they can’t be competed with. Just a reminder to everyone warren is pretty much a corporate democrat and I can almost guarantee you she has about 0 intention of following through with her promises
nin,fe9vzxs,t3_eo6lwz,1578941918.0,I’m considering going to the Cleveland show.  I hope they play the older material though. I think we can acknowledge all of these bands had an artistic peak and have fallen off pretty hard
talkingheads,fe5l7jr,t1_fe333sj,1578870888.0,Either way the point stands
talkingheads,fe2is1k,t3_enhl1o,1578838812.0,"My dude Remain In Light is one of the most properly rated albums ever. Have you ever been on /mu/ or rym? Nothing underrated about it, people love it"
thesmiths,fdwmh52,t1_fdwilcl,1578760229.0,A reminder that Ian Curtis does not exist in the social media era. Impossible to tell if he would have made his views known

Gamingcirclejerk,fdwbf34,t3_en5lii,1578757008.0,"/uj obviously this guy is a total dumbass. However, what is the point of putting those things on the switch? I’m confused as to how that would help"
HaveANiceLife,fdw1wlg,t3_en3n3c,1578754176.0,Just got my copy on transparent blue yesterday. I knew it came with the book but I forgot it did by the time the delivery got here so it was like a nice surprise. I also got a Flenser pin which was pretty cool
thesmiths,fdw1fdw,t3_en7h4l,1578754096.0,The same people who hate Morrissey today would probably also hate Ian Curtis. Pretty hard supporter of the Tory movement. I’m just assuming this is related to Morrissey’s political antics
fantanoforever,fdr9zga,t1_fdqwmgi,1578681567.0,lol you sound equally butt hurt as those people
calvinandhobbes,fdr9sl0,t3_emshr3,1578681518.0,wow you’re really showing us all how woke you are by posting this for the 10th time this week
indieheadscirclejerk,fdqpwcx,t3_emn4g4,1578672330.0,/uj I know it’s just a meme on here but does anyone else think Sufjan is one of the most overrated artists ever? It isn’t bad but I’ve listened to Illinois and C&L a couple times each and I just don’t get it. There’s a few highlights but I don’t see why this guy is such an indie darling
fantanoforever,fdqfkjt,t1_fdnpc5l,1578665400.0,Dumbasses who listen to music exclusively on AirPods be talking about the “production” on Igor just because Anthony said it when it’s literally impossible how well to tell an album is produced on those things. You can tell a Fantano drone by how they describe records and obviously if the only albums they listen to are ones he’s reviewed positively
nihilism,fdpb68t,t3_elzcjn,1578624262.0,Whose comics are these? I like them
fantanoforever,fdog4sh,t3_emcynx,1578604460.0,"A) a reupload of the old video

C) score only changes in an extremely minor fashion or not at all

fantanoforever,fdog0bz,t1_fdo29tj,1578604389.0,Yup
twinpeaks,fdkr0jn,t3_elsvnh,1578509347.0,Way she goes
fantanoforever,fdkhlp5,t3_elu5x0,1578504040.0,Who cares what he thinks about an album that otherwise gets a lot of respect? It honestly is still pretty overrated even though it’s really good. If he re-reviews y’all are gonna be less than happy with the result
nottheonion,fdk2nmd,t3_elhsjm,1578494565.0,Wow! Just like us! Honestly this “high and mighty” shit from him is kind of cringeworthy. It’s genuinely good that he’s doing this but having one tuxedo and it being a fucking news story really shows how out of touch these people are with being a normal person

indieheadscirclejerk,fdermbg,t1_fdefyse,1578345159.0,A 9/10 can still be overrated if people rave about it and call it a 10 and the greatest album ever all the time. That’s pretty much my view. I think it’s really good but good lord some people freak over it way too hard
trailerparkboys,fda5h7b,t3_ekd5t4,1578241946.0,Easily my favorite more minor character
nihilism,fd2z83j,t3_ejxp3p,1578153247.0,A drive to survive such as eating and drinking does not equate to higher meaning.
thesmiths,fd2yu54,t3_ejnv7e,1578153104.0,"Claiming anything to be the ""best ever"" is so clearly a mark of opinion it's unbelievable anyone thinks they have the authority to make that claim. ""Hands down""? Seriously, the Smiths are popular music. Marr is a great guitarist and Morrissey a great lyricist but both have people you could name in front of them. I really like the Smiths but this is meaningless fanboying."

TheRightCantMeme,fcsmytk,t3_eifcxz,1577920027.0,"Nobody thinks that people shouldn’t work. However, if you’re working 40 hours a week you should be able to at least get by. It doesn’t need to be the most luxurious living in the world, the rich would still be pretty rich under a lot of these plans, candidates like Bernie or congresspeople like AOC just want to make sure those towards the bottom can live comfortably rather than scraping by when we live in the wealthiest nation on the planet"
Cringetopia,fcr5kug,t3_eii9v5,1577897108.0,I’m a first year in college but I’ve worked at the same grocery store for over 3 years since I was in high school. I’ve recently started friending some of the people there on Facebook and my god they all post shit like this.

neworder,fcqwqu2,t3_eifb2j,1577893386.0,How much did getting your hands on a copy run you? I’d probably  pay like $40-$50 for it but all I see is well over $100
radiohead,fcn1b1h,t3_ehsulw,1577800393.0,I complained about this in the comments a while back and got downvoted. YES. It’s so annoying. Lots of people on here have the releases on vinyl nobody thinks yours is interesting

vinyljerk,fc7flhe,t1_fc6cqxt,1577505950.0,"Think about it for a second. Smaller artists with a dedicated fan base tend to oversee what they put out with care. Where a pop artist might have less control and their management just says “yeah we gotta put out some vinyl because it sells now”. The music doesn’t have to be bad, but certain artists take a lot better care of it"
vinyljerk,fc5nm3c,t1_fc5m3ct,1577462163.0,Probably just one bad copy then or something. Or this dumbass is playing it on a Crosley lol. I wouldn’t know I didn’t buy it
