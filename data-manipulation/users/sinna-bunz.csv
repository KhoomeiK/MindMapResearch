AskWomen,ffbtfpu,t3_esod02,1579782104.0,"Absolutely nothing compared to others stories in here and mine is super benign BUT the doctor asked me if I was cool with having residents (should have listened to the plural part of that) observing since they were doing rotations. I also work in healthcare so I was like, I get it. Not everyone is comfortable giving consent to multiple eyes that aren't their doctor. Plus, if any of them wanted to truly become gynos, they need experience. And it's just a vagina, I'm sure they've all seen and/or have one.

S E V E N RESIDENTS CAME IN TO OBSERVE. I was like ""well, should have done some grooming but ok""."
AmItheAsshole,ff8xah1,t3_es5wir,1579699099.0,"ESH. Your sister is misinformed, but you're also way out of line. I have severe food allergies and mild food allergies that are regularly being discovered. I now have panic-induced hives when I THINK I've eaten something I am allergic to. The hives are psychosomatic, but it doesn't make them suddenly not hives or make them go away if I KNOW I didn't eat an allergen.

She may truly believe that she is allergic to gluten so much so that her body reacted as if she were having a reaction with a stomach ache and cramps due to nerves. On top of that, reintroducing foods that her body is unused to digesting can also cause stomach aches and cramps because the bacteria that digests those foods no longer exists in sufficient quantities.

Don't fuck with people's food, regardless of whether or not you think they're lying."

AskCulinary,femq1rx,t1_fel5st5,1579266228.0,">Or even worse, the restaurants have authentic food and people complain about it.

Yes! I went to an authentic restaurant (I can't recall which cuisine unfortunately and don't want to misidentify) and it was overwhelmingly spicy and I didn't like it. It isn't the restaurants fault for not knowing how mayo of a white person I am and it's not my fault for not knowing how spicy/that I wouldn't like it. The restaurant was good, the service was nice, they checked in on us several times, all in all a good experience. It's okay to not like food, not be used to a certain style of food, etc. and I'm sure the food would be good to someone who has the taste for it. I just don't, and that's okay!"
