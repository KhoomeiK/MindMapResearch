I wish people are more financially literate. The principal portion of your mortgage payment shouldn't be calculated as part of your carrying costs. It's money put towards your equity.

In a healthy market, real estate investments should expect to have a negative cashflow if you're leveraged with a mortgage. Your rental income should cover the costs, and your profit should cover a portion of your mortgage principal. If your profit covers 100% of your mortgage principal and then some (i.e., positive cashflow), then the property is actually underpriced relative to the demand for rent."
