So we end up doing HALF the FP's we make and adding more while we're there. Maybe even adding a same day ADR just to make sure it's not booked and go eat there.

We save money by finding discounts and staying at Pop, or simply not going. We've yet felt like we had to rent DVC points or stay off site, but that may be in our future. Prices have sharply increased which is really turning me OFF of Disney, not making me want to PREPAY for my next 30 years + yearly maintenance. The biggest downside is the thought of stressing out having to book 11 months in advance, fighting for hard to get 9pt rooms, and not having the flexible cancellations. For example my whole year is booked, 15+ nights total, albeit Pop, but no one is discounting Deluxes that much this year. We thought we'd save some money. If I were DVC, I'd probably only get 5 nights at a DVC villa, and the other 3 vacations would be Pop anyway paying cash."
