I haven't finished this one, but all viewpoints are saying that a guilty verdict means a crushing blow to Starfleet's reputation and even the integrity of Earth's role in the Federation.

DaystromInstitute,fdpxx51,t1_fdp7ay5,1578645241.0,"In all but Spock and Nero's case, the villains weren't out to summarily wreck history. 

In Future's End - Due to Braxton's initial interference, a split occurs in the 20th century that culminates in another version of Braxton rescuing Voyager and never experiencing the events of the two-parter. The impact of Starling's use of the Aeon seems to be limited to the episode itself and doesn't interfere in future temporal events that would undo the past. 

In Time's Arrow, the Devidians are killing poor, weak people who already had little to contribute to society. Given that Data's head was already in the cavern, those people had already died and we're part of our timeline. The presence of Picard and Crew, as well as Twain's journey to the future and Guinan's safety were virtually preordained.

In Star Trek 2009 - Nero destroys Vulcan basically as soon as Spock shows up. Vulcan played a pivotal role in harboring Kirk and Crew after the events of the Search for Spock and served as the launching point for Kirk's return to earth aboard the Bounty. Not only that, but Admiral Marcus says Nero's attack caused Starfleet to search the galaxy for aggressive threats, coming into contact with Khan almost a decade sooner and severely altering his story. Wrath of Khan doesn't happen in 2285, Spock doesn't die. No Genesis planet burial site. No fal-tor-pan. And that impacts how and when they address the whale probe. If they can't address the whale probe crisis the same way, that changes the events in San Francisco 1986. The ripples of change from 1986 have to *already have happened* by the time Nero's ship emerges in 2233. Given these points, we have a direct line of events from Nero's incursion to the unraveling of the events of TWOK, TSFS, and TVH, culminating to changes within the past of the Kelvin timeline that will be present upon Nero's arrival. And that's just one past event that is screwed up. 

The Kelvin-verse doesn't endure a Klingon War in 2255.  Where is Michael Burnham and her mother? Are they living happily because Section 31 didn't pursue Icarus in this timeline? If so, Kelvin-Spock won't have the benefit of time travel knowledge that Prime Spock did. If that is the case, then the Enterprise's missions (while already different) won't include Tomorrow is Yesterday or Assignment: Earth, thus putting two more pins in the map of history that play out differently in the Kelvin-verse. 

Maybe if Gary Seven hadn't crossed paths with Kirk, his missions on Earth would have had a greater impact, allowing for the updated tech present by 2233 on Kelvin."
DaystromInstitute,fdovrdk,t3_emdydk,1578613986.0,"I'll venture to extrapolate on your speculation by adding the History of the Future.

Spock uses what he knew and learned about time travel over those 130+ years to make sure that, when he goes back in time to prepare Romulus for Hobus in the Kelvin timeline, he preserves his own timeline. After all, no need to cause a paradox by derailing his own past. He carefully calculates a point in time that his arrival will have minimal affect - the entry point we see in *Star Trek* (2009). He couldn't factor in Nero's intrusion, so that will not be a part of the rest of this writing.

Spock has to make absolutely certain that he can derail the history of this new timeline be *ensuring that it is a completely independent timeline*, that is, by the time he arrives, the *past* of that universe is sufficiently different than the past of his own universe. If the past is different, then the future will be different, and there won't be a 'branching' moment, so to speak.

How is he certain that he can do this? He knows what his entry point in time is, and what his personal plan is. His plan will impact the *future* of this universe, such that *future* time travel events to the *past* either do not occur, or occur differently.

Examples of interventions Spock could stage before his death that Starfleet could act on:
1. V'Ger. Provide the codes needed to get V'Ger to chill out and not be threat. (Non-time travel)
2. The Whale Probe: Launch a project to either reinvigorate the Humpback whale species and learn their language, so when the Probe shows up, the Whales can say ""Hey, yeah, we went extinct but some people brought us back. We're good."" instead of whatever they told the probe in the prime timeling. This means Kirk and Co don't go back to San Francisco (sorry Gillian, George, Gracey, and Baby Whale). 
Edit addition: 
3. City on the Edge of Forever: Spock provides notes for Starfleet to quarantine the Gaudrian's system long before Bones heads back. Keeler still dies, just without the intervention of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. The Guardian can become a carefully studied tool a little earlier than it was in his time. (Conversely, a mission to ensure Keeler dies could have been launched, another predestination paradox).

In the Kelvin timeline, enough time travel events about which Spock was aware were changed to completely decouple it from his primary timeline. No branching needed. 

Now, eventually, investigators in the wake of Hobus discover evidence of a top-level classified event: The use of time travel similar to that which has been locked down by Starfleet since the 2250s. Not only that, but as time goes on, more sophisticated investigations reveal exactly where and when Spock went, and the knowledge of his calculations leads to the invention of technologies that can extrapolate the impact on timelines given certain conditions - just like we see on Relativity in the 29th century (and something Annorax was well aware of in the 2170s).

With this technology in the hands of Starfleet's temporal investigations division (which has grown substantially since the days of Dulmer and Lucsly), there might just be someone, somewhere, available to send Discovery back when they arrive."

DaystromInstitute,fcsrqys,t1_fcqwa4y,1577923443.0,"Using the commbadge as a proximity fob might be the first in a two-step authentication system. A tactile verification (finger prints or surface DNA scan) could be the second step. The officer sits at the helm and touches the console, getting authenticated on the fly. A third step could be duty shifts. When the section chiefs provide the department heads with their duty rosters, they get approved. The approval automatically registers those shifts into the authentication system. 

**Example A: All approvals are in order.**  
Ensign Smith is scheduled to be in Astrometrics to continue research at 0800. They arrive in astrometrics and assume their station, which unlocks based on presence of their communicator, on-board DNA-scan. Those two checks verify against the approved duty shift entered by Smith's superior officer. 

**Example B: An approved shift replacement**  
Ensign Smith is scheduled to be in Astrometrics to continue research at 0800. Due to an illness, Ensign Jones arrives in astrometrics and assume Smith's station.  The station logs the presence of Jones' commbadge and on-board DNA scan and checks against the duty roster. Their superior has forgotten to update the shift, and the console asks Jones for his personal authentication code. Since Jones has the authority to access and conduct research at this level, the console unlocks. A memo is sent to the superior officer noting the discrepancy in the duty roster, and the supervisor corrects the issue.

**Example C: An unapproved shift replacement**  
Ensign Smith is scheduled to be in Astrometrics to continue research at 0800. Due to an illness, Ensign Jones arrives in astrometrics and assume Smith's station.  The station logs the presence of Jones' commbadge and on-board DNA scan and checks against the duty roster. Their superior has forgotten to update the shift, and the console asks Jones for his personal authentication code. Ensign Jones does not have the authority to access and conduct research at this level, so the console remains locked. A memo is sent to the superior officer noting the discrepancy in the duty roster, and the supervisor contacts Jones to get an explanation.

Only someone who is *above* that officer or crewman in the chain of command can assume that console or interface without an approval code.

So, potentially 3-step automatic authentication, with approval codes as a back-up in the event that the 3-step invalidates for any reason. Depending on the chain of command, fewer authentications are necessary.
