todayilearned,ffxhbfv,t1_ffx23ug,1580325146.0,"This is a delicate issue, but it was really blown out of proportions. Here's what happened: 

Seeing himself in the mirror, Alex asked ""what color?"". Then he was told ""grey"" 6 times. He repeated the word ""grey"". That's it.

There are lots of issues there: did Alex even realize it was his own reflection, or was he asking what color the mirror was? And if he did realize it was his reflection, is there really a cognitive difference between asking about his own color vs. the color of another item he could see in the mirror? 

Therefore, I really don't think that qualifies as an existential question because we cannot be sure the question was asked trying to get a better understanding of himself."

If you were employed at Disneyland from 2010 to 2019, but were on sick leave from 2014 to 2016, you should still write : Disneyland, costume character - 2010 to 2019 on your resume.

GameDeals,ffmcu53,t1_fflphoo,1580052550.0,"Well, usually stealth means spending the whole game crouching
 with a limited point of view and moving terribly slowly, spending your time hidden behind a box or something while you hope you won't be discovered by a single guard because even a single enemy would be stronger than you in regular combat.

None of this is true in Dishonored. Your character has insane mobility, and can keep teleporting in every direction (in D2 you choose between two characters and the other has a different mobility tool, haven't played it yet though), which allows you to reach rooftops, rafters and whatnot pretty easily. The levels have a verticality to them that, added to the amazing level design, means that you always have several paths and approaches to your objective. Lastly, the game (at least the first and I think that mechanic was kept in the sequel) rewards you for not killing too many people. And really, most of your encounters are with people who are doing their job, not ruthless murderers. However, it is pretty clear that your powers would allow you to go on a murdering spree if you wanted to. You're the hunter, they're the prey. 

So yeah, Dishonored is the franchise that I really recommend to people who don't usually like stealth games."

That's not what u/scooterdog says. It doesn't matter that it's useful to us, it pays for them and that's it. Maybe you bought a toilet seat cover and won't need another one in the foreseeable future, but there is still a Chinese company that sells toilet seat covers on Amazon, and that company paid Amazon to send ads to people who bought a related product. That's it. It doesn't matter to Amazon if the ad was relevant to your current needs, they still got more money from that Chinese manufacturer than the razor thin margin they'd have got by giving you a non-paid recommendation, say for a toilet paper holder, even if you actually need that product.

Maybe those that purchase these internal ads are just wasting money, but also maybe that out of all the people that bought a toilet seat cover, there'll be enough small contractors who actually purchase that kind of product often, or people who are doing renovations and will actually purchase one or two additional seat covers for their other toilets, or people who regret their initial purchase as it's not the right size and will return and get another seat cover, and at the end of the day this kind of internal ad pays."

Patience to learn how the combat system works (turn-based or pausable combat is pretty frequent in the genre, which helps), patience to read dialogues/documents/log entries, and patience to endure what is usually a rough start until you get more powerful.

Now you should tell us which ones you played, and how it went. RPG is a very broad genre, from arpg's (Diablo-likes) to jrpg's (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest). There are also first person rpg's for example those developped by Bethesda (Fallout, Elder Scrolls). 

The easiest to get into are the Diablo-likes. Diablo 3 was really improved from its rocky release, the main thing people dislike about it is that it's more casual than Diablo 2. Which could be fine for you.

- The Witcher 3 took me 120 hours to beat, which is the time it took to complete tue main quest, side quests, and contracts. Didn't 100% it.

- Skyrim is a game that can be as long as you want it to be. Some players have been playing it often since its original release, like I said it's mostly because of mods. Without them, it still has one huge-ass map that'll keel you busy for a hundred of hours or two, if you want to explore it decently. It's rewarding to do so, and pretty fun. If your thing is to focus on the main quest though, it'll take you 20-30 hours tops.

- The Bioshock games will take you 15-20 hours each, unless you choose to 100% them (which will require multiple playthroughs). The maps are large for a fps/adventure game, and reward exploration, but aren't nearly as vast as the open worlds of the other games you mentionned."
