videos,fea536t,t1_fe9blvh,1578944460.0,"Let's get really real for a second. Censorship is bad, even for insanely stupid stuff. We should stop trying to propagate a world where we censor or ignore the stuff that offends us and try to create a place with open dialogue, education, and finally acceptance. The last one is key and seems to have been forgotten. If you've tried to convince someone that their view is wrong and you've tried educating them, it's time to accept it instead of getting angry, bitter, or writing them off. If you have a friend that genuinely thinks the Earth is flat, try to bring them around. But if they won't budge, there's no need to expurgate them from your life, just accept them for their flaws and be a good friend. Maybe don't let them teach your kids science though."

I couldn't be happier if that were true, but it does fly in the face of what I've been taught. That's why I was so eager to ask you and a local because I know my perspective is naturally skewed. Again, if I get what you're saying; then that's terrific!"

Is it as rampant as the West makes it out to be? Have people in the West confronted you or your family for supporting it by living there? Is it a talked about social issue there or is it largely ignored? Thank you"
