But unless he has a history of violent crime, I'd consider whether or not his constant manipulation of you to think he's more dangerous than he is might be playing into your mind.

It's easier to tell yourself some people, especially you, cannot be saved rather than face the truth that anyone with any past can choose to be redeemed.

It might even be the case that you tell yourself you are evil because saying you are evil means you don't have to face the pain of acknowledging you were a victim.

Your desire to kill yourself and your justification for doing it is a flimsy sham. Everyone with sense can see that. Even if you did kill yourself, you'd be in pain so much longer than you'd need to be if you just stopped hiding."
mentalhealth,ff9xljw,t1_ff9wg5z,1579723704.0,"Fair enough - so if you have read the book I can ask you a much more topic-specific question.

As I'm sure you know, the fundamental purpose of mindfulness is to practice the technique of observing your thoughts and letting them pass, which prevents one negative thought leading to another. Usually the first mindfulness technique you learn is the one minute meditation which lets you stop, get into that mindful state and stop a cascade of negative of emotions by letting the thoughts appear and ""pop"".

For me, this works. Since learning the technique (and the others in the book) I haven't had spirals of rumination.

Does your book not contain this technique? Or if it does, what happens when you try to apply it? Does it simply ""not work""? I struggle to see how can you can be actively applying this knowledge when the first thing in mindfulness training should at-least alleviate your problem. If the very first thing wasn't working for me I'd have given up, yet you seem to persist despite the fact it isn't preventing the rumination, which is really the only thing mindfulness exists for.

The oddly static nature of the resources in this game make me suspect this approach; there are infinite instances but the instances seem resource constrained to one size.

The gold standard is not virtual servers but containerized game services, with each ""server"" being not one virtual machine but a series of containerized apps with some form of resource manager checking the resources each container is using and deploying a new one when it becomes taxed. These containers are generally single-threaded micro services. That would let a server ""render more animals"" specifically, as there would be an ""animal service"".

In Max Payne, you can still guarantee enough computational resources to manage slow-mo (slow-motion might actually DECREASE the computational resources required), but in RDO a player can look out onto a vista that covers an entire content. Once again, you end up in a situation where you'd potentially be rendering tens or hundreds of thousands of animals for a 25-player server. There's simply no guarantee any game server would be able to handle that.

When you're designing for the cloud, you have to work on guarantees. Having boxes of power x to host game instances, and guaranteeing that power x is more than the single-player amount of animals, is one way. 

A much more pragmatic way is to simply have the instances spawn things until spawning one more thing taxes the system, then have the server software throttle more spawns until it can perform the operation within an acceptable response time. Both of these ensure you don't exceed the resources available which would cause the server to crash.

Rockstar has to stick to an approach that ensures the server doesn't crash. Unfortunately, in a game like this there is no real way to do this. The only feasible mechanism to provide a single-player like experience would be to adopt what games like Dark Souls did and have the client actually do the computation, but this immediately makes your game a million times more ""hackable"", and it's something you'd almost certainly have to architecture for at launch.

People don't tell me things will get better because my answer is always the same; they will if I choose to. 

I kicked all the drugs (which includes the antidepressants), stopped lying to myself that I was ""working"" on my depression and actually worked on it (I read books, many books, with the free time), and right now I'm interviewing for jobs that pay way less than what I was on before but which represent places I actually want to work for and things I may care about.

I wonder when the last time you read some books designed to help you find new ways of thinking about your illness was? If the answer is ""never"" or ""a long time ago"" you may want to look at what your goal is, because ""getting better"" is either not your true goal, or you have a contradictory goal that requires you to continue being sick. 

I've made the recommendation here a few times, but the book that helped me most was ""The Courage to be Disliked"", which is a book on the philosophy of a psychological theory called Individual Psychology that inverts a lot of how Western medicine usually thinks about psychological illness, and which I found was particularly relevant to my own form of depression. It might be a good place to start.

If you're still using any mind-altering substances (weed included), you'll want to get off them. All of them - there is no recovery whilst you are taking any mind-altering substance. You can't recover a normal level of mental functioning whilst you are making your mind behave abnormally. 

Things will get better if you make them. And a good first step is to at-least admit to yourself where you are telling yourself lies even you don't believe. I suspect for you ""I'm smoking weed to cope"" is at-least one of them."

Hey well done, you are exactly correct! Most people never figure that out; they think the abuser is actually confused, and often start talking about his childhood as though that somehow explains his obvious current goal of ""control with negative emotions"". 

&#x200B;

>  For some reason I basically begged him. 

Same thing. He was trying to control you with negative emotions when he kept changing his story on the room. You didn't fall for that, but then he managed to pull the same stunt on you right after by controlling you with guilt. He was lying as much when he blamed you for everything as he was when he pretended he wanted you to stay, then immediately changed his story to make it seem he was throwing you away.

Every second of every interaction you ever have with this guy will be him trying to exert control over you, one way or another. Clearly his main weapon is guilt, shame and negative emotions. He chooses to do this - it's a specific mechanism of control he employs against specific people.

&#x200B;

> I honestly want to die. I know that's dumb but I've done everything he's wanted and i'm still tossed away. 

He didn't want what he said. It's exactly the same as the two situations I just spoke about; both the list of things to do, and the subsequent rejection of your efforts, are just two more ways of trying to attain control over you.

He hasn't tossed you away - he's pretended to toss you away to make you feel worthless, so you can be controlled. He didn't have a list of things you needed to do - he pretended he had a list of things to do to make you feel guilty, so you could be controlled.

This person has no mechanism of interacting with the world except finding any way to create guilt, shame and a host of other negative emotions to break you and make it so you can be controlled. 

You'll be taken back. And guess what? You'll be taken back so you can be made to feel like you ""dodged a bullet"" so.....you can be controlled.

There is nothing else in this man. There never was and there never will be. He isn't broken - he is choosing to do this. He cannot be ""fixed"" because there is nothing wrong with him - he is simply evil, and the only goal he has in his evil life is to control his partners with emotional abuse."
RedDeadOnline,ff6bzqf,t1_ff6bgb9,1579623877.0,"No it's not possible, unfortunately as soon as you get into multiplayer there are concerns pertaining to cloud-based resources that have to be considered.

On single player, you can spawn animals in a 50 meter or so radius around the player and guarantee the host device will be able to support it. Online, you now have the same world but 20+ players, and if you want to provide a ""single player experience"" to all 20 there's now no guarantee the hosting infrastructure can support the potentially hundreds of thousands of animals or NPCs or interactions with the environment this might involve.

Rockstar go for the lowest common denominator way of solving this problem; take single player, and basically divide the online content by the number of players and host the game instances on a device with roughly equivalent processing power to the machine required to run singleplayer. Now everyone has about 1/25ish of the offline experience if all the players are spread out.

It solves the problem, but something that automatically scales (which you may know about in terms of containerized services and cloud provides like AWS and Azure) would in-theory of let something like single-player happen. 

Sadly, it's bleedingly obvious from the state of the game now and the things they fix in patches that  such a thing is simply not on the cards for RDO. And, to be fair to Rockstar, this is the mostly-free add-on to a singleplayer game, and it's bloody impressive RDR2 and GTA even have barely-working online equivalents."
domesticviolence,ff6bik6,t3_erwpis,1579623571.0,"Your friend is choosing to stay. Instead of worrying about him (the abuser's motivations are obvious; they've learned that bullying and dominating their partner lets them avoid their feelings of inferiority), you need to ask yourself ""why is she letting this happen?"".

She will be afraid to tell you her reason for staying. If her only objective was ""to leave"" she could sneak out in the dead of night, or she could have taken the police up on their offer to escort her to her mother's. She's choosing to stay, which means one of her objectives is still ""make the relationship work"". 

You cannot reason with him or change him, but you can reason with her. The problem is she'll be speaking to you as though her only goal is ""get away"", because this lets her extract emotional support from you, but the fact she has another goal that is causing her to stay with him needs to be are the forefront of your mind. There's a chance she barely realises she has this second goal, and there's a chance that merely realising she has it will be enough to make her realise it's toxic and will keep her in an abusive situation.

When people have a goal they admit to themselves, and a goal they do not, their language is invariably laced with references to the thing they are not saying. She will have told you, innumerable times, what goal she has that is making her stay with him. You may need to learn to listen to her words with a slightly different ear, however. You do that by thinking ""what is her second goal?"" and analysing her behaviour, and then talking to her about it.

This is an extraordinarily negative thing to do, and seems to have little purpose except to reinforce the idea that your recovery is completely out of your hands, and is tied-up in support other people won't give. This simply isn't how recovery works - it's a vessel for blaming others and feeling powerless yourself."

The way you phrased this makes me worry slightly that the idea to have them turn back came first and the character motivation will have to just be whatever it needs to be to make that work (which will feel forced)."

You can probably be kinder than I just was, and this will stop him having his feelings hurt. His feelings are tied into a sense of being able to help you, that's actually why he feels the need to say this.

Perhaps remind him that not saying it lets you speak your mind without feeling like you were ignored. Saying nothing is the help."
