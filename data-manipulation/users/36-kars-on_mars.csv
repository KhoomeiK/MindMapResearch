ShitPostCrusaders,fgk24fl,t1_fgjinpd,1580855912.0,"I really *really* like fictional serial killers, so Kira is my favorite JoJo antagonist as far as overall character traits go. I like how Araki borrowed Thomas Harris's use of contradictory personality traits to make the character more intriguing and alien (e.g. his obsession with cleanliness and order contrasted with his stand's use of literal explosions.) Harris did the same thing with Hannibal Lecter by making him a cannibal who chose victims who were impolite. Idiosyncrasies like that are extremely entertaining, I think."

NoStupidQuestions,fgew5b2,t1_fged3wj,1580712313.0,The police also brought back one of Dahmer's victims who had escaped; a 14 year old boy who ran out drugged and naked into the night. Dahmer killed him later that night.
Switch,fgeqpsj,t3_exwhau,1580706762.0,"This is largely why I went physical after having a completely digital 3DS collection. Not only have I been able to find games much cheaper, I'm also able to lend games to friends and resell them if I ever want to do so. I understand the appeal of a digital library, but I've been much happier with going physical on the Switch."

Apparently one of the new male DLC characters can be romanced. Really, it's an inconsequential part of the game compared to past entries. I understand why though given that so much of it takes place in what's essentially a high school."

evangelionmemes,fgctozp,t1_fgcsz3l,1580676154.0,"Sure. Heck, as starved for affection as I am I'd probably fall into the same trap."
Animemes,fgc5ass,t1_fgc2rsr,1580669286.0,"Oh for sure. Hera was way into infanticide. Big hobby of hers. Artemis turned one of her attendants into a bear and hunted her down because the poor girl got pregnant. Incidentally, that's where Ursa Major and Minor come from. But about Hera. I know it's the fun thing to just call her a bitch, which admittedly she was, but there's a reason behind all of it from a religious point of view. 

Hera was the goddess of marriage. Zeus, as you well know, was about as faithful as an alley cat in estrus. Every one of his indiscretions was a violation of her realm of influence, but since he was a god she was unable to take the required action that piety demanded. Where does this leave a very angry goddess? Her only outlet was to punish the mortals who had participated in the violation of her marriage with Zeus, willingly, knowingly, or otherwise. This also extended to their children. I know this still makes her sound a bit petty, but the gods *had* to punish violations of their realms of influence. They couldn't just let things slide. Some sort of recompense had to be made. Now, she could have been much nicer about it. She didn't have to go scorched earth like she did, but still she wasn't being completely fickle and capricious."
Animemes,fgc2kv7,t1_fgc0klh,1580668443.0,The Ganymede and Nerites arcs would for sure get it banned. Might as well throw Endymion in there for true gender equality. The female gods could be pervs too.
Animemes,fgbzgi6,t1_fgbyxgq,1580667577.0,"Not everyone. Semele was a very willing participant. She also had his favorite son. Well, mostly. Being vaporized did put a kink in things, but Zeus saved the baby by sewing him into his scrotum."
Animemes,fgbyy8f,t1_fgb3bik,1580667408.0,"Greek mythology is only considered classy because it's old. I have a degree in classical studies and my focus was on Greek culture and religion, and I can tell you that these people were class A nutjobs. Gods taking over towns with drunken Asians and killing their cousins, castrations left and right, *everybody* fucking their sisters, the moon raped a guy, and that's just the mythology. 

The actual day to day religious activity could get pretty wild too. The animal they would sacrifice to the gods had to *want* to be sacrificed, so they would dump a bucket of water on its head so it would nod when the priest would ask if it wanted to have its throat slit. Then they would pull out its organs and go through them to see if everything was cool with Demeter or whoever, and then have a party."
Animemes,fgbvyne,t1_fgbfs77,1580666606.0,Tiny correction. Selene is the moon goddess. Semele was the mother of the god Dionysus. Selene also knocked out a young shepherd named Endymion and raped him once a month until they had 50 daughters.
ShitPostCrusaders,fga9j6h,t1_fga4m3z,1580648449.0,"I don't think I'd categorize filicide as wholesome, though Diavolo might back you up."
Animemes,fga9djw,t1_fga8jtt,1580648393.0,Chaos wasn't really a distinct personality. It was just the potentiality out of which everything else came. Sort of like how cosmic dust collapses into stars and planets.

jewelry,fg9ugsv,t1_fg9h3fl,1580643344.0,"I have some 22ct chain anklets that some Indian friends gave me. They're lovely, but very delicate. Definitely have to be cautious with them."
Animemes,fg9qr1z,t1_fg93yyg,1580642118.0,"Like I said, bad idea. After all that went down, Kronos went batty and ate all of his kids (that he had with his sister Rhea) except for Zeus. After Zeus freed his siblings with the help of a potion from Metis, there was a giant war and Kronos was chucked down into Tartarus with a bunch of his siblings. 

This pissed Grandma Gaia off something fierce, so she jumped into bed with Tartarus (the god) and gave birth to Typhon. Typhon was born to wreck Olympian shit, and all of the gods except Zeus ran to Egypt and pretended to be animals so he couldn't find them. But ol Sparky won the day eventually, and everyone came back to Greece.

Lesson: don't fuck Mother Earth, and be nice to her kids.

Edit: Oh yeah! Guess what happened to Ouranos' junk? Well, Zeus threw it into the ocean and from the blood, cum, and sea water came the lovely Aphrodite. Who then proceeded to seduce an underage sea god and turn him into a shrimp for not wanting to leave his family. Fucked up bunch, the Greek gods."
