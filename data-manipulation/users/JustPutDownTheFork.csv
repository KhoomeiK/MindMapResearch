The thing that amazed me the most was the older generation, THAT TOLD ME HOW MUCH THEY SUFFERED UNDER COMMUNISM, would get together once a month and wear red sashes around their neck and reminisce about the good ole days of the Soviet Union. I mean it was mostly and excuse to get together with old friends and drink vodka, but still it was done under the guise of reminiscing."

The ones that were from the same post soviet region all agreed she left because I wouldn’t beat her.

Ain’t that some shit."
JustBootThings,ff4q6yo,t1_ff1jfjm,1579569795.0,I think the still in/transitioning bit is important. In a lot of hiring I have done that would give you a leg up. If you have been out and spent 6 years selling tv packages and use a military headshot it’s going to get lots of eye rolls.

It’s just me and my kid and we mostly eat lean meats fruits and veggies, but when I head out to family gatherings, for example my little sisters birthday party last night, it was heaping amounts of spaghetti. My parents may have been able to resist but not me, 6 of moms meatballs, a plate full of spaghetti, probably 2 cups of moms marinara, and that’s on top of the home made carrot cake, sautéed mushroom, a bottle of wine, garlic bread, some cheese appetizers and of course sneaking handfuls of freshly grated Parmesan while my mother chased me out of the kitchen with a wooden spoon!

Edit: i just noticed I put we were Italian....  we are still Italian Lmao"

You indicated beating a senior is shittier than doing 4 months in jail.

Making one event worse than the other.

This can be brought back to a classic “would you rather?” As in would you rather beat a senior citizen or do 4 months in jail?

Without the one action, the second is non existent. This is the best explanation I can make as to why they cannot be compared."

I am in no way trying to defend those two things but you logically can not compare them. Are you trying to ask if 4 months is justice?"
cincinnati,ff49hlj,t1_ff48tjt,1579558465.0,"Well assaulting a senior is something he did to a senior, and the time in jail is going to be a shitty experience for him. You can’t really compare those two thing... I mean is it shittier to assault a senior or to spend 4 months in jail? That question doesn’t really compute."
fatlogic,ff49bsg,t1_ff48n08,1579558364.0,"Oh and aside from my other comment SUPER CONGRATULATIONS ON THE WEIGHT LOSS! That’s really commendable and an awesome thing! You talk about the normalization of being over weight, I am a single dad of a five year old girl. Saturday we were at the new balance store getting myself a new pair of running shoes. My daughter tried on a pair of kids new balance running shoes and proceeded to sprint around the store yelling “papa look at me I’m so fast!” 

So I asked her if she wanted to start jogging with the dog instead of walking. And she enthusiastically stated yes and that she bet she was faster than the dog now. 

So keep in mind I’m not talking about training my five year old for a marathon but two women in their  forties and overweight decided to chime in and chastise me saying that a little girl should be allowed to relax and be waited on hand and foot. Like who gives a shit if my kid wants to run. maybe encourage physical activity instead of acting like it’s anathema.

Sorry to go off on a rant. It’s still bugging me."

He will be doing 4 months in jail, not prison. Even when sentence to a lengthy prison sentence an inmate will often sit in jail for a year+ waiting for classification and assignment to a prison."
cincinnati,ff33081,t1_fesxvg3,1579532357.0,"He won’t be going to prison. A four month sentence will be served in Hamilton County Jail, maybe one of the work camps if he’s lucky.

Do you think bombs discriminate on combatants vs families? Do you think the conscripted men were enemy combatants?

Far more civilians would have been lost in a ground invasion.  The Japanese army was 4 million strong with 31 million conscripts that would be used as fodder. If I am disturbed, you are mentally challenged."
iran,fdp51eo,t1_fdp4jj1,1578620157.0,"I never said what the motivation behind it was whether saving US lives or deterring the Soviet Union.

And I never said >200,000 US lives. A ground invasion would have been devestating to both sides. It does not require an us vs them mentality.

Let me simplify this. Do you believe if a ground invasion had been conducted, which was planned, less lives would have been lost?

Considering we killed 100k civilians in just the firebombing of Tokyo, do you not think this would have continued with a prolonged ground war?

I am not arguing the motivations or intent of any event. Just saying that causing an unconditional surrender undeniably was a net save for life of US and Japanese people."

depression,fdm21gp,t1_fdm1by3,1578537938.0,"Bruh. With rare exceptions, trolls don’t get laughs. They hurt the more fragile and are revolting to the rest of people. Again the rare creative or witty comment aside. But the shit you are posting is lame. It’s not even creative. It’s like Tom Green going for the shock value. You are depressed, you have limited energy. Spend that energy on something more positive than making weird  and creepy comments. 

Like I don’t know you and honestly I don’t really give a shit other than the fact that you have depression and kids (unless that was another troll) and whereas you can be as useless as possible I fight hard against my depression to give my kid the best life. So you can either toss yourself and remove your toxicity from your kids lives or fight on their behalf to better yourself."
depression,fdm11rj,t1_fdm0st3,1578537270.0,Can you extrapolate the negativity there? By trolling you are looking to be inflammatory. It leads to that head space. Do not misunderstand me. I am not going a /r/thanksimcured it’s all in your head answer. What I’m saying is it leads down a dark path which tends to inflame already depressive thoughts.
depression,fdm09tc,t3_elzym0,1578536745.0,"Man, reading through your comment history have you ever just thought maybe you’re not depressed, you’re just an asshole making excuses. Or shit, maybe you are depressed and you are still an assshole.

I’m not saying they get a pass, I’m just saying being raised by ass backwards racists is a component outside of the control of children. Even if you can see the whole of human history, slavery, and bigotry; how at 16 are you supposed to understand that when your whole life your parents have been telling you Jews controls the media, blacks rape, Obama is African, etc.

Again not saying I believe those things but I know at 16 I was pretty damn influenced by my parents beliefs.
