TrollXOver30,fffhaa5,t1_ffdltye,1579883937.0,Thanks for responding. You're right on every point. It's so frustrating that we both want a better relationship but we can't move forward on improving our relationship.
TrollXOver30,ffd1fcb,t3_essv5j,1579811523.0,"I'm living with my mom for a few months to save money.  My dad died many years ago and my mom and I never really connected. 

She's very supportive -- almost to a fault. I feel guilty that I don't have a better relationship with her. I just can't share my real thoughts with her. I've struggled with things and I can't talk to her about it because she just says ""hindsight is 2020"" and ""everything happens for a reason."" I don't know why her saying those things fills me with rage or makes me feel suffocated.

I can't trust her to be honest with me. If she was annoyed by me (because two people used to living alone are bound to annoy each other) she will never tell me. I tried to talk about something she did that annoyed me and she practically sprinted away from me. I wanted to have a conversation because she said my dad used to give her the silent treatment and hinted that it hurt her when he did that (she would never tell me openly that her feelings were hurt). I was trying to not be like my dad and have an open conversation but she shut it down and made me feel worse so yeah, I didn't want to talk to her for a day or so after that.

I hope some commenters here can offer perspective because it feels so trivial and yet I find myself angry and depressed and suffocating. And I'm stuck here for several more months."

GoldandBlack,ff5xcpp,t3_ermvu8,1579613370.0,FFS expressing support for Epstein is no way to win people over. A Libertarian candidate said this? He couldn't bring up the number of people who are attacked by the police every year? He had to use Epstein as an example? What an idiot. I hate there are Libertarians out there giving the rest of us a bad name.

TheExpanse,feo48pl,t1_fenxevx,1579294948.0,I'm just reading Leviathan Wakes now and I think he was described as being a decent cop before his divorce. So the prequel would have to start while he's still married.

getdisciplined,fenm9o6,t1_fen1p15,1579287714.0,"I use Google tasks. Right now most of my talks have little red ""past due"" notes next to them. So I'll be happy when the little red notes are gone!"
getdisciplined,fenkq10,t1_fenfn02,1579286766.0,Yeah it usually helps me figure out the next step in a project if I just write down all my random thoughts.
getdisciplined,fen0qp5,t3_epzxm2,1579274381.0,"I do this, too. And I work from home so I'm mostly alone with no one to watch me avoid my work!

I try whatever technique works in the moment. Sometimes it's a pomodoro (work on the task for 20 minutes, then take a break). Sometimes I sit and write on a piece of paper all my scattered thoughts about the task. Sometimes I journal about why I'm avoiding it. 

Lately my biggest motivator has been that feeling of relief when I get a lot of tasks done in a day. Essentially, I think of how happy my future self will be when the task is no longer weighing me down."
pitbulls,femzynb,t1_femxze5,1579273864.0,"Just luck! I got him specifically to have some encouragement to get up and walk in the mornings, but he failed at that job. He stays in the warm and soft bed until he's certain getting up will be worth it (like when he hears me preparing breakfast)."

clientsfromhell,fekcwba,t3_epmbfq,1579197410.0,Seems like a common issue in your line of work. Are your coworkers upset about this? Are you upset about this? Seems like you can take it as a lesson learned and move on.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fejujkb,t3_ephjgk,1579186172.0,"There's a difference between feelings and action. No matter what trauma or upbringing someone experienced, they still make a decision on how to act in a new situation. And you make a decision on how to react. You can empathize with a LVM, and still choose to block him because his actions are not in line with what you need from a partner."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fejthe0,t3_ep80u5,1579185459.0,I evicted that man in my head watching and judging me. That's when I finally was happy being single. This sub helped!
JUSTNOMIL,feek8wr,t3_eolooy,1579035444.0,Ugh I feel you! My mom is obsessed with pictures. My dad died in an accident just before Easter and my mom insisted we color eggs and take pictures of coloring eggs. It made me feel like my grief didn't matter. I'm so sorry your family couldn't respect you in your grieving.

Pitbull,fdlmm6o,t3_elwux2,1578527454.0,"Have you tried a bully stick? My pit mix will chomp through a raw hide in minutes, but a full-sized bully stick takes hours. I usually take it away when he gets through half and save it for later."

seasteading,fdh907p,t3_eldjap,1578417988.0,This article is terrible. The journalist makes no effort to hide her contempt for Seasteaders or anyone who wants to improve human society by experimenting with new governance structures.
jobs,fdh2lpv,t3_elcj2n,1578414029.0,"Do you know the term ""manage up""? I believe it's the concept of communicating with your manager to help get yourself in a better position. Complete the tasks assigned to you, then ask for more. Ask to be included in higher level projects and planning. If you're not showing initiative then maybe your supervisor doesn't know he can trust you with more interesting tasks."
AskLibertarians,fdf8r2k,t1_fdesixn,1578355939.0,Fair enough. I'm still not a Republican.
AskLibertarians,fdejezy,t1_fdeidbn,1578340298.0,"Not OP, but I left that part of my ballot blank. Bill Weld is essentially a Republican, so he was definitely not going to get my vote. Trump and Clinton are also repulsive. I don't owe my vote to any of them. I know it doesn't matter on the whole, but my vote is the only mechanism I have for making my voice heard. If more voters actually understood how to participate in the process so that we're not stuck with trash on the ballot, maybe voting would matter. It serves the people in power to make voters believe they don't have the right to real representation. F*** that narrative. If not even libertarians can claim their right to be heard then there's no point in anything."
AskLibertarians,fdeiyet,t3_ekxv6x,1578340020.0,"I default to voting for Libertarian candidates if I don't specifically know any of the candidates, especially for state-level and lesser known offices. It's unlikely that the Libertarian will win, so I do want to convey to the political class that they do not own my vote. If Libertarians were likely to win, I would be more careful about researching and only vote for candidates that I can whole-heartedly support.

It is VERY VERY VERY important to support Libertarians to retain ballot access because if we lose ballot access in one state it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to get that ballot access back. If we had an excellent candidate, that candidate would have to use all resources just to getting ballot access, not spreading the message of liberty."
AskLibertarians,fd64nuf,t3_ejy9is,1578185478.0,When was the last time that voting for Republicans or Democrats decreased the national debt or prevented war or ended the drug war or reduced regulations or decreased taxes?
