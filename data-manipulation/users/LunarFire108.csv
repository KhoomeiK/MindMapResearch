botw,ffik4s7,t3_etaciq,1579975789.0,Sank a guardian in the brown bog where the giant skeleton is in Hyrule field. Basically I kept trying to get its attention to come closer to me and tried to edge it in by chopping off its legs. I even have picture proof XD

If so, you need to go back to the Yiga clan hideout, sneak past the big guys patrolling, grab the orb which is located above the room full of Yiga clan members and throw it in the hole to trigger the shrine to appear"

botw,ffcoxw4,t3_esr0jv,1579804097.0,I farm silver bokgoblins and Lynel. I actually managed to sink a Guardian in the bogs(brown water) near the big skeleton full of enemies.
botw,ffcompg,t3_eswyk8,1579803914.0,"Collect all the gear in game and if you bought the DLC, collect the gear from that too. Upgrade the ancient set to max for the ultimate defense wear and upgrade the barbarian set if you wanna be almost one shotting every enemy. If you haven't mastered parrying yet, I recommend you practice that as well as flurry rush. 

Try doing some quests in Hyrule castle like the cookbook quest and dont forget to grab the hylien shield from in there. 

The thing about restarting is after you beat Ganon, your save will recieve a star and if you collected all the memories before you beat him you will get a special cutscene at the end. There is no post game and you will always be in the same predicament of having to fight Ganon again.So even if you beat Ganon once, you can still go around completing everything and play the DLC as well. But not to worry because a sequel is coming ;)"

depression,fchdd1h,t3_eh41bc,1577649474.0,I only have one friend who initiates conversations with me but everyone else I have to start first. Its even worse when you feel like you are annoying them because they dont respond right away or soon for that matter. I try not to go crazy thinking they are just busy with life but it's even worse when they read it and no reply. Like do I matter to them at all?
unpopularopinion,fcg688t,t3_eh1qom,1577636886.0,"All the pokemon mystery dungeon soundtracks in general. I highly recommend this game to anyone even if you aren't a fan of pokemon, you will still love the story and the music! I cant choose which mystery dungeon game has the best music because they all have such iconic tracks that trigger a wave of happy memories to anyone who played it before. Also Witcher 3 has an amazing soundtrack as well. I'm in love with Priscilla song and the battle theme for Olgierd."
depression,fc97i8a,t3_egqg5d,1577548266.0,"Stories like that give the false impression of hope to anyone watching. By seeing someone else come out from nothing, another person believes they can achieve that as well. Is it possible? Yes it is but these stories only highlight the good parts, never the bad ones. Basically it's called being in the right place at the right time or knowing the right people. 

Take it as this~ you are your own success story by living another day. You don't need the flashy cameras and inspirational music over your life for it to be a success story. You may not be as well known for what you've done but you've done enough to feel proud of who you are."

Even though they are put on a higher social pedestal, they are still a human who have the same course of life like anyone else. Also every celebrity is replaceable. Once they age too much, a new wave of talented and good looking people will fill in their shoes as they ride the cocktails of fame. Sure you'll have a legacy of being known as this famous person but someone will eventually replace you in the end. It's the same cycle again and again. Why should I waste my time obsessing over someone who will eventually get replaced by the newest hip boy band or singer from some random music show? I'll gladly enjoy the product they put out but I'm not putting them before myself because society says they are better than me in social status."
unpopularopinion,fc5a42s,t3_eg3igl,1577450625.0,"My brother is disabled and I can see my love as a sibling for him diminishing the older I get. Even though my childhood wasn't hell with him in it, their were still many things I could not do because of his existence. I could never do after school activities like clubs or sports because I had to be there to pick him up off his van from his school. Going out in public with him is a nightmare because he screams like a madman if he is upset or just playing around and the stares we got were embarrassing. Also the fact I would get punished if I wasn't taking care of him properly. Like when I change him,  its messy and a simple wipe is too small so I use a paper towel to prevent any of the feces touching my hand and my mom got angry that I would do that. I may sound morbid for saying this but their was this one time where he almost suffocated on his vomit without my knowledge and at this point, I wish he did die at that time instead of being saved by my mom and her punishing me for being neglectful. 

My biological dad was a smart man to run far far away from the situation. I kinda wish he took me with him though. Thankfully I'm not legally his second guardian yet but once I move out, I'm gone. If I were to visit, I would clearly state that i would not visit if he was around. My brother is the reason I am not having kids because I am sick of changing diapers for him so I'm not even going to have a child at all that I have to do that for. I don't know if they had the technology to see if he was disabled in the womb when my mom was pregnant but if they did, why in gods name did she not abort? 

Also when I had a breakdown about being sick of taking care of him while her and her new man can do whatever the fuck they want, she is like ""I didn't choose this life."" Uh yes you did! You could have not had children or adopted a child that wasn't disabled. It sickens me that someone gave her a plaque that said something about a special needs child being ""a child that just needs a little more care."" 

I'm ready to live the life my brother took away from me in my childhood and ain't no one taking that away from me or I'm going to have to fight them. So please, if the doctor detects that your child will be disabled please abort it for your own sanity. Unless you want a child throwing loud temper tantrums when they are 20+, having to constantly change a diaper for the rest of your life because they will never be potty trained, having to pay more money for any services your child needs because of their disability, having to pay for therapy for the able bodied child you emotionally neglect and forcing them to bottle up their feelings because it's not as bad as they sibling has it, never have time to take vacations or go out because your child needs supervision and care 24/7, etc. Its not a blessed life with a disabled child and it's even worse to be a sibling to that child."
misanthropy,fc3d6rj,t1_fc3bwwi,1577387191.0,Oh I barely use it tbh. I only check it for memes or to text some of my friends. It's only when I check their stories on Instagram is when I see things like this. I'm about to delete FB because some of my old friends are annoying when they post.

misanthropy,fc2rzjx,t3_eft7ks,1577372313.0,"This is the same feeling I get when people blast social media about money they gave to people for presents or buying them presents. All the pictures and videos are the same script, person recieving gift/money is super happy and holding said object in their hand with the person next to them smiling with a thumbs up. The videos are always supposed to be tear jerkers with a sob story about that person struggling and yadda yadda. Don't get me wrong, it's nice they do that for people but some part of me feels like they only do it cause they have the chance to post all of it on social media."
depression,fc1c7s2,t3_efj7ls,1577314414.0,"I felt pretty happy with the presents I got until my mom made a comment on the last one. It was a Switch Lite and she then commented ""That's the last video game thing I'm buying you cause you are getting too old. If you want to buy your own, go get a job."" I understand her sentiment but that just hurt that she would bring up jobs at what is supposed to be a festive day. I already have enough stress trying to find a job and she just had to remind me about it."
