StarWarsCantina,fg36x1d,t1_fg35vde,1580472733.0,"Well, JJ set up snoke, for example. In TLJ, Rian killed him off and JJ had to work around it. JJ set up Rey's parents. Rian said they were nobody. JJ had to work around it. Also, I hate to be cliche, but Rose and Luke are both horrible characters in this movie. For example, Luke is not like Luke at all. His quote about a ""lasersword"" shows that. Luke would never say that. Rey's ""training"" was also stupid, mostly because all she did was reach out to the force and cut a rock in half with terrible lightsaber technique. And the beloved throne room scene. That had horrible choreography. If you look at that scene, there's so many times where Rey should be dead. Please reply with your point of view, because I'm genuinely interested. Oh, one more thing. A beautiful star wars movie does not make a good star wars movie."

Not TLJ because it undos everything that TFA established, and it's not a good star wars movie. I'm not denying it's a good movie, because it's pretty good, but as a star wars movie is where it falls short"
