Scroll down to the “Examples Of Right and Left Turns” and see the example of legit turns. If you turn into multiple lanes road, you can turn into whatever lane you want. Unless you have >=2 turn lanes then you proceed as the marking indicated.

The only scenario it doesn’t cover is the scenario where you have multiple X lane turns and you turn into Y lanes road where Y > X. It does not happen often, but I really want to find  out because my exit home turn left from 2 lanes into a 4 lanes without proper marking.

FuckYouKaren,fg04gk9,t1_fg026wc,1580400000.0,"I think you grew up in English environment so you have skewed perception of what a simple language is. Take my language, Vietnamese for example. The following is just from the top of my head.

You don't have weird rules like You and I, both I and You - You and I work. There is no gender, no a-an-the/these-those/some-a lot. Fuck that complicated shit.

There is also no tense rule to remember. Want to indicate future, past , etc? Either throw the time somewhere in your sentence, or use the explicit word like future, past, present before your verb. And the sentence I just wrote was horrible grammatically in English. In Vietnamese, as long as it's explicit enough, it's valid.

There is also no rule for plural/singular. Fuck that shit. Use explicit word. Why the fuck it has to be 2 cats and not 2 cat in English? They are literally the same thing. And why do some shit end in s, es, or use a different form altogether? We have one fucking form for word. That's it.

For speaking, as long as you know how to spell the alphabet in Vietnamese, you can pronounce every single word, even if you have never seen it before. And they have distinctive sounds, so no chance of hearing it wrong. You never have the sheet-shit/queue-cue crap, or have unnecessary debate about how to pronounce a word. And vice versa, if you heard a word, you can spell it to the exact letter. No chance of confusion. 

The only thing makes it look hard are the tonal signs, but it's because people assume the tonal is modification of a main letter. It's not, the character and tonal sign form a new letter by itself. So our alphabet has 26 more letters than English alphabet, that's it."

Or if I am serious he would direct me to proper class or resources so I don't suck anymore. I wanted to apply for scholarship in the US so my teachers let me off the intense cramming for entrance exam, instead I had time to studied for Toefl and SAT. It's not perfect, and most students just went through the motion, but the support was there for you to do your planning.

Schools in the US could direct poor students on how to apply for scholarship, picking student loans, or choose trade school that give them a better future if they are not academically inclined. Or military/ROTC if they don't mind the possibility of combat. 

My school graduation cohort consist of about 825 students, headed by 15 home teachers in my year (55 students per classroom). While my highschool was one of the best in the city, we were right in middle of the blue collar district of a poor as shit country in Asia.

It's a little more work, but much better than going in life and just wing it. In my country we also have future planning as activity before taking graduation exam in my country, basically what you wanna do, if you want to go to college which college entrance exam group you would take, how would you pay for school etc. Granted nearly 100% of students take the college entrance exam, groups were decided by students since 10 grade, and our tuition fee is so cheap the teacher just fill in a form for all students.

However, in the US tuition is so expensive, and there is no entrance exam, I think the planning would help a lot. You want to earn a degree in psychology but your grade and extra curricular are not enough to get a full ride, probably should reconsider apply for out of state school where tuition is 50k a year.
