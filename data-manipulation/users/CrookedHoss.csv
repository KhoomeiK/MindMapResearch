LateStageCapitalism,ffzi50u,t1_ffyz4vc,1580380326.0,The kind of society that can actually do ubi is also the kind of society that can stop feeding the warpig.  The savings there would be immense.
LateStageCapitalism,ffzi0f6,t1_ffvun4k,1580380142.0,Ehhhhhhhhhh.  I don't think there are any conservatives on reddit with that kind of self awareness to care so little about their own poverty as long as black people have it worse.
Showerthoughts,ffzgmj5,t3_evzvh5,1580378099.0,Uh-uh.  Gen X and boomers did that.  Most millennials weren't even of voting age yet.
OurPresident,ffzgk68,t1_ffzau48,1580378001.0,It's honest.  It drags the Overton window leftward.
OurPresident,ffzgi92,t1_ffzcxui,1580377924.0,"You vote your conscience in tje primaries, and to get tbe best possible candidate for the generals.  In the generals  if you didn't get what you want then you vote to avert fascism. As in checks-the-boxes authoritarian right-wing ultranationism.  As in, what Trump and his cronies are trying to create.  They're trying to make him their King. 

If you want to punish shitty blues, primary them.  Kick them out.  Pull an AOC and interrupt their presumptive succession.  

Anyway.  It's not ""blue no matter who.""  It's ""Don't let the fascists win."""
OurPresident,ffzg8l0,t1_ffzckvl,1580377541.0,Especially considering they KNEW they were ruining lives and ecosystems to sate their greed.  A thief who takes some jewelry gets a decade.  An oil baron who poisons a river and everyone who depends on it for their lives should get the guillotine.
TwoXChromosomes,ffz9q6z,t1_ffz6zc9,1580368675.0,"I wasn't even getting into the content of the answer; I was talking about the sarcasm.  There's no reason for it other than to pick a fight.

What baffles me is that there are actually people who get upset at someone calling someone else's snide behavior out."
TwoXChromosomes,ffyysqm,t1_ffywtub,1580358669.0,"Are we really going to do this?  Do we actually want to get pissy at each other, or can you quit the shitty sarcasm?"
TwoXChromosomes,ffyung9,t1_ffysiq7,1580355569.0,"I appreciate the sentiment, but in all seriousness, *please do not attempt to knee someone in the groin.*  It's something we were taught by TV and movies as an instant boy-disabling attack, but the success rate of groin shots is abysmally low.  It's bad enough when you're just using your foot; knees are even worse.

There are two legs that can easily get in the way, especially if you're shorter than they are.  You have to get the extremity between two legs; glancing off of either one of them will severely diminish the impact upon arrival.  Both of these legs are capable of independent movement, so the attempt is even less likely to succeed.  If they're standing somewhat angled, the window is even narrower.

Then, you have to arrive with enough force to cause disabling damage.  This is past the normal range of motion for most leg activities, so the attack is likely to lose most of its force on the way up.

Then, you have to hope it works.  Not all guys are disabled by nut shots, and not all of those are disabled instantly.  For some of them it just makes them *mad*, and they can cause serious damage back to you if the attack doesn't disable them right away.  

If unarmed combat is going to be part of your actual strategy against predators, do take some classes, absolutely.  If they teach you to be the groin-kneeing queen, have at it...but please do not, without training, go for the groin."
IBEW,ffyttbv,t3_evyt6p,1580354965.0,"This is something you really should talk to your training director about.  Apprentices have been held back a year for failing too many classes, and you'll likely have to talk to the board, but it's better to give them the heads-up now than to wait to fail out.  

If you can get there after work tomorrow, do it.  If you can call ahead and schedule and appointment with your training director, do that also, so you're not just dropping in.  You may find it helpful to write down what you want to say in advance.  It's like rehearsing, almost.

Also, if you're in a *really* shaky position, consider collecting recommendation letters.  Having good JWs vouch for you will improve your chances of staying in."
LifeProTips,ffy64m8,t3_evt3mf,1580339288.0,I think you might be confusing introversion with social anxiety.  Introverts simply recharge by spending tine alone; they can be quite sociable in the wild.
IBEW,ffy5ufc,t1_ffxwvny,1580339128.0,okay boomer
IBEW,ffy0du8,t3_evsnmw,1580336036.0,"Definitely wait.  Tools are no good if you don't use them. Besides, some halls have the hookup on tool bundles."
todayilearned,ffxry53,t1_ffxqvy8,1580331237.0,">Yeah...we have a word for that dipshit it's called a JOB. And the money you get paid is what society has deemed is the value you provide.

False.  The money you get paid is what YOUR BOSS has deemed that he's able to get away with paying you.  Your second paragraph is full of piss and wind without any substance.  Surprise surprise, a guy who claims he's from a ""communist"" country therefore he knows communism better than the guy he's talking to will, instead of backing any of his claims up, go on to personally attack his doubters.  

I have a job.  I work 58 hours a week.  I drive an hour every day to get to that job, and an hour every day to get home from that job.  Yeah, you can go fuck yourself, as I've already stated.

Isn't it amazing how the targets and the arguments shift.  We go from communism having to be authoritarian in nature (according to you) to ""Well, we couldn't have real communism as you describe it because humans suck,"" which in no way acknowledges a basic fact...to a straw position wherein you declare that I think workers are somehow too lazy to provide for themselves.  Well.

You were wrong.

You don't know what words mean, or you do and you use them incorrectly on purpose.

You lean harder on insults in this comment than in any other, which tells me that for all your fury and noise you've got no actual arguments left to present.  I'll take this as the win that you were never going to admit to.

In summary:  You use words incorrectly out of ignorance or dishonesty, you ignore corrections, and you deploy insults in lieu of arguments rather than as supplements to them.

Eastern European, my ass.  I've flushed better shits down the toilet than you."
todayilearned,ffxpenv,t1_ffw25gp,1580329800.0,"What, a classless society where everyone contributes as they can and receives as they need?  Well, that doesn't sound too bad at all.  But I highly doubt your supposed ""communist Eastern European"" childhood, unless you also happened to be a particularly stupid and incurious person your entire life. 

Communism by definition precludes the existence of a ruling class.  That you seem to think it must be housed within a state of brutal dictators and corrupt bureaucrats indicates that you don't know what words mean, or you're an American product of decades of red scare propaganda, or both.

Learn what words mean before you use them.  You can start with the meaning of communism.  Go fuck yourself."
