TheMotte,fepky2g,t1_fekcada,1579323216.0,"Your essay and some discussion about the recent story helped me think about a few things.  Might be worth discussing.

Both the trans and the gender critical are sincere in their beliefs about the existence or non-existence of gender.  If gender is real, how can someone have literally no experience of it?  If it's fake, then where does dysphoria come from?  

Perhaps it is a wholly internal experience; Gender is created internally.  People who have rigid conceptualizations of gender roles and gendered behavior will experience dysphoria if they don't meet those expectations.  People who have wide conceptualizations of what constitutes acceptable gendered behavior are unlikely to experience dysphoria if they're highly non-conforming.  People who don't think any behavior is inherently gendered can never experience dysphoria, no matter how different their behavior is.  

In this model, there is no such thing as a female mind in a male brain.  However, there is such thing as a brain that experiences a distressing dissonance between their preferred expression and their internalized concept of their sexually assigned gender role.  An equally non-conforming person who internalized very liberal gender roles would not experience that dissonance. 

This idea (an extension of yours, I think) would help explain some of my experiences.  I've known some transwomen who deeply offended me by stating that liking jewelry and such was a way they knew they were women.  I've also met a trans-man who described how not liking to dress in certain ways and disliking certain social aspects of womanhood were ways he knew he was a man.  I was baffled, as I thought that dressing that way was irrelevant to womanhood, and I didn't like that aspect of female sociability, either, yet I am very comfortable with womanhood.  

Perhaps trans-people are regular non-conforming humans who have internalized extremely strict gender roles.  Is there any merit to this?  If so, would it be preferable to let them construct narrow genders and let them transition?  Or would it be preferable to widen their concept of gender roles?  Could this even be done?  The feminist movement tried to widen women's role, but it reinforces stereotypes every time it tries to subvert them.  There's a call for men to become more sensitive (unlike the past!) even as they flee from the caretaker role they once held in the family- one place some feminine qualities were important.  We seem to be heading toward a society that is, in some ways, more gendered than it ever has been.  Perhaps that is one reason there are more trans people than there used to be."

Could you cultivate a mentality like this in secular people?  You'd have to first convince them that their culture was in danger and worth saving.

I don't think that polish or heels or dresses or long hair are fundamental to being a woman.  They're coded feminine in our culture, but that's it.  There's no fundamental womanness about them.  Many of these things were masculine or androgynous in the past and will be again.  The only thing that doesn't change based on cultural context with manhood or womanhood is sexual function;  it's the only way to truly anchor an understanding of difference.

I know this isn't the point of your comment, but I think that you're seeing correlation, and assuming causation.  It's true that scientists are far less likely to believe in a god than the general public.  However, I don't think that science dissolves belief in God.  I majored in Physics in university, and had pretty close contact with Christians in other science fields.  I didn't see even one person leave their faith over the course of my studies.  As far as I've looked at it study wise, I can't discern that that's a thing.  

There are a lot of factors to disentangle in this topic.  For example, unintelligent people who are irreligious tend to believe in God but be largely ignorant of and completely disinterested in practicing their professed religion.  They would be counted among believers, despite being functionally atheistic.  

In addition, it's entirely possible that intelligent religious people fail to enter science at much higher rates than intelligent irreligious people.  I think there's pressure here from both directions. 
 Some religions traditions are skeptical of science.  You would expect even very capable people coming out of those to fail to enter science at higher than expected numbers.  On the flip side, at my university, there was a pretty marked hostility to theism in some scientific disciplines.  It certainly drove me off from studying a field I was interested in, to one that included believers, and I thus perceived as safer.  

So, I don't think that scientists are less likely to believe in God, but rather that people who believe in God are less likely to become scientists, and it may not be because of science itself, but rather a hiccup of surveying, or because of existing biases reinforcing a trend."

TheMotte,fdbx59t,t1_fdavg21,1578263301.0,"> What should humanities students be doing instead?

Most of the students currently in the humanities should be going into vocational training instead.

STEM is essentially middle to upper middle class vocational training for tech.  Business school is middle to upper middle class vocational training for corporate America.
 
The humanities are upper middle class social values training.  I think it's worthwhile and necessary, but we should have a tenth of the humanities students we currently have.  Quite simply:  Most jobs require vocational training, not values training.  Some humanities courses train students to be a therapist or are useful for social work.  These programs probably ought to continue as they are.  Most kids going into the less useful humanities wouldn't cut it in STEM, but might be good candidates for business school.  Others should instead be going into other vocational training; We need nurses, computer technicians, and plumbers.  

This is especially true with the high cost of college.  If we could lower tuition costs by 75%, (which we ought to be able to do!) then a case for learning good citizenship via humanities is easier to make.  However, it remains true that the majority of students should still focus on vocational training. Vocational training programs can be rounded out with a few humanities courses to produce proper citizens, but we don't need a lot of people to major in English lit or philosophy.  If college were cheaper, directing people to major in a vocation and minor in a humanity might be a better idea."
