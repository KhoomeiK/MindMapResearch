The market, the invisible hand has no direction, doesnt lead, doesnt empower morals it just is.

Why does it have to be wealth what we strive for? why do u want to have 5 disposable cars? why do u want to be able to shoot your neighbor country when they still live in the last epoch? why is it always about them and us? my solution is the big redemption, class holocaust, the deletion of hierarchy. engaging in some supernational multistate structure thats reasonably distributing ressources and coordinating their collection on a global scale to always ensure restoration capacity aka ressource based economy opposed to profit maximizing global market capitalism.

todayilearned,femdi1u,t1_femd2x4,1579249915.0,"mononoke was sooooo much more. it was also about progress, and how progress means destruction of the old, or even abandoning everything from before. How the old order is so stagnant and narrow minded and unable to adapt that it gets overrun by the new one. How individuals try to find their ways in between this conflict. it was about greed and ignorance and acceptance and coexistence. mononoke isnt one dimensional, like all ghibli works, thats what makes them stand out."
