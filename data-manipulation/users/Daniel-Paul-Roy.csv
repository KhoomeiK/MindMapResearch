aww,ffggaer,t1_ffg2b2c,1579905568.0,I wonder if chunky peanut butter would make it more difficult for dogs like Lucky.  It would be funny to return to a little pile of chopped peanuts AND the pill.
aww,fffmaeb,t3_etcmus,1579887020.0,Nothing a little peanut butter can't fix.
mildlyinteresting,fffjtb0,t1_fff83e5,1579885495.0,I was thinking maybe it stands for Nothing of Note.

pentax,ff44dzp,t1_ff3y165,1579555281.0,"Ah, that seems most likely.  I was thinking maybe there was some sort of Y2K-ish problem with Pentax firmware."

pentax,felsr3g,t1_fel5gsw,1579230017.0,Currently doing this.  Spot on!

aww,fedx0ug,t3_eonffw,1579021684.0,I wish more people would adopt instead of making new ones.
WTF,fe7rw39,t1_fdpjoh9,1578918519.0,That's the only flavor I buy now.  I really wish they'd sell it in powder form so I can over do it.

pentax,fdhol7r,t1_fdffkzx,1578427035.0,"I'm very happy with it.  The autofocus is very fast, accurate and nearly silent, compared to my other Pentax lenses.  I was a bit underwhelmed with it the first time I took it out, but this second outing made me very happy.  I don't own a K-1, but I have a feeling this lens will push me that way."
