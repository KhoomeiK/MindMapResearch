Once packed, roll down the top of the trash bag and tuck the flaps down. For smaller side pockets, do the same but with ziplock style bags. This method has been better than any water proofing or poncho method I’ve ever used."
fatlogic,fe3w6lo,t1_fe3cnnc,1578853433.0,I am all for the kid leash! It’s just a tool to keep kids safe. People are just judgy assholes.
fatlogic,fe2lg52,t1_fe22r7d,1578839943.0,"In the future, have them stand outside the door but with one foot under the door into the stall. This is how I’ve done it with my kids once they’re able to stand still for 30 seconds so I can pee in a public place. You can see their feet so they’re close enough, and if anyone is listening in, they know you’re watching over the kid."
femalefashionadvice,fdjuasa,t3_eligni,1578487726.0,"I carry a backpack for when I have more than just my wallet to carry. My wallet fits in my back pocket. 

I would like to find a backpack that is less school-backpack looking, any suggestions? Under $50."
fatlogic,fcwlhc9,t1_fcw3dkf,1578028953.0,"My doctor asked my weight, then said I must be mistaken so he weighed me. I was within 2 pounds of what I told him and he shrugged and apologized. He said almost all of his patients lie about their weight, or just pick what number they want to weigh. I am deceptively heavy, so people often act surprised when they hear my weight."

CampingGear,fcoll41,t3_ehnhqq,1577835299.0,"I have a kids tent from 20 years ago that still gets regular use. I bought it at target or walmart, but it was a lifetime ago. I increased the durability of the tent with regular waterproofing, and duct taped the bottom seams. Dimensions are 3’x5’ footprint, about 3’ tall in the center of the A frame."
AskReddit,fcocrqz,t3_ei21zo,1577829065.0,"Was doing an interview at work last week when the applicant told me he was a virgin. 

That’s cool and all, but this is a sewer plant and I don’t care about your penis."

ShitMomGroupsSay,fck1yhg,t1_fcjx47x,1577714127.0,"Yep, every time my kids go to the doctor they have bruises. The ped just shrugs and says that they must be active and getting a lot of play time."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fcjs0r4,t1_fcjd1i3,1577701748.0,"When my older two were 5 and 7 they both sustained the same injury three days apart. They went over the top of the bike handle bars and busted their mouths and loosened their front top teeth. First kid did it on Friday and I brought him straight to the dentist to get checked. Next kid did it on Monday, I started to panic. Would the dentist think I was punching my kids on the mouth? I brought both scuffed up bike helmets with me and was prepared to justify what happened. The dentist assured me that there are specific red flags of abuse and they’re trained to recognize standard kid injuries vs abuse. It was reassuring to know the dentist was trained on that."
namenerds,fc44vy6,t3_efyav8,1577406704.0,"Next time they intentionally call you the last name, ask them why they think it is appropriate to disrespect you. Then wait silently for them to answer. If they don’t answer or blow you off, hold firm and ask again, why are they insisting on being rude and upsetting you?"
preppers,fb3vz72,t3_eb5z8u,1576492220.0,"How are you transporting the kid? Baby carrier or stroller? If using a stroller, consider getting a double stroller secondhand, and you can stick all the stuff in with the kid. If using a baby carrier, I really like the sizing options kinderpack offers. I can comfortably carry my school age kid (who weighs more than 1/3 my weight) for 3+ miles without either or us needing a break."
