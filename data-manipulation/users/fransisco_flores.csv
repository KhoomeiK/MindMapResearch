OneBookAMonthClub,fghkvya,t1_fghkngn,1580787127.0,Reading an older book can be difficult as the words have slightly different meanings but overall it was fun. There was moments where I didn’t know if they would turn on each other or give in to the women that appeared in times of desire. I guess I was expecting some walking dead zombie shit. Haha
OneBookAMonthClub,fghk4ci,t3_exgxwr,1580786627.0,"Okay, so the book has ended. I found several things fascinating with this book though in the beginning it was hard to follow along (at least for me, the journal entries were a little too much). Anyhow, as the book went along I grew suspicious about several characters and the way they would act. Most specifically Lucy and Van Halen (garlic, etc). 

Now to the end, Dracula died very easily. I was expecting a fight, some ware wolves, something more meaningful than just dying in a box as he was diced in the throat and stabbed in the heart. I get it but I guess I was expecting more from Dracula, I mean he had everyone going crazy. All of them plotting. Overall, good first book."
