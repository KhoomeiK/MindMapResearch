witcher,ff1rb1v,t1_fex0a0x,1579484457.0,"I think you may have misread the other commentor's intention. They did not pessimisticly criticize the franchise itself but were highlightning Sapkowski's perceptions of and relations with the games/CDPR. The legal implications of the lawsuit here is irrelevant. The crux of the previous comment is that he did not show support and enthusiasm until the games took off. 

Even then he tries to downplay the game's influence and significance. He explicitly said in an interview (linked below) ""It was not so that the games promote me: I promoted the games with my name and characters"" when it was blatantly the other way around and refuses to acknowledge CDPR's achievement in giving his works more exposure.


When he sold the license to CDPR, he took the money upfront believing the games would fail. CDPR invested a lot of time and effort and took until Witcher 3 for the brand to truly go mainstream. It was then that Sapkowski invoked Polish copywrite law to gain a better settlement from the former deal. 

Regardless of the lawsuit involving the initial licensing deal, he is [dismissive of the games in previous interviews when in reality they probably are the main reason he's got readers and recognition all over the globe now.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-24-meeting-andrzej-sapkowski-the-writer-who-created-the-witcher)

Sapkowski does owe a lot to CDPR telling the story through another medium, but he laments that most people meeting him assumes that the game itself came out first and his written works were actually based from CDPR's game. Therefore, the source of his dissatisfaction was that a derivative of his work has (for now) outshone his own and may feel that CDPR is taking all the credit for his creation."
