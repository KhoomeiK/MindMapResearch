phoenix,ffqeqf1,t1_ffqedjd,1580132390.0,"There are no rules to prevent a person from having a business account. 

The only rules are you can't have a consumer account at a business zoned location. You can have a business account at a residence for things like home offices and the like. 

It is the remnants of net neutrality, the old rules were worse a government imposed 250GB cap at least now the companies can set their limits and now its 1TB"
phoenix,ffpu5wc,t1_ffo6az7,1580105831.0,"As a Small Business back office employee of CenturyLink I can say this they do not charge for excessive data usage but that quote doesn't say there is no cap. There is a cap like COX it is very high on consumer accounts. 

Small Business accounts have no cap. There is a prepaid service for small business called Simple and is for speeds up to 140M for $65/mo

To the initial question, yes a phone Jack is required, your current COX modem has a cable wire connected to it, whereas DSL requires a phone connection to provide the same."

phoenix,fecfgya,t1_fe9ro49,1578972655.0,"Cable companies use coax cable whereas CenturyLink still uses phone wiring so one can offer fiber connection and another can offer copper connection and vice versa, they do not share an input."
phoenix,fecfbti,t1_fecefom,1578972560.0,"ONT is just a term for CenturyLink's terminal.  Basically it's where the Internet is generated from. So for example the oldest copper DSL is generated at the central office and goes copper wires all the way to the side of the house hence why DSL was crappiest, then they came out with a newer technology (VDSL) fiber to the node where the central office provided a fiber wire all the way to the terminal where that generated the Internet at the terminal then copper to the side of the house which is a better than standard copper DSL, The ont typically on the site of the premise is where the Internet is generated and then the network interface is where the copper wire starts hence why I can offer gigabit at the house.

uber,fe9dwmf,t1_fe9dcey,1578936672.0,So I  can accuse someone of something go to the police and they'd run a plate for me? I don't think so.
uber,fe9d339,t3_eo71js,1578936465.0,"Isn't it considered an abuse of power for him to a) run the plates since they wouldn't normally and b) since he is the victim isn't he obligated to distance himself from this case? So going to hr house to arrest her on his down time would be misuse of his authority. 

I'll just screenshot this and send it as proof of intent if the driver needs it in their countersuit."
