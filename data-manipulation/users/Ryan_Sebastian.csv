Its funny how you talk about humans transcending the basic instinct barrier yet you still playing and thinking others are playing the I told you so im right you’re wrong game. 

Im just going by the basic creation of life on earth, humans SEEM to get over basic instinct in large tribes and for possible outcome of two marshmallows but not when all marshmallows are in danger. Its not human nature, its just nature. The delusional are you youngins, who think humans can be more peaceful than a tiger yet no tiger has ever done the harm humans have done."

And this evolutionary principle is bigger badder and madder than ever, just because the tribes have gotten HUGE (countries) we think the world can be at peace. This is an illusion that anyone born after WW2 believes. WW3 will happen its a matter of when and its the same players so really there is no such thing as WW1-2 and cold. Its just one huge WW once the weapons allowed it and it will continued until the end of time after this long Nuclear break.

Edit: i guess its too late but Id really would have loved more replies to this. Are these emotional downvotes or do you guys have a rationale to think humans divided into countries aggressively looking out for the interests of their people are not going to war ever again?"

I noticed that since in Canada you can enter bars at 18-19, you get down to 16 sneaking into bars with fake ID, this makes 25 and older fizzle out of the bar scene as going to clubs and bars with 16-19 year olds is absolute trash and retarded. 

In the US 21 and they are extremely serious about ID, you get people that keep going to bars and clubs well into their 30s and 40s, 21-22 are somewhat trashy but not as horrible and smelly as 16-19 year olds. Something I noticed living in both countries.

I find those 3 years really allowed the US to create an elegant nightlife scene that is profitable and doable well into old age, in Canada its fucking kindergarten with their dumb fights and what not."
