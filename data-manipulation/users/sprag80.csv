Nietzsche,ffn2qa7,t1_ffkly9o,1580061376.0,"I came to Nietzsche through Walter Kaufman’s masterpiece. Professor Kaufman was a gifted  writer and he made Nietzsche, among other existentialist poets and thinkers, come alive. That great man died much too young."
Nietzsche,ffidrx8,t3_ets2s3,1579971461.0,Look for books about Nietzsche by the late Robert C. Solomon. Professor Solomon was an excellent writer and deeply understood Nietzsche’s place among philosophical thinkers and movements.
Lovecraft,ffib4d4,t3_etopok,1579969654.0,I love your realistic rendering of everyone’s favorite Old One. I hate it when a jacked Cthulhu looks like he’s been living at a gym in deep R’lyeh.

Nietzsche,ffdxe1j,t3_et09kd,1579831295.0,"Superb exegesis. You have provided, in my view, the definitive analysis of whether Nietzsche was a proto-National Socialist. He was not. Again, outstanding submission."

Scarymovies,ffd9f16,t3_esnngc,1579816012.0,"Wonderful horror. It Follows on the beach. The tension builds beautifully. Also, the horror trash and human remains were almost tactile in their ickiness. 

I would not have had the It Follows assailant run at the victim. Instead, I would have had the It Follows attacker right behind the victim for a climactic jump scare with the camera panning from the killer’s face, the knife and the victim’s face. Also, I would have changed the music for something more startling in the kill scene. 

You and your crew did a great job. I loved it."

Nietzsche,ff3uk7e,t1_ff3jsuz,1579549168.0,"I’m not saying Nietzsche is a dime store Randian. He is simply misread as one. I call these misreaders, Vulgar Nietzscheans. The Nazis were prototypical Vulgar Nietzscheans. Ironically, Nietzsche had more to fear from his socially insecure, herd obsessed disciples than his detractors."

horrorlit,ff356ix,t3_erddjj,1579533941.0,"I absolutely agree. The book combined sex and horror beautifully. To this day, ""Hell House"" remains my favorite haunted house novel. And Matheson realized, like Jackson before him, that it's the people who are  haunted as opposed to the house. I would love to see a hard ""R"" rated remake."
Nietzsche,ff2myf5,t1_ff295zg,1579514022.0,"You give solid reasons for Nietzsche’s mass appeal. Nietzsche also reads like a self-help advocate - - one who makes the insecure reader feel special, powerful and above the herd.  Nietzsche massages the reader’s ego. And to the younger,more impressionable reader, there’s a John Galt “Atlas Shrugged” dynamic. God is dead but not my ego lives on in all its glory. At least until I became old, sick and infirm."
Scarymovies,ff1wupj,t3_er5dp7,1579488007.0,"Very well done short horror. I loved the score and sound effects on my headphones. Also, the story was interesting and immersive. The film had a “Lights Out!” vibe.  Again, great job!"

atheism,fe1f9ir,t3_enh9yz,1578825907.0,"Most atheists are not against religion per se. Rather, we oppose with all our hearts and minds religion that brings war, crime, violence, xenophobia, and an anti-human and anti- science mind set. It’s the consequences of some politicized religions we abhor. I honestly don’t care if my dentist is a liberal Episcopalian. I do care if she’s an Evangelical Christian who embraces theocratic fascism and despises facts, evidence, science and all things secular."

MorbidReality,fdfmd47,t1_fdfligq,1578365038.0,I just ordered my copy on Amazon. I hope my edition tells me what parts the Soviets censored. The Ponary Diary is controversial in Lithuania because the book demonstrates the deep and far reaching Lithuanian compliance in the Holocaust. How else could the Nazis have slaughtered over 90% of Lithuania’s Jews?
MorbidReality,fdfkc1a,t1_fdfk1x3,1578363711.0,I find I have to limit my reading of Holocaust literature. I was worn down after reading Ponary Diary. But I’ll purchase the Kuznetsov book and read it this Spring. Thanks for the referral.

MorbidReality,fdfjp1i,t3_ekwjpc,1578363294.0,"I just finished the chilling “Ponary Diary 1941-1943, A Bystander’s Account,” which is one man’s (Polish)  diary of the execution of thousands of Jews, Poles and Resistance members at an abandoned Russian air base in Lithuania. What struck me about the detailed account was that many of the willing executioners were Lithuanians. Also, the casual sadism was stomach churning. For example, if an intended victim tried to escape, the Lithuanian guards would shoot to wound  the fleeing individual so the victim would then have to crawl back to the execution pit as opposed to the guards having to drag back a dead body for burial in the mass grave. I fucking hate Nazis, anti-semites and anti-semitism."
