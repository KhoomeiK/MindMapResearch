Nothing to worry about, in my opinion, it’s not really any different than seeing a bird or a deer.   

I’d say they don’t like to be noticed, as they are very adept at avoiding being seen or photographed.  They’re quick, real quick, but they’re not infallible.  They’re just another being going about its business that might regard you with some curiosity but is otherwise indifferent."
