AskReddit,fcb66i8,t1_fcab79a,1577582878.0,"Hey, I don't wanna lie to you, so im gonna give it to you straight. It's statistically highly likely that you're a completely average person. You've probably never had an interesting insight or original thought in your life. You probably have a very tedious and unimportant job and you'll likely never make more than five figures. Your impact on the world will be nonexistent and it frankly makes no real difference to anything whether you live or die. None of your work is significant and you'll never come close to being one of the few wealthy or powerful people who mattered.

Sorry, just being harshly honest with you."
CatastrophicFailure,fca2yft,t1_fca0f0b,1577562312.0,Hahaaha - I love encountering weak-minded people like you. The world is filled with horrors and injustices yet your tiny little brain fixates on the welfare of chickens instead.

Scotland has about a tenth the population of England and less than 9% of the wealth of the UK.

Scotland does not give more than it takes. This is a common outright myth peddalled by Nats - have a look at the boring facts [here](http://chokkablog.blogspot.com/2019/12/how-much-of-scotlands-tax-revenue-does.html).

The tories don't give a fuck if you leave and become a poverty-stricken little micronation with the worst budget deficit in the whole of Europe and the highest rate of drugs deaths, mate. Go ahead and fuck off and become a haggis and kilt theme park for tourists - it'll be your only source of national income now that the oil is gone and the carbon free future is on the way. The whole of Scotland is about the size of a single medium Chinese city - and a hell of a lot less productive or innovative. Enioy those hard truths whilst you're waving your tartan nationalism around."
pics,fc2kujm,t1_fc2cpq1,1577365227.0,"Well it doesn't much matter what your imagined ""facts"" are -  I'm sure you share Jeremy's amusing view that you ""won the argument"" - given that for at least five and probably the next ten years the Conservatives will hold power. Shame that the usual labour lies about ""24 hours to save our NHS!"" didn't work with the electorate this time around - guess they've got bored of that tedious scare tactic.

There are huge problems with how we fund and provide health care and social care - tackling them will be extremely complex and difficult. It is not helped at all by the weird way we venerate the NHS as some sort of national religion. Other countries with socialised medicine that is far better than ours do not do this - rather they tend to treat it as a technical matter. The NHS is sclerotic, huge over-managed, terrible at long term planning, awful at adopting technology, and dreadful at joining up its services. It is not the ""envy of the world"" - European health care services are usually far better.  There is definitely an argument for more and better structured funding - and that's the direction we're heading - but there is also a need for far-reaching structural and managerial reform of the service. Without reform, additional funding is just pissed up against the wall and wasted on salary bloat and swelling the management ranks - with little to no improvement in front line services. 

Sadly, it will always be ridiculously hard to do anything sensible with the NHS because the moment anyone attempts anything there is hysteria on the left about selling off ""our NHS"" to the children of Donald trump or some other fantasy nonsense."
pics,fc1qv0r,t1_fc0ylp9,1577326835.0,"Everything you've said is either a deliberate lie, or you're a moron. The budget remorselessly increases every year. The tories have been in power for most of the NHS's existence - if they really wanted it ""torn up"" then they're doing a spectacularly bad job of realising their goals - they've had over forty years in charge of the NHS to get it done and it's still here. Jesus christ, I can never figure out if reddit leftists actually believe the hysterical nonsense they spread, or they know it's a lie but don't care because they figure it helps their political narrative."
