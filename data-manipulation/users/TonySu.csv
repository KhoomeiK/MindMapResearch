To me the most interesting is Milton Friedman's negative income tax, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative\_income\_tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax). This is a composite basic income and flat tax system. An example is given

* $30,000 tax deduction
* 50% flat tax rate
* Negative tax value results in subsidy

Then if you

* Earn $0, you pay no tax and get $15,000 in subsidy
* Earn $20,000, you pay no tax and get $5000 in subsidy
* Earn $50,000, you pay $10,000 in tax, equal to 20%
* Earn $100,000 you pay $35,000 in tax, equal to 35%

So this flat tax is effectively a progressive tax, the key point is that the system is transparent and simple. You either tweak the deduction or you tweak the tax rate, there's no other exemptions in which you can hide loopholes."

Fundamentally growth and dividends come from the same place, a company's profits after operating expenses. So one way for the growth to occur is for the company to have a fat bank balance, shareholders have partial ownership of this bank balance so their share value rises. Another way that is more common, is share buybacks and issuing of stock options. The company buys back a certain amount of shares, then issues options to executives for 20% of the market price. That means they took profits belonging to shareholders, bought something to resell to executives for 20% of the value. That's an enormous waste of shareholder value.

The other common situation is that the bank balance encourages the company to take unnecessary risks. With a lean balance sheet the company might operate in a more careful manner, with a fatter balance sheet they might be more inclined to make risky acquisitions or otherwise waste shareholder profits. This is evidenced by many high profile failed acquisitions in the US tech sector. Apple on the other hand is just holding onto an enormous cash balance that's generating very little income and similarly being inefficient, but at least they aren't losing it.

So evaluating a stock based on whether is ""dividend"" or ""growth"" is misguided, it all depends on context. CSL for example is a global pharmaceutical company, it makes sense for them to invest in growing their business, they need to be constantly spending on new research and the nature of their industry allows them to keep growing. Telstra on the other hand was a local telecommunications monopoly, do they really have much chance to grow their business in any meaningful way in Australia? It makes sense for Telstra to just sit on their monopoly and count their money with their investors, the same could be said for CBA.

Ultimately the cash-reserve-inefficiency factor could outweigh the tax-efficiency factor in the broader market, the only way to tell is to crunch the numbers. But simply reasoning that growth stocks are more tax efficient is not enough to suggest better returns."
