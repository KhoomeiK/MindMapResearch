Dexter,ffdlats,t1_ffddd89,1579823296.0,"That was why I didn’t like Season 4. I found it very annoying and stressful to watch the scenes where Dexter has to juggle family life and killing. It was great acting but made me feel tense. Rita got on my nerves as well. I also just didn’t find Trinity as interesting as most people did. Sure, Season 4 is better than Season 5, Season 6, Season 7 and Season 8 for sure, but I don’t consider it better than Season 1, Season 2 or Season 3. 

I thought the Prado family was amazing and Jimmy Smitts played Miguel brilliantly. I loved all the little side plots, too. Kept it fresh and interesting. I also liked how the end of the season tied everything in with The Skinner ultimately as well. I thought The Skinner was a badass villain. Maybe it’s just me. I also liked Anton as a character, I know he appears in Season 4, too, but I liked him better in Season 3. I also liked Lundy a LOT more in Season 2 over Season 4. I honestly didn’t like how he was brought back for Season 4. Season 2 is very, very close behind Season 3 as my favorite season, with Season 1 obviously after it. But there’s just something about Season 3 that I really love. I also loved the whole idea of Dexter learning he can’t have a kill partner or best friend if you will, and I love how he got married and was having a kid shortly when the season ended. To me, it showed what Harry taught Dexter to do all along. Appear normal, which he did, he got a wife and had a baby on the way, he had a good job, he appeared normal to the outside still. I didn’t like how Deb found out who he was in later seasons and the whole she loves him thing, I didn’t like how Hannah was used a character, etc. I liked the Dexter Morgan of the first 3 seasons. It’s why I got into the show in the first place, because I liked that he was hiding in plain sight and it could be believable, how the show was. In later seasons the show just got very unrealistic and suffered poor writing and many other things. A lot of people say that the show should have ended with Season 4, or even Season 2, I’ve seen many people say. Idk. Season 3 is when it should have ended IMO."
Dexter,ffcz4gm,t3_eswbdc,1579810244.0,"I also just remembered the epic moment when it pretended like Dexter destroyed his work station and screamed ‘’Miguel!!!’’ after he found out he was being used by him the whole time. Jimmy was fantastic as Miguel. So many great moments with him that he really made great by his acting abilities. 

The Skinner is also super underrated in the Dexter series. He actually came pretty close to killing Dexter. I know Dexter broke free by knocking over the table and breaking his wrist to get out of the knot but he did kidnap Dexter and he did not see it coming. Could have easily killed him after that. He probably could have to if he didn’t talk with Dexter and go back to get his tools. I mean the whole show could be interpreted in that way that any killer in the series COULD have killed Dexter but George King was pretty smart. His background story was kind of cool as well. I’ve never seen that on a show before. 

But yeah ultimately it was just a great season and it’s underrated. I’ve never heard anyone say it sucks, in fact people say they liked it, it’s just sandwiched in between Season 2 and Season 4 so it’s overlooked."
dxm,fehomog,t1_fegnam2,1579120776.0,Makes sense. I like Delsym cuz it’s poli and the afterglow lasts forever. I guess for people who love hbR it makes more sense
dxm,fefhtlg,t3_eoq9tj,1579056618.0,I used Robocough when it first came out and a few other times since. Didn’t like it as much as good old Delsym or Robogels. Don’t see why it’s so popular honestly. But they have no reason to pull it.
dxm,feej29t,t3_eohv68,1579034759.0,The only thing I do is make sure my portable speaker is charged up because I love to lay in the dark in my bed and listen to music like 99.% of DXM users. Other than that I make sure I have a water bottle next to me or some kind of drink maybe a soda or something cuz sometimes my mouth gets dry af. And that’s about it.
Dexter,feebq65,t3_emv6bb,1579030475.0,"The time to stop watching would have been after Season 4 if you listen to all the people who say the show sucked after Season 4. But personally, I think each season is pretty good, except for some of Season 8. I’d say definitely keep watching until the end, why not? A lot of people have Season 5, Season 6, Season 7, but those were all pretty good to me. Like I said, Season 8 has some shit moments but it’s still worth watching."
dxm,feeb8ku,t3_eofj4i,1579030188.0,I haven’t done poli for the longest time until last night. Chugged a 5oz bottle of the orange flavor. Gave me a crazy ass trip. Idk why everyone hates poli. It’s not that bad. It’s so different than hbR to me that it’s almost a different trip entirely. And I’m still pretty high today which is awesome.
LinkinPark,fdlr1t2,t3_elyotg,1578530454.0,I hate the album. So weird and boring to me. No real songs they sound more like all interludes or segments. It’s weird. MTM was their last good effort.
SuicideWatch,fdhyona,t3_elfogn,1578432569.0,Music has always been the one constant that has saved me since I was first suicidal at like age 15. But lately I am in the same boat. I can’t even listen to music anymore in my car which was always something that really helped me in life. Playing it at home sucks for the most part. And it doesn’t make me as happy as it once did. So it fucking sucks. Oh well I guess right. One last thing that I have to give up in life.
SuicideWatch,fdhyean,t3_elhp39,1578432422.0,"I’m 29 too and my Mom just pointed out to me that I’m a loser at 29 with no job and basically just a failure at life. 29 seems old but is it really? It’s not that old. You still have time to make something out of yourself. You can start a family, become rich, anything. It’s just if the depression or not will allow it. Mine won’t."
SuicideWatch,fdhxxzw,t3_elewpp,1578432178.0,"Yes. Because I could have saved myself years and years of misery if I did. My family wouldn’t hate me as much as they do now also because I wouldn’t have ruined their image of me. When I was like 16, I put a gun in my mouth in my basement and thought about it for a minute. Didn’t do it obviously. Would have been a good time to go probably."
unpopularopinion,fdhumc2,t3_el4vpj,1578430435.0,"Yeah they were. They aren’t as cringe worthy as say Nickelback, but they def were bad. I actually enjoyed their Significant Other CD back when I was way younger (this was like 5th Grade in 2000) and I even had the poster of the album cover on my wall. But yeah, I was in 5th grade. Never listened to anything else from them because it sucks. Let’s also put it this way, if I were driving around and playing Limp Bizkit loudly, that would probably be the most cringe worthy thing ever done."
unpopularopinion,fdhuamu,t3_ekoubn,1578430273.0,I agree they are. So gross. Especially those Cardi B style ones. Makes me want to puke.
unpopularopinion,fdhtzq7,t3_el1lhb,1578430119.0,"I loved it when I originally watched the entire series back in 2013. However, I have attempted watching it again recently and I’m not sure why I loved it so much. The acting is good, yeah. The cinematography is good. But it just was too boring for me. I didn’t like the El Camino movie either. I’ve been watching Dexter again after last watching the series in 2013 and I quite frankly think it was a better series by far at this point. Don’t care what anyone says."
unpopularopinion,fdhtlzi,t3_el8hi9,1578429930.0,100% fully agree. Just thinking of it makes me shudder. And it’s also why I no longer eat popsicles in general and haven’t since I was young.
unpopularopinion,fdhtgxx,t3_el77oc,1578429863.0,I hate it too. Don’t find it attractive on a women at all. Usually the types that wear it are those ultra feminist types cuz they know men hate it. Lipstick in general to me is disgusting looking anyways but red is just the worst.
unpopularopinion,fdht996,t3_elavc5,1578429747.0,Fuck this opinion. Lol. The smell alone after someone uses the bathroom is nasty. The warm toilet seat is disgusting. What kind of animal agrees with this opinion anyways?
unpopularopinion,fdht2z0,t3_elh9b6,1578429651.0,"Nintendo in general sucks. Always hated it. Back when I was a kid in the 90’s I legit only played my Sega Genesis and then eventually PS1. Crash Bandicoot could kick the shit out of Mario too, btw."
unpopularopinion,fdhsy2y,t3_elbmo1,1578429577.0,No they’re not. They’re generic mainstream garbage. The sound sucks. I hate that faux grunge 90’s rock sound. So cringe worthy. Anyone who likes it is probably a boring ass person.
unpopularopinion,fdhseew,t3_elcchw,1578429270.0,Taking a piss in public to me doesn’t bother me at all. Don’t care how nasty the bathroom is because I don’t touch anything at all except my dick. All touch free. Taking a shit is different. Don’t like to unless I have to.
unpopularopinion,fdhrv8h,t3_elc1xz,1578428964.0,"I have been to tons and tons of concerts in my life, a lot of big name artists too, and a lot of lesser known artists. But I honestly agree with you nowadays. I don’t know why I ever enjoyed it so much. The sound always sucks compared to listening at home. Some say bands are better live because they change up the songs and stuff. Which is why I can listen to live recordings at home and it’s just as good if not better. I hate all the people at shows. I hate walking and standing on my feet for an entire day when I can relax at home and listen to the same thing, without irritating people. The pot smoke was always very annoying too, not to mention the drunken idiots. I’m not against having some drinks and listening to music but I don’t act like douche when I do like most of these guys at concerts do. It’s also super expensive even for smaller artists nowadays and you have to factor in gas and everything for driving unless you live directly next to a huge venue."
unpopularopinion,fdhr6p7,t3_eleb5r,1578428570.0,"I agree so much. In my city, the UPS drivers are assholes, honestly. They stop in the middle of the road, impeding traffic, pull out into oncoming traffic whenever they feel like it, almost causing accidents, etc. As a matter of fact I think about a month ago one did that and got in a bad accident with an old lady who had to go to the hospital. They also speed at all times and seem to not care about anything in terms of rules on the road or anything. Then when they deliver stuff half the time they just throw it wherever. I had a vinyl album delivered a year or two ago and it was thrown in a snow bank next to my steps that were clearly shoveled and salted."
unpopularopinion,fdhqsh2,t3_elfcn3,1578428343.0,I honestly love my pair of black Crocs and I don’t care what literally anyone in public or elsewhere thinks about me wearing them. They’re comfy as hell and I have wide feet and they really are great for them. I see people wearing flip flops and slides all the time but yet somehow I’m not allowed to wear Crocs? Ok.
unpopularopinion,fdhqmu7,t3_elde3m,1578428251.0,"I’m a grown man and still love having fun and enjoy things that I did when I was younger. Don’t care what anyone thinks. I don’t want children and don’t want a wife. Not against anyone who does but it’s just not for me and that’s fine. I don’t care if people think I have to fit into some perfect mature person idea that society expects. As cliche as it sounds, you only have one life and I’d rather spend it having fun and spending time with people that I want to be around."
unpopularopinion,fdhqawb,t3_ele4i8,1578428058.0,"As someone who owned every big gaming system growing up, I never played my Nintendo products, like ever. I was way more into Sega Genesis and PS1 when I was little and then PS2. I think the only game that I really enjoyed on a Nintendo product was Resident Evil 4 on GameCube but it was then eventually made for other platforms anyways."
unpopularopinion,fdhq4xa,t3_elfhje,1578427958.0,I’m a huge horror fan and have seen the entire series and the only one that I mildly enjoyed was Saw 2. There didn’t need to be as many as there was and every single film besides Saw 2 was just immensely boring to me.
unpopularopinion,fdhpzz6,t3_elfsc9,1578427876.0,I agree fully. I always give new music a chance from any artist that I enjoy. Sometimes I enjoy a few of the songs a lot. People just don’t give anything a chance anymore. It’s annoying when people also act like bands broke up after they stopped liking their music and write off anything they have done since
unpopularopinion,fdhphho,t3_el6xtr,1578427570.0,"I love in western Massachusetts and the winters here are BRUTAL. So I kind of wish I lived in a warm climate year round, honestly, after dealing with these winters my whole life. Problem is all of my family live here and friends and I wouldn’t want to leave all of them behind just for a warmer climate. But if you ask me, warmer is better. The summers and late springs here are pretty nice though."
unpopularopinion,fdhp93q,t3_elcf8p,1578427429.0,Any kind of pornographic image without the persons face is shit. Doesn’t work for me at all. Besides I’m more into eyes and legs over just nice tits.
unpopularopinion,fdhp4u5,t3_elc6d6,1578427358.0,Of course they shouldn’t. Why is it an unpopular opinion? Anyone who can’t even afford to take care of themselves shouldn’t be having a child.
SuicideWatch,fcthsvc,t3_eiltmv,1577943741.0,"Not going to be one of those people who says ‘’it’s only 1 day into 2020’’. Honestly an entire year can be ruined by a single day, I know that feeling. I’m sorry for what you are going through. There is always next year. Who knows. Don’t want to preach but just try to get by despite everything. Find someone that makes you happy even if it’s something simple as hell like a video game or TV show."
SuicideWatch,fcthkd4,t3_eis4q9,1577943510.0,Every ex I have had (have had 4 major ones) all have kids and a few are married. All my old friends are succeeding in life big time. I’m the loser. Haven’t talked to any in years because of my severe depression and they haven’t reached out because none of them actually ever cared about me. Find something to live for. Whether it be a family member or a video game or music or anything. Literally anything. I’m not gonna try and preach to you that life is amazing
SuicideWatch,fcpgosz,t3_ei4k2u,1577863223.0,"The only thing that is keeping me going has been my Mom and that’s been since like 2013. At the very end of 2012 me and my long time girlfriend broke up and I haven’t had a girlfriend since, or a job, or friends. I gave up on life at that point and just started hanging out with my Mom every single day and night. And it’s been that way ever since, and it’s now 2020. I don’t care about anyone else in my family or what they would think of me not being here."
SuicideWatch,fcpg14f,t3_eias2z,1577862363.0,"Haha I didn’t receive even one. Hung out with my Mom tonight like usual and she didn’t even say happy new year despite watching the ball drop on TV. Usually I will get a text from my brother, sister, Grandmother, etc. Not even that this year. Haha. This year is sending me a sign."
SuicideWatch,fcpfyhj,t3_eieayu,1577862270.0,I wish I was. It especially sucks because I know how much shit this new decade is going to bring. Already worried about it.
