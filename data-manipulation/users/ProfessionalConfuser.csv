EngineeringStudents,ffcarem,t3_esufum,1579795391.0,"Maybe we should add a sally port to the gate. If you aren't passionate about engineering and you don't have a really strong internal drive to plow through things that are difficult and time-consuming for future rewards, then you shouldn't go into engineering. How is that?   


All I can say from my side of the equation is that I see a lot of folks that aren't passionate and aren't committed to delayed gratification make sub-optimal choices about how they approach schoolwork. As such, a significant number of them drop out of the pipeline - after investing 2-3 years and some non-zero amount of money.   


If you can keep your eyes on the brass ring as you grind out the coursework and ancillary stuff then you'll probably do OK, even if you aren't 'into it'."

EngineeringStudents,fdkd2i1,t3_eltlit,1578501312.0,"I think I get your question, but I'm not totally sure. 

Typically the reference point is arbitrary. The only 'true' point of zero potential energy is when the charges are separated by 'infinity' so they cannot do work on each other. 

In practice, since all you measure are changes in potentials, then it really doesn't matter if it is an absolute zero or just a convenient zero. Your 9-Volt parallel plate capacitor has one terminal labeled as +9 and the other as zero, but really, one terminal is at +4.5 V and the other is at -4.5 V. The difference is 9 V and that is all that matters. Each coulomb of charge can receive 9 Joules of energy from the electric field.  


Or, I might have completely misunderstood your question."

But - there are easier ways to get a pragmatic career: Accounting, for example. That is a fast track to income and has much lower barriers to entry.   My plumber makes quite a nice living. So does my friend who is an electrician. 

I guess my point was more about the persistence in engineering...it is not an easy road by any means. I wouldn't encourage people to enter medical school just because it might be lucrative. You need something more than the prospect of a paycheck to power you through the really tough stuff. If not passion, at least a deep seated interest."
