OldSchoolCool,ffjzca7,t1_ffjgwtn,1580011122.0,"Most of the time the people talking about ""no shit, there I was..."" probably didn't do anything. Honestly, the better stories people actually want to hear are the stories of you and your buddies fucking around. Nobody really wants to hear about guilt or trauma you're holding onto because it's awkward and people don't want to respond to it. And frankly, for some people even if they experienced something traumatic, it doesn't really matter. Tons of people I know joke around about getting mortars because who cares. But civilians don't get why it's funny so."

todayilearned,ffcd4r5,t1_ffc57rp,1579796879.0,I'm not concerned.
todayilearned,ffa4289,t1_ffa387q,1579727468.0,Don't because it's not anything worth anybody's time...? Nobody has to prove how masculine they are.

explainlikeimfive,ff7eu9d,t1_ff7cf9l,1579647916.0,"Oof. Ya got me. Pretty much actually. I'm a very in my head person which makes things about 1000x worse sometimes. So I can logically tell myself ""there's nothing to panic about"" which will make me more upset because then I'm telling myself I'm being illogical. But I can stop hiccuping on command so at least I have that."
explainlikeimfive,ff75b9x,t1_ff6qqhc,1579641416.0,"It's not terribly difficult to do for an average person tbh. Of course self immolation is something different, but basic pain or discomfort you can do it. Your brain and body is capable of a lot. If you live up North for example and walk outside in the cold...just don't be. Tell yourself you're warm. Now I can't keep it rolling for a LONG time, but it helps. I've done a ~6mile hike through mountains before on a broken leg by telling myself that I was good and forcing myself to forget it. If I could only figure out how to do this for my debilitating anxiety..."

funny,ff4sld8,t1_ff4nxhk,1579571445.0,"I would advise against it. Might have gone over okay back in the day. You would have to be incredibly good looking or charismatic for this to have any resemblance of good response now and at that point, why bother with a corny card that implies lack of consent."

GetMotivated,fetk092,t1_fetamd5,1579376189.0,"I did the same thing! Was at college and decided I didn't know what I wanted to do but didn't want to waste time and money at college figuring it out. Figured basic training was productive. Not that GI Bill is hitting a certain type of way. Just went over my degree plan last night and realized I only have a full year of classes (plus 2 more classes) and I will be done. I never thought I would get there, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel."

I definitely get pretty bad seasonal depression but I manage it with a good therapist. Some people say tanning salons can help. I will say this, I'm moving south again as soon as I finish school."

Oh my God yes. And then I always want to diminish what I say too. ""I don't know, I was just thinking..."" I've mostly gotten past it, but when I am around people who I haven't worked TIRELESSLY to prove myself to, I want to revert. I worked in the background for a long time trying to prove myself to my male leadership and colleagues before I would allow myself to speak. And it sucks but it was necessary because in a male dominated field like mine, it literally took me a year before anyone took me seriously. Now I'm on the brink of a career change to another male dominated field and I have this insane anxiety because every woman I have talked to in this field has switched jobs several times because of toxic people and not being taken seriously as young attractive female professionals. They were just seen as objects. But if they were unattractive, they wouldn't have had the time of day. Lose-lose. I still want to do it because I love statistics, but I'm so nervous about having to start from the ground again."
funny,fef4j9w,t1_feeplc4,1579048003.0,It's not specifically an immigrant thing of course. It's just more common because we don't typically do that in America and it's way more common other places.
funny,feenrfm,t1_feene57,1579037482.0,Yeah? A lot of places still have septic and are very cautious. Even lots of people who have upgraded from septic still do it out of habit. Go to...just about any immigrant family house. Almost all of them that I have gone to still do that.

weddingplanning,fe9scl1,t3_eo5d7b,1578941025.0,Expect plenty of people who RSVPd Yes and didn't say anything else to not come as well. We had an entire table except 2 people flake. So they were sitting alone. We told them they could move but they decided they were cool with it anyway.
askscience,fe9c6bf,t1_fe7l4g5,1578936258.0,"My husband and I were both in the military. I thought he was just crude and frankly I was nervous for a while that certain things didn't even bother him a little bit while there are frankly to this day things that I can't not think about. Not like PTSD, but definitely a lot of guilt. And yet he just says ""eh, war is war. Shit happens."" It definitely took talking through it in couples therapy for me to not be so bothered by it anymore that it's so nonchalant. But some things just don't have any effect on people whatsoever. It's not that he's not an empathetic person. He absolutely is, I just took a long time to come around that he doesn't HAVE to be upset and dwell on things in order to be a good person."

He's the only reason I have had doctors listen to me. I don't like going in even if I have a very serious issue because I'm afraid they won't listen anyway, but to have an advocate that doesn't mind dressing them down and saying ""look, I live with her. I have seen this. I believe her."" is my saving grace. Thanks for what you do!"
aww,fc5o85u,t1_fc5kt0j,1577462507.0,Alternatively mom had him really young. It sounds like there's much younger children around. Would make much more sense.
