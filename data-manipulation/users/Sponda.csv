AmItheAsshole,ffbcoeb,t1_ffa2fhw,1579759809.0,"You seem like the type of bully who gets off on feeling morally superior at the expense of others. You don't have to punch to be a bully, and this is a common route for emotional bullies."
AmItheAsshole,ffbcbvs,t3_eshzue,1579759432.0,"YTA. By and large. She was trying to confide in you about the source of her desire to bully others and express regret and you just turned it into an ""I'm better than you you suck"". Jesus, dude. Then you call her a bully, not because she was BEING a bully but because you knew it was a sensitive bit for her and you just wanted to hurt her. You fucking bully.

I guess that second to last paragraph was a lie, wasn't it?"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff98ifm,t3_esc0ix,1579707297.0,"""I like girls of all ages, but females my age are so slutty they drive me to like kids"" rings surprisingly similar to ""I find myself center leaning usually, but the people on the left are so PC they just keep driving me to the right""  


Come on, man. You were never trying to go for a girl your age ever."
howtonotgiveafuck,ff41ovs,t3_er9wgv,1579553616.0,"Easily said, but when the people judging the fish are the fish's parents (and they spend 18 years with them in this anthropomorphized tale), it becomes a fair bit harder to be like that fish."
AskReddit,feiomhn,t3_epd482,1579143407.0,"The name of the game is situational awareness. Some things are okay at some times, but TERRIBLE at others. Take note of your surroundings and act accordingly. Being yourself doesn't mean just doing you no matter what is going on around you. It's be genuine and be aware of your surroundings and your crowd and adjust accordingly!"

absolver,fcu9g3p,t1_fctzwra,1577975686.0,"If you're boring or cheesy, you're not fun. Most of us play to have fun. That's probably why people are leaving fights with you."

todayilearned,fck6653,t1_fck5ugz,1577717700.0,"Dublin was owned by vikings at the time. They didn't COME anywhere, the irish vikings just started enslaving people. And some groups ARE better than others. There are usually laws for how you have to treat slaves. Black slaves in america had zero laws protecting them. Irish INDENTURED SERVANTS (not slaves) had human rights. If an indentured servant had a kid, the kid was free. If you had a black slave, you could rape them every day and all of their kids would be your slaves. Look up ""Chattel slavery"" It's different than normal slavery and it's WAY worse. ""Slavery is slavery"" lol. I don't know you, but if i had to take a wild guess, I'd say you were pretty melanin deficient."
todayilearned,fck5k61,t1_fck39xl,1577717216.0,Your article is about the irish enslaving others. Did you even read it?
todayilearned,fcfr8l0,t1_fcc58tc,1577632953.0,I get SOOO pissed off when people claim italians or irish were slaves. They were not slaves. You couldn't rape an irish wife in front of an irishman and force him to watch on pain of death if he looks away. Chattel slavery was a whole different and much more evil beast.
Instantregret,fc9pws5,t1_fc9nwq1,1577556412.0,Do you agree that you're now moving the goalposts since you've been called out on your behavior?
Instantregret,fc9lfso,t1_fc9l98w,1577554429.0,"I'm not attacking you at all. I'm attacking your argument and the words you have said. It's hilarious that you tried to turn it into an ad hominem fallacy so you could feel like you're still in the right and the victor while ignoring every point I made, though."
wowthanksimcured,fc9kjvh,t1_fc9e8n6,1577554031.0,"It's simple for everyone. Fucking hard, but very simple."
Instantregret,fc9jzh5,t1_fc9iww1,1577553790.0,"No, that's not the point you were making, or possibly you're unintentionally displaying a different point, but your comment history proves a bias against black people and your use of the term ""race baiting"" kind of reinforces that. I've read all of your comments and you're SO intent on making the black person the villain, NOT pointing out that a lack of context means nothing can be proved. You've been saying that the black person is the villain based SOLELY on the fact that he pushed the white person before the video started like that's proof and then demanding proof otherwise before claiming victory. You are wrong because you can't make that point any more than you can make a point in the opposite direction."
Instantregret,fc9i9lv,t1_fc8i3uf,1577553071.0,"You can't tell from this video who the bully is. Perhaps the white kid was getting in his face and the black kid pushed him off. The white kid, not used to retaliation, resorts to intimidation (push me again) to try and get the black kid to balk and the black kid doesn't. So the white kid swings. You're REALLY intent on pushing just one narrative like you know that's what it is for sure. It can't be known without further context. Stop trying to swing the narrative in your way just because you made one possible connection."
Nicegirls,fc5yz08,t1_fc5ybe2,1577468753.0,"But it isn't a generalization in ANY colloquial sense. A generalization needs to be broad. So if I said ""people who like dancing are also into scat"", THAT would be a generalization. General MEANS broad (The definition of general is affecting or concerning all or most people, places, or things; widespread). You can't have a small generalization, that honestly sounds like something you just made up to defend your original statement. Plus your whole point was that a generalization can be broad or small(Calling semantics doesn't mean you win when you started it). It cannot."
Nicegirls,fc5xw5t,t1_fc5xrvo,1577468182.0,"That's not a generalization. There's nothing general about that. Some people DO love to suck on liquid poopoo like a gogurt, that's how the scat fetish came about. Not sure you understand your own point, here."
Nicegirls,fc5ukrc,t1_fc5txmv,1577466225.0,"Uhh, generalizations ARE broad. The definition is literally to make a general or broad statement by inferring from specific cases. Which this person is NOT doing here. No such thing as a small generalization."
Nicegirls,fc5td6h,t1_fc5ss34,1577465438.0,"It wasn't THAT broad, she just said ""Some of y'all"". Not ""all"" or even ""most"". This isn't very NiceGirl, it's pointing out the bullshit of saying ""I don't cheat/I stay loyal"" and expecting some sort of cookie for doing the shit you're supposed to do anyway."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fb4muyc,t3_ebelwd,1576511872.0,"Ableism runs wild in this subreddit. I posted a similar picture a little while ago and got stuffed with downvotes and comments saying ""he wasn't bothering anyone by parking in the no parking lines"" despite having to wait 30 minutes to shop because he was parked illegally."
