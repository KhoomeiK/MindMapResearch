However, battery life will be limited. 2 hours max even with a ""new"" battery.

There are some interesting listings in Lazada and Shopee.

Some good models are the T420, T430 for 14-inch screens. For 12 inch screen, either X220 or X230 are good. The higher the number, the more recent the model."
