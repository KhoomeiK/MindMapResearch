LabradorRetrievers,ffh0fah,t3_etknnc,1579919773.0,Give that baby a snuggle! That fur would be so soft...ahh puppy love.
KitchenConfidential,ffgn1qe,t1_ffg82ez,1579910050.0,Exactly. Which makes the gap bigger again.
DIY,fffn4cl,t1_fffe6sd,1579887530.0,Is there an option to build a gate that rolls in sideways  like a rollup storage door would do (vertically instead of horizontally?)
cocktails,fffgwg7,t1_ffe8iy6,1579883700.0,I sadly agree. Canadian woman here who drank a lot of these as a pick-me-up wrestling off the previous nights demons. It was always a white russian with splash of coke and a cherry. Milk preferred over cream. No tequila. Op's photo isn't the smooth transition of different viscosities blending - this is curdled and chunky. Gross.
cocktails,fffg0qx,t3_et58jp,1579883155.0,"We're grooving the same vibe! I just made two marmalades yesterday (one Seville orange, the other grapefruit). My idea was to use the marmalade like a syrup-bitters component to make a sour with lemon juice and egg whites. I would happily drink your cocktail."
food,ffa2a1j,t3_escbz1,1579726448.0,Oh my. I only recently resubbed because of the amount of garbage posted was not pleasant. This looks like real and delicious food.
cats,ff6dmuo,t1_ff6cby9,1579624911.0,"I get where you're coming from. You're probably doing as much as you can with what you have to work with. Remind yourself of that and although it will never be perfect, you and your wife are doing a lot. Big hearts in both of you."
cats,ff6azg3,t1_ff69q22,1579623232.0,"I think the suggestions OP and others mention can give some rest for your thoughts. Also, maybe reach out to the local fire department and get their recommendations. Have a fire plan AND practice it!,  have multiple smoke detecters connected, have multiple extinguishers on site, have backup supplies (food, extra crates, blankets, bottled water, first aid kits) in a location off site (like a shed or storage unit). It's horrible to think about but having a plan could save a lot of lives and heartbreak, both human and furred."
cats,ff4ch32,t1_ff36cfk,1579560375.0,My sister volunteers with a cat shelter. The main foster home and shelter homebase had a house fire last Friday and two cats are still missing (although their location is thought to be known because of snow prints).  I can't imagine the trauma you and your family are going through but am glad to know donations have been given to lessen the financial emergency. I now am the current foster mom of two sister kitties who are still hacking from smoke inhalation. Sending love your way!

AmItheAsshole,fengpdw,t1_fenfww4,1579284310.0,Yes. OP just needs to be honest. Take some time.

londonontario,feedm4r,t3_eoo0cm,1579031577.0,"Did you pay January rent? 

I get that you didn't give a deposit when you signed your lease (and that is fine), but that means you have to pay your rent every month, including the last month you are living there."
OutOfTheLoop,fe52mo6,t1_fe518fd,1578865105.0,Ahhh. Right you are.
OutOfTheLoop,fe4x7av,t3_enoa5i,1578863641.0,Answer: not sure but Brad Pitt's character in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood wears a t-shirt with the Champion logo on it. The movie is based in the late 60's.
