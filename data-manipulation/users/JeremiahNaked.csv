science,fcvpkmc,t1_fcvop1w,1578007218.0,"""States can choose to provide three ways for voters to cast a ballot before Election Day:

Early Voting: In 39 states and the District of Columbia, any qualified voter may cast a ballot in person during a designated period prior to Election Day. No excuse or justification is required. Two additional states will provide this option in the coming years. 

Absentee Voting: All states will mail an absentee ballot to certain voters who request one. The voter may return the ballot by mail or in person. In 17 states, an excuse is required, while 33 states and the District of Columbia permit any qualified voter to vote absentee without offering an excuse. Some states offer a permanent absentee ballot list: once a voter asks to be added to the list, s/he will automatically receive an absentee ballot for all future elections.

Mail Voting: A ballot is automatically mailed to every eligible voter (no request or application is necessary). In-person voting sites may also be available for voters who would like to vote in-person and to provide additional services to voters. Five states mail ballots to all eligible voters for every election. Other states may provide this option for some types of elections.""
