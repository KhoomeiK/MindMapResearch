PoliticalDiscussion,fgld27r,t3_eywil7,1580891559.0,"Andrew Yang said something along the line of ""impeachment is the right thing to do, but in the same times it won't work"""
YangForPresidentHQ,fglcpo6,t3_eyywzh,1580891074.0,I mean everyone can laugh at this.
facepalm,fgfnj1o,t1_fgfmwvy,1580743351.0,Thanks for explaining. My brain is so dead right now.
facepalm,fgfifzs,t1_fgfhzxj,1580739630.0,Oh ok then. Sometimes people call fetus baby so i got mistaken. But why they talked about abortion then? Did they mean adoption?
YangForPresidentHQ,fgfi5s8,t3_ey6t20,1580739404.0,I would not at all involved in politics if it isn't for Yang.
facepalm,fgfhzxj,t3_ey5802,1580739276.0,6 months are kinda late tho. Abortion will harm both the fetus (obviously) and the mother.
YangForPresidentHQ,fgfhhml,t3_exqlnh,1580738870.0,What a misleading way to represent the data. I would not understand it without reading the text.

unpopularopinion,fgasa5m,t3_exlvav,1580654835.0,I hope i can help him somehow
PoliticalDiscussion,fg8dkjb,t3_exd8zm,1580616372.0,Damn no. Why. I think what you are more worried about here is low information voters.
lifehacks,fg8ddqd,t3_ex9b14,1580616220.0,Because of coronavirus now i proceed to eat everything with chopsticks and no one can ask me to stop.

unpopularopinion,fg5fmog,t3_ewtnl1,1580526171.0,"Nah nah english ain't one of the hardest. Somewhere in the middle, maybe. Would be easier if your alphabet is Latin ish. It takes effort to learn new language anyway, which is always need to be appreciated."

YangForPresidentHQ,fejryrc,t3_eph8ah,1579184376.0,That would be the true diversity.
AskWomen,fejdp4h,t1_feh2bbz,1579168976.0,I appreciate that you express your thoughts here but oh my we have many ideas NOT in common.  Why would you say his climate change plan is not strong? And how do you feel about thorium?
AskWomen,fejdcvl,t1_fej8hba,1579168462.0,"Yang's VAT exclude groceries and other basic need goods so it will be much less regressive than the normal VAT. He mentions several times he definitely don't want to take the money from where there is none. The advantage of VAT is it is effective in getting the tax from big tech companies like Amazon and Google, which found loop holes in the current tax plan and are paying little to $0 in federal tax. At least that's my understanding, after some time researching."
AskWomen,fejd2nt,t3_ep4cv6,1579168027.0,"I have been following him since the later half of last year. Very genuine and funny. He seems to love and care a lot for his family, which is always a plus. Some of his ideas didn't click with me at first but after some time listening and doing research they seems to be lot more rational. He was a longer than long short candidate, but his vision is so great, i feel like i must support him.

Before Yang, I was totally political apathetic and all i heard was ""Trump bad, Hilary better"". Now i get to know there is more than black and white. Pretty sure many Yang supporters share the same sentiment."
