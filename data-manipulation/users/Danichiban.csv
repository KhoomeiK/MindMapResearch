DarkCrystal,ff9i5qd,t1_ff75tuz,1579713530.0,No to mention that the company has a contract to make a new serie for the Muppets. That time schedule isn‚Äôt that big to make me think a season 2 to be in production. :c
DarkCrystal,ff9hsan,t3_erwlgy,1579713301.0,"I was curious too as I want to support this franchise as much as I can. But of what I have seen from the video game...it‚Äôs pretty much the casual run-of-the-mill Tactical RPG. Nothing special. And I‚Äôve been through that since Final fantasy Tactics(Which is a lookalike in so many ways),Nippon Ichi games and of course the Fire Emblem series.

Instead, I‚Äôll stick with the books, I am still missing some. I actually bough a lot of books to be up to date. Since the last time I heard about the Dark Crystal was when they announced the comic book back in what, 2006? So yeah, happy to see a lot of fans here. I am in the few who like Jim‚Äôs work in my circle of friends. Not to mention I started to watch the series early this year. I still have rookie numbers of rewatch. I am watching it German this week. Most of the voices are on point."

That‚Äôs **musk** ladies and gents. And add this to a close confinement center where they all group up. By notable reasons we will smell them and some have stronger smell than others. Which ironically, people think it stinks.

Didn‚Äôt you any of you ever did go to a friends house and the place smelled weird or something? That‚Äôs **their** smell. If you come back after some time you won‚Äôt sniff less or anything. Because your brain impregnated to accept it. 

Since you don‚Äôt know any or most musk that people generate, brain doesn‚Äôt like it.

So in a nutshell; too much, too fast, no like."
DarkCrystal,fdzleau,t1_fdza7o1,1578791315.0,"Of course, they would need a distributor still. Also this is just all blind speculation..without adding assumptions of what I am trying to say.

I know, it‚Äôs farfetched for HBO. But they funded so many other projects it makes it more plausible. Universal Studios wouldn‚Äôt even touch a rebooted project like that even if Jim was still alive.

Netflix has done more than I ever though in this project. Yet, they can discard it pretty easily for season 2. Not having any feedback is driving me crazy and that conclusion more accurate. :/"

DarkCrystal,fdy9x13,t1_fdy2okh,1578777589.0,"No, I am saying that making a production with contract binding in distribution is problematic. You can have smaller parties like BBC or Focus Features without the blackouts. Cost wise, it would‚Äôve ended more like a movie co-production. Laika/Henson would have been a example."
DarkCrystal,fdy0ih2,t1_fdu46ye,1578774764.0,u/Agressive_Dog explains it in the upper comments. It‚Äôs basicly about binding contracts when Netflix does it. Laika would lack money but not having direct rights or making ‚Äúblackouts‚Äù to the distribution of the IP for a new season.
DarkCrystal,fdu38l5,t3_elxadx,1578726738.0,"Even Jim talk about a remake and he wasn‚Äôt for it. He was interviewed a couple of time when the movie bombed he was very clear; prequel and sequel yes, remakes no."

DarkCrystal,fdu20o4,t1_fdqmh8r,1578726108.0,"Hate her as you will...but her character is pretty much the falling of the older, passive order, that was to protect the peace in the Kingdom.

I don‚Äòt know why she would get more punished. She broke the Gelfling traditions by her political messup. She lost her sister partly because of the battle to rescue the other Gelfling. (But personally, why did her sister ran off to finish off the Seskis? She really didn‚Äôt need to do that.) She got humilitied in front of the Skesis and almost died afterward. Sure, they could kill her in season 2...but yeah, ‚Äúspoilers‚Äù, a lotta Gelflings are gonna die either way."
