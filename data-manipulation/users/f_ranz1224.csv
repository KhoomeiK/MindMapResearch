On the last day of that 4 day trip we tried mario. The difference was night and day

We were hooked woth ghostbusters but mario sealed the deal

We wouldnt get a nes until the supernes was out. We were always 1 gen behind. Got the playstation a year before ps2 for example. Got a genesis the year before ps1 came out


Loved it anyway. We didnt have many games so actively borrowed and traded

In most games, refusing rewards gives less loot but gives you light points/paragon points/morality whatever that buffs your stats, augments light powers, or gives access to morally good gear


Here being good pretty much only augments your rep to that person or faction
