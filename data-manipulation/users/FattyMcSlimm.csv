pics,ff55vlj,t1_ff549h5,1579581106.0,"While I agree, take a look at how Ronald Regan enacted the first “modern” gun laws in California as Governor once The Black Panthers started using their 2nd amendment rights to carry weapons. It’s less about “remedying” as it is about opening eyes. Conservatives are totally cool with “their people” (see: White, conservative, and hopefully Christian) having guns but once dark skinned folks exercise that right it becomes...”an issue”.

Full disclosure: gun toting Democratic Socialist.

Edit: Thanks to u/Masterjason13 , I shouldn’t blanket “conservatives” with that brush. “Conservatives” certainly in California and then the rest of the USA at that time(since they adopted those laws) were in agreement with Regan that “more gun laws were needed” after The Black Panther Party armed themselves."

IdiotsInCars,ff559fe,t1_ff4olfa,1579580609.0,"IMO, the issue is some kinda “everyone-but-me” syndrome. Everyone agrees that using their phone while driving is “bad”. The problem comes at time of execution vs the time of witnessing. When we see an idiot, obviously on their phone, we see them swerving and going 10-40% below the speed limit and we think “That person is an asshole, I can’t believe they would use their phone and endanger others for a fucking text/insta/FB, etc.”. 

Then, something switches in our brains when an “important” thing happens and we absentmindedly pull out phones out and do the same. The issue is, we don’t notice that we are slowing down and/or swerving. On top of that, when we get honked at we immediately, angrily, honk back/flip off the honker because “that was an important phone thing” in our world. 

The main thing to remember is that we are but NPCs in virtually everyone else’s world. When NPCs endanger “Our lives” it’s a monster deal but when we endanger NPC’s lives it’s...meh.
