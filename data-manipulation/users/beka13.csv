This sort of thing is pretty common if the kids are friends. I've brought my kids' friends all over the place and they've been brought lots of places.

I don't think you should be expected to cover your ex's kid's activities (is your ex hurting for money that swimming lessons are too expensive?) but I do think you could maybe bring him along for lunch or whatever with your daughters sometimes.
