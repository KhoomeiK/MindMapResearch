relationship_advice,fgjgj40,t3_eyti5x,1580843574.0,It sounds like bacterial vaginosis it says online that ammonia smell comes from an infection so you should definitely tell her she might need to go to the OBgyn.
addiction,fgjezc2,t1_fgje27i,1580842641.0,Definitely sounds like anhedonia don’t worry I thought I would never feel happy again but with the help of supplements I got better in a few monthes! Let me go look at which ones I took and get back to you with some specific names! Don’t worry it really can be cured it’s the brain not producing chemicals from burnout from the drugs.
addiction,fgjd28k,t3_eytyzc,1580841504.0,"Omg! I had this exact same problem really bad after getting off methadone and heroin. Basically it’s something called Anhedonia, the lack of ability to feel pleasure. Music stopped sounding good, nothing could spark that happiness and I was terrified it would never go away. What helped me was taking brain health supplements with certain herbs that help your brain start to produce dopamine again. Things like ginkgo biloba, and this one supplement called Higher thoughts, and a few others. Without the herbs I never would’ve gotten back to feeling cheerful at seeing my houseplants or hearing a new song. Good luck!!"
rareinsults,fgi1sui,t1_fgi1ml2,1580801645.0,"Lol go listen to Billie eyelash. No one lied about anything, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt are next door neighbors. I guess you think anyone that kills themselves is a bad person? That’s not what I said I said that promoting her life as the epitome of happiness is stupid because she’s miserable and probably gets passed around the Hollywood execs getting raped and having horrible shit happen. Wouldn’t wish that existence on my worst enemy. All the money and fame in the world can’t buy her mental health and happiness."
rareinsults,fgi1bz0,t1_fgi0fmy,1580801085.0,"Um hate to break it to ya but I’ve heard all her songs unfortunately for my ears. I mean they aren’t terrible but they aren’t in any way shape or form positive, uplifting, or even very energetic. Give me songs you can dance to, songs that bring a bit of life, cuz that girl is half dead already. Her whole vibe is just depressed, greasy hair, and the way she talks is irritating. Music is something you can have your opinion on if you like that kinda mopey stuff have fun with it, but don’t pretend everyone has to love Billie just because you do."
aww,fghzrk6,t1_fghzp6f,1580799283.0,Gee I dunno maybe for clawing off idiots faces who try to kidnap them from nature where they’re happy and keep them in some losers dingy apartment.
aww,fghzkig,t1_fghz9a6,1580799071.0,That is horrible wtf is wrong with people.
rareinsults,fghyre3,t1_fghydso,1580798233.0,"Well I can’t say I do like her, she depresses me, her music depresses me and lowers my mood when I hear it on the radio. It’s all a matter of opinion and I just don’t like the green vomit colored energy she projects, it’s like this darkness all around her whenever I see her giving interviews all I see is someone who needs mental help and rest not to be the new obsession for children to try and mimic. She even admits she tried to kill herself, and almost glamourizes mental illness in a weird and twisted way. Idk how to explain it but I think she’s like being lifted up into popularity for all the wrong reasons."
rareinsults,fghx4nl,t1_fghwzqu,1580796618.0,"Glad I’m not the only one who noticed that, it’s not that I think depressed people are bad at all, it’s that I think making depression and Xanax and killing yourself seem cool is a really messed up way to think. Kids should be trying to be happier not embracing the depression of life."
news,fghwzze,t1_fghk9y9,1580796493.0,"Making little terrariums was my childhood past time me and my friend would catch ladybugs, fireflies at night and put them in our special netted bags for a few hours before releasing. I’d put grass and water and leaves and just watch them."
news,fghwra7,t3_eybv1k,1580796262.0,So sad I used to love playing in the fields behind my childhood home catching fireflies in my hands and letting them go. Such enchanted creatures the only insect I never feared.
rareinsults,fghwiyj,t3_eykbz4,1580796042.0,She’s just so low energy and negative her whole vibe is awful literally the worst possible role model for young girls she promotes Xanax and cutting yourself as fun and trendy.  I think it’s gross how the industry promotes a suicidally depressed and probably drug addicted girl as the high point of being young. Snooki from jersey shore is a better role model. Lol

AskReddit,fghrpys,t1_fgg8ub8,1580791987.0,Fun fact I nearly throw up just seeing the coricidan cough and cold medicine triple cs was a thing I used to do in high school. Me and my brother would buy bottles of dextromothorphan or the pills and take around 7 -9 and a few hours later the trippiest high comes. Did it everyday for 3 monthes and felt like I was walking on cotton candy.

witchcraft,fghhes7,t3_eyij6k,1580784876.0,Very true! Thanks for the story I have a similar one about plants but it’s more focused on myself being in a deeply depressed negative mindset and at that time all the houseplants would die it was like I had the opposite of a green thumb. Once I got happier now all my plants thrive!

funny,fggz1dn,t1_fggnkfo,1580772791.0,I also think he’s probably an average to short height that tends to help people be able to do way cooler backflips and stuff. I have this guy friend who’s around 5”3 and is awesome at backflips and can just do a bunch of cool stuff a taller person might hurt themselves doing.
Showerthoughts,fggnto7,t1_fggjz4g,1580765729.0,I mean it makes sense a muggle born is surprising everyone with having magical awesome abilities even though they weren’t expected to have any. A squib is expected to be magical and just got born with no magic how shitty.
antinatalism,fggf3e6,t3_eya4ti,1580760541.0,Ugh I took soccer as a kid and I sucked at it never liked getting kicked in the shins.
migraine,fggaqne,t1_fgg9t1v,1580757895.0,I agree I don’t like being grouped in with heroin addicts for taking pain medicine for my migraines. Sure it can be addictive but does that really count if the pain is never gonna go away or get better? I don’t think so. I take my meds as prescribed I don’t abuse them and I don’t enjoy the constant lecturing on opiate addiction. Yes I know bla bla bla people get addicted. But if I’m in chronic pain for life and will always need pain meds what’s the point in wringing our hands and acting like we deserve to be treated as addicts.
Health,fgeu4ek,t1_fgerx90,1580710077.0,"Oh trust me I know opiates can be addictive, I’ve suffered with trying to balance my chronic pain with not being addicted to opiates my whole life. I was prescribed them to treat my daily migraines and severe juvenile athritis and Lyme disease. While I do desperately wish there was a better solution to my pain management, when I’m off opiates my chronic pain is just unbearable. I know because I’ve detoxed off opiates myself many times, off every type from dilaudid to morphine, to methadone. Methadone is not the solution for me it caused the most severe side effects of any of the meds I’ve been on. It nearly ruined my stomach forever had to be hospitalized for the problems it caused. It was unfortunate that it had so many side effects because it did manage my pain and I loved not feeling dulled down, but weaning off methadone is way worse than morphine withdrawal the pain lasted for 6 monthes of hell. I wouldn’t wish any of it on my worst enemy. But considering the doctors have no better medicine, they have nothing to help my pain better I’m forced to need and use opiates for my migraines. I’ve tried every possible other option and only opiates work for severe pain that can’t be cured. I wish there was a better option and it sucks that random people steal pain patients meds and use them but that’s not my fault and I shouldn’t be denied treatment because some misuse their medicine. People need to stop demonizing the substance, the real demon is addiction and that can happen with meth, crack, or heroin."
TrueOffMyChest,fgem0ua,t1_fgekgbt,1580702885.0,Have you heard the audio it’s crazy. So awful poor Johnny was abused horribly. https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ
TrueOffMyChest,fgelwct,t1_fgegxja,1580702791.0,Here’s a link to the audio of Amber admitting she beats and abused Johnny. It’s crazy. https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ
TrueOffMyChest,fgelsga,t1_fgeeq5n,1580702706.0,Here’s a link to the audio of her admitting that she’s the one who beat Johnny with metal pans and with vases. https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ
TrueOffMyChest,fgelnac,t3_exy22c,1580702596.0,"I am so sorry for the abuse and lies you suffered. All I can say is I believe you. And everyone can maybe now begin to understand how evil and violent a woman can get when abusive like Amber Heard. She hit Johnny with pots, pans, vases, and the audio is just horrible to hear her defending her hitting him in the face. She’s a monster and truly evil manipulative person and I’m so glad now everyone can see Johnny is innocent."
Health,fgef82u,t3_exv5iq,1580698183.0,There is no opiate epidemic. Chronic pain patients and cancer patients are being punished and forced into doing heroin to find pain relief by these idiotic laws. The real problem is meth. That’s a real drug that ruins lives. Opiates are necessary life saving medicine.
Health,fgebn9q,t3_exuybp,1580695876.0,"They created the Coronavirus and “predicted” it in 2019 before it ever happened. Look up Event 201 they literally preprogrammed you to fear the coronavirus coming from a Chinese food market was predicted too before it ever happened. Sheep will trust the CDC and wonder why it was allowed to spread, they wanted it to be pandemic."
cursedcomments,fgeb0dh,t3_exsfs4,1580695453.0,Lol exactly even if fetuses did look like this why would that mean they deserve to live? That’s disgusting fetuses are all miniature lord Voldemort’s and should be destroyed like the nasty parasites they are. #abortallfetus
overpopulation,fgeahqx,t3_exlp8n,1580695104.0,I wish they would just enact forced sterilization for everyone all across the earth. In one generation we could reduce the population by several billion once the old folks die off. After that why bother creating more humans? The planet can’t sustain the current population theres no point in living if you have to stand shoulder to shoulder in pods eating rats to survive. I’d rather humans die out than see population increase.
self,fge9ge3,t1_fgbqfwj,1580694422.0,Not to sound dumb but I’m genuinely curious where you tend to meet new friends? I’m just past high school age and I’ve lost all my old friends who either moved away or just grew apart and I find myself lost for ways to meet new people. Sometimes I feel like I’ll go through life all alone never having those fun friendships anymore from middle and high school. People seem so busy all the time and most everyone seems to have their friends already it’s like really hard to find anyone who has time to give a new friend a chance.
NarcissisticAbuse,fge8u94,t3_exmy04,1580693994.0,"I used to be vibrant happy and extroverted with lots of friends, life of the party. He stole all of that and I’m now all alone. I have no friends anymore he turned all my old friends against me with vicious lies and once I was completely isolated there’s no way out. Can’t meet new people without friends to introduce you to their friends. I cry everyday from loneliness but at the same time am scared to socialize. Some days I just wanna kill myself to get away from the loneliness. I want new friends more than anything. :("
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fge7ffq,t3_exr7u7,1580693078.0,Take me away to Fairyland anytime I’m ok with leaving this sorrow filled land of pollution and going to a sunlit forest
SASSWitches,fg8d2gf,t1_fg8cx3v,1580615961.0,"Anytime honestly there’s too many aspects to my own beliefs to explain in one comment but I do recommend The children of Odin if you want a storytelling book of Nordic myths and gods like Thor, Odin and Freya. I don’t work with those deities yet but I know many people do. I’m constantly studying new philosophies and a true seeker of knowledge should never give up on finding new areas to learn about. Good luck on your search!!!!"
SASSWitches,fg8cue4,t1_fg5quce,1580615779.0,"Honestly there’s so many different ways to learn about magic, witchcraft, and other topics like Greek goddesses or gods. Personally I’d go to your local library and ask to see the section on mythology, then pick up some books on Ancient Greek, or Egyptian, or Celtic mythology. I personally believe that all ancient cultures held pieces of the greater truth. There are many different gods and goddesses and pantheons. I also like books on buddhism, reincarnation, and many many more topics. Become a scholar and read everything you can in books and online about as many ancient cultures as you can. I also love the website Gaia.com it has all kinds of fascinating series about the esoteric."
