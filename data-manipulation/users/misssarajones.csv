nycmeetups,ffpmlsd,t3_escxca,1580098826.0,Hello ! I just saw this post but I would like to meet up next time !
nycmeetups,ffplyd2,t3_eud17o,1580098334.0,I would love to !!
Water_Fasting,ffevow3,t3_et89y9,1579867526.0,"I started out at 185 lbs and after fasting I got down to 130 lbs and maintained for about a year . Welp, my dumbass decided to go on a binge eating episode (thank you depression) and I gained 15 lbs back . Most of it is water weight and some fat. 

Anyways , like another user said just don’t go back to old eating habits and track your calories and you should be fine ."
bipolar2,ffdgzjm,t3_esx5mm,1579820663.0,It is very common to have vivid dreams and even hallucinations while on lamotrigine. I had it for about two months then it finally went away.
GetMotivated,feo1k1t,t1_fenwb98,1579293882.0,"I’m still kind and would have a conversation with you , but I don’t think it would move past being a basic friend / acquaintance. It’s just me personally - knowing how you treat people based off of lookism turns me off.  

I’ve actually had these conversations about how I was treated when I was fat (not about them treating me bad but just in general ) just to see what they would say and they would deny it. I don’t think they are that self aware in their behavior towards people they consider unattractive. But I don’t know...

As for dating someone who treated me better after losing weight then asking me out - absolutely not . I can imagine how they treat people based off of other factors too. Definitely that type of treatment is a red flag."
GetMotivated,fenipbu,t1_fenhw03,1579285541.0,"Fat people are mostly considered unattractive by most people. You just said it yourself, it's one of those traits. I only focused on that because we are literally talking about overweight/obese people here because of the post. Lookism is however, very real."
GetMotivated,fengdnt,t1_fenfqao,1579284109.0,"Yes, it's so hard to prove unless you are in that person's shoes. I'm glad I have still remained a kind and open minded person even after my experiences. All I know is I call people out whenever I see people making comments about people's bodies. You never know where someone is in their journey in life."
GetMotivated,fenf5wm,t1_fenem7p,1579283367.0,"It was actually senior year of college and the school is HUGE - lost all the weight during my 3-4 months of summer and came back skinny. None of those people even wanted to talk to me from Freshmen to Junior year. I really tried my best bahaha. When I look back, all I can do is laugh. But I completely understand what you're getting at.  Making friends was 10x easier when I lost the weight. 

Forgot to mention earlier, but people were randomly complimenting my body - which was insane! Never had that before. 

Thank you so much :)"
GetMotivated,fenemz2,t1_feneh0h,1579283044.0,Good :) glad you can acknowledge my statement and have nothing to argue with. Have a good day.
GetMotivated,feneabm,t1_fendvns,1579282833.0,"I would disagree. I am judging based off of my experience and I have every right too. I am reflecting on how people treated me because I had to navigate around people’s rudeness and rejected in spaces I was allowed to be in. I am a very kind person and people were judging me based off of looks , not character. 

I never said each and every person was 100% bad person , but you can’t ignore this. My feelings are completely valid and I am not going to censor myself. 

Explain how I am judging quite harshly when they were treating me rudely without getting to know me? I never once insulted these people - just pointing out my observations."
GetMotivated,fenc3k9,t1_fena214,1579281498.0,"I would have to agree. I literally have the same personality now just like when I was obese. I gained and lost all my weight during college. The amount of rude people in my classes and how annoyed they were when I was doing remotely anything while obese was insane. I lost 65 lbs , no longer obese and the SAME people were 10x nicer , inviting me out and even two guys who never remotely even talked to me asked me out on a date. One of them actually very rude and always annoyed with me ! I was shocked. All of the sudden he was calling me cute and quirky.

I can just recall people rolling their eyes everytime I spoke up in class. After I lost the weight , people were more warm towards me and interested in what I had to say. I know this is anecdotal because it’s just my personal experience - but you can look up studies of the biases people have against fat people. 

I literally was confident and outgoing as an obese person but people refused to accept that and gave me disgusted / annoyed looks. 

Now everyone is so kind to me , no matter what I do. I really dislike it when people just assume it’s because your more “confident” and “dress nicer” because you lost weight. I’m literally the same person , just skinner."
Trufemcels,fe8uda8,t3_eo4rf9,1578931032.0,"Hey, I have PCOS and I was diagnosed with it at 16. I am 22 now. If you do not have a beard now , you most likely (and I mean very most likely) WILL NOT get it in the future. Just avoid processed and refined carbs and you’ll be fine. 

I personally ate a shit ton of junk food and I don’t show any signs of excessive male pattern hair growth. I probably have like 5 extra chin hairs and a very oh so slight hairy stomach (easy to get rid of), but that’s about it.

Please don’t be too worried. Try to eat foods and drink liquids that are good for your ovarian health. 

Also,I used to be 200 lbs (overeating due to depression) - but I got down to 130 lbs (I am 5’2) in 4 months (keto and fasting). You can still lose weight with PCOS. Processed carbs are literally the enemy for me lol.

All birth control does is mask the problem. A good clean diet with healthy fruits and vegetables will keep you balanced.

Also , look into Maca or Folic Acid. I used to go months without my period but now I get it every month. Maca makes you super horny though and intense pms symptoms sometimes (acne lol). But Those helped me out the most. 

If you have any questions let me know."
bipolar2,fdgibvp,t1_fdg7cck,1578398010.0,"On top of that, I read that bp2 has higher suicide and successful suicide rates. Not to compare, but it definitely is not easier."
relationships,fax2vf4,t3_eat9bo,1576378159.0,"Please continuing seeking therapy. That was all a headache to read and I hope your boyfriend continues to help you. The relationship was manipulative and abusive. You seem like a generous and kind person, I am so sorry that happened to you."
