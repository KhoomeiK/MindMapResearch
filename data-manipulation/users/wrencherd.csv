osx,ff94tfa,t3_esaw7l,1579704855.0,"I've never heard of such a thing as ""auto force quit"", so I'd say the answer is no.

The fastest way to quit applications on the desktop is press and hold the cmd key and press tab to cycle through the open apps. When the one you want to quit is highlighted, press q (while still pressing cmd).

If these apps open by themselves on startup it could be they are set do so; check the settings for your account in System Preferences.

If they open when you plug in your iPhone or iPod that can be changed as well (but I can't remember how exactly just now, sorry).

Cheers and good luck"
