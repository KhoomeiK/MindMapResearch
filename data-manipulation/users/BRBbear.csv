awwnime,ff87gjb,t1_ff7ng9n,1579668173.0,I feel your concern and want to say that you are not alone. Sometimes I get a bit nervous if i realize that I left my phone on my desk at work. (It’s locked and all the pics are in a secured folder) the fear is irrational.

Gun lance if you don’t try out the weapon with out a bit of digging can feel a bit off putting and feels same as lance.  HH, weird people use it. You have to have a special mindset. That’s just my observation."
