And for the second part, libertarianism for the most part doesn't really talk that much about the practicality of this or that action, but more on why it's is wrong in the first place

Yes, sure, small producers and farmers in the interior might need said infrastructure to operate, but more often than not, the amount of burocracies and taxes for production often make the final product more expensive, and thus less competitive against big brands who can easily pay those and produce in larger quantity to counter that

Whilea simple 200 dollar permit to open and receive customers in a small emporium/warehouse of beers, cheeses and whines might be all the owner has to spend
The higher prices due to taxes and burocracies make his products less appealing and they eventually go bankrupt because they can't afford to sell and more home made product for cheap because it's so hard to even open a company to try to live and sustain themselves"

facepalm,felw8p8,t1_felv92j,1579232497.0,"Ppl often try to compare the state to condominiums and apartments, but that's the catch, to be living there, you must consent with the rules and depending on your case, pay the rents, you are not forced to be there or to agree with if, but if not, you won't be living there, I don't know how it is where you live, but here in southern Brazil, around most big cities, condos often take huge areas and might have up to thousands of similarly built houses, those who pay rent/fully bought their properties are the ones paying the janitors, security guards and other employees that work there, and as you might expect, also have their own roads inside, maintained with that same money, nobody is forced to live there, and if one doesn't provide as good of a housing, doesn't pay their employees, does something shady, ppl won't move into that condo and it ends up being a competition to see which mini city can better off provide their inquilines with the best cost benefit

In sum, even tho it would depend on ppl to actively support their locality according to their ability to do so, I believe this is way better than letting an institution I didn't agree to take my money and spend it

Won't even get into the economic point of this, how economic planning has shown us countless times how it is inefficient and how some governmental action such as printing money and raising minimum wage always ends up in inflation and higher unemployment rates"

facepalm,feloytz,t1_feldcdl,1579227410.0,"Government by definition can't spend ""it's"" money efficiently

A government spends are simply reallocation of resources acquired forcefully and coercively with the use of force from one place to the other, the most efficient way to spend YOUR money is for you to spend it, and the most ""efficient"" way is also completely subjective in this case, if for example, you like to donate to charities because that gives you Joy, go on, but don't force others to do so as well

And I'm fully against taxes, not because I hate poor ppl, it's because it isn't fair to take, not only mine's, but everyone's money without their/each one's consent.

For a government to ""thrive"" it needs the production and the profits of the private sector to maintain it's spendings and whatnot, if the private sector has regulations, taxations and tarrifs over it, it gets to a point where's almost useless to try to produce over your subsistence.
