You are not alone. There are nearing eight billion people in this world. Can you even comprehend that? I know I can't.

Eight billion. That is... a seemingly infinite number of people you haven't yet met, seen, or interacted with.

You've been dealt an unfair deck of cards, and for that I am deeply sorry. Your friends and family sound like they have let you down time and time again.

Please know, though, that they represent such a tiny, insignificant subset of the world. Even if you include your dates, they still do.

You are not alone. Do not give up hope. The only thing you can do is keep trying, and I beg you to do so. I'm a random reddit stranger who is feeling super alone on this Thursday night, and I care about you. Please keep trying. Please keep fighting.

You do not have no-one left. You have a whole world left. Don't forget that. Please hold on. You matter. You matter so much."

Anxiety,ff3m0yy,t3_erdbtw,1579543918.0,"Cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me. Social Anxiety is one of the hardest things I've dealt with. 
There are a lot of methods of problematic thinking, and one of them is thinking you are a mind reader: ""They think i'm boring/stupid, they don't actually want to be talking to me, they think i'm so weird"".
How often do you catch yourself thinking these things about other people? I bet you spend a lot more time thinking and worrying about how you are being perceived than you are thinking about the other person.
It may help to realize that. Some people find it helpful to have a mantra of sorts: when the negative self talk starts happening, have something you tell yourself and either literally say it out loud if you can or force yourself to think of it. ""I am smart, interesting, and people like me."" It feels so weird to do it, and if you're anything like me, it's hard to say or think anything positive about yourself, but practice practice practice! At the very least, it can't hurt, right? 
Push your boundaries. It's hard, I know. You may fail. Everyone does. But as long as you keep putting yourself out there, you're doing better than the people who have given up. 
Remember that the way people think about themselves has a tendency to make us actually seem that way. If we panic over being boring and uninteresting, we probably will spend so much energy and time thinking about how not to be and judging ourselves for being that way, and we lose opportunities to actually improve. 
If we think we're just way too shy and nobody likes us, we will not put ourselves out there. We will assume people automatically think less of us, and then it's a vicious circle because if we don't put ourselves out there and give up, we will rarely meet people. And we blame it on our shyness. And so on. 
Sorry for this epic wall of text, here. I hope some of it helped. 
Really it comes down to being kind to yourself and maybe get some therapy. It can be so helpful!"
college,ff3kzkm,t3_er72ir,1579543279.0,"My first 2 years of college were great, and then it's like everything just hit me all at once. I decided to finish up the semester I had started, and then I took a year off to seek therapy, a new place to live... basically everything. Those initial few months were some of the worst I faced. I look back on it and am both proud and shocked that I stayed alive.
After I stepped back and re-evaluated things and took time to care for myself, it's gotten better, or at least more manageable. I know things are hard, and they will probably never be perfect, but I hope everyone finds one reason, no matter how small, to push on for one more day. Whether that's pushing through school, a job, the Job hunt, or life itself, find something to hold onto. 
And take care of yourselves!!! Take 5 minutes a day to do something nice for yourself."
venting,ff2kba3,t3_er8ult,1579510063.0,"Hey, I'm really sorry this happened. 

Take all the time you need to be sad and work through your feelings. I'm not sure what kinds of things he's going through, but there are so many struggles we can have that blind us to the world. Sometimes it truly is easier to figure out how to do it alone than to have added fear and sadness about ""dragging another person down with you"". I'm not trying to say that's what happened here, but I just want you to know that there are a lot of reasons why this may not be your fault.

&#x200B;

Take care of yourself. Reach out to some friends or loved ones, and don't be afraid to feel what you need to feel. It's always a hard thing to go through, no matter the circumstances.

Try to not beat yourself up over admitting your feelings to him. You were probably taken off guard and were feeling a lot of things very strongly. You shouldn't fault yourself.  Take some time for yourself. Sending you lots of love from one stranger to another. :)"

I am so glad that your family is supportive of you. I'm so glad that you reached out to them and weren't let down. You have amazing people around you, and I hope that you come out of these struggles one day.

Again, thank you for sharing. I love seeing these positive stories. They help me remember that the world isn't such a cruel, unforgiving place after all."
CatAdvice,ff2jy17,t3_er9a7p,1579509552.0,"Definitely get her checked out, just to make absolute certain everything is okay!

My 4yo cat likes to do something similar. He will sit in the bathroom or a back room and meow. He doesn't need anything; he's totally fine. He just gets lonely? I don't have a clue.

I'm going to hope that your kitty is similar and that nothing is wrong! I would just get her checked out given her age and cats tendency to hide their pain."
UnsentLetters,ff2jk81,t3_er7s70,1579509034.0,"Please stay safe, and please, please, please do not think that your feelings about it don't matter.

Talk to someone. Whether that's a professional or a friend, don't stay quiet. This is a huge thing, and you shouldn't suffer it alone.

Your feelings are valid.

I'm sorry you observed all of this. I'm sorry you were involved at all, no matter how indirectly.

AskReddit,fevruzu,t3_eqies2,1579400782.0,"I went through cancer treatments from 2 months old to almost 3 years.

There was of course nobody actually there, but I would talk out loud to him and play games with him.

When my treatments ended, I never mentioned him again.

UnsentLetters,feihkuc,t3_ep3hd7,1579138702.0,"Mental illness is such a tricky thing. It's so easy, when in the depths of depression or something else, to see the world absolutely, completely differently than other people see it. It's scary, both as the person in that depth and as the person watching it happen. I've been both.

I am so sorry for your loss, love. Please make sure you're getting help, talking about this to someone you trust... something that helps you process it. And please, as much as you can, remember the questions you're asking here; why didn't he speak up? And if you are able, please speak up. Please find someone who cares. Because just like you care about your friend, someone cares about you. I'm not trying to suggest this is the way you're thinking, but just in case you ever do. Remember how you feel about your friend and know that you are loved just as much.

Nobody should have to lose someone they care for. I wish it didn't happen, especially as you are so young. I hope that your friend has found peace, and I hope that you do, too, someday."

From what I do know, you do not need to have been in war and seen death and destruction to qualify. Abuse victims very often end up with PTSD diagnoses, and it sounds like you at least should be pursuing the idea.

&#x200B;

My father, too, acted in ways when I was a child that have left me with a struggle to handle loud, abrupt sounds, any kind of potential for physical violence, and raised voices. If you can tie your reactions back to what happened to you, you should look into some therapy for it. Even if you can't, it's always worth looking into.

&#x200B;

We're expected to get regular physical health checkups; you should offer yourself the same room to get your mental health examined. Even if you are healthy and this is a phase, it can help. Even if this is a long-lasting traumatic reaction, it can help. 

&#x200B;

Please do not compare your trauma or struggles to anyone else's. We will always find someone who has it ""worse"" than us, and they will find someone who has it worse than them. It's a cycle that will never end, and it does you no good. Treat yourself with the same care and respect you'd offer to a friend in your shoes. Get some help. Speak to your boyfriend about it. Look into therapy. You can get through this, and you are no less, no weaker or a person for dealing with it.

&#x200B;

Your trauma, no matter what it ever is, is heavy enough to matter. It's heavy enough to warrant support and care for yourself."

If his behavior that night is so different from what it normally is, I'd probably be getting the same thoughts. It may be a good idea to verify with both of them and make sure your actions with him are 100% okay. I would be on the lookout for more signs that he has feelings for you, because if it's not polyamorous, you may want to start putting some distance between yourselves for the sake of their relationship."
