bjj,ffikhev,t1_ffh7ba9,1579976032.0,This is another method which could work ...provide subsidies to BJJ clubs for all public services personnel. Would be better than nothing.
bjj,ffikdko,t1_ffgwhru,1579975959.0,"I totally agree with the sentiment, I only posited it due to it being the only way I would have envisioned it to come to fruition (in such a manner). How about like, once per week at each precinct... does that sound more feasible? It can be also used as a tool to help maintain fitness levels and it would definitely be better for like, retention of techniques, if theyre actually serious about this bjj thing. Otherwise they can forget it."
bjj,ffgp8pr,t1_ffgkz14,1579911587.0,"I dont think it means fund them each for whichever gym memberships they want. Rather, in lieu of their ""police training"" or fitness, they have to take a gracie-combatives / law enforcement tailored one time only course (the duration of which IDK), Im sure Rener would be all over developing that. As far as Im aware hes already got something to that effect and already taught to a few departments of different cities. Then, the ones who get bitten by the bug can then find a gym to train at in their own time."
AskReddit,fferfk3,t1_ffdqj3w,1579861840.0,"Your personal experience reminds me of a video I was watching last night. It was of khabib nurmagamedov (current UFC world lightweight champion) on a russian talkshow, and it kinda sounds like he has to justify his dagestani heritage. Its weird for someone who doesnt get it. I can kinda relate myself, being from a (breifly) ex soviet state, but I totally get you on the part about feeling like a foreigner in your own country.
