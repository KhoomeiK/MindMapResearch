CrestedGecko,feinojl,t3_ep5je5,1579142786.0,Hello Officer Geck I'd like to report a crime. There seems to be Pangea food footprints all over the feeding ledge I just cleaned but the criminal is nowhere to be seen.

offmychest,fe6qc7c,t3_ensp21,1578900446.0,"Thank you OP, I really appreciated hearing this today."
ibs,fdtyz70,t3_en15sx,1578724562.0,It has helped me a lot in the past. When my symptoms were especially bad I used to use the capsules (both ways) and it really did help decrease swelling and pain tremendously. Sadly I don't have access to them right now but will be getting them again someday.
ptsd,fdsp9zn,t3_emw904,1578706185.0,"Yes, he helps a lot- but for the sake of others relating/being aware he didn't help at first how I planned.

I studied, learned how to teach SDiT tasks, and planned for a few years before getting my guy- very excitedly waiting and hoping until the right opportunity came along.

Then as soon as I got that puppy I was hit with a few weeks of almost postpartum blues. I was so confused what was happening to me- wasn't this everything I wanted? But for some reason I cried a lot and was depressed (don't worry, he was still cared for and my spouse helped me tremendously).

When I confided in my therapist she gently explained this happens sometimes to those with (C)PTSD, and advised me to reach out to others who've gone through it.  I never would've imagined something like that could've happened, but a lot of others go through it as well and I learned I wasn't alone.

Now three years later he helps me so much, and I'm endlessly grateful to have him. He alerts to me a lot, helps get me out of the house, and makes me laugh with his goofy personality. I'm lucky to have him. Still I wish to let others know that if you end up feeling a lot of mixed, confusing emotions after you get your pup that it's okay- you're not alone and you won't feel that way long!"

offmychest,fcmt4cr,t3_ehzzeg,1577790969.0,The above comments say it all. Take this as a sign that you need to work on yourself- try to commit to it and don't make excuses for yourself. If you truly want to be happy in life it will take hard work inwardly.
offmychest,fcmsznp,t3_ehxzht,1577790787.0,"I'm so sorry you went through that. It isn't your fault in any way, but it's okay to have negative feelings over going through such a stressful situation. Consider talking to a therapist you feel comfortable with so they can help you heal."
offmychest,fcmsuio,t3_ehzrf6,1577790585.0,"I mean this with respect: are you sure it's love? It's okay to have strong feelings between two guys who are friends, and can be misunderstood sometimes due to society's influence.

Also maybe ask yourself why you're feeling this way. Are you unhappy with your life and looking for a distraction/fantasy? Focusing on improving your daily life might help you clear your head a bit."
offmychest,fcmpjrr,t3_ehzw9p,1577785856.0,"It's okay to grieve, and it's okay to have these feelings. Try to validate what you're going through, and it might help you heal."
ptsd,fcjpwwv,t3_ehfu3o,1577698681.0,"It's okay to be struggling, it doesn't make you any less important as a person. It might seem very hard now, but I promise with time you can look back on the present differently- and be proud of the immeasurable strength you've got to get through this. I believe in you!"
