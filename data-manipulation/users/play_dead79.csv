Just remember OP, for future reference, once he or any guy, gets past that first slap/kick/punch, then the subsequent ones come easier and easier for him. I am so happy u have a fantastic support system."

insaneparents,ffav4rc,t3_eshql0,1579745208.0,"It is this exact reason why I don't care what anyone thinks. No matter what we say or do to try and change the way people see us, those same people r going to say and think whatever they want to about us, so fuck em. We should only worry about how we feel about ourselves"
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffag4br,t1_ff9fl82,1579734950.0,"I have done so in the past but I am met with such disdain, as if me basically telling her to back off in so many words r less is completely disrespectful to her. I get so tired of being told I don't appreciate what she does for us, that we just use her for what she can give us."
abusiverelationships,ff98l6l,t3_esaz4y,1579707348.0,"I hate to tell u this, but there is nothing u can do to help her leave. Ultimately it is her choice, and she won't leave until she is ready to. For most women who are/were abused, myself included, it often takes a moment of hitting bottom, that makes us re-evaluate our whole relationship. It took my daughter calling my aunt for help after witnessing her father attack me right after I had been to urgent care for chest pains, all because of who had gone with me. I spent 14yrs with him, and even though I knew I needed to get out, I couldn't. We often fear what will happen to us when our sole source for financial support is/was our abuser. There are a slew of other reasons why.

What I can tell u is, be there for her. If she needs an ear to listen, be it. A shoulder to cry on, be it. Be the friend she'll need when times get tough, cause he is gonna do all he can to push her friends and family away, don't give up on her because she will need someone in her corner.

I wish u both peace"
AmItheAsshole,ff8yfnr,t1_ff8ucvg,1579700074.0,I completely agree with this experiment. And OP needs to post an update of how it went.
JUSTNOFAMILY,ff8wpyk,t1_ff8wb8g,1579698593.0,"U know that and I know that, but getting Auntie Phlem to understand that is something totally different.

As for a care facility, unless she is not in the right mind (IMO she never was, but I digress) they won't do anything but release her to go home. She acts helpless most of the time, like she can't do basic tasks but it's just a ploy to get attention, make someone feel sorry for her. Hell she has been spreading lies about me since I left high school.

Edit: I left out a word"

Please tell me he hasn't hit u yet, I pray he hasn't. I hope u find the courage to u and ur daughter out before it gets any worse."
AmItheAsshole,ff3yq7v,t3_erbpag,1579551770.0,"so totally NTA in this one, but I do have a question here. Did he offer a discounted price on the full set u received or was he expecting u to pay for them at full price? He said have taken some responsibility for a kid running around a place of business where she could get hurt or cause someone else to get hurt by a distracted tech."

Mild and docile my ass. U obviously have never visited a nursing care facility. The elderly have a tendency to not give a damn and say what is on their mind. I've seen an old women bite and kick a CNA when all she was trying to do was help her get into bed. I've seen remotes chucked across a room, arguments over seats in the lunchroom, tantrums over having their hair combed the wrong way."

abusiverelationships,fdux383,t3_emzrdb,1578740331.0,"U're not alone. I too have issues with being preprogrammed to expect certain reactions to certain situations. I'm not as bad as I used to be, but even after being free for 2 yrs, I still have them. I also still apologize constantly, some days r worse than others, like 3 days ago, I was saying I'm sorry for everything from it being cloudy out to her spilling her own pop. I notice I have a more difficult day when my anxiety is higher than on days when I'm more relaxed. All I can say is it does get easier, but it takes time. I am thankfully u have such an understanding of partner, I would have to say mine makes a world of difference in my progress also."
AmItheAsshole,fduvqgu,t3_emwxhd,1578739617.0,"NTA.  I actually don't think u over reacted. From what I gather, u actually seemed to be pretty stoked or him to make ur dinner to celebrate the day of ur birth. He knew before hand that u're a vegetarian, I mean it's not like u we're just dropping this new fad on him last minute and he has got rethink his meal plan for the night. He was planning on making a vegetarian a meat sauce lasagna for their birthday dinner, that they can't eat. I'd say u had every right to feel insulted and handled it accordingly. Now if he was gonna make u a nice eggplant lasagna, and the meat sauce one for everyone else, so that way u would be still be eating the same meal instead two different dishes, would have been better received than making everyone the fancy lasagna and u the boring marinara. He's a chef, u can't tell me he doesn't know how to make any exciting vegetarian dishes everybody would love to eat. He was just looking to make his fancy smancy lasagna and was using ur birthday as an excuse to do it. I read where ur mom said u should have turned him down nicer, really. U even gave him an opportunity to fix his ""mistake"" but he just flatly refused to even vegetarianize it for u. I don't even blame u for being offended at it. Please say u didn't apologize for being upset, and better yet, did she explain to him that the meal he was planning on making was just plain wrong. What would have happened if he had just made it and surprised u with it, then what? Sometimes us moms wanna keep the peace but I even I gotta say, ur reaction was just."
Assistance,fduj0ar,t3_en0b52,1578733801.0,"I have read the rules about requesting assistance and I am fully aware that I would have to have 300 karma to ask for any help. But I wasn't sure what the rule was if someone was actually offering assistance unsolicited. I did refer to rules and did not see anything for this instance, so I thought I would comment my issue just incase it was allowed. If not, I can atleast say I tried.

My family and I r actually in jeopardy of having our electricity getting shut off this coming Monday. We moved into our current home, a 3 bedroom trailer @$400 month from a 5 bedroom house @750 month. The bills in that place was ridiculously high with the electric bill being $200-400, and being water $34-200. My son would often give money to help with rent and bills due to me only drawing SSI. I also have 2 daughters, 15 & 11, but their father has nothing to do with us, so I don't receive child support. It took us over a year to finally find a place to go that was more affordable to live in. We moved on 12-15-19 but our final bill for our electricity at the old house is over $300, that is also counting the current bill of $60 for our new home. I was told 3 days ago that I had until the 13th to pay it or our electric is getting shut off. I have tried all the resources my town has available with no help since the bill is being carried over from the old house. It's like that house has to stick it to us one last time. If the electric wasn't bad enough, the water company is saying we used 132,300 gallons in 15days and they r saying we owe $2200. But I I'm wondering if there wasn't a leak that we were unaware of. I'm currently fighting with them over this. My main concern is the electric bill. Once we get these final bills from the old house taken care of, we should be in a much better position to live instead of just barely surviving."
AmItheAsshole,fdqo3tx,t3_empvgk,1578671206.0,"NTA....I never understood why people would go to the absolutely insane lengths to have the perfect wedding. Why do they even feel they have a right to make these crazy ass demands. I've seen them range from demanding people only have certain color clothes and specific shoes to demanding people cut their hair if it's too long, changing the color, or demanding they loose or gain weight because they weight too much or too little (which is the worst). Next they will be demanding someone get plastic surgery to change the shape of their nose or get lip, breast, butt, etc. implants.

What is even more insane is the people who totally agree with the couple's demands. These people try to guilt those who refuse to go along and say they will not go, making them feel like they r horrible people because they won't. So u have the couple who get angry because u refuse to completely change ur appearance for one day, and then their flying monkeys who basically say "" it's not fair for u to refuse this unreasonable demand and not go and ruin their wedding day because u won't be there! How dare u!""
