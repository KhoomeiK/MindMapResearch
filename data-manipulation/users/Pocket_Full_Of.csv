    I can see how its confusing. When I went to post this originally the system flagged it because I had the word bitch in my post saying that it was offensive. I didn't use it in that way, like towards any one person but I had to censor the word to get it to post. Apparently you can write it all you want in the comments though."

As a parent now I am trying so hard to get to know my kids as they are not as I want them to be. I want them to be comfortable and authentic and I dont want to fit them into a neat little box that I've desinged. I feel thats how I need to be with my parents and I hate that and the connection doesnt feel as meaningful as it does with those who I can be real with. It is what it is."

AmItheAsshole,fcrfvnf,t3_eiiohz,1577901284.0,"ESH If the both of you truly wanted to be honest with yourselves, I guarantee that neither of your individual needs are being met on some kind of level and that is what is leading to your problem. Her needs that aren't being met more than likely aren't even sexual while yours are. This turns into bottled up resentment on both sides which can greatly effect your sex life. For her it can be- not enough help around the house, or with the kids (if you have them) an imbalance in duties, a lack of communication. Do you laugh together, do you genuinely care when you ask each other how your day was? Is whats important to her important to you? Do you enjoy each others company and who you both are as individuals? All of this can be seen, heard or felt. It is SO IMPORTANT, the little things. Can your wife authentically express herself with you without judgement? Even, if its a snarky ugly comment that she makes about someone, maybe it made her seem petty to you but, you are her husband and you are her safe zone, and she is yours-no judgement. When you truly respect, empower and share responsibilities together and give each other room and acceptance then your sex life will come through. She has needs that either she's failing to communicate or your failing to listen to and its messing up your sexy time. You're both disappointing each other. Handle it, do the work, get the pay off."

Maybe even a few shitty months, okay I get that. Its tough to see passed the dark clouds but I am a FIRM believer in giving yourself time and paying attention on a larger scale. Especially, in the Winter months. I swear as Ive gotten older I can now see a pattern to where I feel the same way you are describing every Winter, my mood will up tick when its nice outside, may not be perfect feeling but I'm better than how I feel when its nasty and cold outside. There is a name for it, Seasonal Effective [Disorder.](https://Disorder.Pay) Pay close attention to yourself on a larger time frame. Do the work to find out if you are CLINICALLY depressed or if you're just feeling down for a bit of time. If you feel that you are at a point where you are CLINICALLY depressed then do yourself the favor of talking to a medical professional about it, know your options. If you were to go on something it doesn't have to be forever, everyone thinks that but its not true. I'm just telling you taking your own life is not an option it is not! Especially if you haven't even exhausted all other avenues to help yourself. It is unimaginable what taking your own life leaves behind. You cant say that no one would care, you wouldn't be here to know it would be too late and the damage, omg the damage its just not fair. I say this out of love and experience."
offmychest,fcr9su1,t1_fcr7p4c,1577898852.0,"I promise you there are people who would care. It is hard to feel like you can only rely on yourself but yourself can sometimes be the best person. Learn to love yourself and you dont need anyone else's love. We rely too much on other people. I used to be the same way but people disappoint every time. I honeslty think that I am pretty funny, I know that when someone else is hurting I genuinely care and it may not be recirpicated for me when I am hurting but I try to focus on what I put out and what I can give not what I can get. People are disappointing I try not to be and I've had to work hard to really get to know myself and learn that. I like stupid shit, I like videos of skinny malnourished dogs being rescued, I like to see the before and after. I like to drive and listen to music, Post Malone can be therapeutic, I really take the time to enjoy and appreciate my morning cup of coffee I can rely on that. I can rely on appreciating a stupid joke or even a small interaction with a stranger who was nice and actually said something in passing even if it was one of those dumb things like ""crazy weather today huh?"" its a moment that someone went outside of themselves to interact and they dont even know you. I used to get irritated with those people I'd be thinking ""STFU"" but not its funny. Its strange, its life. That person is probably going through shit too. Life can be ordinary and basic. Get to know yourself and dont feel so negatively about relying on yourself vs others. Its okay to have your own back, to make your own way, to pick a small goal and reach it on your own. Bad days come and go and so do good."

Its unimaginable the pain this causes the people who are left behind. Unimaginable. Seek help for the eating disorder and for the thoughts you're having. Try
offmychest,fcr5mff,t3_eik0zh,1577897125.0,"Get your hormones and your vitamin d checked. Also you're probably not living your most authentic life. Be you, be unapologetic, don't be afraid to be judged or disappoint. If you want to lay in bed on reddit all day do that, if you want to get out and go for a walk do that. Your family loves you no matter what and you are putting too much pressure on yourself. As a loving family member to someone who took their own life... I can honestly tell you that you have no idea what that does to the people who are left behind. Its not just that they will be sad and they will miss you. It is so so much more. They will fight to remember the last thing they said to you, fight to understand if they missed something, should have seen the signs, they'll want to know how long you had been thinking this? Was it just a split second decision? The small moments you've shared, the funny inside joke or the look you give each other that says exactly what your thinking- all of that will be missed. All of those moments that you thought you'd have more of they will torment themselves trying to remember and hold on to those- they didn't know they would be the last. Its not fair and it is not an option. You are loved allow yourself to be loved nobody is perfect and we love them anyway. My brother is a selfish person he disappoints me regularly but we have good times too he is an asshole and he means so much to me always no matter what. I'm a little needy and not needy enough, I worry about every little thing to where people feel like they probably have to force me out of my shell to enjoy things but they still love me. This is life its pretty average and ordinary but there are memories that will stand out on our natural last day big, small and in between. Manage your expectations and enjoy. Only you can change you."
