BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff2pt39,t1_fezavhh,1579518393.0,Agreed. I think of OfA as changing vessels. It can't be in two places at once.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff2pq1c,t1_fex7n4h,1579518269.0,"... I don't think that's how Eri's quirk is going to turn out. But hear me out as to why.

It took a *lot* of refinement to churn out these quirk erasing bullets, right? Like, serious R&D. Now, Overhaul mentioned developing bullets that would counter the red ones, but they obviously never got that far. So what that tells us is that Overhaul knew the effects of Eri's quirk are reversible. So there is likely some credence in predicting Mirio's rejuvenation. In fact, based on Nighteye's future sight prediction I'd say it's likely. 

Keep in mind though that this is a highly specific application of Eri's quirk. I'd say Eraserhead was more on the money in saying that Eri's quirk cannot be counted on. It will likely take too long to teach her control and it may very well be that she won't be able to manifest this specific function even after years of training. 

All Might getting OfA back though? I reject that notion completely. The only thing Eri could do is maybe heal his wound from AfO. He still has the ""buff dude"" quirk and that's something... I can't imagine Eri having the capability to manifest an incredibly powerful quirk into another person when it has been passed on to another person. That is, I believe OfA may only exist in a single person at a given time. 

Thus, in my opinion, the limit of Eri's capability lies in manifesting changes to the body alone. Including such attributes as gene expression (hence the ability to turn on or off quirks). She can rewind the fibers and the sinews but can't give any extra power."
