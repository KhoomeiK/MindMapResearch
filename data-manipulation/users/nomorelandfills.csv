dogs,ff7yfpt,t3_es10m5,1579661342.0,"I have been looking for a sane, healthy, young female medium-sized collie/mix/type for 3 years.  I'll tell you the secrets so you can quit wasting your time and go buy a dog:

1. **There is no canine overpopulation for dogs other than pit bulls.**  Do non-pit bull dogs still come into shelters?  Rarely.  This is a goodish thing, I think.  There aren't thousands of adoptable dogs dying of euthanasia anymore.  But the 'rescue' community is lying about the situation to milk money and guilt adoptions out of adopters.  Several people will react to this with shock and rage, and tell me I need to go south to find dogs galore dying daily in shelters.  They're incorrect.  There are a couple of large urban shelter systems - Texas and southern CA - which have mass canine overpopulation, and even those are still 60% or more pit bulls.  There may be a handful of rural shelters in the south with canine overpopulation - but I've seen those transport dogs coming north and like 95% of them are pit bulls.
2. **The rescues are going into shelters and scooping - oopsy, I meant 'pulling' - out the non-pit bulls that do come in, then reselling them to friends and fellow travellers.**  There aren't many non-pit bulls, but what there are, are 'saved' by a 'rescue' group which typically flips them within 1 month at a 500% markup.  Go to shelters long enough, and you see them - the rescuers, typically middle-aged women, standing in the parking lot or being escorted in the back door.  Their voices are always loud, to draw attention to their insider status and role as doggie savior, and their actions are always clear - they're removing the dogs any adopter would want.   Thanks, rescue!  Sure am glad you're saving dogs from adopters!   This way, a dog who was originally just ""#3432890, male, neutered, collie mix, seems friendly"" becomes ""Tango, neutered male who in order to overcome his traumatic upbringing needs secure mentor dog to show him the ropes and an owner willing to buy him a training facility in NJ to occupy his busy mind. No one with children under 30, a 9-5 job or other human attachments need apply.""  All shelters are being looted of any adoptable dogs by the rescue groups.  So you go to the rescues, right?  Good luck.  Check out the social media of any rescue group - and see how many 'foster fail!' announcements there are.  Any dog that strikes you as a likely pet is given to a 'friend of rescue' every time.  I had a friend who was told point-blank that she had to adopt a special needs dog in order to qualify for a healthy dog.  Take Ol' Gimp today, and we pinky-swear you'll get Sassy Puppy someday!  Unless our ol' pal Jen's sister's brother's cousin's BFF wants her...

3) **Shelters and rescues now refuse to euthanize dogs for any reason.**  I know, that's great, right?  No.  Do you really want to own a dog who chases people through the house to bite hard, fast and repeatedly?  Who trembles and shakes and plasters himself to the ground in terror at being asked to leave the house for a walk?  Who visibly wants to be friendly but is so clinically anxious that he essentially has a split personality, shrieking and snarling in terrorized anger when the potential friend stands up?  Shelters and rescues used to euthanize these dogs, crying in grief that they existed and suffered, but unwilling to pass the nightmare on to an innocent adopter.  Now they lie and say the dog's fine.

I have owned 3 shelter dogs and I'm not saying 'rescue dog' as if it should be synonymous with batshit.  I'm saying that's what it's come to.  There is a shortage of adoptable - ie, sane, healthy, normal - dogs in the US.  That makes it nearly impossible to adopt one unless you have lottery luck or an 'in' with a rescue group."
dogs,ff7v9jj,t1_fevyefp,1579659179.0,"Dogs are not medical equipment  and since I'm pretty sure you wouldn't advocate for 'retiring' an aged or sick (ie, broken) service dog to a landfill as one would a broken wheelchair, it's clear you're not even sincere about that description."
dogs,feva0ph,t3_eqoy0z,1579394946.0,"It's a great idea, and one the AKC breeders embraced for decades before the current vogue of excusing away bad behavior by claiming it's part of the breed's historical authenticity took hold.  Today it's called dumbing down, but it used to be quite acceptable to breed for pet temperaments.  

My proof it's a great idea?  Look who's having the most success in dog breeding today, and look who's having the worst failures.  The doodle breeders are creating tens of thousands of dogs every year, in a setting which most Americans are well aware is not 'reputable' and in many cases without any health testing that the 'reputable' breeders cry is the sole criterion for a good breeder - and those dogs stick those puppy homes for life.  Meanwhile, the pit bull breeders are creating tens of thousands of dogs every year in a similar BYB setting, but those animals are failing horribly out of home after home.  The average pit bull blows 3 homes within the first 2 years of its life and dies of euthanasia.  Every zip code has dozens of bully rescues, and zero doodle rescues.  

What's the big difference?  Are poodle crosses just magikal?  Are pit bulls just that hated?  No.  The doodles are bred to be pets, selected from breeds and individuals that are successful pets - conflict-avoidant, highly communicative, non-predatory, generally tolerant and resilient emotionally to stress.  The pit bulls are bred to be status symbols of machismo and brute power, selected from individuals that posses physical attributes that go along with successful dogfighting behaviors - conflict-seeking, low communication, predatory, intolerant of and highly sensitive to stress."
dogs,fev7wu8,t1_fet1n88,1579394255.0,"My ""um"" was more bafflement than sarcasm, but I get that tone can be difficult to translate.

You have accepted, apparently due to some unsavory past events, that Scout is aggressive.  Your description of Boo, however, is of a dog whose behaviors are not what dog parks were designed to handle - unpredictably 'skittish' and hyper are not synonyms for 'safe' and dogs who are released into a pen filled with other people's dogs and other people should be safe.

You have 2 dogs you fear will someday behave violently toward a stranger.  I'm not sure how to communicate this, but that is rare.  Very few dog owners seriously have concerns that their pet dogs will hurt someone.  If you live in a highly populated city, it's kind of important to not own dogs who you can't predict will remain safe around people in public.  People calling to your dog should provoke either a ""Huh?"" or complete disinterest from a dog.  If it provokes something worse, that's not because it's wrong to hail a dog, it's because there's a screw loose in the dog."
dogs,fev6lom,t3_eq28nv,1579393699.0,"The clue here is her offended self-righteousness about an airline employee attempting to pet the dog - oh, no, you're not allowed to pet service dogs!  People like this always willfully misunderstand that the issue here is that a service dog must be properly trained to ignore people, not that people must be properly trained to ignore service dogs.  The first is possible, but as its the handler's responsibility, people like this lady aren't interested.  The latter is impossible - you can't train the global population to obey your dog's needs - but since that's something you can whine ineffectually about while doing zip to train your dog, that's what she focuses on."

 *Boo basically has canine ADHD and can be very hyper and distracted when he meets a dog..  Boo is a big goofy sweetheart but can be quite jittery and excitable.  He's very playful and friendly and loves meeting new people/dogs, but  he's also a bit unpredictable when it comes to this sort of anxious and  skittish behavior.*  

*if you know your dog can be aggressive, do NOT bring it to a dog park. That is an unbelievable dick move.*  

Um.

*I'd also like to add a note to dogless pedestrians: do NOT try to get  the attention of a dog being walked. It's totally okay to smile, say hi,  or ask to pet them, but never call out to a dog that isn't yours. Not  only is it disruptive and annoying to the walker, but you also have no  idea how the dog could react. You could frighten them, provoke  aggression, or any number of things that could be avoided if you were  just polite.* 

Or, you know, if you owned dogs that weren't aggressive.  Or if you didn't insist on taking your aggressive dogs for walkies on public property along with the rest of the public, which seemingly hasn't received the How To Deal With Special Dogs handbook yet.  

Good news!  The collective rescue community is working on this very tome, which will become required reading for all schoolchildren by 2027.  The AHA and the AKC are teaming up on a special program entitled How To Approach A Dog (Trick Title - YOU NEVER APPROACH A DOG!) to educate children and their parents on the deadly nature of dogs."
dogs,fepmpfc,t3_eq1sp5,1579324604.0,"No.  FFS, people.  All the whining when rescue groups demand a fenced yard, and here we are doing the reverse.  Walking the dog is a big deal.  It's great for the dog.  But it's not bad if you don't do it.  I've had 3 dogs and all three exercised themselves just fine in my large yard.  One loved being outside alone, the other two had some FOMO issues but also enjoyed hanging outside alone."
dogs,fepmaz0,t3_eq7w4z,1579324270.0,"If he bruised her through several heavy layers of winter clothing, the dog is very seriously aggressive.  It doesn't matter why.  You got very lucky with this attack - because it was a real attack, not simply a bite - and because it was on a mailman, it's going to be an official bite.  If he attacks again, you will have a much larger legal problem.

Rabies is transmitted through saliva, so typically is only a concern if the dog's salivia was able to penetrate her skin.  If the bite failed to break skin, it would be unable to transmit rabies unless through some unlucky prior cut in her skin.  This is why most old dog bite laws carefully specific bites that break skin.

I would expect a citation for dog lacking rabies vaccination.  If you had 2 dogs get loose and one was properly vaccinated but killed a man and the other was overdue on its rabies vaccination but just knocked over a trashcan - you would get more citations for the second dog.  You'd get a loose dog on both, assuming you lived in an area with a leash law, and you'd get a rabies citation for the second dog.  The first, man-killing dog?  You'd get nothing.  Maybe some pressure to euthanize the dog, but a truly scary number of dogs who have maimed or killed humans have been returned to their owners by the authorities.

Your #1 problem is the dog.  No matter how much he loves you, and no matter how much he is trained or loved or cared for, a dog who attacks when upset, is a dog who poses an unacceptable risk of injury to everyone it encounters.  Life handling and containing such a dog is very difficult."
dogs,fepl9hz,t3_eq4qkk,1579323462.0,"Your dog, your decision, and she has some major health issues that make it very legit to decide to euthanize now.  Your dog's life from now on would be essentially hospice care, and that is a very demanding (although also rewarding) job. 

 *mostly seems to just want to lay and sleep.* 

That's pretty much a description of being very old.  I'm not criticizing you, please see above - but I also don't want to come down on the side of 'better a day too soon' because it's unrealistic.  Nobody lives at 100% for 100 years and die instantly of Too Oldness.  The second half of anyone's life, dog or human, is a decline.  Near the end of that decline is a very different life than the middle or start of the animal's life.  It doesn't mean the animal is suffering or ""should"" be euthanized.  Again, not criticizing your decision or overlooking the serious health issues of your dog, just saying that the general state of 'less' that bothers many people so much is not in itself a reason to euthanize."

dogs,fepk39i,t1_fekx2tz,1579322551.0,"Various thoughts: 

Nobody can control a 120lb dog under any conditions.  Anyone who believes they are in control of any dog of that size is deluding herself.  A 120lb dog on a leash is simply cooperating.  That's why large dogs who behave iffily - or whose owners appear fearful of the dog interacting with others - ring people's bells.  That's why this woman tagged your dog as a problem immediately.

You call your dog 'curious' and I wonder what that looks like.  I've seen 'curious' guard/fighting breeds and when you're the person on the receiving end of that aroused, focused stare, it reads more like predation than curiousity.  

The bit about her being 'welcome to have information on where I lived if she was just randomly concerned' is rich.  How was she supposed to approach your dogwalker, who was, by your account, running away with your agitated 120lb Rottweiler struggling to free itself of restraint.  That's not a situation that invites a great deal of ""Hey, listen, I want to be sure to avoid Cujo's home turf - where's he live? conversation."
dogs,feixmgy,t3_eolzu3,1579150041.0,"I find it interesting that there's a sense of 'well, if she's so upset by my giant, uncontrolled dog threatening her, why didn't she do the self-protective thing and avoid him?' here.  Yes, that does make immediate sense.  But it's morally vacant.  Why, really, should average people going about their day have to spend even a split second wondering if that nice dog walker is going to be able to stop that Rottie that's pulling her down the street, and if that Rottie is going to be curious or bitey when it gets up next to them?  The public sidewalks and roads aren't actually for people to train their aggressive (let's drop the reactive BS) 120lb Rottweilers.  They're not even for people to potty their giant Rottweilers while reverting to ""It's training! Because exposure!"" defenses when useful. 

If I saw a 120lb Rottweiler being walked in my neighborhood by someone who couldn't control it, I would be quite interested in know where it lived.  You call it stalking, I call it personal safety.  You're using a giant dog for personal safety, you can't squeak in protest when others want to use information about the home turf of the giant Rottweiler for their own personal safety."
dogs,feiwwqb,t3_ep3oas,1579149451.0,"Normal dogs have a long list of things they'll do before they want to physically interact.  They look, they bow, they bark, they sniff, they run, they snap, they look away, they pant, etc.  A lot of stuff goes on between any 2 dogs before they even think about physically interacting.  Sometimes we don't notice it, but it happens.  Aggressive dogs however, have a noticeable tendency to skip that communication and execute moves that to us may appear to simply be a semi-friendly if clumsy approach.  Thing is, it's not a friendly approach.  Would it be friendly if a strange man came racing across his front yard toward you as you walked?  He didn't make eye contact, didn't smile or wave or call out or say anything, he just stared and then charged.  When he gets close, he doesn't stop at the normal 'personal space' distance, but gets so close he's almost touching you.  He's tense, he's drawn up to his full height, and he's fully focused on you.  You smile nervously and move back slightly, trying to increase the distance, and he follows immediately.  You edge aside, and he blocks you.  He's looming, and now he's smiling.

It sounds like a horror movie, doesn't it?"
dogs,feivgf2,t3_ep6w7p,1579148300.0,"All owners do this.  Everyone has at least one moment that makes them cringe in retrospect where someone manhandled their beloved dog in front of them while they stood back uncertainly being 'nice'.   But there are two things to know: 

1) If your dog spends the rest of her life terrified of fireworks, it will not be as bad an outcome as having her owner stand by as she's frightened and abused.  I'm not a fragile flower who thinks dogs can never be yelled at, but dragging them is abusive *in this context*.  She was doing nothing wrong.  Her refusal to walk was fear, not disobedience.  Fear of fireworks can be worked around.  Lack or loss of trust in her owner can't be worked around.  

2) The only person who's going to seize your dog's leash and 'train' her without a request from you is a person who is UNQUALIFIED to do so.  There are many people out there who feel very strongly that they are wonderful, experienced dog trainers.  Many of them are very wrong.  I would be skeptical of your neighbor's advice.

Your dog is terrified of fireworks.  It's a very reasonable fear.  When's the last time something safe exploded?  When have you ever heard a sudden ""crack! boom!"" and seen pillows softly expanding in a sea of baby bunnies?  Sudden, loud percussive sounds always accompany dangerous things - guns, cannons, thunder, volcanoes."
dogs,feitjoi,t3_ep8o6x,1579146832.0,"The head is bull breed.  Boxer? Maybe.  More likely pit bull, given the sheer number of them running around with their moneymakers intact.  

The motion - that gangly, heavy puppy awkwardness - is more a heavy breed than a light one, ie, more pit bull than collie.  Feet and frame don't support a giant breed, or even a large, so another mark for pit bulls, the breed with more bulk than height.

The coat isn't flat, which means there's something coated in the background.  Which means outside the bulldogs, although not necessarily a shepherd.  

I'm guessing someone's bull mix got together with someone's shepherd mix.   A DNA test is going to come back pit bull 80% or higher."

Grieving is like recovering from physical damage - it even feels like physical pain a lot of the time.  The brain apparently processes emotional pain in the same way it processes physical pain.  So grief - great emotional pain - feels like a terrible injury or disease.  One that you'll survive, but only after a long, slow, hard recuperation. 

Some things end.  Some of them are so, so good and sweet and excruciating to lose.  Your dog dying means you'll lose her physical presence in your life.  Means she'll lose her physical presence in your life.  That's so painful and hard.  I'm so sorry you're going through this.  

But.  You don't lose her.  She doesn't lose you.  If you believe in no afterlife at all, you still have every memory and every way she made your life wonderful.  And you know she had all your life and company and was happy every day of her life.  If you do believe in an afterlife, or in something unknown and unknowable to us here - well, you may have more future plans for you and her.  I certainly do with my girls."

When the dog's personality is such that he becomes aggressive when anxious, it's much worse and a very dangerous situation.  In a giant breed, it's a potentially deadly problem - for the dog and for anyone in striking distance.

Crickets.

You can't.  Because every shelter and every rescue in the Northeast is running caravans down I95 *every single day* in hot pursuit of the elusive adoptable dogs - not pit bulls, not dying, not psychotic - to drag 5 hours north to sterilize and sell to the highest bidder - so they can fund Tank's 3rd TPO surgery and help sister shelter It's All Bout The Pitties' quest to get Sheba into that rehab trainer in Calgary for her little mauling habit.  
In 2020, adoptable dogs are like cash in the hand to the rescues, and they are competing hard for them.  I see the rescue groups come through my county shelter - they scope out everything that's not a pit bull, and not crazy, and ride out with any canine that's remotely adoptable.  From what I see online, this happens in every shelter everywhere in the US now – the rescue groups are scooping up whatever sells.  
Are there more unwanted dogs in Alabama than in NJ?  Sure.  Because there are some in Alabama and zero in NJ.  Does that mean that there are actually adoptable dogs that get overlooked in Alabama?  Maybe.  I can believe that when you have small rural shelters run by local police, you might easily end up without the sort of organized rescue efforts you see elsewhere.  But that’s a tiny subsection of shelters."
dogs,fe62zky,t3_engklo,1578880623.0,"This is how rescue operates:

Seeks out and acquires 2 dogs.

  
Dog A is relatively simple and re-sells quickly.  


Dog B also re-sells quickly, but boomerangs back to the rescue.  They scribble some notes on the dog's record: ""Tank is a sweetie who wuvvs people, and is fine with other pets."" becomes ""Tank is a super sweet angelbaby who gives you his heart within seconds but prefers to be your one and only!"" 

Dog B re-sells to a petless home and boomerangs back within 1 week.  Rinse and repeat the note scribbles: ""Tank is the sweetest dog we've EVER had, and farts gold farthings! His smile lights up a room, and his heart is officially TWO sizes too big LOL!  Tank says he loves people but likes to have a little personal space from dogs and LOL, kitties look like tasty treats to this big snacker!  Tank also needs a family without little ones; he is just too big and bouncy for children under 18.""

  
Dog B now sits in the kennel for 6 months before being rehomed yet again.  Rinse and repeat on the boomerang and scribbling.  As a general rule, the more bullshit, vague, histrionic burbling there is in a rescue dog's description, the worse the dog's behavior.

At this point, the dog really is stuck.  And so is the rescue.  They insanely don't want to 'give up' but they also realize the thing is coming back more crazy every time.  They blame the adopters, of course, but they realize endless adoption is not helping the dog.  So that's one possible reason for a weird, last-moment denial from a rescue group - you were going for a dog they know will not succeed in your home and not because of you."
dogs,fe61asz,t3_ens5dy,1578879559.0,"Dogs aren't usually visual creatures, so they don't tend to react to TV visuals.  They do respond to sound and motion.

dogs,fe60lr3,t3_enve1n,1578879114.0,"Two very different issues here.

1) I agree that ""adopt don't shop"" is pointless nonsense and insane.  There are bidding wars in US shelters today for adoptable dogs.  If you are seeking a normal family pet - young, healthy, sane, safe - then you are not ever 'saving' a shelter or rescue dog today.  There are far more people seeking those dogs - adoptable dogs - than there are dogs in need.  

2) I deeply disagree with your conceit that mixed breed dogs are undesirable because they are not the product of line breeding for consistent behaviors and appearance, and because their parents were not genetically tested to winkle out possible genetic health issues.  The obvious retort to this is that if line breeding produces consistent behaviors like the violent aggression of bulldogs and consistent appearances like the Xolo, we'll take inconsistency, thanks.  The other obvious response is that the purebred world needs to clean up their other consistent result of line breeding - genetic issues that they frequently do not steer away from and which even when steered away from become part of the problem because every time you remove a dog from the breeding population you're whittling away at the overall health of the breed.

However, the mixed breed dog question is potentially more complex because human BS has muddied the waters.  For 20 years, 2 groups of people have been very aggressively trying to redefine 'mutt' to mean 'unregistered by the AKC/UKC (and thus filth, wink).'  Pit bull breeders are extremely loud in claiming that 'only a registered AKC/UKC AmStaff or APBT is a pit bull and everything else is just a mutt."" And everyone in the fancy HATES the terrifying success of the doodles and has been screaming ""They're just expensive mutts!"" without visible sign of the general unwashed public taking a blind bit of notice. So the anti-mutt contingent has basically redefined 'mutt' as 'anything we didn't breed' and now is asserting that their products are the only ones that should be legal.  Interesting business model.

  *The bigger issue here to backyard breeders and puppy mills, especially  the ones acting like breeders. If a “breeder” pumps out a little of  goldendoodle puppies every month then that’s a puppy mill and that’s a  problem that should be stopped, not people going to reputable breeders.* 

Why?  People need dogs.  The reputable breeders are not keeping up with the demand for new dogs.  That's just the reality.  The AKC community, which has hated mixed breeds like poison as inferior, garbage dogs since its founding in eugenics-era America, has spent decades telling Americans to sterilize their pet dogs to reduce the surplus population.  We did.  And now there is no supply of available pet dogs in the shelters or rescue groups.  There are a billion pit bulls because the AKC likes the dogfighters' money and hurtled into bed with them with the same sort of sexy glee they showed when vaulting into bed with the mills.  But a billion hard-muscled, predatory, hyper-focused pit bulls are not quite what the average family is seeking in a household pet."
dogs,fdztzbs,t3_emngyx,1578795741.0,"The American Bully is a) a goldendoodle for men with small hands and b) a pit bull.  They used AmStaffs and APBTs as the founders, which is like me  saying I created a new breed called the American Shepherd by crossing Alsations with German Shepherd Dogs.  Newsflash - same breed.  Sure, they threw in some other pit doodles for funzies - the American Bulldog, the Olde English Bulldogg (gag at that deformation of a name).  It is, again, like saying you created a new breed when what you did was breed a lot of dogs of identical and near-identical breeds and doodles together and slapped a new brand on them.

Anywho.  The American Bully aka pit bull is a pit bull.  They kill about 30 people a year in the US.  Goldendoodles kill zero, Labs kill zero, etc.    The American Bully's fanciers try to market their version of pit bull as a safer breed.  I sometimes wonder how many bulldog shows end in angry slapfights over who screwed over who more recently in the media; the non-rescue variety of bulldog fancier seem to spend a lot of time pointing fingers at each other to weasel their way out of association with whatever bloodsoaked bully got perp-walked out to the animal control van. The American Bully is not safer overall, though the grotesque EB'ing going on with at least some of them can at least slow them down a bit.

You want a fun and affectionate dog?  You can pretty much be assured of it with a thoughtful purchase of any other type of dog, or you can get enter an interesting 10-year gamble that your bully will be one of those that never has a problem.  If you want to know how that works out, look at any shelter in the world.  There is not one shelter on the planet that is less than 50% pit bull.  In most areas, it's more like 80-90%.

She's going to get checked hard eventually.  If you're lucky, the dog who does it will be sane and just do a big threat display to say ""KNOCK IF OFF!"" and your dog will learn to be more polite.

dogs,fdzqybf,t3_en86tg,1578793770.0,"My neighbor's smallish dog had a 'game' where he lurked under a bush behind the owner's fence (the dog was dark, the fence was dark and lined heavily with thick, dark shrubs) until I was just past his hidey hole.  And then erupt barking in my ear.  Scared me badly every single time.  Dogs play all sorts of horrible games in their own yards, frustrated at seeing other dogs prance by on walks.  This stalk/glare/charge behavior is nasty, but if the dog's not trying to blow the fence to actually make contact, I think he's likely fully engaged mentally, not the sort of disengaged automaton implied by ""predatory drift"".

btw - ""Predatory drift"" is a bad way to understand dog behavior, for several reasons.  

1) It is not based on dog behavior.  It was originally 'instinctive drift' - a term coined by people who were not studying dogs.  In each case, they noted that trained animals sometimes would stop performing a learned behavior in favor of a more basic, instinctive behavior, usually a behavior related to feeding.  Dolphins would wander off to chase and consume prey, raccoons would start interrupting a trained sequence of depositing coins in a bank by 'washing' the coins as if they were food, and pigs also trained to deposit coins would start rooting them into the earth as if hunting for food.  

2) As mentioned above, this 'drift' always involved an animal leaving a learned behavior.  In virtually every case I've ever seen of people trying to explain/understand/justify a dog's predatory behavior toward another dog as 'drift', the predatory dog is not actually 'drifting' away from a trained/learned behavior.  They are not obedience dogs leaping out of a ring to maul a passing cat, or guide dogs who drag their blind handler up a tree after a squirrel - they're always dogs who are just running in a yard, in a dog park, walking on a leash, etc.  

3) As also mentioned above, this 'drift' always involved an animal who leaves the learned/trained behavior for a basic, natural behavior based on eating.  The dolphin didn't leave the trainer to attack another dolphin, the raccoon didn't start washing another raccoon and drown it, the pig didn't shove a piglet down and grind it to death against the ground.  Dogs don't eat other dogs.  

Veterinarian Ian Dunbar coined and dog trainer Jean Donaldson popularized the term 'predatory drift' in reference to dogs.  Both held degrees in psychology, but neither seems to have noticed that the interesting possible implications of having invented and promoted a term which helped them 'solve' their own professional problems - both of them focused much of their careers on aggressive dogs.  If you can tell an owner ""Well, Mopsy killed Flopsy because for an instant, she saw Flopsy as a moving hamburger"" that's a lot more appealing that admitting ""Mopsy's a shit dog that took out another dog without any reason.  Hope you don't have kids.""

dogs,fdtlfzh,t3_emnk00,1578718465.0,"Dogs who ""must play with"" other dogs are behaving aggressively.  Dogs have a very elaborate body language which allows them to co-exist peacefully.  A dog who glances at your dog and then looks away is saying to her ""I'm not interested.  I'm harmless to you, and I do not wish to engage with you.""  A dog who intensely focuses on other dogs, head and ears alert, body straight, and escalates into out-of-control behavior is saying something very, very different.  

I'm not saying your dog is bad.  A lot of dogs are either clueless or bossy, and will readily slip over the line between interest in another dog and insisting on a confrontation.  My dog was a bossy collie mix who in her youth could be obnoxious if allowed.  I had suffered enough of that sort of thing from other people's dogs to realize it wasn't a good idea, and I stopped her.  She didn't get off-leash privileges until she was old enough to behave herself.  I will tell you from experience both with the times she got away from me and from times loose dogs approached her - when a dog won't leave another dog alone, that's going to end in violence.  A dog who circles and sniffs and jumps back and then circles back in, over and over, is escalating into a fight situation.  It would be like having a guy approach you on a street, get within an inch of your face, ignore your tense body language, ignore your increased rate of speed, follow you into stores and down the street, ignore your request that he move back, keep sniffing your cheek and jumping away, then repeating over and over.

Something fresh and new and fun!  Oh, wait, I meant - um - sad and tragic and clickbait.  Because funding!  The only mileage they'll get out of your dog is a round of ""Sparky is soooooo sad!

 What you do now is choose what you want to do.  Personally, I'd pursue that rescue group like a Hellhound to get them to take the dog back.  More rescue groups need to be forced to deal with the fallout of their choices in what to rescue, what to rehome, and what lies they'll tell innocent adopters.  If they have social media sites, go there and tell your story and beg for help.  Before they take down your comments, check out who comes on to comment - and stalk those people back because at least one of them will be involved with the rescue group.  You can backtrack that way.  Also, if the group is registered as a nonprofit, you can search for their founder online.

If you just never want to deal with these people again, you can certainly go to another rescue group for help.  The original rescue isn't going to come after you for breach of contract.  #1 they already breached their own contract and #2, they absolutely 110% would rather spend their time and money on histrionic rehomings of this week's crop of Kentucky dogs than on a lawyer."

Well, that's terrifying. The bad news is, you own an anxious, aggressive pit bull.  The good news is, you've had it from a very young age and it hasn't managed to get in any real practice at attacking anyone.  Because charging is nasty, but most dogs have a learning period where they manage to get loose and charge and menace but work their way up to biting.  So you need to focus on keeping Luna contained.  Which you've been doing and which you obviously realize is a massive amount of work.

Also - STOP BLAMING YOURSELF.  The socialization period for dogs ends right around the point at which you acquired Luna.  That socialization window goes from 6-16 weeks, or 1.5-4 months.  Also, socialization is not everything.  You can socialize a puppy perfectly and still get an aggressive dog.  Genetics is half the dog.  You can push the genetics very hard and get something safer than nature intended, but you won't get a friendly, safe dog.   

She's not mean.  She's clinically anxious, and she responds to that anxiety by becoming violent.  Most aggressive dogs are motivated by anxiety - they're afraid of new people, they flip their lids when you knock over a trash can, etc.   You're already doing a good job building a relationship where she trusts that you can protect her, so that she feels able to take her attention - hyper-vigilant and aggression-prone though it is - off, for instance, the stranger you pass on a walk, because you say her name.

1) The descriptions of her actions toward the dog are *no*t saying that she actually hurts or neglects the dog - just that she threatens to do so.  

 *Her anger fumed and there was constant tension between me and her. She  will keep him locked up all day in a cage with a blanket over it for  hours* ***when I’m gone****, she wants to neglect him and hit him* ***when I’m not  home*** *and I can tell he is not having it because my dog is not himself  anymore.*

There are all sorts of gradations of bad behavior.  Some absolutely need to be outlawed and prosecuted because there's malice and intentional evil involved.  But once you start getting into actions which unintentionally produce bad outcomes, it gets much less clear.  And at the risk of defaulting to the slippery slope argument, it does start calling everything we do with animals into question once we begin calling convenience actions abuse.

There are at least 2 separate groups working on recreating the Scottish Collie in their own way - the Old Time Scotch Collie Association and another group which is more focused on a smaller, lighter RC (I can't recall their name right now, they're a less visible group).  The OTSC has a small number of dogs they feel are descendants of their breed, and are crossing in RCs and English Shepherds.  

The OTSC dogs are a landrace breed, which means there's no set standard.  They are designed to be what is needed for their work, and to be what appeals to their owners.  English Shepherds are also a landrace breed.  The basic work of the collie breeds overall has always been as family pet and useful all-around dog on a small rural property.  So non-violent, watchful, bossy, responsive, smart and nimble.   There is a tendency among some breeders to value a dog with predatory behaviors toward smaller animals - if you read 19th century descriptions of the original Scotch Collies, they were often hailed as excellent pest killers and, when crossed with hounds, excellent hunting dogs.

It happened because the Malamute is lethally aggressive over food.

You won't get up at 2am in January because the dog has diarrhea from stealing chicken breasts off the counter - and you won't be standing there patiently waiting for her to circle the yard for the 12th time and suddenly hear owls you never knew existed in your neighborhood.  The magic and joy and routine all blip out of existence.  It's excruciating.  

So I saw screw that new normal if you want.  You can't change the fact that your dog died.  But you can refuse to let go of some of what you shared.

dogs,fd6zoq3,t3_ek4ztv,1578197695.0,"There's a book from the early 2000s called ""Successful Dog Adoption"" which has, hands down, the best guide to what to look for in a shelter dog.  The author is Sue Sternberg, who ran her own shelter in NY state at the time and is a trainer for shelters now.  She also has DVDs and other materials for sale at Dogwise.  Basically, she thinks sociability is the key attribute to look for - a dog should be friendly, should seek petting and contact without overpowering (ie, leaning on you, not jumping on you), should visibly wish to establish an emotional connection with you.

The drawback here is that these dogs are few and far between in the current shelter system.  I have spent the past 3 years looking for a new dog in the shelter/rescue worlds, and I would estimate I've seen maybe 10 dogs who were sociable.  

It is a major victory that we now euthanize zero adoptable dogs in the US.   Instead, we prolong the lives of many unadoptable dogs, often while they suffer horrifically, in hopes of bullying/guilting some good person into taking them home for 10 years of hell.  Be very careful at the shelter.  The employees and the volunteers will lie to your face, will downplay bad behaviors, will rebrand troubling behaviors as funny or positive ones.  Their funding depends on never euthanizing an animal, and they will do anything to get you to take one of their difficult dogs.

Examples: 

Typical shelter dog ad: ""Tank loves his toys so much, he can't share! Wants to be your one and only! Best with kids over 15.""

Translation: Tank has growled, snapped and bitten people and other animals over food, toys and random objects on the ground.

Typical shelter dog ad: ""Princess SweetPea is a little love pupper wishing for a place to hang her hat! She was abandoned here by a family that cared more about moving into an apartment complex with breed bans than about their bootiful baby dog, and kennel life has been hard on her!  She's sooooo scared in the shelter, and people think she's mean just because she barks at them, so she's been with us way too long!  Sweetiepea loves treats and knows how to sit!""

Translation: PS is anxious, hard barks at every single person o the face of the earth out of a combo platter of terror, defensiveness and aggression, and is so difficult to handle that even the workers and volunteers can barely handle her and know virtually nothing about her except that she eats and sits.\*

Hints:   
Always look out for dog descriptions that underwhelm.   Eating, allowing people to touch them and knowing the command for 'sit' are actually not accomplishments.  EVERY DOG ON THE PLANET knows how to 'sit' - circus tigers know how to 'sit.'  

When a dog is a 'volunteer fave!' that's a huge red flag. A volunteer/shelter/worker 'fave' is a dog who's been there a while.  In 99% of the US, shelters flip dogs within 24-48 hours.  A dog who doesn't get snapped up quickly is a dog who is not sociable, who frightens people or seems 'off' to them.  

When a shelter ad/worker is pumped about a dog but everything they say about the dog is incredibly generic, there's an iceberg they're not mentioning.  They will not admit it until they absolutely have to - and that may be after you've been ushered into an unprotected meeting with the dog, after you've bought the dog, or after the dog's attacked or been revealed to be ill at your home.

 *Joining the Working group, the Dogo Argentino is a large hunting dog developed in Argentina. It was originally used to hunt big game, such as   boar and mountain lion. Dogos are confident, courageous, loyal and   affectionate with their family. They aren’t for the inexperienced dog   owner, however. They have strong guarding instincts and tend to be very   protective and territorial. The breed is a powerful, athletic working   dog that needs a great deal of daily exercise and frequent interaction   with people. Dogos have a short, smooth coat that needs weekly brushing.   Because of their white coat, they can get easily sunburned.* 

This glib admission that the Dogo is dangerous will morph, within 2 years, into ""Dogos need strong, consistent owners who can give them the guidance and love they need.  Despite uneducated bias against their strong bodies and blocky heads, Dogos are not aggressive unless raised to be aggressive.  Given the proper raising and good exercise, they are no more likely to be aggressive than a Beagle, and that whole unfortunate incident with the toddlers last week was something that could have occurred in any breed."""

The only people who claim breed bans are ineffective are the people who are making money off breeding and selling violent dog breeds.  And the AKC, which is an astonishingly accurate barometer of the rightness of any issue - whatever position they take is always the bad one.

*If  you want solutions from people who spend their lives around dogs and  understand behavior and ownership,* 

These people are called ""owners"" not ""trainers and veterinary behaviorists"" (and, presumably, vet techs, groomers, and PetSmart clerks).  Being someone whose paycheck comes from trimming nails, giving rabies shots or counseling stressed owners over why their rescue 'lab/pointer mix' eviscerated their cat does not equal someone who understands dogs, dog behavior or dog ownership.     

*we're all here, ready to help, most  of all trainers and veterinary behaviorists who could fix it if anyone  would listen and implement the appropriate steps.* 

This may come as a severe shock to anyone under 35, but dog people used to accept the idea of breed bans and breed controls as the obvious, commonsense way to limit the ownership of dangerous breeds to people who would not place them into situations they can't handle.  Today, those same dog pros will be silent as a client insists on taking their Cane Corso or Black Russian Terrier into a nursing home as a therapy dog.  

*Sadly, they have  learned humans are so stuck in their ways, any advice that doesn't blame  dogs, but rather call for humans to change, will fall on deaf ears.  More kids, elderly, and just great people will die.* 

This is a horrific statement.  The answer to 'how do we fix the problem of dangerous dogs' is not 'we tell people all dogs are dangerous, deadly and need to be treated like exotic pets.'  

The following is gibberish pasted for posterity.  Followed by a truly appalling, disgusting spewing of bullshit, in bold (my add).

*It sucks. Some  places will attempt breed bans, which will fail, like every other place,  so more people will die in the fruitless attempt. In the end, angry  people don't care about facts, they'll still kill all the Dobies,  Rottweilers, or Pits (depending on the era), despite the fact that that  has never helped. It's sad, but all anyone with college level stats and a   rudimentary level of dog behavior can do, is try to occasionally throw  truths out there so anyone smart enough can listen. Most don't.*

*I  have tried so hard, I have appealed to sense, to logic, to mathematics,  to canine behavior, NONE of it matters. All these people care about is  pit bulls kill more than other dogs. So do minorities in the US, but  that doesn't mean they are inherently more dangerous. Westerners want to  do anything but say society is even partially the culprit and could fix  things. Fine. Have fun with that, society. I'm sorry to people who die  because of that, to children, I tried to save you. I tried.*

*In  the meantime, you guys do what you want as you will anyway. We all try  to give you the answer, if you wanted to ignore it, well I did my part.  It's not my responsibility at this point. Would it have made more sense  to, idk require a super brief temperament test for all dogs or of even a  certain few breeds to allow them to remain unaltered barring medical  necessity? Sure. It wouldn't have stopped all attacking, but it may have  helped, especially if they did all breeds, and according to those that  think it's all DNA, it should have eliminated any dog attacks (not true,  but any breeding temperament test may have helped a bit.)*

 ***But everyone  wants to just kill a bunch of dogs*** *to make sure it doesn't even at all  seem like it's a problem people have. So go have fun, irresponsible  people, and know this is ALL your fault. ALL of the dog behaviorists,  CPDTS, vets, even the freaking CDC, ALL of the experts, they TRIED. They  tried to save the kids, save the elderly, save all the innocent  bystanders. Their opinion only matters as much as the ill informed want  to listen.*

The only people who want to kill dogs are those who a) choose breeds which are genetically prone to attacking and killing dogs and b) breed and sell so many of those breeds that there is a surplus of them which is then euthanized en masse.  This 'problem people have' didn't exist prior to the pit bull explosion.  Fatal dog attacks were linked to very specific ownership behaviors - a chained, male, intact adult dog of a guard breed that got access to a child.  That was the scenario of virtually all fatal dog attacks until the 1980s.  There were no fatal attacks in which the nuclear fam was snuggling on the couch when Snoopy the Beagle crushed the infant's skull.  No fatal attacks in which Grannie was hanging laundry when Fido the Lab began ripping at her legs, pulled her to the ground and then destroyed her arms.  The fatal dog attack scenarios of the modern era belong to breed-based behaviors, not human failings."
dogs,fccmz9e,t3_egtbh5,1577600277.0,"2 years is a perfect time to train.  He's an adult, and there are no growth-related limitations on what you can do with him (ie, you can't jump a developing adolescent, you can't expect a little puppy to do much).  My first dog pulled like a freight train, and was smaller than a Lab, so I feel your pain!  

Ideas: 

1) Dogs pull in part because the handler is resisting their choice of speed and direction.  In other words, if you were able to run as fast as him in the direction he wants to go, there wouldn't be any pulling happening.  Since you can't run as fast as him and you don't always want to go in his direction, you get pulling.  One way to reduce it is to give him an off-leash run prior to the walk, if you have access to a yard.  That way you're dealing with a slightly less speedy dog.  Another way to reduce the pulling is simpler, if you don't have a yard - try going the direction he wants.  Take a walk where he picks every direction (except, obviously, into traffic or into someone's house).  Dogs don't get to control much about their lives - we control their food, their interactions, their dens, everything.  I think letting them choose their walking route is a big deal to them.

2) Dogs also pull because the world is more interesting than the handler.  Try recapturing your dog's attention by being interesting.  Change directions unexpectedly, cross the street suddenly.  Start requiring your dog to pause and wait at corners (a nice safety idea as well, to put them in the habit of hesitating at corners).  Take your dog to interesting places - alleys, behind stores, up to trash cans, into empty lots, into parking lots.  A dog who's sniffing isn't pulling."

And I quote: 

 ***The most basic requirement buyers should have is for their  breeder to have completed all of the breed's health tests on each parent****.*  

That is clearly insane.  The most basic requirement is that the dogs be treated humanely.  Do you really think this goes without saying?  In a world where people are raising breeding puppies in hutches and warehousing dogs in cages, do you really think you need to skip the basic of the breeding dogs  must be treated decently?  And NO, health testing does not imply good treatment.  I've known AKC breeders whose health-tested stock lived 24/7 in xpens (small breeds) and health-tested herding dogs whose owners kept them kenneled most of the time.

 ***Responsible breeders take steps to provide evidence of their dog's temperament and abilities*** *and this proof is generally seen in two ways:* 

1. *Competing and titling their breeding stock in one or more dog sports.*
2. *Successfully working their breeding stock in one or more forms of breed-specific work.*

This is a metric designed by and for dog sport enthusiasts.  Most people are seeking pet dogs, and there is no competition for that.  Breeding for dog sports and breed-specific work produces shitty pets for normal pet owners.  If you find that an upsetting idea, try rephrasing it in the self-serving way common to dog sport hobbyists: most people can't handle my breed - my breed is so super special, normal humans who don't live and breathe flyball/schutzhund/field trials/etc are incapable of giving them the training/exercise/attention/handling/etc that they need to not fail horribly out of the home within 6 months. 

And those two guidelines are all that is provided.  There is zero mention made of the COI stats on the breeds, on the effect of high COI on longevity and disease and hardiness, on the high cost and scarcity of any given dog breed in any given place (aka, on top of the $1-4k puppy sticker price, there's a nice transportation cost involved), no mention of the sheer indifference of dog breeders in the 'reputable' community to newbies seeking a pet.  

In short - the guidelines here ignore the physical and emotional welfare of the breeder dogs (you know, the ones who are going to be passing on their genetics and epigentics to that $3k puppy you flew 4 hours to pick up), and ignore the realistic concerns and needs of the puppy buyer.

1) Your new pet is not distracted by other dogs,  he's behaving aggressively.

Dogs who stare at other dogs, even when they're not bouncing around barking, are behaving dangerously.  Normal dog behavior is to glance at another dog and keep on keeping on.

Sorry.  I just know from experience that when you have a dog like this, you can't depend on the dog making that normal association from friendly behavior in situation A to friendly behavior in situation B.

However, that does not lead to the conclusion that “this has happened to almost all breeds of dogs.”  For one thing, it doesn’t “happen” to a breed of dog, it is something a breed of dog does.  For another, almost no dog breeds have EVER been involved in killing a human.  The fatal attack of a dog on a human is a rare thing; when it does occur, the dog is virtually always one of a tiny number of breeds.  There are a handful of real outliers, like the Old English Sheepdog that killed someone in the 1980s, but most breeds have had ZERO fatal attacks.

Great Danes have indeed attacked and killed people before.  But they’re outliers.  The last time a Great Dane attacked and killed a human was over 10 years earlier, on May 11, 2009.  Since Mrs. Matthews' death, there have been no more Great Dane killings.

By contrast, pit bulls have killed at least 4 people in the US in just the past 30 days.  Melissa Astacio was attacked and killed by her pit bull on Friday, December 21, 2019.  The same day, 3 pit bulls attacked and killed a woman in Houston.

*One note:  Mary Matthews, 49, was found dead by her husband and his adult son from a previous marriage.  The victim was known to collect rescue dogs, mostly Great Danes; she also had a history of breeding pit bulls with husband Mark.  His behavior in the case was extremely suspicious - his son Luke called 911 and failed to mention the blood-soaked house and victim, instead asserting that she had a drug problem and calling it an overdose.  Mark very aggressively pursued media to present the Great Danes as aggressive, dangerous dogs prior to the attack - leading to suspicions among those who follow dog attacks that he was covering for a third dog, one he removed from the house before emergency responders arrived.  Perhaps not.  But the deceptive 911 call, and the sheer number of dogs circulating through the household (as well as Mark's criminal history) raise a question in this case.

This entire philosophy of dogs needing jobs and special breeds need special jobs began 30 years ago with the best intentions, but it's being blown all out of proportion by a generation hooked on absolutes.  Would a JRT like to live on a farm, killing rodents in the barn and running loose all day as the farm owner bustles about training horses or milking cows or whatever?  Sure.  And I'd like to spend my days gardening and reading.  And some JRTs have that life and some people have that life, but most of us get along with a less ideal life.  And those dogs and those humans help each other get through those lives.  My less-than-ideal life would have been immeasurably poorer without my BC mix, whose ideal life was supposedly to race around on a moor somewhere bossing sheep.  She got along by racing around in a NJ yard bossing me and my family.

Take her to the vet to investigate the weight gain as a medical issue.  Diabetes, for one, can present as ravenous eating and weight fluctuations."
dogs,fc46jw6,t3_eg1k9l,1577407972.0,"If they think of themselves as saints for adopting a fighting pit bull with zero manners and lots of aggression, you're screwed.  They are emotionally involved with both the animal and with their own rewarding identity as a saint, and they will never be able to see this situation clearly.   You are completely right to protect your pet from theirs.  There is no explanation needed.  You can simply say ""No.""  If pressed, you can say ""Mom, you adopted an aggressive pit bull from a fighting background that behaves abnormally and dangerously around dogs.  That was your choice.  This is the pet you chose.  You have to deal with that, including the fact that nobody is going to want their dog to get in striking distance."" 

It's a safety issue for the humans too.  People have been killed trying to convince pit bulls to quit killing each other and other animals."
dogs,fc46156,t3_efx1al,1577407567.0,"Dog or infant?  Infant wins.  Anxious dog living in hell unless owner is beside them?  Very, very borderline quality of life.  Dog in pain most of the time?  Ditto.

However, you don't mention vet care.  Has his pain been worked on?  I know it may not be fixable, just wanted to clarify before climbing on the euthanize bandwagon.  I don't think euthanization has to hinge on physical illness/pain - aggression is a valid reason, esp. when a baby is at risk."
dogs,fc45pcs,t1_fc43hd0,1577407314.0,"Sometimes they're just incompetent, sometimes they're already secretly planning on handing a dog/cat to a specific person (esp if the animal is young and desirable, their longtime pals get first dibs to ""Foster fail!"" it), and sometimes it's just the rescue being insane.  I had a cat rescue try to cancel a kitten adoption at the last minute for specious reasons.  The foster just didn't like the adopter.  Adopter had sterling vet references, ideal home, perfect situation - foster disliked her and tried to torpedo the adoption.  One of the nastier things I've ever seen a rescue group do."
dogs,fc44syc,t1_fbx0jk7,1577406643.0,"You can debate my comment as you wish, but one part is 100% accurate and all the complaints about pit bulls being misowned and unwuved doesn't erase it -  Melissa Astacio is dead at 44, having been attacked without provocation and then mauled to death by her long-time pet pit bull in front of her daughter.    

As to the rest of it - she is roughly the 40th person this year in the US to have been killed by 1 or more pit bulls.  There have been no comparable killings by cats, by Springer Spaniels, Labs, etc.  Given that 50% of US pit bull population is at any given time confined behind shelter wire and that all other breeds/types are not uniformly owned by perfect owners, this is a very big indication that there is a unique violence problem with them.  This problem is not magically erased by having white, educated, middle-class professionals buying them.  It's not magically erased when a Standard Schnauzer blows the reservation and eats a toddler.  It's not magically erased when any individual pit bulls spend their entire lives atypically in one home without causing any problems.  It's also not erased by vet techs going online to spout off about pitties being misunderstood and shrugging off the nightmarish violence of this breed against their own species with the blithe ""maybe more dog aggressive. That's all."""
dogs,fc43yjm,t1_fbwx1rv,1577406011.0,"Yes, the pit bull's 'trigger' for killing its owner was her having a medical emergency.  It's interesting that you regard that as a triumphantly explanatory detail I left out in an effort to slander pit bulls more thoroughly.  Most people would find that detail more damning about pit bulls, given that it's almost unheard-of for a pet dog to respond to its owner in distress by killing her.  Lassie, quit ragging Timmy!  No, girl!"
dogs,fc42dn3,t1_fbyrgga,1577404816.0,"This is a dog subred, not a pit bull subred.  If anyone doesn't belong here, it's pit bull owners, who choose a breed that targets and kills dogs at a horrifying rate."
