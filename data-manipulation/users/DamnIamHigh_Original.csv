Lately they reduced the speed to 40 kph on a main road (25mph) and expect it to flow better. Jep. Sure.

There is a reason why our City is called Traffic light Town.

Public transport is terrible and overpriced, trains are even worse, so the car is the only way you can get reliable from A to B here (city wise).

Expect that the other person may lack the knowledge you have.


No. I asked for proof but never got one of his Statements about the holocaust etc.
