AskReddit,fglluut,t3_ez3ggj,1580903708.0,"When I was in college, I was at a party and I found out that my then boyfriend had lavaliered me. So, I’m pretty buzzed but I decide to drive to his workplace. I had a shitty car with a questionable started. I stalled at a major intersection and couldn’t restart the car. I put on my hazards, popped the hood, grabbed my trusty screwdriver and wavered out to try to start the car from under the hood. In the intersection. 

Three cop cars pull up behind me. They ask me what I’m doing. With my best “I’m not drunk” smile, I tried to explain. They asked if I had a Triple A card and I did but for some reason, I kept trying to hand them 25 cents. The cops then let me steer the car while they pushed it off the road. My boyfriend was on his way home and saw us. He pulled over and asked if I was being arrested. I didn’t know. One of the cops asked him if he knew me and if he was taking me home. I laughed. 

How did they not arrest me?"

Her hair is completely matted due to filthiness. 

She wears the same pair of black stretch pants every day. The crotch of these pants are greenish/yellow. I just thought she had worn them down.

Ass boogers are a real problem when you can’t wipe yourself and the nuggies get stuck in the folds down there. I hate that I know that.

Let them have whatever they want. 

A lot of vets will push for extending their lives no matter what the cost. I used to work for an old country vet that knew when a pets time was up and instead of pushing heroic measures, he’d gently tell the owner it was time for mercy. I always respected him for that. 

It will hurt me when that day comes for Ragbag, but it would hurt me more to see her in pain. And you can see it in their eyes. Begging you to take the pain away. I’ll remember that she lived her best life up until the end."

These two were there at least once a month, both with puncture wounds in their necks. Apparently, the owners both worked long hours during the day and left the dogs cooped up with no toys or someone to let them outside. They also had only done minimal training. 

Eventually, one of the dogs bit the wife pretty badly after she tried to break up a fight. A few months down the road, one of the Akita’s ended up with rabies.

He said my friend couldn’t handle his “girth” and he hoped I could. I kicked him and cussed him out. He seemed genuinely confused. I grabbed my keys and went to get my friend. She was passed out on his bed, bleeding from where he had torn her open trying to get his nasty dick inside her.
