Somebody on trial for murder, with enough evidence to put them away for life. Suddenly a new witness comes forward with new evidence. You’d put that guy on the stand to make sure that every little bit of evidence was seen and heard. Or would you say “why are you so desperate to put see more evidence? Clearly that guy isn’t guilty or else you wouldn’t care if we heard about the shitty things he did”?"

Maybe just try taking to real people. My guess here is that you’ve seen these opinions mostly online. These appear to be some fringe extreme “leftist” opinions, and you probably shouldn’t pay them much mind the same way you wouldn’t pay much attention to a white guy with torch getting mad about a movie character being transgender.

The “courtyard outside the office will most likely feel dark and cramped. Maybe if you make the two exterior walls of the office glass it would make the deck feel more open but that’s a lot of cash money right there.

Kitchen should always be close to the garage/entrance imo. Why do you want to carry your groceries through you *entire house*? I’d put that at the front. 

Does that bathroom open to outside? Kinda odd.

You can put her on any third as long as it makes sense in the image. Sorry I don’t have a more solid answer but there isn’t really a “right answer” here."

1.	Correct your verticals
2.	try to get a more interesting/compelling angle. This strikes me as “we were climbing together so I snapped a quick pic”. More of a snapshot than a purposeful image
3.	play with wider angles, closer to the subject to really exaggerate that height
4.	do a little reading in composition if you haven’t. Rule of thirds will take you a long way.
5.	don’t be afraid to play with your time curve and other settings in post"
