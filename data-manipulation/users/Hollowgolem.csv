If you enjoy turn-based Final Fantasies, especially in the SNES era, then you owe it to yourself to play *Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals* by Neverland.  It's the prequel to the original *Lufia and the Fortress of Doom* (which is inferior in every way, and should definitely be avoided because of spoilery things at the very start of the game).  This thing adds elements of Zelda-style room puzzles, turn-based Final-Fantasy-esque combat (with the IP system predating FFVII-style limits and being more robust, I think), and even a monster-training element (FOOMY!) for your alternate characters.

The first time I cried at a video game was the finale of this one.  It hits hard, especially if you haven't played the previous game (I hadn't).  Seriously, don't look up story spoilers.  Great narrative, fun gameplay, and stylized-enough graphics that they hold up.  And if you REALLY want a head-trip, play the GameBoy Color sequel, *Lufia: The Legend Returns*, a turn-based RPG that allows you to have NINE characters in battle simultaneously.

Speaking of big battles and Final Fantasy, who here knew that the awful *Left Alive* that came out this year, and was widely regarded as one of the worst things Squeenix has done since not properly finishing *Xenogears* (also a game worth playing, by the way, if you haven't, despite its flaws) was a sequel to the legitimately great *Front Mission* series.  There are a bunch I could recommend, but *Front Mission 4* for the PS2 was my favorite, from gameplay to presentation to plot.  It's a typical grid-based tactical RPG like Tactics Ogre or Fire Emblem.  But it has MECHS!  So yeah, think Battletech, but still on Earth.  FM4 follows a war in Venezuela, and was some of the most fun I ever had with a PS2 game.  Square gets praise for their other tactical RPGs a lot, but the Front Mission series (3 and 4 especially) are sort of the unsung heroes of their library."

But beyond all that, who said socialist states are failures?  Look at what Cuba and Venezuela's socialist regimes accomplished in terms of healthcare and literacy DESPITE constant attempted sabotage from the CIA.  Look at the constant external threat from the US (Operation Condor, Bay of Pigs, etc.).  

Look at what the Soviets accomplished in half a century of socialism.  They took a backwater eastern European state from a waning empire to literally the second-most-powerful country on the world, leading the space race for all but the last leg, and basically solved Russia's food access problem through central planning.  I don't even LIKE the Bolsheviks (because I don't like the way they implemented socialism, their support for the Spanish Fascists under Franco, and I think the Ukrainian Free State, which they conquered, was a better model for communism), but I can't deny the amazing things they accomplished.

We can talk about Cuban health care, which is absolutely spectacular given the resources they have to work with.  The Cubans are even doing cutting-edge medical research, including [inventing stuff we can't access](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/09/cuba-has-lung-cancer-vaccine-many-u-s-patients-cant-get-without-breaking-law/1019093001/) because of the embargo.

The biggest issue with socialism so far is that it's been implemented by tyrannical, top-down attempts at imposing it, rather than through an organic process, and in already-impoverished countries (basically, socialism usually doesn't take hold unless material conditions are such that the people are clamoring for it en masse, but by that point, the country doesn't have much in the way of resources).  Maybe we're just too impatient and complacent.  I mentioned the Ukrainian situation.  If you're interested in looking at what I think is probably the best potential form of socialism, look up the anarcho-communists, like Kropotkin and Bookchin."

The idea that a woman has enough control of her body to opt out of an unwanted pregnancy is anathema to them.

What I am saying is that yes greater perspective and knowledge is helpful but there always may be a layer of perspective and knowledge higher than that. Also what Copernicus and Galileo did was precisely to debunk the establishment of people who also thought they were enlightened.

There actually was heleocentric theory soon to come, in the Hellenistic period.  Guy named Aristarchus of Samos.  Lucretius, an Epicurean, dismissed geocentrism as well (though he didn't offer a heliocentric alternative; he just thought the planets and stars bounced randomly around space because he didn't have a concept of gravity)."

Socrates challenged the people with power, and got murdered for it.  It wasn't about sharing knowledge, except inasmuch as that knowledge subverted traditional power structures.

You'll note that Aristotle, who was much better at licking Macedonian boots than Socrates was at licking Athenian ones, was not murdered.

If you explain things to people with no actual value to their concept of the cosmos, your explanation is useless to them.

You exit the cave into a larger, brighter cave.  There are still shadows flickering on the wall, rather than actual shapes.  But now they're coming from a different angle.  The labrynthine path leads out to a still larger cave.

It's why I laugh when someone says that they are ""unbiased.""  We are all biased, in every interpretation of everything.  We may not be in the deepest, darkest cave, but we're still in one, still grasping at shadows trying to figure out the forms they represent.  The trick is to compare those biases.  What do the shadows look like in your cave versus my cave?

AskReddit,fdcz6mu,t1_fdcqvpp,1578288722.0,">It will always be better to have a high amount of knowledge about a specific subject than having a slightly above average amount of knowledge about multiple subjects (that you'll forget in a couple of months after you graduate anyway).

I disagree strongly with this.  Having a broad knowledge base helps you determine the value of information in those subjects.  Any subject about which you know absolutely nothing you can easily be deceived in.  It's good to have at least some baseline so you can make a judgment about the info you're sifting through.

>Anything you can learn in school can easily be found out in less than a minute with a Google search. So why have it memorized when you can look it up at any time. The people making standards for education are the same ones that used to tell us we had to know how to do division long hand because we'll never be walking around with a calculator in our pockets.

...related to the earlier point, a good teacher isn't making you memorize shit, but gain skills.  Sometimes, you need to know some things to develop those skills, and sometimes the exact skill itself will be less useful than the meta-skills that it will develop (I teach Latin, and my former students have told me how valuable the way I taught them to analyze and recontextualize a sentence during the translation process ended up being in future communication-oriented careers).  

Or, hell, sometimes, a skill you didn't think you'd need can just straight-up be useful.  I never thought I'd use my calculus, but then I had a shitty retailed job and used integration based on previous sales figures to help my manager set up a more functional schedule instead of her janky-ass inefficient system of basing hours on the previous week's sales."

My kids aren't stupid, they just don't give any shits about anything.  Part of it is how easily they can be distracted now, and how powerless I am to actually do anything about those distractions.

I'm not allowed to yank AirPods out of heads, for example, or lock phones up in my desk.  District policy.  But it's my fault when those kids fail, despite the fact that I've called their parents once a week to no result, and they have refused to come to any conferences I've requested.
