Half way through the month, the user wants another three users so adds them. At the end of the month, what do I bill the user for? Obviously the five original users, but what about the three ones added halfway through the month? Are these billed for a half a month? Do I generate a seperate invoice for these in another half month (1 full month after they were created)? Is there some standard to handle this?

This would probably be too slow:

    select *
    from Tbl
    where not exists(
        select * 
        from Tbl as PriorRows 
        where PriorRows.Policy_Number = Tbl.Policy_Number 
            and PriorRows.Type < Tbl.Type
    )

Basically this selects rows that do not have a ""lower"" (i.e. previous) Type field. These rows correspond to the ""first"" row (first also means ""has no prior entries""). Sometimes thinking about ""first"" in this way helps illuminate what you're trying to do.

Note this would run into problems if there are duplicate Policy_Number and Type records (both would get selected). You'd need to add a tie breaking condition to adjust for this.

The query can be transformed from a subquery to an outer join:

    select *
    from Tbl
        left outer join Tbl as PriorRows
            on PriorRows.Policy_Number = Tbl.Policy_Number
                and PriorRows.Type < Tbl.Type
    where PriorRows.Type is null

This is roughly speaking a type of Cartesian join. Each Policy_Number is joined to the same Policy_Number but with a lower/early Type. The entry that doesn't have a PriorRows is the ""First"".

Not sure how this would perform either. You'd need to study the execution plan's pretty carefully."

SQLServer,fdq8qip,t3_elxvey,1578659458.0,"How many tables are in the db? And of those how many are configuration vs actual data?

I'm wondering whether just building a dedicated bit of code to do a database export would be worthwhile. Basically the code would need to do:

* load the database schema (including foreign keys)
* sort the schema based on dependencies (topological sort)
* export the schema (eg. ""create table x ..."")
* loop through each table and do the following:
* - select either all records or a representative sample
* - export the records as SQL (eg. ""insert into x (...) values (...)"")

I've done the above for a small application of 300 odd tables with the vast majority being configuration-ish and only a small core (half a dozen or so) being data intensive.

What I really like about this bit of code:

* Customer support starts with ""send us your configuration""
* The configuration is striped of some data elements (eg. password to a smtp server)
* Support can load a complete working configuration using SMSS (or cmd line if really big)

What's annoying about this code:

* Need to keep it in mind when upgrading schema elements. 98% of the time don't need to do anything (because the schema export and data export ""just work"")... but sometimes a bit of adjustment is needed.

So... rather than look for an existing tool maybe just spend the effort to create one dedicated to exactly what you need. The above wasn't tricky code to write, though exporting the schema was a pain (saved by not have a super complicated schema... some views, some functions, some sp, but that's about it). The most tricky part was streaming the raw SQL output through compression and down to the browser on the fly (saves on runtime memory and doesn't need to create a file on the server)."

    select ...
    from tbl

One reason to calculate the starting point, @FirstDateOfPeriod, is to ensure that any index on the DateField can be utilized. Solutions that perform math on the DateField itself, eg ""datediff(mm, recorddate, ..."",  and ""MONTH(Field)"", preclude the possibility of using an index.

Note you could make the calculation of @FirstDateOfPeriod inline:

    dateadd(mm, -2, dateadd(dd, -1 * day(getdate()) + 1, cast(floor(cast(getdate() as float)) as datetime)))

But... tricky to understand. And it uses two invocations of getdate() which always makes me wonder exactly how SQL handles getdate() in queries. Will all invocations of getdate() in a query have the same value? Am I willing to bet on it?"
