dogs,ff8yft9,t1_ff7lmte,1579700077.0,Thank you! We have a blast at practice!
dogs,ff7das4,t1_ff6qtyp,1579646901.0,"Thank you! The team seems so open and encouraging, I really hope we can meet their expectations. 
And I hope you get a chance to join your trainer's team! What other sports are you thinking about?"
dogs,ff7cwvc,t1_ff6pw0n,1579646640.0,"Thank you! As much as I want her to just chill out, I think it's endearing how happy she gets when she's acknowledged by someone. In her head she is technically standing sooo.. it counts, right? 😅"
dogs,ff6cxh7,t3_erv5qp,1579624470.0,"I'm still stoked about the offer to join the local flyball team. Honestly, if we do this it makes it easier for me to justify taking some time off from agility. I have been back and forth on it because it would overlap with our competition obedience class. And we just really need the practice in a ring during class if I do want to maybe trial. I have also considered rally trials in the meantime while we work on our stand for exam issues.

Speaking of that, we went on a 5+ mile hike and I barely had enough time to eat and go to obedience class. The instructor gave all the dogs (and humans) cookies because it was her dogs birthday. Then we had stand for exam as our first exercise and.. Olive stood as I left her. But then she started full body wiggling and leaned against the instructor's leg and smiled up at her new favorite ""cookie lady"". So that was a failure lmao."
dogs,ff36w4v,t1_fezox41,1579535115.0,"Oh thank you for sharing that info with us! I had heard of culture passes, but I never really looked into it. And I had know idea you could check online. We will definitely have to try and go next time they host a dog day!"
dogs,ff369q7,t3_erdo6e,1579534691.0,"Yesterday was our last intro flyball class and the trainer asked me to stay after class. They want Olive and I to attend their team practice and to seriously consider joining the team! I'm SO thrilled. I told them we would totally be willing to commit to that. ❤


Also, we had a big group of young unsupervised kids rush us on a walk yesterday. Olive just wiggled, gave kisses, and basked in the attention. I still think she'd be a great therapy dog if she could control her excitement. Olive brings a **lot** of zest to everything in life.


We are going hiking again today! Spoiled dog."
dogs,feywp8e,t1_feyun76,1579451477.0,"Hey! Another AZ person. Willow is super cute! Was it crowded when you went/was it worth the price? I haven't gone to the botanical garden in years, but going with my dog sounds so much fun."
dogs,fenb61w,t1_fen7m3q,1579280926.0,"Oh absolutely! I am totally with you. I think this club is very extreme. I told the director it just wasn't happening when they gave us a big list of equipment to have at home. She kept trying to suggest places I could put it (under our bed, in a storage closet, etc. we don't even have a bed that has an ""under"" area lmao). 😬

Before I joined this place I asked classmates at my old facility about them and I got kind so-so responses. I am so glad I started at my old place, but it was more than double what I am paying now so I had to make the switch if I wanted a budget for other sports. So I take what I can get. 

Old dog ladies are super hardcore. 😂"
dogs,fen6llb,t1_femwiix,1579278106.0,I'll trade you trainers! Our facility wants people training 4 times a week. I have no yard and no equipment (I have a set of weaves). So I lie about doing homework. 😧
dogs,fejs4b7,t3_epjsw5,1579184488.0,"We did some scentwork and then went out to a dog friendly pub last night. I'm happy to say she was the most well behaved dog on the patio. I snuck her a fry or two for being a good girl.


Edit: Also, my SO occasionally sends me pictures of the cats and Olive cuddling together. In the most recent update, Olive was spooning with the cat again and it's so flippin' adorable. I love that the cats are bonding with her."
Whatcouldgowrong,fei0pzo,t1_fei0ivf,1579127760.0,"And you know she does this.. based on her appearance?

Hmmmmmmm."
Whatcouldgowrong,fei06u1,t1_fehyv6y,1579127442.0,">**She looks like** the type of girl that **judges others heavily based on their appearance**.

Hmmmmmmmmm.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm."
dogs,fedlm4n,t3_eolqbc,1579014553.0,"Went on a nice hike yesterday and it tired Olive out pretty well. Not dog related, but I really hate my job. However, I get Mondays off and it's the best day for hiking. I'm still not sure it makes up for the fact that I feel like I'm dying inside everyday I come to work. I used to have anxiety attacks every morning before and now that only happens sometimes so.. improvement I guess?

After talking about it with my SO, I decided to sign up for the pre-novice obedience class with our club. We had our first class last night (in the scary park, police were on site hanging around atleast). And I am honestly so glad I signed up. The instructor is giving really helpful tips for trialing, so maybe that will be in our future?"
dogs,fea2482,t1_fe9y22i,1578943577.0,"Ahh that's great! Last time we went we gave up when we went because there was a crowd. 

If you are ever in AZ again and you're looking for a sweet non-Sedona hike in the future, check out Tonto Natural Bridge. It's incredible."
dogs,fe8u5gk,t1_fe8omv2,1578930915.0,"Nice! You really can't go wrong with Sedona hikes.

I love West Fork. It was also closed when we went for the New Year (we still did part of it it because everyone else was hiking it anyway). If you go back you need to check it out, it is worth it if you keep going some distance after the maintained trail ends. We have hiked it every season and it never gets old. 

Was there a line of people waiting to get a picture on Devil's Bridge?"
dogs,fe8qtif,t3_eo4le6,1578929513.0,"Olive is killing it at flyball class, we have 1 week left. I'm most thrilled with her ""dead ball/toy"" retrieve over a jump. She obviously enjoys herself! Apparently they won't be holding a formal session for the next level while they head into tournament season. So it's only drop ins from time to time if we want to keep practicing. 

I'm thinking about also suffering through the long drive and taking a barn hunt introduction class for funsies since they hold drop ins. I'm trying to dabble in everything this year to see what's out there."
dogs,fe8o2s1,t1_fe8l2io,1578928385.0,I love Sedona! Did you hike and notable trails?
dogs,fdwsdov,t1_fdwltsj,1578761920.0,"I really understand why some people don't even train it. The teeter has a really negative effect on sound sensitive dogs that have been in class with us. 
When I was taking indoor classes the teeter would be SO loud. One dog hated the teeter sound so much that if other dogs were even near the teeter it would shut down the entire class. She would skip training that obstacle, but over the course of a a couple months ALL agility equipment became SO aversive to that dog (since other teams still had to practice the teeter). She had to pull the dog from classes because the dog was very aggitated just entering the building.

I spent longer than we probably needed to building Olive up for the full height. And I pray we never have any accidents that cause an issue in the future. I was so paranoid and I'm still pretty cautious about the whole thing. 

My instructor sometimes refers to targets as dog magnets and I think that's accurate. Such a strong reward history that it just sucks them in. Can't even be mad because they are just doing what they were trained to. I pretty was amused. 😂"
dogs,fdwha8x,t3_en7tuf,1578758680.0,"It's so awesome seeing how crazy Olive is for the full-height teeter in agility now. She just beams confidence. 

On a funny note, our instructur sometimes uses her binder as a target for the dogs and had it laying between a couple obstacles. She tried to put it up on a table specifically so the dogs wouldn't send to it. Well, Olive shot out of the tunnel, saw the binder on the table (not an agility table) and launched herself up on there before I realized and proudly looked at me like, ""This is what you wanted right??"". I mean it made sense from her perspective. 😂

Edit: [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/co75WuH) that Olive and our kitty love eachother. Sometimes our other kitty joins in and our couch turns into a cuddle party with no room for the humans."
k9sports,fdred71,t3_emv9oq,1578683324.0,"Not at all. Go ahead and do all the sports! My dog does agility, obedience, flyball, nosework, and tricks. We train all of these in the same week and it has never hurt her agility progress. Each sport has a different objective, but I've found a lot of the skills you train overlap and only strengthen their working ability. Go for it."
dogs,fdozx9l,t1_fdou5lh,1578616713.0,Me too! It's so much fun seeing her enjoy herself. I'm considering looking into in person classes eventually too!
dogs,fdni48n,t1_fdnh6a4,1578586283.0,Good to know! Maybe I'll just go for the cheaper versions I keep considering on amazon and save my money for other unnecessary dog purchases.
dogs,fdngtnt,t1_fdnfz80,1578585504.0,"She sounds like a very inspirational coach.

I'm so envious. Are the prices worth it on the brand name stuff? Those items sit indefinitely on my wishlist. I tell myself I can't justify starting a collection when my dog training stuff continues to slowly take up more and more space in our tiny ass apartment. And now I have an absurd collection of boxes for nosework so it just gets worse."
dogs,fdnfwae,t1_fdnevo1,1578584943.0,"Maybe. It feels so silly. 😂 I have thought about doing dog yoga in the park, and I don't know if I have reached that level of DGAF."
dogs,fdnfpux,t1_fdnf0hl,1578584834.0,It's like she's your personal coach. The GSP workout plan. Also is that some FitPaws I see back there? Want.
dogs,fdnegkn,t1_fdncxb6,1578584066.0,"When I use a balance disc Olive just gives me a dirty look if I don't let her have her turn. If I step off for a second she steals my spot. So now I pull out two discs, one for me and one for her and we balance together. 😂"
dogs,fdne5m2,t1_fdnc65y,1578583878.0,"Yeah, no problem!"
dogs,fdnaeyg,t1_fdn84zn,1578581478.0,You should totally do it! I am taking a nosework class online through [Fenzi Dog Sports Academy](https://www.fenzidogsportsacademy.com/)  . You just need to get the supplies they list for the course and you are good to go. We took NW101 to start with.
dogs,fdn7oks,t3_ema4ga,1578579528.0,"Olive has built up crazy drive to do nosework since we started. She gets as amped about it as she does for agility. I mean, of course she loves it she always gets intense about working. 

I'm just so thrilled how confident she is with her searches. Even when I try to set up problems that might throw her off, she figures it out and she has a VERY clear indication. We will definitely be doing the next level, this is a new favorite game for her."
dogs,fdi70kw,t3_eliy5c,1578436863.0,"Nope. Dogs don't need another dog in their life to be happy. I don't have studies, but I like the message this [article](https://acmecanine.com/dog-really-need-companion-reality-owning-second-dog/) has about getting a second dog.

Get a second dog because you want a second dog, not because your partner thinks your dog wants a dog."
dogs,fdhaprx,t3_elemx1,1578418995.0,"It sounds like you're doing everything just fine, don't stress yourself out about it. You can always spend a little time training fun things like tricks to give him some mental challenges on days you have other plans. Or even look into dog sports if you want the extra challenge. It can be just as tiring as exercise for a lot of dogs. In the end, dogs usually spend a whole lot of time just snoozing or chilling anyway. You are entitled to still have weekends out even if you have a dog. You seem like a good owner already. :)"
dogs,fdh6to6,t1_fdh5gjb,1578416631.0,"I have the same mindset about Facebook. I literally only use it for dog related stuff anymore because it's what all the local clubs use to make updates about classes/trials. I wish it wasn't that way, but it forces me to stay. 😥"
dogs,fdh5g41,t1_fdh41wf,1578415781.0,"Nice! I took classes with a trainer that showed us all the methods. We did 2x2s, channels, and those weave-o-matic poles. I think it really solidified weaves for us and I would totally go through it all again."
dogs,fdh48y3,t1_fdgyxfd,1578415044.0,She also runs a co-operative care facebook group if you're not already in it.
dogs,fdh2268,t3_elc0og,1578413691.0,"Flyball class was good, obedience was good. We finished the last class, but I might skip the next OB session because the parks department designated them to the dreaded scary park at again. Not my favorite place for night classes. Great proofing practice for gunshots, random brawls, and police patrols (which all have happened while class was going on). 😒

Agility is also back on. Our fenzi nosework class is wrapping up. Now I have to decide if I want to do the next nosework level or take that novice prep fenzi class. I can only pick one, I know I just won't have the time to focus on both. I am actually leaning towards nosework because I don't want to stall her progress if I don't have more material to work on if that makes sense?"
dogs,fdh0f19,t1_fdgz6dg,1578412648.0,"Makes sense with that delicate skin. #sighthoundproblems 

If you get desperate, somebody sells these [scrunchy/covers](https://www.etsy.com/listing/575202882/prong-collar-cover-or-sleeve-scrunchie-w?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=prong+collar+cover&ref=sr_gallery-1-5&col=1) which is probs cheaper than a curogan collar."
dogs,fdgysup,t1_fdgw0im,1578411621.0,Have you tried the curogan version instead maybe?
dogs,fd50lud,t1_fd3y0ll,1578172986.0,I got my dog the same toy and she prefers the nylon loop over the ball for some reason.  It's cut/rubbed her gums before when she tugs hard enough so I sort of don't use it much.
dogs,fd2qe48,t3_ejw299,1578150664.0,[White Pine](https://www.whitepineoutfitters.com/index.cfm) has collars designed specifically to avoid fur breakage with dogs like samoyeds in mind. I think they do ship to Europe.
dogs,fcyj6kx,t1_fcybtku,1578080963.0,"I've taken classes at two different clubs and one of the clubs is like, ""You need weaves NOW, NOW, NOW"" and they expect everyone to have it in 2 weeks via 2x2 method. Which is totally possible, but I don't think it's reasonable for every team to hit that time-frame.

I like agility, but a lot of the training directors in my area are just too intense and it squashes people who just want to do it for fun."
dogs,fckag9f,t3_ehmhat,1577720853.0,"Flyball was cancelled yesterday, which was a bummer, but next week I'll be back to 3 different classes again. Olive got a few hours at the park and a bunch of nosework practice instead. She was so tired by the end of the day she didn't care the cat was practically sitting on her head while she slept.

Today we'll be driving up north to get some hiking in before the end of the year. I might take Olive to the massive pet store warehouse and grab some goodies for her this morning before we head out."
dogs,fc9f30j,t1_fc6y0ux,1577551732.0,"She looked even more like a border collie as a puppy. She had white socks and a white chest/neck that eventually turned dark grey.

Right now we are focusing on using nosework for mental exercise. We have other sports me practice in, but I think nosework really inspires some extra thinking on the dog's part. You might want to give it a try if you haven't.

I also never feed Olive from a bowl. It's either for training or puzzles.

- One game I really like is having her in a stay out of sight and I will go and hide her kibble in hidden locations for her to sniff out. You can slowly make it harder by hiding pieces under objects or on elevated locations. 

- I also like teaching her the names of objects/toys and have her place them in a bucket. I teach it all through shaping and it's really fun to see her work through the problem.

- This is more in the realm of conditioning, but I bought some of those exercise wobble cushions and I have her balance on them. It actually does add some mental challenge in because they need to focus on their rear and front foot placement to balance. You can increase or decrease the difficulty by add or removing air in the cushions.

- Dog parkour. Seriously. Instead of just taking your dog on a walk, teach them commands to go up onto, or into objects you find. Believe it or not, you can submit dog parkour videos online and earn ribbons and titles for it. 

Hope one of those interests you!"

Wisdom Panel claimed wirehair dachshund and bichon frise.

The only thing in common between the two was the chow chow, staffordshire terrier, and the australian cattle dog.

There might be some similarity, but I would say there is a notable disparity."
dogs,fc6srs7,t1_fc6ppa7,1577488553.0,"Thank you! Yes, she is brilliant. I have to come up with new ways to challenge her brain. She always does so well in all her training classes.

I love mutts, and Olive is the mutt-iest mutt I've ever owned."
dogs,fc6f314,t1_fc6dxud,1577479066.0,"Yeah, I wouldn't say she is really any specific breed after seeing both results. The percentages are so small for any given breed so I guess she's just a variety pack kind of mutt."
dogs,fc341g6,t3_efvtbm,1577380928.0,"Olive got to romp around with my bf's sister's dogs on Christmas. Both of her dogs compete in agility! I think Olive actually gets along best with the 12 yr old dog. The older dog has 4 agility championships in different venues and just has that puppy enthusiasm despite his salt and pepper muzzle. I hope Olive ends up being that fit at his age. Love those dogs. It was nice they that they could handle her energy, she can really be a hyper knucklehead sometimes.

Edit: I also got Olive's Embark health results and she is clear of all diseases they test for. We get to find out her breed results really soon!"
