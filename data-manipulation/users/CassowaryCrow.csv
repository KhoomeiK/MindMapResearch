news,ffotb5a,t1_ffnp00w,1580081497.0,"There should be no shame in giving up an animal. Maybe I'm biased because we had to give up two family dogs when I was little, (unrelated reasons-the first had issues with children in a house of three, soon to be four kids, and the second had issues that we couldn't help her with,) but I believe that sometimes, giving up an animal is the best thing you can do for them."

news,ffnlzht,t1_ffn4rzx,1580067656.0,"It depends. The shelter I worked at couldn't turn away any animal, and didn't charge for strays (they did for surrenders I think, but people would just drop off ""strays"" to bypass the fee). We still had animals show up abandoned in the parking lot, or that were found tied up somewhere. I think for some people they're too ashamed to surrender their animals in person, because they feel like failures. Or they're just assholes. (Ftr I don't think there's any shame in having to give up an animal, but I've seen enough posts on subs like offmychest and amitheasshole about it to know that others to.)"

pokemonrng,ff3rugf,t1_fernfo2,1579547491.0,"So the spawn percentages you see are actually a little confusing. Charizard is a 5%, but that actually means he's 5% of 5 star raids, not 5% of all raids. Assuming 3, 4, and 5 star raids have the same odds of spawn, Charizard is actually closer to a 1.7% spawn."

I know that (if my memory of high school history class serves correctly,) most slave owners had very *few* slaves, but just because you only own three human beings, doesn't mean you treat them much better than the guy who owns eighty."
bestof,fepcdsy,t1_fep1tsu,1579317073.0,"The term incel was coined by a woman to create a support group for people that could not find partners, mainly because of disabilities (I think?) Over time, the term has evolved, and it has been claimed by a much different population.

There's nothing wrong with being unable to find a partner. There's nothing wrong with being involuntarily celibate. But I wouldn't use the term incel, unless you subscribe to the movement, and realize that that's how most people use the term as well. When somebody says incels are terrible, they're not talking about people like you, or me, they're talking about angry boys and men on the internet that idolize monsters like Eliot Rodgers."

It looks like what puts you lower on the list is opting out by registering an objection, but I don't object to donations, I'm just not allowed. Would I have to opt out? What if I promised to donate my organs for scientific testing instead? Am I exempt? I don't see anything in the article leaning either way. Idk.

I realize that this is almost entirely hypothetical but I am very curious."
