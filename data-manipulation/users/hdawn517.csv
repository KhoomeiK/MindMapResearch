Right before fall semester started I ended up dying my hair bright orange. A few weeks later I saw my usual stylist and she asked me what happened. I legit just said I had a mental breakdown lol. Luckily she understood :)
PharmacySchool,ffbzewh,t3_esp184,1579787540.0,I would keep your job and just talk to your managers to see if they would let you work 1-2 shifts a week. It's still a bit stressful but its manageable.

I probably cried for the first week or two after my back surgery because it's so tiring trying to heal and deal with the world. I hope you find some time to relax and sleep, as well as recover easily. I also hope everything else works out for your family."
Vent,fesoc05,t3_eqak2z,1579367378.0,I lost my hedgie a couple years ago. I got him as a baby and loved him so much. I sat in the vets office for about a hour crying until I finally went home after putting him down. It's tough and I'm so sorry for your loss.
NoStupidQuestions,felunw9,t3_eptbpr,1579231368.0,This is actually a great question.

I will be thinking of you but I know you can do it"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fekix6o,t3_epj7gg,1579200999.0,"My husband quit his job after 6 years with the company. He was been unemployed since October 2019. After the first week or two, he would say how he misses work and maybe he would just go back. I think it's more because he was feeling useless since he had no income coming into our household. But the job was really bringing him down and he wasnt in a good mental spot, which is why he quit. Maybe you're feeling similar? I am working very part time right now (one day a week) because I'm in grad school as well, but sometimes I feel guilty for not working as much."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feff1ur,t3_eotbrk,1579054954.0,There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You are beautiful. You dont have to be feminine to be a woman. But what I think you should do is start practicing some self care. This is my biggest goal for 2020 and it's nothing too crazy. I am just going to hold myself to washing my face every night before bed and getting my hair trimmed when its needed. Being you is not a bad thing !

college,fee96tj,t3_eomjwv,1579028988.0,I study at least 2 hours every night (except Saturday or Sunday). It kind of just depends on what class is more depending and how hard the content is. I feel like I have gotten better studying but maybe not more efficient. I am probably not human anymore.

Do I get stressed? Hell yeah. Will I be super relieved when its over?  Definitely. But I'm glad I am pushing myself to finish.

backpain,fdcboyn,t3_eklqg9,1578271091.0,Havent been on it but I am a pharmacist intern. Any sort of antidepressant (no matter what it's being used for) needs to be tapered off. I would maybe call your doc and let them know about the bad side effects you are feeling and ask what a proper taper would be.
