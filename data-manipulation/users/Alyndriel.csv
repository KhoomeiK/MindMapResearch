SandersForPresident,ff6o6f3,t3_erxi91,1579631374.0,"Don’t feel bad! You did the brave and grownup thing to do and changed your mind when presented with new evidence. Once upon a time (OK, high school) I was a staunch single issue voter. I changed my perspective as I got older and became more informed. I know it sounds cheesy, but this random internet person is proud of you. I teach political science and am holding out hope that when people learn more they do better things. That’s worlds better than some of the Trump supporters I know who seem to double down every time he does another awful thing. 

Find a way that you can be involved that is meaningful to you. For me, it’s working with my local Indivisible group when I can, making $5 donations when I can, and getting as many people registered to vote as possible. If we turn up we can do this!"
TrueOffMyChest,ff3qsob,t3_eqzv8h,1579546849.0,"Sending so many hugs to you and your partner. Once upon a time, if we were friends I probably would have encouraged you to have the baby and then put it up for adoption. I’m sorry about that. Seriously. Can adoption be a good option? Yep. Is it the only valid choice? Abso-fucking-lutely not. I’ve grown up since those long ago early teenage days, and now realize 1) What a person wants to do with her body is her own damn business and 2) HER OWN DAMN BUSINESS. (I live in Oklahoma, I’ve got to say it louder for the people in the back.) 

It’s obvious that you didn’t just wake up and go, “Ha! I think I’ll pop out and have an abortion today, the weather’s so nice!” I’m so glad that you were able to make a decision that makes sense for you, and that your partner is so supportive.  Sending you all the best wishes for tomorrow - I hope it goes smoothly and that your recuperation is as painless as possible. I hope that someday when you guys are ready you’ll be able to start your family. Make sure you’ve got supplies at home: a heating pad, maxi pads, ibuprofen, etc., along with whatever comfy things that help you feel better like cozy blankets or warm socks. Take care of yourself tomorrow, throwing out a prayer to the universe for you."

suggestmeabook,feijais,t1_fehxqfb,1579139830.0,"Anything by Terry Pratchett is great. There’s a ton of different characters in Discworld, and there’s some that are stand alone. Reaper Man (it’s about Death), Good Omens (a comedy about Armageddon), and Wyrd Sisters (about the coolest coven of witches ever), and Jingo (a bit of a political thriller) are some of my favorites."
suggestmeabook,feiii8c,t1_fei1koq,1579139314.0,"Since you like Gaiman, check out Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. It’s a comedy about the end of the world and it’s fantastic."

The Priestess of Avalon, also by Marion Zimmer Bradley, is just a good female centered fantasy series."
suggestmeabook,feihs60,t1_fegtoe8,1579138836.0,"Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card and the subsequent books in that series. If a dark future is interesting to you, there’s plenty of that and tension between the dark and light in this series."

suggestmeabook,feihcy0,t1_fegrzy6,1579138561.0,"The Firebrand by Marion Zimmer Bradley. It’s a retelling of the story of the fall of Troy from the perspective of Kassandra, a priestess who is well connected to things at the palace. Marion Zimmer Bradley does a great job telling stories from a woman’s perspective. 

In the same vein, The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is one of my favorites. It’s the story of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah mentioned in the Old Testament. I guess this is technically historical fiction as its based on characters in the Bible, but it’s not a religious book."
suggestmeabook,feight2,t1_fei3otb,1579137983.0,"I second this one - I’ve really enjoyed that series. There’s quite a few, and it’s a urban fantasy kind of series. The magic system is well developed and interesting and I like the characters."

aww,fedz2o4,t3_eonffw,1579022914.0,"Happy gotcha day! My baby brother (OK, he just turned 21 and is about 5” taller than me, but I changed his diapers, so...) is adopted. The lady who helped my parents with his adoption said that biological kids are homegrown and adopted kids are handpicked. Both are wonderful, but the fact that you guys made a conscious decision to give a family to a little one who didn’t have one is a gorgeous thing. Sending you guys all the love!"
oddlyterrifying,fecajcy,t1_fec5yhp,1578969618.0,"Fair enough question. Cremation is better than conventional burial, with its embalming fluids and tons of concrete and casket. It does take a significant amount of fuel and puts out potentially nasty stuff into the air, like mercury from the older style metal fillings. Alkaline hydrolysis, aka aquamation, is a newish thing that’s supposed to be a more eco-conscious version of cremation. It’s only legal in a handful of states right now, but it could really be a sort of in-between option between cremation and natural burial. 

Here’s a link where Caitlin Doughty sketches out what aquamation would look like. She’s also got a 30-ish minute video about eco-conscious burial options.

Mental illness can be a beast, just like any chronic illness. It’s easy to think that whatever you’re experiencing is normal because we all have a sample size of 1 when it comes to knowing everything that goes on in a brain. I almost died from an eating disorder before my sister told me she was worried. Looking at things from her perspective is what got me to start treatment."

One of the things I’m working hard to teach my children is that every problem in the world would go away if we love each other. Wars? Nope. You can’t fight and bomb and kill people you love. Abusive governments? No. Abusive people? Nope. No starvation because we have plenty of food to share. No poverty because keeping people poor isn’t loving.  No ignoring climate change, because then we get whole countries on fire. 

Sending all the love to you, and I’m showing this whole thread to my kids when I pick them up today."

You are not required to give infinite chances for your stepdad to stop treating you like trash. Who cares if he’s technically family? So what? It’s OK to burn bridges that lead to horrible places. Have your uncle walk you down the aisle, just like you’ve dreamed, and enjoy your day with people who love and support you.  

If I were in your shoes, I would make sure that he isn’t at the wedding at all.  It sounds like your fiancé’s family and your friends are supportive - keep those people at the wedding and ban the jerk."

I have seen friends die from their eating disorders, and almost died myself. I normalized what I was doing too - since it WAS normal for me, even though it’s not normal at all. It is so hard to get outside of your head when you have disordered thinking - it’s hard for anyone. The longer you go the harder it gets to break out of it and the more damage you can do.

AskReddit,fbqisnb,t3_ee2ps8,1577032163.0,"I remember being in a mostly dark room with a bright screen - I asked my mom, and that was from when I had surgery to correct a double ureter I had on one kidney. I was three. 

The first memories I have that are clear and that I understand are snippets from a camping trip my Dad took me on for my 4th birthday. I remember sitting by the campfire eating apple chips while he set up. I remember my Care Bears sleeping bag, and that it rained all night but we stayed dry. I remember breakfast by the campfire and then hiking back while it poured rain.  I remember seeing blue paint marking the trail and finding a turtle. It had to be miserable for Dad hiking back, but I thought it was a great adventure. He died 15 years ago during my (first) senior year of college and his birthday is Christmas Eve. I miss him so much and memories like this are such treasures."
