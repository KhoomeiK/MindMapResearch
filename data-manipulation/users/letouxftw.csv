We have a YouTube channel called Squirmy and Grubs, where we share the ups and downs of our cute little life together. Our purpose is to break down the stigmas that exist around dating and disability.

We just found out today that our channel was nominated for a Shorty Award! It feels pretty surreal, and we couldn’t be more grateful for the nomination.

Our competition has WAY more subscribers than we do, so we don’t really intend to win. But we thought maybe if we can get some sort of viral boost to help propel our voting, it could be a huge win for disability in the media spotlight. If you’d like, you can vote for us once per day at the following link: [https://shortyawards.com/12th/squirmy-and-grubs](https://shortyawards.com/12th/squirmy-and-grubs)

Please check out our channel if you’re interested in learning more about our relationship: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdomP1JqhnyBQGaBmfDl4KQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdomP1JqhnyBQGaBmfDl4KQ)

Thank you!!!"

iamverysmart,fees8yn,t3_eosifb,1579040111.0,"Quick context: I’m a YouTuber with my fiancée, Hannah. I use a wheelchair because I was born with a muscle-wasting disease. Hannah is able-bodied, SO OBVIOUSLY, our relationship is just a scam to make money on YouTube. This “stalker” found my phone number and has been texting me photos from our youth (all publicly available photos lol) as if that somehow proves his ignorant theories about us.
