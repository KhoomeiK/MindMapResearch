therapy,fejrhya,t3_epe8bz,1579184029.0,"I relate to this. I have NEVER gotten over the discomfort of talking to a therapist, no matter how nice or pleasant they are. I always took Xanax to relax myself, not saying that’s a good thing to do though."

CPTSD,fe8hucq,t1_fe8f5lq,1578926324.0,"I very much understand. I have not cut myself, but have done things like dig my nails into my skin, scratch myself or peel the skin off the bottom of my feet until it is sometimes painful to walk. I’ve definitely thought about it for sure.....my biggest impediment is that I really didn’t want people to see or notice. I really hate attention. It’s strange, but probably my biggest motivating factor in me not cutting myself was not wanting others to know how suicidal I was, and possibly try to help me. I do very much understand why you would want to or have done so in the past, I get the emotional release aspect of it. As for the scars, I’ve known many people with self harm scars, and it never caused me to treat them any differently. I carry my scars internally and feel empathy for those with outward scars."

TalkTherapy,fe7ns1i,t1_fe6nfuv,1578917154.0,"Not sure why I feel a bit bitter and put off. I suppose it’s because I’ve never had a good experience with a therapist. I try very hard not to have expectations of people, but in the context of therapy, you kind of rely on this person for some kind of emotional strength or clarity. I am uncomfortable leaning on people in that way. His demeanor suggests he doesn’t have the time nor the patience to deal with someone like myself, who can be very defensive. I suppose, I want at least the illusion that this person gives a shit about me in some small way, and I’m not feeling it with this guy. Everyone has such glowing things to say about this man, and how amazing he is. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s had offers to have babies named after him! He seems beloved. I was already very cynical to start, and was already starting at a deficit, so now I think I’m done. I assume he won’t contact me again, since I was told to contact him when done. It gives me an easy out, since I’d rather avoid the whole thing now. I really don’t have the energy or the inclination to do this again with another person; I’m just going to assume some people can’t be helped by talk therapy."
Anxiety,fe6cl89,t3_env53v,1578887018.0,"Yes, I often vomit during an anxiety attack. Pretty embarrassing, and yes, people have thought I was being dramatic. The anxiety attack culminates with getting sick, then it’s pretty much over."

mentalhealth,fdpeuzi,t3_emivj0,1578626822.0,"I would think of myself as a unique person, and I think you should take the mental health diagnoses worth a grain of salt. Certain psychological problems are real, sure, but many of the personality disorders overlap in many ways. I like to think of them as artificial constructs. Two hundred years ago, you may have just been a person just a little ‘different,’ no terms attached normally unless you were totally insane, psychosis. An anthropology professor of mine said once that he theorized that most schizophrenic, or just ‘different’ people, became shamans  and healers in many cultures. My point being, everyone has a place in society, if society will allow it....and so do you. Also, I feel that many of the categories in the DSM could apply to many people at various times in their lives. Just try to keep going and not associate yourself with the labels they have give you."

I wish I was more productive when I’m not sleeping. I think the key is to not overthink it, if you’ve only slept 3 hours and feel fine (as I do often) just go with it, and give up on the notion of getting 8 hours of sleep at a time"
TalkTherapy,fdnoyoy,t3_em883p,1578590183.0,"I had a similar situation, but it kind of manifested in a different way. I got, and still do get, very defensive and kind of combative. At one point, this was some years ago, he had me lie down on his couch and face away from him, like psychoanalysis. I also shared writing, but it was a piece of writing I was working on and was written mainly in metaphors and was not a direct form of communication."
PanicAttack,fdmzt5x,t1_fdlrfpk,1578572765.0,"It’s not something that happens frequently for sure, but it’s dramatic enough to worry about it happening. It seems unfortunate to me that I seem to have vasovagal syncope and also panic attacks also, I think one compounds the other."
CPTSD,fdlvrpc,t3_elvp3k,1578533665.0,"I never had a book, but I researched different methods and definitely settled on a few I thought would be most effective. I think it made/makes me feel better to have an emergency escape plan."
PanicAttack,fdlnjcy,t1_fdllvqr,1578528061.0,"That is very interesting!! I have seen a cardiologist, at some point, and worn a halter monitor. They told me I had mitro valve prolapse, a leaky heart valve. It feels like a skipped beat, but is actually an extra beat in the heart. I don’t typically notice it much, but sometimes do notice it happening more when I’m stressed out. The vasovagal syncope, or fainting spells, happen under high stress. My legs have literally given out from under me before, which was very strange, and fell dramatically to the ground. Since these episodes started happening, which such quick onset, I naturally look and place myself near the exits in any situation. Water does somehow seem to be very important also, not sure why exactly. Instinctually, I do typically lie on the ground immediately and lay my face against something cold. When this happens though, I don’t always pass out. Often, I will sweat profusely and get very pale, most of the time I will vomit also. I hear ringing in my ears and my vision gets very fuzzy, but I typically don’t faint unless I am in a public situation and cannot get away. Is your condition associated with panic attacks? May I ask, do you ever get sick also? Thanks for answering by-the-way!"

The darkness did definitely terrify me as a child and I recall my father threatening to put a lock on the outside of the door, locking me in from the outside, which scared me very much. This was around the same age as you describe. Though he never did put a lock on the door to prevent me from leaving, he definitely threatened me with it.

Anxiety,fdcgfbe,t3_ekltfd,1578274271.0,"I think all you can really be is understanding. I’m the person in my relationship that has severe anxiety, and it can be extremely frustrating for the other person. Try not to be annoyed with her that she’s bothered by things that don’t/wouldn’t bother most people. I feel like I’m constantly explaining myself to my husband, as in, ‘I realize it’s weird not to be able to walk into the grocery store, but can you do it for me?’ Little things like that help, but then again, you don’t want to enable someone to be completely agoraphobic either, that doesn’t help."

I have had a lot of people tell me I look good lately and it’s nice to hear, really, but it’s mostly due to intermittent fasting. I am not very hungry at all for much of the day, and when I do eat, it is in small portions. Physically, I feel pretty good as well, and weigh what I did in high school now...,, mentally, not as good."

I do have a number of friends right now who are very attached to me though, as I seem to play some positive function in their lives. I try to remember that things change though, and it’s not that their feelings towards me are less, but life events have removed each other from our company."
CPTSD,fdavthv,t1_fd9zbly,1578250895.0,"I’m 35 years old now. I was more emotional and brooding when I was younger (more a teenager), and was more willing to share dark thoughts with others. It quite honestly overwhelms people, and it seemed clear to me that they couldn’t help me in that way. I decided to be more outwardly jovial and internally had more of a dark humor and was somewhat nihilistic, in that, I wasn’t really concerned with the outcome of events. There can be a sense of freedom when you feel you have nothing to lose, and in that state, I had many adventures and much fun. I try very hard not to expect anything from anyone or any situation, in that way, I am rarely disappointed. I’m not sure if that answered your question or not."
TalkTherapy,fd9gyzg,t1_fd8f1pm,1578233180.0,"For me, the anxiety never dissipates, it never seems to get any easier with familiarity or time. I was hoping talking to some over the phone would be easier, in that, I get nervous with the idea of someone reading my body language. The idea of therapy in general almost seems too intrusive to me, even though I inherently know that’s what you’re there for. This therapist seems nice enough over the phone, somewhat monosyllabic through text, however, but not incompetent. It appears he has a set of techniques he uses for people with anxiety, that typically work for most people. I think you have to trust enough to believe these techniques can help you. It seems most people enter into therapy in a whole hearted manner, more open, more accepting; I seem to be more cynical and mistrustful. I think he’s already picked up on the part of my personality that ‘doesn’t go with the program,’ and mentioned to me about being more open. It just feels like an impossible situation.....like some people (i.e. me) just can’t be helped. Thanks for letting me vent my frustrations!"
CPTSD,fd6uezz,t3_ejsdnv,1578195845.0,"My panic attacks don’t look like what most people assume panic attacks look like. They basically consist of me laying on the floor, sweating, writhing around then typically vomiting or passing out."
PanicAttack,fd6b7b7,t1_fd4lnp6,1578188311.0,"I do realize it’s a lot to ask of a person, to deal with idiosyncrasies they can’t quite understand in another person. I also seem to possess more than most. I can understand his impatience quite honestly, I’m not sure of the trade off is balanced in his favor. I think I’ve hammered home my point of, ‘I can’t help it,’ enough now that he seems to be somewhat more understanding at this point."
TalkTherapy,fd461fo,t1_fd3xuvi,1578164725.0,"You can pay, and I did initially pay for, a video session and then ended up backing out. The idea of speaking to someone face to face makes my anxiety quite a bit worse, though, to be fair, I’ve also found it very uncomfortable talking over the phone. I ended up contacting him again some months later when certain symptoms started worsening. I realize a lot of visual cues are probably missed speaking over the phone though. I definitely agree that speaking with someone two times is definitely not enough time to build a rapport. I’m regretting having made the decision to contact this person, as it feels a bit pointless/hopeless. I was in therapy (some 10 years ago), for a number of years, and never did end up trusting him or speaking with him openly. It makes me think how improbable it would be to make a connection with someone so far away and over the phone, almost laughable, in a way. The level of discomfort in speaking with someone, for that purpose, in very intense for me. So intense, in fact, that copious amounts of Xanax are needed to maintain my physical symptoms of anxiety. Sorry for the long reply....just kinda happened!"

CPTSD,fd2237z,t1_fd1wev3,1578140468.0,"I get that too....I’m fairly messed up emotionally too, from things that happened long ago. I’ve just tried to separate friendships from some of my stronger feelings. Sometimes, I back up my friend’s strong emotions about certain subjects, in turn, I let out small snippets of my own life. I have various types of friends, some I would never come to with a problem or a weakness, fun friends, and I have friends who I can cry in their arms. That latter function though isn’t something I employ, as I feel it’s overwhelming for the other person. I find that most of my ‘good’ friends seem to inherently know me and if something is wrong with me, they check up on me in subtle ways.  I have learned, unfortunately, that they cannot really fix what’s wrong with me in any way, just cheer me up, so that is what I try to do for them also."
CPTSD,fd20mlf,t1_fd104zq,1578139793.0,"I still have intense relationships with other people at times. I try to focus mostly on other people’s’ problems, not my own. I’m fairly tight lipped with my own feelings and I let others know how I feel in small doses and only when I know them well."
CPTSD,fd0f00u,t1_fd0dgh2,1578117865.0,"It really depends on the group of people too. I try to be as unmoved as possible as to whether someone responds to me or not. I let people come to me for the most part, and they seem to, here and there, for reasons I don’t quite understand. Perhaps it’s because I don’t take things too seriously or personally. I take every new experience as it comes, never expecting it to be replicated. I also try to realize, MOST other people are selfish and care about you only in relation to them.  You can have a lot of fun with such people but cannot get too emotionally attacked, as they are too changeable."
CPTSD,fd0cxj2,t3_ejebwb,1578117048.0,"At times where I’m really stressed, I will start to shake a shiver uncontrollably, like full body spasms .

CPTSD,fd0avy4,t3_ejk2pv,1578116213.0,"I have similar feelings quite often; I constantly think it wasn’t that bad, and I’m blaming my problems on events from the past. It’s a constant reliving of the events that played out. I also had a violent and unpredictable father, though the cops were never called to my house. I try to think of what I would think acceptable for my 6-year-old daughter to witness, at her age, and then compare it to the things I saw.... kinda helps but it in some perspective for me."
CPTSD,fd08khn,t3_ejr0kt,1578115242.0,"As I got older, my attitude of adventure and my total acceptance of people, along with my ability to not dwell on my problems (if I can’t be in a decent mood, I don’t go out). I have become changeable, adaptable and less serious, in the process, I feel like I’m generally more affable to be around. When I was younger, I was more brooding, and less likely to hide my personal pain from my friends, it caused more intense relationships, now I don’t take things too seriously."

Oddly, I don’t even want him, or anyone else for that matter, around me during that time. I deal with it by myself and have only ever asked to be left alone or for water. Typically, if I have a panic attack at night, I don’t wake anyone and clean up my own mess. I suppose that’s why I was particularly pissed off, he acted like I was putting on a show for drama or something, purposefully keeping him from his intended goal. Thanks for the kind words."

I was taking 300 mg of Luvox for probably 10 years or so. I was able to sleep ‘better’ during that time, but was always very tired in the mornings. Since stopping that medication, I’ve actually lost about 30 lbs, and I wasn’t overweight to begin with. It’s been such a drastic physical change, coupled with the fact that the SSRI did not get rid of my anxiety, made me feel it was not worth it to try it again.

I was not aware that speaking about weight loss triggered people with eating disorders...didn’t mean to do that.

insomnia,fciep2m,t1_fcibv25,1577661421.0,"My insomnia has mostly to do with my anxiety too, I believe. My husband gets a sleeping pill called Temazapan, it’s a benzodiazepine. It helps me sleep for a few hours. I also feel awake 24/7 and can’t tell if I slept or not."
insomnia,fci9g8x,t1_fci8n5g,1577659370.0,"About 8 months or so. I’ve had insomnia since I can recall, but would always take naps during the day. Now, I’m seemingly never tired and wake up most days between 3-5 am, no matter how little I’ve slept."
insomnia,fci7io0,t3_ehc6m5,1577658669.0,"I have a similar problem right now....never sleepy, always feel wide awake."
TalkTherapy,fchkgts,t1_fchebtg,1577651276.0,"I’ve honestly never considered ADHD before. I have English Literature/History degrees and during a majority of that time, I could and did read many books of great length. At some point though, during the latter years of studying, I found my attention could not stay on what I was reading. I managed through but would often read pages without any comprehension of what I was reading. I would kind of drift off into space for some minutes without recollection. Also, my ‘functional’ is relatively easy to maintain, as I am lucky enough not to have to work outside my home."
offmychest,fchhaa8,t1_fchfl2z,1577650460.0,"That’s true, thanks. Her situation has somewhat overwhelmed me at times, and I feel at a loss."
offmychest,fch5kw8,t1_fch2aks,1577647477.0,"She hasn’t had much in her life either, in the way of luck. She’s always telling me what a wonderful friend I am to her, but I feel I could do more."
insomnia,fch4kw1,t1_fch2byy,1577647256.0,"I agree about the napping, but strangely never nap anymore. Once I’m up, I’m up for the day lately, whether that’s 3 am or 6am. It doesn’t seem to matter if I’ve only slept 2 or 2 hours, I’m wide awake. I did actually stop taking a rather large dose of an antidepressant proceeding this particularly bad bought of insomnia though."
CPTSD,fcezwyo,t3_eh4pzk,1577625248.0,Exactly! I also don’t ask people too many questions! People seem to enjoy coming to me with their problems precisely because I don’t judge.
Anxiety,fceu449,t1_fcchhw3,1577623802.0,"I’ve actually been midway through chewing a piece of food and been like, ‘no thank you,’ and spit it into the garbage. During highly anxiety producing times, the size of my stomach seems to shrink and very little food seems to fill me up, any more leaves me nauseous. I’ve never had an eating disorder so-to-speak, but anxiety has caused me to lose about 30 lbs in the past 8 months or so."
Anxiety,fcbz47a,t3_egzss8,1577592579.0,"Yes, when my anxiety gets bad, my stomach clenches up and eating makes me want to vomit. The taste of food is not really pleasing either, the food kind of dies in my mouth."
TalkTherapy,fcbiy8f,t1_fcapwfu,1577587419.0,"Thanks for the information. I’m not particularly interested in taking the test again, as I have come to believe that they do not factor in many different aspects of intelligence. I was very bothered by knowing my IQ was roughly 120 at the time, because knowing kind of ‘burst my bubble,’ so-to-speak, and I really never wanted to know in the first place. It really was pressured upon me, and if I recall, took weeks to score. As another person mentioned, it was to satisfy his own curiosity, and had no benefit to me."
mentalhealth,fcac2bo,t3_egttb5,1577566500.0,"Yes, but for the most part, I avoid large crowds. In a few rare instances I actually have collapsed and fainted."
CPTSD,fc6x4hd,t1_fc6twax,1577491754.0,"I’m not very good at using drugs either! That’s probably why I only get 10 Xanax at a time now. Good luck to you too, insomnia is horrible."
