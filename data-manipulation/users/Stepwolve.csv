And its probably a sound business strategy.   Reddit vastly overestimates how important and profitable the 'creator' side of youtube is.   If youtube could make more money by supporting 'creators' - they would be doing it instead.

yeah i agree with you there.   There has been a lot of setup there, for dabi to never get his confrontation.    And IMO dabi will end up klling endeavor.    That would set up the dabi v shoto rivalry, force shoto to deal with the loss of his abusive father, and leave his family without proper 'closure' from him. It would be an interesting route to take for shoto's character development.          
  
   Although there is a potential combination - what if ojiko's backup plan is Dabi?    Either dabi already being nearby, or warping dabi there with the little nomu.    He does seem to have a special preference for Dabi - always complimenting him and letting him test the high end.   Maybe thats because dabi is his safety net too"

Which says that Rob told his fiance he found the brother 'extremely attractive', and that it was because they looked similar.   Unless your argument is that OP or the sister made up all of that, it seems pretty clear that Rob told the sister that.   We dont know what was said in their conversation, but we do know that he told the sister the brother was hot, that it was partially due to them looking similar, and that he was questioning his sexuality as a result."

He clearly has some stuff to work through if he cant even avoid hitting on his brother-in-law enough that the entire family notices.    
  
Maybe hes straight and just a little bi-curious, but it seems apparent that he wants to explore those feelings.     And you cant do that while engaged in a hetero relationship (unless your partner is cool with it, which the sister clearly is not).

That seems intentional, not accidental.    And then he keep messaging the brother afterwards.   There were so many options where he could have disengaged - and chose not to.    And it all blew up in a rather predictible manner.    
  
In a perspective, his actions have managed to isolate her from her (supportive) family. Removed a financial safety net for her, and ensured that he is the only person she can talk to.   Even heading home will be scary for her now out of fear the whole town knows about her brother and fiance.

anime,ffx0gzw,t1_ffwuaez,1580315101.0,that arc was insane.    Paying off all the mystery that came before it.   Cant believe the show has basically caught up with the manga now
MonsterHunterWorld,ffsxte9,t3_ev0pm2,1580196971.0,"My personal experience - i used the guardian armor to power through the vanilla campaign.   Now im pretty deep into iceborne and have long since upgraded to better gear.    
  
I didnt develop any bad habits, it didnt make it harder to get into iceborne, it was actually really nice.    I first tried to get into MHW when it first released on PC, but found the learning curve too steep (and it was buggy as hell on release).    Then a month back i bought the master edition on ps4 and played it with guardian armor.     
  
It was much easier to get into with the guardian armor.    You can spend the early monters just trying out different weapons without much risk of dying.    Then you gradually need to learn to craft consumables and eventually gear.    Its does drag a little in the middle, but you can solely focus on campaign missions and move through the story quickly.     And into iceborne which has been amazingly fun.     
  
if you've got lots of time and want to experience everything - then you should probably ignore it.   But if you want to get to the newer, more interesting content, or get to the endgame a bit sooner (it will still be a LONG trip to iceborne) - then play with the guardian armor! The nice thing is you can take it off whenever you want if you feel like the extra challenge.  The defender weapons also speed up all the boring early fights *considerably*, and get you to the more interesting fights faster.   Most people responding probably played through the vanilla campaign when it first released, and then iceborne months later - but playing them back to back is very long already, and the guardian gear shortens that to a more balanced length"

movies,ffr1bdy,t3_eucqgp,1580148282.0,"the biggest risk of this tech is if someone figures out how to reverse-engineer it.   Similar to how people found a way to reverse face-blurring tech to re-show the faces.   
  
But in theory this should be much better, because it is overlaying their faces rather than just distorting them on a set pattern.   But i am not an expert in video evidence, so who knows how safe it is long-term.    In any case - very cool technology! And we are one step closer to never being able to trust video evidence"
movies,ffqvnxo,t1_ffpw11z,1580144685.0,"it could just be that the default settings on your tv bring out those colors more than the movie theater is.     Another option is on the bigger screen in highest quality - you may not have noticed the color palette as much.    Sometimes seeing things on a smaller screen make those production choices much more apparent.  
  
I notice it a lot with CGI - in theaters it looked good, but on a small screen it looked much jankier"

television,ffpioek,t1_ffnttrr,1580095972.0,"its kind of a last ditch justification.    Avatar was a kids show so good that adults loved it too.   But HDM is a kids show that often... feels like a kids show.     
  
Its ultimately a criticism of the show, saying that it doesnt appeal to both kids and adults the way people expected it to.   Kids will probably still love it, but its not that great watching as an adult..."
television,ffpif8x,t1_ffnbfmv,1580095797.0,"i cant find the right words for what bothered me with the show.   All the elements were good - good story, good sets, good actors, good effects.    But it was less than the sum of its parts.    
  
The story felt pointless and meandering most of the time.   The characters feel *dry* like you said, as though there is no deeper emotions to them.    Everyone just says what the feel and theres nothing beneath.    
  
It was honestly a weird experience.   I liked all the elements of the show, and i could barely finish it.    hopefully season 2 brings a lot more to it"

HunterXHunter,ffhlw8j,t1_ffcsb3l,1579941490.0,"its a story the was kind of doomed the second they escaped the first farm.   The first arc was so amazing because it was kids scheming and planning to escape, while also learning about their real world. it was basically like a heist movie story with all of that intrigue and mystery.   
  
But then they escaped...  
  
And at that point it became some sort of survival story in a demon world.   It became a completely different story than what it started with.    I feel the same way about Westworld: the first season was a completely different kind of story than the second season - and its entirely because the characters were *successful* in the first season.   But their success demanded a change in genre and tone for the story afterwards"
television,ffhl6y2,t1_fffpjgl,1579940473.0,">The second credit cards & banks start offering auto-unsubscribe functions for unused services, the entire TV economy is going to collapse  
  
that would require banks to have access to your viewing habits on streaming platforms.   Which would be a massive privacy reach for the banks - they would have viewing data on every streaming company on earth, and could sell that data.    No way that people and streaming companies would go for that deal. And it would be worse for banks too, because people would spend less on their credit cards"
AskReddit,ffhl03z,t1_ffhgyaw,1579940197.0,seems reasonable
AskReddit,ffhkvp7,t1_ffhg3lf,1579940022.0,"there was actually something similar that happened in history.    One of the old methods of 'testing guilt' was to have a priest 'let god decide'.  Essentially they would have 2 people, and the priest would tell them they were each to dunk their hand in boiling water.   If they were innocent - god would protect them from being burned. But if they were guilty - they would get boiled.        
  
The results of that premise would often reveal the guilty party.  
  
People were so devoutly religious, that they 100% believed god would choose the winner.   The results were often as follows:  
  
1. the guilty party would refuse the test out of fear.   Either drop their accusation or plead guilty to the priest. While the innocent person would trust god to protect them.      
2. the priest would judge the stories of the 2 parties, and 'judge' who was right by giving the innocent party hot water instead of boiling water - so they wouldnt be burned.  Or the priest would talk for a long time before they tested so by the time he dunked his hand - the water wasnt boiling any longer. The priest would act as a judge after hearing their stories in the trial, and maybe witnesses too.        
3. the two parties would make an agreement to settle the case rather than risk being burned (usually both were somewhat at fault), and it would no longer be a case for the church.     
  
But the people's faith basically created a trial system out of fear of divine retribution.    I believe the sources were either Discipline and Punishment, or one of the freakonomics books"

I wish it did because there are so many episodes and it is so highly praised - maybe ill give it another shot soon. is the first season a good example of what its like for the later seasons?"
television,fffoqbt,t3_etdaoc,1579888505.0,"personally, i think its a great strategy for widening their market.    Ive watched all of both infinity train and steven universe, and I dont think i've watched any other cartoon network shows in a decade.   Bringing in a larger, over-arching plot draws viewers into the show, in a manner that an episodic show never can.    As well, they make for much more valuable streaming shows in the long term.   
  
And for younger viewers - I think its nice that these shows respect their audience's intellegence.   They dont try to hand-hold kids to understand every little bit - they just a tell a story, and kids can read or watch more to understand the details and lore.   It encourages more engagement from the audience, and as everyone moves to streaming platforms - they are very bingeable.   
  
But this is also a larger trend than just cartoon network.    The Dragon Prince, Avatar TLA, and Gravity falls are all 'kids shows' that have garnered huge adult audiences by having entertaining and compelling narratives.    IMO much of it is inspired by the success of anime - which for decades has told long serialized stories and marketed them to all ages.    Avatar TLA was openly inspired by anime, and set the standard for serialized, animated kid-friendly stories in the west."
