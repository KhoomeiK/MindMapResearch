Two men who both respected and despised one another, trying one last time to come to a platonic understanding of the other. It brought me to tears."
AskMen,ffgv5e2,t1_fffggpe,1579915856.0,"Funnily enough I'm rewatching the show right now. I'm on the latter half of season four and it's a real slog. I think it's weaker than the originals because the family doesn't really interact with each other for most of it, and the recut version just *spam*s the recaps. Easily five minutes per episode, minimum, is spent telling you what happened last episode."

AskMen,ff6lb41,t1_ff4xh8b,1579629629.0,"Honestly, I'm impressed/surprised you didn't bail before the sex. Was she crazy hot, or were you just going through a dry spell?"
