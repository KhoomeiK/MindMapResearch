WitcherTRPG,ffnossx,t1_ffnnvd0,1580068692.0,No worries. I can’t help but I would have been interested by a session on discord with an expert to ask few questions.
LeeSinMains,ffnoolj,t1_ffnnlq9,1580068643.0,"1. 
Tbf ekko jungle is a pain in the ****. It ways too overpowered and frustrating to okay against him. 

You beat him in one v one early if you can dodge the stun with a dash ward and if you engage the fight. Keep the Q for the end of the duel. 
After level 6 I wouldn’t try to fight him. Exchange some blows but you won’t kill him if he has his ult.

2.
Regarding electrocute: don’t take it. If you want something else than conqueror go DH but I wouldn’t recommend it.

If you snowball hard you can take a more damage oriented build. 
Right now I take in general : 

rush red item jungle > boots. Case 1: I have a lead so I take the lethality item that clean ward then BC > sterak/GA. Case 2: I am even or behind then I go BC >  sterak then GA."
whowouldwin,ffnmxr3,t3_eu6xaf,1580068054.0,"Wrong matchup. Odin should mop the floor with him.

Odin has numerous hax and is just leagues above végéta."
LeeSinMains,ffnmlxn,t3_eu8nwk,1580067915.0,"To be fair seeing the state of the jungle, I generally do red /.blue gromp > transition for gank or invade or blue / gromp / red > transition for gank or invade.

Be ready at 3:15 for the scuttle. You should be full life after your clear thanks to your passive (2 aa after each skills) and your W.

If I have a great opportunity to gank lvl 2, I will (after an invade for instance or if I have a nauti bot)

Most of the jungle get destroyed by lee if you invade, so abuse that and focus on stealing the gromp & buffs if you can. 

Your begin to fall off around lvl 13. You have to make this 12 level count by securing the drake & the herald. 

You can solo drake and herald with just the jungle item.
Try giving the priority to your laner before trying to secure those objective. 

Do you need other advice? What that what you were expecting?"
WitcherTRPG,ffnk4cz,t3_eu8ya3,1580067027.0,You want a GM to do an online campaign?
whowouldwin,ffmpakt,t1_ffmp65n,1580057479.0,That’s my point. Humans nowadays run for the sake of running. Which isn’t the case for wolves.
whowouldwin,ffmjoti,t1_fflbymo,1580055617.0,"I agree with everything said tho I wonder if the wolf has the willingness to do it and was well fed, wouldn’t he be able to run for longer than humans."

whowouldwin,ffeokac,t1_ffeo6zu,1579857517.0,"Really depends hon how it happens. 
Mountain lion is quite small compared to all the cats in this battle.
A bloodlusted Wolf is stronger than any dogs. Depends on the wolf, wolf from northern countries can be huge. I don’t see a spartan winning against one. Especially when you know how strong they can bite."

McGregor is training in HtH combat. Not in sword fight.   
Lebron james isn't from what I know.   


Wookies are considerably stronger & more resistant than humans. I don't see him losing in R1.   
He would probably lose in R2. 4/10"
LeeSinMains,feg79q3,t1_feg63ji,1579080343.0,"I don't feel speed is the issue. 
Lot of people react (at my elo it might no be representative and be different above plat) when they see the flash. 
Dash warding allows to burn their flash without commiting yours. If they don't flash you dash ward, they can't react to the kick-flash.

Maybe I don’t feel confident so I don’t using as much as I should. But, in game, it is really rare to be in a situation where I need it. Most of the time a classic Q dash ward R flash Q is enough"

Fantasy,fdqzmzn,t3_empcxp,1578677472.0,"When you display a monarchy: the focus of your story is on one person. When you display a democracy: the centre of your story is a bunch of people.      
Having a sole person to focus is easier to read and allow the author to be precise about their feelings, backstories, etc.    It isn't doable for a big group of people because the book & story would be way too long and hard to follow.     
In my opinion, this is why a lot of authors is using monarchy in fantasy. It is generally appealing, and it almost always makes you appreciate that person more because you share its view on the good and the negative.     
It's not about selling monarchy. It's about displaying the struggle of a person who has enormous responsibilities. It generally makes for a better story than following a group of 10/20 people from a government.    
By the way, a lot of people would have a different view of their president if they were friendly with him/her."

whowouldwin,fdn3nbv,t1_fdlmkcv,1578576329.0,"Yeah. For me it is like comparing gun and sword ahah. Both are so different than any confrontation between the two is one sided depending of the set up. 

Maybe: put them both unequipped, with training blade recreating the weight and length of their weapon of choice in a touch based match could be even fairer? 
I would then give it to the Jedi just because of the force precognition but some knights might take a win."
whowouldwin,fdlkphy,t3_eltxni,1578526203.0,"A medieval knight wearing an armor, sword and shield resistant to the force and lightsabers VS a Jedi would a fair fight I guess. 

The Jedi would have to find the weaknesses in the armor and strike precisely while still having an agility advantage. 

The knight would be slower but much more protected. I would give it to the knight tho."
