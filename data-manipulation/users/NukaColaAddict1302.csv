I've been told by doctors time and time again that scarring from an accident I went through may itch, especially in the first few months of the healing process. The few bad scars I have still itch from time to time, save the spot that suffered nerve damage. You mean to tell me each and every doctor has been wrong?"

Correction, they're an easier mistake to make. All the more reason why you shouldn't have missed it. 


I never claimed to be smarter nor was I attempting to use proper grammar. I was pointing out your apparent double standard when it comes to your own grammar. Maybe make sure you've got it all nailed down before criticizing someone else next time."
