Every once and a while I find a task relaxing if I’m doing it in my free time, for myself. But once people figure out how good I am at cleaning a toilet, washing dishes, vacuuming, etc it’s a nightmare. Everyone beings to *expect* my things to be clean and well organized all the time but that’s just exhausting. And at work? Forget about it, the level of my boss’s expectation shoots through the roof once people find out I’m good at cleaning/organizing."

unpopularopinion,fev9yhh,t3_eqh2c2,1579394921.0,"I started talking suicide in 2-3rd grade. Now I’m a teacher and I see mental health issues in my students all the time. Kids are humans with emotions just as complex as adults they just don’t know how to process, deal with, or explain how they’re feeling. 

It’s getting better as far as awareness is concerned. Emotional regulation is a difficult and trying thing to teach a kid so most parents/teacher/etc struggle with it. It’s the reason why we (my particular cohort) all grew up with poor coping skills and have to learn them later in life."

Kinda pulling at the bra, maybe looking really close at the mirror, fixing hair, whatever it may be. Embarrassing for her that you saw it? Maybe. A creepy/violation? Not at all.

bestof,fehlcgc,t1_fehetlk,1579118878.0,I think the writers over at BoJack Horseman got it right when they wrote “when you’re seeing someone through rose colored glasses all the red flags just look like flags.” That line has always stuck with me.
