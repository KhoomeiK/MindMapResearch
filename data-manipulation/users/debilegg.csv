agnostic,fepsez0,t1_feplzcq,1579329679.0,"I think about that a lot. Prophetic literature is intentionally vague and written as admonishment for their intended audience of the day. Their intended audience was the people who existed in that time and place; not some future person or people group. Their author also could have or could have not written the book bearing their name. There's speculation on many OT prophetic books that they may have been written after the fact and bore the author's name as a title because they were a well known prophet to begin with. Christians will, 100% of the time, immediately throw out this possibility in their search for truth, and then cherry pick verses that ""speak to them."" It's bad, extremely subjective hermeneutics, but they all do it. 

I graduated from a Christian University years ago and learned the ""right"" way to study the Bible, but under the assumption that it is the inerrant word of God written through so many authors over so many years in so many lands. This preconceived notion really defends one's faith from any doubt until any actual thought I'd applied to the hermeneutical spiral, at which point it all falls apart and the very thing that I studied to reinforce my faith and others tarnished itself."
