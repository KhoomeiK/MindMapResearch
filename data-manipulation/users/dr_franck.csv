When she does post about her training, she refuses to put any meaningful metrics like time, distance or speed, so her training documentation is a whole bunch of nothing where she just whines and complains. Hell, she posts selfies that accompany her posts, and those photos were found to have been taken on the same day but spread out across multiple posts / days. She’s also completed in 2 marathons that we know of, and both race-times have been longer than 10 hours.

Take note, as she trains for an IronMan, she has no steady full-time, or even part-time job. She does very occasionally (once every 2 months or less?) get chosen as a speaker for a small crowd for FA related topics, and that’s it."

Also notable is that this is the first time in a long while that Todd's pick for #1 isn't part of some bigger statement. In 2016, Closer was picked because it was about wanting to feel young again. In 2017, Green Light was picked because of pop-timism amidst these bleak times. And 2018's pick was breathin because it was directly about struggling with anxiety.

While I can't say anything for sure, if it will relieve your fears a bit (I can't say any of this with complete authority, as I'm not a doctor or medical professional, but I have done a little research), it's actually very rare to get HIV through oral sex alone. And if you did get HIV through sexual contact, you have an 80% chance of showing symptoms like you described. If you were to show symptoms, it's likely within a 6-month period after the sexual contact. So if you haven't had anal sex in the past 6 months before you started getting cough / mouth sores /etc. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
