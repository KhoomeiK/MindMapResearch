All those big capital names are defines so the big capital is good practice - at least far better then them overwriting near and far to mean nothing and messing with min and max. Two of them are for types and use Hungarian notation, so LRESULT and HWND actually encode what they contain - a long integer (32bit instead of 16) as return type and a handle to a WND (a window) . \_In\_ is a compiler specific name in C - note the leading _ followed by a capital letter and denotes an input argument for whatever tooling / linter Microsoft has. That leaves CALLBACK which simply denotes the function as a callback function and sets the calling convention without anyone having to worry about getting it right.

worldnews,fend2og,t1_fen7rwy,1579282097.0,"The problem is that you can keep an inefficient system going as long as you use your other system to support it. It basically bypasses a competitive market as other companies operating in that segment may not have alternate means to support themselves. The result doesn't have to be better, more competitive or efficient in any sense as long as it outlasted the competition. 


An example is IE from Microsoft, a ""free""^1 browser supported by the most widespread OS that killed of all competing browsers and crippled web development for years as it barely received updates itself once it achieved market dominance. Google is currently in the process of taking advantage of its current market dominance in order to kill ad blockers, newer Chrome plugin APIs intentionally limit how ads can be blocked and Googles own services appear more and more broken on browsers that do not share chromes back end^2 . 

A second example was Microsoft Word early on. When Microsoft planed new APIs for Windows it involved the authors of several competing word processors. When Microsoft released the new Windows version it did so with several breaking changes to those APIs, only Word ran from day one. So if you ever wondered how Word became so widely used, it is not because it was even remotely good, Microsoft just made sure that it was the only working option. 

Going away from Microsoft we have Intel and its Intel compiler. The Intel compiler is to this day one of the best in the industry, you want fast software? You use it. Intel is also known for its great CPUs and we have lots of benchmarks to prove it. Of course those benchmarks were intended to run as fast as possible, so they used the Intel Compiler and for years Intel won with barely a question. Only AMD added more features to its CPUs, features that should have shown a large increase in performance and the benchmarks stayed the same, what was going on? Turns out the Intel Compiler inserts a CPU vendor check into every binary it compiles, causing the execution of fallback code for every non Intel CPU, fallback code intended for CPUs that lacked any feature added in the last 10 years. This trick wasn't documented until a lawsuit forced them to come clean. 

^1 Microsoft pulled a fast one on the original developers behind IEs web engine with that, at a time when browsers cost money they asked for a share of the profit. They settled for a few million. 

^2 Youtube for example was written against Googles own Shadow DOM proposal, implemented by Chrome. Any browser implementing the official standard version of the API has Youtube running in a slow fallback mode."

Some of that resolved itself by the technology itself becoming less diverse. Game trying to use your 56 k modem instead of the network card? No longer exists.

Your games want a serial crossover cable for network play (I think C&C Red Alert)? Same, IP it is. Can't get your machines onto the same Workgroup to share files?
