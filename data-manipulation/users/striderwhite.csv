movies,fd2e2iy,t3_ejkskh,1578145881.0,">  It started with Life of Pi and everyone being *so impressed* with the tiger. At the time, I thought everyone was insane. That tiger always looked fake, but a lot of people didn't feel the same way

It looked a bit fake, but it wasn't that bad, at least to me. In that case it worked because the tiger was just a metaphor, like some other parts of the movie. In the end it all looked over realistic but at the same time you were amazed by the (improbable) story of a kid having to survive in the middle of the ocean with a tiger! By the time you discover what really happened you have already forget that the tiger was CGI, most of what we see is CGI. Sure, they could have used a real tiger, real water and so on, but I think that in that case Ang Lee made a good choice. Then we have really bad CGI like that of ""Cats"", 7 years later nonetheless, where they could have used costumes and make a decent movie."
