Google also tells me reptilian shapeshifters are controlling my thoughts and that the Earth is flat, doesn't mean its true now does it? 

Without specifying the actual lift or the methodology of the measurement, it means nothing. Humans can probably lift that much too in highly specific circumstances, yet nobody would seriously suggest a human is stronger than a gorilla or a bear. I know for a fact we at least can do half of that weight. And we're half the size of a gorilla, or at least smaller(strongmen are large). 

[Here is Ronnie Coleman(bodybuilder) leg pressing 2300lbs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vWgSTdkc2A) 

[Here is some strongmen lifting 2700lbs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wDtEyTLIy4)

What does that mean? Not much by itself but arguably more than your imaginary number quoted vaguely from 'Google'... You didn't even give me the source website haha. 

Was it a gorilla squat? A lift where the gorilla grabbed a hold of something for support and then pulled on a cable weight? I mean, what the fuck are we talking about here?"

Fair enough.

Yeah, its very fascinating. Its almost like a pushing power. Like a giant sledgehammer coming at you very slowly. It just doesn't slow down when it hits your body. Like once you got it up to a certain speed, it wouldn't matter. Almost like they physically can't make those heavy arms move fast, so there isn't any real windup needed.

Roy Nelson vs. Overeem saw [Big Country take 2 Cro Cop-like kicks to the head](https://youtu.be/k8WSDwZ8TKs?t=261) without dropping. Listen to the sound of that kick, Jesus. 

He got one more later or earlier than the one you see in that clip. He also got his body molested by Overeem(post-Ubereem, still had a little of that juice in him) and might even have gotten a knee or two to the face in that fight. 

Getting headkicked(or kneed) by either Cro Cop or Overeem has to be up there as some of the hardest 'shots' ever taken in combat sports. I seriously wonder what Hunto and Roy Nelson will sound like in a few years. They must both have horrible cases of CTE, shouldn't be able to speak.

Both interestingly got KO'd the first time by glass canons in the very same year(2008) lol, Arlovski KO'd Big Country and Manhoef(hardest hitter ever in MMA? 28/30KO's) KO'd Mark Hunt in 18 seconds in K-1/DREAM I think.

MMA,fgms8ou,t1_fgmp8pp,1580930999.0,"Disagree, Manhoef has a **much** higher KO percentage(28 out 30 fights KO). 

Eh maybe he was the hardest hitter in the division/weight class *at some point* but he wasn't all *that* hard hitting. A hard hitter for sure but he wasn't spectacular compared to some of the hardest hitting martial artists. 

For example, he had 30 kickboxing wins but *only* 13 KO's. 

13 MMA fights and 10 KO's, which is very good but its not like he KO'd ever single opponent. He failed at KO-ing Cro Cop, Wanderlei Silva, Ben Rothwell and all the guys he lost too(guys not always famous for good chins like Oleneik, Marvin Manhoef, McCorkle, Barnett). 

Also lost two of his boxing matches. 

A hard hitter by MMA standards but his actual hands aren't all that hard hitting compared to martial arts where that's the main focus(kickboxing or boxing). 

Ngannou is looking like a much, much harder hitter than Mark Hunt ever was.

I agree about his Foreman like punches, though they are faster than his. Mark Hunt was arguably fast for his size. I agree that he does generate big power through a similar rotation of his very wide torso as Foreman did."

They had some rules though, like no attacking the windpipe, eyes, bite, inside of the mouth, no kicking with shoes. And if the guy tapped you obviously had to stop or when the ref pulled stopped/pulled you off. 

Other than that you could do whatever to the other guy. No point system as far as I am aware, just KO/TKO or submission, otherwise draw. They might have had decision victories(from points I assume) from IVC 3 or so but earlier none far as I know.

You could have had Conor fight Jorge instead of Snoozemen and your imaginary BMF title would go out with a bang(as in make lots of money) instead of fizzling out against Snoozeman. 

If Conor would have lost against Jorge at 170lbs then you could still save his stock by saying its a division Conor isn't comfortable at and then move him down to 155lbs where all his fans would say he's truly the best. 

Now the BMF title is gonna fizzle out in the hands of Snoozeman, not making anywhere near the amount of money it would if Jorge fought Conor instead. 

Fucking motherfucker -_-"
MMA,fg6drha,t3_ewu7aw,1580564921.0,"Strange, why the fuck wouldn't Dana make him fight Conor? That's a money fight! 

What else should you do with Conor at 170lbs? Is Dana seriously gonna make him wait until Khalabib and Tony are done? 

Whatever money and hype the BMF title had behind now fizzles away. Jorge fighting Conor would have let the BMF title go out with a bang, making more money than any BMF vs. Snoozeman ever could. 



I mean, Conor talks about wanting to fight often so it doesn't make sense to make him wait. 

Worried a loss at 170lbs against Jorge is gonna be make the Conor stock go down? That can be explained away by saying he is in a division he isn't accustomed too. Done, loss now much more understandable and Conor's stocks are mostly still intact. 

I do not get Dana on this one, very fucking weird."

Rainbow6,fg4uo5h,t1_fg4avtw,1580511489.0,"Wrong. 

Some soft iron(or even steel) railing should be penetrated *easily* by faster rifle calibers like 5.56. The M995(5.56 AP) will penetrate about 10mm+ of Rolled homogeneous steel at point blank range. 

The M855/SS109 will penetrate around 8-9mm of normal mild steel within 200 yards and that's an outdated cartridge from the 70s. That's nothing exotic today. 

Russian 9x19mm overpressure AP loads will penetrate 8mm of medium hardness steel(0.30% carbon) at 10 yards or so. ***That's a slow moving pistol caliber.***

Bullets penetrate a lot better than you think. 

Instead of having to simulate the complex ballistics of steel penetration, Ubi can just lower the damage bullets do when passing through certain metallic assets in the game."
