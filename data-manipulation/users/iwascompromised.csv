Russia is not considered a hostile nation in any way that is legally and constitutionally required for treason. Virtually no one has been convicted of treason because of how high the bar is for it, rightly so. In fact, am charging Trump with treason could be seen by Russia and a US declaration of war because it requires Congress to recognize a country as a hostile nation. Even in the Cold War the USSR and the US were not actually engaged in a war. Even then, what Trump is doing would not have qualified as treason.
