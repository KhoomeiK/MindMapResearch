motorcycles,ffsyury,t3_euszz1,1580198308.0,"As a new rider rev matching on downshifts is entirely unnecessary.  It's something fun to do, and it feels awesome when you get good at it, but it's completely, totally, and utterly unnecessary.

You shouldn't even try as a new rider simply because you've already got so much important stuff you actually need to learn and get comfortable with - trying to do something useless but flashy is just needless distraction.

Hell, I've been riding for 25+ years.  I can rev match just fine while downshifting, but I only do when I want to feel cool coming up to a stop, or if I'm coming into a corner where I want to be in a lower gear for exit torque but without slowing down, and that's only in *very* spirited riding as even in aggressive street riding that's just not very needed (at least given a reasonably powerful bike).

Finally, never bother doing it into first.  In fact, as a rule of thumb just stay out of first unless you stop completely.  I'm sure there's some wildly underpowered bike out there where maybe you'd want to downshift into first while still moving, but I've never ridden one that needed it - not even my old anemic 82 kz440ltd.

FZ07,ffonrpa,t1_ffmdby8,1580079670.0,"As much as I decidedly loved my 2018 MT07, *in retrospect* I kinda wished I just got the MT09.  I ended up trading my 07 in for a 2019 Tracer 900 GT, and that's decidedly ""more power than I can practically use"" whereas I used 100% of the MT07 every single day.  WOT from every stop.  

I really enjoyed the MT07 - I was at no point ever unhappy with it - but I did hit it's limits.  I invested a lot of money in aftermarket exhaust/airbox/tuning, which DID net noticeable gains, but on retrospect I ended up paying way more than if I'd just bought an MT09 stock, and even fully tuned and kitted the 07 has nothing whatsoever on an 09 performance wise. 

Given the price difference is so negligible, if someone isn't a new rider I strongly recommend the 09 instead if they're the sort to want to zoom a lot.  

It's funny, though, if you've just ridden the 07 and slower bikes, the 07 feels *fucking fast* (and to be sure, it is decidedly NOT a slow bike).  But once you've ridden a CP3 bike around for a while at roughly twice the power, it's kind of hard to go back.  I didn't get that from test rides before I bought my 07, though - you don't really push them hard on test rides, after all.  But once you push the 07 to its limits regularly, then push the 09 to it's limits... there's a real, real big gap."
FZ07,ffomtp3,t3_eu33xk,1580079302.0,"If you want a straight upgrade keeping much the same, go with an MT09.  The MT09 is a violent monster of a naked, a veritable unicycle in A mode.  

Personally, I moved on to an MTT09GT (Tracer 900 GT) from mine, which is a mixed bag as the Tracer is quite a different machine.  The MT07 is an extremely raw fun machine, whereas while the Tracer is monstrously faster (something shared by the MT09) the longer swingarm, higher seat, larger tank, riding modes, traction control, etc all make a much more refined ride.  

The Tracer would leave the 07 in the dust, but it doesn't *feel* as fast, even though it accelerates substantially faster and has a much higher top speed in practice.  But the 07 *felt* faster, simply because of how you'd ride it WOT all the time engine screaming vs just being gentle on the throttle on a bigger machine.  I mean, if I go WOT on my Tracer, even with the extended swingarm I'd be pulling dank whoolies without the TCS on, and I'd be sailing past 200kph in seconds.  0-100kph/60mph is like 3.2 seconds.  So, you rarely experience that same level of frenzied high RPM's, and definitely not for as long.

That'll happen on the MT09 to an extent as well, but the MT09 lacks the physical dimensions to make it feel slower - the MT09 is basically the same size as the MT07, after all.  The MT09 is a crazy rush to ride."

Why aren't there more cruiser guys *here in r/motorcycles* - it's not very welcoming to particularly the HD crowd here, and cruiser demographics have little overlap with average Reddit demographics.

But for the actual question, why aren't there more cruisers on the road:

For most of motorcycling history, cruisers where the alternative to sport bikes, with dual sports being a bit of an oddball not really applicable to many people unless they want to go offroad.

So if you wanted to do any longer trips, and distance riding, you wanted a cruiser.  Nothing else came close.

In the last decade, that's changed substantially.  Old standard bikes got lumped into cruisers, but these days we have naked bikes which are basically sport bikes with actually comfortable ergos, and we have ADV bikes with comfortable ergos and touring packages.  

Now, the only reason to get a cruiser is basically because you want the look specifically.  

ADV/sport touring bikes are better for long haul riding, equally (if not more) comfortable, and possess significantly increased performance and handling.  They're significantly cheaper, and tend to feature much better tech at a given price point.

So, cruisers these days are more an aesthetic, and one that's viewed as being more for the older generation."

My wife and I have a car and my bike.  I ride everywhere, and only drive the car if it's *absolutely* necessary, and I hate doing it.  The car just gets me around, it doesn't make me blissfully happy.  It's like a bus, but without annoying Public Transit People.

funny,ffaewji,t1_ffacl9z,1579734082.0,"Yeah, entropy is ultimately why, but is pretty nebulous an explanation and doesn't really mean anything to your average person.

More directly, there are losses everywhere. Compressors, fans, and such - all emit some heat, and that heat is lost input energy.  Because refrigeration devices are just moving heat, all the electricity the consume is energy added to the system.  That consumed electricity is all converted to *extra* heat, in addition to the heat the device moves.

So, a freezer using 200 watts is basically identical to a 200 watt heater. 

A fun way to see how this works in practice is if you have a portable air conditioner - the sort with an exhaust tube you put in a window - disconnect the exhaust tube and just run the AC in a closed room.

Left for a similar job paying quite a bit more, then jumped through a few different jobs fairly quickly, each netting me a couple bucks an hour more than the last.

You're just working at getting a higher wage, and learning more diverse skills you can better leverage for the next job.  The more you get paid, the more valuable you look to a prospective company.

Ironically, over my career ranging from minimum wage through to earning 85k a year (not spectacular, but not terrible either - good enough for someone without an education!) there's been one constant:

The actual effort expected from me by my employers is inversely correlated with how much they're paying me.  

Work in a warehouse, and they'll run you nearly to death in the shittiest of conditions and not give the slightest fuck about how miserable you are, because you're cheap, expendable, and there's 20 other people lining up for your job.  They don't value your skills or anything about you at all; the only reason they keep you in jobs like that is to avoid the hassle of training a new guy.  

Meanwhile, you often get paid so little you need to have multiple jobs (where you DO have to work really fucking hard) just to make ends meet and still be basically poverty level.  But because you're working 60+ hour weeks in two+ jobs, you simply don't have time to get an education to move past it - you're trapped. So you work harder than most corporate types will ever understand, with longer hours and tighter restrictions (there's no ""go out for lunch"" when your a wage-slave; your time is way to carefully monitored) and never get anywhere at all.  It's miserable."

I've learned, here and in other places over the decades I've spent working, if you push too hard, everyone pushes back.  

Managers?  You bust your ass, and managers then dump ever more of *their work* on you.  Now, they'll tell you this makes you look better and will lead to your being promoted, but if you stop and think about it, that's just stupid.  You don't promote the guy who does your work better than you do it, you keep him doing your work forever and take credit for it.  Even if your manager is not that much of an asshole manager, promoting that you means he's not on your team anymore, and this process insures that he'll lose every good employee he gets until he's only got un-promote-able dumbasses left, so he'd be ultimately failing at his job because he's killing his own team.

Coworkers?  They resent that you're raising the bar for expectations.  This is both reasonable and unreasonable.  I've met lots of younger guys who are super keen and work unsustainably hard, and doing this makes that the expectation even though it's ultimately unsustainable.  On the other hand, most people are very content to only work so hard and really don't like being pushed to work harder, so they resent it. 

So, you get managers that either just abuse you or simply refuse to promote you, and co-workers that resent you.  That's what blood sweat and tears shed working hard gets you.  Not ahead.

I worked really hard in my youth, and got nowhere.  Since just being median, and simply changing jobs whenever I found something that would pay better, I've been happier, healthier, and wealthier.

Are you going to need to bring nicer clothes, for example to go to higher end establishments as you travel?  What to pack varies really heavily on how you intend to travel and what you intend to do.

I do 2.5k trips every year, but I tend to just stay in hotels because I'm old and not into camping anymore.  As such, I know I'll have ready access to showers, soap, towels, laundry, etc, and that really cuts down on the stuff I need to bring. 

My experience has been that in your first few trips - however you're going - you'll horrifically overpack.  Generally speaking, you just don't really need much.  

What I will recommend, as at least for me it wasn't obvious: bring a small pair of comfortable shoes for when you're not riding.  Deck shoes or something, because riding boots, no matter how comfortable, just don't feel good after riding for 500+ miles.  

So, for me?  A 2.5k trip over 5 days will warrant toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, a change of pants, 3 t-shirts, a sweater, 5 pairs of socks and 4 pairs of underwear.

If I plan on going out at night to places where I'd like to be a bit nicer looking, add a pair of nicer pants and a shirt.

I *expect* to wash clothes mid trip, but it's happened that I've been unable to reasonably do that.  I never go light on socks because lots of things can result in gross socks (wet days, hot days, etc) and in quite a few cases it can be very advantageous to double up on socks (very cold, wet).  

Select clothes with an eye for layering for temperature management as appropriate.  I tend to go on road trips in early spring and late fall, so inclement weather is always a possibility.  

For other stuff: 

* Tool roll
* Emergency control cable kit (generic on Amazon, $5 and you get two very long cables and fittings to work on any bike, takes up practically zero space)
* Tire patch kit and small bicycle pump (electric pumps are also possible depending on your setup and space) - this and the last because these are the two most common problems that can strand motorcyclists in shitty places, and both are easy to deal with on your own on the side of the road.  Very important if riding solo.
* Small first aid kit.
* Water bottle(s).  Hydration is important, and it's better to have a couple bottles you don't need that need some you don't have.  Also helpful if a rock damages your radiator.
* Duct tape and zip ties.  These have saved my ass so many times in so many ways.  I also bring a small spool of wire as well.
