All of that to say, they tried to UN-disnefy EPCOT from moment one and it flat out didn't work. The ""Disney-fication"" has really been going on since before the park was even built. It certainly ramped up after initial lackluster guests' complaints, then during Eisner's and again Iger's tenure to achieve a few different goals, but number one is to get people into and coming back to the parks time after time and year after year, and its been an unabashed success. And here we are on a WDW board discussing it. There is no ""old EPCOT"" unless you're strictly speaking about Walt's promotional film a few weeks before he died, and that's never been considered by Disney Corp as anything other than fantasy. EPCOT has been a bit of a haphazard work in progress since it was essentially slapped together in the late 70s as whatever they could get a corporation (or foreign country -which they couldn't but not for lack of trying) to sponsor.  At the very least, with the new work, they are on track to create more of a thematic experience than its been over the past 15 or whatever years. If that includes more Disney IP, so be it.

All, including the specific selections I have quoted from the book, are in my humble opinion. For what its worth, I don't disagree with you on the soul-sucking feeling, between the costs and what Disney does and doesn't show to guests, but I'm still a big fan of the parks overall and will continue to bring my family - its still ""worth it"" to us. The addition of IP adds to our enjoyment in many ways, even if it might detract from the original EPCOT Center that tried to marry Walt's vision with a marketable theme park.

\* I add this for a bit of levity as certainly this whiny 16 yr old was probably not indicative of most guests visiting, but it does speak to what they were trying to do at EPCOT and what it was received as by paying guests."

It's a cost-benefit analysis and can be worth simply spending more on liability limits and keeping things in your own personal name. 

Tax reporting is pretty simple either way. LLCs, sole proprietors, even S Corps (as opposed to C Corps) etc are pass through entities, meaning they are not taxed federally, the owners are. So a form K1 (at least for LLCs, if not the others, I only own an LLC and C-Corp) is filed showing income/loss and it goes right on your personal taxes (split appropriately among any multiple owners according to ownership percentage). 

Again, US specific. I own an LLC and planned to start one when I bought my vacation home, but determined the cost wasn't worth the benefit and I just got good insurance that specifically allowed short term renting. Don't skimp on that step, it wasn't easy to find a carrier."

A cord of wood will have roughly 650-750 pieces of 16"" long split logs. Depending how you purchase it (seasoned/kiln dried/green and 1/4 cord, 1/2, full, etc....higher quantities is generally cheaper per cord) you could be approaching $1 per piece (I think I spent $165 on a 1/4 cord seasoned in November, but that was in a bit of a pinch and I'll get a full cord late next summer/early fall) but it really should be closer to $0.50 per piece in my experience. 

I just eat it. The fireplace (or outdoor firepit in the summer) is a big selling point for my space, allowing guests to enjoy it however they wish I think is worth the added cost of wood. I expect the 1/4 cord to last into February and I'll probably grab another 1/4 soon.

Fun fact, the underground tunnels and stuff are super innovative but they were super expensive (what with the high water table in Florida, requiring fill to construct the park quite a few feet above grade so the tunnels weren't flooded pits), so Disney decided the additional building expenses weren't worthwhile for EPCOT and it was changed to an outer ring of service road and facilities, rather than underground."

My travel agent ended up finding a beach club villa deal through the hotel that was pretty good (I was looking at renting points but ultimately missed out on a studio) so that was a nice call, when she said she could save us about a grand to switch to the villas.

Under 3 is free and doesn't need a ticket (if staying on property she will receive a magic band but will pretty much not need it other than to scan at the magical express from the airport). Take advantage of the savings. 

Anyway, you don't really want to do fast passes for her because an adult needs to do the same passes, or you won't be allowed in. You can't book a single pass for your kid and ""follow her into"" the attraction without a pass for yourself. So it's going to preclude you from the good stuff you really want. You can certainly book one parent for those kid centric attractions and try to mix and match your own fast passes between the two days, but I've found it's better to both join your kid and see her light up with joy....if you book the thrill attractions early in the day, you could definitely find a lot of those kid attractions available for your fourth and subsequent fast passes, available once you use the first three. 

You can utilize the rider swap feature on those good rides, but be aware both you and your partner need to have a fastpass, so it's not really anything special for you. One of you will wait while the other rides, then swap. If your child was older and able to ride it, they would allow the child to ride twice, so each parent could experience the ride with their kid. 

I used a Minnie van last year and you reserve it through the Lyft app. I don't know if you can even request car seats through the regular Lyft or uber, but assuming you are bringing your own, I think it would be ok to use them.
