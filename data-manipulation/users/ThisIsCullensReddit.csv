Petioles,fca7aau,t1_fca30uw,1577564118.0,"No, I never “struggled” with addiction. I was in prison for an unrelated crime in my youth and it was a one off experience. I was misled and lied to about what it was and how intoxicated it would get me. You came here to reply to my comment. You are able to exit, just as you came. I’m not going to entertain your mind games. You can be addicted to anything. You’re not going to get physical withdrawal symptoms from a video game addiction, are you? I’m saying of the content of this subreddit is powered by out of date and biased research. I never tried to discredit ops experience; I urged him to look deeper into what might be causing his issues. Why are you so inclined to jump to assumptions?"
Petioles,fca22bh,t1_fca0u7k,1577561867.0,"The fact that you would judge me based on a terrible mistake I made at 18 years old, says a lot about the person you are. I hope you’ll grow up and learn to debate one day, without having to draw a personal attack someone because you ran out of arguments. He without sin shall throw the first stone. Maybe me being in a position that you have experienced and having the wisdom from that experience is the difference between you and me. Have a nice day."
Petioles,fc9z1x2,t1_fc9w81r,1577560343.0,"I don’t know if you can’t read or if you’re just incompetent. Drug addiction has physical symptoms. You must be one of those people that will believe whatever the government tells them. Just because there studies (that are constantly being disproven) that indicate that cannabis has all of these adverse effects, doesn’t mean it’s true. Our government, and science in general, was and still is completely blinded by marijuana prohibition and the war on drugs. There is strong evidence that many studies on cannabis consumption were conducted incorrectly or just straight up fabricated during this ‘war on drugs’. Depression, on the other hand is heavily researched, with valid, unbiased data, and that research, and any competent doctor, will tell you that the symptoms you’re experiencing are directly related to depression and anxiety and/or other mental health issues. Why not visit a doctor? Are you really that thick that you think marijuana is causing all of your problems? Why not be better safe than sorry? It’s okay to be depressed. Depression isn’t what it’s drawn out to be in tv and movies, it’s a lot more complex and deeper than that. You can continue to blame your issues on marijuana, but you’re not going to improve your mental health by ignoring a condition."
Petioles,fc9vx4h,t1_fc9rwuj,1577558986.0,"It’s easy to say that, isn’t it. Life can be going great and depression can still set it. You can call bullshit on me all day, just do some research on depression and you’ll come to find the answer."
Petioles,fc9rq71,t1_fc9qezy,1577557217.0,"Okay, and I’m telling you that you need to visit a doctor because physical withdrawal symptoms from cannabis don’t exist. Even the most extreme studies finessed by the drug war will tell you that. You should also visit a doctor to get you depression under control. Any minor changes in your lifestyle (such as discontinuing the use of cannabis) can cause you to lift up out of a depressive slump. Just because there is an amount of correlation doesn’t mean that it is the direct cause."
Petioles,fc9p3rg,t1_fc9n8xw,1577556033.0,"The information that is currently out there has been proven to be incorrect time after time and we’re learning more daily. Look into the recent study that came out about fertility. Just like most studies on marijuana, it has been proven that was believed before is the total opposite of fact. So, why should I believe outdated studies that were funded by the drug war, giving bias to the studies? If information on the drug is continuing to be disproven, then why would I rely on outdated info??

Petioles,fc9jv48,t3_egn4mr,1577553738.0,"Where do all of these made up symptoms and issues come from. Does the placebo effect have that far of a reach? I’m a daily smoker, I have no problems stopping for prolonged periods of time and I’m DEFINITELY not experiencing all these “withdrawal” symptoms you guys are talking about. Same goes for every pot smoker I know. Are you guys sure this shit isn’t just all in your heads and it’s mental issues that you’re ignoring and blaming marijuana dependency for? If you’re really THAT proud that you need to tell people that you’ve only smoked a few times in a few months, then you probably have some deeper issues that need talked about/resolved with a doctor."
