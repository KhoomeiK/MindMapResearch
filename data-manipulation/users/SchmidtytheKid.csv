Excess water and moisture in a burrito that you intend to freeze for later is not a good thing I’ve found. It messes with the texture and flavor and it might end up soggy when it’s reheated which is gross."

For dinner I’ll have these or just cook a single meal depending on how I’m feeling. But I’m ok with eating the same thing for lunch and supper several days or a week in a row. You could also dress these up a bit for supper by baking them with some extra cheese on top in some enchilada sauce.

Just make sure it doesn’t add too much moisture to the ingredients mixture. If the mixture of ingredients is too wet when you roll the burritos they will be soggy when you go to heat them up later.

Not included was the taco seasoning I used for the chicken and the beans. It was a homemade blend made with cumin, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, flour, brown sugar and cayenne pepper. I added some salt to the chicken when I baked it, but other than that there was no additional salt added to anything. 

Total cost was $18.50 for 16 burritos and the chicken was $10 of that cost. So cut out the chicken or use less and drop the price per burrito significantly. I also used 10"" tortillas so a person can adjust if they prefer smaller or larger tortillas than that.

Additionally I steam my tortillas in the microwave to make them more pliable. I place a damp dish towel in the microwave and place the tortilla on top of that for 30 seconds. Comes out just like a Chipotle tortilla off their steamer."
