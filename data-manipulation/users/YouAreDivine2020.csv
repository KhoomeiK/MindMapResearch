I’m with you about 50% there. 

Disengaging is a self-care tactic. So good for you that you have learned that strategy. I was taught it very early on in life and sadly I think I have very few friends because of it but justify it as “they’re a burden on me.” Because that’s what I was taught. Not to care for myself but that there are leaches everywhere and being a social person I learned the hard way that not everyone has my best interests in mind. 

Looking out for yourself, by yourself isn’t easy and it’s not natural either. We are social beings. We are tribal in nature. We rely on everyone. It is truly a collective. Thank god for the Internet. If you don’t have an answer, you can find it nearly instantaneously. But what if you have never been given the answer? Like what is the meaning of life? Or better yet, what is your purpose? If you can’t answer those two questions honestly, which most, in fact 86% of the human population according to Gallop, apparently can’t, then you’re going to be in a perpetual state of suffering. You are experiencing an existential crisis. And that shit hurts to the core. 

My point being that you seem like a confident person that is able to manage their life in a manner that allows you to ask why others cannot do the same. Rather than asking why they can’t, why not ask how you can help? I know we both have a propensity to withdrawal ourselves from poison, but when you climb the mountain and you’re standing up there alone, it might be a good time to reach down and lift up your brother or sister and let them know it’s going to be ok and how. 

I don’t have the answer but I’m on the path and it took nearly forty years for me to realize I’ve been on the path my whole life but no one showed me the path. I had to have a moment of clarity as it sounds like you did as well, in fact 100’s of moments of clarity, and I have sought every mechanism, every tactic, every teacher that could help me to learn what I wasn’t seeing. And as I said before, I still have demons showing themselves every day of my life. But I never pass up the opportunity to help someone with their own battles. It’s my purpose. It’s my meaning for life."

Sure it’s probably an illusion that people are talking about us behind our backs, and we’re making it all up in our heads. We think it’s just “adulthood “ as well and are constantly frustrated that while we understand that, there is a constant fight or flight response firing in our brains at all times that doesn’t allow us to cope with the very natural stresses of life. In fact nearly every time I explain to someone who does not understand anxiety what makes me anxious, they nod their head and say they feel the same. It just manifests itself  in different ways in different people. If you’re in a conversation with me you’d never imagine I’m struggling as hard as I am. I stand tall, I carry myself well, and I speak confidently and directly. But it’s real shit. It’s called trauma. Not everyone understands it."
loseit,fep2dug,t3_eq8bzy,1579310597.0,YouTube has a ton of great motivational videos. I get super pumped to get up and get at it when I watch them right before bed. Motiversity and Be Inspired have been huge. Go down the rabbit hole. It’s all there. I would also convince yourself that you’re doing it for more than just losing weight. 145 is probably your resting weight it may feel bad but your body may just be comfortable there. What does your workout and diet look like?
loseit,fep1lde,t3_eq3okx,1579310097.0,Good for you!
offmychest,femyof8,t3_epndfj,1579272986.0,"Life is fucking hard. For all of the reasons you mention and more. You did something very brave and courageous today though. You shared your feelings with a bunch of fucking strangers who could’ve judged you and yet everyone feels the same or has had similar experiences, time and fucking time again (lol). You have now influenced so many people. You’ve given a voice to people whom wouldn’t have said anything and kept it hidden deep down inside like an infectious poison. You are a champion. You are good enough. Just keep moving forward."
offmychest,femx3es,t1_fekuqv0,1579271875.0,No doubt. You have to be yourself at all times. As long as you’re not hurting anyone then do you. There are methods of changing your perspective though that don’t compromise your integrity but allow you to face adversity with a more positive outlook that doesn’t lead to the demise of your essence. Stay strong everyone.
