I kind of understand where you’re coming from.  He was my same age... childhood best friend... whom I also had a crush on. Was manipulated and pressured to do things to him. I’ve only ever told my mother and sister. It sucks, and I hate that you can’t tell anyone. I hope somehow you can get some therapy or at least some kind of anxiety/ptsd meds. I wish nothing but the best for you."

Psychic,fgl28bj,t3_ez3tb7,1580879751.0,Hey there. I’m Emily. I was wondering if Jason and I will ever get back together? We were together for nearly a decade and we have a 4yr old together.
AMA,fgl0gxj,t3_ez3uxh,1580878284.0,"This may be a weird question, but do you know anything concerning tv antennas?"
AMA,fgl0e6m,t1_fgl0790,1580878225.0,"Thank you. It was... a lot of ptsd. I hate death. Time has taken away some pain, but never will completely."
AMA,fgl024i,t3_ez2g13,1580877952.0,Oh ok. Well she was immediately taken to the coroners office. After she was found.
AMA,fgkxy01,t1_fgkxjdl,1580876313.0,"Oh you mean the swelling and all in a funeral home for viewing would be odd? It def was her, and I’m sure my BIL went to identify her after they got her from the house. She wasn’t embalmed."
AMA,fgkx9gs,t1_fgkwmo9,1580875805.0,"Right. One more question, how do they close the eyes nowadays? And the mouths? And what if one hasn’t been embalmed? My sister wasn’t, so only us adults could view her, as it would’ve been traumatic to the kids... regardless. I just remember her being so swollen... which I know is gas build up and whatnot. I’m pretty sure though her eyes were just glued shut, bc one of them looked open a tad in the middle.. and she didn’t have many teeth toward the end due to a calcium deficiency along with the pills I assume... a lot of ppl would’ve thought she did drugs, but she could barely smoke weed out of a pipe and we all knew better than that. Anyways, besides the point. Rant over."
AMA,fgkwevg,t1_fgkv11f,1580875196.0,Thank you so much.. I know she’s in a much better place now though. She was cremated. Do you know how that process goes? As in how long do they stay in the funeral home before cremation?
AMA,fgkuseb,t1_fgkttdw,1580874082.0,"Oh ok. My sister accidentally overdosed sept 2018, and no one was home at the time... so she had to have an autopsy even though we pretty much knew the cause.... she was already cold and was stiff. I think she died around midnight and my nephew found her around 2 or so that day. I was wondering also how does the funeral home dress them, and get them into the caskets or boxes for viewing with them being so stiff?"
AMA,fgktnv7,t1_fgkrwxt,1580873352.0,Oh ok. Do they go straight to the funeral home? What if the body needs to be autopsied?
AMA,fgkrdqo,t3_ez2g13,1580871917.0,What in the world is a body collection? How would you sell dead bodies?

But I don’t want so much in my system ya know? Even tho it’s baby doses of it all lol I’ll prob just take it up in the morning hours cause I don’t want to mess up my tapering schedule"
depression,fgjtlnz,t1_fgjsrzz,1580851146.0,"That’s horrible parenting. I mean most of these stories I read on here in the depression sub are from young adults and almost always it has to do with their parents. I’m so sorry you were told that and it skewed your view of yourself forever. Just know that it’s not the truth and that they’re the ones that’s messed up In the head. Probably shouldn’t have said that but parents these days are just so ignorant it’s hard to even comprehend how they tie their shoes every morning. Lol I grew up skinny too, still am, loved playing basketball, but never had the stamina or endurance to run and shoot for long even though I was a great shooter. I planed whenever we had the chance to in P.E. My sisters and I never had the opportunity to try out or be on any teams in school bc we were poor, and both of my parents then were alcoholics full time. Never really cared about our feelings/schoolwork. Anyway, pm me if you want, I’ll give you some advice as a mother myself."
