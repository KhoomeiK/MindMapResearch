  When it comes to fascism everything is deliberate and meant to lead people along to the next step toward the “solution.”  and with nazism so much of it is symbolic and cultish, so no odes or tributes are completely innocent or candid; such as “the kind of music someone likes.”  Because a nazi wouldn’t appreciate music written or performed by a jewish musician—not because “sometimes people just don’t like a certain song.” The nazi doesn’t just *prefer* Wagner, they are *required* to *promote* wagner, because that is part of the regimes fascist agenda; so again there are no coincidences in a nazi regime.


When it comes to cultish or fascist ideologies, one should assume that the message has been carefully crafted, the visuals and aesthetic are always set up, and the leader is constantly extending his or her power—therefore they are *always* several steps ahead of the people, *especially* to unassuming outsiders who don't recognize the total context, like a person tuning into a tv series mid season.  Hitler operated for years in ambiguity to world leaders in regards to the most heinous and offensive war crimes from the genocides to the invasions.

They stay ahead by constant persuasion/brainwashing for the passive and with force for those who resist or are “unbecoming” of he fascist agenda."
