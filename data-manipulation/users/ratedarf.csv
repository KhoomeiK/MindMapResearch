relationship_advice,ffklrk7,t3_etydfx,1580024854.0,"Something my husband and I have put to good use in our marriage: mirror and validate. Many times people want to be heard more than anything. I would recommend you mirror what she’s saying (basically repeat what she’s said so she’s sure you “get” it) and then tell her she has every right to her feelings. Validate what she’s feeling as okay. It doesn’t mean you’re wrong and she’s right, it’s just to work through the initial, raw emotions. My husband and I experienced something that might be parallel in some ways. Years ago, I had a medical event that related to my cervix. Being a young, new husband my spouse asked his parents for advice on how to support me through this. I was livid — not because I thought he did something with any kind of bad intention, but because I felt violated. I didn’t want his parents knowing about or talking about issues related to my body. I threw a fit. (In therapy parlance I’m a “hailstorm” and he’s a “turtle.”) The first thing I needed from him in that moment of anger was not an explanation or justification. I just needed to be heard, then validated. Then when things calmed down we were able to have a rational discussion about how to fix things going forward. The key is to understand that mirroring and validating are a way to help in that initial fit of outrage. It’s like in customer service — the first, best thing a representative can do with an unhappy customer is say to them. “I understand what you’re feeling and I would feel the same way if I were you.”  [Often this isn’t 100 percent true — and that relates to “otherness,” another great concept that has helped our marriage — it is the idea that we don’t all respond the way someone else would in a certain situation. Accepting my husband’s otherness (and he mine) has helped our relationship immensely.] Start the next conversation with these techniques and see if they work. If she then calms down and does ask about why you did what you did, you can then explain. Once my feelings are taken care of in most of my conflicts with my husband we are then able to proceed from a place of logic and reason. In the aforementioned situation. I came to understand why my spouse reached out to his family. It didn’t mean I liked it any more than I did before. But I wasn’t angry because I felt truly heard and I knew going forward we wouldn’t have that same kind of problem again.  Did we have other weird situations that were a big deal to me but not to him? Of course. For example, he told a female friend of his that she should come decorate our place because I don’t know how. I was furious because I don’t like appearing inadequate to other women. It hurt my ego. He didn’t mean it hurtfully. He’s on the autism spectrum so, when he hears me complain about things like my bad decorating, he goes out looking for solutions. Despite his lack of bad intentions I was still hurt and angry. Once again, he just needed to mirror and validate my feelings and then we had a rational conversation and everything was resolved. And I do the same in return when he has been hurt or offended by my actions. My hope for you is that your wife gives you a chance to listen to her and let her air her feelings. And then she eventually moves on to a solution going forward."

grammar,ffk220t,t1_ffjzzzp,1580013409.0,"I appreciate the perspective everyone is providing. I strive to use the same rules for speaking and writing. Then again, I grew up aware of how improperly my family spoke and saw how they were misjudged as a result. It made me sensitive to being correct in the spoken and written word. I guess I’ll have to cut my actor friends (the ones who tend to have the loosest grammar) some slack. It hurts my ears to hear their poor grammar and I thought people might judge them for sounding uneducated, but I guess “informal” is a good way to see it."

I am from the rural South and grew up in a mostly uneducated household so I can appreciate your Appalachian upbringing — those are my people, as they say. I always saw writing and speaking as a way out of our poverty so I like to say I learned how to speak from Jack Tripped on Three’s Company in terms of leaving accents behind. But, yes, I grew up diagramming sentences and seeing correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation as tools to get me into a better situation. I earned a scholarship to a great university and made my way 3,000 miles from home. But I work as a writer so I tend to emphasize elements of language that might be more fluid these days. I’m old-school in many ways. Sometimes it’s hard to know if woke Twitter represents the real world or just a loud portion of it. I appreciate folks educating me on here."

I can’t remember the sub; I was just thrown by seeing it in written form, and it reminded me of how often my friends say things like this as well. As a resident of Los Angeles where the school system has far bigger problems than grammar, I can appreciate your point. But as someone who has observed conversations about grammar rules being racist I was genuinely curious if it was still being taught in school. I don’t have children and am approaching 50, so I have been out of the education loop for decades."

iamatotalpieceofshit,ff5iue3,t1_ff57vgd,1579594880.0,It’s common enough in China because there aren’t animal welfare laws there. China’s government considers attempts to elevate animals beyond “things” as western imperialism. And those who are animal activists come into conflict with those who abuse animals or sell them for meat. (The markets there sell all kinds of live animals.) The animal traders will torture them in front of activists because they can. [Fight Dog Meat](www.fightdogmeat.com) has a video of an abuser throwing a puppy to the ground and stomping it to death just to anger the activists trying to save them.  But sadly China isn’t alone in its disregard for animals.

relationship_advice,febm3zc,t3_eo8m1p,1578960245.0,"Her demands and expectations aren’t reasonable. Period. These are not the behaviors of someone I would ever want to call a friend. But if you consider her someone worth keeping in your life, then save her from herself. Explain to her that making demands — especially financial ones — isn’t what weddings, friendship, and marriage are about. (God help her husband-to-be if this is how she acts.) Is she living by Kardashian or Instagram standards? Whom is she trying to impress? When you make these kinds of demands and requests before the wedding it’s unlikely you will have a pleasurable wedding day. It speaks to unrealistic expectations and putting value on the wrong things. Whatever is corrupting her values, it is better to confront her now. If she receives your kindly worded candor well, then great — figure out a plan and move forward in your friendship. If she receives it poorly, then tell her it’s endangering your friendship and pull back from the wedding... and her. It speaks to a kind of selfishness and toxic behavior you do not want to have in your life. Old friends don’t necessarily mean friends forever. People change. It can be hard but growing apart and letting go can also be liberating as you more clearly define who you are and what you value in a friend. Weddings are meant to celebrate the uniting of lives — they shouldn’t bankrupt you financially or, in this case, both financially and emotionally. I have been married almost ten years and my wedding cost probably $100. We got married at his family’s home on the back porch with no fanfare. I don’t even remember if I had a bouquet. We planned it according to the means we had at the time. What I remember is the people who were around us and the love we felt. It was a true circle of fellowship and celebration. By contrast, I was a bridesmaid in a very high-end wedding with a bride from a wealthy background (not so wealthy that they paid for everything, however) and she never made such demands of any of us. Was it ultimately expensive to be in her wedding? Yes. Mostly because of the dress and hotel accommodations. But she didn’t demand we stay in the nice hotel nor did she expect gifts of a certain dollar value.  And when I couldn’t afford to attend her bachelorette spa weekend I gifted her a really nice bottle of wine and a card expressing my regrets. There was no drama because she is a kind human being who isn’t a narcissistic monster. You really need to examine your friend’s behavior and call it what it is — entitled and rude. When you get to an age where you’re in multiple weddings within a few years — that level of paying for things adds up, so do not set a precedent with this one. If you do you’ll always feel on the hook to perform/ pay at a certain level. Save yourself. And ask yourself if the friendship is worth saving as well."

Filmmakers,fdmf9c2,t1_fdmepcz,1578547953.0,It doesn’t hurt but it doesn’t prevent someone from stealing the general idea. The more important thing is to have a spotless script that looks professional and at the very least works as a stellar writing sample.
Filmmakers,fdmewtd,t1_fdme3p4,1578547636.0,"But also... things that annoyed me as a script reader: poor characterization, clunky dialogue, trying too hard to be clever, obtuse action/ descriptions. The read should be easy and draw in the reader. The tone of the writing should match the genre. A comedy should have fairly zippy action descriptions. A thriller should convey pulse-pounding action and atmosphere. Read the screenplay for Zodiac. The first 30 pages or so are a master class in writing tone."
Filmmakers,fdmen1s,t1_fdme3p4,1578547393.0,"Formatting, spelling, grammar, subject-verb agreement — it all matters. That being said, if it’s an exceptional story they might still buy it but get rid of you as the writer. Hire someone who knows screenplay format, as well as the difference between your and you’re, its and it’s to proofread your screenplay. If your script is in rough shape don’t send it. If it exceeds the recommended length of 120 pages, you should probably wait and cut it down. I can’t recommend this enough: get an entertainment attorney to protect you and to read contracts (some work on contingency) before you sign anything. And never ghostwrite unless you’re getting paid millions. Otherwise it’s not worth it. Screen credit is your currency as a writer."
Filmmakers,fdme104,t3_em4jeo,1578546853.0,"Is the script polished?

AmItheAsshole,fdka2z8,t1_fdk9e2e,1578499483.0,I was just thinking about her hormones. I know mine used to make me weepy and feel awful in terms of self-image around my period. I was referring to that. Then again I know nothing about pregnancy hormones. I will simply wish her well in making her decision and just accept that I’m not keen on calling people a-holes in this situation.
AmItheAsshole,fdk941z,t1_fdk7xeg,1578498874.0,"Maybe it’s a conversation better suited for a less vulnerable time for the wife...? I agree with everyone in theory, but I also think about it in practice. I guess if she were my wife I’d probably come down on the side of making her comfortable than forcing her to be just. I simply can’t imagine ever insisting my husband is an a-hole for being uncomfortable with something. But at the same time I totally get that it’s technically wrong to do. I guess I have just had to counsel too many situations and have rarely seen people as a-holes for the feelings they have. Given my lack is ability to be harsh this might not be the best sub for me."
AmItheAsshole,fdk74r9,t1_fdk57yc,1578497600.0,"And those are absolutely the situations where I see you as 100 percent correct. That’s exactly the kind of thing where my fairness instincts override any empathy
I have for someone’s feelings of discomfort. And if this were a regular workplace I would say you have to ignore any feelings and hire based on qualifications, period. I guess as a woman who lives in a city where trading for the younger, hotter person is the norm, where youth and beauty are valued so highly I didn’t see her so much as an a-hole but as human. And I’m projecting my own experiences in an almost absurdly wonderful marriage where we talk these things out and his spectrum-ness has created scenarios where I don’t understand but I respect his feelings and we just let that be that, and vice versa. (To be clear they’re never matters of race, sex, or anything of that sort.) This tendency of mine to imagine so many scenarios that make someone not the a-hole is also why I could never be a judge! I hope that this woman and her husband have a happy, healthy marriage and a great time raising their kids."
AmItheAsshole,fdk4svl,t1_fdjwdll,1578496055.0,"I understand your point and generally agree (I can see all the scenarios where you’re correct)... but I think differently when it comes to matters of feeling uncomfortable with someone in your home on a regular basis. If it were reversed and my husband asked me not to hire someone because they made him uncomfortable I would respect his feelings. He’s on the spectrum so I don’t always understand where he’s coming from or what makes him feel the way he does.
We have discussed our “otherness” at length and so for me I have just encountered so many situations where a feeling of discomfort dictates decision making... so we pretty much talk things out and respect one another. Even when I don’t understand or agree, I just respect his feelings. He does the same for me. I also just have a lot of sympathy for women who are pregnant, just had children, etc. Even though I’ve never had children I appreciate how hormones can affect your emotions and your sense of self-image. And how much pressure there is for women to get their “body back” after baby. Sometimes it’s just very hard to feel good about yourself right away. So I was thinking about all the challenges the mom will already face once kids arrive; I didn’t see it as a bad thing for her to look for someone who gave her one less thing to stress about when the baby arrives."

Otherwise you’re an enabler; drug addiction is a progressive disease so giving them a comfortable situation in which to feed their addiction isn’t saving them it’s hurting them. If the son really was a drug addict it’s not wrong to kick him out. People call it tough love but I consider it love to require better of someone for their own sake. Obviously we don’t have all the details. I’m just chiming in on the off chance the son wasn’t just suspected of doing drugs, that he really was."

I trust my husband entirely but I don’t know that my self esteem is strong enough for me to handle certain situations without at least feeling a little down or less than in the moment. And it’s different when you’re hiring someone to be in your home and practically become a family member by caring for your children. Being comfortable with that person is a top priority — not just their qualifications but truly deeply feeling comfortable with their presence in your space, functioning and interacting with your family.

infj,fctuofo,t3_eiirgs,1577960453.0,"I relate in that any time I see an injustice, it strikes me at my core — it tears at my sense of logic and it makes my blood boil. All wrongs have to be righted, my mind and heart tell me. My inability to correct what I witness leaves me feeling helpless and frustrated and sometimes incredibly sad. (And I’ve become a teeth grinder like so many have mentioned on here.) The solution for me is to channel the wrongs into my writing where I can correct them, where I can create the balance the real world lacks. For those whose job doesn’t allow that, the best thing I can advise is to find a hobby or outlet where you either control it completely (even something as basic as knitting) or where you’re doing some good. I do a lot with animal shelters and it can break your heart and make you hate humans. But I keep doing it because I’m helping and I get to communicate with some like minded people who care the way I do. Just seeing their outrage over the same wrongs actually makes me feel less alone. And that is soothing in its own way. I also just make as much time as possible to be alone and do things I find therapeutic like cleaning and organizing. I find the fewer items I have cluttering my physical space, it actually helps declutter my mental space and that leaves me just a tad less frustrated on a daily basis."

They’re not cheap but you’ll keep them a long time and they have multiple uses. Also if you shop at the right time or sign up and get a coupon you can get a decent price. I’ve slowly been building my collection of them to organize my closet and they’re a dream for this kind of storage."

entitledparents,fcithc5,t3_ehawx8,1577669421.0,"I am so sorry for your girlfriend’s experience. I don’t know if this will help, but I actually went through something similar with my own mother — not just once. Probably dozens of times. To offer a story in line with your girlfriend’s horrible experience: one Christmas I was back in my hometown, but staying at my then-boyfriend’s parents’ home because the house where I grew up was in such bad shape it no longer had a bathroom. (My family was always poor and just got poorer as the years went on.) Christmas morning my mother called me and was making plans for us to meet up to have our Christmas together. I told her I wanted a few minutes to sleep in. Literally just that. But that was all it took for her to fly off the handle and CANCEL Christmas. To her it it was some sort of rejection much like a parent telling a small child NO and then the kid throws a tantrum. Only the tantrum doesn’t stop and the child can never be placated. I spent the entire day bawling my eyes out. I kept blaming myself and regretting that I had somehow upset her. Not to mention being completely embarrassed by the fact that my boyfriend’s family was now privy to the emotional abuse I tried to keep secret; I always wanted to keep people from seeing my mother as abusive. (She, too, told me I was worthless... and a lot more colorful expletives my whole life. Almost every single day.) That was then. This is now. It took until I was in mid-30s (ten years ago) for me to learn that my mother wasn’t being trigged by ME being a bad daughter. My mother has borderline personality disorder, summed up beautifully by the title of the book, “I Hate You, Don’t Leave Me.” It explained (but did not excuse) all her childish tantrums and behaviors. She had kept me and my older siblings in a constant state of fear and that’s how she controlled us, and beat us down. She was verbally and physically abusive in a bizarre effort to keep us with her. I was lucky because I got away from her for college and grad school and then moved away and eventually learned enough about her disorder to stop personalizing her attacks and her attempts to manipulate me. I literally got a second cell phone with a different number for her to call and leave her hateful and harassing messages. And with time I started to see her verbal vitriol as no less personal than someone shouting at invisible demons on the street. Yes, it hurt me for a LONG time growing up and it made my childhood miserable. And delayed my development of self-esteem. But now I look at her like someone would a microbe — I can examine her under the microscope but I know enough about her dangers to not allow her to affect me. I don’t know the source of your gf’s mother’s behavior. But I do recommend that your girlfriend try to ween herself from being so deeply affected by her mother’s cruel behavior. As a southerner I grew up believing that you love your family no matter how they treat you. And I do still love my family but it doesn’t mean I like, support, condone, participate in, or allow myself to absorb their bad or abusive behavior. Period. I erase my mother’s messages when they’re full of venom. I had to work at it a lot to not see myself through the lens my mother’s words describe. It takes time and some serious self-analysis but it can be done. For most daughters a mother is a very influential person in their lives. Someone they desperately want to please. But one day I realized — I could have a billion dollars and run a movie studio and my mother would still criticize my achievement. It’s her behavioral pattern and it hasn’t improved in the almost 5 decades of my life. So, hard as it was, I let go of the “making mama proud” dream and learned to take my sense of accomplishment from within. She might not be capable of changing her cruel behavior but I can change how I allow it to affect me. From that realization I have managed to grow SO much in my career. Now I’m living my dreams and I have boundaries. I don’t tell my mother about hardly anything of importance in my life — anything I don’t want her to tear down, she doesn’t know about... which is mostly everything. I share my experience in case your gf endures the same kind of familial pressure and manipulation I did. Because if she does — boundaries and a refusal to believe in abusive words helped me a lot. It can be hard for a daughter to say she no longer wants to please her mother. But if her mother is unreasonable — whatever the underlying cause, borderline personality disorder just happened to be at the root of my story — then it’s okay to keep the relationship but change the dynamic and how it’s allowed to impact her. She did nothing wrong. Her mother is wrong. It’s okay for her to acknowledge she behaved well and her mother did not. It’s simple but powerful when it finally breaks through. (Oh and BLESS YOU for seeing the mom’s behavior for what it is and standing up for your GF. I talked so many people into letting my mom be abusive. I could have used a hero like you when I was young. Well done.)"

aww,fc9w0co,t1_fc9qivw,1577559022.0,"If you google Yulin Dog Meat Festival or go to fightdogmeat.com you will see the videos of the torture. It mainly comes down to there being no animal welfare laws in places like China so if you’re heartless and want to eat an animal that you first need to kill, you can just beat it to death or boil it alive or whatever. Some might do the torture for a misguided belief that adrenaline helps the flavor, others do it because why not. It’s just a “thing.” The government doesn’t see animals as worth protecting - they are just “things” so people can pretty much do anything to a dog or cat that they want. I’ve seen the videos of torture on the streets, at the festivals, and in private homes where “pet owners” just decide to torture their own dogs and brutally murder them. Even in front of their own children. They are so awful I won’t describe them. But if they happened in America we would scream “future serial killer.” While eating various kinds of meat is indeed cultural, what happens to dogs in China and Vietnam is slightly different because some are stolen pets. However, it was seeing the fear and helplessness of dogs about to be slaughtered in the streets of China (the sounds are horrific) that put me on the path to veganism — it made me realize that the main difference between what happens to dogs over there and cows/ pigs over here is that we don’t see it. Sorry for the long comment. This topic is just deeply affecting to me."
aww,fc9t28w,t1_fc9aacw,1577557796.0,"I followed Chi Chi on Instagram until her death. Her family still posts videos and photos of her. She was amazing and resilient and gave love and inspiration to many, myself included. There are thousands of survivors of the dog meat trade that are living wonderful lives around the world, primarily in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. Some still have the physical (and psychological) scars of their ordeal. The organizations that rescue dogs from this trade are true heroes: they put their safety and freedom (and emotional health) on the line to rescue dogs from really violent, nasty meat traders who give zero f’s about any living thing. But Chi Chi was a bright, bright light in a story that began in dark circumstances."

I love my husband — an INTJ on the spectrum who enjoys being alone as well — and I love a few close friends... but I don’t need to see them. Hardly ever. I want to believe I love human kind but these days it’s only in the most theoretical sense. For me it’s exhausting to have some of the mindless interactions involved in the day to day. I don’t need those interactions so if I can avoid them I do. Anything on a deeper level — if people are making poor decisions, or if they believe in an unjust system (according to my values) then I feel like I am wasting my time. And I hate wasting my time. I mainly love animals and animal causes because even the most violent and aggressive animals aren’t that way out of a desire to be cruel. That’s exclusive to mankind. The cruelty and absurdity of man is mind boggling and, again, becomes a time suck and a source of frustration if I choose to participate in it."
