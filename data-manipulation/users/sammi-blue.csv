Drew from 4th grade was such a shithead that the main antagonist of my book (that I've been writing off and on since 6th grade) is named Andrew/Drew, haha. It truly is an asshole name."

I'm lucky, my high school is REALLY big on football (we've had a few alumni go professional, like some pretty big-name players) (as far as I've been told at least, I don't watch football haha) but is performing arts kids got a brand-new performing arts building with a proper theater before they put in a new football field. We also had a science building that was less than 5 years old when I started high school, I believe that was the first of the renovations.

Some of the other buildings were falling apart though, haha. It was a very weird polarity, brand new buildings with ones that hadn't been updated in decades."

quityourbullshit,ffoh04e,t3_eu8yv6,1580077552.0,"You have to fuck up EXTREMELY badly for the state to completely terminate your parental rights. You can totally make an argument that some kids get taken for silly reasons, but those are temporary situations and the system's main goal is reunification... Again, you have to fuck up pretty badly to end that shit permanently.

My ex BIL somehow still has partial custody over my niece even though he's a drug addict, doesn't have a stable job, is constantly moving (he hears voices and always thinks his neighbors are spying on him, even if the unit next to him is empty), has defied court orders and has explicitly told the police that he wouldn't follow court orders (for a period of time he legally wasn't allowed to have his kid overnight, and one day he was just like ""actually, I'm gonna keep her overnight and her mom will get her back when I decide to give her back"". Cops did nothing, fyi). He's kept the kid home from school for no reason, and has sent her to school with nothing but junk food for lunch to the point where school staff noticed and had her get school lunch so she would have something nutritious to eat.... Kid is only in 1st grade and already thinks school is pointless and talks about how she wants her dad to ""homeschool"" her instead, aka he gives her a tablet and lets her stay up until 2am... Yet putting a child through THAT is somehow better than not having the child see him at all.

So yeah, if you get your kid taken away for good, that means you're most likely worse than my BIL and you do not deserve your children, plain and simple.

TheHandmaidsTale,ffmy3yi,t1_ffku73y,1580060114.0,"""Blaming the victim""? They're pointing out a writing inconsistency/character flaw/something they don't like in a FICTIONAL TELEVISION SHOW. There is no victim because June doesn't exist. All of her actions are decided by a team of writers who make decisions that not everyone is going to agree with, and people have a right to point out when they don't agree without being accused of victim blaming or wanting women to be oppressed.

Again, trying to equate criticizing a piece of media to harming abuse victims is ridiculous and detracts from the ACTUAL victim blaming that REAL-LIFE abuse victims go through."
TheHandmaidsTale,ffkrpw4,t1_ffkq4f1,1580027713.0,"Again: are you seriously implying that OP WANTS women to be oppressed and raped because they dared to make a criticism about a FICTITIOUS show? Holy shit yall need to get a life. It's a television show. It's made for entertainment. It has flaws, just like literally any other form of media, and acting like disliking something about it = justifying rape and oppression is disgusting and completely detracts from actual, real-life victims of rape and abuse."

UCDavis,ffivr3f,t3_etnnf5,1579983871.0,"As someone who pretty much had no friends until winter quarter of my sophomore year (and even then I only had like 2), I totally understand the struggle. Story that hurt at the time but is kinda funny in retrospect: one of my roommates freshman year was very outgoing and always making friends, she dragged me to a Cards Against Humanity game that was happening on our dorm floor... By the end of the game, a guy we were both kinda chatting with was like ""hey can I get your Snapchat?"" and, since we were together, I figured he meant both of us. He added her, saw that I was holding out my phone, and went ""...oh. Yeah, I guess I can add you too"" LMAO

Anyways, my tip is make sure you're making an effort. You might not become bffs with everyone you try to talk to, but being friendly with someone is so much better than not. I have a lot of ""friends"" in the sense that we don't hang out, but we chat in class and help each other with homework. Trying to establish those kinds of connections first can pave the way to actually being friends! If you see that a person has several classes with you, just be like ""hey you're in \_\_\_, right? What did you think of the homework?"" etc.

Also, definitely go to any clubs or events that look interesting to you. It hasn't worked for me personally, but I know for a lot of people it can help establish a connection!

I feel like it'd be nice for people on this subreddit to organize a day where people who want more friends can meet up and do something!"

Just a note to anyone reading: if you're looking to do a trail ride, keep in mind that if it's hella cheap there's probably something going on. Volunteered at a horse ranch in hs that was 40$/hour which is VERY cheap for the area and they treated the horses like shit."

That's what my best friend is trying to do. Only place that provides jobs is the local Walmart. Mental health issues meant he barely graduated high school, his older siblings are fuck ups in some way or another (one has a drug problem) so him, his mother, and grandmother get stuck helping out them and their kids, plus whatever health issues come up between all of them... He basically never has enough money leftover to save up for a car, let alone college classes (he wants to become a teacher) or even just a way to move out of his bumfuck area. It hurts to see, especially since I've lived a very different, privileged life and I know that he deserves so much more."
HumansBeingBros,ffe7yj7,t1_ffdxxer,1579839151.0,"I mean, I think if these kinds of people were more open about what they do it would give people (especially kids/teens) a role model and a boost of positivity in their lives. People always bitch about how ""people these days only care about the Kardashians hur hur"" but that's because those people are so visible. Imagine if wonderful people like this doctor were as easy to connect with/learn about as Youtubers are-- the kids who would feel inspired to go into their field, the people who are interested in the subject and just want to learn something new, the people who just want some good news. Not to mention, in this woman's case, the countless amount of people who have been affected by cervical cancer and HPV who just want to know who's responsible for saving so many lives"

Your entire story is awful and I'm so sorry that you had that experience, but I just wanted to point out how mind-blowingly stupid this statement in particular is... As you said, scars aren't always visible-- and besides, there might not be any scars to show! I've self harmed before as well, off and on for years, but I only have one little scar to show for it. Doesn't mean I didn't self-harm, just means I harmed in a way that made scarring unlikely."
UCDavis,ffcsr24,t3_esx044,1579806502.0,"Yup. First time I went to counseling here (or ever, for that matter), the guy didn't have his degree yet iirc and he was like a robot spouting phrases from a psych textbook. I was crying because I was overwhelmed and was telling him about how my life sucked, and when I paused to hear his input he was like ""... So how much caffeine do you drink? That can cause anxiety :) "" as if my 1 soda per day is the reason I have a toxic/neglectful family.

Another time (with a different person that I actually kinda like), I was filling out the questionnaire and answered yes to a question that was something like ""I've thought about or have hurt myself or others in the past two weeks"" (or maybe it asked if you thought about self harm/suicide, idk) and there was literally no follow-up, either with the counselor or after the appointment, which tells me they don't actually look at the questionnaire at all... Lord forbid someone answers yes and they do nothing and the person ends up killing themselves.

Also, I've gone to make appointments and they'd be closed for lunch which has definitely prevented me from making appointments (phone calls give me anxiety and they don't let you schedule online!!), not to mention their hours can be pretty restrictive, which goes for the whole health center tbh."

The best way to address it might just be to sit down and have a discussion with him about it. Bonus points if you can bring up specific examples of his behavior and how it's unhealthy/untrue (like ""I don't think it was right for you to call Stacey a slut, I know it sucks that she broke up with you but she's nice and she had valid reasons for ending it"").

You obviously know your friend better than we do, but be careful about too much or too little criticism. Some people need a good, hard wake-up call and would benefit from being told that they're acting like a douche--other people will shut down and get more aggressive if they hear that. A lot of people suggested showing him this sub, but keep in mind that he might perceive it as an attack/making fun of people who are in the right (especially if he's in pain over something rn; again, you know him better than we do). When I was being kind of a shitty person a few years back (not a niceguy, but comparable), being told that I was being unreasonable and that I should just get over it made me spiral more-- only when I was given sympathy and the chance to feel validated was I finally able to move past it and realize that I wasn't making good decisions. So just be aware of what your homie needs. Good luck to you!"

It seems pretty easy to pronounce to me, don't change yourself just because some people won't take an extra 5 seconds to figure out how to say it.
