offmychest,fepvxaf,t3_eqddhi,1579333228.0,I’m so sorry to hear that you got treated that way. That is horrible and I know how much more mistreatment hurts when you’re already suffering. It is not your fault. She must simply be a miserable person because no sensible human intentionally responds that way to someone who’s sick. When will you see a doctor? I hope it isn’t severe and that you get better soon.
BodyDysmorphia,fej7maa,t3_epf5qf,1579160299.0,"Hey, what did you do today?"
offmychest,fefz4rl,t3_eojf0n,1579070200.0,"My 24 year old brother recently passed two weeks ago. I completely understand how you feel. If you would like to talk to someone about it, I am here :)"
SuicideWatch,fe0zrdl,t1_fe082n3,1578820829.0,Do you care for and love yourself?
self,fdjoy7m,t3_elr8yr,1578481532.0,Of course not. Life is more than friendships. You’re discussing how you have little female friends but what does that have to do with the real YOU? That does not determine anything about yourself.
Fitness,fdirun5,t1_fdimo1w,1578449636.0,Phew! Do you know if they will continue to appear unevenly or altogether gradually?
Fitness,fdirirs,t1_fdiq1x3,1578449426.0,"This helped a lot, thank you for sharing :)"
Fitness,fdirbcu,t1_fdiqnfn,1578449295.0,Impressive
Fitness,fdir6bz,t1_fdimcmt,1578449206.0,"I’m really relieved, thank you!"
BodyDysmorphia,fdijtrn,t1_fdijdlk,1578444510.0,"This condition is pure horrible. It honestly makes me not want to get married or participate in the joys of life. The emotions of this condition seem so ‘it’s not that serious’ to others, have you ever truly been understood? I’m graduating school this year and am not attending formal (prom) simply because of this. I really do want to however. What about you?"
BodyDysmorphia,fdij3au,t3_eldrvy,1578444046.0,"I feel you and the consequences are horrible. I went to make a tribute album for my passed brother and I noticed I didn’t have a single photo with him after the age of 11 due to photograph refusal. 
What are we going to do when it comes to events like our wedding and such? I wonder everyday and it makes me not want to attend occasions just so I don’t have to worry about a photo of me getting taken. 
How do you explain to others that you hate cameras without looking like an alien? I feel dramatic and self-hatred simultaneously. It’s so upsetting that many others do not understand."
family,fd8vg0p,t1_fd6q3ny,1578223973.0,"Well, be glad that you found condoms and plan B rather than a positive pregnancy test."
SuicideWatch,fd8utqh,t3_ek933e,1578223691.0,"There are some really beautiful people, places, views and experiences in the world. Just because you haven’t seen them doesn’t mean they don’t exist."
SuicideWatch,fcswguo,t3_eiqn2e,1577926861.0,“I’m going through a rough time at the moment”. At the moment isn’t forever. The world has good to offer that you won’t allow yourself to experience if you end it. Your past does not define your future. Are you satisfied with having those good years come to a complete end? They can continue if you give it a chance.
SuicideWatch,fcsvfm8,t3_eiqi9q,1577926111.0,"YOU determine who you are, and YOU take action to pursue that path. Pulling yourself down rather than up, what does that contribute? If you really intend to do better this year, then try your best to achieve that. 
Until you try your very best, don’t even consider ending your potential. You are a human, as well as everybody else, therefore you can change and succeed.

Please don’t hurt yourself anymore."
family,fcnkehb,t1_fcnijqm,1577813287.0,Thank you so much. I really appreciate this and I’m so sorry to hear about your loss. Happy new year to you.
BodyDysmorphia,fbzyqec,t3_efbagk,1577269034.0,"One day of overeating won’t ruin your physique. It takes a lot more than that to gain weight. Unless you ate thousands upon thousands of calories in a day, there’s nothing to worry about. Just give your body some time and enjoy this special time of the year. :)"
