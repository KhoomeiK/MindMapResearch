stopdrinking,ffgv793,t3_etjib2,1579915892.0,"Maybe you've heard it before, but there's this cliché which definitely struck a chord with me:

> One drink is too many, twenty is not enough

Maybe you can even replace ""twenty"" by ""one"" or ""two"". Every drink removes inhibitions, making it harder to say ""no"" to the next one.

> I’m scared about what this will mean for my uni life because of how ingrained drinking culture is, but I know I’ll have support when I need it. I can take it one day at a time. I will not drink (with you) today.

I know the feeling, and I saw quite some stories here that others didn't want to hang out with them sober, or kept pushing them to drink. Personally, the people around me were unanimously supportive of me not drinking, even if I didn't feel like telling them the whole story of why I quit drinking. The peer pressure I felt (pretty strong) to have a drink around others was actually just in my head. Deciding to quit drinking is prioritizing yourself over others, you should value your own opinion of yourself over the opinion others have of you.

Probably sounds like another cliché, but if the people you hang out with want the best for you, they will be supportive. Those who are not supportive are not friends at all, merely drinking buddies. As a not very outgoing person (even less so without alcohol), that never sounded comforting to me, as I didn't have many people to hang out with anyways, so quitting drinking felt like it would make me even more lonely. But really, (hindsight talking) the time you spend with people after too many drinks is pretty meaningless.  and if you make the effort to connect with your friends outside drinking occasions, you will actually have much more quality time with them than before and you will find that you can actually connect anytime, not just by night.

If you feel going to some party/occasion will tempt you too much, just don't do it, it's just not worth it.. If you do slip up, don't be too hard on yourself, just keep going with sobriety: every time you don't drink when you otherwise would have is an achievement."

It sounds familiar, although my chronology was the reverse of what you describe: the real underlying problems only became apparent to me after a certain amount of time sober, where I couldn't reflexively drink to avoid them anymore. It took a while: at moments I thought I finally knew all the reasons to later discover a few new ones. After a lot of time and effort spent working on those problems, moderation might actually be possible now but I'd rather give it some more time before carefully attempting.

selfimprovement,fejlh8p,t1_fejixif,1579178915.0,"Well, the exact thing you should do will depend on your specific struggle.

I think it's easiest to describe in terms of your comfort zone: repeatedly do something that's at the edge of your comfort zone: something somewhat uncomfortable that it's not effortless to do, but comfortable enough that you can still do it. This will probably feel like a too small step, but as long as there's some discomfort realize that you're making progress by doing it.
After doing that thing enough times, you will notice that your discomfort is gone and you can take a new step at the edge of your (now a bit bigger) comfort zone. 

So if your problem is with saying anything at all in a group, just aim at saying anything, just one sentence is progress. Once that feels pretty comfortable, start by say a few things. If your problem is with daring to disagree, then when you hear something insignificant that you disagree with, just say you have a different opinion."
selfimprovement,fejhn93,t3_ep6tod,1579174668.0,"This is an interesting one. I definitely understand that you shouldn't try to do too much simultaneously, that doesn't necessarily translate to focusing on only one thing at a time. In my experience, as long as things are contextually separate doing one doesn't really interfere with my ability to do the others. It actually keeps my mind more in the ""personal development"" mindset and can be extra motivating due to the increased progress you make because you spend more time on improving yourself.

For instance: I'd find it relatively easy to work on keeping my house clean, talking to more people and going to the gym. Because at each particular instant of time there's still only (at most) one thing to focus on. This is ideally speaking; in reality things can still overlap but if you pick your priorities well enough that won't happen much."

Of course plenty of people said stuff like ""don't worry about what other people think"", ""be yourself"" etc. but I never internalized them, considering them to be empty platitudes (I may or may not be really stubborn, too).

So I'd like to add to this advice, because ""change your mindset"" was always so abstract to me. I like to think of ""mindset"" as mental habits, which you can train. Concretely, I find that the best approach is to start behave as if your mindset has already been changed and afterwards your mind will follow. When you recognize that a difficult situation is coming up, and you have the time to think it through, do what you think you would be doing with the mindset you want to have, rather than the one of your old mindset. At first that will be tough, because you really have to consciously think through what the best thing to do or say would be. But if you keep doing this, then over time this will go faster until you don't realize it and do it automatically.

Also, negative self-talk you can change by trying to recognize it when it happens as much of possible (the recognizing is a skill you'll have to practice as well) and then coming up with alternative, positive explanations/viewpoints. It will slowly and at first you won't believe the positive explanation and it will seem like a futile exercise. But if you keep doing it, giving it a positive spin will become a mental habit and eventually with every negative thought a positive thought will also appear, which you can consider to be true. Not that you should always accept the positive, feel-good explanation over the negative one, but at least you should consider it."

It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you at all. It says far more about them than it does about you.

There's actually an extra piece of advice hidden in this story: try to have multiple groups of people you want to hang out with. If a remark is only made by one group, the problem is with that group, it's much easier to convince yourself that the problem is not actually with you.

I get your point, although there's a difference in them determining the time frame and them determining the terms. Unless they've made it very clear that they don't want you to contact them at all, I think a simple 'How are you doing, I'm still sorry, do you feel ready to try reconnecting yet?' after a 1-2 years won't hurt too much. It still leaves the ball in their court, it's just a reminder after a year that they have that choice.

I was in a similar situation last year, where I was behaving toxic to a friend and she had enough of it. That moment was a real eye opener for me, and made me realise how shitty I was and that I had to put real effort into working on myself: I quit alcohol, quit my incredibly stressful and unsatisfying job and started exercising regularly.

Half a year later I knew we'd encounter each other again at a mutual friend, so beforehand I asked if she wanted to fix what could be fixed. She declined but also didn't want things to be weird.  We did encounter each other a week later, and a again a week after that. She said she saw how much better I was doing now compared to back then. I wasn't really sure what that meant to how we stood, but last week she invited me to her birthday party.

Point of my story is that they haven't seen the progress you've made, so they still think of you as the person you were when they broke stuff off instead of the person you are now.

Maybe you can try social/team sports? The typical way you get to know new people is regular, unplanned interactions with them, which is why people make friends at school. Doing, say, football every week with the same people satisfies that requirement.

selfimprovement,fed8fly,t1_fe3j7i7,1579003572.0,"It has been at least 5 years ago since I listened to the audio book, and back then I just listened to it without actually applying it, so I might remember some things wrong (or my poor mindset from back then interpreted it wrong). What I remember, though, was that it's mainly about conditional relationships: in his examples he puts effort in his relationship with the other person because he wants something back. I guess that's a fine business wise, but it seems to be a poor recipe for personal relationships, where you shouldn't do things because you want something back.

Am I remembering this wrong and should I read it again or is it indeed the case?"
selfimprovement,fed4enu,t1_fed3e69,1578998294.0,"> The friends that I wish to rekindle are in power of the time frame. Theyâ€™ve made it clear that if they want to rekindle, itâ€™ll be on their terms. So Iâ€™m respecting what they want and just doing my best to leave them be. 

I get your point, although there's a difference in them determining the time frame and them determining the terms. Unless they've made it very clear that they don't want you to contact them at all, I think a simple 'How are you doing, I'm still sorry, do you feel ready to try reconnecting yet?' after a 1-2 years won't hurt too much. It still leaves the ball in their court, it's just a reminder after a year that they have that choice.

I was in a similar situation last year, where I was behaving toxic to a friend and she had enough of it. That moment was a real eye opener for me, and made me realise how shitty I was and that I had to put real effort into working on myself: I quit alcohol, quit my incredibly stressful and unsatisfying job and started exercising regularly.

Half a year later I knew we'd encounter each other again at a mutual friend, so beforehand I asked if she wanted to fix what could be fixed. She declined but also didn't want things to be weird.  We did encounter each other a week later, and a again a week after that. She said she saw how much better I was doing now compared to back then. I wasn't really sure what that meant to how we stood, but last week she invited me to her birthday party.

Point of my story is that they haven't seen the progress you've made, so they still think of you as the person you were when they broke stuff off instead of the person you are now.

*Edit: Of course I don't know much about the situation, so if some advice of mine doesn't make sense, don't do it.*"
selfimprovement,fed37dm,t3_eoir0v,1578996528.0,"It's not easy and will be terribly uncomfortable, but you can always try to get in touch with those former friends. Apologize for your actions while also taking responsibility for them (and actually do that, it's a crucial part of growing up). 

There's no guarantee that they'll agree and if they do they initially might be a bit wary, but if you were friends for a long time you must have had a click and nobody likes to lose a long-time friend, the one who cut it off doesn't like that either. 

Don't treat your friends as a support system. You can tell them what's bothering you if they ask, but don't start unprompted and really grok that you're the only one who can work on whatever problems you have yourself."

Maybe you can try social/team sports? The typical way you get to know new people is regular, unplanned interactions with them, which is why people make friends at school. Doing, say, football every week with the same people satisfies that requirement.

> I become so needy that I get mad at him if he sleeps early and doesn't talk to me. I have become so dependent on him just because I am lonely that now I am scared that he might get pissed at me for doing so. 

Did you talk to him about this? Not in a ""here's my problem, now solve this for me"" kind of way, but like ""this is bothering me and I'm not sure what I can do to make it better"". He knows you and your situation much better than we do."
selfimprovement,fed1x41,t1_fechvev,1578994596.0,"Sounds like you're procrastinating. The first step is to figure out concrete goals you want to achieve, and then work on one goal at a time, don't try to do everything at once (you've got enough time, remember?). We all want to achieve a lot in a short time, but that causes us to overreach, then we fail and give up. 

The long-term perspective is much better: just take a little step every time. It can be really small, it could be to the point that it feels pointless to you. If you keep taking small steps, eventually they will add up to real progress over time."
selfimprovement,fe6rwwo,t1_fe6dov6,1578902516.0,"The biggest thing is that I was always portraying myself ""better"" than I really was, never showing any vulnerability and therefore I never felt close to anyone, not even my parents or best friends. This isn't even dating (with which I still haven't made much progress), it's basic interpersonal relationships.

Second was that I spent my life caring way too much about what others think, despite not even knowing their opinion. This part is closer to ""not giving a fuck"": if you want to do something, don't let others (implicitly) hold you back. And saying what you think instead of what you think others want to hear builds confidence.

One big reason why I have Models and Subtle Art tied is because Models is more focused, which makes it more concrete and easier to apply. Subtle Art is more abstract but when I reread it, my experiences since the last time I read it make it feel like a totally different book."
selfimprovement,fe4yx8r,t1_fe41ahj,1578864130.0,"For me it's a tie between Subtle Art and Models (by the same author). Subtle Art is what I read first, and it really drove the point home that I just wasn't taking responsibility for my own life and just messing about directionless instead.

After that I read Models, which really changed my perspective on confidence and it was crucial in building more genuine and meaningful relationships with others, even people I knew for over a decade."

stopdrinking,fckoo81,t3_ehitcd,1577729879.0,"Definitely, I tried to moderate several times, or to quit for a month, but I never succeeded at that. I finally quit my alcoholic downwards spiral after the umpteenth (particularly) evening where I acted shamefully and messed up something that couldn't be made right again. The next morning I realized I couldn't go on like this, that I had implicitly tried the ""deal with my problems by drinking""-approach long enough to see that it didn't work.

Recently I realized that one important thing, which particularly kept me on track later on, was that I decided that I should start liking myself. I was in a job which did not suit me at all but I felt I had to do it because others wanted me to, I did not maintain my social contacts, never experienced the slightest form of intimacy; subconsciously I hated myself and who I was. Because I hated myself, in a sick sense I liked destroying myself with alcohol and I felt I deserved the outfall of those shitty drunk actions, it definitely explains why I kept/started drinking even when I knew very well I might do stuff I'd regret."

What makes it a bit harder is that I'm not an absolutist, I don't think having one drink would completely negate all of my sobriety.
