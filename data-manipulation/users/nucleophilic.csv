fatlogic,ff594lq,t1_ff2ewfe,1579583950.0,"Shit yeah, I was. Sorry! I was stuck on the ""I'm in a deficit"" part."
fatlogic,ff2cbmz,t1_ff2b80y,1579500502.0,"Yeah, I'm curious as well. Even when you calculate for someone's height being *literally* 8 foot 10 inches and 350 pounds, their basal metabolic rate (BMR) is not over 3200 calories. For someone 6 foot and 200 pounds, their BMR is 2000 calories. My BMR is 1500. I have a really hard time believing that someone's BMR is 3200 calories. Maybe he's a hardcore athlete and runs a ton?"
fatlogic,ff2bptr,t1_ff2atpd,1579499896.0,I'm definitely not an office worker and do not need over 2000 calories a day. I maintain my weight at around 1500 and have a moderately active job. Not everyone is a super tall man/athlete.

bouldering,fdklb4l,t3_elvqz5,1578505908.0,"As a fellow woman climber that climbs about the same grade, I love seeing videos like this on this sub. As much as I like seeing all these great climbers on much higher grades, it's nice to see someone about my level too! Keep up the work! 

I think it probably made it harder when you were trying to figure out your footwork, so what I've been trying to do is go on lower grade routes and messing around with what to do with my legs/feet - going up and then down climbing."

solotravel,fd08s3j,t3_ejrvf9,1578115330.0,"I use an Osprey Farpoint 55. The detachable daybag is for under the seat in front of me in a plane and the big bag goes up top. I've been using it for international and domestic travel for five years and have never had an issue, even for month long trips. 70-90L is huge, dude. But Osprey is a good brand, so maybe see if there's a local store (REI, Moosejaw, etc.) where you can try one on?"
solotravel,fcwq1px,t3_ej6h3o,1578033192.0,"In response to the hostel question: I'm 29 too and I love staying in hostels. You can be as social or as anti-social as you want. There are days I don't talk to anyone. There are days I talk to my roommates (or others in the hostel) and we go on an adventure together or they give recommendations on what to do. There are a ton of other solo-travelers around in hostels. Actually, when I stayed at one in Portland, one of my roommates was 75 - I only met her briefly but she seemed awesome. 

*No one* is judging you, they're too busy with their own lives. Eat by yourself, wander alone if you want, enjoy your travels and where you are at that moment. What you do during your days is completely up to you and it's a huge perk.

For Berlin... I love Berlin. Same with Thailand, though. There's a lot to do there and it's honestly up to you how much time you want to spend in a city. Berlin has a huge night life, museums, places to eat, art scene, etc. I personally like spending more than just 2-3 days in a city, I try to aim for 4-5. But again, it's really up to you and how much you're interested in doing. Whenever I go somewhere, I like to have one or two points of interests chosen and then I fill in the blanks for the rest of the day. I'm usually on a time crunch like you are because us Americans don't get super long vacations. You could always visit Amsterdam, Prague, Paris... there are a ton of places in Europe that you could see on top of Berlin and Budapest if you feel like 16 days is too long to split between the two."
AskReddit,fctkoem,t3_eimxr3,1577946757.0,At midnight I was too busy jumping around after having some sparkling juice to care. Then I threw up. I was 10.
solotravel,fcj3bgr,t1_fci72bp,1577676223.0,"I went to Berlin about 3 years ago and speak only English. I still said things like, ""danke"" and ""guten tag"" but beyond that, I ended up in situations where a bad attempt at German wasn't even needed in the first place. It's a multi-cultural hub in Germany, so plenty of people either don't speak German as well or also speak English."

TwoXChromosomes,fbv1ta5,t1_fbuqhmy,1577124008.0,"There's a difference between not having good coping skills and almost killing your wife. It's a lucky thing she didn't go fully septic and actually *die*. A fever like that, untreated, with little to no immune system in a cancer patient can very easily kill someone. If she had waited another day, I don't doubt that she would've died."
