I think they're are cheaper alternatives out there, I believe his price is greatly inflated because of his nationality. When I say the price is too high, I mean it's too high. I'm sure there'll be a few that'll agree with me, we can't be seen to continually overpay for players.

reddevils,fedzmpf,t1_fedxfot,1579023244.0,"I was alluding to homegrown players also for me in my comment. Mate I couldn't agree more about the fee if it's the right player. The way I look at it is: if you spend 120 mill on the right player, it beats paying 50 million 5 times over for the wrong player. I'm loving this season from Rash and Mason, this is what we've always done and nothing makes me prouder as a United fan. Look at Dean Henderson too, he joined us in 2011 from Carlisle I think, he's going to be England's no1 and also out no1. I'm super excited to see how he gets on.

We also have Hannibal in the academy, Dillon Hoogewerf, Arnau, Charlie Wellens and Shola there too. I think this will probably be one of our greatest pulls from the academy, if we get the squad right in terms of our other recruitment then the next few season could be magic for us, but we need to get the basics right first and I think Ole is laying these foundations in place."

reddevils,fedr1zx,t1_fednf2b,1579018048.0,"We need to be concerned when it comes to spending lad, we need our voices to be heard. In the blink of an eye it could all go pear shaped and we're no longer a financial power house because of overspending. It's a concern we shouldn't let out of our sight. We've spent far too much on shite players. We've had our pants pulled down and asses slapped far too much for my liking. We can't continue to allow this to happen. Just because we have money, we shouldn't spend it on the wrong personnel.

For all of what we've spent I can't see there being much of a difference. Our top goalscorer is an academy lad, one of the players of the season so far has also being an academy lad. We also some promising lads coming up from the academy, in that sense it's exciting but we do need to strengthen that midfield, we also need a world class winger, that's a position that's been crying out to be strengthened for a few seasons now and I thought we'd done it in signing Sanchez, how wrong was I?
