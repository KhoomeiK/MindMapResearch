todayilearned,fdr17jh,t1_fdr04mw,1578678091.0,If you 'forget' you are a top tier moron lol. This is drilled into you during training.
todayilearned,fdr156y,t1_fdqzjly,1578678050.0,"Cabins are pressurised to 6000-8000ft otherwise you'd pass out.

Every 10 meters you descend in the water adds another atm of pressure for you (as you say with 8m being equal to 0.8atm)."
todayilearned,fdqyp4t,t1_fdqyfvy,1578676909.0,Yes. Rule of thumb is 24 hours between end of dive and start of flight.
todayilearned,fdqxu4p,t1_fdqxn8c,1578676384.0,"Anyone doing any dive can get a bend from that dive. Plane or not.

If you haven't been under increased pressure then the pressure differential between the surface of Earth and the pressure in the cabin won't be enough to cause a bend."
todayilearned,fdqt40g,t1_fdqpkzz,1578674304.0,"The thing is that the bends isn't an on/off condition. You can have very mild bends and severe life threatening bends.

The problem is one of compressed nitrogen in solution coming out of solution as your ambient pressure decreases. Every diver will probably have nitrogen bubbles in the blood after a dive, the key is they're small enough to come out of the blood in the lungs and be breathed out. Is this a bend? No, because no adverse effects are present.

Now, he could have a slightly numb finger or something at the surface, which could be a nitrogen bubble pressing against a blood vessel. Is this a bend? Yes, it is, because there's a symptom, but it's only slight.

So to answer your question yes it is just the bends but not in a normal condition, but it doesn't necessarily mean his dive was a dangerous one or that he'd had decompression illness at surface level."
todayilearned,fdqo7sh,t1_fdqnqum,1578671275.0,"Small nitpick but interesting I think. The dude likely didn't have a bend, or had a very very mild bend at surface pressure. However, the depressurisation of the cabin as the plane rose was enough to expand the nitrogen bubbles inside him and cause his symptoms."
AmItheAsshole,fdmvcwe,t1_fdm0sgx,1578567558.0,"You're sort of implying that ownership of the cat comes above the cat's health by suggesting he'd be TA for shaving the cat since it's his wife's cat.

Sorry but the animal had a health need that was being neglected. This is akin to withholding pain medication because it makes your cat's fur go a colour you don't like. Completely unacceptable and totally disrespectful to the autonomy of the animal.

AskReddit,fdgfo92,t1_fdgcujv,1578394646.0,Also Breaking Bad is a neo western so it can also be seen as a call back to sepia tone westerns.
AskReddit,fdger0p,t1_fdelcnb,1578393362.0,It's explained in the EU. The empire has a merit system or something similar based on kills per shot. If he shot the pod and it turns out there was nobody on it then his numbers go down and so does his standing for promotions/pay rises etc.
ukpolitics,fc94aue,t1_fc90y5s,1577546807.0,Almost took the bait.
ukpolitics,fc8sigq,t1_fc873od,1577541188.0,"If you think any sort of responsibility is going to be taken if Brexit goes tits up by the leave lot then you're delusional.

It'll be blamed on ""remoaners"". As it always is."
todayilearned,fc1qe09,t1_fc1pd5u,1577326409.0,That place is literally the dark side cave. There's a story in legends of a young force user going into the cave and being near crippled by the dark side energy there. The force user was terrified of Yoda since he showed no signs of it affecting him.
