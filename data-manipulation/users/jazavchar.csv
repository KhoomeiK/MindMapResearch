gtd,fez0p3k,t1_feyz7yy,1579452824.0,"TickTick is not great at reference material since all it can do is tasks. There's still no way to create a note, so the reference folder is just a bunch of tasks with descriptions. But it has the advantage of being very fast and has a quick add functionality on Android so it's kinda like my first line of defense when a thought pops up in my mind. 

Currently it holds a bunch of general stuff I'd like to remember, like movies to watch, games to play, interesting places to visit, a bunch of checklist templates (travel checklist, weekly review checklist, natural planning model checklist, brainstorming checklists) and the like. 

I'm still debating on a suitable heavy-duty app for my reference files. I'm torn between Google Keep and OneNote. For project support material, I have everything stored on Google Drive. Most projects don't require any project support material, but those that due (most of them work projects) get their own folder (which matches the name of the project in TickTick) with their readme.txt file where I describe my future actions, project plans, brainstorming, etc."

TheMindIlluminated,femf00a,t1_felkr37,1579252048.0,">I don't know where this idea that the DMN produces ah-ha moments comes from.  Or that it's a corollary for intuition.

I am not a neuroscientist. I'm just a guy who's interested in brain training and self-discovery. The idea that DMN produces these moments is my layman's understanding of the workings of the brain. If that understanding is wrong, it's entirely my doing because I probably misunderstood those complex concepts. 

That being said, let me give you a concrete example: most of my ideas and breakthroughs have come about while I was in the shower. It's gotten to the point where I call the shower my ""idea generation box"". I've put a writing pad in there because I just get so many ideas while in there.

But the thing is, I'm not mindful while I'm in the shower. I start off being mindful and then my mind wanders off, I get lost in thought, lose sense of time and the next thing I know, I get out on the other side with an idea, an insight or a better understanding of a new concept. 

Now, had I been mindful of the shower, I would be aware of the water, the soap, the sponge, how the steam feels on my skin, the contact of my feet with the shower floor, etc. I'm not aware of any of those things when I get lost in thought during a shower. And I believe that I would not be having these breakthroughs if I were aware of all those things. Maybe only through more practice. As it currently stands, awareness for me still takes a great deal of my conscious processing power because I have to consciously remember to refocus on the water, on the shower floor, on the sounds. 

What are your thoughts on this?"
TheMindIlluminated,fem7vdf,t1_felbvo7,1579242926.0,"That's very interesting. Would you say it was detrimental to you to aim being mindful as much as you can? That's exactly what I'm afraid of, but lots of people say it's not possible..."

TheMindIlluminated,feks8t5,t1_fekr2jn,1579206533.0,"Thank you for taking the tame to properly clarify all these terms. I very much appreciate it. 

However, I'm a bit confused with this paragraph: 

>E.g.- I notice there is some rushed and anxiety arising in me now, I wonder why this is happening, maybe I'd like to explore that, or consciously try to shift that inner state to something more pleasant or useful, etc.  
>  
> Instead of just feeling rushed/anxious/reacting to that feeling and perpetuating more suffering for yourself and everyone around you.

Shouldn't the point of meditation practice be to accept whatever we're feeling or thinking? Maybe I got it wrong, but I feel like we should never think ""maybe I'd like to try to shift that inner state"".  I accept that I might be wrong on that one. 

Anyway, thank you for reading the post and offering your opinion. As another poster put it elegantly, the trick is in mindful mind wandering a.k.a. being aware that my attention is in a diffuse, broad state. Thanks!"
TheMindIlluminated,fekrdpz,t1_fekq11s,1579206030.0,">So the subtlety that resolves this apparent paradox that you've quite brilliantly identified is that you can indeed mind-wander mindfully.

Thank you so much for this beautiful insight. That, indeed, seems to be the answer. And all those books on human brain do make a distinction between helpful and unhelpful mind wandering. Rumination, negative thinking and anxiety are never helpful for solving complex problems or learning difficult topics. 

And after I wrote this post, I also realized that the recommend way to properly utilize diffuse thinking is to enjoy yourself doing another relaxing and pleasant activity, not stressing out or being anxious (bad mind wandering). 

So yes, the key is to mind wander mindfully! What an elegant solution!"

To clarify a bit on my previous comment for the benefit of other readers; I had that child's sense of wonder and could much easily get lost in a book because I love(d) reading and all the books where new to me. It was not ADHD hyper-focus. And of course, reading for hours was much easier with a good book that I liked, then with a boring book. If the book was a drag I would also struggle to maintain attention while reading it. That's normal. 

But now, no matter how interesting a book may be, I still find my brain switching focus almost by default, around every 12 minutes. I also hear and feel phantom vibrations and dings from notifications. We're so used to the constant dopamine rush from our little slot-machines that we are truly on a path to completely shattering our attention spans. And I'm only 31. Imagine what this does to younger brains."

And internet with social media, notifications, messages, pings, dings, reddit, never-ending scroll ect. 

I do not have ADHD. As a kid I could sit down and read a book for 3-4 hours straight without even looking up. I'd get neck pain from sitting in the same position for hours and getting lost in the book. Nowdays, I've actually timed myself. I can sustain attention for exactly 12 minutes before my mind goes ""oh hey, let's go check our phone"". I've learned to guide it back to the task at hand thanks to meditation, but before that, I'd just go and use my phone. 

Sucks."
getdisciplined,fe385s9,t1_fe1ogqx,1578846877.0,"Thank you! These are very profound questions, and give me much to think about.

Just a little clarification. I'm not from the US and our culture is a bit different from the ""go-getter"" culture of the US. Our culture loves to theorize and criticize and we're scared of making decisions because the fear of failure is very strong. All in all, this creates a culture where not much gets done, and where maintaining the status quo is paramount due to the fear of ridicule and criticism.

I do have to admit that my co-worker is a smart, competent guy. I cannot take that away from him. We're actually in the same department and collaborate on the majority of projects. It's just that I have this ""doer"" mentality that's a lot closer to the US mentality than our native ""thinker"" mentality. This might explain some of his tendencies. However, he is definitely a perfectionist because he'll spend 15 minutes adjusting line spacing in a simple, quick update e-mail to the rest of the team. This drives me crazy.

But you're right, he his very predictable and consistent. His perfectionism has been noticed by the higher-ups but so far has not caused any major problems (projects and deliverables being late) and that's why I believe it has not been directly addressed. I also tend to speed him up if we're working together on something. There were a few instances where he tried to discourage me from taking action because he thought it was impossible. I went and did it anyway and was successful. This, however, tends to be forgotten, and he is very smart not mention those instances where he was wrong and passive.

All in all, it's a very nuanced topic. I will most definitely take to heart your questions and try to work through them. For now, I'm trying to work on myself and not be paralyzed by fear as I believe only through experience and doing can we get better. I do not like our culture of just sitting around and maintaining the status quo, I like going out and doing things even if it makes me fail. It's just that his way of doing things so far has also been successful and he has advanced at an almost equal rate and that got me thinking.

Bottom line is that, he has a very fixed mindset while I always try to improve and advance my career, yet I have not gone any further than him. I might just be impatient though :D"
getdisciplined,fe1b15h,t3_enk8il,1578824540.0,"This is an excellent piece with some profound insights. Thanks OP for taking the time to write and post this.

I do have one question, however. I have a co-worker who's the literal definition of a perfectionist. Writing a simple email consisting of two paragraphs of information is a 3 hour affair for him. He is very risk averse and almost never leaves his comfort zone. Hell, he even dislikes using new words, opting instead to always repeat the same phrases and idioms.

Yet, he seems to be doing well and advancing in his career. He never takes any risks and does not put himself out there but seems to be advancing well enough, especially in relation to me. 

What could be the explanation for this? Could it be that I'm simply not seeing the situation clearly enough and have my ego clouding my judgement?"
