So now there is a tiny nebula of gasses made up mostly of O2 and H, with metal bits careening through the void, striking each other at high speed. A spark, a flame from something still working, etc. Poof. Fireball in space.

Granted, it would be short-lived.

Worst case scenario. A puncture in the tank could also ignite if the trail of gas came into contact with the thrusters' jet flame."

Dude kills a bunch of people, but the police fuck up when they arrest him or collect evidence or whatever else and because of that, they walk? Just because they decide to follow the strict letter of the law does not mean justice has been served.
