I am moving past your actions and the way they have affected me. Whether or not you join me is up to your future actions and the risk/value I consider a relationship with you to have."" Its letting go, but not carelessly forgetting."

It also just feels.... like something I deserve to live with because of past mistakes in my youth."
happy,fdodqpj,t1_fdnmw9g,1578603262.0,"I desperately need 3-4 implants, one has actually become somewhat of a major health risk (literally so painful that my vision blurs, and nothing shy of 100proof mouthwash will stop it) but dental implant work is so frigging expensive. Too bad i can't claim that it is legitimate outside of dental insurrance"

todayilearned,fctpnoj,t1_fctaru8,1577953110.0,"I'm inherently private when it comes to things that are ""mine"" but aren't tangible in nature, so this rubs me the wrong way. I think if it was instead implimented in a more socialist economy, one where issues are more ""our poor"" than ""the poor"", then it wouldn't feel so unsettling to me. I think I could live with it though, especially in a smaller population where things were closer to home."
