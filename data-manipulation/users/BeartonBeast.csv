I would like to keep change in my pocket though, as well. Everything is too costly once you give workers a fair wage, because everyone else is getting paid poorly, and then can only buy poorly. You would have to uproot the entire capitalistic system and make sure management is closely monitored and profits distributed evenly amongst  workers, otherwise the price is just driven up in an attempt to get the CEO his christmas bonus back. 

Socialism sucks though, as many thought experiments have concluded in my experience. So does the complete opposite though, where people are left to fend for themselves in a corporate-controlled economy, where any chance at change or success is squashed by legal bullshit, or lack of unions.
