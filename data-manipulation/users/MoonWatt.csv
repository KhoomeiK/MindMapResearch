BPD,ffhv1g6,t3_etlni7,1579955230.0,"I saw a post yesterday, from someone, challenging us to admit that people around us have let us down, not all but some and I think it results in depression when it’s people close to you. I’ve had 2 friends exactly like that. Worse, when they had issues, they would literally just show up on my door step. I remember when I finally confronted my ex best friend (after my late sis). I had just given birth after losing my sister, 3 months earlier, who was my everything  (she didn’t come to the funeral). She just showed up on my door step, after she got stood up for a date.   


She still refused to listen to me. She just ghosted me. That was trauma in itself. The other one was my ex boyfriend. He dumped me, straight After my sisters funeral, because instead of giving him attention, I had apparently been preoccupied spending time with my sister who passed away 3 moths after giving birth. They found stomach cancer 2 days after she gave birth, she was 32.

Sorry for the long comment, I want you to know I understand and those people are shitty people and more importantly, I somehow made it out of that unimaginable time. People like that usually just can’t stand when something is NOT about them and they are usually full of drama.   


I am so sorry."
BPD,ffhucyn,t3_etptdr,1579954321.0,I don’t know if it’s selfish. But I think you’re setting yourself up for disappointment and your boyfriend and best Friend up for failure. That is a very small support base... Tiny.
depression,ffht30g,t3_etmlz0,1579952487.0,"My problem comes when the very same people who tell you it’s selfish dismiss your pain. So basically a person living a live of torture must just grin and bear it in silence just to keep the happy people happy? I believe that it depends. killing Yourself because of something that can change, is to me funny. Not selfish, just funny cause it could still change. But living with a mind that feels like it is rotting, when you would give anything to think like other people. When you have tried everything and people around you seem tired... I would not be that friend or sister to Make you feel like you owe it to me to suffer just so I my happiness won’t be threatened.   


At the end, my life was given to me. And your life was given to you. Nothing in this world gives me the right to tell you how to feel."
