>Wetterhahn would recall that she had spilled one or two drops of dimethylmercury from the tip of a pipette onto her latex-gloved hand. Not believing herself in any immediate danger, as she was taking all recommended precautions, she proceeded to clean up the area prior to removing her protective clothing.However, tests later revealed that dimethylmercury can, in fact, rapidly permeate different kinds of latex gloves and enter the skin within about 15 seconds. The exposure was later confirmed by hair testing, which showed a dramatic jump in mercury levels 17 days after the initial accident, peaking at 39 days, followed by a gradual decline.

>Despite aggressive chelation therapy, her condition rapidly deteriorated. Three weeks after the first neurological symptoms appeared, Wetterhahn lapsed into what appeared to be a vegetative state punctuated by periods of extreme agitation. One of her former students said that ""Her husband saw tears rolling down her face. I asked if she was in pain. The doctors said it didn't appear that her brain could even register pain.""

* Luke got absorbed into the Force and is no longer corporeal anywhere but the island.

* Luke was gravely injured in his first confrontation with Snoke, and depends on the island keeping him alive.

* (My favourite one) Luke no longer cares. He's seen the whole history of the Republic, rising and falling and rising and falling, and has concluded that no matter what you do, all of your work will be washed away like drawings on sand, so what's the point? Everything is a cycle, everything is balanced and cancels out. Make a thousand generation era of peace and harmony today, lose it to a thousand year era of oppression and torture tomorrow. The first part of the movie is Rey trying to convince him he's wrong, and in doing so acting out the arguments fans have been having for decades about the nature of balance and if the Dark Side can be used responsibly."

Every single one before they bought it was about the Skywalker family, and had one as the main character. Of *course* making the last Skywalker alive into a bitter old hermit who allowed the galaxy to fall into fascism, *again*, because he was too depressed to help and flatly refused to help anyone afterwards either, pissed fans off."
