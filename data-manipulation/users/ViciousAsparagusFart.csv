AmItheAsshole,ffu3zq8,t3_ev5ru5,1580233999.0,"NTA, I had to pull this one out on my bosses who were inquiring why me and my girlfriend were not advancing our relationship 4 years in. I said:

A. We are waiting until we can afford to get married, buy a house (read: give me a raise and I’ll do it)

B. Unfortunately, we found out recently that we are infertile. (Read: Don’t you feel like a dick now?)

We don’t plan on having kids. And now anyone at the office who owns thinks differently can find out they are insensitive assholes when they inquire."

The key is to do the Vampire quest line, become a vampire but then cure yourself and turn on them at the end. You get the Ring of the Beast when you finish off Serena’s Dad. After that you enchant your future gauntlets with fortified unarmed skill and you become an absolute behemoth albeit with slightly limited melee range. 3-4 right hooks and a Drauger death lord is toast.
