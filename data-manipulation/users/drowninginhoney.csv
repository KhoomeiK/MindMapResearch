When things are finally over, you can miss the good aspects you had with someone, but it doesn’t mean you should get back together. Divorce can really bring out the worst in people, even when they never wanted it to get bad. They’re trying to look out for their own self interest and it gets messy. Lawyers are looking out for themselves. They were fighting over custody. It gets messy. You want the best for you. You want what you think is best for your child, which you hope is you. It’s tough."

I’ve just had a lot of bad happen over the last year, and seeing that accident really put it into perspective. Thanks for taking time to comment. I appreciate it."
