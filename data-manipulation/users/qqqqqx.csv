That was when we were hosting a house show and a random metal band from out of town was playing in our living room. Also I was on a lot of acid and tequila and had badly played a set of 90s TV and movie theme covers earlier that night. And also I invited everyone from my literature 101 group project to my house to discuss the zine we were making as our final project, about 15 of them had showed up and discussed our project around a fire pit in the back yard while I was tripping balls with my face painted up for our performance. 

Good times."

Obviously he doesn't prefer to play that supportive style, he likes to have higher dps, but that's exactly why they are putting him on different champs to expand his comfort zone and open up new potential playstyles and drafts for TL as a whole."
leagueoflegends,fh1s61s,t1_fh0s824,1581222619.0,I think he picked it on purpose because it isn't his usual style but he wants to learn it so his team can be comfortable and confident playing any style necessary for international results. Of course he will be better on his bread and butter carry champs but I respect that he is trying to practice outside his comfort zone. I'm sure the coaches / team are well aware of his dislike for senna and his skill level at her but after winning so many splits in a row they are more focused on improvement than regular season results (especially with the way this split hardly matters for worlds qualifications)

How did I learn to put on a good performance with my band and not feel anxious about it? I did years of godawful performances growing up and got the big mistakes out of the way.

How did I get to be a decent chess player? I lost thousands of games and eventually started to recognize certain patterns as good or bad.

Nobody paints the Mona Lisa on their first try. Beginners in anything often have a mental gap between what they can actually do and what they want to do, but the only way to bridge that gap is to keep trying even when their output isn't as polished as they hoped."
leagueoflegends,fgem7z6,t1_fgaex5h,1580703040.0,"Memories, for a while my favorite champ was soraka mid rylais first. I would just spam Q running around team fights slowing everyone and stacking the MR debuff. Then some pro player did it and it got immediately nerfed after being on stage. I loved the old raka build, infusing mana into yourself or your teammates was awesome. No other champ has ever been able to offer mana to an ally I think."
politics,fg5cqyy,t1_fg5cewt,1580524046.0,"If you have a fucking backbone you always have a choice of how to vote. Bernie breaks from democratic lines constantly and he is doing phenomenally for himself (not only a very successful multi term congress member but even a decent shot at presidential candidate from inside a party that wants to keep him down). John McCain broke party lines on Healthcare and other issues and he did fine, was arguably more respected than many of his conservative peers because he was willing to use his brain instead of following mitch. Republicans are almost all crooked. So are democrats but they aren't as militant about holding the party line, which is why the right has had so much control the last few years over the courts."
leagueoflegends,fg05op9,t1_fg00ge1,1580400776.0,"I do love roaming as support. Even if my adc is good I try to take over the whole bottom half of the map by warding aggressively around drag and enemy jungle, buying mobis, and running to fight with jungle or mid whenever something is going down.
Again the only sad part is when you're snowballing someone who isn't very good and can't make use of the advantages you created."
leagueoflegends,ffym9i8,t1_ffyinm4,1580349786.0,"Support has the most laning agency in the early game but that influence falls off hard as other roles outscale you.
As a support main I can't tell you how frustrating it is to smash early / hook up your adc with a ton of kills and then not have enough damage to carry late while you watch the adc throw."
leagueoflegends,ffylswk,t1_ffwl0cu,1580349473.0,"I kinda disagree. In lower elos people don't know how to lose gracefully and sometimes end up feeding super hard, and it can be tough to get people together to save towers or contest major objectives. I think if you want to climb out of lower ELO you should pick someone you are confident you can win lane against a weaker opponent with and look to snowball.
I do think some champions fall off too hard and can be hard to climb with, and if you aren't confident in yourself it can be better to pick a hard scaler and focus on playing safe until you scale. But if you really want to climb out of low Elo you want a pick with high agency so you can influence the game as hard as possible and carry your teammates."
worldnews,ff41e9m,t1_ff3n9f8,1579553433.0,"I switched into tech (software development) from having an English degree and working as a substitute teacher, mainly for financial reasons.

ProgrammerHumor,ff3ixqn,t1_ff2p5gb,1579542028.0,"You fucked up dog, I make 100k a year and live amazingly comfortably in the bay area. I used to live on minimum wage here and that was rough, but if you're making that kind of money and living paycheck to paycheck you are absolutely messing up and need to learn to budget properly. Who spends 500 a month on bart tickets and still pays 2500 in rent? Either pay a lot and rent closer to work, or commute and pay way less in rent. You shouldn't be doing both.  But even if you did on 120k salary after completely paying off rent transportation and utilities you would still have so much money left over every month to live on and enjoy life with. 

I did a bootcamp income share tuition where I owed 2800 to them every month for my first year of work.  I did fine living comfortably through that (while paying rent, eating well, buying furniture / bikes / whatever I needed) and now I save an assload all the time. You don't pay 50% in taxes, more like 25% at most.  

You're either being dishonest in your comment or you are absolutely terrible with money.  The fact that you claim to have been frugal or careful but also have no idea how much certain things cost you could be either one. But trust me when I was living frugally I was fully aware of every dollar spent. You must have been comfortable to have no idea about some of this stuff."
ProgrammerHumor,ff3hvyg,t1_ff2m9l8,1579541382.0,"Tbh I make 100k in the valley area and I live extremely comfortably. People overestimate the cost of living differences. They mattered a lot when I was making 20k a year minimum wage, but not so much on the software salary"
ProgrammerHumor,ff3heyv,t1_ff2sk9h,1579541092.0,If you contribute legitimately to open source stuff you could probably easily pick up a high paid dev job here. When I was interviewing for my first software role I was asked many times if I had contributed to open source or if I could show off ways I had added to a codebase that wasn't my own project.
ProgrammerHumor,ff3gnjh,t1_ff2sv8h,1579540642.0,"Those people are assholes tbh. I have lived in the sf bay area nearly my whole life. I would complain about cost of living when I was making minimum wage at a grocery store or slightly higher as a substitute teacher... now that I am pulling about 100k as a developer I feel like I'm a goddamn king. I still wish it was more affordable so that my old coworkers and less fortunate friends could be more comfortable and secure, I remember how it felt looking for a rental on 20k a year, but I have zero problems living a great lifestyle on my current salary.  Maybe it's because I made less money in the past so I naturally don't spend huge amounts and am content with an older car / cheaper room / not eating fancy meals every day, as well as having no kids currently, but let's be real 100k is a shit load of money for anyone to be making even in an area where things are more expensive than average."
wholesomememes,ff278fx,t1_ff0tmqr,1579495803.0,"I almost teared up at how real this was to me.  Had to move back in with my parents for financial reasons, just moved back out like two weeks ago. I keep catching myself worrying about things that would upset my father, like last night I was sitting in my room stressing about wanting to use the bathroom at night, and then realizing that my new roommates probably don't care when I use the bathroom and that was just some fucked up shit from my family. Sometimes I don't even realize when I am doing it until way later (and probably sometimes I don't realize at all tbh)."
patientgamers,ff1ynlh,t3_eqwf9a,1579489212.0,"I love competitive games even when I'm not the best at them.  I do well though at not tilting myself during a tough game and not stressing if I lose, but I think I learned that from just doing lots of competitive activities over the years.  I used to play chess a lot and that may have helped me develop healthy mindsets about improvement or accepting defeat.

It may be that competitive gameplay simply isn't your style and that is totally okay.  Many competitive games have more casual game modes that you might enjoy, or unranked play if you have anxieties related to your ranking (counterstrike for example has casual, demolition, gungame, etc).

If you specifically want to improve at something there are a lot of ways to do so but ultimately they all boil down to spending time on focused improvement.  If you want to get good at chess you will need to play a lot of games of chess (and lose a lot of them too).  You might make faster improvements by doing things like studying from books or videos, going over game records after you lose to try and see where they went wrong, etc. but ultimately you will still need to play out a lot of losing positions to get better.  Maybe you can try to focus on playing to improve instead of playing to win.  Like if you go into the game thinking ""Ok, my goal for this game is to practice X good habit or avoid Y mistake"" and then focus your play on learning those specific things (maybe it's better positioning, playing safer, going for pistol kills, idk whatever you have diagnosed as something you could improve on) instead of focusing on the results you are getting you might have a better time."
SeenElsewhere,ff0b0c5,t1_ff04e2x,1579467038.0,"Hard disagree.  Skateboarding is a self expression and an art form and everyone has a different style and approach to it.  Some skaters are beautifully graceful and look almost like ballet dancers or gymnasts, others prefer a looser style, or a more aggressive style, etc.  If you enjoy ""grace"" and only want to see those types of skateboarding they are out there.  Check out some older flat ground skaters like Rodney Mullen, they can look connected with their boards on a near spiritual level and do spins like professional dancers. 

If you went to an art museum and looked only at Jackson Pollock (and assuming you weren't a fan of his style) you might dismiss all paintings as messy or overly abstract, but in fact many other painters are masters of photo realistic portraiture or clean minimalism.  The same holds true for skateboarding. And even if you don't like Jackson Pollock's style you might be able to concede that his work holds some artistic merit, just as skateboarders who have a less graceful style can still be impressive to watch."
webdev,fe6i3te,t3_env1ne,1578891602.0,"Tbh there's no real wrong answer they are all opinionated.  If you're front end already then sticking with Javascript is pretty reasonable so I'd go for node / express since you can more quickly get into backend topics with a language you are already very comfortable with. If you want to learn a new language I would start with an mvc framework using ruby on rails or python/django since they provide an easy to follow established pattern that will accelerate your learning process. Java is never out of style in terms of career opportunities but you may find it saturated with more experienced developers. PHP is still in heavy use by many companies and wouldn't be wrong to learn but I would agree that recent trends are moving away from it for newer companies (and it has some occasionally annoying quirks and weird syntaxes).  
There are plenty of other choices but many are a lot more niche and maybe not the best first choice; my current company uses Go on the backend and while it's not unheard of its also definitely not the norm.  Generally the language isn't that important and if you learn the major concepts of how backends work especially using commom design patterns like Rest or Mvc you should be able to pivot languages easily enough."
webdev,fe6h6tc,t3_enwyx5,1578890785.0,"I think you should style it yourself if you've never done so before. Beginners often reach for a tool or library like bootstrap too early before they've shored up their fundamentals and in the long run this leads to more confusion down the line than if you did a more logical progression from your own styling practice, learning css basics, and then adding a library later."
webdev,fe54ovw,t3_enttfv,1578865625.0,"Bring the resume to one page, maybe remove education if all you have is highschool and ""self taught"", change your work history to show more specific actions and outcomes (most of your bullet points are filler or vague. I want to know what exactly you did, how you did it, and what the outcome was. Things like ""worked for major clients"" doesn't tell me anything about what you do). Take out negative words like basic or average. Remove the organization section, not only is it unnecessary it is extremely vague especially the project manager portion. Remove communication section, you could maybe put that in the cover letter but not on the resume.

For the cover letter I would make it much shorter and more to the point with less boilerplate. Don't copy paste bullet points from the job description. They know what they are looking for. Say what you bring to the table, and use specific experience instead of just saying you have used something give an example of a prior job you did with those tools or related tools and how those skills will be relevant to your new position. Take out Fluff about being challenged or learning new things. If you are applying solely for remote positions you can keep the part about having experience working remotely since that is relevant and a skill but keep it short and don't double it on the resume."
leagueoflegends,fdtwlvh,t1_fdrr40n,1578723395.0,"I actually love coding front end on stuff our designer made.  We use zeplin.io for mockups and its pretty nice since I can see the pixel distance between any two elements and it even gives css suggestions (although they tend to need tweaking).

As far as this specific design I have to say I really liked the ""prototype"" better than the final design that looks more like the current client.  The greyscale background and interface made the chromas much more readable and easier to focus on individually.  The colors really pop against the grey too."
