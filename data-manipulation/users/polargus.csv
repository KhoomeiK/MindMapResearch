PoliticalHumor,fg7oz43,t1_fg73knk,1580597847.0,">	The power we are talking about is international influence so the in country censorship doesn’t really effect that.

Censorship affects their ability to generate media for consumption abroad. No one cares about Chinese media except for the Chinese (and even then some don’t care about it). Why are South Korean and Japanese media so much more popular globally despite their much lower populations? Why are they so popular even in China for that matter? The reverse certainly isn’t true.

An obvious indicator that this is a factor is that once Hong Kong was taken over by communist China its movie industry basically collapsed. Gone are the days of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Chow Yun Fat, John Woo, etc. We’re talking about an industry that produced cinematic legends, household names, that just disappeared. Why are there no new world-famous Chinese stars when their population is so much bigger than Hong Kong’s?

>	Their soft power is extremely powerful, just look at the inaction of the international community in response to Tibet and Uighurs.

In terms of internal affairs yes they can basically do whatever they want. But so can any somewhat powerful country. Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc all do terrible things to their own people and no one lifts a finger.

They can buy out African countries and Pakistan, that’s most of their power. Their soft power is really weak due to their censorship and authoritarianism (Korean media is much more popular and their population is a fraction of China’s).

Keep in mind that speed and distance indoors generally don’t mean anything in terms of an actual workout. If you increase the resistance on your trainer (simulating going uphill) it’ll show that you went less distance but you may have actually worked out harder.
