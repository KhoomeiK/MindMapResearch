college,ffkgcev,t3_eu2ojm,1580022306.0,"I would talk to your professor/lecturer about this. I am taking an intro language undergraduate class (I am a graduate student) and the book cost me $25. 

Honestly, for an intro class that students may be taking for requirement purposes and nothing else, there is really no need to make students pay $200. That is extreme. I would ask the lecturer for his/her reasoning picking such an expensive textbook suite. I may also make a case with the department head over this if you don't get a satisfactory answer out of the professor/lecturer. That does seem REALLY expensive for an intro language class. 

And I can't imagine an actual reason why a prof would need you to literally bring a hard copy of the book if you have it electronically. Worst case scenario you can have it up on your laptop/phone/tablet and hand-write out the necessary work."

Of course, this was at our own risk, but it was there and it was free. I never left anything actually valuable there, but general dorm stuff was just fine. 

If this hadn't existed, I'd probably just go in on a storage locker over the summer with others who were in the same situation. I went to a college where the majority of the population was from out-of-state, so this would not have been hard."

I would say that the degree would be worth it if it is what you would like to go into and you have done research on the jobs you want and see that an MA in Security is listed as a requirement. If so, then, yes, it's worth it. If no, then, no, not worth it."

college,ffk0pev,t3_eu0wz7,1580012248.0,"If you have a dog, you're not going to be able to live in the dorms unless you qualify for a service dog/support dog exemption. None of the dorms at my university allow non-service dogs (though some of the apartments do allow cats). It is also highly unlikely that a roommate would want to share a room with you and your cattle dog. Dorm rooms are small to begin with. 

So as for the dog, you will need to live off-campus, very likely. And your dog would probably not want to live in a dorm anyway. Cattle dogs need more space than that. I think the issue with your dog trumps the issue of your age... which wouldn't be that big of a deal; it's not like you are in your thirties.  

As for being super anti-debt, I would be realistic about this. How much money are you going to be able to make in a year? How much money does tuition cost at your university? What is the difference between tuition and your projected earnings? How much is cost-of-living in your area? How much does it cost to take care of yourself and your dog? 

Are you going to be able to make enough money to do an undergraduate degree at a 4-year university with zero debt? This seems like a very tall order to me, financially, even if you do it at a less-than-full-time rate. 

In terms of classes, it can be challenging since undergraduate classes tend to take place between the hours of 8-5. You may want to look into working nights. You may also want to factor in the cost of pet-sitting to let your dog out during the day. You are going to be very busy.

Like, graduate students can teach undergraduate students due to the degree of separation. PhDs can teach graduate students (and by extension graduate students) due to the degree of separation. 

So... at least at my university, you would be unable to be a TA. You do not have the degree of separation between yourself and your undergraduate peers.

college,ffjjt4h,t3_etyrb4,1579999838.0,"A lot of this depends on your campus culture. Frats can indeed be a great source of parties for some places, but the university I am at has the frats in a party ban due to a string of rapes a few years back. So having connections to frats wouldn't help you much, here. Additionally, I live on campus in an apartment (graduate student), and the campus is deader than a doornail on weekends. This isn't a commuter university specifically, but well over 2/3rds of the population commutes, so... yeah. There is really no overarching party life to speak of, here. 

Your best bet is going to be to get involved in some sort of clubs or groups. They could be sports clubs, they could be esports clubs, they could be political clubs... whatever. Most of the time clubs will also have some sort of social life attached to them and many of them will at least have private gatherings. Your school may simply not have a huge party culture.

At least where I am in the US (and I think that this is a pretty common rule in the US) it is not OK for academic peers to teach peers. That is, if you do not have an undergraduate degree, you cannot teach undergraduate classes, and a TA is a teaching position. Graduate students can teach undergraduate classes since there is at least a degree of separation. PhDs can teach graduate students since there is a degree of situation. 

In most instances that I am aware, TAs work with undergraduate students since they are either master's candidates or PhD candidates and thus already have an undergraduate degree completed.

I have a feeling he would have been a nasty piece of work throughout the process, too.

My600lbLife,ffby2wk,t3_esgz2n,1579786444.0,"The people on this show are self-selecting. It is highly likely that many of them *choose* to be on the show because there's no other realistic way they could afford the kind of medical care that Dr. Now provides. Plenty of them are on Medicaid, and while Medicaid coverage is reasonably comprehensive, it doesn't involve bariatric surgery. 

Basically, somebody who has the money to cover Dr. Now's assistance probably isn't going to be on this show. Why would they shower naked in front of TLC if they didn't ""have"" to do it for money and medical care? You do get the occasional attention whore (a.ka., Steven Assanti), but most of the people on the show aren't like that. (There is a pointed statement in there about the state of medical care in the US, but I'll leave it for now.) 

I think a lot of these individuals are born into rather dire situations. In their backstories, many of them mention poverty, sexual abuse, abandonment, etc. So, various forms of instability that lead them to choose food as a coping mechanism, seemingly largely because it was a constant. 

So I think that poverty *can* be a contributing factor, since living in poverty often correlates to negative health conditions of all sorts, not just obesity.

2. The difference between a ""69.909%"" and a ""70%"" is pretty semantic. The main thing that the prof needs to ensure is that you are at least academically *capable* of continuing on to the next level of classes, which is what getting a C is proof of. Usually profs have cutoff points at some level, but if you were showing effort in the class and just performing very poorly on the tests, it is possible that you got rewarded for your obvious efforts with a bump."

The $30k per year price tag of most colleges does include this cost. At most state universities, at least, the tuition by itself is generally less than $20k and the rest of that is room/board. 

And typically you are not allowed to bring the food back to your dorm, largely because they don't want to have to worry about potential spoilage or health-hazards related to doing that. It's not uncommon for undergraduate dorms to be... less-than-clean, frankly. But it's not like it's difficult to bring back things like fruit, or sealed snacks/cereal cups, grab-and-go sandwiches, or even full meals if you have the forethought to bring tupperware. It's not like a TSA check to get in/out of a dining hall.

Professors generally *really* don't like to give exceptions for exams. This is because it can be difficult to control cheating... if you take it first, there's a chance that you could tell somebody exactly what was on the exam, and if you take it second somebody could tell *you* about it. Making an exam especially for you is a pain in the butt. While your situation is understandable, it's also not your professor's problem that you have a wedding to attend that is out of the country and during exams. 

Again, it doesn't hurt to ask. You won't lose anything by asking.

Students lie about deaths in the family *all of the damn time* to professors. Particularly if you just disappeared without a trace and then showed up afterward and pleaded a dead family member. This is *so common* that it's called ""dead grandmother syndrome."" It is literally a trope in academia. There are jokes about how 8am classes produce more dead grandmothers than 3pm classes. 

I am not accusing you of lying here. However, so many of your fellow students have lied that it's a classic case of the boy who cried wolf. So one of the big takeaways here is: *in the event that you have an actual emergency and have to miss class, notify your professors as early as possible and over-document*. 

If you have an issue, don't just disappear. That gets you into trouble. In the case of dead family members, there is often some form of proof that can be furnished. At the most morbid, death certificates. Otherwise, obituaries, funeral programs, etc. A reasonable professor is not going to fail you over a family member actually dying. The problem was likely that the prof in question didn't believe you. And if you had presented proof, frankly, you could have gone over the prof's head to the head of department, or even to the dean. A school is not going to fail a student over a family member actually dying if the student has proof and you only missed two classes over it. It's just that it's such a common lie. So keep this in mind.

If you want to live off the land, do it proper and go live by yourself in a cabin somewhere as per Ted Kaczynski, but hopefully minus the terrorism bit (otherwise you then get complimentary housing at ADX Florence). But if Kaczynski hadn't been crazy enough to do that Unabomber nonsense, he'd probably still be living his Emersonian wet dream and nobody would give a shit. Because he would be living in the middle of the woods and bothering nobody. 

Mooching off of a homeless slum next to a bike trail should not be encouraged. Bicycle Dave either needs to integrate into non-slum society or get the hell out and live in the woods. He's doing halvsies at the moment and that's a problem. At least from the reading of this, it seems like Bicycle Dave is otherwise a normal dude. 

Nebraskan meth lady seems to hint at way deeper problems.

Having actual work experience is going to be more valuable than yet another internship as a post-grad. 

It is highly unlikely that your first job out of college, whatever it is, is going to be your dream job. But if this is something that pays well and is at least in your targeted field, it could be worth considering. Obviously, if it's going to wreak havoc with your mental health or something, don't do it, but if your issue is ""not being challenged enough,"" that's probably an issue you'll get at most positions directly post-graduation unless you are working with startups, and then you'll have to deal with not getting paid while working 80+ hour weeks, potentially."

In terms of raising your GPA, the obvious solution is to do well in your classes. It's difficult to give pointed advice here without knowing what your particular barriers are to high grades. 

Frankly, if you are concerned about GPA, I would not take any classes P/NP and instead work on getting high grades in all of the classes you are taking.

In terms of getting grants, that's a very complex subject.  Grants are typically given out by private colleges, not by public ones. The best way to get grants is to apply for the FAFSA and then the college will determine your financial aid based on your financial situation. It is much more likely that you will receive government loans rather than grants, however. 

Given that you don't have a very strong academic background (like, a 4.0 and high-level SATs and the like), it is unlikely that you will be applying for any sort of school that is going to be able to give you a large amount of grants. (Yes, low-income students do get grants, but those tend to be low-income students who have strangely-strong academic backgrounds in the face of their hardships and are eligible to get into Harvard. Harvard will give these people money.) In terms of saving money, the best bet is likely going to be to go to a community college for the first 2 years, do well in those classes, and then apply to a local state college. You may be eligible for certain scholarships if you do this and your CC will know about them and help you apply. But I do not think you will get grants.

Though, honestly, if she's going to avoid talking to male professors as per another comment you have made, I don't think that she should be in school. The university can't guarantee her all female professors. And if she isn't going to *talk* to male professors, that's going to a) put her at serious disadvantage, and b) potentially make her unteachable.

It wouldn't be fair to the rest of the class who'd been there the entire time. 

In sum: it *does* sound like you are blaming other people for this.

If you did well in school, you will have a good shot at this sort of program. They take care of your expenses and you can put college loans on deferment when you are doing this. 

If what you really want is a regular job, I would try applying to internships first. Most people I know who were hired straight out of undergrad were interns at the place they got hired.

However, bad grades =/= you are a bad person. Don't value them that way. Grades have no bearing on moral character. You just simply aren't doing enough to excel in the class. That's all. This can be fixed. There is some sort of barrier that is preventing you from academic success.

I lived in a dorm all 3 years I was on campus (the 4th I was abroad) and nobody ever locked their doors. I was heavily involved in a sports team that was very competitive and loved it. I also had a job, volunteered, and enjoyed a good amount of popularity. 

Academically, I really liked my professors, did reasonably well with grades (I left with a 3.6), and decided to write an undergraduate thesis on a subject I found really interesting. This gave me a ""mini-dissertation"" experience which I liked. 

I do feel a good amount of nostalgia for that period of time, but I graduated about 10 years ago and am happy to leave it where it is, in the past. I am currently pursuing a master's degree. I am also very glad that I waited those 10 years to continue my education as I gained a lot of invaluable experience throughout my 20s, and as a result I am absolutely crushing my master's degree. I have a 4.0, the degree is fully-funded, and I'm looking at presenting and potentially publishing as a second-semester student."
college,fd3pyui,t3_ejzk5w,1578160658.0,"There are a couple of reasons for this. 

1) Group work is going to be a part of your future career, no matter what you end up doing. 

2) It is less work for a professor to grade 5 group projects as compared to 30 individual projects. 

Before you ask for an individual project, I'd really look at the nature of the project. With many group projects, you will be at a considerable disadvantage if you try to complete them alone. I also saw in another comment that you were referencing that previous classes only had participation requirements: you're moving along in your major. The classes are going to naturally get more demanding as you go. 

My main advice with group projects is not to expend too much emotional energy on them. If you don't like the other people in the group: tough toenails, so long as the work is getting done, it is getting done. You aren't besties with these people. In the event that one of your groupmates is doing something like plagiarizing his/her part of the assignment/not doing the work, call the professor in to mediate. That's not your job to handle."
college,fd3omyx,t3_ejzog5,1578160337.0,"I think the letter is fine. 

I would consider adding medical documentation regarding your health situation and some paperwork proving that the house was being foreclosed on (I assume the lending company that owned your previous home's mortgage would have sent some kind of notice). 

If I were a member of the committee I would be sympathetic to this, but I'd want proof that this all actually happened. If it's just the letter, it's just me taking your word for it. If it's the letter combined with medical and financial documentation, it's proven. 

Additionally, if you can get a letter of backup from a professor who knows you well or an advisor who says that he/she has discussed alternate ways of dealing with feeling overwhelmed rather than withdrawal, that will work. 

I don't know the exact policies at your school or if you are even allowed to include this extra documentation, but I would at least try to add it."
college,fd3da24,t1_fd2x550,1578157151.0,"Where FERPA is concerned, that doesnt matter.

Now, the parents can insist that the student show his grades or they arent paying, but its not clear if this is what the parents are doing or not. If the parents are threatening not to pay if they cant see the grades, that is a different situation. But that is not stated here."
college,fd0hcwz,t3_ejssal,1578118807.0,"Honestly, with that sort of availability I might consider looking into nannying if you are thinking about education, particularly working with kids. It would give you experience with kids and probably be pretty well-paying. Plus, I imagine the parents would want you to have a background check and first-aid certification, but I don't think you would need an intensive training course. However, it might involve weekend work. 

Otherwise, you may be able to look into being a teaching aide. I'm not sure what the requirements are in CA, but my cousin's ex-wife doesn't have a college degree of any sort and she works as a teacher's aide. Frankly, though, I wouldn't do it: they are ill-trained and make peanuts for helping the special education teacher manage the autistic child students each day. It is indeed a necessary job, but, frankly, if they had the money they would hire more trained teachers, not aides. I don't think it's worth the pay, but, again, it may be different in CA. 

Daycare centers are almost always looking for workers. Again, this is good if you want to go into childhood ed. You might have to have some kind of background check and first-aid training, but I wouldn't imagine anything intensive."
college,fd0b39x,t1_fd071bu,1578116299.0,"Then I would absolutely not take it; it will be a waste of tuition. Plus, you'll just be negative about it the entire time and that's not good for you or anybody else associated with the class. I would feel sorry for the professor that was teaching you and the classmates that would inevitably be paired up with you in workshops, frankly. Particularly for something like creative writing, which isn't a requirement and is generally seen as a ""fun class."" It's one thing for everybody to suffer through freshman comp, but creative writing? 

Plus, you're likely holding a spot that somebody else actually wants. Those sorts of classes tend to fill up. 

Drop it, and take something else. The only ""benefit"" I see here is making your mother happy, and, frankly, under FERPA (assuming you are US-based), she doesn't have access to your records unless you signed them away. So she's not going to know if you drop unless you tell her. 

Don't tell her."
college,fd09fgx,t3_ejru9f,1578115599.0,"I don't think it's worth it if you have to pay for it vs getting out earlier with less debt. Honestly, getting a double-degree has not been a serious advantage in any situation that I have encountered. If you have a career path in mind, it would probably be more advantageous to take the econ degree and seek an MBA with a concentration in whatever you're interested in. 

If it's not going to cost you anything extra and you aren't in a hurry, then, sure. Pick the one that you are most interested in. Out of that list specifically I'd probably either pick marketing or information systems, but that is entirely based on my own preferences. The advantages conferred depend on what you want to do."
college,fd08by6,t3_ejs14q,1578115142.0,"So does this mean that you are 12 months into the program? 

TBH, I'd ask if there is any way that you can finish the program remotely after the suspension is up, since you only have one more semester to do. If you can do it online, then your visa status doesn't matter. 

Alternatively... I am not sure about Canadian rules specifically, but I know that a common route in the US for this situation is to have the international student transfer to another institution for the length of the academic probation. But in your case, if you have to leave the school for 8 months just to attend for another 4 months, that seems a bit excessive. And expensive. And since it would put you in Canada for longer than your original visa, would probably be denied on suspicion of you throwing the classes just to get the extension. 

Though, I mean, really, with a GPA that low you may not even qualify for the degree you are seeking. In my program I get kicked out if I have below a 3.0 and they definitely wouldn't give me a degree. Even if you got a perfect 4.0 your last semester, would your GPA be high enough to graduate? 

But I would book meetings with your academic advisor as well as whatever body oversees your student visas to get actual answers to these questions that are specific to your situation. And I would check about remote possibilities for completing the program."
college,fd06pom,t3_ejs1ru,1578114452.0,"I would say it's a good idea to take a class in writing, if only because in... every single discipline you're going to have to do some level of writing. Some more than others, of course. But you're not going to be able to avoid it. 

I'd consider taking an intro-level course focused on the basics, if you are concerned about your writing being bad."
college,fczbvp9,t3_ejo4ey,1578097795.0,"1. Yes, it is normal and, in fact, very common. 
2. Relax. 

I know that 2 sounds mean, but it's not meant to be. It's your second semester of college. You are not locked into anything yet. I assume that you have gen-eds to complete: focus on those in the meanwhile and take time to think on psychology. If you don't end up pursuing it, it's not the end of the world. There are plenty of other things for you to do. 

Relax. Try to have fun. If you aren't enjoying soccer, you can always try something else. Try another sport, or volunteer in your local community or join an advocacy group. Or try art, or dance, or programming. But I might try to continue on with soccer for at least another semester and see if you enjoy playing it for its own sake, even if you don't gel with the actual people on the team. If not, then just stop. Honestly, it's likely you won't play after college either way. So if you're looking at it from a ""talent"" angle, your talent is going to go to waste eventually either way unless you have a shot at the USWNT or something. I'm not saying ""sports are a waste of time"" - they aren't, I played sports in undergraduate and loved it - but if you aren't loving it, there's no reason to do it. Find another community. 

Making friends takes time. That's just the reality of things. The friends you had at home didn't come overnight: neither will friends at college, or in adulthood. You can't hurry love, as the song says. 

Give college a chance. Actually, just FYI, people who move to other countries typically experience culture shock around the 3 month mark, which is where you are at in your college career. It gets better. Just give it a chance and give yourself some grace."
college,fczaxug,t3_ejo9y1,1578097244.0,"You could potentially rent a dorm over the summer depending on what your school offers. 

Other than that, subleasing. Craigslist can be a goldmine of this: plenty of students will sublet over the summer."
college,fcz72ay,t3_ejmxmq,1578094981.0,"Do your parents have to take you into your dorm? 

If you are worried about the waterworks starting when your parents leave, then I'd just say farewells in front of the dorm rather than inside it."
college,fcyry1x,t3_ejl1ia,1578085801.0,"I didn't keep them, because I know I wouldn't reference them. 

Do you actually reference your notes? If you still look at them, then, sure, you're using them and they are a valuable resource. But if you aren't using them and you just have a few boxes of 'em in your attic or whatever... it's nothing but a firetrap."
college,fcyoowj,t1_fcy4i53,1578084005.0,"The thing about participation is that, you are right: it is generally very difficult for professors to track participation with the same objectivity that they could mark whether your multiple-choice answer is right or wrong on the midterm. I have heard of some professors having TAs standing there and doing what you're saying, literally marking the amount of times somebody talks, but even *that* isn't really a fair judgement of participation. Some people just like hearing their own voice whether or not they have anything of value to say. And with a system where the more you talk the more points you get on a tally, you'll get a lot of people just saying literally anything since it gets them a tally. 

The main way to ensure that you have a good participation grade is to ensure that the professor knows who you are. In a good way. As in, they can picture your face when they read your name, recall your well-written essays, and remember that you made several valuable comments in class that started conversations and propelled the lesson. Maybe you also came to office hours and asked good questions about the material and projects. 

If you are *that* person, you are going to get a 100% participation score. Hell, even just sitting in class with no screen in front of you and *looking* engaged is probably going to be a boost. 

People who get good participation grades do more than just ask questions, though. They make observations, suggest ideas, and make connections between the current material and past classes/other classes you have had. Again, it is more than showing up. It's showing up and making your presence known."
college,fcylph7,t3_ejkmd6,1578082324.0,"In terms of study habits, I would recommend taking a speed-reading class. Many speed-reading classes break down how to approach textbooks and dense academic articles: they're not just about reading faster (though they can help with that, too). The Institute of Reading Development has a good one that gets offered at some college campuses at the beginning of fall semester. They aren't the only one to offer this service, though: your campus writing center may have suggestions for other options. 

One of the great arts to learn as a college student is to figure out what you need to read and when. In some classes you *will* need to do all of the reading. In some classes you don't. In some you should do the reading most of the time but if you slack for a day it's fine. Success looks different in each class and it often doesn't require plowing through an entire textbook. 

I would suggest getting involved in things that aren't directly related to a major if you are undecided on that front. There are plenty of sports teams, volunteer opportunities, advocacy groups, etc, that will help you meet like-minded people outside of your eventual discipline. I really would not be overly concerned about career path as a second-semester freshman. You have time. I assume that you have gen-ed requirements that you need to fill: focus on those for now. 

A bachelor's degree is not a master's degree. It's OK to change your mind."
college,fcxrncj,t3_ejhohg,1578069514.0,"At this point, if the final grades are entered, you're probably going to have to go through a lengthy appeals process to get the grade changed. 

TBH, the first thing I would do is revisit the syllabus. Does it say that subgrades will not be handed out for *assignments* or does it say that subgrades will not be given out *for the final grade*? That, to me, seems like the real nitpick here. A B- is indeed still a B grade, so that's not an issue. Participation is really a watery concept... and yeah, just showing up in class and being a warm body isn't going to cut it with a lot of professors. Were you on electronics at all during class? Some professors will dock points from participation if you're there but on your phone/whatever. 

If you want to pursue, I'd email and ask for clarification on the subgrades bit. But I'm willing to bet that the subgrades part only referred to how the prof grades in the class. 

If it were me, though, I'd ask about the subgrades and then probably drop it. The difference between a B and a B- doesn't seem worth it if the literal only consequence is not being on the Dean's List."
