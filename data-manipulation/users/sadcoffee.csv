Note: Some kids are sociopaths, it's not always the parents fault when the kid isn't trustworthy. A healthy relationship increases how likely the kid will be trustworthy/come to you with issues directly, rather than hiding them and hoping you won't find out. Keep in mind, you are raising adults, not kids. The same way you raise dogs or cats, not puppies/kittens.

That being said, this forum is dedicated for kids of parents who don't believe in having a healthy relationship with their kids or allowing their kids to grow into healthy adults."
insaneparents,ff9k59b,t1_ff8v33h,1579714716.0,"Your initial post reads like you assumed that was the assignment. That's why it is getting the downvotes.

I am fully in agreement with you: any school that tries to force students to pray should get the everloving crap sued out of them."
insaneparents,ff8oafb,t1_ff8aczj,1579688634.0,"My parents were fine with me learning about sex Ed in school. I was an awkward, insecure kid. I begged them to sign the note excusing me for it. I got 98% of my early sex education from a few TLC documentaries.

The remaining 2% I got from a book my mom gave me, and the talk about my ""changing body.""

Sex wasn't really an ongoing topic in our house. If it had been, I likely would have felt more comfortable with the sex Ed class in middle school... Then again, I was one of 2 girls in that 7th grade class, so... Maybe not."
insaneparents,ff8o2gr,t1_ff8n9vb,1579688299.0,"Schools cannot give assignments on praying. It's against the Freedom of Religion amendment. It doesn't matter which religion the prayer assignment is on, it's not allowed period."
relationships,ff58yf2,t1_ff4phjt,1579583792.0,"My dad separated from my mom because mom wasn't safe. If she won't leave, you can. You can get a new place and provide a safe home for your kids.

You are a grown adult in this situation. Act like one."
relationships,ff58c0b,t1_ff4jmaf,1579583222.0,"Not just that, but if this kid is merely a rebellion, having mom & dad approve kind of defeats the purpose."
blogsnark,ff56hjv,t1_ff1sg4r,1579581612.0,"We don't typically see/hear about Leta's friends. I hope she fits into her groups okay. When I was that age, I was pretty much an outcast, and I would have welcomed a move."
blogsnark,ff55xpq,t1_ff4dwxo,1579581154.0,"Not just this, but it does bring comfort to family who needs to follow your directive. Thankfully, my dad passed quickly from a heart attack, but I was his medical proxy. I was so relieved I never had to make a decison. If a plug needed to be pulled, I would have followed his wishes and felt so guilty about it (because emotionally/mentally/ethically it would have felt wrong to me). It was a comfort to my grieving imagination to come across his living will where he stated in writing the exact viewpoint we had discussed verbally in the past.

TL;DR: Put it in writing to bring comfort to your family, even if you know they will follow your wishes without the directive."
AmItheAsshole,ff23ef6,t1_ff0nt3a,1579492719.0,"This is only a reasonable step if OP expected to have kids over. Kids weren't invited, and most people don't invite untrustworthy adults into their homes."
relationships,fexxxks,t3_eqqfom,1579438121.0,"You already got a lot of great suggestions, but I'll tack on one more: Maybe do a weekly family dinner with your mom? If she is missing you, this in conjunction with trying to up her social life should help."
Libertarian,fexwjhp,t1_fewir8c,1579437642.0,"I am of the opinion if we don't have enough money to invest in our citizens (social security, college debt bailout, Healthcare, better standards for education in general, going after businesses who use welfare as a way to pad the wage they give workers, etc.), we don't have enough money to start up a war with Iran. I like to believe AOC & Bernie have a similar view."
