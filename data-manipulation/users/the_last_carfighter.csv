One thing I can say with certainty is there was zero chance he intended to do that. The left rear can be seen getting jerked by the diff action so no e-brake.  The conditions were too mixed to be even remotely predictable, the catch at the end looked anything other than professional.

(From an initial slide, more on that later) The wheel(s) is/are never turned to the degree it would have been necessary to properly save the car from the initial moments of the spin or to pick up grip on the way back round.  This is the reason I think inability and lots of luck just happened to work out for them. Had they had a more severe input (which is pretty typical for reasonably decent drivers trying to catch a spin) the car would have over rotated in that low grip situation, ""if"" no adjustments were made during the later part of the spin. The person barely had any steering inputs the whole time (my dumb luck theory) Also from the guys nose angle/angle of approach you can see he has already lost control of the car from what appears to be a simple overtake and if he had enough skill to recover from a full spin he never would have been in that position of getting into what looks like an over/under correction to a basic slide/drift in the first place.
