science,fetfinz,t1_fesjxqw,1579374944.0,Can confirm. I work for a pharma company on drug trials. They’re held to extreme standards internally to comply. An FDA audit is serious so they employ people like me to make sure the studies are following ich/gcp. We have interim analysis done every few weeks and at the end of the trial a database lock to review and clean up data before a final analysis. This is submitted to the Fda and to the sites for review.
