I'm at least FINALLY feeling rest, it's insane how it feels right? Hopefully you got the same feeling recently.

When you wake up or when stores open get yourself some melatonin, shit works wonders for sleep. I would take that and also l-theanine also amazing for relaxing and anxiety, load up on a few of those it's safe its what's calming in tea. NAC is a supplement that helps stops the cravings, they use it in the hospital when people take too much tylenol, it also works. If you cant afford those supplements just get some melatonin it's not too expensive and worth it. I wouldn't go to the bar, you know that's asking for it right now, just walk like crazy and get all that anxiety energy out, walk like a mad man around everywhere and exhaust yourself, just realize you have a serious detox going and THIS WILL PASS, stay strong you got this."

Just chill, congratulate yourself on stopping drinking that's huge! Then just work on stopping the others, no need to freak out at once, just snipe them off one by one over time, if you stopped drinking you can stop those.  I keep reating it in here but the best advice I read is to tie a habit you want to stop towards your identity, it's the best way to stop.

Your story sounds a lot like mine, although it has got me into some trouble (nothing major luckily) but I would drink at night and didn't think I had a problem because I didn't drink during the day. 

Well I'm finally just now getting good sleep, I'm watching all these science videos and reading papers and even moderate drinking really messes up our brains and bodies. One reason I decided to stop is I couldn't remember simple things I should have so I know this has really messed up my brain and I need to heal it.  Sometimes it doesn't show for a long time but the damage is being done.

No need to get sad about the big picture, I was but realized a lot of people are really excited they will never drink again (after a long time of stopping), others were able to drink a little (probably won't be me) but I won't rule out anything in the future. Point is though who knows what the future will bring but I know I can't drink for a long time, I need to heal myself and I have been feeling so great these past few days getting good sleep and having so much more energy it's not worth it for that buzz. 

I have said it before on here but the best method to stop bad habits is tie it to your identity, so start saying ""I don't drink anymore"" over and over to yourself and that will help you stop. 

So just let go of the big picture, I know how it is to worry about not ever drinking again, just go the cliche one day at a time and heal yourself and take it from there.  The better you feel overtime will hopefully be enough to realize you don't need it, that's what I'm hoping, good luck! We're early on but we got this."
