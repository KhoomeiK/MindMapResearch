A lot of cats get scared and shy when they are forced to be in a shelter setting, so they retreat and hide in their cages. When potential adopters come to look at them and they see a cat that won't come closer to them or even look at them, they will pick the next cat or go home without a cat. This program helps those cats become more comfortable with humans and learn new tricks to help them come out of their cages (figuratively and literally), so the next time someone comes to see them at the shelter, they can show off their new skills and friendly personality, which makes them waaay more likely to be adopted."

It really helps shy and stressed out cats learn to love humans again and makes them friendlier and more social. I don't have any specific numbers I can share, but here's a video of testimonials from shelters who have participated: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2NEHnm6Sag&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2NEHnm6Sag&feature=youtu.be)"
