Paper was introduced to Europe via the Islamic empire but still has its origins in China. Could it be the same with noodles? The Islamic empire was in contact with the Chinese empire in contact hundreds of years before Marco Polo. 

I guess it's down to what we call noodles/pasta. Is all fried/boiled dough considered noodles, dried noodles v fresh pasta, sheets v shapes and so on. It seems wherever there was wheat (and rice?) there was probably something resembling pasta/noodles/couscous. This is me just guessing/rambling now. I need to learn more about..., well, everything really. 

IIRC, the Chinese navy had a fleet of over 3000 ships before its destruction.  I've never seen that they weren't seaworthy, just a debate over size (Again, not an expert here).

Egypt had an amazing empire for 3000 years for the same reason China did, a great river. Egypt however was then ruled by other areas after that.

With the brief exception of the Mongols, China was never invaded and colonised the way Egypt was.

The people of England had Roman/Anglo-Saxon/Viking/French rulers, but it's all still English history, despite many invasions/foreign rulers.

explainlikeimfive,fga7qjy,t1_fga0xxm,1580647855.0,"Papyrus is basically just woven plants, not paper. Paper as we know it today was invented in China (like a regular sheet of paper from pulp) and the knowledge spread to Europe through the Islamic empire after its contact with China. They then brought the knowledge to Spain (part of the Islamic empire at the time) and started making it there. Up until then (1100 ish), Europeans had still been writing on parchment (animal skins). 

Marco Polo introduced pasta to Europe after his voyages to China. 

China has examples of basic symbols that date back 6000 years, though not a complete writing system. I believed that developed in the Bronze age around the same time as Mesopotamia. It wasn't the alphabetic system though.

The earliest printed texts are also Chinese as well as the world's oldest printed book is Chinese. Printing was invented there. The Gutenberg press was invented 600 years after in Europe but based on the original Chinese invention of the printing press.

Gunpowder is another biggie for China, they just didn't weaponize it at the time. We might be speaking a different language today if they had. You should also see the size of the Columbian era Chinese ships/Chinese navy, that were scrapped by an isolationist emperor fearing trade. They had the world's leading navy then with ships 5 times the size of Columbus' ships. They also invented the compass.

We're not taught Chinese history in the west, but it's pretty impressive. We like teaching our great accomplishments but not those of others.

Aphantasia,fg66mor,t3_ex1lsb,1580556357.0,"Welcome! It is a very interesting rabbit hole imo. After 40 years of not realizing 'picture this' meant that literally, I am fascinated by the variance in how humans process thought. 

Things for you to ponder..are all your senses affected? Total Aphantasia is a term some of us have coined for when all your senses affected as opposed to just not having a mind's eye. Many here can still audiate, recall smells and so on.

 What about recalling emotion? Do you remember being sad/happy at the time of a specific event or do you actually reexperience that feeling when recalling the event?

How do you experience memory? Is it a fact based series of events or do you 'relive' it? The one common theme we see is a possible link to SDAM. That doesn't mean we have bad memories, or amnesia, just that we store our information differently. Like a computer with no screen, the data is still there.

People who think visually often can't comprehend how we process thought, yet here we are. Personally, I feel like my thoughts are uncluttered by unreliable imagery and would be terrified if I started seeing things. Up until recently, I thought that was what hallucinating was!

Enjoy your journey, don't get put off by naysayers and downers and keep enjoying life while knowing more about yourself. Look up the Blake Ross article on his discovery of Aphantasia, 'how it feels to be blind in your mind', it's a great and funny article. Cheers!"

You owe him nothing, in fact, the opposite is true. He owes you years of support that would have been legally enforced in most countries. 

You did amazing OP, *despite* your dad. Be proud. You are amazing for helping your real family, the one who loved and raised you."
Aphantasia,ffw6omu,t3_evhsz8,1580286842.0,"You don't have to 'see' reading to enjoy a story. The book is just the medium.

Literacy is pretty new in human terms, hundreds of generations enjoyed stories before books. 

If you enjoyed reading before, then there is no reason not to enjoy it now.

Comparison is the thief of joy. Don't focus on what others have/can do. Just enjoy the stories."

askscience,ffr2kwa,t1_ffqziuz,1580149079.0,"There was a great documentary on the origins of the AIDS virus, The Bloody Truth. Basically, in colonial Congo, forced labour camps were a thing and because so many were forced to live in cramped quarters they started dying of of diseases like dengue and cholora, etc... Meanwhile, some escape to the jungle where they catch, butcher and eat bush meat, including chimpanzees. Virus crosses into human population at this point, around 1908. Meanwhile,  in the labour camps they vaccinated the forced labour (against cholora, etc...) with the same syringes, so any blood bourne viruses like HIV were spread to everyone. AIDS ravaged sub-saharan Africa (men and women) before it found its way out of the continent. Patient zero for NA was a male french canadian flight attendant if I remember right (seperate documentary).

Great documentary, amazing medical sleuthing. Samples in wax were preserved from that time and found in an abandoned hospital, and show HIV/AIDS was around for much longer than just the last 30-40 years, well before we could manufacture viruses."

How about getting them indoor shoes at the next visit/Christmas? My brother hates not wearing shoes and that's his solution. The shoes never go outside, they are his 'leather slippers'.

As an aside, is there any better feeling than liberating your toes from footwear? (The answer is no, taking off your bra when you get home is ever so slightly better.)"

A few different characters as well but the book authors also write/produce the series so the spirit is there. The series is about halfway through book 5 now.

Aphantasia,ffbs35r,t3_esoz42,1579780593.0,"If you can't voluntarily visualize, then yes, you have aphantasia. Please don't blame everything on it though. I can easily understand your teachers instructions/metaphors and I can see shapes in clouds as well as faces in my bathroom tiles. I still enjoy reading very much. I have never visualized a single snipet in my half century on this planet.

I took a course once where we had to do 'vision boards' because one loopy teacher made us watch The Secret (soo much bs btw). Even then, after making a ridiculous (but completely acceptable) board, I still didn't clue into the fact they were all daydreaming their futures. I was in my fourties before I figured that out. For your class, I suggest you mention your aphantasia to your prof (be prepared for some disbelief, bring info). Don't ever drop classes because of it, there is nothing you can't do because you don't visualize. Our brains use semantic and conceptual thinking instead of visual, and we are successful in all fields. This is not a handicap, it is merely a different way of processing information. While all my classmates were memorizing things to help them learn, I just seemed to learn and understand things intuitively. I was always top of my class.

My favorite quote: ""Comparison is the thief of joy"" 
Don't concentrate on what you can't do or what others can. Be glad for this insight, you know more about yourself now. Keep learning and enjoying life!"
