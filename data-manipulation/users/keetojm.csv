In the United States we want excitement in our sports.  
No one watches the NBA until the final 2 minutes.  
We will watch MLB highlights, but unless you are gen x or before in age range, you won’t watch an entire game.  
NHL, is either highlights or fights.  
NASCAR people get drunk and hope for car crashes. 
Before the NFL had to review every play, it moved pretty well, and every play could have something break off and cause people to lose their shit.  

Meanwhile soccer is a slowed down plodding version of hockey, but instead of fights they have floppers."
