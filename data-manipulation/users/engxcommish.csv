It's really hard because I like them all so much for their differences.

3. Seventeen Seconds
4. Wish
5. 4:13 Dream

lonely,fegnt37,t1_feg6yjk,1579098247.0,"I mean, typically looks are determined by a fairly strong consensus.  If 499/500 women in my age range and demographic find me to be unattractive (or, they all find that I'm not their type but surely any other woman would be lucky to have me) then it's not a matter of perspective.  I don't have what they're looking for.  Sure, I can get a new haircut, work out, and get my clothes tailored but that hasn't really helped."
lonely,fegnf3r,t1_feg2ok0,1579097960.0,"> Have a good heart and be an active listener.

That's important for making relationships last and be strong, but it doesn't help at all with getting initial interest, which is the biggest hurdle for most of us.  (particularly straight men.)  Complimenting, validating, and giving only supplements their feeling that they'd be dating down to be with you.  It's great for getting to be their emotionally supportive friend while they form a relationship with someone else, though."
AskReddit,fedo9u8,t1_febhex6,1579016297.0,"> I consider all life to be precious.

But... why?  It's not a limited resource, in fact we often have more than we can use.  People are often disposable and replaceable.  What actual reason is there to see simply ""life"" as precious without knowing more about that life in particular?

> Death is so final... I can see no reason why it should appeal to anybody if they are physically healthy beings.

Because life is full of suffering of all different types and death is in total absence of suffering.

For me, life is working 40 hours, extra work related stuff sometimes after work (including dry cleaning and whatever to maintain my getup), cooking, eating, shopping for groceries, being exhausted from work and living in general, coming home to no one, maybe hanging out with some friends a couple of times a week for a few hours to just pass the time away and feel some sort of human interaction, sleeping poorly and waking up anxious because nothing will EVER change, sleeping alone and waking up anxious and alone, fearing that I'll get fired because I cannot get another job, therapy because yes I am actually trying to ""get better""...

and then maybe getting a few hours a week in for my music writing/production hobby, which will never bring me any real fulfillment because I'm never going to reach anybody through my music because there are millions of other people out there who are as good or better and able to put more time into it.

Life is something like 60% neutral at best, 35% straight up shitty, and maybe 5% actually good."

ForeverAlone,fd2p1lh,t3_ejtryj,1578150319.0,"> Funny because she mentioned this happens with a lot of guys she talks to when really she's just trying to be a friendly person.

She likes people (as friends only, of course) who treat her better than she deserves because she's pretty and they think they have a chance.  Recently had a bad run in with that type.  It's not malicious, they just can't see through anyone else's eyes at all."

I don't know, and there's no source here, but if you asked me blindly what those numbers have typically been in America I wouldn't know if it's more or less than what's listed."
2meirl4meirl,fcbraza,t1_fcblr07,1577590104.0,"Ya well, that mentality is annoying and starry eyed because of the number of assumptions it makes.

First, that someone cannot just fail even though they tried hard.

Second, that success = enjoying what you are doing.

Third, that the universe rewards hard work when actually it's just that people reward value they can take from other people.

I radically changed fields, getting a BS degree from a very good university in a STEM field, then - because I was unhappy and wanted to try taking a leap of faith as you've suggested - I got a law degree from a very good law school, figuring that if the scientific side of things wasn't fulfilling me maybe something very different would. 

I'm still miserable.  I've never ""failed"", I just am not happy with a life where 40+ hours a week is spent doing something I wouldn't do if I couldn't get paid. 

To repeat, when it comes to job prospects, 98% of possible jobs are something I would hate and the other 2% are impractical or I'd have to get lucky as hell to make them work."

ForeverAlone,fb42p46,t3_ebdtgi,1576500019.0,"I do think it's your personality to an extent, but not whether you are a good person or if you're even someone they want to be around.  People throw the word ""confidence"" around, and while that's accurate it's not something you can just do.

There's a giant feedback loop that solidifies your roll once you get to our age.

I think I've always been average to a tick above average looking, but I've always been a dork.  (27 now for reference.)  So when I'd get a crush on a girl all the way back to middle school, I was that dork they were happy being friends with but didn't excite them at all with my ""personality.""  This subconsciously taught me that I don't have a chance, so I have ""un-confident"" mannerisms such as looking away or not being quite myself around attractive women.

It gets worse and worse as you get rejected over and over, making you less attractive, even though your looks haven't changed.  There's just nothing that stands out about someone shying away who would clearly be grateful for a chance with a woman.

For people who had success early on, they are taught that they belong, so they have that douchey type-A swagger to them that - no matter how obnoxious it is - just works.  It's an attractive way of behaving that can't really be faked, because it works on a very biological level."
