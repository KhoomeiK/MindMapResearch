facepalm,fcyvy9b,t1_fcyt4g5,1578088264.0,I see it as it's unfolding from reports on the ground in Syria not your fake news network. There has not been a single battle between ISIS and Iran/Syrian Regeime. All parties are allied against the Syrian rebels fighting for freedom. ISIS gets its money and weapons from iran and Russia and Syrian regime. Do more research and don't look at fox and CNN. Look at the reports and videos coming out straight from Syria and Iraq
