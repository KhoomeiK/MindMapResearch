selfimprovement,ffq8oxv,t1_ffq2lu8,1580126113.0,Agreed. I'm 29 and don't have WhatsApp and don't hear anyone talking about their WhatsApp groups. I'm sure some people use it but this whole list of expectations is over the top and bound to make anyone feel anxious.

selfimprovement,ff4vfox,t3_erljx2,1579573387.0,My friend made a huge career change last year at age 28 and became a fitness instructor. It's crazy how far she's come in a year and how different her life is. She's so much happier now. Just start heading in whatever direction you want to go in and don't worry about your age.
science,ff4und6,t1_ff4oshk,1579572848.0,"The VA loves evidence-based treatments, so once the evidence is better developed and it becomes formally recognized as an evidence-based treatment I think they will. But they don't jump on new treatments like this until they're officially recognized by the field as being evidence-based"

Neuropsychology,feu8zp7,t3_eqiyn9,1579384288.0,"New neuropsych post-docs (especially for research positions, but also clinical) get posted all the time, well after the match is over and into the fall. If you don't match, you'll find something. It might not be your first choice, but you can take a 1-year neuropsych fellowship (or rehab, gero, health psych, etc.) and then reapply to your first choices next year. It's not like internship where if you don't match you're kind of screwed.

I also recommend you stay away from student doctor network - that site is so toxic and is bound to make people anxious (in my opinion)."
psychology,fei8rto,t1_fei85mb,1579132816.0,"I'm a clinical psychologist and I'm giving you an academic definition of being mindful. Sure, there can always be research supporting and refuting the benefits of anything, but that isn't grounds to just dismiss all science as pointless."
psychology,fei7y28,t1_fei5kzv,1579132288.0,By mindful I mean paying attention to the present moment and accepting your thoughts and feelings as they arise without judgment. There is a ton of research supporting the benefits of this
psychology,fei4w85,t1_fehus5q,1579130346.0,There's a difference between actively problem-solving and ruminating. If you're mulling something over and you might legitimately think of a solution then that can be helpful. Otherwise being mindful and living in the moment is going to be much more effective  than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.

boston,fdn1n6w,t1_fdmefyt,1578574546.0,"""The majority of confirmed and probable cases in Massachusetts have involved vaping THC in some form. As of Wednesday, of 109 confirmed and probable cases, 40 percent vaped only THC, 35 percent vaped only nicotine, and 27 percent vaped both.""

The article and reddit both emphasize that most cases involve THC but is this a statistically significant thing to keep emphasizing? I mean, 67% involved THC and 60% involved nicotine. It seems like a fairly small sample size. Are there larger nationwide studies linking these deaths to THC? (please don't downvote me for asking, it's just a question)"

I think it's relatively common and harmless, especially if you have any childhood history of ear infections, but I'm no medical doctor. I am however a neuropsychologist and don't see what your symptoms have to do with aneurysms. Your primary care physician is probably the better place to start rather than a neuropsychologist"
