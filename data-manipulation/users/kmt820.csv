lonely,fejcq0l,t3_ep32jl,1579167494.0,i hope you find a nice person to hold hands with soon
depression,fejbzyx,t3_epewkn,1579166391.0,i too have no energies
depression,fe069b4,t3_enhbzz,1578804112.0,i think people who aren’t diagnosed but do have a lot of the symptoms for depression are still just as important. i have a friend who talks to me about how she feels and i think she is depressed but i’m not sure she’s ready to tell her family. i just barely mustered up the courage to tell my mom i need to go to my psychiatrist. it’s not always easy to talk about it especially if you’ve tried before but nothing is done to help you. welcome! and hang in there buddy
lonely,fe03uaf,t3_engfp6,1578802395.0,i’ve done that before i’ve even bought a weighted blanket to make it feel like someone was hugging me

lonely,fa9av73,t3_e7ub4h,1575867256.0,yes i'll even hug myself sometimes too and then i'll laugh at myself after because i probably look like a fucking idiot
