Which is all I said in my first comment.  But let’s also not lump all Republicans in with that rally. From what I remember that rally was made up of far right people, and most repubs are not that far right. Many just right of center, thanks in no part to the needle being move by, first Clinton, and then Obama. The left is too far right, and that falls in your line of reasoning saying, that the right is too far right, in turn. But really it’s a picture of Tom Morello that is the heart of the matter here."

I agree 100% with the sentiment. Nazis are bad. My grandfather fought them in WW2 and I would fight them again. But using the name Nazi to describe people with whom you differ is total BS. I understand the circlejerk is strong here and I didn’t know what I was expecting. It all started with me using the term Virtue Signaling. He has a big sign stating a fact that most everyone, and definitely everyone at his show, agrees with. So whatever. We change definitions all the time. Calling republicans Nazis is no different that saying this picture does NOT show virtue signaling.  There are agreed upon definitions for things people!!"

I am one accident away from homelessness. Like a lot of us.  I get hurt, I can’t work, I don’t pay mortgage, I lose house.  Not really fair in my opinion. And I do believe that I even have it really well compared to some, but if this is in fact the best country, richest, and most developed, shouldn’t we live well?  Shouldn’t schooling not put us in debt for the rest of our lives?  Shouldn’t owning a home and a car to get you back and forth to work be possible.
