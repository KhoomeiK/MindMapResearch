In fact it will probably decrease the small amount of those who do since there's not a government telling you what to do. In my country is not illegal to walk naked in a public place. Police can do nothing. So why it is that there's not more naked people than in the US? Social conditioning. 

That's the thing with libertarianism. You completely miss the fact that there's informal rules that hold very strong pressure on the individual that aren't related at all with what the law says you can or can't do."
worldnews,fejdakw,t1_feijpon,1579168364.0,"Maybe in the US. I can assure you that I can get naked in any public space in my country and the law will allow it. It's been proven many times before. But I'm sure that there's no more nude people on the streets in my country than in yours. Why is that? Because every citizen has been conditioned to follow this rule. And it's amazingly effective. People follow it way better than almost any real law.

The problem with libertarianism is that it's focused in government as if it was the only institution that can apply coertion just by the fact that it has the legal monopoly of force. You say that you want the social rules of a society without a formal estate. Let's take the Amish example. The Amish can get away with a serious amount of brainwashing and individual rights abuse because they let people leave if they want. Despite that, most Amish decide to live there rather than in the modern world, where they're granted way more rights. Why is that? Social conditioning. When you've been pressured by an oppressive society from your childhood, they get used to it and feel scared of having anything else. Ironically enough, a society that has no monopoly on force ends up being terribly oppressive, more than the modern world. I'm making a generalization. Not all Amish communities are Uber conservative, but the fact that many are and they're still there is very revealing. Same happens with people who live in fundamentalist Christian households. Religion in America has a massive power in society, even managing to get inside the education system. A very surprising thing, considering that they don't have any political power. The libertarian mindset will ignore these issues, since it is focused on the government. The government is nothing else than another institution of many. While they have legal power above others, they don't have as much social power. In fact, I'd say that religion and corporations have more power over the daily life of a citizen. And you can't escape them if you live in society. It's very important to notice your own shortcomings, and see how all humans are very easy to condition. The larger amount of people that hold libertarian ideas in America is caused by a group of corporations and think tanks that have been pushing for those ideas for decades. That's why there's not nearly as many elsewhere. While this doesn't mean libertarianism is incorrect per se, It a rather revealing idea that people should think about."

Neither are most informal contracts and obligations in life, which are the most important. Pretending that you do exactly what you want and you're not contrived by society is just naive. Being libertarian or not, we're all social animals who follow rules, for both good and bad. Sure, the law allows you to walk in public naked, but you won't. If we were bees, we would hold much stricter social rules. If we were lizards, we would live alone and do our thing except when mating. We're neither, so we like to be free but we also want to live together. That's the crux of human beings.

Acknowledging that we'll never be fully free, and that we don't even want that since it would mean to break our ties with other human beings, is a very important step to learn to be more free. The way I see, society is the most fair when we grant untouchable basic rights like the right to live and expression, but we set some rules that we all vote for or against to allow basic cohabitation. Even if there's not a formal state, those rules will develop naturally in every society. The fact that we can codify laws in liberal democracies makes us more free than in olden times when it was mob rule or the authority of a higher order."

But in such a neoliberal and morally corrupt world I guess this is something weird. I'd personally rather not have that and live without that money. But the thing is that British people overhype their royal family massively. I've been in the UK twice, and I don't give a shit. And I personally don't know anyone who went for the queen. They like Buckingham palace and the guard. Stuff that will be the same if the UK becomes a republic. Besides, you're behind France, Spain, Italy and Germany in tourism. That's amazingly low considering that you're the only (native) English speaking country in Europe other than Ireland. Tourism is not your thing, and the Queen won't help. I'm from a very touristic region in Spain btw. I'd give tourists to you gladly, I'm pretty fed up with them.

And about how popular it is, well, Ireland was ubercatholic back then and now they allow abortion. Same with my country. Give it 10 years after deposing them and nobody will even care. ""We need a royal family"" said no one ever"
todayilearned,fee2qbu,t1_fedzt5f,1579025175.0,"I'm not sure if that was your point, but expropriating the crown estate wouldn't be a conquest, but an expropriation, since the motive is not ""I'll take your lands because I can"", but ""I take them because it's for social interest and it follows the laws"".

I think your point was that it was that the right of conquest was accepted back then so the lands of the crown are legal. But I think you'll agree that what happened in 1230 doesn't hold much legal ground in current politics, so we can just expropriate those lands fine.

I mean, I'd love to see the royal supporters using the war of the roses as an argument why we should leave their lands alone. I'm sure it wouldn't be good PR for them"

I'd be worried if government had powers to arbitrarily take wealth from a particular individual just because it felt so. But the royals are the only individuals in a country that have a legal special status. If it's like in my country, Spain, the monarch literally can't commit a crime, by law. This is something that anybody with a mild semblance of common sense would find highly irregular and troubling.
