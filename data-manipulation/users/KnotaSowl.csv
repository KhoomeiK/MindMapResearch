The moment when she cuts the thread.""

Wow, this couplet is just beautiful. It makes me think of the red string of love that's supposed to tie soulmates together. I prefer the idea that we're connected to all of our loved ones with red threads, and we decide who we tie them too.

Because the poem has a strong existential feel to it, it feels natural that you're talking about death. So cutting that thread, to me, feels a lot like being disconnected from the ones you truly love in the only way that can feasibly sever you from them.

I find rhyming couplets all the way through a poem are hard to pull of but you clearly had a good idea of how to structure this to compliment your word choice.

Normally I think AA BB rhyming schemes are really easily made corny, so reading this was actually quite refreshing to read, didn't cringe once :p

The only thing I could criticise are the lines 
""Familiar circus had in mind.
A simple quest away I pined.""
Cus I struggle to see how it's connected to the rest of the poem. However, I'm sure if I poured over it more, something would come to me, as they're quite nice lines in isolation.

Well done, this was a lovely read :)"
