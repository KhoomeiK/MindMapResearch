gaming,ff8dp7v,t1_ff8aq9o,1579674188.0,"I’m a developer. Not even in the game industry where the pressure would be even higher. But it can be stressful when you’re in a crunch.

I had to talk to one of my coworkers today. He was clearly over stressed. Deadlines and workload and added work and added priorities and everything that clearly hurting his mental health.

I told him that I used to be in his situation but I’m getting better. I told him that we’re just devs. It’s out job to develop and to give reasonable upwards communication about whether goals are actually achievable, but we don’t need to worry. If you have ideas on how to improve things that’s awesome, but don’t let it get to you. You’re not management, you’re a developer. Management is responsible for worrying about deadlines, they get paid the big bucks and they get the big stress. We shouldn’t inherit their stress.

I still get stressed. Last week I ran a test that I was hopeful would solve a problem but didn’t. It meant I had very little time to solve the problem before the deadline. I could fail to meet the deadline imposed on me.

But I told myself that this isn’t my problem. I’m not paid a bonus based on making deadlines. I get the same hourly pay no matter what. And I actually asked for a raise the same day lol, 20%. I was actually told “I can’t say yes until it’s final, but it’s looking good that you’ll get it”. I was then told it was taking longer because the final approval guy is on the road. But I am very hopeful on getting a 20% raise tomorrow.

You can worry yourself to death, or you can say “fuck it, I’m not worrying about this at all, and I want more money”

And yesterday I found the problem(s) and today I verified a solution. So it worked out after all."

An easy way to understand this is by making up a fake situation where it’s clearly false.

Imagine women are all fit at 18, but then half of women stop caring for themselves and gain weight. Others take care of themselves and remain fit.

Now let’s say women are only attractive if they are fit, but women continue to get more attractive until they are 30, given that they remain fit.

In this hypothetical situation 100% of 18 year olds are attractive, 50% of 30 year olds are attractive, yet every attractive 30 year old is more attractive than they were at 18.

This hypothetical situation isn’t realistic, but it shares some qualities with reality. Heavier women are typically viewed as less attractive, and women are more likely to be overweight at 30 than at 18."
