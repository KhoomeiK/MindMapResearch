Your mom definitely doesn't own the account, but neither do you. You just preemptively made the decision because it's what YOU felt was best. If you wanted to ""send grandma a message as a way to cope"" write an email and delete it if you're so worried about your mom snooping.

Everyone's grieving here but your mom probably feels like you took something away from her that she was using to feel closer to her mother.  I get why this is weird for you, but this is HER MOTHER.  A few months is nothing for that kind of grief."

She was wrong to bully you and try to guilt you. You're wrong for thinking that it's as simple as ""pregnancy effecting your brain chemicals? get a different job!"" Our decision making processes are effected by everything about who we are... hormones, childhood, that near accident on the drive to work, stressing about bills, etc. Plus, as a female, you should know how crazy hormones can make you, and that's on a monthly basis.

IMO, you handled it the best way you could. You've been up front about expectations and she's not meeting them. In my mind, it would be no different from her just pulling out a bottle of whiskey at 9am and chugging it down, then getting mad because you call her on bad behavior. Doesn't matter what the behavior is, you find it unacceptable.

You've never said you don't want her to be grandma. Just that she needs to stop being so dramatic and negative. The persecution complex needs to go, not the person. Have you tried suggesting that she seek help with her insecurities and persecution complex? Obviously she can't handle it on her own."

Clothes can be changed in minutes, so asking you to dress in a certain manner is understandable. 

Asking to you PERMANENTLY alter your appearance is another matter entirely. That's no different from asking someone to lose 20 pounds or get a facial tatoo. It's a one-day party. Asking for a permanent alteration is beyond rude.

Your wife sucks for not cleaning up after her cat. I can totally get why you'd be frustrated. But you suck for going against her express wishes. Shaving isn't natural for animals and it can possibly lead to other issues. But you didn't do any actual harm to the cat, so it's forgiveable IMO.

Also, hair balls aren't natural to cats. It's a food allergy that causes their insides to become inflamed, preventing the hair from passing naturally. I would recommend sticking to better quality foods or even the Whole Hearted Easy Digestion food from Petco. I have owned/fostered anywhere from 5 to 15 cats/kittens at a time for over 10 years (working with a rescue). Number of hairballs? Almost none. The only cat that has a VERY rare issue I switched to the Easy Digestion and she has had zero issues since. Nothing from any of the rest because I feed good food to all my pets/fosters. Seriously.

You might consider allergy testing and/or eliminating foods from the cat's diet until you know what the allergy is. (Basically, cut back to simple foods like cooked chicken and rice with no seasoning. If the hair balls clear up, try adding a different protein.)"

(1) For a lot of people, pets are basically their children. Just because you don't feel that way doesn't mean she thinks ""oh it's just a cat"" too. It sounds to me like she's a true animal lover. 

(2) The plug-ins aren't hoaxes. I worked with a rescue for over 10 years and the good plug-ins (Feliway) have worked wonders time and again for stressed out cats. They can also reduce fighting between cats.

(3) You're not even close to qualified to judge the cats age. You're not a vet, or even a vet tech, or even someone with years of experience dealing with cats.  If the professionals can't pin down an age (which can be hard sometimes, with injuries and illness), then you're certainly in no position to judge.

(4) You're awfully dimissive of Sarah's feelings, for all that you CLAIM you love her and want to move forward with the relationship. In fact, you're all worked up because of what her mom called you, but you're completely disregarding Sarah's feelings and dismissing her a stupid and gullible. You also claim to not be controlling but you're arguing relentlessly over this says otherwise."

Like others said, you went above and beyond in trying to assist her with accommodating your dietary restrictions. She's just being a bad host at that point. And it IS completely unreasonable to invite someone to a dinner event but expect them to not eat or eat something that could potentially make them ill. TBH, even if it was just something you didn't like the flavor of, would she still expect you to just deal? I mean, if I'm invited to dinner but they're only serving liver and onions, I would react the way you did - offer options or just not attend.

Granted, a lot of people think being vegan is strictly a choice and don't realize after being that way for a year you actually risk having detrimental reactions to eating animal products. I would point out to her that the risk to you is less dangerous than but very similar to a reaction her child might have to peanuts.  If anything they probably classify religious dietary restrictions as less of a choice. Honestly, people just think ""it's no big deal, suck it up and push the meat to the side"" because they don't know any better."
