I don’t see any harm in changing the rules for your campaign but i feel doing so would take away from the sword’s power and significance.

LiverpoolFC,ff2ow91,t1_ff2d985,1579517025.0,To be fair it’s more likely everyone was completely exhausted at that point. Allison has the freshest legs of all of them.
soccer,ff1ezuj,t3_eqzypg,1579478347.0,Best I’ve seen United play all season and we’re extremely unlucky to not put a couple passes Liverpool but Liverpool were on a completely different level. I know it gets thrown around a lot but they are mentality monsters and that was the key difference between the two. Not once did they put the foot off the pedal - not even in the dying seconds while they were already winning. That’s what makes this Liverpool team a head above any other team in the league and in Europe for that matter.
LiverpoolFC,ff19sa4,t1_ff0ji5l,1579476631.0,This game especially. Unlucky to have not scored that belted against the woodwork.
LiverpoolFC,ff19l1v,t1_ff10vgi,1579476574.0,Can’t be offside in your own half.

soccer,ff1845l,t1_ff03vi6,1579476153.0,"Goal was important because of how dramatic the match was all throughout. Clinching an extra time goal against your fiercest rival on home ground is about as dramatic as it can get in football. United also put heaps of pressure on Liverpool this half and we’re unlucky to not put a couple passed them.

The defender chopping Salah to stop his run wouldn’t have made sense considering Liverpool were already on the cusp of winning. No sense in getting yourself an instant red and automatically missing the next match for a game you’ve already lost. If the two clubs were level and Salah had this break, I can 100% guarantee the defender would have chopped Salah down without a second thought."
