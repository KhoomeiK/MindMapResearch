AskReddit,ff8qay4,t1_ff8o81n,1579691584.0,"Just say whatever you're thinking, doesn't matter if it's important or not.

Honestly, everyone says everything they're thinking, and you listen to it all the time.  Why shouldn't you say what you're thinking?

It's weird to consider, but honestly conversation is just speaking your thoughts outloud sometimes.  Who cares what people think, *especially* when it's a topic that you're not particularly interested in.  I make small talk by saying the most inane things, things that add nothing new to the conversation, just to keep the waves moving.  It doesn't matter if you're adding important insight, just say whatever the hell comes to mind.  It'll give the other person something to bounce off of, and it'll give you more to branch off of.

Sometimes you can just repeat what the other person is saying but in another way, or in the form of a question, and they'll take that and run with it.  Small talk with strangers isn't about deep shared experience, though sometimes it can be, but it's mostly about passing the small amount of time you have together.

You're only going to see that person for a few minutes, it's a great time to say the stuff you really have been wanting to say without it impacting your usual social circles."

heroesofthestorm,ff6a8gq,t1_ff629s2,1579622752.0,"This isn’t anywhere near true. You can play along with Butcher like you can any other hero.

TLV puts you into an eternal 4v5, more like Abathur than anything else.

The only thing you need to do with Butcher is follow up on his CC, which is true of any of the dozens of heroes with CC."
