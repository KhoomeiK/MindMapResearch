gaming,ffki0z1,t1_ffkgfvl,1580023092.0,Oh okay so it's like that then. Good to know. I think it's fairly easy. Wish I had known this when I was a kid but I don't think I'll be playing Free cell anytime soon
AskReddit,ffkhg7y,t3_etts4s,1580022819.0,"""I can. I will. I must. I shall make it happen.""

""Everything happens for a reason.""

""I cannot change the past. It is what it is. Life goes on so I won't stand still."" 

I think of those phrases in my head whenever I feel so down and just feel like giving up. It has thankfully worked for me and helped me through tough times."
gaming,ffkeucl,t1_ffjuuyl,1580021602.0,I literally still had no clue up to now the mechanics of that game. I just remember selecting random cards as a kid and found it fun and I don't even know if I won or not
gaming,ffkefi7,t3_eu0ezd,1580021415.0,Good old days for sure. Pinball was always my go to game lol
infp,ffgivr6,t1_ffgal1y,1579907259.0,Aww that's so nice. Must be really nice to gaze at something like that during your trip!
AskReddit,ffg7i6g,t1_ffevheb,1579900127.0,Why haven't I heard of this goatman? But that's creepy really.
gaming,ffg75sz,t1_fffdfbt,1579899912.0,I bought it last Winter Sale because I got so curious and especially with the series coming up that time. I've been playing it for a month now. Still 24 hrs in game but it's been amazing. It was really worth it. I hope you get to play it though
infp,ffg6azb,t3_et8gp9,1579899383.0,"Oh my goodness! That is spectacular. If I was there, I'd really be in awe and stare at the sky for a good 10 minutes or so lol"
infp,ffe48er,t3_esymbu,1579836278.0,Yes. Whenever I delve too deep into my thoughts so much and voice them out or even in group chats with some of my friends some or most of them would ask me if I'm okay or chalk me off as being too serious or like saying what's going on with you. I just don't bother explaining to them why because it's another whole set of things that needs to be explained further. I got used to it by now and pretty much just keep such thoughts to myself unless I deem a person as someone who can really understand like say a fellow INFP. :)
pcgaming,ffds7ll,t3_esugpx,1579827617.0,Oohh I'm happy it's available for PC!
AskReddit,ffdlncb,t3_esse9d,1579823509.0,That random guy from the club I talked to with. We got along pretty well talking just about anything and everything. I was a little tipsy and we were both awkward and it was just cute. It was only about two hours but it felt so long. Talked until the club closed waiting outside for our cabs and said goodbye. Only knew his name and didn't exchange numbers. That was almost a year ago and it was such a fond memory.
GetMotivated,ffddinv,t3_esutn7,1579818602.0,Exactly. There's so much more important things than what we worry about everyday. I'm always in awe with the universe and everything. I don't know if everyone is like that but that's just me.
infp,ffd7a0d,t3_esv2f0,1579814800.0,I know and letting in just a few select people into my personal life.
infp,ffbl2ob,t1_ffav05i,1579770527.0,Good thing I don't have these people in my circle of friends because my god I wouldn't know what to do.
infp,ffbl00u,t3_esk053,1579770413.0,I just wait for them to leave me a message. If they don't then okay I guess it wasn't urgent.
infp,ffb5dle,t1_ffb59hq,1579752237.0,You're welcome!
infp,ffam2g8,t3_esaxet,1579739129.0,It looks amazing.
AskReddit,fey8slu,t3_eqphy8,1579442220.0,"Most probably that unexpected and horrifying scene in Hereditary when Charlie got decapitated. It was mixed emotions of fear, shock and mostly dread. I felt like I was in Peter's shoes and absolutely don't know what to do after. I was traumatized by that scene for a little while."
introvert,fey7ntc,t3_eqtpg1,1579441846.0,Yes all the time
introvert,fey6nyd,t3_eqp5uv,1579441426.0,I always look forward to that and it makes me feel happy
infp,fey3au0,t3_eqlw0o,1579440222.0,I usually text back because idk I don't want people to think I ignored them whether I like them or not
infp,fey30eh,t3_eqtzf2,1579440089.0,That's beautiful.
depression,fewvdke,t1_fewt21v,1579420077.0,Alright then.
funny,fepvhyy,t1_fepupsy,1579332786.0,No way of knowing
funny,fepv8ez,t1_feps546,1579332509.0,I see now and I get your point. Apparently I didn't get the random jokes it's not that I wasn't accepting or enjoying them
funny,fepmbzf,t1_fepl998,1579324293.0,Uhm none of those really
funny,fepl4vj,t1_fepkm8p,1579323364.0,I only found the line 'lab for testing' funny because I work in the lab and didn't reference the dog or whatsoever
funny,fepj5mh,t1_fepiqzl,1579321847.0,Not a dude but I don't find it gross
depression,fepi906,t1_fepfajr,1579321179.0,I'm trying to give you something positive because I know what it's like being depressed and it's not a nice place to be. We all have a future and so do you
depression,fepf5yj,t1_fepcvbo,1579318970.0,You don't know the future. It's better to hope than not.
funny,fep73ke,t3_eq9c63,1579313614.0,I work in the lab so I found this quite funny lol
depression,fep3x1f,t3_eq7hc5,1579311575.0,I am deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a cat or a pet is just incredibly soul crushing. I've lost so many now and there's no getting used to that feeling. There's just no words to say to make it all better. It's really hard but just know that he lived such a wonderful life with you and that he's free from pain now. I wish you all the best. Rest in peace Midnight.
infp,fep0tde,t3_eq8jbq,1579309606.0,"I sometimes feel in a limbo when I don't have that special someone whom I know I can connect with in a deeper level and to talk about life and other deeper things. I can relate to what you're saying that life is indeed better if you share it with that someone when you find them. I do believe eventually all of us will. Hopefully. There's nothing wrong with you. I mean isn't that what we all just crave for? Just to be simply in love. In my opinion, it just gives more meaning to mundane things in life."
infp,feozwy6,t3_eq8drf,1579309036.0,I found it funny lol but yeah sounds about right
gaming,feowbc6,t1_fenj831,1579306795.0,Nope. Never have.
depression,feovyqi,t3_epym4o,1579306586.0,Belated Happy happy birthday to you! I hope you had a wonderful day
infp,feovsrs,t1_feooqzt,1579306485.0,I'm a huge cat lover but I would never watch the Cats movie. I don't know why but it's just weird for me and I've always pictured cats speaking just like humans each with different personalities. Thank you! I hope you enioy finding one :)
depression,feotvzd,t1_feo3pkh,1579305417.0,Bad things will happen but so does good things. Maybe the good things hasn't come your way yet but it'll come.
infp,feohpub,t3_eq0sc8,1579300378.0,How about a cat? :)
AskReddit,feoh637,t3_eq1wzh,1579300037.0,Probably to progress more in The Witcher and to have one of my cats beside me would be lovely but that's just to 95% happiness perhaps.
GetMotivated,fekd4ud,t3_epjjl6,1579197550.0,Thanks. I pretty much needed this.
introvert,feezpli,t3_eortu0,1579044791.0,You're not alone. I rehearse what I say when I really need to make a phone call. I make a list on what I need to say and look at my cheat list during the call and I have to do it alone in my room so I won't get too anxious if there are people around. It's weird but I have to do it
infp,fe5usta,t3_entdo8,1578875429.0,Sure why not?
depression,fdsf27z,t3_emrpqy,1578701256.0,Happy Birthday to you! I hope you enjoy your birthday and this year. :)

AskReddit,fcafp6a,t3_egroo0,1577568435.0,Probably the Selfie song by Chainsmokers or that Pen Pineapple Pen song ugghh
