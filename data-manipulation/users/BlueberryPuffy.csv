CICO,fgtb0ns,t3_f0a6ho,1581101990.0,"Definitely practice eyeballing serving sizes at home, but there are guides to help you estimate. If I’m not sure I try to overestimate how many calories are in it, that way if I’m wrong I’m not causing more weight gain. A guide like this is helpful in the real world: https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2013/02/portion-control-use-visual-cues-to-remember-serving-sizes"
AskReddit,fgkejb4,t3_eyus0a,1580863704.0,Not letting anyone else get a word in. This goes for all sort of relationships. I’m not super talkative so if I can’t even get a word in then you need to take a breath.

unpopularopinion,fg5ayvd,t3_ewxwm4,1580522753.0,"Agreed. Dogs are cheap, you just look at them and you’re instantly their favorite person for 5 seconds. With cats you have to earn their love but once you do you will always be *their person*. We’ve had my kitten since she was <8 weeks old and since day one she has slept with me. Every night she comes to bed with us and curls up on my chest under my chin, she’s never gone a night without it. She’ll try to give me kisses on my mouth nose and chin, and knead me until we both fall asleep. “Unaffectionate” my ass!"
