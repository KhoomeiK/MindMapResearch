britishproblems,ffel99d,t1_ffdxunq,1579852808.0,Putting marmite on the toast is delicious.
dogs,ff36khz,t1_ff36by1,1579534896.0,"Thanks and I’d forgotten about that pic! He seems to be more interested in dry food when he’s got the treat ball. Just thinking about varying up his diet, still plan to keep him on some dry."
dogs,ff36282,t1_ff2zx5h,1579534545.0,Thanks for that!
dogs,ff35v65,t1_ff34dba,1579534409.0,"He’s usually running on his walks, never had any interest in playing fetch. Not able to post recent pic but there is a pic of him aged 6 months in my previous posts. Will try to upload recent one when on laptop. He’s just back from 2nd walk of day and we try to vary it up for him."
dogs,ff2vzg4,t3_ercljz,1579526259.0,"Thanks, he is a very big border. His breeder said his litter were the largest pups she’d ever had and he’s never been determined as overweight at the vet but totally get what you mean.

I may try to feed him dry food with treat ball. Never thought he could be fussy re lack of exercise, he gets 2-3 good walks a day and one full day out a week."
CasualUK,fex7qqf,t1_feuolxo,1579426340.0,"I always do my best to park courteously, close to the pavement, leave car in front/behind space to get out but I once got a note left on my car to say my car had taken up to spaces for one car and I should think of others. Reason for bad parking was I’d given birth about 4 days earlier and it was my first time driving since. Since then I do try to give benefit of the doubt to bad parkers."
PandR,fembxe3,t3_epeh5z,1579247809.0,Tbh I noticed it in galentines day but not 94 meetings and I watched that ep last night!
TheDarkTower,fe9lil5,t3_eo0m1c,1578939137.0,"This is why it took me best part of five years to read dark tower series. I read hearts in Atlantis, Salem’s lot, various short stories, wind through the keyhole, amongst others!"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fe9jyfg,t3_eo4o7k,1578938468.0,Doesn’t look like he’s abiding by the j j bittenbinder method.

AskReddit,fe6suez,t3_eo11dh,1578903782.0,"Sims 2, I’d happily have that be the only game I ever play. Do love a bit of god of war, minecraft and horizon zero dawn but always go back to the sims."
AskReddit,fe6sjph,t3_eo11ui,1578903376.0,"Had a week off work, spent most of it on the sofa playing sims 2 on my laptop. It was heaven!"
AccidentalRenaissance,fdqz3vh,t3_emmysz,1578677156.0,Thought it was Jenny Slate when I first saw the pic!
handtools,fdo95vh,t1_fdmaiik,1578601044.0,We sell refurbished vintage tools at my work. Chisels are one of our best sellers and none of them are new. Sorby and Mathieson are other good makes.
Sims4,fdo5nph,t3_em7qz1,1578599329.0,Ive played Eliza once. She had identical girl triplets who all ended great tbh. Ended up marrying one to my legacy family.
britishproblems,fdmxyqu,t1_fdmuhue,1578570774.0,"If they could invent some sort of accessory that went on front of pram to push these kind of people away I’d buy it. Thinking cow catcher, cattle prod or maybe a toddler operated trebuchet to throw used nappies at them!"
UKParenting,fdklweh,t3_elq6fc,1578506264.0,"CBeebies introduced my kid to Peter Rabbit, it’s on Netflix as well and she’s obsessed with it. She likes hey duggee but not as much as me!"
writing,fdi4v2w,t3_elcwqc,1578435768.0,"I used to write so much then had a kid; went from reading books all the time to trying to read 10 pages a day. Went on a big family holiday last year and I read so much, got through about 3 books in a week and my writing mojo came back big style. Just started chapter 6 and kept up with my reading. Honestly, I can’t stress how important reading is whilst trying to write. And try new things, I recently read one book that I hated but made me realise that’s a style to avoid."
LiveFromNewYork,fd85y0d,t3_ek5001,1578214277.0,I’m in the UK and it’s a pretty big brand over here. A lot of the posh interior design shops sell it. It’s an aspirational paint brand when you don’t want bog standard like dulux or b&q.
Tools,fd83c2r,t3_ejyink,1578213464.0,"I bought my nephew a tool box full of tools this Xmas, ended with him, his brother and my daughter all playing with them. My daughter has a thing for hammers, yesterday she was trying to pick up a sledge hammer but think she’s more into claw hammers!"
Showerthoughts,fd3dlrm,t3_ejwrr3,1578157253.0,There’s a great episode of Frasier that has Derek Jacobi playing an actor who Frasier and Nile’s loved that’s now a washed up sci fi actor (think Alan Rickman in Galaxy Quest). They remember him as a wonderful actor when he’s actually terrible. It’s amazing seeing such a wonderful actor like Jacobi ham it up. Though he is also the narrator for in the night garden so think he quite enjoys hamming it up!

whatsthatbook,fcdoiv0,t3_eh362j,1577611980.0,When did you read this? Sounds similar to something I read in the mid 90s.
UKParenting,fc808jh,t3_egepw2,1577523389.0,"We have one rule for daughter, no Peppa Pig. What did MIL get her but a Peppa Pig pram for her dollies. Apparently that was the only pram that Argos had! As for dollies she has the maternal instinct of a brick and would rather have robots and rabbits."
futurama,fc5cvda,t1_fc5csg3,1577453650.0,That episode gets to me even more now I have my own Seymour.
funny,fc33kxm,t3_efuv5v,1577380625.0,"Has your daughter been watching a lot of Adam West’s Batman? See that a lot on that show, things and buildings with labels like  ‘rare art map’ and ‘disused boxing gym’."
dogs,fc2a5ne,t3_efon9j,1577348090.0,"My dog doesn’t get an Xmas dinner but he does get a special birthday dinner. Last year it was cheese and ham omelette on sourdough toast. This year it’ll be something with tuna, soon as I start opening a tin he’s there waiting for a bit!"
