They are accepted for what they are and fit in as long as they keep one form that is registered with their nation's government. If they change form in public, they might be seen as a spy and either thrown out or killed. In the Reihenian empire, however, there are very few, but there are some who would hide shapechanger children and use them later in some sort of scheme when they've developed.

There is also a civilization of these Shapechangers far to the west of the continent, where they originated. They possess almost modern technology to our standards: electricity, plastics, etc., and a population greater than the entire Reihenian Empire in one city.

As for their abilities, they can transform into any humanoid form as long as it possesses the same mass or less. Lowering their mass drops out the excess in dirt, which is not recoverable, however some more developed Shapechangers can use this extra mass by making new clothes.

With the help of the country of Westwheat, whose assassin had just killed their king, they drove back Frostlake into their land and negotiated peace with them. Due to their large expanse of land, they didn't just capitulate instantly; over the next year or two, rebellions popped up Mountainpass to try to take back their land, surprised when their own country's soldiers came to sweep them up.

Everyone on the continent is evolved from Shapeshifters. Long ago they landed on the continent and spread like wildfire, able to adapt to any environment easily. When they finally made permanent settlements, they lost this ability and began to diverge into the many different races. All sapients, besides Dwarves, Gnomes, and Dragons, originated in this way. Those three had been on the continent for millions of years.

The Free Cities are an inproportionally industrialized group of allied city states whose influence spreads wider than any kingdom on the continent, as their ports and research centers allowed for easy travel around the edge of the continent, avoiding difficult terrain. Since 2,000 years ago they've had steel, thanks to the Dwarves who lived in the mountains nearby.

One of them grew up on the battlefield, having been trained all her life with blades. Averil was younger than any recruit at the first battle against the orcs, and yet she still killed more than the most skilled soldiers. After the first year of battle, the king who was her mentor brought the second Knight, who was a giant man he had brought back from his travels in the savage Great Forest. His name in the forest-people's tongue was hard to say, so people took to simply calling him ""big guy"" or ""sir"". He and Averil became quick friends, even outside battle, as they both loved dogs. The big guy had to leave his pet wolf, who was in fact over 75 feet long, to come north and participate in the war.

The next two came along the way naturally: Fenwick, the son of the Count of Westwheat and the biggest, burliest man since Wallace I, and Richie, a twisted Halfling man who lives off battle.

I realize suddenly that I've taken this question far too seriously and introduced my ""knights"" but not things with the ""Knight"" theme

... But whatever!

Today they're still skilled generals and commanders in the military. Averil trains spies and assassins, while the big guy and Fenwick train everyday soldiers. Richie... He has his good side, but he's still as much a cretin as he was 15 years ago.

Plus, it brings trade in to allow passers by to just check in at the bottom level to see what's for sale. As you suggest, from time to time the merchants do go up to get cheap labor, but the richest have the influence to get the pick of the litter of people in the boilers for free.

The poor district is above the merchants because they are made up of the people who couldn't afford to get back down or couldn't get up to the residential districts. Sure, the people walking around down there are going to be poorer than the middle class, but they're there because they work for the merchants. In the government's view, it certainly doesn't bring a bright view of the place to have the first thing you see going in to be the poor. 

No, the government gets its money from taxes for water and such, and the way they're going to get that is by having people see the nice areas with all the nice people and then take an elevator straight up to the residential area and buy or rent a place.

I do however admit perhaps the poor district should be smaller than the residential. Or maybe it shouldn't be a floor at all; it could be an area on the bottom level, and the merchant district is right next to the gates so you can see those right away."

Consequently, the poorest end up at the bottom, while higher up are the officials and permanent residents and nobles.

They have a complicated piping system that delivers water to residences and public locations across the city's width and height, the amount to where governed by the officials at the very top, where the mechanism for dividing it goes.

At the very bottom of the city, even below the merchant district and poor district, is the Boiler Burrough. This is where very poor people and prisoners go to either make enough coin to leave or to live out their sentence. They spend their time operating filtration devices to salvage as much water as possible from sewage, and from the waste filter out and process manure, which goes to the farms in the outlying area which are also government owned.

Those who have committed bad enough crimes to be put to death are taken out to the edge of the poor district and dropped into the sewage pit. Very few have survived this process, and it saves some energy burying them or cutting off their head.

The idea of multiple tribes of orcs, however, came earlier than my themes.

On the other hand, when I developed original cultures, such as the Columnians (dark skinned humanoids who have crimson hair, grey sclera, and can turn to dust) or the Apollans (""giants"" who live in an enormous forest and have domesticated wolves the size of skyscrapers) there is much less nuance in their original creation.

It kind of accidentally matched the themes I have been going for. Many conflicts in my world, major and minor, from wars to lasting prejudice, arose from appearance of peoples. The idea that everyone came from a single species (as we are in our world) gave me the idea someone might come across this information and try to overcome centuries of bloodshed and discrimination.

Nowhere on the mainland is infinite slavery practiced. Usually, it's limited to indentured servitude in the Reihenian empire, and in the Free Cities, you are entirely not allowed to work if you have no money, so you have to pay your workers a livable wage in order to keep workers.

In the Elven lands of Aeran and Dracaena, slavery is limited to the Shapeshifters who are born every so often and then sent to the other land to spy on things. Deidran Sobekites are nomadic and can't have weak people weighing them down, while Crogall Sobekites and most tribes of orcs will simply eat captured people.

The only place where slavery is practiced on a large scale is the land of Littlemoon and the island off its coast, the Claws. Here, powerful criminals live in castles like kings, and under them the mercenary bands fight gang wars and govern their territory. Many of these groups buy slaves to be used as fodder in these wars, while some buy them to release them, allowing them to leave or join their gang on good terms."
