Later adoption by the original creator doesn't make it not a fanwork. You obviously think it does, and I don't care enough to keep arguing over the same thing with you."
wholesomejojo,ffa1uv5,t1_ffa1f9y,1579726202.0,"You and I have very different ideas of what is official work and what is fanfiction, and that's perfectly fine."

wholesomejojo,ffa0qoz,t1_ffa0f0n,1579725550.0,"It's a fanwork that has artwork from the original creator. It's a fanwork with fanwork. It is not official content. I appreciate that Araki drew up the original characters, but that doesn't make it an official work."
wholesomejojo,ffa008r,t1_ff9zd95,1579725121.0,"That's fair. Araki seems the kind of guy to recognize what his fans are creating, though. I wonder what would happen if he had to answer the question of PHF's background for Fugo vs David Production's."

For the parents to reach out to family to ALSO lash out at OP is unacceptable. Paragraphs of personal insults are unacceptable. This is more than an immediate emotional response."

beauty,ff7arvg,t1_ff79xl1,1579644888.0,The tone of your comment came across as condescending by saying the OP didn't understand beauty and skincare. It's clear that you didn't intend that and I don't think the other posters responded appropriately.

femalefashionadvice,ff4uwux,t1_ff4ryal,1579573029.0,"The phrasing ties the group in with the rest of it. The noun is mess, the adjectives are frumpy and Mennonite. Putting Mennonite in with ""frumpy mess"" ties it in and targets the insult. Did OP mean to be insulting? I'm sure not. That doesn't mean the insult isn't there.  Either of your other examples read the same: a frumpy, home-schooled mess indicates that home-schoolers dress like messy frumps. It's a little more harsh to target a religious group that views plain dress as an act of worship and submission."

I am constantly on the verge of unsubscribing from this sub due to so many posts with, frankly, ugly results. A lot for posts are poorly-done, half-assed projects that no sane person would want.
