u_cloudao_io,ffhclf2,t1_ffh979z,1579929952.0,It’s a gtx 1080ti and at the weekly rate that’s $3588 a year. Well over the cost of even a titan rtx.
pcgaming,fffccvm,t1_fffadzv,1579880846.0,"This really isn’t the solution. I’m sorry but nothing rated for children should require parental supervision. Just like a movie if it’s rated for kids I should be able to trust I can take my hands off for a few minutes and relax, now if it’s rated appropriately fine I either won’t let my kid watch an older rated movie or I’ll watch it with them or watch it first so I know what’s coming. But why even rate things if we are going to say kids need to be watched.

There is a huge gap between negligence and being able to trust a games rating.

And just not having access to money doesn’t change the allure and system of haves and have nots in a game. And to me it’s worrying that people don’t think or care about physiological manipulation.

Give this a watch and if it doesn’t make your skin crawl idk what to tell you. It’s one thing in adults but in a game rated for kids, no thank you."

pcgaming,ffdm2zg,t3_esv4xy,1579823774.0,"Here is why this isn’t a victory...

What really happened is they managed to get a bigger % of the cut, but still cash in on the people who didn’t want to adopt worse platforms. Yes steam is bigger they were always going to have sales there. The more there are the less people care that they have to wait for their game."
NintendoSwitch,ffd489d,t1_ffd0msc,1579813105.0,I too dislike the art style but the game is so good I don’t really dwell on it. Not throwing shade just my personal experience :)

gog,ffbk2k0,t3_espqoh,1579769040.0,"It’s not going to happen because it’s not about the money they make from their games. It’s about the money their platform (steam) makes. Steam putting a game even an old one, only weakens their platform and builds another up. If the games value was important they wouldn’t be free to play atm. It’s ALL about bolstering their new platform through their games. If the games are just an add for half like Alyx they will need steam for it, so just install it and play for free. Why get gog involved?"
vegan,ffbjdov,t1_ffbcw1n,1579768067.0,"I don’t. It’s just every other company who has no values other then their share price. I mean it’s got it’s happening but it’s a little heartbreaking they don’t care and are just profiteering.

Edit to be clear I’m not attacking your opinion."
gaming,ffaxelw,t1_ffaq1f9,1579746711.0,I actually disagree. I see most microtransactions as a problem. Mainly because the move to server based saves has basically moved free in game cheats or anything like it to a micro transaction. Want unlimited gold in the old sims? Type in the command. Want gold in the new mobile system? We will sell it to you for real money. Companies should not be selling convenience to play their game. But that’s just me.
NintendoSwitch,ff9sdwo,t3_escb7d,1579720188.0,"Gross. Fuck Nintendo. They pretend they are friendly but they are just like every other anti consumer company, they just try to skirt the line of good will for profit."
pcgaming,ff9l40w,t1_ff9jzu1,1579715283.0,I disagree. They made a lot of mistakes but honestly not hitting 1080p was big for some people. Maybe not the majority some.
pcgaming,ff9h835,t1_ff994al,1579712960.0,It’s still happening. Just game by game rather then console wide. All these games as a service are designed with online only drm. And the only reason they backed off used games is because they can still sell microtransactions to people who bought the game used.
pcgaming,ff9gucp,t1_ff92x9i,1579712725.0,"Power has absolutely been a problem. Baseline for xbone is 900p where on ps4 it was 1080p. You may not mind, but scaling looks really bad, so hitting a displays native resolution is important."
pokemon,ff8j1kb,t1_ff88odn,1579680747.0,"I think sales and popularity are not the same thing. There are 2 factors I think you are ruling out. 1 the release of hgss was in the hay day of ds piracy, that’s how I originally played them. And the other one is the used market. I did eventually buy a used copy of the games. And word of mouth. These games have been found later by a lot of people through word of mouth. I also don’t think they had much time on the shelves as it was only a year till gen 5, oras got 2, and continues to be sold digitally."

gaming,ff3xpfx,t1_ff3qkpq,1579551133.0,People get mad because other views and story’s are under represented. Which has some merit but I think it’s changed a lot. Sure it’s probably the most common kind of game but there are now more options then ever previously.
Guelph,ff3wwiv,t1_ff3sev8,1579550628.0,Tbh I’ve never thought releasing identities before conviction was a good idea. What purpose does it serve? If it’s dismissed you risk still doing damage to the persons reputation. If it does end in conviction you could just release that info then. It’s impossible to be totally unbiased and I think it’s unfair to defendants to be at the mercy of the media’s portrayal.
pcmasterrace,ff3jx8f,t1_ff307wd,1579542629.0,This cracked me up... I might be a child.
gaming,ff2iscb,t1_ff2fqgl,1579507994.0,It’s a weird one. But I found because the game was more linear the combat encounters were more designed. The combat to me felt more engaging. Witcher 3 can be but it’s so easy to just plain hack and slash through.
gaming,ff2fitv,t3_er6cjj,1579503973.0,I'd urge people to play witcher 2. I think in many ways it's tighter then witcher 3. it's got quite a few issues but if your into the series and never gave it a shot please look into it :)
pcgaming,ff2fajr,t3_eqzw6h,1579503710.0,"I have no sympathy for most of them. This is the cost of ""trust"". DON'T TRUST COMPANIES. Their sole purpose is to separate your money from you, not be nice, not offer a good service, nothing. Some do more then just cost money, but it's their man goal. So when google figures it can get beta testers to pay for the chance what are they going it do? On the other hand mark my words none of the complaining right now will matter one little bit when it goes free to access. Mainstream consumers don't dig into reviews. youtube promoting their store and giving streamers and content creators kick backs will smooth all this over in a few days tops. Personally i don't want streaming and id rather it die so it doesn't eat the industry. But there is no chance streaming just dies, if google can do just half what it promised no one will care."
pcmasterrace,ff203t5,t1_ff1z30m,1579490258.0,Haha fair. I haven’t played in ages. I tried it on an old dual core back around launch.
pcmasterrace,ff1yojr,t3_er5xfg,1579489231.0,“Good” I wouldn’t say so but everything is relative. The integrated graphics on this are not very good. It will struggle to maintain 1080p60 in most of these games. Rust especially I think needs beefy hardware to have the settings up at all.
pcgaming,ff0ispm,t1_fez1vqn,1579469246.0,"Tbh This will probably translate to me never buying their games. I’m probably not their target audience anyways because I buy most games once they are discounted. So to essentially wait 2 years to play their game will probably just mean I lose interest. Especially since spoiler casts and what not will be done after the initial ps release. Idk I think it’s generally a good thing, but won’t really capture my interest."

Also the animals on your plate are not hunted they are factory farmed. And if you really think they are a-okay contact your local government and tell them to push back against making it illegal to film their living and butchering conditions. If it’s all above board why hide it right?

Tbh I’m not really worried about trying to convert people. I think we live in a world where it’s so easy to live without harming animals anyone doing so is actively making that choice. I’ll be polite in person, but this.... this is a vegan subreddit this is our safe place to vent about all the bullshit and hypocrisy and I’ll not filter myself here for people like you who care so little about animals or the environment, they can’t make a dietary change.

It’s the old one death is a murder 1000 is a statistic conundrum.

At the end of the day do what you choose but you won’t convince me to support it, or think positively about it. You have decided in a world where you can eat quite well without hurting an animal that you care so little about that animal that you won’t give up meat. Being vegan is fucking easy. I switch cold turkey because my wife wanted to try it. If it was more difficult or I was unhealthy or something I wouldn’t make this argument but access to alternatives are vast plentiful and easy to obtain. It’s like when extreme religious people let someone die because they don’t want to use modern medicine. Well we have all the tools to not hurt animals you could be better then the fire, and unlike the fire you have freedom of choice and control. You are worse then the fire because of intent. And w/e do what you choose but know you willingly have animals suffer and put to death. If you can look at that stomach that and keep doing it fine, but I won’t ever support you in that."
vegan,fesrlmc,t1_fesi77k,1579368285.0,"Aside from the torture of burning to death it’s no different to the animal. Would you rather die in a natural disaster, get turned into food, or not die. PROBABLY not die."
linux_gaming,fescgng,t1_fes0tny,1579363819.0,"The Linux is like Canada tweet isn’t that old. It’s not like it was from years and years ago. It’s from 2018. He changed his tone, It’s reasonable that people didn’t hear about it. But you are right looking into it more recently he has taking a slightly different stance. But throwing 25k at Lutris doesn’t really impress me. It’s less then 1 persons salary for a year. The donation isn’t a bad thing but it’s not really any sign of a strong commitment. The same way Walmart donating $100k to a charity doesn’t make them a key player In cancer research. 

Tbh so far it’s mostly just talk. With all development I’ll take a wait and see approach as we have no system in place to discourage lying or failure to meet spoken intentions.

But hopefully things go well :)

I admit I strongly dislike Tim Sweeney, but if he has changed his mind on linux and isn’t discouraging the companies he leads from supporting it that’s great to hear, but I’d have more confidence if they were independent. That’s across the board not just and epic or Tim thing. I just have more faith in a private companies ability to keep its promises because they don’t have shareholders to appease with quarter to quarter decision making."
linux_gaming,fervo2u,t1_feq1ayz,1579358830.0,I mean I’m going based off his statements not just assuming the worst. If he wasn’t on twitter talking down Linux gaming I wouldn’t have even said anything. Seems more like he changed his tune.

So me research suggests that routers just get shitty when left on for long times. Idk if they are low quality or what but apparently they are just better to be power cycled and start fresh as much as possible. So I went into my settings and set an auto restart so now it reboots every day at 6am before my wife wakes up and after I go to bed (work nights). It’s why any time you call an isp to diagnose an issue the first thing they say is restart the modem. 

Currently I use carrytel. I went with them because of price and the experience was so bad in my apartment that I just had no hope of getting a good experience and just figured I’d go where the best price and “advertised” performance. So I switched from Teksavvy dls (bell lines) to carrytel cable internet (Rogers lines) and it’s been really good. But sadly there are so many variables it’s really difficult to make a good/informed choice. I’ve had really good experiences on Rogers lines but location really matters.

4 I think their modem is mostly fine but I recommend getting your own router and setting it to power cycle every day at some point while you sleep. I’d also suggest doing a wifi diagnostic and setting a static wifi channel.

My personal experience was mostly decent until the fact that there was an issue with my dsl. Now I can’t rule out that my apartment building was the problem. But they also wouldn’t send a tech out to fix it. I spent months back and forth replacing every price of the puzzle and the customer support people aren’t techs and refused to listen to logic other then the set script which they put me through 4 times.

But instead this game with potentially game fixing dlc is $130(cad). Vs older more generous games which were 39.99 or 49.99. What they have is mostly good but they worst cut wasn’t any of the Pokémon, it was adventure and exploration. A version of this game where routes aren’t 8 feet long with an obvious path and no navigation would be amazing.

fuckepic,fekrxw1,t1_feket8v,1579206356.0,I was only referring to currently. In the wii era it was motion controls and the casual market. The wii u was just a miss but they did try to do something unique it just wasn’t great and didn’t catch on
fuckepic,fekc35a,t1_fek8lqn,1579196931.0,Portability.
fuckepic,fejbbec,t1_fej6gf3,1579165367.0,"Couldn’t agree more. You need to compete with what is available or do something different. Nintendo lost the performance war, they didn’t cry they looked for a different niche. Gog doesn’t have the features of steam and no one complains, because it’s lack of drm makes it effectively unteathered from their client."
gaming,feiznvr,t1_feigfrc,1579151800.0,Steam is the only auto start I have so that I can just hit the button and I’m home stream if I want.
vegan,fehhtzd,t1_fehe2u9,1579116833.0,"While I agree with you I think the distinction is that we don’t put them to work, especially in a way that is bad for them. I have one dog that would never leave, and I have no guilt keeping her forever. She just wants love and it’s great. I have another dog that would probably be more happy in the wild idk if she would come back if she broke free. BUT just letting her free would mean we risk her getting injured or just being picked up by the human society.

Idk I think there is a conversation to be had, but I also think some animals love it. Sadly there just isn’t a place for them the roam free in moderns society, and it’s one thing to stop consuming animal products and another to give up every modern convenience to restore the forests.

An example I would put forward is my old coworker telling me what dogs are like in India. They are hungry and mean and people literally abuse them to scare them off from attaching people. Idk I’m sure my one dog would love to run free but maybe not at the cost of going hungry for long times and getting smacked around if approaching humans."
pcgaming,fehh02c,t3_ep473o,1579116349.0,"Not in my wheel of interests but congratulations on finishing your game :)

Call me if you make an rpg ;)
Keep doing your thing!"
science,fehgeee,t1_feh954s,1579115998.0,"I can’t help but wonder how you get that number. The US has such a problem with low income health care that I’d bet countless people die undiagnosed because they can’t even afford to visit a doctor and find out they have cancer. However the highest treated survival rates, that I buy. When your medical system is so expensive it’s no surprise the best doctors work in your country, and by ruling out poor people everything looks great."
science,fehfxcz,t3_ep1u04,1579115719.0,There is no problem here this is capitalism working as intended. Not really the perfect system eh? Unless you’re rich then fuck everyone else right?
gifs,fehb15j,t1_feh6ho1,1579112860.0,Yup mine was really great off leash till the day she found a washed up fish. Once she knew I wasn’t the only potential source of food everything changed.
fuckepic,fehajf7,t1_feha7fc,1579112569.0,Agreed. Importing gog games to steam is the ultimate experience.
pcmasterrace,feg7hlz,t3_eozynv,1579080656.0,It would make sense if the 60hz slide just had the image moved back (because of the increased latency).
science,feg6eyg,t1_feg3xim,1579079139.0,You raise a very valid point.
AnthemTheGame,fefbp6v,t1_fefb6uf,1579052802.0,It’s weird because if I remember correctly I didn’t get the 100% cpu issue until after an anthem patch. But that was a while ago.
pokemon,fefagm9,t1_feexqey,1579051988.0,Lol “cave” you mean the holes in the sandbox?
