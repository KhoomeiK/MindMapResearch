I was in the nurse practitioners care for less than a half hour. It was my first visit to one of these, so she copied the data from my drivers license, got my phone number, asked me my height and weight (but measured neither, lacking those tools), looked in my ears and nose and throat. I had no fever, so she offered no diagnosis other than how I could deal with some moderate wax buildup in my ears. 

I have sketchy health Insurance where I work, so I have a sizable co-pay for such visits. I was billed $350 for that visit, and my out-of-pocket is $192. No fluid samples were taken, no blood or saliva or anything of the sort. Those would’ve been extra.
