kings,ffazguj,t3_esmmx2,1579748077.0,"I'm kind of disgusted in how this organization is ran as a whole. The franchise, at least under Vivek's ownership, is ran in such a contrarian fashion as though they need to feel smarter than everyone else and be surrounded by the yes men that allow them to feel that way. In the past decade they've feuded with and fired Mike Malone because they thought they knew better than him, mortgaged valuable draft capitol because they thought they were a piece away, only drafted players who worked out for them, then feuded with and fired Dave Joerger over passing on Doncic. It's an echo chamber not unlike the Washington Redskins, with ""very smart"" people who are in truth very dumb and no one around to tell them they are very dumb.
