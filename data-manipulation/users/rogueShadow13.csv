comics,ff4nrad,t1_ff4nk7o,1579568089.0,"That shit was brutal.  I did the same thing on my first play through when I had absolutely no idea what was going on.  I thought hard would be fun to play on. Spent atleast 2 hours if not more on the ship sequence.  Finally beat the level after days of trying. 
What type of sick bastard doesn’t put a save point in the whole first mission."
comics,ff3oi18,t1_ff3o8w7,1579545450.0,I agree. The hard mode seems to be the most fair of the difficulty levels. It punishes you but it’s some stupid impossible.
comics,ff3fe8k,t1_ff3fagh,1579539938.0,Play it on the higher difficulties. It’s insanely hard.  Top difficulty everything kills you in one shot.  The one below that is 2 shots.

ClashRoyale,fdkek42,t3_elgma8,1578502199.0,We had a clan member go inactive for awhile.  He was friends with some other people in our clan and they told us not to kick him because he was in prison for drug charges.  I left him in and he came back like 2 years later then mysteriously stopped talking again.  Later came to find out he OD'ed and passed away.  Roughest clan chat I have ever had.
