wholesomememes,fciutll,t1_fcit23u,1577670334.0,"Some of the anti-asexual arguments I've seen tend to mention that asexual people don't face discrimination or hate crimes because of it (which is not true). Or some people just don't think asexuality is ""gay"" enough. Some other people argue that it isn't part of LGBT+ because it isn't really a sexuality, it's an absence of one. Some people say asexuality isn't really a thing, and it's just straight people trying to be special, or people who are still in the closet. 

Asexuality and bisexuality are both kinda rejected by some people of the LGBT+ community. Personally, I think anyone who isn't cisgender or strictly heterosexual should 100% feel included, and allies welcomed. But I can see why some people want to be more exclusionary. I think some people do it out of a sense of self righteousness, but there are some people who genuinely just want a safe space among people they feel similar to."

You can Google the typical dimensions of your usual shoe size for comparison."
