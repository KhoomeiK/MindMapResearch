I, personally, would think something like an RTS would be more difficult because every aspect weaves into one goal rather than each existing separately and parallel (like an RPG). Fighting games would be similar, but the amount of potential variations to account for is lower since the roster of fighters is fairly limited."

unpopularopinion,fgf41z9,t3_exxl1c,1580723268.0,"How is, ""Jesus Christ!"" used in a derogatory way? It's an exclamation similar to, ""Holy Shit"" ""Whoa"" or ""What the fuck?!"" The exclamation has nothing to do with the origin of the actual words, it's just an expression. And like the above examples, it doesn't make any real sense to say, it's just said anyway and understand by most.


Also, respecting gender pronouns is not the same as adhering to someone's religious beliefs. If I asked you to call me Bob instead of Sarah, I would not then be required to go to Mass with you because you did something for me. One has to actually believe in the religion for ""Taking the Lord's name in vain"" to be applicable, but one does not need to do anything else to understand that I prefer a different way of being addressed."

AskReddit,ffu7i4i,t3_ev5zdg,1580236118.0,"A few months ago I was feeling very overwhelmed with the sheer amount of responsibilities I've been juggling and ended up crying before bed because I had only three hours to sleep to go back to my 12 hour job for the fourteenth day in a row. On top of the errands and chores at home. 


Normally, I prefer to be stressed and constantly solving problems, but if I don't let myself have a day or two every few months to set it all down, I'll break down."
intj,ffq2x2h,t3_eu844h,1580117458.0,"The majority of my stresses as a child dealing with other children came from my inability to be like them, to think like them. As a kid, I *wasn't* smarter than everyone else as I measured ""smart"" by how clever you were or how much you knew. So by virtue of being a heavily sheltered and naive kid, I was dumber than most. 

It look a long time to realize I was a natural architect of systems. My mini obsessions of recording, categorizing, analyzing, and manipulating information had always seemed like I was just trying to keep up, to know what everyone else probably already knows, but in reality I was sprinting far ahead. Intellectually, at least. Naturally, I fell behind socially, and while I felt left out a bit, I eventually figured out that there's a million ways to live and more than one way of being smart. 

Now, as an adult, I can feel comfortable with myself and my ""INTJness"" to the point that I can put it in the background for the sake of brief social interactions. And thankfully I have a wife (ENFP) who adores my ways. Though I don't always put it away either as I care about truth so much that being barbed and immovable is an acceptable image. People appreciate that integrity.

So, in essence, my INTJ personality *requires* I be a certain way to be happy and that way is definitely not a popular way of being. But, it isn't mandatory that I be happy constantly, so learning to deal with *both* situations is how an INTJ should mature.

That and getting a S.O and friends who love you for who you are. That's important."

I'm a writer by hobby and most of my stories are short ones with ""cool"" premises and satisfying (to me) endings. 

I also agree that anime is a great vehicle for premise stories as we innately have a strong suspension of disbelief for that particular medium. I was just talking to my wife about this the other day. That cartoons and anime have so much potential to tell *better* stories than live action ones because of how few limitations there are."
AskMen,ffh0phk,t1_ffh09my,1579919986.0,"A premise story is basically, ""What if this happened and this person had to do a thing?"" 
And then they just wing the rest of it without too much planning.

Like, ""What if the hero of a fantasy novel was really an evil necromancer killing big baddies with help so he can raise an army of undead big baddies?""

It does not say anything about *how* intelligent a person is, merely how well they do on a test that measures an aspect of intelligence within a given population.
