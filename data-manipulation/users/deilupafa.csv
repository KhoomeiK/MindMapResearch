AZCardinals,ffnwg4x,t1_ffjxqt9,1580071624.0,"True. But as a Wide Receiver you can't even have YAC if you can't even catch the ball in the first place.

That's what makes Larry special to me.

Remember all the bad QBs we had, and remember how Larry was always the go to guy.

Is a linebacker coming from your blind side and you need to dump it off to the most reliable hands in the league? Then you toss is to Larry and watch him run away.

Odell is known for 1 catch, yet Larry has made 1000s and has only dropped 29.

He made terrible QBs look average, and made average QBs better, and made our best QB ever into a legend.

Larry is the type of person that you need to learn from because that's how valuable he is, and for that, he is the best to ever do it."

It shows another level of respect and maturity for the game, sports in general, and life.

The guy is the best in the league"
suns,ffducbg,t1_ffdkyj6,1579829133.0,"I remember watching a game a while back ago, and I remember I was hearing EJ talk about the other team with so much respect that I actually felt proud to have such a fantastic guy on our side.

Whoever decided to put him in the booth deserves a good amount of praise as well"
