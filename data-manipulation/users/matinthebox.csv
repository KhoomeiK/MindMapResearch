https://www.europeanlawmonitor.org/eu-legal-principles/eu-law-what-is-the-principle-of-proportionality-a-subsidiarity.html

Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. (Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union)

What this means in practice is that the European Commission must justify the relevance of any proposals against the principle, and in fact, when proposals go to the European Parliament committees it is one of the first tests they consider.

If you feel that a proposal is just another example of over regulation, i.e. it is entirely disproportionate, then you may have strong grounds for opposing it on the grounds of proportionality.

https://europeanlawblog.eu/2013/07/16/pomfr-proportionality-analysis-and-models-of-judicial-review/

Proportionality is a legal principle that allows (or requires) balancing between competing values. This enables judges to decide whether a measure has gone beyond what is required to attain a legitimate goal and whether its claimed benefits exceed the costs. Originating most clearly in German 19th century administrative law, proportionality has become a standard feature of constitutional analysis: since the Second World War it has gradually spread worldwide.[1] With the work of in particular Robert Alexy a common theoretical framework has become available.[R. Alexy, A Theory of Constitutional Rights (translated by J. Rivers) (Oxford Univrsity Press, New York 2002).] Yet at the same time the way in which proportionality is actually applied varies widely  not just between jurisdictions, but within them. For instance, instead of strict balancing between values a necessity test is often applied.[Cf W. Sauter, Proportionality in EU Law: A Balancing Act?
