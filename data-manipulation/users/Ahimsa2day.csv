Winnipeg,ffbrm6n,t3_ervjk9,1579780033.0,"I agree with the others that say you should enjoy some time in the city. 
Just a heads up though, if you’re traveling connecting thru to the USA you’ll be leaving the secure area & have to go through security & US customs again so make sure you leave time for that one the end. 
One more suggestion- by May, [the Trolley car tours](https://winnipeg.tours/city-tours/)  of Winnipeg are up & running until the fall. That’s a good all over snapshot tour of Winnipeg"

If you find any good Indian/Pakistani food store or supplies shop with cooking stuff they have them for a lot less. They also stack. Or look up “tiffin” online. All they are doing are buying tiffins and quadrupling the price. Lol 
They’re great for stacking and taking to work/school"

You live in a very bad area of the city, in a  dangerous area Something happened to your family, a tragedy, massive financial loss, Disease, something that by no fault of their own has devastated them. You are heartbroken. Your family is broken. You’re extremely worried about your younger siblings. By some miracle you meet a older man whom you fall in love and marry! You discover he is wealthy and now he is saying that “you’ve both discussed it’s better not to give money to them”  um....something is stinky in Denmark and it’s not the cheese! Even &200 a month would be. HUGE amount! That’s what he probably spends on his lattes a month. So give me a break. You’d expect your husband to help"
