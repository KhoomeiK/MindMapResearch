Pete_Buttigieg,ffdoye6,t1_ffdlg9m,1579825534.0,"The idea he ""planned"" this is so absurd as to be hilarious.

Besides, I'll have a harder time getting into the CIA if I'm out."""
Pete_Buttigieg,ffd8syl,t1_ffd5f5d,1579815664.0,Oh I agree. I think it would be an unsubstantial accusation. I'll be happy if it doesn't come up. I just know things start to get nasty after Iowa.

If you were very exposed to Yang's platform, but most  of what you knew of Buttigieg came from his debate performances, I could see why you might come away thinking they were more dissimilar than they are. If you look at Pete in his long form interactions, I think you start to see more of their similarities.

Certainly not trying to recruit here. I respect Yang and the whole Yang Gang.

You will certainly find many of us fawning over Pete from time to time, but as a recovering Bernie supporter and from growing up in a fundamentalist environment, I know what a cult feels like, and Pete is cult antidote.

Free speech is exactly why this is so gnarly. It is a foundational pillar of our democracy, but with the advent of the internet it allows foreign powers an opportunity to use it against us in a way never before seen. Once they arm citizens with their (dis)information of choice, there's no legal mechanism to stop it from spreading. I'm not advocating for a reduction of free speech, but our democracy will become less and less effective until we find a way to deal with this problem.

You want to know why it matters? I work in IT. Good, smart people fall prey to phishing schemes all the time. As humans, we are vulnerable to misinformation, especially when it has the opportunity to come at us from every angle, every hour of the waking day, multiplied by the advanced tactics available to practiced teams of information analysts employed for the express purpose of deceiving people.
