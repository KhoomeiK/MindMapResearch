You go from being at the whims of whatever randomness your brain can think up, to a half conscious realization that you're dreaming and none of this is real. And from that point on you're still sleeping and you can't control every little thing but you can guide what is happening.

We follow them as part of the story so see them all the time, and see how they use the force, but the vast majority of the galaxy had never met a jedi and quite possibly not even met someone ELSE who met a jedi. Even when they did, they rarely saw them actually use the force, it was just something you heard second or third hand from soldiers in the Republic armies, and could easily dismiss as exaggerations.
