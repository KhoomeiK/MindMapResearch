You then play on the media’s coverage of Trump’s reaction to the disaster to make it seem like you don’t have enough water/supplies for everyone. That story gets played on every news outlet in America. Americans everywhere write their elected representatives and demand that PR receive more relief funds. Then, one of three things could happen.  The first, the Trump admin gives more money to try to stop the news cycle. The second, enough support in the legislative branch to push more financial aid to PR. And third, the Administration says no and there’s not enough public support to get more funding. 

Scenario 1 or 2 happens, you “buy” those supplies you hid from yourself and distribute them. You get a tidy little profit. 

Scenario 3 happens, you hide all the aid and hope nobody finds it. 

The Donald people have their tin foil hats on claiming that PRs leadership did this to make Trump look bad. In reality, they knew that framing it as an anti trump protest would draw mass media coverage and energize the American public in their support.

WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3p2g6,t1_ff3bzw6,1579545796.0,"The VP position in America is curious in the way the public perceives it. I’d wager the average American doesn’t really know what the VP does on a daily basis. 

The VP is generally perceived as a kind of sidekick to the President. Biden was the Robin to Obama’s Batman in a way. To most, he was only really thought about when he was interacting with Obama in a charming way. Not many were concerned with his actual stances on issues. 

Now that he’s campaigning as a presidential candidate, people are beginning to see him in the light. He doesn’t look great in the light, digging into his voting history is rough, looking at the legislation he’s authored, also rough. He has a very “I know everything” attitude that turns a ton of young voters off of his campaign. He embodies the “boomer” attitude even though he’s from the generation before the boomers. 

His gaffes were charming when he was Obama’s sidekick, but now they’re just embarrassing. It’s hard to tell if his senility is confusing him, or if it’s letting some subtle racism leak through. The famous “Poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids” line comes to mind. In a period in America where most young voters are fed up with old white men making all the decisions, he is the oldest and whitest candidate. 

But, worst of all, most people think he’s going to lose the election to Trump if he’s the presidential candidate. His selection as the nominee will further enrage the progressives in the Democratic Party who think DNC politics kept Bernie out of the race last time. The problem here is that Bernie as a nominee doesn’t really split the voting base. A lot of bernie’s supporters are young progressives. Biden’s supporters are largely establishment democrats. Young progressives may vote independent or abstain to make a statement, establishment democrats are more likely to just vote along party lines. 

You’re also getting a skewed view of the American population on Reddit. Biden still has tons of support in America, it’s looking like he’s about tied with Sanders. The American population on reddit is young, progressive, and vocal. That demographic supports Bernie in a big way, thus the anti Biden sentiment of reddit."

Lots of marketing grads I see come straight out of college into “event marketing” jobs. In most cases these pay very little, involves little actual marketing, and are generally... rough. 

If you’re considering a career in marketing right now, the most valuable thing you’ll learn is outside of the degree. Study enhanced content, UI/UX, e-commerce marketing. Those skills are gold on a resume, because it’s something that’s not widely taught in academic settings, and it’s new enough that most senior marketing people don’t really have a ton of experience with it. Every marketing student wants to do the fun side of marketing. They want to make commercials or do social media marketing. I sit in tons of marketing interviews a year, I constantly hear that. Marketing is a blend of analytics and art, treat it seriously and you can make a hell of a career out of it. Treat it like most do and you’ll end up sitting at a table at events for a few years, then maybe you’ll be writing social posts.

worldnews,fdkufd0,t1_fdktz7u,1578511375.0,If there is a “real investigation”. Any investigation by Iran themselves is suspect just due to the circumstances. They’re not going to give the black box or access to the wreckage to Americans. About the best bet is they let the Ukrainians see it.
worldnews,fdktwsh,t1_fdju48a,1578511074.0,"The shitty thing is that Iran probably won’t be coughing up any more details about this, and the chances of an independent investigation are slim. So what we really have to go on is the footage we’ve seen, the actual wreckage on the ground, and the circumstances surrounding the crash. 

That means nobody can make a 100% determination, individuals will have to look at the evidence presented and any expert testimony that comes out to make their decision. 

So far we know that there was a catastrophic event that killed all systems and resulted in a no control descent and the aircraft breaking up mid air. We also know there was an extremely large fire. 

From the pictures of the wreckage we know there is shrapnel damage to the aircraft. This could mean a few things, a carried on explosive device, a catastrophic failure that lead to a detonation of the fuel tanks, or a SAM strike. Looking at the shrapnel patterns on the fuselage is also telling, we can see a fairly regular shape for damage in multiple places. This is inconsistent with a catastrophic failure, accidental explosives rarely throw uniform shrapnel, whereas a SAM strike would have consistent shrapnel damage. The impact patterns of the shrapnel that have been seen so far also indicate a detonation below and to the starboard of the aircraft. This is inconsistent with an internal explosion, but consistent with a SAM strike. 

Aside from physical evidence, we do have a fair amount of circumstantial evidence. First, the Iranian government issued a statement very quickly claiming a technical issue caused the crash. Another Iranian statement said that it was an engine fire, and if it had been hit by a missile it “would’ve exploded in the air”. The Ukrainian Embassy issued a statement in support of that, and then later retracted that statement. Later on, the head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said there was no evidence pointing to technical failures yet. Second, the odds of a plane crash are shockingly low, The Economist put the probability of a plane crash at 1 in 5.4million. They happen, but it’s exceedingly rare. A catastrophic failure of this magnitude though? Even rarer. Third, the area the aircraft went down in is likely the hottest flight zone in the world right now. We know the Iranians were prepared for US retaliation by air, and that their AA systems are not advanced by current standards. Put this plane crash anywhere else in the world, and the sheer extent of the damage to the aircraft would be pretty shocking. Put it in an area where SAM sites are active and on high alert, and a SAM strike becomes plausible. 

The OPS Group, an organization of Airline specialists, put out the following statement: 

“We would recommend the starting assumption to be that this was a shootdown event, similar to MH17 – until there is clear evidence to the contrary”.

I don’t think we’ll ever get an actual answer to this. All we can do is look at the limited evidence we have and form some sort of opinion. The evidence we have leads me to believe that there’s a high probability this was a SAM strike. Other people will look at the same evidence and say something else."
