mildlyinteresting,ffj2na4,t3_etw8ks,1579988847.0,I already hung out in a box as a kid.  It wasn’t that great.
AskReddit,ffj1o9m,t3_etttdp,1579988152.0,"Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry.  It’s my favorite.  It’s a sweeping western with great characters and a good story.  The prequels/sequels are good as well, but it’s the best."
AskAnAmerican,ffiyss7,t3_etu00f,1579986060.0,"Flooding.  The town floods 2-4 times a year.   They’ve spent millions to figure out the problem. Somehow it’s because the river is full of crap and it flows south and gets backed up.   Some people took it upon themselves to clean out the creeks on their properties and that’s helped.  If it gets to our last big ones record (in 07), the bridges are closed and you can’t get across town.   
It’s just an annoyance for me."
