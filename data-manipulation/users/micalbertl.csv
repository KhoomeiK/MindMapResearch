worldnews,fdeoz5p,t1_fdeom73,1578343601.0,You are missing the point. They don’t know what being a boy or girl or man or woman is yet. Half of them don’t even know what the other genitals are yet. A 14 year old is a lot different than an 8 year old. They aren’t old enough to know. Look into the statistics on gender change reversals and early age hormone treatments.
worldnews,fdeojur,t1_fdeog6n,1578343357.0,That at 8 years old your body hasn’t even developed yet so how is anyone supposed to know it’s not the one they are comfortable in
worldnews,fdeo03r,t1_fdenidi,1578343036.0,"See now you nutted up to call me a bigot. Trans kids and people are definitely real. I was making the point that there is an age that is too young to make a decision for the rest of your life. Would you let an 8 year old get married? Are you saying kids don’t experience love? 

Be reasonable. Life is not the polar extremes the media makes it out to be. The proper solutions lie in between those extremes. Almost nothing in this universe can be defined in absolutes."

DonutMedia,fcqtw19,t3_eihq2u,1577892132.0,4x4 means it is part time awd. Meaning it is rwd until you turn on 4wd. It’s a different system due to less differentials. If you use it on road you will get lots of binding
