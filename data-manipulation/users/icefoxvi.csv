facepalm,fffd2gt,t3_et85ze,1579881291.0,"I love when they use the term ""peer reviewed"" when referring to antivax information. Cracks me up every time. If I get my roommate Richard to read my insane ramblings that counts too doesn't it?"

Miniaturespainting,fely5ds,t3_epv2ec,1579233917.0,"Found that living in an Alpine desert makes paint dry too fast. Waitress is a bit goopy and has too many layers. I also only had two washes at the time so she just looks dirty. First boy was chunky so I had more paint on the brush, turned out nice. Need advice on faces. These zombicide figures don't have many details on most faces and are super tiny. Thoughts?"

HazbinHotel,fejzpua,t3_epivzi,1579189499.0,Uranus is named for the god Ouranos (oh-RAN-ose). I hope whoever fucked that up gets poked in the ass by demons every time this joke is made. Even when they tried to insist a different pronunciation of Urine-us they still fucked it up.
aliens,fejy4t4,t1_fejtyrm,1579188504.0,"Literally anything. I am so frustrated by the amount of video, photo and anecdotal evidence in contrast to the lack of hard evidence. There's something out there and even if it's just assholes in suits I wanna know."

aliens,fedy7bu,t3_eom7ok,1579022394.0,"It looks like it could be a large plane with countershading and the landing lights on. The small light moving back and forth could be the tail light when the craft changes it's pitch. There also looks to be wingtip lights that become hidden at the same time. It is unexplainable that the plane looks otherwise invisible, especially for the distances between the lights to change that drastically implies it is at low altitude or huge. However, digital compression pretty much guarantees that what we see here isn't what was there."
