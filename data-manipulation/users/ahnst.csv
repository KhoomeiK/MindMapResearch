Then summon the bot with a warlock (accepting summon is same location as well). Then you have someone in the party start accruing dks with the bot in the party.

ENFP,ff54e8r,t1_ff4zb0w,1579579912.0,"What I do is come with an attitude that I know nothing.  Yes I'm educated, yes I read, yes I try to keep up with subject matters that interest me. But there will always be people that know more than me, and everyone I meet may provide an insight that I never thought of.  Opportunities to learn can come from anywhere and anyone. When debating with someone, its not about ""I know more than you,"" its more about understanding why someone thinks a certain way, and growing your understanding of how people think. (and obviously you can learn about subject matters from the content itself if it is something you have less knowledge of). When you take this approach to debates/arguing, that's when it becomes more of an exercise in learning. (side note - i prefer the term argument/arguing.  Because people take such a confrontational approach to it, it has gotten a negative image, but classically an argument was a discussion of an idea from two different viewpoints). 

Secondly, arguments become heated when one person feels like they are not being understood/ feel like they are being attacked. That's when the argument can become confrontational and more difficult to get back on track. By taking the approach of ""oh so why do you think that way?"" You can learn to go deeper into the circumstances that led to that train of thought. And people will appreciate the fact that you are really trying to listen to them and understand where they are coming from. And sometimes, if there is a flaw to their logic, its easier to point it out at the root.  This also works the other way - many times I have changed my view on things by exploring my chain of thought with the other person.

The next important thing is when bringing up counter-points is to use the ""I"" word a lot. ""I think,"" ""My thoughts,"" ""My experience,"" ""My understanding,"" etc. language and tone is important in arguments - and if you state something as a fact that's really an opinion, the argument can be derailed because then it devolves into verifying that ""fact.""  That just takes the focus away from the main point that you were trying to discuss in the first place. Using the ""I"" word keeps the other person on your side of trying to understand the issue vs. attacking each other.

Some examples:
In a meetup event I met a white older South African (this was not in America). During a conversation he went on talking about how he hated the black South Africans, how they were ruining the country, and how much South Africa got worse once apartheid ended.  

The wrong way to approach this would have been to lambast him as being racist and personally attacking him for holding such backward views. His response would probably have been to then try and defend himself and maybe even counterattack me. But that would not accomplish anything except perhaps the feeling of moral superiority on my side.

Instead I asked him why he thought that, what events he experienced to come to those conclusions (this was a genuine curiosity - it was an opportunity to learn about the social unrest in South Africa from someone who lived there). He then opened up to me about different experiences, but the one I remember most was when he talked about how the black South Africans were ruining the train system. During apartheid, sections were divided (first class, 2nd, etc) and everything ran in an orderly fashion. However, now, it was a mad chaotic free-for-all. People rushing into seats, people not paying, people ""acting like savages"" on the train, which led to ruining the whole rail transportation system for everyone.

My response was ""hmm... I may not agree with your conclusion, but I understand why these experiences have led you to create this viewpoint."" (side note - understanding someones point of view is not the same as condoning their point of view. You can understand why and how Hitler came to power - doesn't mean you support that he did).  I then spoke with him about my experiences in the Peace Corps.  I recalled how many projects in the Peace Corps that were started by the volunteers, while successful when the volunteers were there, fell apart as soon as the volunteers left. Unfortunately some volunteers walked away with the conclusion that these people were just too lazy to help and would never be able to be lift themselves out of poverty.  However, my realization was different. I realized that in America, we are taught a lot about leadership. We are taught how to take initiative from a young age. In my Peace Corps country, young kids in these rural schools were not taught that. They were just taught to follow orders because they would only grow up to become laborers. And laborers are just taught to follow orders. If true development was to take place, it would have to be a multi-generational endeavor to teach and nurture kids into developing that sense of leadership and initiative. I then related this to the events in South Africa - was it not possible that the black South Africans, after years of being kicked down and marginalized, have yet to adjust to the changes? And that the changes would be gradual? 

His response was that he never thought of it that way, and it visibly seemed that his views on them had softened - he became very contemplative of it. Of course I'm not deluding myself to believe that he became a champion of black rights in South Africa, but I like to believe that he became more empathetic to them instead of outright hate and disdain. And for me that was a big first step.

As an ENFP, I feel that we naturally enjoy engaging with people, and having an argument is no different. If someone has a viewpoint different from yours, its a great opportunity to learn more about the person and their experiences that led them to develop that train of thought.  One of my most memorable conversations/arguments was on a plane ride with an older conservative women. Somehow our conversation steered towards the topic of abortion, and we went back and forth exploring why we thought the way we did (she was pro-life and i took the pro-choice position). It was a great hour long conversation and as we landed, we thanked each other for having such a nice civil discussion of the event, with the ultimate conclusion that where you stood on the issue depended on your priorities. And that different people had different priorities. There was no winner or loser, just a very nice discussion between two people who had different points of view."
ENFP,ff41ut9,t1_ff3cbck,1579553719.0,"The point of a debate shouldn’t be to have someone adopt your views. Once you get past the idea of “winning” a debate, it opens up a lot more possibilities and positivity. 


The point of a debate should be to make the other person understand (not agree) your point of view, and for you to try to understand the other person’s point of view. Sometimes one person may realize that their point of view was wrong, but the general point should be to increase understanding for everyone involved."

The U.S. and British topple the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in the 50's because we didn't like the fact that he would nationalize Iran's oil fields rather than let the western powers keep leaching it off of them.  We put back in the shah to be our bitch. All we had to do was keep paying (via CIA) for pro-shah riots. So it looks like we got a sweet win in materials, right? For a few dollars, we get access to Iranian oil.

But look what it set up down the line - resentment towards Western Imperialism, which leads to the overthrow of the shah and the replacement with anti-western theocracy. This anti-western theocracy was a direct result to our interference in their country. And now look at the mess we're in with them. 

so short term we won Iranian oil (for a few decades). Long term we're constantly at the stage of war with Iran, and Iran obviously isn't leaving our presence in the Middle East alone.

Look - all banter aside. If you don’t watch porn I commend you because you have more self restraint than the vast majority of men. If you do watch porn, you are being hypocritical because you are supporting the industry that encourages people to sell pictures and videos of themselves. I took the gamble that you were in the overwhelming majority of men online that watch porn. I apologize if I was wrong. 

Ultimately, the fact of the matter is that sex work is a grey area. We can do nothing but act in good faith and keep a vigilant look out. Should women be encouraged to sell their bodies online? That’s a personal opinion. Should we encourage anyone to do anything, or should we all just mind our own business? If a woman decides she wants to post intimate photos of herself without any encouragement from anyone (as in this case),  we shouldn’t judge her for it. We may not approve, but her actions raised a shit load of money for a good cause. Why not applaud her for that? You can acknowledge that she did good without condoning how she did it. Like Robin Hood.  

To the overall issue - should women be encouraged to sell their bodies?  If they are in desperate straits, some would call that exploiting their situation which is a bad thing. But what if a woman is an exhibitionist, fine with showing her body, is not conservative about the topic of sex, actively enjoys it, and sees it as an opportunity to make a lot of money doing it? Shouldn’t she be able to do that without judgement?  

In this case it seems to be the latter. But obviously there are lots of cases of the former. Women being taken advantage of by their situation. And we need to be vigilant of that, and shut it down where it happens. 

However, who should be the gatekeeper? I’d say women. Women know what’s best for themselves. Men have fucked things up so many times when it comes to women’s rights that I don’t believe we get a say in this. Just look at Saudi Arabia or the Taliban. Let women decide what is right for themselves."

But I'm not holding my breath on that and will count on the likelihood that america will roll solo on this one.

With Iran specifying they have a problem w/ Trump and not americans, i think it will lead to economic warfare on his businesses if they play the short game. if not, they're just gonna play the long game and wait for the best time to strike, having us constantly look over our shoulders.

Im just hoping they will realize an attack on US soil will play into Trump's hands. maybe they'll wait to see if he gets re-elected until they decide to take action."

Unfortunately we won't know how this will affect things down the line. Kinda like when we took out their democratically elected prime minister in 1953. better to have someone to look after US interests than someone else. How could they have imagined back then how things would spiral later on.  Thing is they couldn't, so they just focused on immediate concerns.

My question is the wisdom of going after him in the first place.  We fucked things up first in Iran by getting rid of their democratically elected leader, and there has been long standing animosity brewing since (between the governments, not the people). Nothing we can do about that anymore. Now we've publicly shamed them and they're gonna have to try and save face, which many times leads people to do stupid things. 

A lot of faith is being put on a country's leaders to not act stupidly.  I'm more worried about what Iran will do down the line if they don't respond now. Because then we'll constantly have to be watching our backs."
worldnews,fdewmq9,t1_fdejq6r,1578348137.0,"Im not the one that downvoted you - im just trying to have a valid discussion.

Think the major difference is a) Obama killed someone directly responsible for 9/11. And if it was during George W's tenure that it happened, he would have been praised as well (at least for that part).   

b) Obama killed a stateless terrorist. No country was gonna back him up. If 9/11 was orchestrated by a general of a country, we definitely would have gone to war.  Soleimani is an Iranian general, and to think that Iran will not retaliate for killing him is foolishly optimistic.

c) Trump argued that the reason we had to kill Soleimani was because he was planning an immediate attack against the U.S. Evidence of which has yet to surface. And until it shows up I will continue to be pessimistic if it actually exists. Because George W took us to war on a lie, and thus I distrust any politician (democrat or republican) until they provide actual evidence. 

My stance is that we really don't need to go to war with Iran and President Trump is leading us very close to it with his actions.  If it was Obama doing it I would feel the exact same way.  Out of curiosity, what is your position? That we should be going to war? Or that we shouldn't be going to war but Trump's action was justified? Just so we're clear on what we're talking about."
