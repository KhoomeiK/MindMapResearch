There are a lot of unschooling and Montessori types that ALSO ascribe to free range children ideas, but they're different. Free range children refers more to heightened independence in daily functioning rather than formal education. So like, letting your 8 and 6 year old kids walk to and from the neighborhood park together without parental supervision. Sending kids outside with a rule to be back when the street lights go on.

I'm sure there are nuances and overlaps and everything is more complex then that, but many free range kids go to public school just like all the other kids out there. They just walk there by themselves."

ChildrenFallingOver,fergurx,t1_fer8mt6,1579353679.0,"Eh, there are good and bad aspects. My personal opinion is that it's a good thing for basic recreational soccer leagues where your skill level is going to be hugely diverse because it will protect children who are, quite frankly, clutzy uncoordinated imbeciles. You don't want someone with crazy good skills slide tackling someone who's never played before because they could both get hurt. Kid who has never played before won't understand how to fall, or jump, or be able to anticipate that a slide tackle is even a possibility. It can also be really intimidating to new players, especially if one team gets loaded with newbies and another get a loaded with super stars. You'll have a really scary and upsetting set of games of the superstars are slide tackling all over the place. Think that movie ""The Big Green."" And eventually you'll get newbies who get frustrated and try slide tackling without knowing what they're doing. Ultimately I think that basic rec leagues need to maintain maximum levels of accessibility and safety.

But for leagues like select, travel, rec plus, whatever you want to call it, I don't have the same opinion. Kids should be taught how to slide tackle safely and then allowed to do it. Its dangerous, sure, but I'm not convinced its hugely more dangerous than other things. And kids in these leagues are more likely to play competitively in school, etc. I personally think it's incredibly important to teach those kids how to slide tackle safely, how to anticipate and respond to a slide tackle safely, from a much earlier age. If you start when a kid weighs 65 lb and are much more rubbery it just seems better than trying to teach them at 165 lbs because they're more likely to get hurt.

Headers I think should be banned in all but the very most competitive older ages (like high school or college), but I think coaches should teach proper techniques starting around 10 or 12. Bad header technique can destroy your body. More and more science seems to be showing that even headers are dangerous to your brain. Coaches should focus in chest traps and how to do them safely, especially for girls as it gets awkward when you grow up, as a better alternative.

But that's my opinion and this is the internet, so what does anything really matter?"

Marriage,fe4rcge,t3_enhrcl,1578862062.0,"In my marriage, I also want to talk things out (to excess) and my husband usually ends up being overwhelmed to the point of shutting down. What we have learned is:

1. My husband has NO comfort with anything even resembling conflict, while I have a very high conflict threshold. My husband is an internal processor, I am an external processor. This all means that my husband can only talk through things for a very little while before he gets so emotionally overwhelmed that we don't make progress. I have learned, a) remain very calm when talking about problems and be conscientious about your own tone and word choice, b) expect to have many small conversations rather than one big one, and be genuinely ok taking a break when your husband reaches his limit even if its only been 15 minutes c) choose de-escalating posture and body language (so for us, its best not to face each other and usually we hold hands or snuggle while we have difficult convos), d) accept or even initiate short subject changes - these aren't always an avoidance tactic, sometimes this is your husband asking for a micro-connection to reassure himself you two are ultimately on the same team even if you're fighting right now (so for example, if you're arguing over who has do do house chores today and suddenly he says, ""I just noticed this spot on the wall looks like Michael Jackson moon walking,"" instead of being livid that he is changing the subject you should look at the spot and laugh about it together for a moment before redirecting to the problem at hand).

2. My husband's automatic assumption in any situation where we have a disagreement is that he is failing. I have learned, a) follow the practices of active listening (it's a whole thing, look it up), b) always use ""I statements"" to avoid accusatory language (another whole thing you should look up), c) begin most conversations with a positive spin, maybe by stating appreciation for his current efforts or progress you've seen in the area before, then use an ""and"" statement rather than a ""but"" statement (yet another thing to look up. Essentially it sounds like this, ""Hey, thanks for fixing the kids dinner! It's a lot of help, and in the future you can use these placemats under the dishes to help with cleanup!"" Instead of saying, ""but in the future you should"" or even worse... just ""Put placemats under the kids dishes when they eat. I hate all this cleanup when you don't!"")

Now I know what you're thinking. This a damn lot of work for what sounds like a fragile male ego problem! But I promise its not. Its actually just a human thing. Language is nuanced and crazy - we aren't usually even aware how one simple word can change the entire assumed meaning of what we say. And honestly these practices are awkward at first but you get the hang of them pretty fast if you try.

3. Human beings like being loved and appreciated. I've found that in order to have good fights my husband and I have to be pretty well stocked on positive interactions. There a a whole study out there that says something like, in order to be happy as a couple you need to have like 5 to 7 good interactions for every 1 bad one. So, TELL HIM THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! That's a good interaction and its an easy way to build up them good interaction points. Thank you for doing the dishes, for taking out the trash, for remembering to leave on time today, for picking up kids from daycare, for remembering to grab a kids toy on the way out the door, for working so hard every day, for going to the grocery, for playing with the kids all night... it might feel dumb at first to say thank you for something he should be doing anyway because they're not favors, but I'm telling you... it really helps future fights if you've spent all week telling him how much you appreciate him. And bonus - after a few weeks he'll probably start telling you the same!

4. My husband and I feel and express love in different ways. I highly recommend you guys look into love languages (warning: the guy who wrote it is Christian but you don't have to be Christian to find the concepts useful). I've learned that I need to be touched all the freaking time to feel fully loved, but my husband needs to do things together. It sounds like you may need touch as well. Its highly possible that, even if you've told him you need it, touch just isn't what makes your husband feel loved. He isn't intentionally trying to hurt you, it just hasn't clicked that, say, the way he feels when you give him a present is the way you feel when he gives you a hug. Maybe he's giving you presents (or words of affirmation, or acts of service, or whatever) all the time and you're like ""great ANOTHER candy bar. Where is my dang kiss hello??"" What has helped my husband and I is finding out each others love languages, making an effort to love each other in that way specifically, but also noticing when the other is acting out their own love language and appreciating it regardless of whether it does much for us.

5. My husband and I have communication problems because we are so different. We have learned to be kind but direct. When he needs to be alone he kindly says so. When I need to be told I'm pretty, I kindly ask him, ""I look pretty, don't I? I want to hear you say it!"" It is always best ask for what you need because hoping the other will notice is never going to work. Maybe you just want him to ""know you"" well enough to guess, but girl thats Lifetime Movie romance. Its not real. Real romance is when your spouse is stoked to meet your need even if they need to be told when and how to do it.

In the end I get that this all sounds like a lot of chores for you when your husband is the one with the problems, but trust me. You will never successfully get someone to change. You can't change them yourself, and even if you nag them into behaving differently that's just a bandaid. The only thing you can do is change how you act and how you react towards that person. Patterns of behavior take 2 people to set. If you disrupt the current pattern of interaction, you've already made change. It is likely that your husband will change his behavior on his own because now you guys have no pattern, so you have to create a new one. It sounds kind of manipulative but I personally don't think it is. The goal here isn't to get your husband to change, the goal is for you to change how you're interacting with him to a more healthy pattern for yourself (no more nagging or pressuring, speaking kindly and sensitively, being direct about your needs, learning to know yourself and your husband better.) Chances are the consequences will include a change in your husbands behavior, but that's not the goal.

Ultimately you guys would do well with couples therapy, but if that's too much money what I've done myself is just a lot of reading on relationships and how to communicate well. Look up psych papers on things like bids for attention, or the good interactions vs. bad ones thing, or the studies by the guy who can predict with crazy accuracy which couples will divorce. Look at TedTalks, check out books and audio books on marriage from your local library. Do a bunch of research on your own. It really does help."
Marriage,fe4dll2,t3_enqbbr,1578858148.0,"I'm so sorry. Your dad is abusive and controlling. The fact that you are afraid to let them fight without your involvement would indicate abuse. Normal, healthy parents in normal, healthy relationships do not fight with such intensity that their children (grown or not) need to step in to keep things from getting out of hand.

Even if he hasn't hit her, screaming and calling names is abuse, too. Making her live in fear (or you and your sister live in fear) of what he might do if you displeased him... that is abuse. Making her ""swear over"" her kids, although I don't really know exactly what you mean by that, is not normal behavior for a father or husband. Was this some way to threaten her with your safety, even without saying it directly I wonder? That is also abuse.

Checking her phone, sneaking to find out where she has been, getting so upset that she feels forced to hide your teachers names in her phone... those are all ways he is trying to control her. Where she goes, who she talks to, what she does. Its more than not trusting her, its your dad demonstrating that he thinks of your mom as his property, his pet, and much like he might control a dog he is acting as if he should control her. That is not a normal way to treat ones spouse. Healthy people don't act that way.

If any of you in your house are in danger, you need to get help. Look into shelters or organizations in your area that help battered women and children get out of abusive homes.


Human beings deserve dignity and respect. The way your dad treats your mom demonstrates neither of those things. It may seem not so bad to you, or like its just how things are, or like its survivable... but that's because you're so used to it you don't have a comparison to what it's like to be ok. Its just like how you can burn something in the kitchen and it stinks for a while, but eventually you think the smell went away. But if you leave your house to take out the trash, you'll smell the burn smell super strong all over again. The smell never went away... you just got used to living with it.

That's what is going on with your parents. Clearly your mom knows your dad's behavior stinks, and clearly you do, too, but its so normal to you know you can't tell how bad. This is one internet stranger telling you that the stink is really, really, really bad."

2. Keep it in a locked room and tell people you're working on your masterpiece, spend several hours a day in the room with the canvas to be convincing. 

3. Months later reveal your work - having painted not a single thing on it - as being done entirely in 1D lines. 

4. Wait for stupid rich people to hear about your amazing work.

5. Take the stupid rich people's money and BECOME the stupid rich people!

You have a group photo in military fatigues up on your pin board, so that's where I got the military from. It's not the kind of photo people put up unless there's a personal connection. I guessed your major based on the book on your windowsill for SPSS - I couldn't read any other titles or maybe I'd of been closer to the right major. XD I also made a guess on the corner of what looks like a flag on the top right of the photo. What flag is it really?

As to your eating habits... cereal bowl pushed to the side of your desk, coffee mug, water bottle, none look to be in active use. But! dishes are not piled up. It's dim looking out your window, so I figured it was a recent meal but not breakfast. Also eating at your computer indicates multitasking, so busy and not super concerned about eating properly ;P. The sticky notes everywhere also indicate busy... and forgetful. (Said by someone who's desk currently had 20 sticky notes on it.) You have makeup on one shelf and a pink soccer ball, but nothing else ""girly"" so I went with what seemed statistically most likely - a girl that likes to look nice but isn't froofroo. And you little rocks and feathers everywhere, plus your calendar is a mountain, so I figured live nature.

Please though...
What is that blue B shaped pinata looking thing on top of your bookshelf. Its itching my brain not to know what it is!!

Eta: I went back and looked at the photo on your board. Its grainy so maybe I just had a lucky break and its not a military photo - but it looks like it from what I can tell."

ABraThatFits,fdhv3yt,t1_fdhspgh,1578430685.0,"Yes. In my comment I said ""venting frustration"" but a better and more accurate phrase would have been ""venting frustration as negative self talk,"" which you describe. I'm a 26-D or 28-C. If you're my size and you want to state your overwhelming frustration that even specialty boutiques don't carry a decent selection I'm right there with you! (Edit: although I don't personally think it's necessary to do so to get good fit finding help). Want to state your overwhelming disappointment in your breasts and degrade their worth, and I want to cover mine's metaphorical boobie ears and whisper ""shhh!"" I have gone through a lot of personal work to feel confident and I want to share insights about how to care for my cupcakes without rising regression."
ABraThatFits,fdhrmew,t1_fdhqjdu,1578428823.0,"This is a legitimate struggle and its okay to feel down about it and need to vent. But I think the point op is making isn't that can't vent, but that you shouldn't vent in this particular sub. Venting frustration isn't the same thing as finding a bra that fits and its not necessary to the process, even if the experience is often frustrating. (And oh, is it ever!) When seeking advice on bra size (and this is my opinion) it's of course important to mention the challenges you're facing as that's relevant info. But there's a difference between delving into a spiral of negativity about your size and shape and stating the challenges you're looking mitigate. :/"
