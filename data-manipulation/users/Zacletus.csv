Steam,fel8zwi,t1_fel7tuf,1579216675.0,"GoG Galaxy (their launcher) has been a thing for awhile. They actually have 2.0 in beta and you're supposed to be able to use it to launch (and manage?) steam and windows store games. I haven't used that feature much because it's easy enough to launch steam anyway.

As for why I prefer GoG, I like knowing I have DRM Free copies and supporting a storefront that supports DRM Free."

todayilearned,fdejplv,t1_fdehk8q,1578340475.0,"Currently you can get 3 months for $1, otherwise standard price looks to be $10 a month for just PC, $15 for PC and xBox. No, you don't keep the games unless you buy them. I think some games have discounts if you have game pass, but I'm not completely sure how all that works."
todayilearned,fde1cgp,t1_fde0osn,1578328957.0,"Yep, I am. I keep forgetting about Wilds and didn't read close enough so my brain completed it as Worlds"
todayilearned,fddwx6y,t1_fddv6ds,1578325978.0,"It's on PC Game Pass as well.  Means playing it through windows 10 store, but still an option.

Edit: I read Worlds, not Wilds. Outer Wilds isn't on game pass, but Worlds is."
