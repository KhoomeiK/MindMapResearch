It is, in my opinion, more apt to the situation as Google is drowning themselves along with their clients by signalling that their products have unreliable lifetimes."

todayilearned,fc8n196,t1_fc8iybn,1577538253.0,"It would also be heroic to recognize that you can't always just wait for somebody else to do it. If a house is burning, you don't know how much time the people inside might have. It's better for somebody to make an attempt to rescue people immediately with a 50% chance of success than professionals to come later and do it with a 10% chance of success. But at the same time it's difficult to judge if the professionals would have had a 90% chance of success if the window was left intact for instance. It's one of the problems with helping people, you can't know if your help will be effective or even have a net negative effect. He might have also gained very valuable data while roaming around in the house, such as seeing that there isn't anybody inside, which would help when other rescue workers arrive, so they wouldn't need to risk themselves. I think both approaches are necessary, having people give first aid and others that seek help, and neglecting either is probably bad. The man was a former firefighter, so it seems he may have been a professional already and was probably somewhat adept at judging the risk. On the other hand maybe his risk-taking is what caused him to become a _former_ firefighter. We just can't know that."

todayilearned,fc87ybf,t1_fc7pwid,1577528900.0,"They saved a cat so arguably it was the right choice. Especially if instead of a cat, it would have been a person. The kids can be taught that they can sit idly by and let other people burn to death later (/s) but in the moment, I would argue it was the right choice. Breaking the window does make the fire burn quicker, but it may have been necessary to be able to breathe or something we don't know about. Anyways it's their choice to go there or not, and I would prefer that somebody take a risk to save my loved ones rather than wait for the firetrucks. Man can wait but fire cannot."
