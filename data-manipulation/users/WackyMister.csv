dubai,fgopsj0,t3_ezpl1k,1580980580.0,"Don’t go for the thickest thing you can see, ensure you layer up with lighter / thinner stuff.

Give importance to the actual material of the clothes (e.g wool, down feather) as they are very effective.

If you aren’t sure at all, then wearing a thermal inner-wear will help.

You budget is more than adequate.

For example, you can wear a normal shirt, a wool sweater on it, and then a decent jacket on top. If the jacket it too light, wear a fleece jacket underneath it. Even I’m not used to the cold at all but this worked for me during my trip to the UK in winter."

The simple reality is that the mess Pakistan is in will really take time to fix. No matter who is in charge. You cannot just reverse the damage done over the past few decades - that’s how long we’ve been going down, yet people are expecting things to be fixed within 2 years."
