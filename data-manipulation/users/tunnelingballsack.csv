You've never posted anything bad about this guy before and now suddenly he's the worst because he wouldn't go get you an incredibly powerful pain killer. That's not exactly a normal reaction.  


Also I'm curious how someone infertile can be an egg donor? God, to a gay couple even. Congrats on fucking that kid up before it was even born.  

Go take a Motrin."

But do you have some kind of pill problem? Most people don't avoid picking up meds like that unless they're worried about getting addicted. And morphine is high potential for abuse.   


Just the way this was written makes me think it's fake. If you can type all this out with a broken wrist and finger you're fine. Take a Motrin. 


Your cat likely wasn't starving, just begging. All of this is just ridiculous."

In the time it took me to wash the dishes my toddler had climbed up the changing table and dumped all the baby wipes into the garbage one at a time. Then climbed down the changing table and drew me a lovely picture in black crayon on the wall. Thank god for magic erasers."
