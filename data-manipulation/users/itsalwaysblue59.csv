If that judges son got caught smoking I guarenfuckintee he would get a slap on the wrist. Most politicians and judges have at least done that form of corruption if not more
TheOutsider,ffzzao0,t3_ew2eah,1580396657.0,I mean......you despised a character that was meant to be despised. Doesn’t that already make him a great actor? He accomplished exactly what his character was supposed to accomplish and went above and beyond.
titanfolk,ffzqf5x,t1_ffzotsp,1580389844.0,No
titanfolk,ffygdvm,t3_evmj1s,1580345785.0,It has been finished even later than this. They announced it today so really it was right on time.
aww,ffyap6z,t3_evo4tg,1580341948.0,My roommate had a flying squirrel as a pet for some reason and I had a cat. Lemme tell your it was a huge fuckin hassle trying to make sure my cat didn’t eat it. So many times I looked over and saw my cat had it in his mouth. It was wild.

SandLand,ffy4lav,t3_evr3hw,1580338437.0,School has been kicking my ass so I haven’t even thought about leaks until now. Guess my watch has begun.
movies,ffy1ase,t3_evpljr,1580336585.0,Portia what you doing girl? She is an amazing actress need to continue being in amazing stuff.
television,ffy0211,t1_ffvrpv7,1580335841.0,Interesting I quit watching when the brody(?) storyline was over. I may look into it
television,ffxzyl7,t3_ev8bbx,1580335784.0,I’m in
television,ffxzc6g,t1_ffxapdf,1580335411.0,Like others are saying I believe it is because it is slower than breaking bad. BB could be slow for sure but there seemed to always be a big wow moment of violence every few episodes. I fuckin love better call Saul but I get why others were turned off.
worldpolitics,ffxmczp,t1_ffxm399,1580328057.0,It’s always the people trying to tell everyone how upset everyone else is that gets the most upset. It gets pretty sad.
worldpolitics,ffxc8h1,t1_ffx8e8r,1580322177.0,Awww look at this lil snowflake crying about liberals. It’ll be alright lil buddy.
servant,ffv4x9v,t3_evcnta,1580255763.0,Just people not used to mystery box shows. They want their answers now! Even though this is a multi season show. I think it would suck way more if the first season gave away all the answers and they had to come up with new mysteries every season. That would be lost syndrome....not what this is.
gaming,ffupcnd,t1_ffunnbj,1580246735.0,Imagine reading this post and then writing this completely seriously haha
television,ffuaenw,t3_ev6ndp,1580237836.0,If glazer is involved im in 1000% percent. If not hopefully they get someone really good to be the show runner bc I loved that movie.
PublicFreakout,ffua1hz,t1_ffu9hef,1580237621.0,"I’m just saying that everyone here acting like it’s no big deal to keep hitting a knocked out person need to realize that’s not always the case. I know dissenting opinions on this are getting heavily downvoted but like the OP said the guy lost a tooth and stuff but there can also be a lot more damage when stuff like this happens. The bigger guy was in the right in this situation and I’m not even saying that I don’t understand why he kept hitting him, because I do. But I’ve seen first hand what can happen when the knocked out guy is a lot more hurt than you’d think he would be. It sucks to see the person who was defending themselves get in a lot of trouble because his hits caused a lot more damage than they would in other situations. But hey maybe I’m wrong and that was just a bad situation idk."
DarK,ffu94g3,t1_ffu8vcd,1580237082.0,Yea same they have done some amazing work with this show. A show with twists and turns like this could get easily convoluted and I was worried about that before season 2 was released. But man I have full faith in those guys now. I can’t wait for the final season to see how everything connects and wraps up.
PublicFreakout,ffu8hue,t1_ffu87il,1580236710.0,"Yes I do know what adrenaline does in the moment. I get why he did it I’m not saying that, I was just agreeing with the other guy when saying he needs to learn to control himself in situations like that. I know it is harder to do than I’m saying. Things can get a lot uglier very fast when those who get in fights with smaller people can’t control their adrenaline. I’ve seen some really really fucked up situations when someone lets their emotions get the better of them. That’s all, so I’m not really even disagreeing with you that much.

Edit: also I’m not the original guy you replied to."
witcher,ffu7zo3,t3_ev77wr,1580236408.0,Bro he got some sick skills
PublicFreakout,ffu7pss,t1_ffu6r02,1580236245.0,Yes I agree with what you are saying but also he kept hitting the guy on the ground well after he was knocked out and done. That’s the difference here.
witcher,ffu7ax4,t3_ev7yzs,1580236000.0,I could watch a million of these
DarK,ffu4bxi,t1_ffu49le,1580234210.0,Yea I liked what you wrote for sure really cool analysis
DarK,ffu3q0s,t1_fftmbgr,1580233830.0,I really hope Adam is Jonas. I really like the idea that the main characters antagonist is an older version of himself. Yet I’m not entirely convinced that what Adam is doing is bad. I think it’s gonna be way more complicated than that.

television,fftl3zt,t3_ev5lxe,1580223341.0,Why can’t they get shit like this right? Just do the game stories not original stories. They can even deviate a bit to make it a little original if they want but god damn come on.
movies,fftdk9s,t1_ffr501i,1580217378.0,I was about to say this as well
titanfolk,fftah2r,t1_fft4xxv,1580214410.0,"Yea going this far would be the issue in my head, I have no problem thinking younger eren would understand the reasonings. It’s just back then he saw what Reiner and co did as the worst and most despicable thing you could do. And he loved his dad and etc etc etc. not saying he doesn’t still love his dad or think what he is doing is despicable but I def think the convo between young and old eren would be an interesting one haha"
titanfolk,ffsf17l,t1_ffsevlf,1580180119.0,Oh yea I agree with all that I just was saying they are two separate groups but very closely entwined together. I also could be wrong but yea I agree with the yelena stuff for sure. Either way though yelena is def the floch to zeke’s volunteers.

television,ffsdbkd,t3_eurvk7,1580178971.0,I’ve been meaning to watch this show. I heard so little about it but what I have heard has been good.
television,ffsd95n,t1_ffs9zrt,1580178927.0,I may be off base here but I believe BBC made a series this year and epix made a separate series as well.
television,ffsd541,t3_eurqu4,1580178855.0,My god this just got me so hyped
titanfolk,ffscoze,t1_ffs7avz,1580178561.0,In a way even though that was a joke they are right.  Floch is the leader who got his orders from eren himself. Everyone else is just listening to flochs orders.
titanfolk,ffscgqt,t3_eusedv,1580178410.0,Not being mean here but sounds like you speed read the manga if you got that event and the shiganshina event mixed up. It is easy to do when reading the manga for the first time.
titanfolk,ffscaxl,t3_eushav,1580178302.0,Duh why do you think eren has been practicing hardening all this time?
titanfolk,ffsc5zk,t3_eupdua,1580178211.0,I want to know what younger eren would think of who he has become. Would he agree? Like what would younger eren think of the fact that he manipulated his dad into killing the reiss fam? And that he has all but disowned mikasa and armin and co? I guess it would matter what time period eren saw the future. Man it is all just so interesting.
horror,ffsafmc,t1_ffs4m1n,1580177052.0,Uhhhh what? You are so far off I can’t tell if you are serious.

movies,ffs3ve6,t1_ffrtbjr,1580172480.0,Not even being mean here but you totally forget you are even reading subs after a few mins. Everyone goes through the hurdle of thinking subs are shitty but once you get over it you have so many amazing movies open to you. Trust me it’ll be worth it.
television,ffrohb0,t1_ffrmtnl,1580162309.0,Na I know. And I def don’t agree with the dude. I guess it just reminds me of the whole Scorsese marvel stupid debate you know?

television,ffrm522,t1_ffrm0qf,1580160889.0,You aren’t as intense with your hate as other fans I’ve seen. I guess the level of hatred just because he said a few negative things is baffling to me is all.
television,ffrj63c,t3_euglhb,1580159084.0,I’ve never been a big fan of these guys. Don’t know why you’d want to watch a video of guys critiquing stuff. I’m sure they enjoy things as well but yea not my thing.
television,ffriyor,t1_ffr7gna,1580158958.0,I honestly don’t see why this would make people hate the dude. Truthfully who cares what he said? The games are great....as are the books and so is the show. just enjoy them?

woahdude,ffr1ql9,t1_ffqhu07,1580148549.0,Exactly what I was thinking of the whole time

saltierthancrait,ffqp42m,t1_ffqp1zf,1580140343.0,Yea not arguing that. Insane people can be women too and are in fact humans

saltierthancrait,ffqmrwx,t1_ffqkzfq,1580138727.0,A lot of them are women sorry
television,ffp9j5o,t1_ffp98xd,1580089541.0,Agreed on all points. I also saw a lot of people in the servant sub pissed everything wasn’t explained in the season finale when it’s been known that this is a multiple season story. I think a lot of viewers jumped into the show without knowing what a mystery box type show is or maybe they didn’t have a lot of experience with the shyamalan.
gaming,ffp8lgb,t3_euczrh,1580088920.0,"I thought ocarina of time was the pinnacle of graphics and gaming in general. My god do I need to play that game again, I played that the longest of any game maybe minus super Mario world."
DarK,ffp70jg,t3_euapco,1580087826.0,Im over expecting endings that “no one would ever expect!!!” I’m happy with just a simple good ending at this point for my shows. Wild surprise endings work a lot of the time but sometimes they fuck up the show.
MindHunter,ffp2zla,t3_eu3few,1580085205.0,I could see this being the kinda show that comes back in a year or two or even longer. Just random seasons with long breaks when fincher is available.
television,ffn8h7f,t1_ffn7vj1,1580063043.0,Exactly haha so many shows have a mediocre pilot. I at least give two or three a chance for it to find it’s stride before completely writing off a show. Sometimes I’m very happy I gave it a chance and other times not so much.
television,ffn5be8,t1_ffn4qd6,1580062166.0,Oh me too trash TV is always fun. My bad I took your comment as hating but I see I was wrong! Yea I just see so many people who think if they don’t like something then no one should and all that fun stuff and I always get confused by that.
television,ffn48uo,t1_ffmfa66,1580061908.0,Bc everyone has different tastes. If the stuff you thought was really good was the only stuff being praised someone would come on here and say the same exact thing you just said haha.
television,ffn2yh3,t3_eu5nhg,1580061462.0,Personally I loved it but I do understand why someone wouldn’t
television,ffmxfxq,t3_eu6abl,1580059891.0,Oh no.....
ChoosingBeggars,ffjv0fz,t1_ffjuydr,1580007708.0,God exactly or picking up other people or who knows what. Like imagine if he totaled it or scratched it or anything. That dude wouldn’t be nice about it.
ChoosingBeggars,ffjuqtl,t1_ffjumdi,1580007496.0,I guess? maybe I’m just not very trustful but so much could go wrong letting your friend just drive your new car around all night. But yea especially if they are dicks but man idk if I’d just let my friend take my car out till 10 pm if they had their own car. I’d let them like to run an errand they really needed to do but just use it all day/night? I personally wouldn’t.

cyberpunkgame,ffj82hq,t1_ffj7zf4,1579992704.0,Uhhhh okay man haha. My bad didn’t think you’d take all this so seriously. But for real I am pretty positive you could just change some settings on whatever you are playing on. No need to be so snippy haha.
movies,ffj7sc4,t1_ffj7ddr,1579992519.0,Truthfully I thought it was a mix of the two. But even becoming enlightened my opinion hasn’t changed. But alright cool glad no offense was taken.
cyberpunkgame,ffj76rs,t1_ffj72jn,1579992104.0,Sorry that flew over my head. It would be simpler to say yea I tried to change it but it wouldn’t or something like that. But looking at other replies to you it looks like a lot of people didn’t run into the issue you are having. Therefore there’s prob something you can do on your end. But if not then that’s okay with me.
movies,ffj3fkk,t1_ffj39em,1579989404.0,"Okay I don’t really see why what I said needed this big response haha. It’s a website with scores and I said the website with scores is trash? That’s all. People still look at the site and say oh wow this movie must’ve sucked since it has an F. I get what you are saying but I feel like you just explained something to me for no reason, no offense."

movies,ffiu49q,t3_etn18i,1579982769.0,I get that this movie sucks but I think CinemaScore is trash. To give bug and mother! an F and hereditary a what D or something? Makes no sense.
movies,ffitza2,t1_ffiicgb,1579982672.0,Yea you are right. Chernobyl never happened.....it was all fake news! Thank you my Russian overlords for making me see the light!!!

TheOutsider,fffgmnq,t1_fffgj8q,1579883531.0,No if anything my comments afterwards point towards every sub/forum having this issue. So if anything we are arguing a lot of the same points.
TheOutsider,fffg9uo,t1_fffg5qg,1579883311.0,"Wait I wasn’t the original person who made this post? I just made a comment. I wasn’t even really saying anything about the post I was just making the point that there are people doing that, didn’t really say the sub wouldn’t work?"
TheOutsider,ffffpwg,t1_fffdzmn,1579882968.0,"Yes I know that. But any show or movie where there is a book there are people who have read it who act like they haven’t. I’m not sure why that’s so hard to understand truthfully haha. Yes of course someone could guess what happens I’m not saying that’s not possible. I’m simply saying there is for sure people who have read the book covertly spoiling people, not saying everyone who guesses right is spoiling people."

Cringetopia,ffe87bl,t3_et142v,1579839350.0,Her replies to people on that comment chain are just as bad.
TheOutsider,ffe72oc,t1_ffe6x52,1579838441.0,I mean it isn’t anything negative about the mods or this sub in general. No matter the show or movie people will act like they didn’t read the book and post their “theories”. It is impossible to tell because not everyone discusses every book they’ve read. It isn’t just here it’s everywhere on show subreddits. Shitty people are everywhere haha.
television,ffe4739,t1_ffe45iv,1579836251.0,Yep that’s why said that haha
TheOutsider,ffdzp7s,t1_ffcwjcx,1579832958.0,There are 1000% multiple people on here who claim to have not read the book just spoiling people. “Here is my totally random theory guys” then just proceed to spoil the whole book/show. Annoying people who want to sound smart.

news,ff9dcbr,t1_ff8zeeq,1579710515.0,Yea but you can’t tell who the good ones are just by looking at them so it is easier to just think they all are bad. Especially when interacting with one.
