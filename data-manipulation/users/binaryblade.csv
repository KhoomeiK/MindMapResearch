learnmath,ff3tl3p,t3_eraw94,1579548563.0,"For video games its sufficient to have something appear random (without actually being random. To do this they use functions which have a highly unpredictable behaviour, the details of which are pretty heavy in the math  and there is some heuristics to them as well to validate performance. Many are variants of linear feedback shift registers but they get more complicated. 

The idea being that you seed this function once with a known value and then repeatedly evaluate it using the previous state as the new seed. Because it's very difficult to predict the next state from just the outputs, it gives the appearance of randomness. Eventually, it will start repeating but usually not for the age of the universe or so. Likewise, I said it's difficult (but not impossible) to determine the state of the generator from it's outputs. 

So all this is fine for stuff that just needs to appear random, but what about things that really do need to be not predictable like cryptographic keys. Well, These systems tend to be pretty good at that too, but modern computers have another trick up their sleeve. They have true randomness generation. Some have dedicated hardware, while some do it by looking at all the Inputs and outputs on the system. If you ever do a certificate generation on a computer and it asks you to move the mouse around and kit the keyboard, that's what it's doing. Taking randomness from the outside world, namely you. 

So if computers can generate truely random numbers, why not do that all the time. Well, When you're moving the mouse around or the little tempurature monitors are flickering about, that stuff isn't completely random. If you move your mouse in one direction, there is a good bet that in the next instance it will be moving in the same direction. So, the randomness (entropy) that the system collects is fairly low grade and takes a long time to accumulate.

So given these two methods, we have more tools in our tool box for different applications. For games that only need to appear random and performance is more important so we approximate. For security, where we only need the randomness from time to time, it's more important that it be good randomness and so we use entropy generators."

That they form a basis for a space and that basis is (like the cartesian basis) strictly orthognonal with respect to the inner product. 
The inner product for this space <f,g> is integral(f(x)*g(x),x,-inf,inf) which satisfies all the properties an inner product needs. Thus, when you consider sin and cos:

integral(cos(at)*cos(bt),t,-inf,inf) = dirac(a-b)

integral(sin(at)*sin(bt),t,-inf,inf) = dirac(a-b)

integral(sin(at)*cos(bt),t,-inf,inf) = 0 

This whole linear transform theory is based on specifying an inner product such that functions are vectors.

> Also, I was wondering about this, but what do you think was Fourier's intuition about decomposing signals into specifically sin and cos waves of varying frequencies?

I suspect he was trying to solve the heat equation and found that sin/cos would solve it, but he needed a way to build up arbitrarily complex solutions. He knew it was linear so that sums could work, but he had to prove that using only sin/cos alone was sufficient and that was the big insight. 

>  I wonder if you could possibly decompose any complex function via appropriate (ie abstract space dependent) basis functions?

Well there are often convergence criterion that depend on the basis and the inner product and I suspect that you could find some functions so pathelogical that finding an inner product and complete basis for it would be neigh impossible. However, nearly all the ""nice"" functions we work with for physical things can be decomposed. In fact, that kind of decomposition is essential for working with them on computers and cuts to the heart of numeric simulation.

They are useful to physics because they are solutions to f''(x) + f(x) = 0 thus giving rise to wavelike phenomenon. Exponentials statisfy this if you admit complex numbers and also work for f'(x)+f(x)=0 for real numbers so there are slightly more general. More specifically d exp(x) /dx = exp(x) which means they are somewhat invariant to any order of derivative. 

The property of sinusoids that we are interested in here is the fact that they are orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product and complete with respect to the hilbert space. This is useful because it results in unitary transforms (no stretching or squeezing) and thus efficient decomposition and that we can represent any function in the hilbert space within the transformed coordinates.

sin(a)*sin(b) = ?

something involving a trig identities, i'd have to look it up. 

exp(a)*exp(b) = exp(a+b) simple exponential properties 

You will get similar results for the products sin and cos, but whether the result is a sin/cos or whether it's positive or negative all vary. Turns out all those are special cases of the exponential product when you take into account Euler's theorem. 

You need to understand that exp(ix) = cos(x) + isin(x) is and equivalence relation, one can be substituted for the other. 

cos(x) = Re{exp(ix)}

sin(x) = Im{exp(ix)}

you can always chose one representation or the other, it just might be simpler or more convenient in some cases. I find the complex representations to be more convenient because it eliminates most of the special cases and having to keep track of two distinct quantities at the cost of having to use complex numbers. I think that's a pretty fair trade.

I've heard that modern physics consider Hilbert space all the way until the quantum level, so I'd assume that any waves in reality can be transformed with Fourier transforms.

Hilbert spaces are the spaces of finite square integration (there is an extension to finite power if your signal is periodic), so nearly all physical phenomenon are in this space because (usually) the energy in the signal is the square integration and things are finite energy/finite power. This isn't necessarily true for some arbitrary approximation or model you are using. If your signal is blowing up or if it converges too slowly, then your transform might not converge."
learnmath,feknuti,t3_epijbv,1579203940.0,"> Also, do you know what's the intuition behind using phase? Why opt for finding phase and magnitude of a Fourier transform instead of the real and imaginary parts?

Those are literally Identical statements. If you know the phase and amplitude, you know the components. The only reason to use complex numbers is because the notation is compact and convenient. An exponential is far easier to work with then sin, cos and products thereof. 


The result of performing the Fourier transform on a function in time is a function of angular frequency. The Fourier transform itself is a transform, that is, it takes a function and converts to another function. 

Colloquially we might refer to that result as the Fourier transform of the original signal, but it might be a bit more accurate to say that is the ""fourier transformed function"" or it's ""representation in the Fourier space""

The reason for this language is because the Fourier transform is a rotation of sorts, a change in coordinates. The underlying object (a function) is the same, but you are viewing it from two different angles which gives you a different perspective and perhaps more insight. Any function which meets the criterion to be transformed (either it's in the hilbert space or one of a select few others) then we can use the Fourier transform to express the function in angular frequency. In a similar manner that we can express an object in either Cartesian or polar coordinates.

The choice of the structure of D, the actual structure of A and the overall optimization formulation, all of these matter. If you look at the singular value spectrum of A that will tell you which range of your d will be relavant. That said this inverse is not unique. I could have just as easily be formulated as :

J = x^t D x + l (Ax-b)

which is minimize x^t D x subject to Ax = b  

and have something which can be legitimately called a pseudo inverse
It results in D^-1 A^t (A D^-1 A^t )^-1 

or I can define the inverse in other fashions such as:
invert via the largest eigenvectors of A such that the condition number of the resulting matrix is less than Y

The approach depends on the formulation of your minimization, which depends on the quantity you are seeking to resolve. There isn't one way to perform a pseudo inverse, because performing a pseudo inverse necessarily requires filling in missing data and what you fill in depends on your problem."

Also look at the construction of the minimization. As D becomes larger, then larger vectors are penalized (not preferred) and thus shorter results are weighted. Likewise, as D becomes smaller, it is more important that the residual is smaller and better fits are preferred.  

You are also neglecting the A^t bit at the beginning where you get the initial projection of b into your space.  The idea is when D is zero you can do that initial A^t projection and then you can backout all the cross coupling of the terms with (A^t A)^-1 . Likewise, as you increase D you say, ignore the cross coupling and just use the regular projection because the system is ill-conditioned anyway (but also shrink it towards zero). It's along the same vein of weiner deconvolution, where you have this constant noise floor that starts setting things to zero as your SNR gets smaller (if you know filter stuff). 

Most of the usefulness of these techniques comes from understanding the underlying minimization and the preferences that go into it's formulation. In fact, most analyses requires the formulation of the preferred or unique minimization inorder to codify in what way things are optimal. The actual structure of the inverse that falls out is just mechanics. This stuff is all completely useless if you are trying to just grab a formula and come to a conclusion."

The choice of a scaled identity is to specifically avoid weighting your results when conditioning.

In fact it's your A that will play favourites and D will allow you to weight towards either the preferred directions in A and the more regularized uniform space described by D."

If it's full speed USB then it might be hit and miss as that signals closer to 12 Mhz, you could just have a short cable. If you tried to put Hi-Speed or Super speed it will choke. Thing is, even if it ""works"". the USB spec provides required return loss and impedance mismatch so it will be difficult to meet the actual spec and as such will likely work or not work depending on which machine or port you plug it into.

Isomorphism implies bijection such that you are making the statement that all finite dimensional vectors are rank 1 tensors. This statement is not true. 

In order for something to be a tensor it must transform like a tensor (a change in coordinates alters the components by a jacobian multiplication). This is the defining and interesting characteristic of a tensor, not the fact that it can be written as a grid, list or N-dimensional array of numbers, nor the fact that the multiplication is performed like in a dimensional collapsing product and sum fashion. An arbitrary vector (such as a position vector) does not transform like a tensor and is thus not one. 

There is some annoyance here because the machine learning and GPGPU folks will refer to any N-dimensional grid of numbers as a tensor but this is not strictly true."
