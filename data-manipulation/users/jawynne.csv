AskReddit,ff78hy6,t3_es1kg2,1579643206.0,"I support the right to bear arms. But I also recognize that when the 2nd amendment was ratified people were using muskets. Guns have come a long, LONG way since then. Sensible gun control is something we should all get behind. There are those who will resist ANY of this talk as an assault on their rights. But we don't let citizens have grenades do we? Or C4? What if I told you that I feel like I should have the right to own C4? I can responsibly use C4! But the government won't let me. UNFAIR! How do we not extend that logic (to ban citizens from owning C4) to something like an assault rifle? At what point do we say ""...you know what, a citizen doesn't need to own that. That kind of weapon should only be owned by law enforcement or the military."""

AskReddit,ff6pqbo,t3_ery9ig,1579632306.0,"Most of her appeal (for now) has to do with the talent to age ratio. She was 14 when she recorded ""Ocean Eyes."" I was a fucking idiot at 14. And then her most recent record ""When We All Fall Asleep...."" was really, really good. And she was 17 when it came out I think? I'm not super familiar with her work but I get the impression that it is pretty singular music. I get the feeling that she is doing her own thing. She's not a clone of anything else if that makes sense. And people gravitate toward singular music. It seems like her music might represent her generation. Or at least people might look back and think of it that way. I know I'm rambling. I do worry about her future. Fiona Apple had a moment of clarity at age 18 when Criminal was all over MTV. She's still putting out good music but it took years of soul-searching to really find her way. Billie Eilish will need to surround herself with good people who care about her and not just the money."
AskReddit,ff6lrnl,t3_eryepi,1579629911.0,I've done both. It really just depends on how much real estate I have to work with. We have a walk-in shower right now. So I dry off in the shower. But when I had a smaller tub shower I would partially dry off inside and finish outside. In general I don't want a shitload of water on my floor. And even if you use a mat it just gets disgusting quick with repeated exposure to water day after day.
