LateStageCapitalism,fffuuop,t1_fffth0c,1579892292.0,"there are degrees and degrees.  as i wrote elsewhere in this thread, i agree capitalism makes bastards of us all.  however, advertising is the propaganda arm of the capitalists and property owning classes.  if you believe we are only mostly, as in not completely and entirely, disenfranchised then a person choosing to work in a capacity that attempts to perpetuate capitalism (and nothing more) is working for evil, to put not too fine of a point on it"
LateStageCapitalism,ffftxrz,t1_fffse3z,1579891725.0,"to reiterate, your entire career, your entire industry, is  deliberately propagating the idea that consumerism is normal and healthy, you deliberately obtuse goblin.

you are so fucking bereft of argument that your second paragraph is nothing more than whataboutism, an ad hominem attack.

again, if you want some justification for your career, go find some neoliberals who’ll stroke your ego and tell you that you’re not doing anything evil.  you’re not amongst folks that’ll fall for your “fellow kids” style here"
LateStageCapitalism,fffqf99,t1_fffnwuk,1579889554.0,"so you facilitate consumerism which is effectively the culture of capitalism?  

consumerism attempts to replace a genuine participatory culture with an artificial one that is actually harmful to the physical health and mental wellbeing of nearly everybody who is forced to deal with the gaslighting crap you and your ilk spew out. 

why don’t you fuck off to some neoliberal sub if you want fucking sympathy.  **you are part of the problem.**  you directly feed the beast"
LateStageCapitalism,ffffjv2,t1_fffe6ei,1579882865.0,"you write ad copy means you write a tagline on the propaganda poster.  you are actively participating in a psyop against your fellow man, to make them feel inadequate so continue to consume and perpetuate the system of inequity and misery.  

by being a stock broker, your girlfriend is a rent seeker no matter how you try to dress it up.  a stock market only exists in capitalist system, to wit, the very thing leftist is opposed to.  

the only thing you’re angry about is that you’re not a bigger boot on a bigger neck"
LateStageCapitalism,fffbq64,t1_fffb1ia,1579880449.0,"this fuckstick is a propagandist for capitalism.  

this shitstain’s job entails using psychology to make strangers feel afraid, inadequate and isolated if they don't participate unhealthily in consumerism.  there is being made a bastard by capitalism and then there’s actively perpetuating it for your own gain at other’s increased disenfranchisement and poverty.

it’s galling this human excrement would call itself a leftist as everything they do is anathema to what we believe in.  fucker cuts a less sympathetic figure than petain"

LateStageCapitalism,fffa0wy,t1_fff81qi,1579879359.0,the us’s obesity epidemic and its growth seems to me to coincide not only with the greater prevalence of cable tv in homes over the decades but also with how much more the cable bill is a percentage of the household entertainment budget.  people can’t afford to go out to a sporting event or movie or to go bowling or play other sports or lack a neighbourhood bar or cafe or even anywhere to just walk to
