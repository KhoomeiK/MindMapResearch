Leathercraft,fdl0x4s,t3_elqxvg,1578515109.0,"It's a touchy subject, right? There is a pretty case of this from a couple years ago between a couple makers that seemed to basically boil down to ""we are all taking inspiration or incorporating part of a previous design in our own"". Having a one piece wallet that is wrapped around itself a couple times isn't a novel idea, and there were cases of very similar designs being used well before those two makers had a pissing match.

When I first started, I made a simple card holder that is one piece folded over, and has a trapezoidal opening at the top to grab cards. It just made sense to me. I started looking at makers and saw that a few use the same basic idea in their designs for the slot to grab a card from. I didn't get the idea from them, but my design sure is similar. 

There aren't really THAT many new ways to make a wallet that haven't been done, right? 

I think there's enough space for people to throw their own stank on something to make it their ""own"", whether it's a different line on the pockets or a different radius on the corners, or adding some mark/tooling accent. Hell, even using different colors or textures can go a long way.

I'm not great, definitely not comparable to a lot of the artists on here, but I've been doing it for about a year now. I started off with some templates, because I figured it would help me learn technique, and then I could use the knowledge from learning how to stitch or finish leather when I make my own designs. 

I think an analogy would be how one might go about learning to cook. I wouldn't recommend buying ingredients and throwing them together and hoping for the best. It is nice to be able to have a recipe to work on, and then make changes to later on to make it more in line with my own tastes."

I think it would be worthwhile if posting first week losses was discouraged, because they are far from realistic, and I think it can have a negative effect on people in the long run. There was a guy last week who was discouraged because he was ""only"" losing 1-2lbs a week, when he didn't have a lot to lose in the first place."
