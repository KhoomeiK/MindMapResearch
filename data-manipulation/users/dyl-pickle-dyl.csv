depression,fdhjmy4,t3_el7p7n,1578424051.0,"Not to sound offensive or like a dick, nobody would care, you shouldn’t preach about hating yourself. Learn to love yourself start small build big, if you talk about i hate myself more then you could who would care? Who would actually think wow they are right they are that down on themselves no they wouldn’t we all individually go through our own problems. You should focus on caring for yourself fuck the others stop worrying about other peoples thoughts actions etc. You are better than them, you are amazing beautiful and smart strong etc any word that is good applies to YOU. Just dont beat yourself down when your already down, bring yourself up i promise it takes time but you really can do this."
depression,fdgeptj,t1_fdgcf43,1578393315.0,"You’re lost, I’m lost too, sometimes I sit in my car after work or after just class and just stare at the world outside and ask myself why I even exist. I want to die sometimes I want to feed into the passion of not existing. I have tried medication from my doctor smoking weed drinking etc, nothing helps just numbs down what is inevitable, you will never forget what has made you sad or what has hurt you. You won’t forget how tough this shit is, but having these memories as shit as they are they should NEVER and I fucking mean never no offense to you with my cursing but never ever dictate what you do to yourself harmful wise you are a person who has control of your life and the things you do are yours to make good or bad I just hope you do the right thing for yourself however you see that good morally wise for your wellbeing I just hope you understand that although you feel like a blob and so empty and shitty that this thing can turn around it may take a day, a month, years fuck it might take your whole life and even when you have kids you still might feel like shit but guess what. You’re still pushing on, your proving to yourself that not only are you still here putting up with this bullshit but that you are one bad ass motherfucker and you are a strong minded individual someone who won’t take the easy way out just because you are afraid of life keeping you down. You got this seriously I know this shit seems like its over but its not, no matter what position you are in it is never over until the lights are out, you still have every opportunity to fight for this shit, and I hope to fuck that you do. Please do i hope you have a good morning, day or night <3
Sorry if my comment got a lil wild I just don’t want you or anyone giving up on themselves in this beautiful life we are all given even in its shitty nature."

depression,fdg4z0n,t3_el7we4,1578380217.0,"I know nothing I say will even compare to meaning much or helping. I’m sorry for what has happened but please be strong and show yourself you aren’t worthless I know the motive to show everyone you aren’t shit and you are something better than nothing but you have to prove that to yourself. You can do this you’ve made it to 21 by sheer strength and that’s beautiful please keep going on, please keep your head up and just focus on yourself. You got this I’m sure of it, life isn’t always what we want but we can turn this shit hole around. I’m sorry if my message was shit but I hope you turn this around and make it a beautiful story for yourself you deserve a happy old ending. Stay strong<3"

relationship_advice,fcml93n,t3_ei00n4,1577779979.0,"I’ve been cheated on before, I’ll keep it short and simple. Trust your gut, if you believe she is doing right by you even though she once did wrong then work through it, but if you want to work through it DROP THE CHEAT CARD ENTIRELY never use it in an argument etc it will only make this worse and more tense in arguments and make the relationship more fragile than before. If you had a weird feeling that this might happen again it will hurt 100% but you should probably not try to make things work. This is just my opinion."
depression,fbzlfoi,t1_fbzl9e0,1577250687.0,Honestly a couple years ago I’d be feeling really down but its been an uphill battle. I’m finally feeling better and just want/wanted to post this and to help anyone dealing with emotional or physical problems or battles because ik how hard it can be.
