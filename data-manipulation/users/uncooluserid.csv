I also heal them when they get injured, because I tend to line the walls of the prison with tranquilizer turrets for any attempted prison breaks. You are here to mine that quarry forever, not bleed out inside of it. 

I will occasionally release them, but only when we are either: 
A) at capacity
B) are producing too many resources from the quarry which we don't really need anymore
C) Releasing them will increase relations with their faction. Pirates and commandos never leave unless they are being hauled out post-mortem.

Randy save you if you are from the Orion installation faction. Not only does releasing you serve zero purpose since you can't trade with that faction at all, but any pawns that raid from that faction have orion exoskeletons, which are massively better than any other bionic which replaces the spine. I make an active point of removing them and replacing it with a regular bionic spine and then sending them to the mine.

Sure seems like you are pulling a pot/kettle situation, talking about details from various countries with vastly different forms of societal control and infrastructure. Saying citizens of the US should just toughen up and be like HK or Chile is really easy when:
1. You don't live in any of these areas and don't know the challenges the citizens of these various countries face when trying to enact nation wide major change.
2. Have never been faced with a situation where you feel utterly politically powerless.
3. Have no actual solution to the scenario other than what basically amounts to trying to incite violence and revolution in a country in which a massive nationwide revolution/rebellion would be DEVASTATING not just for the country in question, but for the rest of the world, for multiple reasons.

I've been seeing more and more of your type of computer chair call to arms, where people like you who don't live in the place where they are claiming to understand the problems, and don't have any real solutions or depth of understanding about the situation, decide to voice your frustrations. Maybe you legitimately are making an attempt to rally people to action, but news flash, bullying people never makes them take you or what you are saying seriously. Even if you are telling us the truth in many regards like the fact that our current leader is a giant war crime committing cry baby and likely sociopath. Telling us what a shit job we are doing at removing him and then comparing the scenario to other countries with wildly different political climates and struggles and then failing to provide ANY sort of solution you seem to have so easily internally worked out shows how fucking out of touch you are, and how full of shit you are. Instead of yelling at other people about how they should be more active politically, take that patronizing bullshit energy and use it for something positive like making active change in your own country of origin. Even if your country is in a perfectly stable and healthy state politically, there is always more action that can be taken toward positive change whether it is finding out what you can do toward helping our global climate disaster, helping struggling nations find a stronger measure of stability, or helping to sway people away from nationalistic ideologies which prevent us from seeing how much we are all in this together.

RimWorld,fdb4w03,t1_fdayuao,1578253864.0,"Yeah, his claim is that he has intentionally broken all his mods in an effort to voice his disagreements with and protest of Ludeon studios. He doesn't bother going into any further detail though, like you said, because he thinks airing his concerns won't have any effect other than to cause drama. It's a really asinine approach though, considering that intentionally breaking your mod and not giving any explanation besides ""well fucking ask ludeon, I'm done talking about this"" is a REALLY shitty reason that doesn't give the people it affects any understanding or real reason as to why. 

My guess is that he doesn't agree with the stipulation that modded material is still technically Ludeon IP or something along those lines (I am not a modder and don't know the specific details of this, don't quote me). I remember another modder a while back threw a big ol tantrum and intentionally destroyed all her mods also because she didn't agree with Ludeon's practices. Something about the company being able to absorb and incorporate any mod they like, and not needing to compensate the original mod author.

I understand that it can feel like being taken advantage of for free labor, and don't blame anyone for not wanting to be stepped on. I also don't think the correct answer is to burn the entire work to the ground and hurt a bunch of innocent players in order to stick it to Ludeon.

I have had a gym membership at the same gym for a little over a year, but have not been consistent in going and making use of it. One of my resolutions this year is to go to the gym every day I don't have work (4 days of the week). 

One of the things that demoralized me the most was overhearing two of the trainers, one of which had sold me my membership and put on such a good sales face, openly making fun of and talking trash about the resolutionists to one another. A lot of ""I fucking hate these new years losers"" ""can't wait until we have OUR gym back and these people all fail again"". It was a total punch in the gut. I'm not even in bad shape, i'm 6'0 at 150 lbs, I bought my membership to build muscle mass and get more definition, not in an effort to lose a ton of weight, and even so I felt so upset by what I overheard that now when I go to the gym and see these trainers it kind of makes me sick to my stomach. 

Like, I get it, the gym gets packed and the space and use of machines becomes more limited due to number of people trying to use it. I still think that's a terrible excuse to treat others as less than human, just because they haven't achieved their goal to the same degree as someone else and haven't found what makes exercise really click for them into a routine."

My roommate had a similar experience to your ex and her roommate. We had a open room we were looking to fill at my home, and my roommate suggested and organized for her best friend to be the one to take the room. Everything seemed to line up, friend was stable and had a good job, was friendly and clean/well put together, and a seemed like a genuinely nice person. About a week or two after her friend finalized moving in and paid 1st month and deposit, my roommate suddenly becomes extremely sullen, depressed, and very avoidant of any attempt to talk about what was bothering her. When we finally did get her to open up she revealed to myself and our other roommate that her friend's partner, who was also a close friend, had been over recently and just hanging out when he forced himself upon her and raped her. They had both been drinking, which was his later excuse as to why it wasn't rape, despite her saying no multiple times and asking him to leave the moment it was over. She felt unsafe, violated, and broken. To top it all off, when my roommate came to her best friend to tell her that her partner had raped her, her best friend wrote her off and decided to just completely pull out of moving out of our home because she was going to side with her partner and just wouldn't believe that he had done what my roommate claimed. My roommate was devestated and it ruined their friendship on the spot. While I recognize that we all dodged a bullet not having this person move in, I also felt tremendously for my roommate who not only went through an extremely traumatic experience but then also lost 2 friends in the process of being honest about what had happened to her.

AskReddit,fciyxse,t1_fcgq1as,1577673176.0,"Yes! Anandamide is a endogenous antagonist for the cannabinoid CB1 and 2 receptors. So when you intake a habitual dose of marijuana which contains exogenous cannabinoids, you create a dependency effect wherein the brain stops producing anandamide, because it's getting all the cannabinoids it needs already (why bother?). Anandamide is thought to be linked to memory retention, especially during REM sleep. This is much like when a Herion addict detoxes and feels extreme pain and sickness, because their body isn't producing endorphins and isn't getting what it has become used to in opioids. When you detox from being a habitual, heavy stoner your brain/body are not producing any anandamide, and are no longer receiving the external dose of cannabinoids from weed.
