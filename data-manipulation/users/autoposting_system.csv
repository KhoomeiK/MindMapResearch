This is what our society chooses to spend its resources on. I find it weird that when you're talking to somebody about NASA and space exploration you hear this idea that we should fix things like world hunger or poverty before we start exploring space or doing research of this kind. It's weird, because this seems like almost the only situation where this comes up. 

They built a new stadium here in Atlanta a couple of years ago, Mercedes-Benz stadium, partially funded by taxes (they used hotel taxes, which otherwise would have gone into the city coffers and reduced property taxes), and nobody was like ""you know, with this kind of money we could house all the homeless in the city,"" or ""think of all the scholarships that would buy."" To me this indicates a bias: people just like sports more than they like NASA."

I'll tell you this though: I used to be a commercial fisherman, and fish have many names. They usually have a scientific Latin name, and then they have like an official name that the fishery is known under, and then there's a name that the fishermen call them, and then there might be several different names under which they're sold in restaurants and grocery stores.

So it could be really complicated. Maybe the Fuji apples that I've had aren't the Fuji apples they're talking about in this diagram. Maybe the Fuji apples that you've had are different too.

The net flow is a trickle downstream, but at any given moment other than slack tide the water flow is much higher. It's kind of strange to be able to ride a river upwards toward its source and then back down toward the mouth and you're going with the current both ways.

I used to know a guy with a hunting cabin beside one of these sloughs, and he would ride a boat upriver to the cabin and then keep the boat in the water at anchor. He got power for his little cabin using something kind of like a little wind generator or windmill, but he just hung it off the stern of the boat and it turned an electric generator using the power of the current. He only had power about 75% of the time, but he said it worked a lot better than solar and it was much more reliable."

How is your cedar holding up? Here in Georgia I used some pine 2x12s to build raised beds and they rotted within 3 years. I'm really interested in building some exterior structures that I want to leave as natural wood and I can't figure out how to do it without rot, except cedar may be the answer.

Information is just too freely available as it is for this not to be the case. Besides, they don't believe in that stuff because of Alex Jones. It's a reflection of themselves and the way that they think of the world. Alex Jones is just saying things that resonate with them. We should know what they are, and we should know that they are resonating with people, because that way we know there's a problem, and the problems that we need to address are the problems that cause these people to start paying attention to Alex Jones.

Believe me, it's better to be exposed to this kind of thing and to know what it is. I wouldn't even know who Alex Jones was if I hadn't heard about him through Joe Rogan.

OutOfTheLoop,ffgcoqn,t1_ffga9f1,1579903310.0,"This is exactly what I'm talking about.

You're not going to not give them a platform. In an environment where even  an ordinary person can make a tweet and it can be heard all over the world, we need some kind of system where we can get real depth on people's attitudes so that we don't misread them and they aren't misrepresented. That goes for whichever side of the fake stupid one-dimensional political spectrum you think you're on. Talking things out and letting the best ideas float to the top, which you're deriding here, is actually the only mechanism we really have for this to happen. You seem to think that that's not going to work, but there's no other way to do it. 

What do you think we should do? sequester ourselves into little camps on either side and just yell at each other about how the other side is terrible and never talk to them again? Nobody listens to the other side anymore. This actually used to be a big insult: when somebody said ""I'm sorry, but you seem to be the kind of person who hasn't actually read anything against their opinion,"" this was a really cutting line. As soon as you decide to never communicate with someone ever again because they have one opinion that's different from yours, not only have you ruined any chance that you have to change their mind, but you've abdicated any ability to discover that you're wrong, which is the only way that we can learn stuff.

You derisively claim that the alt right people aren't interested in a debate. Then you come out and say that you're not interested in a debate either. The mechanism that you're proposing would cut off this avenue of communication. If people thought that they were going to go on Joe Rogan's show and he was going to call them racist, they just wouldn't go on his show. Besides, maybe there are things that we think are racist and aren't. Maybe there are things that we don't think of as racist and they actually are. How will we find out if we don't listen to a mixture of positions?

You sound like you're in favor of destroying any communication that we have in this country other than with people who think exactly like us."
OutOfTheLoop,ffg4gkc,t1_ffg3wge,1579898255.0,"Yeah but if all you ever hear is people yelling about how horrible they are then you won't ever figure out what they actually believe. In contrast to pretty much every single other media outlet, Joe Rogan's podcast presents people as they actually are. If he shouted down everybody he disagreed with, not only would you not hear what they had to say and therefore be unable to have real informed opinions about them, but a lot of them wouldn't appear on his show at all and the opportunity would be completely missed.

Have you ever shot one? It's a pretty terrible experience. Yes, the weight mitigates recoil, the heavy slide mitigates recoil, but somehow it still sucks. I just can't recommend those machines for anybody serious. I mean they cost $150 or something, but just the extra 50 bucks is so much better. Hell, a Sarsilmaz B6P is only $250 at King's right now. You can often find sccy pistols for $200 or $250 on Armslist, and Tauruses are around that amount too, or even less. Hell, there's a place in Atlanta right now selling the Ruger LCP 380 for $215. Whatever the Hi Point 380 weighs, I guarantee that despite the extra weight it's easier to shoot that flyweight Ruger. If you buy a gun and never shoot it because it sucks to shoot, I just don't think it's worth it.

In fact for somebody who's not into the hobby but needs a gun for their house and will practice with it faithfully, I would tell them to buy one of these old Smith revolvers in 38 Special that can be had for $250 all over the place right now. They are much more fun to shoot than a Hi Point, they're probably more reliable, and since they're revolvers they're less prone to operator error, which is a huge deal for a noob. Plus they're Smiths, so they'll have value in thirty years, even Model 10s, which they made six million of.

I know where you're going. I mean I just pointed out that some people don't have a grand to spend on a weapon and training, and those people need lower-priced options. All I'm saying is if all you can afford is a Hi Point, maybe buy an aluminum baseball bat at a thrift store and sell plasma for a couple of months until you can afford something better."
