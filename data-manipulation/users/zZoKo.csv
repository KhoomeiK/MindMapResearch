when you eat above maintainance you promote muscle growth every single day (from previous workout)

if you eat at maintaninance for 6 days of the week you promote very little growth during the 6 days, and since you eat above maintanainance your 7th day you would promote more growth then but its only 1 day of the week and you wont suddenly grow in one day enough to make up for the whole week

so its better to distribuite your calories so you eat slightly above tdee everyday because you have the opportunity to grow every day then and not too many calories extra left to store as fat

in comparasion to only one day of the week, you will only use a small part of the calories towards muscle growth anyway so eating something like 3500 calories once a week will just store all the remaining calories as fat instead of being used for growth everyday if you were to eat it over the course of a whole week"
