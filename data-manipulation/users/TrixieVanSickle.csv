startrek,ffg4o6v,t1_fffxngo,1579898383.0,"I was never a huge fan of the Section 31 concept, but it's canon, it exists and something like this would be an opportunity for them to get involved."

nyc,fff72tc,t3_et1k0d,1579877368.0,I'm old enough to remember when you had a choice of paper or plastic at the grocery store and people always chose plastic or paper in plastic because paper always broke. So I bought a few personalized photo reusable bags that were on sale a few months ago ($4 each) and I now have strong reusable bags that have cool Game of Thrones and Marvel images on them.

startrek,ffc76qu,t3_esqaoa,1579793117.0,"I loved every bit of this episode. I loved that they're acknowledging Picard's age and that he's no longer as physically capable as he used to be, but his mind is as sharp as ever. He's softened a bit and seems more fatherly. I love that he has a dog named Number One (bonus points that's he's a lovable pit bull, a carry over from Stewart's own dog fostering history). I teared up at many parts, but especially when Picard told Dream Data that he didn't want the game to end.  I simply cannot wait until next week. I'm sort of glad that they didn't drop all the episodes at once. It gives me a chance to digest what I just watched and watch it again (and again?)."

nyc,ff9m40i,t3_ese1ig,1579715870.0,"I love NYC, I'm a 3rd generation NYer, but I really think I'm going to have to leave, eventually. But I have no idea where to go. I'm on disability because of a degenerative spinal condition, so meeting rent every month is becoming more and more difficult on a fixed income. I don't have a car and now *can't* drive because of my spinal condition. So anyplace I'd end up would most likely be expensive because I need public transportation. Plus, NYC has the best medical care, which I need. My doctors are fantastic and I don't know what awaits in the ""outside world"". Sort of a catch-22."

duolingo,ff9h5oj,t1_ff2zs7x,1579712918.0,"I totally get the two dialects. I live in NYC so we have both here, although most of my friends that I would practice with are PR. I do find both a little too fast for me.  I'm thinking of watching some Spanish language kid's shows, like Sesame Street in Spanish. I also may turn on the Spanish dubbing on some of my favorite movies that I've seen 100 times (maybe Star Trek in Spanish?) I'm having great difficulty with the verbal parts. My BFF jokingly said I ""Bloomberged"" a sentence (reference to Michael Bloomberg, lol).
Note: I'm not super young and I know the older you get the harder it is to learn. I also have ADD, which is why I chose Duo, because it's micro lessons that I can manage to pay attention to."
BipolarReddit,ff9gcze,t3_esej0r,1579712429.0,"If you're in the US, I would answer a hard **no** for that one. I've had way too many experiences where even friendly bosses and HR people have fucked me over big time when I revealed my diagnoses. The stigma in the workplace is very real and can effect your job even more than your actual condition can.   
Acceptance is currently for close friends and family, not for the workplace. It's very sad and unfortunate for us, but it's the way the system works. We have very little protection.  

My advice, if you need to take time off, just get a doctor's note. Use your sick leave if you must, but say you're sick with something. If you're female, you have a monthly excuse to call out for feminine issues, but keep your cards (pun intended) close to your chest when it comes to your condition. Take your meds, practice self care, text a friend or come on Reddit to vent."

BipolarReddit,ff5pbqv,t3_ernxer,1579604514.0,"In hindsight, my earliest depression was at about age 9. Mania came later at about 12 or 13.

See *that's* the problem with smaller purchases. You think afterwards. ""Whelp, it's only $100, I'll take the hit and keep \[whatever you bought\]."" Whereas if you bought a $7,000 sound system, you might return it. It's a slippery slope. I had an episode mid summer last year and bought a ridiculous amount of Funko Pops (my newest addiction) over a 2 month period. I'm trying my best to hold it together because I really need good credit."
