dogs,ff3usc8,t3_ergfcc,1579549308.0,"My dog had OSA and went through 3 rounds of carboplatin post-amp. I discussed this with my primary vet and onc too. 

I didn't feed meals raw but our treats, previously, had been things like beef trachea, chicken and rabbit feet, etc so I was told to hold off until we confirmed she was past her nadir. Essentially, those things were okay'd the day of chemo and off-limits the next day and through until her granulocyte counts were rebounding. I don't know if your dog is doing carbo (some folks do doxorubicin) but a common side effect profile can be severe bone marrow suppression and, thus, immunoprotective cells take a huge hit.

Our onco told some of her clients fed raw regardless but you both need to have that convo together. Pen's nadir was always very late and she was typically pancytopenic so we never deviated from her Pro Plan meals. Inappetence was transient (post-chemo days 2 and 3) and those were canned green tripe days.

Amp + chemo is still the gold standard for canine OSA but I assure you that will be changing in the next several years. They are a model for this same cancer in children and there is some promising research behind both.

Speak to your onc about the canine OSA vaccines and whether you are candidates. There is a HER2/Neu and a EGFR/HER2. Dr. Mark Mamula is a person you may wish to contact ([Mark.mamula@yale.edu](mailto:Mark.mamula@yale.edu)) as he runs a small, partially funded OSA vaccine trial and those dogs are showing good immune responses. We did obtain that vaccine but found out her mets were so aggressive and so disseminated that she would never live to mount the antibodies needed to fight them all. 

For your reading, the initial murine study is "" Epidermal growth factor receptor peptide vaccination induces crossreactive immunity to human EGFR, HER2, and HER3"".

Dog-friendly housing is location, time, and budget dependent. Not to mention BREED and SIZE dependent.

It's easy to say it is doable but it can certainly be difficult.

So, yes, a few of those people can temporarily leave their dog with friends/family or make the tough choice to give them up.
