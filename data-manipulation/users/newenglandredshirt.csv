I actually went the other way. This is my first year in MS after many years in HS. (I'll change my flair eventually) i spent the last 5 years teaching 9th and now I'm teaching 8th. 

Admin involvement is significantly less in high school, for better and for worse. They tend to let you just teach, but they are also less responsive with behavior. This might just be the schools I have personally experienced, though.

But depending on the size of your district, transferring may not be easy. Feel free to PM me if you want more info. I'm happy to help!"

But most importantly, find your *voice.* every teacher has a Teacher Voice. Figure out who you are and who you *want to be* in front of the classroom. There is absolutely *no fucking way* you should feel self-conscious right now. Every single professional teacher has been where you are now.
