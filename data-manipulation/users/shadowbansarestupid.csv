news,ffmd654,t1_ffmcb9o,1580052707.0,"So very true. And I think the other thing that needs to be brought up is that, more than likely, the number of ""gun nuts"" significantly outnumber the number of more rational gun owners when you just look at the average level of training and expertise gun owners in America have. It absolutely blows my mind how people can get a conceal carry license but can barely hit a target at 15 yards."

UIUC,ffi1p08,t1_ffhm2b8,1579962444.0,Gonna be walking in circles considering the flu is spreading around campus like mad right now.
UIUC,ffgjvhr,t1_ffgja73,1579907911.0,"And again, I ask you, how do you know that they aren't improving the offer over time? All you're doing is speculating that the job offer has remained the exact same over the entire time the posting has been open. And you realize the absolutely massive pit you're opening up by now saying psychiatrists will be hired at 500k vs the standard 250k right? Because now every single psychiatrist that comes to Champaign HAS to be offered 500k and therefore, you're only ever going to hire half as many as you potentially could by waiting for the right person to come along. 

Not only that, you again fail to accept that there is a nationwide shortage of psychiatrists. This is not a Champaign only problem. This is a nationwide problem. UI just opened up its residency program in 2017 to help handle the additional demand. Then you have the issue of once they finish their residency, a good chunk of them don't even want to deal with college aged students. Please stop oversimplifying the issue and realize it is a much more difficult issue at hand. 

I've mentioned this many times in the past, but if you actually want to know what is going on with McKinley, join the student advisory board. Dr. Parker has always sided with the students, and he will always explain everything with complete transparency."
UIUC,ffgi6w8,t1_ffghtf8,1579906800.0,"You're definitely oversimplifying the issue at hand. If you ask any student around here if they want to stay in Champaign and work here, there's a VERY good chance that they will say hell no and want to bail to Chicago or elsewhere. Psychiatry is in absolutely high demand all over the nation, and they have their choice of where they want to go AND they will make an absolute killing in terms of income as well. Money doesn't mean shit if you don't enjoy where you're living at. Traveling 2+ hours to do anything is a shitty ass lifestyle that few are willing to do. If you actually DID know what was going on behind the scenes, McKinley has actively been searching for mental health support for over 2 years. They actually DID have someone on board, but they ended up turning down the job at the last second to work elsewhere. Furthermore, McKinley has been exploring telemedicine by creating an office for people to have telemedicine sessions within McKinley."
UIUC,ffg5bmc,t1_fffug51,1579898781.0,"How do you know that though? Do you actually know the specifics of the offer or are you just speculating? Because my sister is a psychiatrist and actually did get the job offer notice here, and it's pretty damn good. People just don't want to move here."
UIUC,fffk0i0,t3_etazmp,1579885621.0,"I am curious. Do people think that UIUC isn't actively seeking out psychiatrists? While I agree that the raise was absolutely absurd, you can't really force people to move to the middle of nowhere if they don't want to, especially when there is a nationwide shortage."

HomeImprovement,fetpr7e,t1_fetok2h,1579378116.0,"Sounds good, thanks. I wasn't sure if there was like some independent control like with hot water baseboard heaters that I needed to mess with. Any clue on the efficiency of the built in AC unit versus baseboard heaters? I was honestly surprised with how expensive my last electric bill was ($100+ for what I would estimate is a 700sq ft apartment) considering I was gone for 2 weeks. Granted, my landlord did renovate my bathroom during that time, but I can't imagine a week of renovations would drive up the bill that much, especially considering it was one of the warmest decembers yet (60\*F on Christmas day)."
HomeImprovement,fetoejv,t1_fetob2r,1579377592.0,"There is, but it is putting out like absolutely no heat compared to the living room heater. I can feel it slightly warm up, but it's not hot to the touch."
HomeImprovement,feto7wn,t1_fetnyas,1579377517.0,"That is what my landlord suggested, but I feel like this is more putting a bandaid on the problem rather than fixing it. I don't feel like this would really work since the air needs to go from my living room, make a 90 degree turn through the hallway, then another 90 degree turn to reach the bedroom/bathroom."
3gun,fesug0w,t1_fesu5ca,1579369109.0,"I definitely would push you towards PCC then because a 25 yard 3 gun range is going to be hosing stages. You'll be burning through ammo fast. You can get some pretty solid PCCs for under 1K, and you can compete in both USPSA and 3 gun."
3gun,festltq,t1_fest85s,1579368905.0,3 gun really not a good competition if you're on a budget. Costs soooo much to practice. Why don't you look into PCC then? Arguably one of the divisions that everyone enjoys the most while being cheap af.

watercooling,fdk362q,t1_fdjvxqz,1578494928.0,Then the pump is likely bad. It shouldn't be anywhere near that loud.
watercooling,fdj6wv1,t1_fdj6o2i,1578460150.0,Record a video without the vibration then. It's too hard to judge the noise if the vibration is the dominant noise. You really shouldn't be able to hear the pump very much.
watercooling,fdj6lzr,t1_fdj2peb,1578459905.0,Is the noise from the pump or the res vibrating? I am confused. Does the noise improve if you touch/dampen the res or pump?
