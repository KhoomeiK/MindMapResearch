He'd run around the back yard with our Border Collie for hours and be fine.  But after a ten seconds of barking like an idiot when the door bell rang he was suddenly gasping for breath  and struggling to keep his frail body alive.  Of course the attacks only happened if you yelled at him...

videos,ff7c4hv,t1_ff78aek,1579646083.0,"Option C, being happy it's whole life and living to a ripe old age?

That's not really an option.  In the US hunting is necessary to preserve the health and happiness of animal populations.  You can try to argue that ""nature will balance itself out"" but that is literally impossible as long as human as part of the equation.  We are naturally in unbalancing force.  So the best we can do is try to restore order.

Let's look at Wisconsin deer as an example.  Around 200,000 deer are harvested a year.  Every year.  That is to preserve herd health.  Adding 200,000 deer a year would quickly lead to a massive decline in the quality of life of the individual animal.  Would there eventually be a balance?  Possibly, but it would come in the form of massive starvation or overkilling by the big predators like wolves that would take advantage of weakened and aging herds.  It wouldn't just be long happy lives."
UpliftingNews,ff6m0jf,t1_ff6gt7f,1579630063.0,"Mental health check is only a good idea on paper.  Psychological diagnosis  is EXTREMELY subjective.  I've been through that wringer enough times to know that there is no possible way you could institute a reliable mental health screening.

Look at how well trying to limit medicinal weed in California worked.  There were medical clinics that were set up exclusively to diagnose you with something that you could get a card for.  Similar set ups would spring up immediately for rubber stamping gun purchases.  And similarly, it's just as easy to find an ""expert witness"" that will diagnose someone with something to disqualify them after a 20 minute interview.  

I don't like the idea of crazy people having guns.  I really really don't.  But honestly, even in a best case scenario, the only people you could disqualify are the people that no reasonable gun dealer would sell a weapon do anyway.  If you're lucid enough to get yourself to a gun store and put money on the counter, you're lucid enough to pass a minimum psych eval."

self,fdht69w,t1_fdhr4py,1578429701.0,"I assume pretty much all self posts are at least 60% fabrications.  It's not the ridiculous ones that convince me, it's the mundane ones that sound EXACTLY like what the users wants to hear.  For example, waaaay too many stories about atheist/LGBTQ kids getting kicked out or otherwise abused by their parents that weirdly check all of the same boxes.  I know it does happen, and fairly commonly, but the stories feel so manufactured to get the most sympathy or cause the most outrage.  I'll even believe someone did get kicked out, but the story itself is always so suspect in its telling.

The other one that weary of seeing is the ""I'm black but I hate black people"" post.  Some version of it rises to the top of one of the popular subs every month or so.  Many of these posters have been outed as white people flexing their racism.  That post is always so rote that I'm baffled anyone that has been on this site for more than a year can't basically recite it when it comes up.

All of the specific subreddits have their own recurring posts.  JustNoMIL, AITA, RaisedByNarcissists, and ChoosingBeggars are the worst offenders I see regularly.  Atheist, and anti-religion subs are also really bad, as are a lot of the survivor/minority/heath problem support subs.  Basically any sub with a big self post count has the same problem.  People learn the formula, create a thin persona, and then get off on the flood of sympathy or anger, or support they get.  Some people are sick and twisted, some people are just bored, some people, probably people like OP, just like creating an emotional journey they can take people on.  Like a real life game of D&D but no one but you knows it's just a role playing game."

I find this phenomenon is often the case when people complain about under representation in any area.  Blame large scale societal problems on small groups or individuals is just shouting to hear yourself shout.  We would like to see more female scientists, we may even agree that more female scientists deserve pages.  But if no one will write a decent wikipedia page, and if no one is writing articles, and if there are significantly less female scientists, and if the university system is inhospitable to female STEM majors, and if biological differences in sexes push people towards different careers, etc, etc... then endless complaining does nothing.

My wife is part of a theatre program in a very progressive town that is constantly trying to perform plays with high representation of sexual, gender, ability, and racial minorities, which everyone agrees is extremely important.  However, they literally have to BEG people no acting background to come be in plays because there actually is close 0 member of the theatre community to fill those roles (except gay men, most gay men have to play straight 90% of the time).

The article has a lot of good information but just comes to some very unsupported conclusions.  Nearly all of the sources are advocates for women in science that are actively trying to push females into the spotlight.

>Some of the issues Wade encountered creating Phelps’ biography, he says, are ‘representative of how much harder it is to create articles for women than for men, because there are fewer citations to use, as people write less about the achievements of women’.

>her name didn’t appear in the articles announcing tennessine’s discovery. She wasn’t profiled by mainstream media. Most mentions of her work are on her employer’s website – a source that’s not classed as independent by Wikipedia standards and therefore not admissible when it comes to establishing notability. 

No one who reported on her team felt her contribution was worth reporting.  In fact, Joseph Hamilton, who is quoted on the [wikipedia article for the element she worked on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessine#Discovery) as the ""the father of 117"" for all his work in the discovery doesn't his own page.  In fact, as far as I can tell there are only two people who worked extensively on the discovery that DO have pages, and one of them is [is a woman.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Shaughnessy)

I absolutely agree that being female shouldn't disqualify you from being recognized for your accomplishments.  However, being the first black woman to work on a team that did something great shouldn't elevate your contributions above every other team member.  If everyone on the team had a page but her then that would be a problem.  If she's the only minor member of the team getting a page, that's also a problem."
wikipedia,fdeipiy,t1_fdeegkw,1578339869.0,"> For example, a woman scientist who won the Nobel prize was not ""notable"" enough to have a Wikipedia page but the men who co-won it with her were.

Both of those men already had pages before they won the prize.  She she didn't get a page until after she won the prize.  Before she won she was not as accomplished and didn't met the criteria.  Your comment is making it sound like after he prize was awarded they made pages for the two men and not for her, which is not only inaccurate, but contrary to what is in the article you are attempting to summarize.
