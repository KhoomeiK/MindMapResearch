HaveWeMet,ffogpn5,t1_ffnks69,1580077452.0,I was so scared too and I bought 4. But I gave them away last holidays because I was just feeling that everyone else would appreciate them. Apparently driving our cars is more dangerous but I go by moose or taxi.

offmychest,ffobwtm,t3_eu8xd0,1580076054.0,"He’s ashamed to look at any of his behaviours and turns everything back to you, a narcissist trait, that we can all do to protect ourselves. I’m glad you shared your rant and I really hope that you two can sit down and go over some expectations. 

(Story time)I used to work part time, taking the kids with me and tend to the all child care. My ex used to get so angry when dinner wasn’t ready, when things weren’t tidy, when laundry wasn’t done(how should I know you’re out of underwear if you don’t say so). But I never knew what they were actually upset about-we’d never had any previous discussion that they’d love to have dinner ready, or any other tasks assisted with and the feelings around that, and I didn’t understand what the anger was about until I finally got it out of him. And times I’d make a really beautiful dinner (or so I thought) but it wasn’t good enough or I didn’t make enough. I had no idea. When I tried hard I still failed and exhausted myself in the process. With my second partner I was very clear to say I don’t do laundry for others and I barely cook (due to my now having a limiting belief that I simply couldn’t cook/made bad food) 

Anyway tmi but what I learned was that having gentle conversations from both sides is so important to understand what someone else feels. If you can both agree to set up a future conversation, this is helpful to allow each other an opportunity to prepare and not jump to being defensive. (I have some really important things I want to talk about on Tuesday that are hard for me to say, would that time/day work for you?) then, be gentle and express yourselves without blame statements. “When x happens I feel y, could we find a compromise?” 

It takes practice and time, and mixing in old mouldy bags of hurt and pain from mental illness and whatever else can make it challenging, but it is possible. I cook now, quite happily. 

TLDR: when reality exceeds expectations, people lose their shit. Be gentle w/each other and yourself and work on communication and compromise.  And rant away anytime as an outlet!

Edit: a word"
AmItheAsshole,ffo1ytl,t3_eu2hnd,1580073343.0,ESH. You’re beautiful and amazing and your parents probably want memories. It’s hard because illness impacts everyone close to a person not just the person. I hope you can heal and find peace and see your own unique qualities and find love for yourself. Then the photos won’t matter. Just remember. You’re beautiful and amazing.
AmItheAsshole,ffnzufw,t3_euadqi,1580072762.0,"YTA. But mostly because you’re not establishing a good relationship with your teen and instead just teaching him to hide things better, or lie better. I can understand this is infuriating but this technique doesn’t teach him that his choices have consequences (skipping school leads to poor grades, leads to...) and instead just make you the bad guy. (My parent is an a$$hole) Check out love and logic for teens. Highly recommended it."

legaladvicecanada,ffjvuyt,t1_ffjtpkr,1580008365.0,Toilet guy will have liability insurance which would cover damages to other units as a result of his leak. I’m pretty sure your odds are good. But it may take a lot of time and some money to file. Very worth consulting a lawyer to at least get some info.
legaladvicecanada,ffjr9xh,t3_etydj9,1580004868.0,"This is where an insurance company is helpful. In this scenario they would basically sue the other insurance company for the cost of the repair to your unit. 

You might be able to present the bill or repair quote to his insurance, if they are willing to work with you. And if that neighbour didn’t have home owners insurance, good luck. I’d assume you would then be filing small claims(depending on extent of damages) against him directly but actually getting those funds could be challenging. Be sure to photograph all damaged items and property and keep your receipts for repairs if any yet. Hopefully you can come to an agreement. (NAL)"
