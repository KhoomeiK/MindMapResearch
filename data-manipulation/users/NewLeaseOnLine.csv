HumanForScale,fgoi7vn,t3_ezc333,1580970896.0,"Impressive, and yet at the same time, annoying.

The commercial aviation industry really is stuck in the Bronze Age. Think about it:

First flight in 1903, by midway through WWI we had highly manoeuvrable biplanes, and just 20 years later towards the end of WWII the Nazis had mastered jet propulsion with jet-powered aircraft in operation.

It only took 4 decades to go from nothing to propellers to jets, yet it's now been 8 decades of jet engines.

The basic scientific process of jet propulsion is fundamentally no different than it was 80 years ago. In fact, commercial air travel today is actually slower than it was 30-40 years ago.

Commercially, jets are just a more complex version of a fan wrapped inside a giant tube to form a combustion process while precariously hanging off a wing hanging off an even bigger tube full of people and cargo.

There has been no significant progress or groundbreaking development. Only minor changes over time that were inevitable. Two decades ago the aerospace industry talked up future commercial air travel between destinations like Sydney and New York taking only 4 hours. Today that research has long been abandoned and silenced. It's as dead as the Concorde.

The research and development of superior and aeronautically viable forms of propulsion for commercial air travel are deliberately obstructed and unfunded by commercial aviation because it's more profitable to squeeze you into a giant sardine can than it is to get you to your destination faster.

The only reason passengers spend so long in the air today is a financially motivated one, and international airports are designed to reflect this. Think about that. It's only circumstance that we actually spend longer traveling by air today than people did two generations ago.

Looking at this image is more depressing than impressive.

Next time you're 30,000 ft up squashed in like a smoked oyster, or enjoying your smoked oyster, while marveling at the wonders of modern technology as you spend unnecessary hours in a giant tube in the sky, just be aware that in a parallel universe aviation is much *much* more advanced because greed took a backseat to progress.

TL;DR: modern commercial air travel sux"
