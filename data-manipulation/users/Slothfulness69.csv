AskReddit,ffkaac4,t1_ffivwt2,1580019514.0,"Omg I was the kid in this story but at 16. We had just moved into a new house and I got my period early, but all the pads and stuff were in my parents bathroom. My dad had gone to bed early that night, before my mom, so I went to their door and knocked gently enough for my mom to hear but trying not to wake my dad. I heard my mom say something but I couldn’t make out what, so I opened the door and walked in. 

I walked right up to their bed before realizing my mom was on top of my dad. Then I didn’t know what to do because if my dad looked up, he would see me very clearly in the moonlight. So I walked into their bathroom to hide and formulate a plan. Could I lay down in the bathtub until they went to sleep? Could I hide behind the door? As I’m standing there thinking, my mom comes in to use the bathroom and she’s like “...” and I was like “my period came early ._. I need pads” and my dad was like “(Mom’s name?)” and then I walked out to leave with my pads and he scrambled to get his blanket on to cover himself. I was so embarrassed."
childfree,ffigi2v,t1_ffi3byd,1579973315.0,All eggs are fertilized in the Fallopian tubes. But they’re meant to implant in the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy is when they implant in the Fallopian tubes instead because they’re confused.

Also, I have to brag about this, one time I went to get a pedicure and they had a “drop your business card to win a free facial” thing in the front. I checked and it didn’t have a company name and it wasn’t a facial offered by the salon. So on my way out, I grabbed the thing, with probably like 60-80 cards, and threw it away when I got home lol. I like to think I saved someone."

AskReddit,ffh812n,t1_ffh1o9d,1579925740.0,"That’s okay, I completely understand why you would respond that way. I didn’t mention it in my post because it wasn’t relevant, but I’ve also struggled with depression for about 10 years (which doesn’t sound that long, but it’s about half my entire life lol) and had suicidal thoughts before and stuff. I would never try to downplay the significance and difficulty of it. That’s also the reason I think we need to change overall, like more access to therapy, better economic conditions, less focus on profits and more focus on people. I think for a lot of people, their mental health would improve if our society was different. 

Also, a good response to people who say “someone else has it worse” is “someone else also has it better, does that mean I can’t enjoy things in my life?” I hope you don’t internalize it. A lot of people are still ignorant about mental illness so they think depression is just sadness, which can be fixed easily, as opposed to an actual disease/disorder that’s harder to treat or cure. So don’t let other people define your experiences with your body and its health problems, including mental illness."
