AbsoluteUnits,ffil032,t1_ffikknc,1579976390.0,I feel that this makes for a shitty experience.

EverythingScience,ffdrwz1,t1_ffdcofy,1579827422.0,"As a species, I believe you to be right. I look around and see rampant ignorance in enough individuals to cancel out the wisdom in the remainder.  We don’t have enough collective intelligence to do what needs to be done, so nature will do it for us. Humanity will survive this, but it won’t be a walk in the park.  The growing pains will be clearly evident, and many individuals will pay dearly."

nihilism,ff6vvkr,t3_erovjf,1579635952.0,"I don’t know what, if anything you enjoy. If you haven’t done it, try communing more with nature, or try living a bit on the edge. Mountain climbing, white water kayaking, skiing, mountain biking, even walking or running; do you have opportunity to do any of this?  It doesn’t have to be high end, either. It’s always made me feel alive , though, even in my worst times.  Physical activity and staying healthy and strong can keep you centered in contentment, even when your not content.  Also take up an instrument, even if it’s a harmonica. Become proficient at it, or work at becoming proficient. As Rom Doss said, “Be here now”. Come outside your shell and help and relate to others. Share your joys. Relate. You’re doing that now. It’s a beginning. 

See your moments as sacred, and your moments will treat you as sacred. 

Take your lessons from nature. All moments are sacred to  tree, in that it’s always at peace with itself. Be the tree, and be at peace with all your moments."

bizarrebuildings,ff6llby,t1_ff5q5au,1579629802.0,I want one. Looks like it supported by steel beams.
science,ff5ytxz,t3_ernk8d,1579614623.0,"I’m 70, and I’ve never written about this before. 

I was in Vietnam for one year. This is what I learned. The military is filled with jerks. Drugs and alcohol are abused by the vast majority on a daily basis. Atrocities are committed by your fellow soldiers against you, each other, and their allies. People are people no matter where they are born or what religion they are brought up in, and the vast majority of men lose a part of their morality in war zones. Sexual perversion is rampant. If you’re a young male, stay away if you wish to keep your soul intact and healthy.
It took me  20 years to gain back my self respect and worth after that experience, and I was lucky to come out alive and in one piece."
