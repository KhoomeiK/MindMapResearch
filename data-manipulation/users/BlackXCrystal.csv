AmItheAsshole,ff4xrfq,t3_erijgn,1579574993.0,"NTA I could almost understand your sister wanting to keep something like the venue just for the pure convenience. However, taking every aspect of it (especially if she might not pay you back for it) and possibly the dress to is quite uncalled for. And I imagine it would be hard for you to attend what would practically be your wedding.
