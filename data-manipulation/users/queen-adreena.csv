We know that Barry expressed exasperation that being female was the only thing holding him back from becoming a soldier or a doctor. We know that as a female, Barry could never have pursued what was obviously an intense calling and fantastic ability.

Either way, making blanket assertions risks erasing a struggle. If you declare 'he was obviously trans', it potentially erases a struggle for a woman inside a patriarchal society to pursue their calling via clever subterfuge; if you declare 'it was obviously a disguise for career reasons' then you too risk erasing a potential trans identity.
