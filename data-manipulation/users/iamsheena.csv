I used to have a cat that my mom said with scratch the shit out of any vet who tried to examine him, resulting in many bans until he finally found his connection with one and would be placated."
Teachers,fgmddr1,t3_ez8pnc,1580922397.0,"I'm not comfortable saying it so I don't say it but I will say ""N"" just to show I've acknowledged it and we usually take a moment to discuss why it's used. One class I'm thinking of had a large group of very proud black girls who always loved discussing race and never flinched away from the language but kissed their teeth when it came up and you could always hear their whispered comments.

I don't think anyone should use the excuse of it's written so it needs to be said. There needs to be discussion.

But I'm also of the mind that I won't read the swears most of the time either and will just say ""B"" or ""F"" because if any student went around reciting something with swears because that's how it's written, they would undoubtedly get in trouble."
Teachers,fgfg7qc,t3_exzuor,1580737830.0,"At my old high school and at the high school I did my practicum at, it was the same 4 periods every day for half the year and would change in the winter.

So you would teach 3 out of 4 periods and then have a prep. Odd days would be ABCD and even days would be BADC but you were always guaranteed a prep and I don't understand why this concept is so difficult in most schools. Having a class for half a year is awesome because if you struggle with them, they're gone in the new year! I always preferred that timetable to anything else."
crafts,fg7hdgr,t3_excs7w,1580592555.0,I don't really have a suggestion but wanted to say I really like it.
BeAmazed,ffrly2y,t1_ffr0109,1580160771.0,I recently realised that Oreos use palm oil and it doesn't have a rainforest certified label so I can't eat them and it makes me sad. I love Oreos.

BrandNewSentence,fffp9rw,t1_fffn1ai,1579888838.0,Luckily mine only did this in the summer when the vents weren't in use. We were able to block his access after that.
BrandNewSentence,fffffm2,t1_fff0n75,1579882792.0,My cat used to pry up the heating vents and go exploring in the vent system and then meow to be saved and we'd have to call him to the nearest accessible wall vent and unscrew it and let him out.
AskWomen,ffff0fl,t1_fffb62j,1579882530.0,"Winters are definitely not hot. Summers can get hot.

Idk about Alberta though, I'm from Winnipeg so I just assumed Alberta would get hot too."

relationship_advice,ff6kc78,t3_ertsws,1579629041.0,He's an insecure douche canoe and you shouldn't change anything to placate him. I would not keep him around if he's making you feel self-conscious. He needs to get over himself.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fezug5t,t3_eqw3fi,1579461800.0,I loved working at IKEA because the music was always bopping. But like 90s and earlier bops.
aww,fexu5f1,t1_fewzkj7,1579436284.0,Idk some cats are dicks and some cats are sweethearts. You can't say all cats are one or the other because they're all so distinct in how they act.
hamiltonmusical,fexosjj,t3_eqqedd,1579434196.0,"I've seen it twice. Once was on my own where I got a ticket for £57 and was at the back of the floor seats.

AskWomen,fek5uvk,t1_fek04le,1579193243.0,Not everyone handles stress in the same way. Some people can't stop thinking about an issue or anxiety at work while others can leave it all behind as soon as they step out of the building. It's not fair to assume that just because you are able to do X that everyone should be able to do X.

AskWomen,feh479o,t1_feg806a,1579108792.0,Try organising a first date where you're doing something other than just talking. That always made me feel more comfortable.
AskWomen,feh3z71,t3_eoy958,1579108661.0,"Online dating. I had made many plans to meet several people via online dating but chickened out every time (at least in the UK -- attempts back in Canada led to nothing). Finally someone messaged me who was fine with not just meeting for a drink (chatting in that kind of setting makes me feel uncomfortable) and we went to mini golf and walked around and talked and now celebrated a year together in November. Plans to move in soon.

Now to just make friends..."
killthosewhodisagree,fefwiyh,t3_eoqavv,1579067508.0,"Even as satire, there are too many people who believe everyone in the US should be able to do X or be thrown out of the country/killed and these are the same people who are against something like communism or dictatorships where people are imprisoned or killed if they don't do what everyone else is doing. It's like... choose one."
AskWomen,fe1ukkz,t1_fe1jnm8,1578831053.0,"Exactly. Being lonely in a room filled with people is a very real thing, even if there is conversation. Not being heard, or when you're ignored, eats at you and makes you feel insignificant."

AskWomen,fe0atcg,t1_fdyckx9,1578808070.0,"I think loneliness and solitude are very different things. Solitude is calming and inviting and empowering. Loneliness is hopelessness and sad and feeling desperate for human interaction.

Leaning into being alone and enjoying solitude is good but actual loneliness is far worse.

I enjoy being alone and often am. But every once in a while I need to talk to someone and vent or feel heard and that's when loneliness sets in."

Some students, I understand because they're from different lives before and don't fully understand the language, but others are baffling.

But a lot of kids will have a phone before they have a computer so they're learning a different set of skills that aren't transferrable."
Teachers,fdqsygr,t3_emsgxd,1578674209.0,They're soooo terrible with computers. Like they turn the screen on and off and think the whole thing is going on and off. I don't remember this ever bein a problem with my peers and I growing up in the late 90s/early 2000s. This is age 11 to 14 year olds.
