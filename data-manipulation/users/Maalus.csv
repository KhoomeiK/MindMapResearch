Warhammer40k,ffqaj9f,t1_ffq9jc9,1580128269.0,I did target the drones. The commander was a character so I couldn't do anything else.
Grimdank,ffq446y,t1_ffq40ur,1580119392.0,">the license to some larger and more experienced companies

I mean, if some indie phone company had it, I doubt a larger one couldn't afford it. It seems like the bigger companies simply didn't want a warhammer game."
Grimdank,ffq2lv4,t1_ffptn4l,1580116962.0,"OOTL here, but didn't GW throw the license around to everyone willing to make something of it? That's why there's a ton of mobile games from WH40k, including a chess game."
Pimax,ffq1gkv,t3_euks22,1580115173.0,[Is it?](https://community.openmr.ai/) Seems fine to me. They migrated their forum over to some other framework.

Warhammer40k,ffpxytu,t1_ffpdvlx,1580110294.0,"How do you counter drones though? Was playing tsons vs chaos vs tau, my brother had 4 shield drones around a commander in a vulnerable spot flanking the chaos player, so I deepstrike scarab occult, smite, rapidfire 2x s4 ap-2 x5 termies, make the charge to go into meele with them (couldn't hit the commander because he was outside 1 inch) 10 more attacks, and nothing went through to hit them."
catsthegame,ffpx9is,t1_ffppx1c,1580109399.0,"Stop spreading bullshit for the sake of trying to be funny, because you aren't. The laser is 2.5 times the damage specified in its stats, which shoots after 2.5s chargeup time."
AskReddit,ffp45qm,t1_ffp053n,1580085785.0,No. Both were downright evil. Stop making excuses for war criminals.
Pimax,ffp1ybu,t3_eudi1j,1580084544.0,"The cracking issue will never be solved without a headset redesign. Sharp corners accumulate stress, which causes the cracking issue. Same reason why aircraft windows are round, and not square."
Warhammer40k,ffhtelj,t1_ffgsknu,1579952963.0,"TTS is great for battles like these because of the space limitations. On PC, nothing is too big."

Grimdank,ffbzh3g,t1_ffbrugv,1579787587.0,"Wasn't that the issue multiple times before the Horus Heresy? I distinctly remember human societies who worked with xenos, and refused to discard them when the Imperium came to visit."
CoOpGaming,ffblmd6,t3_esmr32,1579771365.0,"Sub is way too small for that imho. Stick to cooptimus for the reviews / top lists, and talk about the games / coop in general in here."
Pimax,ff9qz1n,t1_ff9q7gz,1579719103.0,"They won't completely destroy the headset unless you hit it with something, in which case the hit destroys it, not the cracks. They might in theory refract the light differently and interfere with tracking. In the real world though, cosmetic mostly. Still sucks."
Pimax,ff8n4s3,t1_ff76z0g,1579686867.0,"No, it won't protect the headset. Pimax cracks because of the sharp angles. Same reason why airplane windows have round corners, not sharp ones. A corner is a point where all the stress acumulates. You can have a really thick plastic piece, and it will always crack, sooner or later. Plastic isn't an issue here."

gaming,ff2xixf,t1_ff2vndt,1579527780.0,"Nah, he is an actual asshole. Says gamers are parasites, and that his books would've been famous without the games - which is an obvious lie. They were well known in Poland by fantasy enthusiasts, but nothing more, and were on their way to being forgotten in the next 10 years."
Pimax,ff2x7oo,t3_eraup1,1579527484.0,"It's the Pimax's ipd. I have 67 measured by a doctor, and are running \~64 because that's what feels comfortable to me, and allows me to see clearly. Try adjusting it till you see stuff well, instead of setting it to a concrete number."

Pimax,fezb4fa,t3_eqz347,1579455575.0,"Same. I updated pitool from 180 to latest from yesterday, it froze, then when I restarted pitool, it started a firmware update (even though I checked beforehand and there was nothing), and now it's stuck at 100% upgrading.

Edit: after a firmware update, I can indeed change the lightbar colour. Fun!"
