technicallythetruth,fgkg49h,t1_fgkfhwp,1580864765.0,Babies are pretty resilient especially if you don't want them. That's a one way ticket to fetal alcoholic syndrome and a very risky child birth. Better to just get an abortion.
aww,fghv1u2,t1_fghu4fe,1580794710.0,And you need more than one or they'll die of loneliness.
worldnews,fghuard,t1_fghpopb,1580794075.0,"Thank you, I've been saying this since Myspace went under. It's clear to see how Reddit is functionally bad for peoples mental health, let alone Facebook et al. Yet the dopamine hit is just too addictive. We consume ourselves when connected to so many people. Reddit only works because you're only ever connecting with a couple hundred people per thread, but zoom out and you start to see the circle jerks, the meme sweatshops, political bias run amok, privacy concerns, and the endless scrolling to satisfy the information vacuum to name a few. Society is eventually going to have to face regional tribalism for entertainment purposes if we want the internet to continue to exist."
aww,fghstlf,t1_fgh7xjt,1580792849.0,My son has been walking since 10 months. He's about 13 months now. Did you enjoy your extra time in the non-moving stage? I can't leave this kid anywhere.
gaming,fgh7n1z,t1_fggss5e,1580778596.0,"Right? Lol I'm a PC bro but a poor one, I run pretty much every game sub 30. It's a processor bottleneck. You get used to it."
television,fgebhy4,t1_fge7qwl,1580695782.0,OP mentioned not including political ads.
books,fgd16d4,t1_fgbrkve,1580678026.0,"Haha I can tell you that was not the case with most people. Ask anyone, reading in school killed all motivation to read. That's the sad part about public school, even today. They force kids to read books they don't enjoy and it takes the fun out of reading. I fell in love with reading at 22. Prior to that I ""hated"" it."

RimWorld,fgbpc8v,t1_fgbm7wn,1580664752.0,"Or form an assault, which is what I'm doing. I agree sometimes the events are are a pain in the ass, I currently have 2 seige camps attacking me periodically, have bubble shields so they are just a minor annoyance."
skyrim,fgba83q,t1_fgb89js,1580659980.0,Make a beneficial potion with a paralysis secondary. Can't give an example other than that.
funny,fgawwvz,t1_fg971lx,1580656300.0,"My first thought was, why did they not stain that area at the top of the stairs?"
gifs,fg8ezmi,t1_fg80hid,1580617534.0,"Walk in and asked to be induced. My wife started going into labor 2 hours after the first dose of cervical ripener.  
  
Either way good luck and congratulations."
skyrim,fg8eia9,t1_fg87psy,1580617134.0,"The fade shout is meant for that, although you can't do it while falling so you might have a point. Yes you can drink the paralysis poison that you would normally apply to weapons."
dataisbeautiful,fg8eabw,t1_fg8blkk,1580616953.0,More of a seafoam green imo
books,fg8djdn,t1_fg85ugm,1580616345.0,"Oh man I love when that happens, conditions have to be just right for me. I find myself comprehending the words before I even read them, essentially reading the sentence after the sentence I'm currently reading. Then you're kind of just sliding down a hill until you snap out of it and realize you just read 30 pages without even thinking.  
  
Mostly I read aloud when I can or slow my reading to read aloud in my head. Dialogue between characters is my heroin."
AskReddit,fg5pb8r,t1_fg4j7ib,1580534095.0,We had a machine in my apartment that if you took a butter knife and stuck it in a seam you could lift up the lever that the coin mechanism would trip. Just lift the level and press start. Worked like a charm.
AskReddit,fg5owav,t1_fg3u5km,1580533709.0,"This is pretty accurate. My mother in law has a pretty modest war chest. My wife is an only child and her dad died when she was very young. MIL has stated that when she dies we get everything. It's probably not going to happen for a long time, but its comfortable knowing we'll eventually come into that."
AskReddit,fg5og8a,t1_fg4wbcl,1580533303.0,"They make slow cooker liners. Basically plastic bags that you can cook in, then you just take it out and throw it away. No cleaning unless you somehow poke a hole in it."
gifs,fg5j5y6,t1_fg4517l,1580528908.0,Russian pararuelette.
functionalprint,fg509kd,t1_fg4y71m,1580515147.0,"Good point, depends on placement and the form that's threaded. Won't be an issue if the ""nut"" is the same material as the pot."
functionalprint,fg4uw7z,t1_fg4o8vd,1580511630.0,Indeed. General rule of thumb is 20% shrinkage from wet to kiln dry. So theoretically you take a standard thread size blow it up 20% and it should fit.
functionalprint,fg4j2d1,t3_ewr4oz,1580504274.0,"How does the thread hold up to shrinkage in the kiln? Is the thread sized to accept a standard thread, say to be able to use a standard bolt for mounting or assembly?"
funny,fg46eze,t1_fg3qw80,1580497119.0,"Yeah it would be great for short trips. Milwaukee to Chicago is a 30-40 minute flight. A lot of flight out of MKE connect to a longer flight out of O'Hare so you have to board and fly for a laughably short time just to do it all again for an 8 hour flight to Mexico. I would totally stand for that flight.  
  
If the plane is going down or skids off the runway and people are hurt, that's their problem. I'll sign a waiver."
