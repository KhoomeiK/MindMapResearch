HunterXHunter,ff41ki2,t1_ff3zwhi,1579553541.0,">I never told anybody not to do it. I'm not saying it isn't allowed or it isn't interesting to compare different characters to each other. I'm saying comparing them to each other doesn't actually determine anything.
>

It actually does determine everything. Newtons laws apply here, so everything can be observed and compared. Energy, physics, chemistry, etc., it all translates.

>But physically speaking, a 12-year-old Killua who doesn't have a lot of muscle shouldn't be able to open the gates that weigh multiple tons, before even learning nen. Yet he did that when he went to his house in the Zoldyck family arc. And physically speaking, Gon, who was 11 or 12 at that time, shouldn't able to push his opponents in Heaven's Arena 20-30 away from himself. Yet he did. All of his opponents were much bigger than him, too. Do these kind of physics apply to every series?
>

Muscle density and compound muscle are known factors in reality. Bruce Lee should not have been able to physically do some of the things did, but once doctors sat down and took a look at him, they understood why. Killua's feats are certainly implausible, but in the future if we learn how to layer muscle without taking up much space in the body, feats like this are certainly possible.

>And only Hunter x Hunter universe has nen. If you put a character from Hunter x Hunter into a different universe, they aren't going to be able to use nen there, since that universe doesn't have it. The same applies to every other character from every other series.
>

Who said nen doesn't exist in other universes? Its just energy that exists in a form that one world has learned to cultivate in their own unique way. Its all translatable.


>I don't have much to say about that specific comparison you're talking about, since i haven't watched or read the series which ""Deku"" character is from.

Deku is from My Hero Academia, and also a main subject of this post."
HunterXHunter,ff40y8v,t1_ff3ytb0,1579553157.0,"Because energy and physics translates across universes, thats how."
HunterXHunter,ff40wcl,t1_ff3yk7v,1579553125.0,Irrelevant. Science is still universal throughout both universes.
HunterXHunter,ff40til,t1_ff3x9rd,1579553075.0,"Nen is just a power, don't overthink it. If can be altered, overpowered, nullified and just like any other element, it's bound by the laws of science. If nen consists of energy and fields that are measurable, then it is almost certain that any form of energy that overwhelms or presses it would e effective. In HxH they use modern weaponry because it has been effective against nen users in the past. Therefore, its safe to say that abilities that come from MHA can definitely affect anyone or anything from HxH, unless the writers have re-written every scientific law that exists for that specific universe."
HunterXHunter,ff40ekq,t1_ff3y2l9,1579552813.0,"Yes. Research Newton's laws of physics. Most powers just enhance something that technically exist already, no matter how miniscule or vague, but to really break physics one would have to do something outside the reality of predictable science. Commiting an action that causes a reaction, for instance, is not breaking physics. Even something as wild as a kenisis or psychic ability is within the realms of our understanding, its just not possible with who and what we are, now.

You're making shit up, Nen is just as adaptive as anyone's power and the grasp they have over it...not ""building up nen spots"", get outta here.

I already mentioned Netero could, so could Merum, possibly even top tier fighters in HxH, but science tells us from simple observation, Deku's abilities are still dominant to just about anything in HxH universe. Killua's speed is another contender, but he couldn't hope to entirely get through One for All's protective aura before Killua's lightning god armor ran out. Deku is also scary resilient, so...just another thing to consider.

Nen is just another type of superpower that happens to be universally shared among those who have it, don't read into it too much."
HunterXHunter,ff3y4wq,t1_ff3wk3i,1579551399.0,"Anime isn't really the place to find the best writing, in my opinion. The Japanese are too metaphysical when it comes to a majority of their writing. Everything has to have an obscure reason that hides behind another reason, but its really connected back to three or four more obscure elements...and it's freegin all over the place. HxH does this a lot, trying to tie the plot to a hundred different loopholes and claiming its ""story"".

I recognize that MHA isn't the best written show, but at least they're straight forward about wtf it is they're attempting to accomplish. It's Heros vs Villains, thats it! Nothing below the surface, nothing complicated and to be honest, it's a breath of fresh air in the anime world."

HunterXHunter,ff3uwkc,t1_ff3rrvn,1579549381.0,"If people want to do it, then they can, its hurting nobody. If this sub wants to be anal about it, then they should create and enforce a rule. Finally, physics exists and is generally enough to determine comparing one universe to the next, so saying the phrase ""rules of the universe"", now, THAT is pointless, because it has nothing to do with comparisons. There are entire franchises that base their themes around comparisons between different realms, and unless the artist that created the realm also rewrote the laws of physics or other scientific reality, then it's perfectly reasonable to do so.

Comparisons of these different realms are actually really close to one another, in terms of physics and powers...but let's face it, HxH is old, now, and other animes are building themselves up faster than HxH ever did. Deku's powers are evolving in power so much faster than any character in the HxH universe, he would absolutely destroy Gon and Killua right now. Killua's speed could be a serious issue, but only for a bit. See? Both characters can be easily compared.
