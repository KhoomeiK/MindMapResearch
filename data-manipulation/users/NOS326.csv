Advice,fflu7mw,t1_fflfw4c,1580044261.0,"He just won’t take the weight thing seriously. It’s a touchy thing to bring up, but he’s in some kind of weird denial. Sometimes he makes jokes about it and sometimes he doesn’t understand why the vast majority of his wardrobe is out of commission. 

He’ll make jokes and jiggle himself and I have never ONCE laughed at them. We get to the gym less than we’d like, but it’s more so a food issue. He self reports eating bad when I’m not there. If I go out after work, he gets McDonalds and if a friend orders Whits Castle when he goes out, he’ll eat it even though he just ate a full dinner I cooked him. God only knows what he eats at work for lunch.

Like I don’t need him to have a six pack, but I hate how he just doesn’t even seem to care besides making like one comment a month about needing to lose weight. I hold my body to a higher standard and freak if my jeans start getting a little snug. Idk maybe this weight thing deserves it own post...."

What I do not love is waking up 15 minutes earlier than I need to, to fumble around my makeup bag, mustering up the coordination to apply my makeup Monday-Friday. *That* gets old.

askwomenadvice,ff9v2yw,t1_ff9p38a,1579722109.0,"Genuinely not trying to be combative, just annoyed by the notion that wearing makeup or not definitely determines someone's looking tired or not IRL and in this thread. I feel like the idea that natural = tired is pretty sad."
askwomenadvice,ff9mie2,t1_ff9kxzt,1579716105.0,"But do you really believe that people inherently look tired sans makeup or that you were socialized to believe that? When makeup wasn't the norm, did everyone just look tired? Do most men (since makeup isn't too common for them) look tired? Or do women who don't wear makeup look tired standing next to women who do wear makeup look tired in comparison? 

This is why I wanted to start wearing less and eventually little to no makeup. I avoided mirrors after I washed my face because I was constantly comparing myself with makeup to myself without makeup. I wanted to like myself and the way I looked all the time (in the morning, at the gym, after a shower, on a fancy date night). 

Trust me when I am sick, people know. I tend to sneeze in multiples, have coughing fits, and a stuffy voice. When I am tired, I act like I am tired. I mentioned it in another reply, but when I have actually been sick/tired (and it was very apparent despite makeup), not a word from anyone. It makes their ""concerned"" comments/questions seem suspicious."

askwomenadvice,ff9ku1g,t1_ff9h499,1579715120.0,"It's just annoying because there have been many times I actually have been visibly sick and not gotten a single comment about it. There's more to being sick than just not looking your best. You have a horse sound, talk nasally because of congestion, actually act tired, sneezing, coughing, etc. 

I'm not good enough at makeup to cover up how bad I've looked when I actually was sick. I don't use foundation or concealer or anything like that. When I am sick and wear makeup, I still feel like I look sick and have a bunch of other outward factors/symptoms to confirm it.

Maybe I should have added this detail, but I forgot. This is why I am less inclined to believe this newfound ""concern"" my coworkers have for me."

I feel like I am always playing ""catch up"" to slowly earn the things that were so freely given to my friends. I need to work hard at jobs I hate to earn money that they were handed to get a degree.
