Side B - You hit someone with your car (Hopefully only Meredith, thank god)
Up B - Michael steps on a grill and the pain shoots him in upwards ark (does 1% damage to yourself)

Quentin dying had more of an impact on Earth 2 laurel I’d say. And I feel like she’s the main reason they didn’t bring back earth 1 laurel, but you could say if they brought her back then earth 2 laurel never joins the team or anything.
