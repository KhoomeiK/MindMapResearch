ChoosingBeggars,fde0uqm,t3_ekss6w,1578328638.0,Must feel great to know that your act of generosity REALLY helped your neighbor’s kid. These things can be make-or-break when you come from a poor background. What about the cousin? Is he still a twat?
WeightLossAdvice,fcse470,t3_eimi0y,1577915247.0,"You’re going so well... 40+ lbs is incredible. I totally understand the withdrawal from sugar and salty junk. The first few weeks cutting it out are just hell (been there... a couple of times unfortunately). And it takes time to appreciate the taste of real food again and stop craving the junk. Keep it going, and keep posting. Knowing that there are people out there who are getting healthy is inspiring :)"
aww,fcr1j2j,t3_eii4yv,1577895410.0,The absolute definition of awwww!!!
WeightLossAdvice,fcqnn34,t3_ei6e17,1577889163.0,The first week or two is/was hellish for me (this is unfortunately not my first weight loss rodeo). Hungry all the time... but I know that it’s the habit of constantly eating I have to break and it’s not real hunger. I’m just so used to snacking and eating until stuffed. I remember reading somewhere it takes several weeks to change a habit... I think you have to try to make it through these weeks to start to de-program yourself.
