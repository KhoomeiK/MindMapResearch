Life is dangerous, and anyone who says otherwise is full of shit.  People also need to be able to get from one place to another, whether by driving or by other means.  The sheer fact that more people are participating in an activity like driving should skew the numbers much higher, but that's not the reality.  Despite the fact that an astronomically larger percentage of the population deals with a car on a daily basis, the number of deaths are on par with each other, and the US has a larger figure for gun deaths than the next 25 developed countries on the list;last time I checked we aren't the only country with cars

nextfuckinglevel,femk7ds,t1_fem004m,1579259738.0,"It's essentially the same thing you see when you spin a coin, which is just a disk, on a desk; The disk in this case is optimally designed to conserve as much angular momentum as possible (the part of physics that keeps it spinning).  The mirrored base provides a smooth, low friction surface, and is slightly concave to keep the toy centered.

If you spin a coin, you're imparting energy to it, which makes it both spin on its axis and roll slightly on its edge.  After a short time the spinning action will translate mostly into rolling, and it will roll around on the edge until it falls over.  This is due to the fact that the coin is too heavy for the rolling action to overcome the effect of gravity.

Euler's disk is designed so that most of the spinning energy can be directly transferred to rolling energy, and is balanced so that the action of rolling is just enough to mostly counteract the force of gravity while the disk is rolling.  It's theoretically possible, given the removal of friction and air resistance, for a Euler's disk to spin basically forever"
