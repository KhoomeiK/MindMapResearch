SuicideWatch,ff8pljq,t1_ff8p7by,1579690579.0,"The words you just said to me have had the most impact of anything I’ve ever read through a screen. Thank you so so much. People like you make this life feel worth living sometimes, I’m none of your business, yet you still care for some reason. I’m the same way with people and it’s encouraging to see someone else with a similar mindset. The “trap house” I live in can be crazy and overwhelming, but they’ve done nothing but support me both physically and mentally. I have a stronger family connection with them than I ever had with my own family, but I appreciate your concern. Thank you so much, I appreciate this more than you could imagine."
SuicideWatch,ff8jh3q,t1_ff863v1,1579681352.0,Hatred is hard to force. Trust me. I can’t hate my dad despite him being the reason I’m diagnosed with PTSD.
SuicideWatch,ff8jcmf,t3_es8nt7,1579681175.0,"I find it so hard to wake up in the morning. I lack all motivation and my life consists of constant trips to hospitals and therapy. I stopped doing all heavy substances nearly a month ago but art and other mediums have not been enough to help me cope. I live in shame as a failure to my parents for having these mental health issues, which for the most part were caused by them. I’ve been constantly fucked over and abandoned by people who have previously said they loved me and I see no end in sight. Every day I feel more alone, despite living with 12 people. I feel too empty to keep fighting."

DMT,felmyx9,t1_felmeuh,1579226041.0,"When I was younger, their appearances in my dreams were always associated with fear. I’d see them in a window and be paralyzed and unable to scream. But when I trip they just seem to stare at me, but I don’t feel threatened."
DMT,felm3or,t1_fellxoa,1579225443.0,"Even when I was young I’d often have dreams with demonic figures such as these, and I’ve noticed they tend to appear during my trips as well."
NewSkaters,fejdxbm,t1_fejc9jp,1579169318.0,"Kick flips are still very hard for me. I can boardslide, and sometimes even fakie tre flip, but they’re still a challenge for me."
