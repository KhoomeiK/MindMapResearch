wowthanksimcured,ffdghfu,t3_et07li,1579820366.0,"Ok so I've been reading more about autism recently. I've been thinking for a while now that maybe I have autism but was never diagnosed because when I was young they thought basically only boys could have it.

For people with autism, it's hard for them to express their feelings, and that's nothing to do with give and take in friendships. It's hard for them to make lots of friends, but that doesn't mean they're bad friends. Maybe the reason someone wants therapy is because they are having trouble making friends. Maybe they have trauma that they need professional help with. Maybe they just like it.

Whether or not someone needs therapy because they don't have many friends, because they want someone impartial and professional to talk to, because they just want a proper therapist who knows what they're talking about, it's none of Twitter OP's business. If getting therapy helps someone and makes them a better person that's good. Twitter OP is exactly the kind of stigma-prolonging dick that no one needs.

worldnews,ff92jjy,t1_ff8w9cf,1579703263.0,"I hate buying toiletries and cleaning products for this. With some things like food and drink you can kind of change what or where you buy to reduce packaging waste, like buying refill packs of coffee, shopping at local shops where you can take your own bags and tubs. 

But where I live it's basically impossible to do that with household things. Some supermarkets nationally have brought in refill machines for certain brands of laundry detergent and cleaning fluid, but we don't have that option here. I've long hated, for example, buying plastic bottles of shampoo and shower gel, and if they introduced a better reuse system for those bottles I'd be much happier about it. 

Some brands have too much illusion of choice like basically the same formula will be sold as cleaning different things, so have different bottles. Often hot soapy water or vinegar is the best cleaner anyway, so that's an easy way to reduce, not buying unnecessary cleaning sprays. Another thing they could do is for the supermarket own brand toiletries, just have like one or two fragrances for each and dispense like a drinks machine into refill bottles. You don't need a million flavours of shampoo. My skin is too sensitive to use harshly coloured or fragranced products so I doubly don't get the overwhelming choice. It's just to sell more stuff, it's to make everyone consume mindlessly. It's bad for the planet, and totally unnecessary."

Not as people who either have more to worry about than packaging, or who do care and want companies to be better, but don't think they can influence that. Basically the company thinks plastic is the most cost effective material and don't care enough about the environmental impact to do something about it, but want to be able to blame their customers for that.

I think this video about companies choosing to use the word consumer more and more, is worth a watch:

https://youtu.be/Ta7kIZTYBt0

Also of note, in east Africa, fizzy drink companies use glass bottles, customers return the bottles after drinking, and the factory collects them from retailers, cleans and refills them. But in the West we can't have that option with many bottled products from drinks to toiletries, why? It should not be easier and cheaper to create so much waste.

I watched this horrible documentary about pedigree dogs where they interviewed kennel club members who tried to wave away the fact they force their dogs to inbreed even though they know why it would be wrong for humans to, for instance, mate parent to child or grandparent to grandchild.
