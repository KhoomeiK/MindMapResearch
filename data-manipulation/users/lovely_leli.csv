aww,fgyi257,t1_fgygj4v,1581183570.0,"Ha, I hadn't even noticed the downvotes but I appreciate the solidarity! I'm literally studying wildlife biology right now. I genuinely get why she's doing it and that it's sweet for her, and I'm absolutely not condemning her for it... But I'm with you. All of my animals have hunted something and I'll let them lick my hands or whatever, maybe even my cheek sometimes, but it's a myth that your dog's mouth is cleaner than yours. They have all kinds of bacteria in their saliva that doesn't mesh well with human bacteria, which is why bites can get so badly infected. I'm not gonna put myself in that position. *shrug

Edit: grammatical mistake"
Ghosts,fgyfl5k,t3_f0tfz9,1581182872.0,"To me, it looks like a spider building a web. It's obviously something really close to the lens because it never makes it farther back into the room, and spiders can move back and forth across their webs pretty fast like that."
aww,fgye5kl,t3_f0q972,1581182395.0,"That mouth has had dead animals in it and she's letting it lick her face. Gross.

In all seriousness, don't come at me, I get it, it's a social thing for wolves to lick mouths, I've been studying wildlife the past few years, ""it's natural!!"", it's a sweet video, blah blah blah... It's still unpleasant to think about haha"

Become friends with my husband to help him with his grief losing me without warning. 

Meet my brothers gaming and see what they really thought (think?) of me, ha."

raisedbynarcissists,fg7yh5l,t1_fg7ya31,1580604726.0,"So my mom I could avoid telling because we don't talk, but she would inevitably find out and would call me on it and I wouldn't entirely know how to respond.
My husband's stepdad is the main problem because we want his mom there but don't think it's appropriate if he is there. And she has her own codependency issues I guess."
AskReddit,fg4f8dp,t3_ewmszg,1580502313.0,Dishonored. Was trying to get the no kill achievement and had been doing well up until the next to last chapter. At the beginning of the chapter I knocked someone out with a dart and they fell in the water. I didn't realize that would count against me as a kill so I painstakingly went through the rest of it without killing anyone... Got to the end of the chapter and it said I'd killed someone and I was so mad at myself that I quit and didn't pick it up again. That was in 2015. Maybe I'll try again this year..
raisedbynarcissists,ffytmog,t1_ffyqkrd,1580354834.0,"That is totally fair and a valid point. I like to point it out if the conversation comes up because I had a friend that dealt with it and it was horrible. You're right though, it is rare, just something to know if you've never dealt with tampons before. As you said, the numbers are down in part to women being aware of the risk, so I wanted to help her know it existed in case she didn't :)"

I will say, since you're new to using them, make sure you change them regularly, which should be easy for you since your flow is heavy like that. Toxic shock syndrome is real and it's terrifying. Good luck to you, my friend!"

I was going down on him on the couch, we were having a good time. Common courtesy, if anyone reading this doesn't know, is if someone is sucking your dick you should warn the person when you're getting close, but he I guess decided not to? So when he came, I was not expecting it. I felt like I got shot, it came out so fast and straight to the back of my throat so as a reflex.. I spit it back at him. But somehow it wasn't a straight line of it, I like.. sprayed it all over his stomach and the couch. We just looked at each other in silence for a second and then both cracked up laughing. He warned me before he came from then on."

It's the original saying of what ended up becoming ""blood is thicker than water"". Lots of sayings like that change their meanings over time and I went on a research spree looking at all the originals to modern ones. It was an interesting few days, but this one was my favorite, followed by ""Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back"""
