8 years (in total) later and I finally feel like I've made it.

1. Got a DUI with my friend.
2. Resigned in a fit of rage.
3. Bosses daughter in law got me evicted after I resigned (she knew the homeowner and was probably fucking him).
4. Shitty banker job, no license, nothing to my name.
5. Start a business (the reason I resigned).
6. Work 3AM-9PM every day for 18 months.
7. Bring on friend as business partner.
8. Spend 18 months trying to get friend to do his fucking job while I'm literally killing myself with no sleep and using my part time job to pay business expenses.
9. Dissolve partnership according to partnership agreement... Spend 18 more months with fuck face and his friends actively trying to ruin the business through reviews and comments on social media.
10. Have bank account levied because he broke the partnership agreement and sued me and the company. Lawyer bills stacking up and business starts declining to the point it's almost bankrupt.
11. ... Finally win court case because he failed to have us served properly, also our contract protect both parties from being sued without first attempting mediation.

Drinking had become a real problem. The depression is at an all time high. Everything I spent 10 years working toward is on the verge of collapse. I hated my GF because she refused to have any sexual contact (I wonder why....) 

In the midst of all the shit I learned how to keep moving forward.

Business partner is gone. Revenue doubled last year and saved everything. Hit $20k in sales in November, and heading into the busiest quarter of the year, we're looking like $20k won't be a fluke high sales month, but our average monthly auto debits.

My GF and I are closer than ever because we fought our way through the shit together and fighting to make things work through all the hardships has made arguing/fighting almost non-existent. We just know each other so much better now.

The drinking and depression are under control, and it's even led to helping Purge the shit people from my life.

Oh... And business partner is back to being a bus boy 5 days a week. All because he thought I'd work and he'd get paid for my work.
