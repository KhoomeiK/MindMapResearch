Well yes, I think most people would agree. If you have someone taking photos of an important moment on their cell phone and they come out really poorly to the point that they're basically unusable, then you'd consider getting new photos done. And the new, usable photos would be more important than the original, unusable ones, because they're actually usable. To be clear, that doesn't make any of this more important than the actual engagement, which is what OP seems to be misinterpreting.

I can tell you from experience, taking photos on a cell phone camera with such contrasting skin tones is already a pain. Doing it in the dark at night time is even worse. The sort of photos OP is describing are pretty awful in my experience. Using an actual camera would have drastically improved the result.

This is OP's interpretation:

There's a distinction. OP obviously feels like that's all she cares about, but if you read the two sentences describing the actual conversation it doesn't sound like that at all. If anything there's simply a disconnect in communication. It sounds like she's ecstatic to be engaged, and would just like to have some nicer photos. If you look at OP's comments this becomes even clearer:

>She said she'd be okay re-staging but I rejected that immediately because I thought acting it all out again would be insane. Then she said it could also be a simple second surprise one during a walk around the block or something.

She wants some nicer photos, but the fact that she'd be fine with a stroll around the block tells me she doesn't view this as anywhere near as big a deal as OP does. OP is the one being touchy about this and rejecting things out of hand, not his fiance. Staged photos are a common way to capture moments like this if there was some reason why the original event couldn't be photographed or recorded. It's not a weird, insane or offensive request like OP is making it out to be. Hell, half the photos from most weddings are staged. Why is this different?"

Yes, husband was an asshole for the way he treated this woman and his child, but that doesn't mean OP now gets to unilaterally make major familial and financial decisions with zero input from her husband. That level of poor communication is a sure fire way to hurt your relationship.

It sounds like the big fear for you is picturing yourself and your fiance in front of your family and friends at the ceremony and he's got the whole gang while you've just got your sister.

Give the rest of the groomsmen seats toward the front with your immediate families.
