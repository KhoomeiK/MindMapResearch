bipolar,ffbyw88,t1_ffbvfuz,1579787125.0,"What the fuck do you think I do when I'm manic/depressed bro?

I'm not shooting cocaine into my penis in a dirty hotel room when I'm manic. I go and try to start up new businesses to take care of my family (same size as yours btw.)

When I'm depressed I might be more snappy and have less energy, but I still take care of my family. 

Some days I have too much energy and too many thoughts. Others it's hard to find the motivation to get out of bed. A good support system, healthy food, good sleep, exercise, and marijuana is all I need. Forgot to mention that's my med of choice earlier.

Yes it sucks not being in control of my emotions but my struggle is mostly internal not external. I'm not some sort of off the handle wacko monster like you seem to think.

Idk man it seems like you're making assumptions about what others go through. I'm very sorry you can't function without your meds and I'm happy they work for you, but not everyone wants or needs medicating."
bipolar,ffbv69z,t1_ffbpzd1,1579783844.0,"Um no?


Not everyone needs meds. I'm also not a fan of psych wards, weird huh?

Everyone here wants to be like ""Oh my God thanks to getting involuntarily admitted for a month and 13 pills a day I can still be miserable but not crazy!""

Fuck that.

I hated meds. I tried tons... Too many.. when they run out I'm miserable. When they work I'm ""okay"" at best.

Since I stopped my meds two years ago it's been rough but I've been much better than when I had them. I manage my moods and ride out the lows and highs and practice mental strength.

Sorry it seems unbelievable to you and evidently like three other people that I can function without meds."
bipolar,ffap9z7,t3_eskhrj,1579741295.0,"I said fuck the meds and I'm stronger mentally for it.

I gotta say, your outlook on gift giving and receiving speaks to the lifestyle you live and how you view the world. In my world, any gift is seen as awesome because we don't have all that much. I would kill for a stand mixer cause I don't own one.

I was hit by a car in May or 2018 out of nowhere. I never thought it could happen to me and I used to ride with no helmet all the time. Hell, I even totaled a motorcycle with no helmet and made it just fine once, it can happen.

 The Imgur link is a screenshot of my injuries from my hospital patient portal. The only reason I didn't die on the cold, wet pavement in 2018 is because of my helmet. 

The helmet had gouges going several MM deep into the plastic shell. There were deep scratches on literally every side of the helmet, so if I didn't have it, every part of my face would have come into contact with hard shit. My head would have been a watermelon. Plus to not wearing a helmet is a relatively quick death, because your head will fucking explode if you're unlucky.

weed,fc34ivs,t1_fc2so5d,1577381239.0,"So far your essentials are:

1. Small pipe. Doesn't gotta be a one hitter. Look around and get a cute one you like. They have all kinds in headshops. It should have a hole in the side and a small bowl about the size of your finger. The hole inside the bowl should be small. Idk how to describe this but smaller than the diameter of a pencil eraser is good. 

You're gonna be grinding this stuff kinda fine, but if it isn't super dry, you'll be alright without a filter. I prefer glass, because it doesn't get clogged and you weren't smoking metal. 

I need to warn you about something that I affectionately call ""Scooby snacks."" A Scooby snack is a small piece of weed, usually on fire or just burnt, that you just sucked through the opening and into your smoke-filled mouth and throat. 

In my experience, you will I instantly cough out your hit and almost vomit from choking on this tiny-ass piece of weed. Or it just goes on your tongue. 

It sucks but here's how you avoid it 99 percent of the time. Pack your bowl then push your finger down on the bud. Gently blow into the mouth hole and any pieces will shoot from the carb hole on the side. You can repeat this step, after every hit if it suits you. This works for me and is preferable to the screens.

2. Haggle with the headshop.They have a huge margin on most of this. Last time I saw a nice glow in the dark pipe that was on a rack that said ""Buy one get one free"" and it was $30. I asked if he could give me just that one cause all I had was $20. He said yes and it's my main one now.

3. Bic lighter

4. Grinder. Get one that fits well in your hand. Ask to see several, open them, get a feel for how you would actually grind something with it. I have one that I thought felt too small but I got a good deal on it. Turns out grinding with it actually hurts my hand but I don't wanna buy another right now. It's uncomfortable but avoidable if you get the right one thr first time.

Again, haggle here. Let the guy behind the counter know that you need a small pipe and a decent grinder. Let them know your budget if you feel like it would help them narrow it down for you. 

It might seem like a lot, but if you go in expecting to spend $100 here, you will probably walk out with a nice palm sized grinder with a pollen catcher and sharp blades, that looks dope af to you and feels nice to use as well as a pipe that you like, functionally and visually.

A nice grinder is a beautiful, easy thing to use. A shitty grinder will frustrate you and not save your kief. Another thing I noticed is my palm sized grinder got more kief than the little one I got.



Grind some bud up, take a pinch and put it in your pipe. Push it down and do the Scooby snack thing. When you're ready, cover the side hole, light your flame, and lower it to the bowl without burning your fucking face off (it's easy don't worry)

Gently suck the smoke in. Newbie pro tip: mouth full of smoke, then take a deep breath. That will get you a little bit of smoke at a time and not choke you out.

You will get a feel for your style of packing and smoking. Take a few hits

Hope this made sense lmao. I started replying at the beginning of a king-sized cone and finished it at the end.

Amanita is shit. It's just straight shit. If you can get enough in you to get high, it won't do what psilocybin does. It can kill you too. 

If there's any sort of conspiracy regarding mushrooms it's gonna involve actual psychoactive ones such as psilocybe cubensis, cyanescens, azurescens, etc.

Don't mean to burst your bubble or anything but you should really take in what I'm telling you. At the very least to sound more educated because when I read amanita in your post it screamed that you know nothing about mushrooms (idk if that's true about you personally)"
