(On the other hand my own brother was a picky eater without any ""deeper"" issues, and because he had his way he developed a very unhealthy diet in his teen years and became overweight, that's why i don't want to give in too easy either.)

relationships,fdbgzd2,t1_fdaz483,1578257289.0,"I never thought that i would ever have that problem, but my 4 year old has turned slowly into a very picky eater.
We eat rather healthy and cook daily.
He ate almost everything when he was younger and then it became less and less. 
For example: He loves noodles but not the sauce (almost any sauce) 
When he ist allowed to he will eat a plate full of plain noodles, period.
When the sauce ist mixed with the pasta and we force him to at least try it there will be a long tantrum and in the end he eats 3 noodles crying, it never changes for the better. Its exhausting.
