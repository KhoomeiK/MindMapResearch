The episode after Curtis dies, they have the discussion about whether or not you should save a sibling or 5 strangers from a book of tough questions. They all choose a sibling, which I think would be a lot of peopleâ€™s gut reaction, but then they go through this whole â€˜do I save my sister or save the world from the four horsemenâ€™ dilemma. And Iâ€™m over here like â€œDIDNâ€™T YOU GUYS JUST DO THIS 9 EPISODES AGO WHEN PIPER WAS SICK?! And you decided that you should save the 6 innocent sick people rather than have your sister?!â€ It drives me crazy. Like you literally just had this conversation a couple of months ago."
charmed,fervzfk,t1_feq54za,1579358945.0,"See this is what I mean about not being consistent. Iâ€™ll look past the Chris thing with no problem, but I watched the Awakening where Piper gets Oroya Fever, and the timing is off while sheâ€™s in the hospital and it pisses me off. I watched this episode yesterday and immediately came here to rant about it. My rant, which I didnâ€™t post because itâ€™s a stupid little thing that turned me into a maniac, was over 1000 words long which is just ridiculous for literally 2 minutes worth of timing/dialogue issues. 

I make no sense. Ugh brain why?"
charmed,feppjy6,t1_fepfm2x,1579327044.0,"Okay, so I just rewatched both Dr. Curtis episodes to remind myself of all the details. I also did a 5-minute google search on Oroya Fever (so I'm pretty much now the world's leading expert lol  /s) 

He's a specialist who works with infectious diseases. Piper was infected with an antibiotic-resistant strain of Oroya Fever and went from infection to symptoms to comma within a 48-hour period which is way too fast, usually the incubation period is about 20 days. This could be a mistake, or this could be semi-intentional to show that she has a particularly aggressive strain of the disease. If I had to guess I would say it's both. Anyway, Piper goes into a coma, which basically unless a miracle happens, is almost certain death. Piper wakes up when she should have died due to the spell, which confuses Dr. Curtis. 

Then within less than 24 hours after Piper wakes, six people in his hospital have become infected by a disease that is only transferrable through the sharing of blood, i.e. a bit from a sand fly or being jabbed with a contaminated needle. Because there are no sand flies and would have been no needle contamination if it weren't for magic, that means that he has to assume that this is an extremely rare and evolved version of this disease. By studying the blood and trying to find what caused Piper to recover miraculously, he is attempting to find a permanent cure to this disease, perhaps even a vaccine, which is something that pretty much any doctor worth his salt would do. 

Now he did take it to an extreme by doing things like, not sleeping, obsessing solely on this case, and immediately beginning animal testing (I don't know if he got CDC or FDA approval for either by the way. And usually people start by testing on mice to the best of my knowledge, not chimps right away, but whatever.) He injected the Halliwell blood into the chimps and then the chimps used their powers to inject more Halliwell blood into him. This is the catalyst that takes him from obsessive to harmful and physically violent. We also know that his sister is dying of kidney failure. I think if he has this cure to obsess over, he doesn't have to focus on the helplessness that is watching a sibling die. 

Anyway, I'm not trying to say that he wasn't mostly responsible for his own downfall because he definitely was, but he would have been fine if the charmed ones hadn't messed up with magic, which was the same argument I used for Darryl and Sheridan. 

TL:DR Curtis, Darryl, and Sheridan were all screwed because the charmed ones had magic, even if it wasn't directly the fault of the sisters."

Edit 2: Now to actually answer your question... I guess when Darryl ends up almost being executed or when Sheridan gets put into a coma in the psych ward to keep her from talking. They aren't completely the Halliwell's fault... but they were sloppy and therefore those two were punished to clean up their messes. Or maybe Dr. Curtis too.

greysanatomy,femgbxj,t3_epxf5v,1579254048.0,"My dislike of Owen has very little to do with his physically hurting Cristina. He obviously didnâ€™t mean to and he was genuinely horrified afterwards. I donâ€™t think he fully realized how bad his PTSD was affecting him until this moment happened and I still donâ€™t think heâ€™s aware of how seriously itâ€™s continuing to affect his mental health.

I donâ€™t think that Owen has sought the proper help for his PTSD and I think that a lot of disagreements that people in the show have with him feel like a personal attack to him and he becomes extremely defensive and controlling as a result. Especially when the person is in a romantic relationship with him. 

I donâ€™t believe that he means to be the way he is, but I donâ€™t think that he has a clear view of himself. I think if he went to therapy consistently, he would have a better sense of self-awareness and I would like him a lot more. 

This is going to sound a little off topic so hang with me here. Have you ever heard how itâ€™s very common for people who have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder to struggle with their disease? In a lot of cases, patients will be taking medication that makes them feel better, and once they do feel better, they will stop taking their medication. They do this because they have a sense of being cured, not really realizing that they have to take the medication continuously for the treatment to remain effective. I think Owen is a little bit like that. Heâ€™ll go to therapy for a little bit, do some of the work, make some kind of a break through, and then he feels cured, not realizing that in a lot of cases, especially PTSD, the only effective treatment is to be continuously working on it. He needs something to shock him into seeing his situation clearly. Remember when Cristina flinched away from him when he got mad while he was cooking dinner and he realized that he needed to go back to therapy? I think he needs another moment like that to see himself more clearly."

TIHI,fely5nt,t3_epv1cv,1579233923.0,"Foot binding is really horrible. There are some crappy things that people do for â€œbeautyâ€ but foot binding is so creepy imo. The skin is gross, but if you look at the X-rays too, they really fuck up their feet. And some of the shoes that show how tiny some feet are bound are just heartbreaking."
TIHI,fela8rl,t1_fel607t,1579217472.0,Actually yeah someone did 10 hours ago. There was a whole conversation about it.
TIHI,fel9tv0,t1_feklbis,1579217208.0,"Before we are born our upper skulls are actually just floating bone plates. I donâ€™t remember exactly how many 6 or 8 maybe, but they donâ€™t come together to form until we are pushed out of the birth canal. There are still usually gaps in the skull after a baby is born. If youâ€™ve ever seen a baby with a soft spot on their head, itâ€™s actually a gap in the skull. They finally fuse together somewhere between 9 and 18 months old. 

The jaw probably grows and fills up the gaps like that. Itâ€™s not that much different than breaking your arm and having the bone regrow.

Edit: I have no proof about this, but just thinking about it further, the growth of the jaw might actually be what forces the eruption of our adult teeth. They have to come out because there is no longer a place for the to stay. Idk if thatâ€™s true, but it makes sense to me at least."
TIHI,fel8x6l,t1_fejyall,1579216625.0,Yeah. I saw my brother x-ray of his teeth when he was about 4. Itâ€™s all shadowy and much fuzzier than this. Definitely not an X-ray

AmItheAsshole,fel4mkw,t1_fel3gi8,1579213953.0,"FWIW I love Berlin and Iâ€™m also not into the night scene. But thereâ€™s a lot of really interesting history there. I know itâ€™s not everyoneâ€™s cup of tea, but it wasnâ€™t mentioned in either your guysâ€™ likes or dislikes so I wanted to mention it. 

But I completely understand about both the money and the work. You put in the effort because you donâ€™t need or want anyone else to have to pay for you. And while he was trying to something nice, he made you feel like your opinion didnâ€™t matter. NTA"

HydroHomies,fel23gb,t3_epqbg2,1579212389.0,But what if you like the drama? I love listening to other peopleâ€™s drama. I like to know everything. I donâ€™t do anything with it but Iâ€™m nosy AF. But this is why my friends accompany me to the bathroom so they can share while I pee.
AmItheAsshole,fel1r6u,t3_epqcbk,1579212180.0,"NAH. You were upfront about it with your brother and if heâ€™s fine with it, you are good. Your mom can be miffed, but itâ€™s your brotherâ€™s day, not hers."
AmItheAsshole,fel1ng0,t1_fel1l9f,1579212116.0,15 years it sounds like.
AmItheAsshole,fel14sy,t3_epp6y2,1579211808.0,"Iâ€™m a little torn here. I completely understand why she would tell her mother first then you, especially given the fact that you arenâ€™t living together. I think 2 weeks is a little excessive. If I was in your shoes, I would be a little upset about how long she waited, but I would be more upset that sheâ€™s already made plans (Mom will take the baby) before you were even informed. 

People can talk all they want about hypotheticals but until it actually happens, you never know. Some people have a change of heart because now it seems real. Others stay with what they previously wanted. Itâ€™s not always an easy thing. What if you had changed your mind and she was just going to give the child to her mom? There was no discussion. It is ultimately her choice, but she didnâ€™t give you the chance to give your thoughts before she decided. There is just a lack of curtesy there that would upset me. 

She is completely within her rights to decide what she wants to do as far as abortion to keep the baby. You are also within your right to not want the child. 

It sounds to me like you have your opinion but you arenâ€™t trying to force it on her. Youâ€™ve accepted her decision and will give financial support regardless of whether or not you are together. 

I guess Iâ€™m going to go with NAH, but I can see where both sides made mistakes."
