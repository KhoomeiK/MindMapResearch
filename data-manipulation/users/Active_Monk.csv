If you can't do that, then there's no point deluding yourself that you have an ""FTP"" - more to the point, if you think it takes ""years"" to nail a 20 minute effort sit on your hands and stop giving advice because you're clueless.

And, no, for reasons given a ramp test is a complete waste of time for a beginner. It doesn't even measure your fucking FTP.

As I say, if you can't ride for 20 minutes then you don't really have an FTP and there's not much point telling someone it's 200w.

Not the least, if there's any point to ""keeping someone in check"" why would you give them a ramp test? Picture, for example, someone who hasn't exercised for years, decides to start cycling. Sees Geraint Thomas pretending he likes zwift in an advert and buys some stuff.

Do you really think he should do the 'ride as hard as you can until you collapse"" ramp test at this point? The guy gets out of breath walking from his car to the office.

If you had a friend who wanted to start running would you just take them out for a slow run or put them on a treadmill and say ""Every 30 seconds I'm going to turn up the speed until you fly off"" ?"
cycling,ffqo9mc,t1_ffpnvka,1580139768.0,"I tend to disagree. If you can't ride for 20 minutes then I would suggest you're not even at the stage where you need to be doing intervals or training plans.

Most beginners (or anyone who has had a gap for a few weeks or longer since they last cycled) would be far better off just riding around in zwift, doing base miles and building some endurance fitness (albeit sitting on a trainer might not be the ideal place for this)

Ramp tests make sense for measuring VO2max in a lab environment. But I find the whole zwift idea of ""Welcome to zwift! Hey, do a ramp test now! Now try one our interval plans!"" to be completely opposite to how a beginner should start.

Of course, their marketing and (seemingly mistaken belief) of who is going to use their product is that everyone is Cameron Jaffers and wants to be Geraint Thomas (The irony being neither of them wants to use zwift, one connected his hamsters wheel to his trainer to unlock a bike and the other is just happy to take their money to appear in an advert) and then they went outside to cycle.

Someone fit like that though, whose done hundreds and thousands of miles outside, sure, jump on the trainer, do an FTP test, start some intervals.

But, it's not what beginners should do.

The irony here is, even the idea of an FTP test being 20 minutes is already because amateurs are supposedly too lazy or unfit to ride for around an hour until exhaustion.

Then they cut it down to 8 minute efforts. Now a ramp test?

But that said, the pace you did in a recent race is more apt than an old FTP test.

The question is, though, whether you can train at that increased level or not. Not everyone can. Similarly in the way that a lot of people can get a higher FTP indoors vs outdoors or vice-versa. 

The reason you're measuring your FTP is to set zones for training, and you both need to ensure that you can complete the training but also that it's putting enough stress on your body to trigger adaptations.

If it were me I'd go with the bigger figure, and knock it down if you struggle to maintain the FTP (or whatever intervals your training plan has) outside of a race context."

Besides (and jeez you really are a remedial group - please try and think before posting) the stated claim was that the number 1 problem was getting hit - i.e actually getting hit - not the mere fear of getting hit that you've picked up from cyclists fetishisng cycling accidents and deaths in social media.

You only have to look at how many redditors claim any posted bad thing that happens to someone is somehow ""their greatest fear"" no matter how remote or unlikely that thing is to happen at all, let alone to them. Just browse reddit sometime and see all that anxiety.

And that's all it is. Insecurity and anxiety. So it's not a surprise many cyclists, and even some people that don't cycle, have developed a completely disproportionate sense of how dangerous cycling is once you started highlighting every collision without any context (i.e there's no sense of the millions of journeys completed that have no issues, nor of the thousands of people who are rushed to hospitals for other reasons - reasons often linked to a sedentary lifestyle)

At one time the UK mainstream media were doing this which no doubt discouraged many people from cycling at a time when adoption was on the rise. Now the mainstream media seem to have moved onto knives as though people being stabbed is new or as if your chances of getting across London on foot without being stabbed are about 1 in 5 or something.

A bit disingenuous no? Remember you just said you had an old 1970s fixie. i.e you're not trusting your bike lock for a few minutes on a £400 hybrid are you?

I mean, my argument isn't just that $3000 bikes can't be ridden into town. I wouldn't take my hybrid and that cost £400 in 2012 because I'm reasonably sure someone would steal or damage it if I did.

And the point there really isn't about the cost of the bike to me. If my hybrid gets stolen, in whole or part, well, I might as well have walked and how many times would I replace it before I thought ""Fuck this..."" you know?

The irony here I think is the people crying about being hit, well, statistically that's a pretty rare event. Yet we have people passing the onion as though it's mere luck that any of us are alive. So, no, sorry, I don't think cyclists that fetishise cyclist deaths are discussing an important topic because they have no sense of proportion or the true risk - quite often because they fetishise every death.

If you fetishised every heart attack in the same way cyclists do, the front page would be full, hundreds every day. Cycling deaths isn't even a blip.

Cyclists live longer than the general population.

You see, if you said to me ""Actually the number of bikes stolen is quite low statistically, look at these figures"" then maybe you could convince me I could use my bike for errands.

But, right now, I fully believe that even an inexpensive but well maintained and reasonably nice bike is not safe to leave parked pretty much regardless of whatever lock you use. I believe that I am orders of magnitude more likely to be a victim of theft if I chose to use my bike in this way than I would to be involved in a collision with a motor vehicle.

Maybe I'm wrong about the theft, I'm sure about the KSI because I've seen the statistics.

Because, you know, if I thought I was going to get hit by a car I wouldn't be riding a bike. I wouldn't go for walks either. I believe where I live, cycling and walking are both around the same risk in spite of (and here's the kicker) pedestrians already having their own special infrastructure. It's rare though that you find people fretting about the dangers of walking somewhere in the same way people talk about how dangerous they think cycling is."
cycling,ffg2gtu,t1_fffybh1,1579897022.0,"None of these things would affect how much cycling I do.

i.e I don't cycle now in certain circumstances where I'd have to leave the bike unattended but this additional mileage would not be done if you gave me a lock, better lights, mudguards or hypothetical infrastructure.

Because your infrastructure that supposedly secured a bike would either not work (like locks) or would cost far more than would make it worthwhile.

Whilst roads are far from perfect, the nature of my cycling means I get to pick the routes I ride and there's no shortage of available routes that I feel reasonably secure riding. Put simply if I wanted to ride 200 miles a day I could do that on the existing infrastructure in my country - and, more specifically, I'd pick the infrastructure I use now over so-called 'bike paths'

Given that I'm a long, long way from riding 200 miles a day, it's not infrastructure that affects how much I ride.

I didn't say or argue ""getting hit isn't an issue at all"" I questioned this notion that it's the biggest problem that cyclists have from any perspective (but particularly here where the context is engineering - at least for those paying attention)

cycling,fffvvxf,t1_ffft1fy,1579892943.0,"The point here was a few cunts tried to be dismissive to the OP suggesting the only issue with cycling was death. Yawn.

I mean come on. These guys have recognised issues that already have hundreds, if not thousands of products.

But, they are students so maybe identifying and solving a completely original problem is unlikely. You know if your kid said ""I want to do something for the science fair, how about something for your bike that would stop you getting wet?"" would you say ""No you useless cunt, solve climate change, getting wet is only a mild inconvenience""?

My point to them is that, for me, there's no point designing a better lock - because it won't work. Which is clearly something you accept because you don't ride a bike to the city you take a ""shitty 1970s schwinn fixie conversion"" more or less accepting the truth of the situation. i.e that you know locks are all shit and any nice bike you parked, even if not expensive, would likely get stolen or damaged.

So, at that point, why waste your time designing locks? There's a cunt on youtube who will open it in 30 seconds if you do.

That's all my point was (a) To those inclined stop being snarky cunts - the problems these guys have identified in the survey are real fucking cycling problems. Lights, locks, mudguards all exist for a reason and the survey had a line to enter other problems in any case and (b) For me I'm telling them that I don't think ""a bike lock"" is worth their time and effort. Feel free to disagree, but I don't think you do.

Bottom line presumably the students will pick themselves what they think is the best.

Lastly for sure getting wet is less of an issue than death but do you really feel that these engineering students are going to, say, change the street layout of New York or London in any significant way? They are engineering students, not miss world contestants - otherwise, sure, I'd say ""Hey guys, ask for world peace and ending poverty"" - you know they are doing a university project not writing a song about their dreams."

(B) People. i.e there are plenty of cunts are out there who would steal it given the opportunity. 

So people + equipment are the issues, not infrastructure.

I didn't say only my way is the one true way or something. Jeez, how insecure are you?

I just said 2 things that I believe to be complete facts

(a) The problem of bike theft is not solvable. It certainly has not been solved and it really cannot be solved.

(b) Ergo, the solution I pick, and millions of other cyclists, is simply to avoid situations where they would have to leave their bikes.

i.e the message I'm giving to the engineering students would be ""don't waste your time with locks - solve a different problem"" - if you feel differently, give your own opinion. That's fine. If you think the word needs a better lock, tell them to design you a lock.

Same with riding inside - yes riding inside is absolutely a way of someone solving traffic anxiety or issues they have riding outside. It doesn't mean every cyclist must do it ffs, but it's part of the reason, if not the whole one, why bike trainers and things like zwift exist and are becoming very popular.

I can't understand why any of this upsets you. Get a grip. You can ride any bike you like and park it anywhere you want. The engineering students were asking for feedback, not smartasses talking about ""getting flattened"" and saying there are no other problems.

The key point here is - everyone will have a different point of view - try not to get your panties in a bunch - this is why there are lots of different cycling products out there, solving different problems and providing different solutions for different points of view.

If someone wants to ride to the shops on an old beat up bike and tie to a tree - great, maybe they want a better lock. Hit reply and say ""I'd like a better lock"" - it's not a debate ffs. If someone else wears their normal clothes to cycle maybe they want mudguards. They don't have to fight people who don't want mudguards to the death to see which one wins or anything.

The only place my bikes exist without me sitting on them is inside my house. This is not by any means rare either. Indeed I'd suggest it's the more common case.

I'd accept that a secondary case is where people feel their bikes are secure at a workplace. Either because they take them inside or if the car park is secured in some way.

Although obviously you'd be limited to how much you can reasonably disassemble, you can get a good idea if bearings are sound, for example, by turning or spinning the place where the bearings are, cranks, wheels. You can check for headset play by putting the front brake on and rocking the bike forward (to see there's no play)

Check the gears work, the brakes work, the wheels spin smoothly and true (i.e look for wobbles.  Check the seat post isn't stuck.

Another thing to note here is not every flaw or fault is equal, i.e a damaged frame might make you look elsewhere, whereas deflated tyres or drive chain components that might be worn might possibly affect how much you'd offer, and will obviously require you to replace at some point so you'll need to budget for that, but are not necessarily deal breakers."

(c) Would usually take more than 12 hours for correctly inflated tyres to get to a state where they are unrideable. But it's quicker the higher the pressure. i.e I pretty much have to top up my road bike tyres before every ride. They've probably lost 10-20psi. Wider tyres with less pressure will usually go for longer.

One thing to note here though, if you use co2 at the side of the road to inflate, this will leak out much faster and should be replaced asap when you get to a proper pump.

Indeed, it's very typical in the UK that steaks are cut so thin there's very little notion of 'rare' or 'medium rare' in any case. The cooking of the outside pretty much cooks it throughout simply because it's so thin.

There has been a trend of late for the big supermarkets to offer bargains on big steaks though. Started by Aldi and aped by the others. These steaks tend to be thicker cut closer to the steaks you see Americans cooking and eating.

With these it's possible to recreate that USA rare or medium rare pink inside. But, to cook these steaks in the middle so they weren't pink pretty much would make the outside overcooked.

That doesn't really happen with your typical British steak because, as I said, you can cook the whole thing, inside and out without overcooking the outside because the steaks are just so much thinner. That wouldn't class as rare or medium rare though even if that's what the chef gives you when you ask for either.

Indeed the biggest issue buying a steak in the UK is that the whole ""how would you like it cooked?"" question has zero bearing on the product - they cook them all the same fucking way. Maybe if you eat at Ramsay's gaff there'd be a difference but certainly not if you just walked into the average restaurant."

This obviously ceases to be true if you mince the beef, mixing inside and out, to make a burger pattie. At this point, same as other meats like chicken, pork etc, you want them cooked throughout.

And, of course, the fact that mince and burgers taste great makes a mockery of this notion that cooking meat destroys the flavour.

A levels, which are exams done, typically in 3 or 4 subjects after leaving what is the equivalent of 'high school' but before university still use letters. e.g A university might offer you a conditional place on condition you get 3 As or an A and 2Bs in your A levels (A stands for advanced level here and came from a time when the GCSEs were called O levels or 'ordinary levels')

The reason for the GCSE naming is because, at one time, bright students would do O levels (graded using letters) and the rest would do 'CSEs' 'certificates of secondary education (graded using numbers 1-5) This caused criticism that anyone doing a CSE had failed before they even did an exam. So eventually they created 1 exam, graded using letters called 'GCSE' general certificate of secondary education and schools would save money by simply not putting the dumbest kids into the exam. But, as you can now see, they switched the grading to numbers pretty recently.

They didn't say ""I suck, I can't draw"" (or maybe they did) but instead they just kept on drawing.

cycling,ff93hwq,t3_esbxk6,1579703942.0,"TBH the biggest issue with 2 chainring road bike gearing (as opposed to triples) is the large gap in gearing between the front chain rings.

As others have said, the workaround is shifting a couple of gears in the back when you change at the front.

Not so bad when you have a route that's got well defined climbs and flats, but quite a lot of faff on rolling terrain, especially if your big ring is big for your power output.

e.g on 50/34 I always seem to be in high gears in the little ring or low gears in the big.

The reason for it is simply to try and give you a similar range to a triple but it's not always a great compromise. I would much sooner compromise some top end (which, most of the time you can tuck and coast the same speed anyway) and have closer gearing at the speeds I actual pedal at.

CX gearing, 46/36 solves it to some extent, but you do have to either ride on flatter routes or  be good at climbing. Maybe with the 34T on newer groupsets having a big cog in the back for climbing works well too.

It depends where you're riding. e.g Quite a lot of the rolling routes I do, I could just about ride them in the big ring. I might be 50x25 quite a bit, but you have the problem that if the road goes a bit steeper, you now either end up in 50x28 (which is cross chaining) or have to start dropping to the little ring and changing a bunch in the back, because, check it, getting to 34x17 which is the same gear as 50x25, is a lot of gear changes.

With a 46T big ring, in the same scenario you're in 46x23, and you've still got 46x25 if you need a lower gear before you have to drop at the front.

Of course eventually the road will go steep enough that you need to use the little ring, but it's about how much of the time you can sit in the big ring without having to keep swapping back and forth because the rode went up a bit.

At the other end. 46x11 isn't slow, you can do 30mph at 100 cadence and closer to 40mph if you spin at 120. I would be coasting in that scenario if it were downhill, and if it was on the flat it would be a very short lived sprint. In fact, I've put 14-28 cassettes on my bikes to get even closer gearing because, like I say, I'm simply not pedalling around at 30+mph.

Hence I certainly don't understand why 50/34 is the most common gearing. I think the owner of your bike made a reasonable choice putting 46/30 on it. Of course faster riders exist but they probably aren't using 50/34 either.

Perhaps the practical way of you testing this is to ride up the steepest stuff you do in the equivalent gear of 36xwhatever, knowing when you do that, if you put a 46/36 on that will be the lowest gear you have. If you feel you can climb ok, I'd make the switch - bottom line keep the 30T and if you ever go somewhere where you're doing a lot of climbing, like some mountains somewhere, you can always put it back on."

e.g I happily owned an android phone. Except I want 3 things (a) The phone not to break (b) Regular security updates and (c) I don't want a flagship phone that costs hundreds or thousands.

Now there was, at one time, only 1 android phone that appeared to meet these requirements and that's Google's nexus. And I bought a 5x. My son got one too. The sun shone, birds sang. Colours seemed more vivid.

But then the 5x started bootlooping, and Google brought out the Pixel line of phones and stopped making nexus.

So I had a nexus 5x phone that is, at some inconvenient point, going to start bootlooping (and I've already witnessed the hassle my son had when his did) especially when you have all kinds of 2 factor stuff etc tied to it, it's a complete pain. But there's no android replacement from any manufacturer that meets the 3 simple requirements I have.

I look around and the only phone that does meet them is the iphone SE.  It's cheap, it gets regular updates and it works.

So that move happened even though I would have preferred to get any other phone than apple. And without us even collaborating me, my son and my brother all ended up with iphone SEs. Albeit they have both moved back to android.

Absolutely you have to try and not get tied into the cult of apple as a result.

But why phone manufacturers can't just release a phone that uses stock android c/w the security updates and isn't £900 or something stupid is beyond me."
