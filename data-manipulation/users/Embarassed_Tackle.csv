He took revenge against the family that killed his son/daughter (I forget which) and in the Viking world that is A-OKAY. He even got goaded into it because the father of the other family (who played a homosexual knight who died of Sweating Sickness in The Tudors, also produced by Michael Hirst!) was a dick and hated Floki and also killed that son/daughter. Maybe he went a bit overboard but again, nobody would fault him for it.

EXCEPT FOR Floki who wanted to honor the Old Gods but also hated Christians but also wanted to live in a perfect society without vengeance/revenge which is against the Old Gods and seems very Christian. But he hates Christians and their weak god. But he wants to be Christian in Iceland and trip balls and have visions. 

Then Floki gets all mad because (that dude) took revenge on the family of his enemy who killed his child. So Floki goes wandering and finds a cave and stumbles on a cross from hermetic Christian monks who once inhabited Iceland and maybe Floki dies?

Now that dude is afraid because Bjorn thinks he killed Floki and that dude gave all kinds of furtive glances during the king election, acting like he made a shady deal with someone, likely to become King of Iceland (he makes a deal with the future King of Norway to become King of Iceland? Maybe he meant Jarl of Iceland? Maybe he's just a moron? I dunno). But then he doesn't get what he wants so he goes and saves Bjorn. Then he gets wounded saving Bjorn and he lingers on and survives.

I'm talking about Social Security (money for older people) or Medicare (healthcare for people over age 65-67.5) but also the Affordable Care Act. At first people who voted for the ACA under Obama lost their positions. Then US citizens started feeling its effects and began to warm to the ACA - things like expanded low-income healthcare (Medicaid) or no restrictions on healthcare due to a pre-existing condition.

But what Republican states have done is prevent the expanded access to Medicaid so that poorer Americans do not experience free healthcare. So states like Virginia, Florida, or Texas may not have taken that free money to expand their Medicaid programs. So many Americans in conservative states never experienced the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. 14 states have refused to expand Medicaid and they have some of the highest rates of uninsured in the US.

Unfortunately with healthcare an accident of history made it so most workers got their healthcare from their jobs. That was fine back when healthcare was cheap and a heart attack / cancer / stroke ended your life because there was nothing to be done. And various campaigns to expand access to healthcare were fought off by groups like the American Medical Association, calling it a communist plot.

PrequelMemes,feitbxf,t1_fehezb5,1579146673.0,"You weren't supposed to know it I guess. But other things overshadowed it. Like when the First Order launched a big red hyperspace lazer at Hosnian Prime and blew it up, and it was apparently where the New Republic headquartered. What the fuck is Hosnian Prime? Why weren't they on Coruscant like in the Prequels? Who is the black girl who runs out and looks up with a gasp at the big red laser? How were we supposed to know she was Leia's secret agent in the New Republic capital world, when all of her scenes got cut?

In that way it was a lot like the first Star Wars. What the fuck is the Senate? What the fuck is Alderaan? Why do I care about them? You just see Tatooine, the Death Star, and Yavin IV, and they are all out in bumfuck nowhere and nothing is really explained.

StarWars,feike3g,t1_fehvwky,1579140570.0,"Some of the comic books (new ones) get into this, where at least one Senator in the New Republic is in league with the First Order and trying to screw over the New Republic. Which is pretty funny. Plus Mon Mothma wants to demilitarize, thinking the war is over, and I'm sure a lot of planets are tired of war, tired of Republics, tired of Empires, and want to just take their ships and defend themselves and (more importantly) not leave military assets to large governments that may turn on them, like the Republic/Empire did. I think in the comic books that is kinda what happens with the Mon Calamari (Ackbar's species). They still have some big ships.

But even the old Expanded Universe canon had hints of this where the Bothan head senator was really powerful and felt his people didn't get the credit they deserved for sacrificing, so he tried to discredit Admiral Ackbar and Leia and Wedge and get more power for his own species. Which I thought was an interesting take."
StarWars,feijuwc,t1_fehs2zt,1579140209.0,"Well, there are still some padawans left in the Kylo Ren comic books. But I assume they come after Kylo and he kills them. He already ran from them once (there's like 3 who came back to Jedi Hogwarts to find it in rubble, and they assumed Kylo did it, but Kylo said he didn't and he just kinda ran off after disabling their ship and deliberately NOT killing them.)

Those Jedi Academy / kids of Solo books are fun and all, but after the Nth iteration of finding a dark sith spirit in the temple / some temple elsewhere, it gets old and corny as fuck. Everyone's always falling to the dark side and they gotta be killed. Then the lame Yuuzhan Vong are introduced who are immune to the Force and they basically take over and terraform/destroy half the planets you know of, and it's lame and corny."
canada,feihxuf,t1_feicvvu,1579138939.0,"I'll say that from a recent semi-interview with Harry, it seems like he worries the current BRITISH tabloid press is going the same direction as they went with his mother, Diana. She was hounded and demonized in the press when she was alive. It was insane. Harry sees the writing on the wall. Several outlets have had hilarious comparisons of British tabloid headlines on Kate Middleton vs. Meghan Markle, like Kate likes avocados for morning sickness and it's fine, but Meghan eats an avocado and they start talking about her supporting Mexican cartels by buying avocados. Or Kate wanted certain Victorian flowers in her bouquet and flower girls' tiaras and it was fun, but Meghan wants similar ones and they are a threat to children and will poison the princess child when she eats them.

But instead of seeing him actually do the moves, it's just jarring jump-cuts, and it must be as a stylistic choice because nobody could train that hard and then fuck up that many moves requiring so many cuts."

I always forget what happened in previous 90 day fiance episodes, and the fact that their interview (the one where they wear the same clothes with Natalie in the red dress) is interspersed throughout the season is one of the things that throws me. Like were they lovey-dovey throughout that entire final interview then at the end the producers ask that 'love' question and hit the jackpot?

Is Natalie saying she no longer loves Mike because of his recent actions? I was very confused by the whole thing, after she was gung-ho about having a child, supporting him and helping to work off his 'secret debt' (likely producer-manufactured crisis), etc."

American powdered milk during the melamine adulteration crisis in China was just one of the first big blowups of this.

MakeMeSuffer,fef6w7h,t1_feei1vg,1579049602.0,"There was an old joke that the Queen had britain's intelligence service assassinate Diana Princess of Wales for divorcing her cheating spouse (Prince Charles) and other silly things. So now Meghan Markle, who married Prince Harry (the ginger one), is encouraging him to withdraw from Royal life and the joke is that the Queen is going to murder Markle. 

When in reality Prince Harry is all about withdrawing from Royal life because he sees the British tabloid press viciously hounding his wife and fears that what happened to his mother (Princess Diana) will happen to his current wife, possibly ending in her death. And you can see the weirdness of the British tabloid press in the way they present William's young wife Kate Middleton vs. Meghan:

It's pretty hilarious to look at it from afar, but for Harry especially he remembers how his mother Diana was hounded by the British tabloids. Before Diana's death she was brutally dealt with in tabloid newspapers as a bad mother, a whore, chasing playboys, having multiple sexual dalliances, being unfit because of her divorce of her husband, being moody and vicious to her staff and the press, etc. After Diana died the tabloids were shamed appropriately and made her into a saintly figure. But now they are doing the same thing to Harry's american wife Meghan Markle and he is rightly alarmed."
MakeMeSuffer,fef5vog,t1_feeikkq,1579048913.0,"Diana raised her children as a human being (no nannies and all that), got fed up with Charles having a mistress for nearly the entirety of their marriage (Charles married her after Diana died), and other silly things. There was no conspiracy to kill Diana, otherwise they would have wasted Fergie (Sarah Ferguson, who married the younger brother of Charles, and also divorced him and such) too.

Basically Diana did things within the royal family that we see as fine now, but back in the 70s/80s/90s it was very new and strange, so people act like Queen Elizabeth would want to murder her for it. She was probably just miffed at the dramatics of it all, but the royal family has always been a shitshow."
