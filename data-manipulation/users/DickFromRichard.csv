fatlogic,ff6z2d4,t1_ff6fb0q,1579637832.0,"When I first started thinking about my fitness and health I didn't do any research, I just knew I should be moving more and eat better. So I signed up for a gym and started being more mindful of my eating. The first and best rule I gave myself was ""fiber first"", that is:

1. a good serving of fiber in any meal, if I can't finish my plate, try to finish the fiber serving before I get full (don't force in food though)

2. anytime I want to snack I have to have a serving of fruit or veg first, if I'm still hungry after that I can have something else.

Years later and much more educated about nutrition, I still keep this rule in mind. It doesn't take into account soluble vs. insoluble fiber, but it's simple and both types can help increase satiety compared to the same amount of calories in a fiber-poor food"

The fruit is by far the most popular item, there's way more of it than anything else and it's always the only thing that's completely gone at the end of the day. It's a small thing, but it's nice to see"
