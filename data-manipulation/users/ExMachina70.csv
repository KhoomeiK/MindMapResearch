joker,feexj56,t1_feeorno,1579043380.0,"The one thing that caught me about the ""you wouldn't get it"" scene was his constant reflection on Bruce Wayne's dead parents and how his actions had been somewhat a part of it. The last twist I mentioned seemed to fit the scenario considering that the person who Thomas was had changed therefore you could argue the whole concept of who his son really ended up becoming too could have been different. I'd really love to see an expanded world on this where you see through the eyes of a serial killer/psychopathic Batman.

I wasn't too sure till you mentioned it, but I didn't know if the therapist, in the end, was the same woman at the beginning. If not for the flashbacks to Bruce Ways I would have thought he was laughing about how he lost the therapist because the world ignored him only to bring her back in his life after he's committed horrific acts."
