value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across

marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling  the  heady  sea
vapours;  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so
redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it  to  sail  a  mini
raft  down  the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or
to  avoid  the  gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a
mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it,
it  can't  see  you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can

This is actually incorrect, as GPS doesn't require any cell network connection. The SIM card would only be used for reporting where the clamp/car goes after being ""stolen"".


CLARIFICATION EDIT: I'm referring to the ""loud alarm"" part; you don't need a SIM card to set off a built-in alarm if the device is moved."
