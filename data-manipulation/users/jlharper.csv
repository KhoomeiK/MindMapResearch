Those are the only two tools we have in order to train dogs effectively, but between the two you can get them to complete incredibly complex and demanding tasks.

Be patient and work gradually. Don't lure him with treats. Break down everything you want him to do into simple steps.

If you only produce the treats when he is **successful**, he will become successful much more often. Your job is to link 'success' and 'food/praise'.
