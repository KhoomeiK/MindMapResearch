Please know that no matter the choices you make and what anyone else tells you, God loves you more than any human can possibly comprehend, and He wants nothing more than for you to be with Him.

You are not ""going to hell for your sexuality"" (I have a few thoughts on the notion of ""going to hell"" but that's for another time). Anyone who tells you that you are, or who claims that any [adjective/group] is going to hell or isn't loved by God, is probably ignorant of the fact that they are exactly as much as sinner as you and me and literally every human who has ever lived, and has exactly as much need of Jesus' grace. I promise you that an eternity in God's presence is worth more than any earthly pleasure you can find in this life.

I apologize that that's not as eloquent or straightforward as it really ought to be. I'm still figuring out how to phrase all this. But please don't feel like ""living according to your religion"" means you need to live by what others *claim* is God's will; you can and should read the Bible and come to your own conclusions.

I pray that no matter what choice you make, you find peace. You are loved."
