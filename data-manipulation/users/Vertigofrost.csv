ClimateOffensive,fdlbcyz,t1_fdjvux0,1578520405.0,"On your first point, the *time* efficiency improves at the cost of sustainability. Those processes are not less damaging on the planet because they are more efficient. Also 1/10th of the population still leaves hundreds of millions of people, you will still retain the ability to specialize just on a smaller scale.

The fact that subsistence farming uses more land than industrial farming is not something that requires a specific paper, if you remove industrial processes from farming you reduce efficiency, if you reduce efficiency but keep output the same you have to increase something. There will not be a paper or study to describe all well known interactions because it we dont need people stating the obvious.

As I mentioned in my other comment, lottery sterilization is one option, across the board single child rules or just straight up killing everyone. Take your pick, I'm not saying its ethical to you but it may be required."
ClimateOffensive,fdjsrmq,t1_fdjpn3z,1578486189.0,"My sources are my own experience with subsistence farming and the amount of extra land area per person required to live that way. We already heavily damage ecosystems wherever we live in high density, I'm not sure I'll find a study specifically relating to it but its not hard to see. There are no healthy original ecosystems where cities are, yet when you get far enough out in the wilds you can have people sustainably living off the land, but at very low population densities. Maybe there is a study out there that says that just like there is a study confirming that air exists but I'm not bothering to find it. I can tell you this for certain, no high density human population has yet to live sustainably."

ClimateOffensive,fdjpd1w,t1_fdjozon,1578482084.0,"With less people you dont need fossil fuels to maintain decent quality of life, it's the density of human civilization that really requires that fuel.

In terms of a solution it means mass random sterilisation, killing 9/10th of the population would be considered evil. But it is likely we will kill each other for years in wars over resources and then maybe lottery sterilization."
