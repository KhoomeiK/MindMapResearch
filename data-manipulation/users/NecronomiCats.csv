AskReddit,ffszkze,t3_ev2jmg,1580199284.0,"Here’s a simple recipe that you’ll fucking love, easy to make. 

Pan fried chicken breast with coconut rice:

Start with the rice. It’ll take the longest. 
In a medium pot
One cup jasmine rice
One and a half cups water
Three tbs butter
One tbs garlic powder 
A heaping teaspoon of salt
Half tbs of ground ginger
Dried, sweetened coconut flakes for after the rice has cooked. 

Bring it to a boil, cover with a lid, and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer for fifteen minutes. 

While you were waiting one the rice to come to a boil you should prep the chicken breast. 

Thin sliced chicken breast, or pounded thin 
Season both sides with salt, pepper, garlic. Sometimes I’ll also add white cheddar popcorn seasoning, or Montreal seasoning 
Pre heat a skillet to medium-high heat. Just past the halfway mark. Coat the pan with a thin layer of oil. Avocado oil, or olive oil are both perfect. 

Once the pan is hot, place the chicken breast in. DO NOT MOVE THE CHICKEN AROUND. Let the pan and heat do the work. Cook the first side for 6-7 minutes. Flip, and cook for 5-6 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for a few minutes. 

By now, both the chicken and rice should be done. While the chicken is resting, add a handful of the coconut flakes to the rice and mix well. 

Super easy to cook. And it’s a quick and delicious meal to make for a date."

memes,ffsx6jp,t1_ffsw19t,1580196157.0,"I’m sorry...what?

Lucas didn’t write the comics. His name only pops up because he was the owner of the franchise copyright. He never had a creative hand in any game, comic, or novel. Not even the novels of the original trilogy! He only wrote and directed A New Hope. Different directors and writers on every single other film. With Lucas credited as “story by”. Lucas sparked a pop culture phenomenon, then piggybacked off of others creativity. 

The prequels and latest trilogy are directly tied to the original trilogy, yes. But poorly imagined and executed. Too many glaring inconsistencies for true fans of the franchise. There are aspects to like, but not anywhere near the benchmark for the best storytelling within the Star Wars universe. 

Speaking of only wanting to make money: What good reason could there possibly have been for the re-release, and re-re-release of the original trilogy? Mildly altering a song, or a character here and there with rushed CGI. Doesn’t add to the story, or the lore. That was a mother fuckin dirty ass cash grab. 

At least The Mandalorian has opened up a fresh storyline. Because apart from some comic, and novel, entries, we don’t know much about master yodas race. It’s raising questions. And giving the fans a badass in the Mandalorian armor again. Which was needed after the completely stupid story of Jengo Fett, and the bastardized backstory of Boba. 

Also, doesn’t make sense to condemn Disney while speaking praise of the latest trilogy. That was all Disney. Lucas, again, had no hand in writing them.

relationship_advice,ffruf4j,t3_euw0dx,1580166061.0,"Not worth breaking up over. 

Here’s some perspective. You didn’t want an exclusive relationship from the get go. Meaning you wanted the option open to see/hookup with someone else. Now that y’all are in a relationship, it’s a hypocritical double standard to be upset that she saw someone else when you literally told her that’s what you wanted. 

You trust her. And y’all have a good relationship. So it’s time to let go of the insecurity. 

Any time you’re feeling insecure, give her a genuine compliment. Something you truly like about her. Mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, whatever. You might be amazed at how that act can ease your insecurities.
