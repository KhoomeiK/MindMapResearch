The combat was awesome, the story was actually interesting, and it was setting up to be another multi-game saga.

Tbh I get a little upset when my friends don’t tell me I have something in my teeth or if my fly is down. I think we get caught in the mindset that it’s not our place, but it’s a small uncomfortable act for those involved that makes everyone else more comfortable shortly after, as long as you do it with grace and not just yelling at her in the middle of a crowded area that she stinks. Rather, take a deep breath, hold it, pull her aside and tell her what’s up.
