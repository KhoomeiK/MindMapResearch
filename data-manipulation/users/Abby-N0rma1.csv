My horror story is from when I was a kid. My aunt gave my family a pinocchio puppet but it just looked wrong. The eyes were small and beady and the face had too many sharp corners and edges.. My dad hung it up behind the couch and it would often turn towards and reach for me and my brother whenever there was no air flow, but as soon as it started it would go limp. We eventually convinced my dad to give it back to my aunt. Shortly after, her house caught fire and we never saw it again.
