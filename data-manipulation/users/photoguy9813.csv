Sometimes parents would pay someone more because they have friends using them as a babysitter, or it could be they know them personally, or in this case convenience. 

For example I don't shoot boudoir I'm actually not very good at it. But I have a client that comes in for it because she's comfortable with me doing it after doing portraits for her a few times. She could probably pay someone the same price and have it done better but she doesn't."

Do you go to a Walmart and make a stink about an item you don't think is worth it? Do you go to the mechanics and tell them they shouldn't be charging that much because your personally think they don't have the qualifications? No you just don't take their service. It's pretty simple. I get tons of people who try that on me going ""oh I know a guy that charges this much becaus their qualifications are such and such.""

todayilearned,fctkscx,t1_fctk0tb,1577946885.0,"> You can't control the economy, 

Thats a weak excuse many small businesses get through recessions just fine. 


> costs of production can go up making you run at a break even or at a loss, 

That means youre not pricing your product properly or the demand is not high enough to justify increasing the price, means not a sound business

> realiable suppliers might go out of business making your products shitty and lowering your quality, 

Meaning you didnt plan on having a secondary provider for your product or you didnt plan accordingly or your product is obsolete so suppliers no longer make it. Suppliers dont suddenly go out of business if the items they produce are profiting.

> demand might do down,

That means its not a sound business. You cant force people to buy things they dont want its simple. I can start a business selling whatever I want if no one wants to buy it or the fad is over and I dont adapt thats my problem not having a sound business.

> government might pass regulation among a crap load of other things that are outside of your control.

Regulations dont happen over night they take ages for it to enact into law, and when they do it takes a while to come into affect. If you didnt plan on any of that during the process of the regulation you are not running a sound business. Take a look at Juul, only sells vapes bans came into affect, guess what? Still in business somehow.


>  You can't predict the future, else all businesses would be 100% successful.

What youre saying is if a business opens up and people come in mindlessly buy items at whatever price is set, without any of the hurdles a normal business will face it will succeed. I guess money grows on trees too.

So if you cant plan for any of these it isnt a sound business, its a shit one doomed to fail."
