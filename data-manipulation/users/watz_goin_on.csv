Never saw the so called spiders everyone talks about, never had the heart problem, no impending sense of doom, no crazy hallucinations where I would be talking to people that weren't there. Also I am pretty depressed and prefer to alter my state as often as I can, and the opportunity presented itself. Any other questions?"

Just make sure they don't have the course set up the same way. One of my finance classes the grade was based only on the 3 exams, each one being 33.3 percent of our grade and the other slot with a different professor had it set the same way"
