spikes,ff2oeu7,t1_ff2h0oo,1579516273.0,"Well, yeah. That's how counterspells work. What I'm saying is that it's a strange thing to claim that the deck stumbles against counterspell decks while playing an anti-counterspell card and counters of their own. Surely you see that's a bit silly.

I'd be more keen to agree with you if my experience thus far has panned out the way you say, but so far I've won most of my control matchups."

Have you ever heard of a false dichotomy? Because that’s exactly what this is. There’s far too many factors that play into this decision for you to be sure that incompetence and dishonesty are the only possible reasons for a delay.

FFVIIRemake,fef4hub,t1_feeef5v,1579047977.0,"1) It’s probably true that the complaints would have stopped, but not because people would think that SE redeemed themselves and were not deserving of complaints anymore. It would be because there would be no one on Reddit while we’re all playing the demo. 

2) SE doesn’t owe us anything. They don’t have to “make up” for anything. A release date isn’t a promise; if it was binding in any way then we would be able to sue whenever there was a delay."
mildlyinfuriating,fef3xeb,t1_feeharn,1579047593.0,"A lot of that makes sense, though I would like to say that there was never a time when A was not true for human civilization. Politics (and indeed, economics) make up the core of our social experience whether we like it or not. Everything is affected by politics and economics; the simple choices we make every day like what to have for dinner or where to go on a weekend, the range of activities available to us to participate in, the array of products that are available in the markets for us to buy and sell, the types of people there are that we engage with, and even our language - they’re all dictated by economics and politics. 

I only make this point because I have a problem with people who are “apolitical” or claim that politics should “stay out” of certain things, despite most of those things being impossible for politics to stay out of. If you live in a society and make such claims, you are not apolitical; you’re irresponsible and ignorant."
mildlyinfuriating,fed6bps,t1_fed50lm,1579001001.0,"Well yeah, you're right. But you seem to be asserting that if you're drunk, then you are necessarily being manipulated if you have sex. Do you think this is the case?"
mildlyinfuriating,fed1pyp,t1_fecyom5,1578994297.0,"Sure. But we aren't going to do this all willy-nilly like typical Reddit squabbling. Your claim was that ""they're \[sic\] just isn't a winnable conversation about the problem of inappropriate sexual behaviour under the influence of alcohol"".

Most important to get started: what, in your opinion, is a ""winnable conversation""? What would I have to do to achieve this?

You're absolutely right. I've mained Hammer since MH1 on PS2 and I still can't play another weapon to save my life. But with Hammer, I've solo'd everything in the game with no problem; even solo'd AT Nerg first try in about 25 mins! :D"

mildlyinfuriating,fecxjr2,t1_fec8fz5,1578988663.0,"The answer to your question is that our justice system (or even our collective sense of morality as a people) isn’t based on mutually agreed upon rational first principles. It’s based on politics, perspectives, religion, legal precedence and is subject to all the vulnerabilities that come along with lawyers and judges being able to interpret and warp the law and its spirit. 

We have all kinds of contradictory issues like this in the American justice system. Partly because we don’t actually know what justice is, how to ascertain it, nor how to administer it properly."
whatstheword,fecvth9,t1_fectkfp,1578986619.0,Well yeah but... we’re on Reddit. I’m pretty sure that  90% of anyone that you click on completely arbitrarily will frequent gaming subreddits. It’s a popular hobby these days for all kinds of people.

It’s really simple. When decks do well consistently, demand increases while supply stays roughly the same. Thus prices increase. That’s why good decks are expensive. If your brew is genuinely good, and consistently places in big events with good players (read: not FNM) then it would increase in price. Period."

MTGLegacy,fcpye0j,t1_fcp8ufb,1577874817.0,"Terminus was pretty well received. Miracles was just born of the old CounterTop deck when they finally got a good sweeper. 

Before Griselbrand, the reanimator deck was a UB toolbox deck that played Jin-Gitaxias. It wasn’t uncommon for it to play a package like: Iona, Elesh, Jin-Gitaxias, Blazing Archon, and Impyreal Archangel. So when Griselbrand dropped they just got rid of the toolbox cause... hey, draw 7 at instant speed sounds nice! A lot of the players really liked it but i actually miss reanimator being a toolbox deck. 

It’s really weird to me to hear someone say Terminus is an obnoxious card. It’s not like Wrath of God is playable in today’s legacy, and without Top, the chances of it going off on the opponents turn is pretty low."
