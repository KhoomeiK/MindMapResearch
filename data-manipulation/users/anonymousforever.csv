They decided to not stop at the store when they couldnt get a parking spot by the door. They were in the parking lot and i walked right by them, so yeah, snapped a quick pic as it was rather unbelievable. When you're so focused on the other stuff that you're doing half the posted speed limit on a main road...youre a rolling roadblock.

What i saw was a hazard...driving 15-20 mph under the posted speed limit, distracted doing a medical treatment. How hard would it be to pull over a bit and do the treatment if youre in enough distress to need one? They stopped in a shopping center at a thrift store-- they were not on the way to a medical center. They clearly wanted to park there, had tried to get a parking place by the door but none was available.

I witnessed this yesterday. Posted a pic in wtf and commenters there think I'm the bad guy? I took a pic after I had stopped to go to a store. They were going to go there too, until they couldn't get a parking spot by the door.

WTF,ffb2x7w,t1_ffazipn,1579750435.0,The point is that if you're having enough respiratory distress to need a breathing treatment then driving at the same time is not a brilliant idea. Get the issue under control while parked somewhere then resume the drive safely.

She sees you like you were before your problems started and doesn't want to lose that image. 

I think part of her doesn't know how to just listen, maybe to anyone, about things that are serious or uncomfortable for her. She has no ""fix"" or advice, so she wants to avoid the subject entirely.

I'm sure you have multiple diagnoses, and have things that are hard to treat or just can't be cured. All you can do is tell your mother that the doctors are sure you're not faking, and if she doesn't want to believe you, there's nothing you can do. 

In this case, it seems you are better not talking to her about this, as she obviously lacks the empathy and compassion to at least shut it and let you get things off your mind, even if she can't quite comprehend the situation. Being a good listener is a skill, one she evidently hasn't mastered."
