It isn't a political entity, the UK is a political entity consisting of GB (England, Scotland, Wales) + Northern Ireland. That's why there is no ""British"" flag anywhere. There is only the UK flag. I'm sure each region has it's own flag (I know Scotland does) but not sure about the others. Would love to be educated about it if someone knows."

This is the UK flag in the pic so OC is just saying the term ""made in Britain"" makes way less sense than ""made in the UK"". It is not the ""British"" flag (that would imply Great Britains flag, which is simply an island not a political entity itself, and also leaves out N. Ireland). So this is in fact the *UK* flag and the correct label is as such.
