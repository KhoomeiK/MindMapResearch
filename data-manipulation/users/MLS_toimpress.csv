Other times with complicated lab results that don't  seem right (i.e. I had an outpatient sample come in with a glucose of 13, verified 3 different times on 2 different instruments) I've gotten a thankful doctor on the other end of the phone instead of having to describe the situation to an on-call physician who didn't see the patient.

I stopped drinking soda and juice and switched to only water with an occasional diet soda for caffeine. From there I tried finding healthier ways to make my favorite foods while also decreasing portion sizes. At the same time I cut my portion sizes dramatically for fast food. I still eat it, but instead of 2 meals worth its just one cheeseburger, no fries, and water.
