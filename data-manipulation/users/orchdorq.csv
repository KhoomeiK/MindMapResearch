The difficulty of isometric exercises, such as static arm balances, is determined by weight and *time*. Bicep curls might feel more difficult because they tire you out faster. But if an isometric exercise is held for the proper amount of time, it is just as, if not much more, difficult.

StardewValley,ff4w06p,t3_ermk0l,1579573783.0,"A few of the things, like fish, are discussed on the TV or in the books in the library. Liked and disliked gifts can be given out through occasional dialogue hints, but the main way is trial and error. Many things in the wiki are either found by data mining (looking into the files of the game to find information) or just because people figured it out by putting in a *lot* of time into the game (e.g. fishing every day for a year and keeping track of every single fish they caught in each season in every weather). Not everything in the game has a hint. But the hints that are there are pretty easy to find (TV, library, secret notes)."
pokemon,ff4v418,t3_eri55w,1579573165.0,"Mine is that Sun/Moon are some of the best entries in the mainline series. I loved Sun. Even though it started slow, it actually kept me invested and interested all the way to the end (including postgame and completing the pokÃ©dex), which most PokeÌmon games havenâ€™t done for me."
StardewValley,ff4tj0b,t3_erkxff,1579572086.0,"I 100% understand your frustration, as I have struggled with the exact same feelings. Especially for things like Journey of the Prairie King! And cutscenes, which I usually skip, but my boyfriend who is new to the game needs to waste hours on them. I have been able to mostly calm down by just reminding myself that multiplayer is meant to be a different experience, and itâ€™s OK if I get a lot less things done in a day than I would in single player; itâ€™s OK to play at an organic pace. But Iâ€™m also considering getting a mod like someone else in this thread suggested to slow down or stop time at will. Because even if I can *mostly* accept the different pacing and slight stressfulness of multiplayer, I donâ€™t really want to have *any* stress in my Stardew experience. It would be ideal if the game sensed when all players are in a menu/cutscene/shop/mini game and paused for those situations."

StardewValley,ff33skp,t1_ff31gq7,1579532952.0,"UI Info Suite is also a good non-cheaty one, it mostly just saves you time from alt-tabbing to the wiki every 5 seconds, and if thereâ€™s features you consider cheating you can turn them off in-game."
AnimalCrossing,ff25mwc,t3_eqs46h,1579494478.0,Every single one of these is fabulous and perfect. The top leftâ€™s kawaii-ness (and those perfect stripes in the corner). The top middleâ€™s pure wholesomeness. The top rightâ€™s out-of-nowhere surprise factor. The bottom leftâ€™s cubist godliness. The bottom middleâ€™s serene calm.

If you saw a friend, or even a stranger, make a simple mistake, would you run over and start punching them in the face? Of course not! Because you have a baseline of respect and compassion even towards strangers. You need to practice extending that respect to yourself as well. Mistakes happen and they help you remember what to do next time. Next time you make a mistake, you will get frustrated, but try to see the bigger picture and calm yourself. Hurting yourself is never going to make anything better."
wholesomememes,feol5e2,t1_fenvk3j,1579301668.0,"Human cake is bad for cats mostly because itâ€™s almost entirely made of sugar and flour, neither of which cats are supposed to eat. Xylitol (which is an artificial sweetener and may be used in some supermarket cakes, but certainly not all cakes), is also bad for cats, though itâ€™s not severely toxic to them like it is to dogs. That being said, like OP I assume the â€œcakeâ€ pictured is probably specially made for cats. Either that or the owner had to put up with a loooot of cat diarrhea for the next few days."
TwinCities,feocw0w,t3_epzoij,1579298346.0,"Today, while watching an MLK Day assembly at the school I teach at, I heard a phrase that reminded me of the whole kneeling debate. The students were presenting about figures in Black history, and when they got to Rosa Parks, they reminded us that â€œShe took a stand, by sitting down.â€ As have countless participants in sit-ins, sit-downs, and other peaceful protests. I love that mundane actions like sitting and kneeling can be used as such powerful forces of change. I hope the message of all those who kneel eventually gets heard."

StardewValley,fdths3p,t3_emxb5d,1578716950.0,"As others have explained the dye buckets (you need one each of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple items), I will add that there is another way to dye clothes. You may simply add your dyeable clothing item to the left side of the sewing machine (where cloth goes) and add an item of your target color, e.g. an apple, into the top slot. Run the sewing machine and your clothing item will get slightly redder. You may have to run it a few times (using a few red items) to get it truly red.

The dye pot method gives you color sliders that will completely customize any dyeable item youâ€™re wearing at the time. The sewing machine method is more intuitive and uses less items, if youâ€™re not picky about the exact shade."
NintendoSwitch,fdtg544,t3_ems1lc,1578716279.0,"Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games is slightly different, probably not as fun as Wii Sports, but it might scratch the itch. I havenâ€™t tried the Switch version but I enjoyed the 2012 Wii version."
StardewValley,fdpk7o5,t3_emhgnq,1578630895.0,"Sounds fun! Iâ€™d try it out. Iâ€™d like it if you made the weekly wage configurable though. 5000g a week isnâ€™t necessarily too much to pay, but to me I feel like it would be more plausible with the economics of the Valley if it was around 1000-2000g. But others may enjoy absolutely showering him with riches and would want to set it even higher, so customizability would be good. Also, maybe you could even have the option to pay Shane in gifts/food (kind of like with Better Junimos, if youâ€™re familiar with that mod)."
pokemon,fdpjeab,t3_embflw,1578630234.0,"I agree, and I actually wish they would have made this move earlier, and made Ultra Sun/Moon as DLC instead of separate games. I canâ€™t really explain why but USUM annoyed me a lot more than any previous third version games. It was like, I played Sun and I enjoyed it; but then they release a *slightly* better version with *slightly* more content, and expect me to fork over $40 (or $80 for completionists) more for it? It was so not worth it.

Because of my experience with USUM, when it came to SwSh, I decided early on I was going to wait for the third/ultra version before I made a decision on buying. But unlike a lot of people who were waiting, I actually got really hyped when I saw the expansions! I think they actually look worth the money this time (even at $90. Iâ€™m an optimist.) Hopefully this new director is able to deliver everything he promises!"
NintendoSwitch,fdpfjb7,t3_em587a,1578627306.0,"Thank you for doing this giveaway OP, itâ€™s very kind to give away copies instead of hoarding them or selling them :) I loved the demo of this game, it seemed so cute and happy! Iâ€™m glad that joy will be spread via this giveaway."
pokemon,fdpebyh,t1_fdo356t,1578626448.0,"And not even Fushiginu but Fushiginâ€™u. Though to me it looks kind of in between - the long stroke looks like ãƒ³ but the short stroke looks like ã‚½. 

Actually the more I look at it, the more I think most Japanese speakers would be able to tell itâ€™s supposed to be ã‚½. It often turns out that way in Japanese handwriting tbh, kind of like how sometimes â€œnâ€ and â€œhâ€ can look similar in handwriting. I donâ€™t think OP needs to sweat it."

Itâ€™s named after him now, but Pythagoras didnâ€™t â€œmakeâ€ that equation. It existed in other cultures before the Greeks understood it, plus Pythagoras probably wasnâ€™t even the one who introduced it in Greece. Historians think someone later figured it out and it was falsely attributed to Pythagoras. The guy probably wasnâ€™t even a mathematician (though he was an influential philosopher)."
wholesomememes,fde4g7p,t1_fde21wy,1578330960.0,"I see it this way: if you are happy while making others happy, you are not sacrificing your happiness for them. You are finding a way to make both yourself and others happy, which is awesome. Even if you do something you dislike in order to make someone else happy, itâ€™s a personal judgement whether the joy of helping that person outweighs the temporary unpleasantness. But itâ€™s good to reflect on it every once in a while and take stock of whether you truly *want* to devote energy to this personâ€™s happiness, or just feel like you need to. When it becomes the latter, itâ€™s okay to stop. Itâ€™s not your responsibility to manage other peopleâ€™s emotions."

That was in the context of early game tools and furniture at the Nooksâ€™ tent, but Iâ€™d be shocked if they didnâ€™t have more shops that unlock as you develop the island. They want to add options with the crafting, not take them away. Plus the crafting theyâ€™ve shown is nothing like the crafting in the mobile game."

So basically cast the line, press J immediately, and no matter how long it takes for a fish to bite, youâ€™ve only spent <10 in-game minutes to catch it. It was pretty broken."
StardewValley,fcb3h4n,t3_egpfzn,1577581843.0,"I tried to check using as many combinations of items as I could as well as on the wiki but so far, as far as I know, theyâ€™re not actually dyeable/tailorable :( Its probably just a quirk of the UI that they donâ€™t get greyed out."

StardewValley,fcawpc9,t3_egvvuj,1577578110.0,"Actually, the answer to your question is no. If you are dating one person, then start dating one new person, there is no acknowledgement/dialogue from either of them.

The situations in which it DOES matter are 1. if you are married and give a gift to a dateable character, your spouse will get mad. (edit: Actually, there is a *chance* they will get jealous, *if* you are at â€œboyfriend/girlfriendâ€ status with the person you gifted, *and* if the person is the same sex as your spouse. It slightly lowers your friendship points and your spouse has some angry dialogue.) 2. If you date *all* the eligible bachelors or bachelorettes, you will get a special cutscene."

Currently I have a nice symmetrical layout of ancient fruit, coffee, hops, star fruit, blueberries and cranberries, ringed with fruit trees and kegs. I prefer to use my mixed seeds in the â€œgardenâ€ I create in front of my house. Just a smaller plot of flowers, mixed seeds, cooking ingredients, and anything else I want. Then the cash crops for the season go in a big fully-automated field on the left side of the farm so I never have to think about them until itâ€™s time to cash in lol"
StardewValley,fc60h1h,t1_fc5v43z,1577469556.0,"Alternatively, take the pants you want to dye and a bunch of black items (things like void essence, void eggs, maybe blackberries?) to the sewing machine. Put the pants in the bottom left (where fabric normally goes) and the black items on the top. Then run the sewing machine - it may take a few times, but your pants will gradually turn black!

The dye pot method is nice because it lets you pick an exact shade on a color picker. But if youâ€™re not picky about getting an *exact* shade and saturation, the sewing machine method usually takes less items."

TwinCities,fc4d00c,t1_fc43lv0,1577413104.0,"Wait, Iâ€™m even more confused then. Whatâ€™s the issue with the trust selling their shares, if the bank would still be majority employee controlled?

Edit: OK, after looking up more articles I finally understand better. The most helpful article for me was this one: https://finance-commerce.com/2019/11/lawsuit-bremer-board-claims-disloyal-scheme-by-trustees/ and the counter-argument helped a little too https://finance-commerce.com/2019/12/bremer-trust-answers-bremer-bank-lawsuit/   
To answer my own question, the issue with the trust selling their shares is that non-voting shares can be converted to voting shares (though I have no idea how or if that process is regulated at all; it seems kind of silly to just let new investors do that willy-nilly). So any sale could potentially dilute the bankâ€™s control over itself.

I still donâ€™t really get why the trustees want to sell in the first place, it seems to me like they would benefit more in the long run if they kept the bank. Part of me also wonders why, if the bank directors are so heated at the trustees, why they donâ€™t just say â€œgood riddance,â€ and let them sell. Surely they wonâ€™t want to keep working with them after this."
