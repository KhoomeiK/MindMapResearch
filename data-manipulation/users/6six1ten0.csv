AskReddit,ffcguwc,t3_esr647,1579799177.0,Check ins. We send jobs out to shows and have to check them back in and do inventory reports and damage reports. It's slow boring dull work but I'm too thorough for my own good.

YouShouldKnow,ff7bjzu,t3_erqqof,1579645610.0,"My note10+ has this built directly into the camera. When I am taking a picture of tags on the sides of a skid, my camera will outline each tag and allow me to ""scan"" them.  Its actually pretty useful because the file size is so much smaller and it looks much more tidy when I insert them into emails or setup packets. Also works great for cash related expense reports. Photo/scan receipt and throw away. Small file size makes it easier and faster to upload to server."

Long live the frindle!"

This crescent 170pc set is only about $70. I just purchased to replenish my socket set. Unfortunately the case is too large to fit in my road box so I will need to purchase individual organizers but it was too good of a deal to pass on. I am not a mechanic so the lesser quality and cheaper price is perfect for my needs."
Tools,fdfe7j3,t3_el2ocz,1578359616.0,Looks great! My father bought me a set for christmas so I can finally ditch the repurposed fiber case and/or awp backpack and tote I currently use. I just purchased a couple organizers and a tote for the unit. My next step is to build a wooden crate to ship it and to store it.

AskReddit,fc1mw79,t1_fc14dgn,1577323566.0,"They pulled that crap at work and everyone started using dude wipes and the small ancient pumps couldn't handle the material and would get backed up and someone would have to go clear out the grates in the pump full of shit produced by 60 warehouse workers and carpenters and etcetera so we had a meeting and they said the bathrooms were shut down effective immediately. They put the padlocks on the doors and locked em and scolded the workers on wanting a fresh asshole throughout the day. Realizing the gravity of the situation they unpadlocked the bathroom doors one hour later. Signage was hung in the stalls asking to use only the provided toilet paper in the toilets. Then it still happened, then dirty dude wipes were being found about in the trash cans. After dealing with this for months, they finally upgraded the shit tank strainer."
