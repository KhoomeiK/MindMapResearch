FortNiteBR,ffgumau,t1_fffyuqu,1579915474.0,Building is the combat right now. Not shooting. I would agree with you. Probably would give noobs a better chance and bring in more players. Its money they're losing when less and less people play. I can see this game being more of actual Battle Royale. They did mention bumps along the way. Not everyone will enjoy this. But improvements will be made. Cant judge something unless you have experienced it.

FortNiteBR,fekph7l,t3_epndu6,1579204900.0,I agree with what SypherPK said in his last stream. They'll add more options in the future. I don't think they'll keep side grading at its current stage.
FortNiteBR,fekp1zs,t3_epnnsv,1579204649.0,"We got exited about the new patch. Weapon side grading for cheap mats was a plus. Personally, the game needs more mobility. Unless they're trying to give us that season 1 bush strat all over again. Its a new chapter and I'll stay. If they have been consistent with adding new things in the past, they'll do the same this chapter. But please EPIC, don't repeat Season X ever again."
