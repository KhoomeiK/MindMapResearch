MurderedByWords,fh93klk,t1_fh92r6l,1581372809.0,So is employing undocumented workers but nobody goes after the rich folk who profit off of these exploited individuals.

MadeMeSmile,fh4pt6q,t1_fh43eho,1581281026.0,That was beautiful! Thank you!
worldpolitics,fh3hox6,t1_fh3gdrk,1581269023.0,Because they would just screech that it's not true and if it is they don't care.

PoliticalHumor,fh357o7,t1_fh26mef,1581264946.0,My facebook feed tells me they are. Trump supporters really hate Pelosi and will latch on to anything to screech how evil she is.
PoliticalHumor,fh34qqk,t1_fh0qip6,1581264774.0,It's not though.  They really hate Pelosi and everything she stands for. They see anyone who isn't with them as an enemy.
