Wow.

The fact you read my comment, and then read me pointing out how you've interpreted this wrongly and you STILL say I'm making that claim is fascinating. If it's easier I'll just say it, so you needn't bring it up again - I'm not saying that knowing someone means you've raped them. You've just read it, and my further explanation, incorrectly. So that's that covered at least.

>For all we know, the guy in the video is the rapist, and the guy with the shopping cart is the victim. They know each other, so I guess it's plausible, right?

Are you a criminal lawyer or something? I'm not talking about innocent before proven guilty. I'm also not saying he should be locked up in a cell without a trial. I am, however, telling you that it is absolutely clear to see by anybody who has ever interacted with human beings before and understands how to interpret body language and certain tells that the man with the shopping cart tried to rape the guy recording. I too could argue with you or anyone as to why he possibly DIDN'T do it.

Occam's razor isn't there as an argument to prove that there is a small probability that the unlikely happened. If someone lunged at you with a knife, would you think he's a stand up guy until the knife penetrated your skin? Because without that evidence, the man did nothing wrong...?

I get your argument, but you're ignoring information (it appears) in order to be different."
PublicFreakout,fdvln6q,t1_fdvkb6e,1578748731.0,"I'm talking about the victim cleverly, and calmly, having a rapport with him that excludes any mention of his predatory behaviour so that he can confirm who the man is beforehand. How did you not get that from what I said? The accusation part is where the information regarding him attempting to rape him comes up. Are you honestly saying that I believe every person who has met another person has automatically raped them??

This kind of confirms my claim that people keeping an open mind on this have difficulty when interacting with people"

It's all fine talking as if you're in a court of law before a verdict has passed but if you both read body language in the real world like you are with his, I would make the assumption you struggle in interactions."
