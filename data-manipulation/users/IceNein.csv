Maybe I don't understand what it is you're trying to accomplish.  If you're just pushing a clean gain then it is literally the same thing as turning the volume up.

The concept of gain staging is pushing gain into various devices that will distort in different ways in order to create a more dynamic sound.

Gain staging might typically be having an overdrive, then a clean boost, then an amp.  You have a clean sound with both pedals off, you have an overdrive sound when you turn on the overdrive, now only the overdrive is distorting, and not your preamp.  Then you can turn on your clean boost which will boost the distorted overdrive pedal's sound and cause your preamp to overdrive.

That basically is gain staging.  You can add more layers, but each time you add gain, you're trying to change the way that the signal is distorting through it's chain.

Adding a gain stage that gives the signal +6db is not gain staging.  It's just turning the volume up."

Physical chromosomal gender is a scientifically proven fact.  What causes somebody to be transgender is not well understood.  Is it genetic?  Is it environmental?  Nobody knows.  It is not unreasonable for people to be confused about this.  You are actively harming the cause of trans rights by not understanding that it's a confusing thing for everyone involved.

You have to focus on rights and education, not on condemning every last person who doesn't understand how genetic gender can be different from a person's identity of themselves."

KenM,ffnrbg7,t1_ffnoli0,1580069715.0,"I wasn't aware of that, but honestly while I do not agree with her, somebody believing in the absolutism of biological sex is a widely held belief, and I'm not going to shut someone down because of every political disagreement.

Somebody can be wrong, but I really care more about what somebody actually does, and not what they say.  If she  was donating to a group trying to pass laws or if she was herself discriminating against people that would be different.

If you just shut people out merely for disagreeing with you, you lose the opportunity to convince them of your beliefs.

I mean this is what she said.

>Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who'll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill.""

She clearly believes that people should be able to live their lives however they please.  She just thinks, as I also do, that people shouldn't be harassed for having a commonly held belief that they don't share.

I'm an atheist, but I can coexist and even be friends with people who believe in magical men causing frogs to rain out of the sky, and convincing a man's daughter to get him drunk and then sleep with him."
BigBrother,ffnpann,t1_ffmwc7n,1580068892.0,"You've hit the mark with the overcommiting.  If you make a dozen alliances, it's going to come back to haunt you.  I would go for a strategy of asking people what they think, let them sell me their game.  When asked, I would indicate that I'm not sure, but they brought up some really good points.  I would only criticize people when the criticism is blatantly obvious, such as so-and-so doesn't clean up enough, or have you noticed that so-and-so spends all their time with x?  You have to make your criticism defensible without it being judgmental.  This allows people to think that you ""hate"" somebody, but allows you an out if they confront you about it.

Basically, pretend that every idea each house guest has is worth considering, and also imply but not state that you dislike who they dislike.

A solid final two is a good thing to set up, and integrating into an alliance, but not as a power player would be ideal."

politics,ffnm1mu,t1_ffn5v03,1580067681.0,"Honestly, the map stunt reveals his own stupidity.  He honestly thought that a reporter wouldn't know where Ukraine is.  He did not know where Ukraine was before he became Secretary of State.  He believes the location of Ukraine to be esoteric knowledge.  These are facts, revealed by his actions."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffnh6r1,t1_ffng15t,1580065922.0,"The thing that is dumb about using racist epithets against assholes of a minority is that it completely invalidates your argument.  If I was black and did something to piss somebody off, and then they called me an N, I would assume they're just being a racist.  I might even feel a little justified in being a jerk to them in the first place.  If you just confront them without saying racist things, then they have to take your arguments at face value.  If they call you a racist for calling them out, which I have had happen, you can just laugh at them.

I mean saying racist shit is also dumb on it's face."
