How about you berate the people that are sending our troops to fight illegal wars instead of the people that happen to be in the military for reasons you don’t know? This country is failing in so many ways and attacking people for joining the military to give themselves the ability to go to college, put food on the table, have a secure job, and have healthcare is downright pathetic. I fucking hate the wars we are fighting, they are illegal and offensive wars against countries that didn’t attack us. But making a statement like yours means you can’t take the though process further and look where the system has failed your own countrymen. Instead of directing your hate towards them, try directing towards the voting booth and volunteering for campaigns."

Your whataboutism is causing you to lash out at someone trying to send a message that we need change. Yeah you’re right, these issues are present in many countries and they never see the light of day. However that gives you no right to insult this guy when his message is bringing light to a subject. He’s trying to impact opinions to address the environmental consequences of our species, full stop. His comment can only be a positive in the movement towards addressing these issues. If you want to bring attention to how the world ignores the tragedies of people who are are on the bottom of the social and economic totem pole then do it. But don’t attack this guy for his positive intentions. How about you add onto his comment, build on it to bring to light more issues instead of being hostile and pissing people off.
