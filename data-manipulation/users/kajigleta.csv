I know my grandparents won't be around much longer and so I've made a point the past ten years of getting them to tell me stories about their lives and of their loved ones. I love learning about my ancestors from people who knew and loved them."

latterdaysaints,ff7vmih,t3_es4vnw,1579659424.0,"I think it's a case for personal revelation. Some people would harbor resentment if their spouse didn't convert, or resent converting for a spouse. Some would join or leave the church to be together. And others can happily live in a mixed-faith marriage. Only the two people can figure out what is worth it to them."

Student health insurance: $350 each per semester

No car. We did have cell phones. I don't remember their rates; we paid them ourselves. 

We got some PELL grants, SMART grants, and scholarships. We both worked about 20 hours a week at $10/hr, and so we lived pretty comfortably. Not having a car or car insurance made that possible. But bus grocery shopping wasn't fun."

latterdaysaints,fculbw1,t3_ej0cse,1577983519.0,"Hugs. I was in this boat 15 years ago. My husband left his mission early with depression. He did have an earlier engagement, but her family pressured her to break up with him. At the same time (before we met), I had a bipolar roommate whose fiance broke up with her because of his family's fear of her illness. 

Dealing with the unknown is hard. Take some time to sit down with her and explain your depression. Explain how it gets triggered. Explain your medication and therapy treatments/history. 

It's ok to take some time. My husband and I were in love/wanting to get married 10 months before the actual wedding. The depression was one reason; I needed to see how he functioned over time. (In those days it was common to go from meeting to married in a semester). 

My husband had some bad episodes while in school. He failed classes due to depression/apathy. After graduation and getting a real career job, he's been medication free and largely symptom free for 10 years. Still, I do worry about him often."

* You must show you are actively looking for work when unemployed.
* If you are employed, you are not allowed to quit your job, and if  you are recently unemployed, you may have to provide proof unemployment  was not voluntary.
*  You also can not intentionally reduce your hours. If your hours  were reduced, and that is what made you eligible for SNAP benefits, you  may have to provide proof that you did not voluntarily cut your hours.
* If you are offered a job while on SNAP, you have to take it. Turning  down gainful employment can make you ineligible for ongoing benefits.
* States offer employment and training programs designed to help  individuals receiving aid to find gainful employment and become  self-sufficient. Depending on your situation and the state you live in,  you may be required to participate in a state-offered program."
