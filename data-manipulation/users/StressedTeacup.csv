I get the frustration too, we live below sea-level and it feels like everyone here who's turning a blind eye is basically okay with drowning. Crazy."
camphalfblood,fe24ikb,t3_enlnct,1578834386.0,"I think maybe the rest of the Hunters are better at other things? Being a very good healer or sharpshooter or trap-maker doesn't make you a good leader. I think Thalia had better leader-like qualities than any of the other Hunters, but that doesn't mean the others are less valued by Artemis. I hope. If that's not the case, I agree that it's sad for the other Hunters."

depression,fdgdm2j,t1_fdgccyf,1578391740.0,"
Make sure you have a therapist you trust and try to share as many thoughts as possible. Be afraid of not sharing enough; I would've been treated for depression (and other things) a while ago if I just opened up. Your thoughts are kinda like symptoms, telling them will help the therapist figure out your diagnosis and how to help you. Also: therapists aren't allowed to tell anyone about anything you say without your consent and they won't judge you, just like any other doctor wouldn't judge you for having the flu. Maybe sharing your thoughts on reddit or writing them down somewhere will help with getting used to sharing. Best of luck to you!"
depression,fdgc89z,t1_fdgbaa7,1578389690.0,"I don't think lazy people would care, the motivation not to do something is higher than the motivation to do something, which is why lazy people choose to do nothing  [(source)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201410/the-psychology-laziness%3famp) Whereas the lack of any motivation would point more towards depression, I would consult a doctor to be properly diagnosed if you even slightly suspect that you are dealing with a genuine problem, because then you know what you're dealing with and can possibly get better."

Dermatillomania,fcwejz4,t3_ej7xpp,1578023621.0,"I'm truly sorry you had to experience that, and that you feel like scars and scabs are a line of defense. I can't imagine how hard that must be. The thing is, you're hurting yourself. Scabs and scars form because you do damage to your skin. Because you draw blood. And that's a problem. I don't know how to help you, because I have not been in your situation. But I would try coming up with either another type of defense, maybe drawing on your skin, not pretty drawings or something, could help, or seeking out therapy to help deal with the ptsd. You need to heal, and hurting yourself is not the solution, even if the constellation feels like it's helping. You don't deserve to be hurt more than you already are. Hang in there, I hope you can snap out of it and start healing ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
