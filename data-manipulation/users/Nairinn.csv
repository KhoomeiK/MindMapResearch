TalesFromThePharmacy,ffkists,t3_eu15ym,1580023463.0,"Some people treat the pharmacy like a credit card, they keep getting loans from us but never pay it back. They think we're available to dispense to their needs whenever they want. And by this point I don't know if that's entitlement or stupidity."
BeAmazed,ffjtnt5,t3_etzi8z,1580006638.0,This makes me cry. I know it's been said a trillion and one times but we really don't deserve dogs.
confessions,ffjter8,t3_etx0ad,1580006444.0,I think your fiancee and son would rather have you here than your life insurance. My boyfriend has life insurance and he mentioned that it will all go to his family and me. And it wrenched my heart out of my fucking chest. I hope every day he doesn't have to use his life insurance ever.
depression,ffjtaei,t3_etw3gp,1580006352.0,Hang in there. Apathy seems to be the biggest thing that everyone eventually struggles with. All we can do is maintain to the best of our ability.
AskReddit,ffjt1ld,t1_ffijfom,1580006166.0,My ex is in the same situation and I feel really bad for him. He's basically going down the road of child support and toxic relationship that he can't maintain. It's none of my business now but I hope he comes out for the better.
AskReddit,ffjsxdn,t3_ett7fr,1580006073.0,Dropping out of college. I'm recovered now but I am now inevitably behind my peers.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffimbcz,t3_etl02h,1579977296.0,"It isn't. And I distinctly remember my school showing me a video where a girl in college asks some public figure guest speaker something along the lines of ""why do you think america is so great"" and he simply answers with ""it isn't""."
tifu,ffim4ax,t3_etrazq,1579977161.0,How did he get a gash???
AskReddit,ff9z3td,t3_esc8vq,1579724594.0,"Realistically saying, I probably stumbled upon that time machine. If I could spend a day with my 13 year old self, I would probably tell her I have all the entertainment I was craving back then available to me now, and let her play with them and have fun because I no longer can have as much fun with it anymore because of my apathy. Might as well let her enjoy it."
Showerthoughts,ff5cryr,t3_erk8zg,1579587550.0,"Oh shit wtf you're right. But the thing is, if they weren't famous they would've stayed in school because they don't need to be the leaders of the whole world of witchcraft and wizardry"

pharmacy,fewme8k,t3_eqq83m,1579414575.0,"I love this, I wish we were allowed to touch pets in our store. Because there are some patients that always bring their little doggies and they are so tempting to pet."
depression,fewlqhj,t3_eqnbva,1579413877.0,"I think depression is like cancer. There's different stages. People who post stuff like that is in stage 1, where they don't feel the severity of it. And then there are the people hip deep in stage 4, where it's eating you from the inside out and you can't even talk about it."
Showerthoughts,fevt1zg,t3_eqjqfn,1579401111.0,"I would be so paranoid with this ability. Because if I have it, then somebody else also must have it right? Unless people with mind reading abilities kind of cancel each other out and they can't read each other's minds. Then I'd happily take it."

TalesFromThePharmacy,fevr35a,t3_eqhpsj,1579400490.0,"That third one is hilarious, that last one makes my blood boil. I don't know what makes people think they can condescend on people who are just trying to do their job. Most of these stories are never about the employees being rude first it's always always the customers. I don't know what people's problems are and harassing pharmacy employees."

depression,fepyq3o,t3_eq1xd4,1579334828.0,"Being NPC can be rather peaceful in a way. Depends on how you think about it. Nobody bothers you and you dont bother anybody. And if you maybe wait for it a little, you'll wake up and see the world around you. And start making your own story. But the thing is, the story's already began. And you will most likely get to decide how you want to end it. You don't have to end it like an NPC. I wish you the best."
relationships,fepwxq1,t3_eq81ow,1579333840.0,"I have a very supporting and loving boyfriend at the moment and he always respects me whenever I'm sad over ANYTHING. Of course I'm not sad over things constantly, but even so my boyfriend at the moment will never say what he said in the post. A person who supports you would never say any of those things. If they know you are in pain or distress they should try their best to help you, not ""teach you a lesson"". That is just condescending in all ways and he doesnt have respect for you."

depression,feo78vl,t3_eq0um9,1579296063.0,I'm suffering apathy to a certain degree right now as well and I'm right there with you wishing I had that passion that others have. Even simple things like watching a show or playing a game I wish I used to be as passionate as I once was. Now I'm just burnt out and wishing I had something again.
AskReddit,feo6s9w,t1_fen49o2,1579295885.0,That was such a beautiful read. Reminds me how it used to feel like thinking about these things.

unpopularopinion,fehjwwx,t3_ep2slk,1579118057.0,I thought this trend stopped when the picture of that boy posting a tiktok or something with his dying grandpa. It's really awkward and uncomfortable to see you do that to your dying family member.
TalesFromThePharmacy,fehil4p,t3_ep3oru,1579117278.0,"I love this story, wish I could share it with my coworkers."
depression,fehhpb6,t3_eoxun3,1579116757.0,I understand. For me it's that fear of losing that happiness and feeling the emptiness of the place where it used to be. It's that safe feeling of not having that risk if you're not happy in the first place. Also sad music sounds better when you're depressed.
relationships,febhhhv,t3_eo6ykz,1578958810.0,That is really adorable <3 I hope you all happiness and many oncoming family gatherings !
Advice,fe9jf9f,t3_eo51g2,1578938148.0,"To me, sex is not something that should be part of a closure. Even tho casual sex has become a thing, it has been proven that sex cannot be untied with emotional bonds completely. I only want to have it when I'm feeling love for the other person and the other person is feeling it for me. I would feel like absolute shit after casual sex, so your girlfriend's offer sounds like a bad idea to both parties."

datingoverthirty,fe6l7q9,t3_env27f,1578894611.0,"I feel shy and awkward around guys I think are super cute. I cave in and become super quiet. Either that or I'm teetering on the edge of being awkward. I think how I would've approached it is just ask him a casual question like ""hey do you know where *item* is?"" And follow up with ""thanks, by the way I like your pants, looks good on you"". I think that's the best roundabout way for a girl to approach a guy first. Nothing too wild, but I always think about the reversed role. So I try and think what would I be comfortable with if someone tried to lightly flirt with me? Just my 2 cents."

depression,fe62irn,t3_enrs4c,1578880332.0,"Yeah, I always feel like people may perceive me as wanting attention whenever the conversation leads this way. And I feel bad talking about it because other people may be going thru the same shit or worse and they're keeping quiet about it so I feel like I should too. It kinda sucks but I feel like it's part of growing up."
relationships,fe03z4z,t3_encilj,1578802497.0,"I would never ask this of my partner nor would I want my partner asking me this. Polyamorous relationships CAN work out, and have worked out before, but statistically, no. It's better to not take the chance."

unpopularopinion,fe014t4,t3_en52cm,1578800512.0,"Thank you, I had a coworker who claimed she liked being called the devil and she is one of the cringiest losers that I know. She always degrades others and harass people with her nonsense and is stubborn to no end. She's like a grown child who thinks there is nothing wrong with her and continues to try too hard to be a special snowflake."
unpopularopinion,fe00xrk,t3_en7oks,1578800394.0,Cheers to that. I cannot believe how shallow some of these women are sometimes. They don't think that we can see thru their bs? I don't want these women trying to be my role model when what they're doing is nothing close to being a role model figure for me.
