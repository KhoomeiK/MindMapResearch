depression,fekn7fr,t1_feklb57,1579203552.0,I get it. I go to my therapist even though I don't feel like talking at all. But I force myself and I show up. May we find the way out of our struggle!
depression,fekiwzq,t3_epm2ch,1579200996.0,I wouldn't really understand how you are going though. It's surely gonna be tough. Are you alright?
depression,fejx44c,t3_ep7rm5,1579187852.0,"Same as I feel. I'm going to therapy for 2 weeks but that doesn't seem to be helpful till now. Sometimes I think if I don't breath any longer, how my family and partner grieve. I like imagining that"
depression,fejgc2y,t1_fejfx2y,1579172907.0,I wake up everyday with this zest that it's gonna be a brand new day but I end up doing nothing. And the next day begins. I'm mostly home by myself.  I wonder does this anti depressant really work?
depression,fe06cy9,t3_engd6e,1578804189.0,I broke into tears when I watched it. It was so relatable to the situation I am in.
depression,fdqfh93,t1_fdq75qm,1578665330.0,My doctor told me I might have insomnia or I will be feeling sleepy. Either way.  Have you had any of this problem? And how many weeks did it take to adjust with your body?!
depression,fdq7obo,t1_fdq75qm,1578658332.0,I would give it a thought about it..
askwomenadvice,fd9u7xe,t1_fd8hm84,1578238083.0,I really don't have any friends except him. And my family aren't really close to me.
askwomenadvice,fd9tjzi,t1_fd9qxrm,1578237885.0,Your comment is so inspiring and really full of positive vibes thank youuuu
askwomenadvice,fd8ea2w,t1_fd8bfq7,1578217425.0,"The day we had that fight, I tried to drag him away from his friends. I kinda pushed him Infront of his friends. He kept saying if a person who weighs more than 200lb what else he has to do.  Later, I tried to justify his actions of fat shamming me Infront of his friends. I'm too much emotionally dependent on this person. I never ever thought of leaving him the friendship or the relationship.. I recently went to a psychiatrist and he asked me to think if I'm stuck in a bad relationship. But my emotions or my dependency on him never ever could convince me of getting out of this relationship. I'm on my way to my first counselling session now. Hope u find love care everything u deserve."
