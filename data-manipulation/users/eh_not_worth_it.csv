I suppose that's it not out of the realm of possibility that using an SSB could place pressure on a nerve; for example the dorsal scapular nerve is in that region and injury to it could result in problems.

That's SSB + nerve pressure is a pretty wild and speculative theory, even if it's mechanically plausible.

Nobody here knows you, or what you're good at, or what you suck at.  


I'm hesitant to even assume that you can do basic barbell movements well, not because I have any opinion about you (other than that you are a new lifter) but because I've been coaching a long time and I've learned to not assume an athlete knows anything.

That being said....if you can squat, bench, overhead press, and deadlift competently or are willing to learn (and hopefully have someone competent around to learn from) then 5/3/1 is a totally reasonable thing to try and it leaves plenty of room for conditioning, which you're going to need for special forces.

This isn't a totally prewritten program, but it's really all-but written out for you. Basically, you do lots of compound barbell lifts, add an assistance exercise or two, and that's it. You'll have to do a little reading to get some of the lingo, but 5/3/1 is a system a lot of people swear by and it can easily grow with you.,

Your upper body day, in particular, is a little weird. You apparently either really like shrugs or think they're important. 4 squatting/quad exercises in one day is also overkill.

You'd be better-served by heading over to r/weightroom and picking one of the programs listed there and working hard.

AdvancedFitness,fdhn38n,t1_fdgr532,1578426142.0,">MRI did also show an increase in radiological scores to the following structures: cartilage of the lateral patella (p=0.0005); semimembranosus tendon (p=0.016); iliotibial band (p<0.0001) and the prepatellar bursa (p=0.016).

Some of these things are not like the others, and they should be weighted appropriately.

I think what we're all worried about when we talk about running and joint health is OA, and that's what we're speculating about here.

Of course a hamstring tendon shows MRI changes after strenuous activity. Virtually a given. Also of zero consequence to long-term knee health

IT band? Also a soft, non-articular structure that was just subjected to repeated loading. Additionally, the worst thing that happens if you develop some issue with your IT band? You can't run for a while. Same for the bursa, and neither of these are directly related to OA.

Not sure what to make of the patellar changes in terms of long-term consequences. Not surprising, and radiographic retropatellar changes are virtually universal in the aging population, but I am not certain whether they are actually generally important.

I don't think there's anything surprising here, except that the tissues we're most concerned about (articular cartilage) actually looks better after the marathon.

In the end, people will mostly do the activities they enjoy.

I'm not sure this is implied at all. There's absolutely a sweet spot for ROI on exercise, but I do not believe that dosing optimally is of utmost importance.

I do very much believe that the optimal dosing (intensity and volume) of activity for longevity is going to vary widely between individuals. This is what is seen in animal studies on ad lib vs forced exercise, for example. For determining your own threshold, perhaps HRV and RHR are valuable metrics.

That being said, and since you referred to group averages (""Note that while exercise is associated with an increased average lifespan, it doesn't affect maximal\*\*"")\*\*:

I think what this is reflecting is that low to moderate exercise is what much of our gene regulation is ""tuned to"" from an evolutionary perspective. That is, it's the absence of movement that is harmful to us, and that exercise simply undoes the derangement this causes (to some extent). It doesn't take a lot, or high intensities to achieve this.

My view of the evidence that is available is that all-cause mortality is minimized at a fair bit more than what is generally recommended to the general population (that 150 ""moderate"" minutes per week you see all the time), but that you are well into the realm diminishing marginal returns at this point.

It does not appear that marginal returns (in terms of all-cause mortality) generally become negative, even at levels of activity far above this recommendation.

I am curious how you are defining this. If you mean ""they're doing more than would be necessary for good or even close to optimal health"" then you're probably right.
