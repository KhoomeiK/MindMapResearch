That IS the frustration. Being outgeared simply because someone else looted the right item and you didn't isn't good game design.

detroitlions,ffglf6h,t1_ffgjfdk,1579908947.0,">That is why 1st round picks from future drat picks are involved in moving up for a QB.

When? Are we talking about when teams like the Chiefs and the Texans moved up 10+ draft spots? Because Miami is potentially moving up 2 spots and the Lions would likely still have the same player available at 5. There's no incentive for them to include another 1st rounder no matter how you try to spin it in your head.

Also last I checked, Miami has the same future picks all of those teams have.

Edit: In the case of the Chiefs trade, they dealt 27, 91 and a future 1st for 10. Which leaves that future first to have a value of 484. 

In the Texans trade, they dealt 25 and a future 1st for 12. That future first had a value of 480.


Chargers offer 6, 37, future first (1600+530+484=2614) 

Raiders offer 12, 19, future first (1200+875+484=2559) 

These teams would have to offer their first 3 picks *AND* a first next year to even make Miami consider putting in a first round pick. Not even the Bears trading up for Trubisky was that much of an overpay."

Miami could offer 5, 39, and 56 (1700+510+340=2550) and still beat nearly every possible combination those teams could come up with.

The Chargers and Panthers could trade their entire draft class and not match that value.

Raiders would have to give up 12, 19, 80, 81, and 91 to beat that offer. But Miami throws in their two 6th rounders and they're back on top.

Even when the Bears traded up 1 spot to get Trubisky, they didn't include an additional 1st rounder OR 2nd rounder."

We were dead center of the league in points allowed, 31st in turnovers, 30th in QB pressures, 30th in QB rating. Sure our run numbers looked ok, but why run the ball into Snacks when teams know they’ll have all day to throw and our pass defense is awful?

It’s one thing for a team to struggle as a result of injuries. It’s another situation entirely when the whole thing collapses. The Panthers won 5 games with Kyle Allen. Jacksonville won 6 games with Gardner Minshew. We won 3 with Stafford. 

There are valid excuses for our overall underperformance. But those excuses don’t account for the level of suck that this team reached in 2019. We weren’t battered and broken down when we tied the Cardinals, or lost to Oakland. Even with a backup QB we should have been able to lock up a win against the Bears once. There was no excuse for losing to Washington, or getting beat by double digits by Denver.

It’s somewhat telling that the only thing that has looked impressive since Patricia has arrived is the one aspect of the team he has admitted to giving over to someone else completely.

ElectricForest,fetyt2r,t1_fetxhnm,1579381423.0,"I've met up with them in person and switched the delivery address for the wristband over the phone or online while we were there together. I don't know if it's still the same with the new ticketing agency, but in the past, you were only allowed to change it one time, so that offered some guarantee that it couldn't get switched back. 

I also tried to stick with people who had connections to me through friends, or friends of friends. That made both sides more comfortable, since we both had ways to contact each other through mutual acquaintances if something came up. Luckily, over the years, I've got Kevin Bacon levels of connections with Forest fam."

I can sell it for cost and save someone $100-300. I've already paid fees the first time I bought it, it's a fucking scam that Lyte gets to double and triple down on that by charging the seller a fee, and then the buyer another fee."

detroitlions,feoafu9,t1_feo7309,1579297282.0,"So first off, we were 3-4 when we traded Tate. We had a relatively soft schedule the second half of the season, so the team most definitely had not given up on the season at that point.

Same for this season with the Diggs trade. He was dealt after game 6, when we were 2-3-1 with a relatively soft schedule the remainder of the year, and prior to Stafford's injury.

>snacks was a pleasant surprise and a building block for the following season

But this is the key reason why you're wrong. Diggs was under contract for 2 more years. If the team was willing to add building blocks for following years just last season with Snacks, then why trade away a player under contract for 2 more years that can be a part of that building process? Snacks was under contract for 1 more season, and was already 30 years old. He was less of a building block than Diggs."

Some of them would have been welcomed moves for irrelevant assets. At least we had seen Diggs play at a high level before. Some of the other players on that defense have never shown anything.

It had nothing to do with his performance. We didn’t trade Snacks, Davis, Coleman, or Slay. All of whom underperformed. But we traded away the defensive captain on a reasonable deal for his position, at 26 years old. All to play a combination of Will Harris and Tavon Wilson in his spot the remainder of the season."
