pregnant,ffjb7s2,t1_ffj717v,1579994647.0,No joke... and then YOU get down voted!!! Apparently sharing a positive message just isn't encouraged!
pregnant,ffjb3wz,t1_ffir668,1579994582.0,"This is a beautiful comment, and your sentiment is beautiful. It is really concerning to me, the amount of downvotes you are receiving. The more I am on this sub, the more I think I should unjoin. A lot of what get's down voted is pretty disheartening to me.

Thanks for sharing this innocent joy."

vaxxhappened,ff4mo88,t1_ff3x2lc,1579567324.0,"Good on you for raising her this way-- I had some obvious skin issues growing up, and some of my peers clearly did not accept it, but I was raised in a way that I thought this made me special and unique. Odd as it sounds, I was very proud of my skin conditions. In fact, so much so, that I wanted to be a dermatologist when I grew up to work with other people with skin things because I thought it was so cool!"

AskReddit,fdqd9mw,t1_fdp7f90,1578663590.0,"I enjoy politics as a spectator sport, if you will. I think in reality, we don’t have a huge impact on policy changes (unless you devote a lot of time to it) other than voting in every local/large election possible. 

It’s so infuriating because these people are making decisions that impacts your every day life and you don’t have a lot of control there, but I find that following politics and understanding what is happening as least makes me feel like I have a little more control. 

Sometimes, many times actually, it lessens my faith in humanity overall— people often have self interest, or are short-sighted, or are so biased they can’t see through it— which is frustrating to watch. But again, simply knowing what is going on is enjoyable to me for some reason. 

The challenge is that a lot of people tie political beliefs to morality, so as you pointed out in some of your comments, they can get really aggressive about it. That makes it really un-fun and makes me dislike both sides. 

Despite all that, I enjoy following it. Perhaps it’s the same fascination people have with reality TV, but it’s interesting to me nonetheless."
AskReddit,fdp5me8,t1_fdp543x,1578620549.0,"It’s probably honest for him though, and I don’t think participating in t_d makes me a troll. It makes me a human, like everyone else in this thread, with opinions. Which everyone in this thread is entitled to."
AskReddit,fdp526x,t1_fdp4tns,1578620171.0,"Agreed. If you look at him through that lens, it ensures you really enjoy a lot of what he says, and the incredible reactions to it. 

I reckon he must chuckle to himself a lot when he reads headlines regarding his Tweets."
AskReddit,fdp4w83,t1_fdp4mtt,1578620061.0,"While that may be a large portion of Reddit, there are also some pretty intellectual and insightful people that hang around these parts too.... just not on political subs, I guess. Or, like me, they mostly lurk on political subs because there doesn’t seem to be a point in posting"
AskReddit,fdp4r56,t1_fdp4lc1,1578619968.0,An excellent point for sure
AskReddit,fdp49xq,t1_fdp3z0s,1578619649.0,"I really appreciate you helping make my initial point, which is that civil political conversation doesn’t happen much on Reddit. It’s mostly just attacks, name calling, or at best, trying to use argumentative rhetoric against people. Like here, where you very clearly indicate “you only like trump if you’re loaded, and you’re selfish”"

Hey, if OP was looking for karma, they knew exactly what they were doing."

AskReddit,fdp22e7,t1_fdp202k,1578618146.0,I’ve never been on to the thread— is it usually pretty civil? I’ve tried r/politics and it was a nightmare
AskReddit,fdp1zqd,t1_fdp0ypg,1578618096.0,"Well, I said 20+ hours because usually my patients complained they specially needed less than 20 hours (to be fair, a lot of them complained “they only want full time”). 

I’m not saying it’s perfection, but from what I see on my own little corner of the map, it’s improvement that enables more independence for people around me, which is good in my book."
