By running on a schedule, your body starts adapting to the higher demands by improving your cardiovascular system and increasing metabolism for all the functions /u/Lithuim described and more.

The Nazi party was officially founded by Anton Drexler and Dietrich Eckart in 1920 and led by Adolf Hitler in 1921.  By 1933 Hitler was appointed the Chancellor of Germany.  In what part of my statement did I mention anything about ""first fascist nation"" or ""Mussolini"".  Looks like you don't understand the difference between an ideology and a specific group of people seeing as your argument is claiming Mussolini led the Nazis and took over Germany himself.  Otherwise, I have no idea what the hell you are trying to say here.

Edit upon further thought: Let me give you a simple analogy.

I'm talking about apples and apple trees. You say ""ARE YOU STUPID POTATOES ARE VEGETABLES"".
