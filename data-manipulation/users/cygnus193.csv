loseit,fezrxta,t1_fezl8nq,1579460873.0,"You’re on the right path I think-you’ve got a lot of awareness of your situation and you went a few weeks without bingeing which is huge!! 

But those “ruts” run deep—they are patterns of behavior that will lead to gaining the fifteen back and, without intervention, maybe even more. I was in that pattern for a long time. I could white-knuckle for a few months and lose weight through dieting but then I would reach my goal and go right back to my old habits, gaining the same weight I had before. It’s not a pattern I want you to live!

So our actions come from our thoughts and feelings, which come from programming. Being aware is the first step, which it sounds like you are there. The second step is understanding-that you have all the control and power over your actions. (Sounds like you aren’t in a relationship with a controlling person so you are running the show. ) Your programming wants to point to the excuses for why you cannot change, and that’s NORMAL. Change is bad, status quo is good, when it comes to your brain. But you have a higher mind that can see the patterns and knows it’s problematic to have bingeing episodes every night. The higher mind can choose different actions that go against the thoughts and feelings (and anxieties) and those actions start to reprogram your habits. 

But that’s up to you. If you’re already overwhelmed with school and focusing on self development and behavior change would add more stress, give yourself this season to just get through it. It’s not a personal failure on your part of your priority right now is graduating with your mental health intact. 

But you posted here so this is my advice. Think long term. You recognize where you will be if things continue. Your career as a nurse is going to be stressful, long hours, weird shifts. You will always be able to use it as an excuse. Or you can start now, dig up the roots of your anxiety and binge eating, adding in therapy when you can, and see improvement in all these different aspects of your life, building a solid foundation of good habits before you enter the workforce. 

Do you have a friend or someone you can talk to about your bingeing, someone who you might be able to call when you feel the urge hit?"
loseit,feyywma,t1_feyw22b,1579452203.0,"You’ve got a lot of awareness which is an amazing first step. Do you think any of your issues with food, hiding, etc. perpetuates your anxiety?

The anxiety has a root as well-when did you first start feeling it? Also, where in your body does the anxiety “live”? Tight stomach/chest, racing heart, etc. we can often trace our anxiety to a trauma that made you feel unsafe, or not feeling taken care of by a parent. 

You’ve created a system for yourself to relieve your anxiety, and you’ve also made a little game about hiding your bingeing, which can give you an adrenaline rush of excitement. 

What other outlets for your anxiety have you tried-what worked and what didn’t?"
loseit,feyq42x,t1_fewv5iq,1579449149.0,"That’s such a hard thing to go through at such a young age. It’s not a personal failure that you’ve turned to food to help shield and numb yourself-you are human and it can feel like you will be consumed by big, uncomfortable emotions if you don’t swallow them down. Your physical weight quite literally puts distance and “padding” between you and the world.

So dieting tends to take away that shield and allow the flood in. It’s not surprising it feels like a mental battle. You have to choose to face hard things that you’ve likely been burying deep for years. The “you” who wants to shed the weight has to fight the “you” who has been keeping you safe. 

Let me know if you think I’m way off base here. 

And can you think of other shielding activities you have? Common ones are like alcohol, shopping, gambling, social media scrolling, video games."
loseit,fewn3e6,t1_few3qt7,1579415336.0,"Pantry food and pasta aren’t “bad”, especially if you’ve been running yourself on an empty tank for 8+ hours. 

I would highly recommend figuring out a way to get some calories into you before the point where you get desperately hungry. The body (and the brain especially) need calories for energy. It will look for opportunities to hoard those calories at any given opportunity. Your body will eat extra and store it as body fat to use as fuel for the days you don’t prioritize breakfast and lunch. 

When did you first notice this pattern? Did it start when you stopped having regular meal times?

If you had a patient tell you she has this bingeing problem at night and had the same eating schedule as you do, what advice would you give her?"
loseit,fewmjjf,t1_fevu30o,1579414736.0,"My first suggestion is to pick a program and commit to consistency over perfection. Give it 90 days before switching up what you’re doing. 
If you only use the scale for judging your success you’re going to need to see lower numbers to keep going.. it can be really frustrating to your inner “monitor” that your efforts aren’t rewarded. 
So my next suggestion is to pick another way to gauge progress-maybe take a waist measurement, take a few pictures to compare, and/or keep a simple journal where you can list your daily energy levels to look for trends. If you FEEL better as you’re doing the work it’s going to make this easier to stick to. 
If you want some information on why the scale may not be reflecting the work you’ve put in search YouTube for “Jordan Syatt Weight Fluctuations” he explains it so well!
You’ve got this!"
loseit,fevgz7t,t1_feuvz7y,1579397299.0,"I highly recommend [365 Days of Crockpot](365daysofcrockpot.com) because she literally used a crockpot every single day and lists which she thinks are the best recipes and which she thinks were busts. 

You’re on the right path for her and your family, it’s stressful to be dealing with half of your challenges, let alone having an illness on top of everything else! I would just gently encourage you to see past the weight gain as this big issue or a failure on her or your part. There is no shame in that her body is responding normally to a fairly abnormal situation. It’s not a permanent state. And I t’s going to be ok. Keep in mind the ideas of self love, acceptance, and forgiveness for you both!"
loseit,fevfa0t,t1_feuwabw,1579396724.0,"This makes me so happy for you both, I’m glad to have helped but you did the work and that’s incredible! Much love, you’ve got this."
loseit,feuj80r,t3_eqmwql,1579387022.0,"I went through dental hygiene school, which is a similarly rigorous program so I've been there! Can you describe your bingeing episodes? What foods you go for? If you raid the fridge/pantry for snacks or if you go to the store? How long your episodes last? And any more info you can give...

And what are your food habits throughout the day? Do you have 3 meals and 2 snacks or do you tend to skip meals?"
loseit,feuh87x,t3_eqkjun,1579386558.0,"You're absolutely correct, you need your husband and your babies need their father. It sounds like he has been battling to make the changes you asked, and you recognize that he's still struggling in certain areas. That already tells me you have a strong capacity for empathy!

What stood out most to me is, have you asked HIM ""How can I best support you?"" And if he had said, I just need two hours to reset, could you have provided that? 

If you COULD give him two hours to go off alone, what led to the heated phone conversation? Anger is generally a secondary emotion, so look for the primary hurt -did you feel shut out? Disregarded? Disrespected? Lied to?

Then have that conversation. Use an ""I"" statement and make a reasonable, realistic request. Try to use ""and"" instead of ""but"", and own your part. ""Hey Husband, I know you were struggling this morning.. and I felt \[\[really confused and hurt\]\] when I didn't hear from you for several hours... I want to be a supportive teammate and I was wondering if you had ideas for how I could show up better. Here are some ideas that I had...""

Those moments of courage when you speak from your heart, where you show that you're human and imperfect but willing to own it is so powerful.

I hope this helps. Let me know your thoughts!"
loseit,feubmbw,t3_eqkpci,1579384988.0,"I think the priority will be for her to heal! Once she is off the steroid medication she'll drop the excess water weight and she can add back in the physical activity.

As for eating healthier, it takes being realistic. Looks like you guys are aware of your challenges. Do some trial and error with meal planning, meal services, maybe an instant pot or crockpot? Pinterest has great recipes, type ""easy, quick"" when searching.

What I do on busy weeks is cook on Sunday. Large casseroles that freeze well or will keep in the refrigerator to eat throughout the week."
loseit,feu9aju,t3_eql2dq,1579384372.0,"You've taken a lot of fantastic steps!

Can I ask how long you've been at this?"
loseit,feu81k6,t3_eqmflg,1579384032.0,"Having this awareness is such a key first step!

Can I ask how long you've been struggling with your weight, and how long you've been struggling with depression/anxiety? Do you think there's a connection between them or did one happen first?

And then how many times have you tried dieting and what kind of results do you tend to see?"

educationalgifs,fcp8z43,t1_fciklmt,1577854517.0,"Without intervention yes, a missing tooth creates a void and the surrounding teeth will migrate toward the space. It creates many other problems. But I also have patients who lost a single tooth to fracture or decay and live happily without addressing the space. The difference is good plaque control and regular dental exams to catch and treat small problems before they get bigger."
educationalgifs,fchb2f1,t3_eh5xcz,1577648890.0,"Dental Hygienist here. The same process happens to your gums when you’re inconsistent with brushing/flossing.. starts as gingivitis within about 3 days. Without regular preventive cleanings it can progress to periodontitis-where your body’s inflammatory response starts breaking down the bone support that holds your teeth in. 
Get to your dental appointments folks, even if you have no insurance. It’s worth the investment to have healthy, pain-free teeth for life."
sex,esl34jl,t3_c89nz7,1562078333.0,"There are 8-9 THOUSAND nerve endings in the clitoris, and so few in the vaginal walls there isn’t even a scientific tally. The nerves in the first couple of inches are actually the legs or “crura” of the clitoris that extend into the body and wrap around the vagina. 

The women who can orgasm from PIV sex are 90% of the time having their clit stimulated from the inside. 

Read “Come as you are” by Emily Nagoski if you’re interested in the science of female vs male sexual experience."
