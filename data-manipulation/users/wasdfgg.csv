It’s all a bunch of bullshit, the only reason redditors bash on Christianity is because it’s the most popular religion in North America.

Our yard in unregulated and basically nobody outside knows anything, so they can get away with some very illegal shit. I’ve worked plenty of 12+ hour shifts but the longest one was I think 9am-midnight without lunch because we were given too much work to do with no relief. Had we not completed our main industry switches it’s guaranteed we would hear about it and be in shit even after working 12+ hours non stop."

But honestly I’ve heard you basically sell your soul to the railroad when you go to CN, and I don’t know if I want to make a career out of it yet. 

So I wouldn’t even want to join CN at this point. My schedule is 4 on 4 off I doubt I’d ever get that at CN. 

So right now I’m happy where I’m at and I’m sure I could join CN with my experience as long as I pass the course."

I wouldn’t go calling myself a locomotive engineer just because I drive a train at work, I literally have no schooling or degrees related to my work. 

The lead hands at my work are also called engineers by title but they do the exact same job as the conductors. We just switch out half way into the shift who works on the ground and who drives the locomotive. And there’s not always a lead hand on the crew either... my company is weird."
