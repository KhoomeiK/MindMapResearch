aww,fezzpbc,t1_fezt041,1579463631.0,This fact is Elkhound specific. However I'm sure google would be a great place to start. Or if you go on the CKC or AKC websites they may have books that you could read ..I tend to just do research on specific breeds I like . I also have a bookshelf full of books about dogs and breeds and suck.

relationship_advice,fdfvvfz,t1_fdfuggd,1578371605.0,"Everyone's version of dangerous is different. For starters and i said it was a philosophical discussion, not a fight. Being an adult doesn't just mean financial and mental independence. There is so much more. Also everyone's version of adulting is different because we all lead different lifestyles.. I didn't want to go to church, that ties into metal stability, decision making..being an adult. It's not about pleasing my parents at all..they can believe what they want to and I can believe what I want to..no one likes being forced to do what their not into. 
Sure .I can respect their house their rules, as long as it doesn't take away my freedom..."
