You are so adamant about portraying social justice people and feminists as one superficial group. I advise you to look into the value of inclusion, be it more females, a more balanced cast not carried by strong male leads, or just more people of color. You can give me examples of shitty movies, sure, and I won't defend them or deny hollywood wants money, but you can't say that represents the actual argument for inclusion and then also say ""You are strawmanning and twisting the argument into some idiotic claim"". 

>quite apparent looking at these social justice era diversity centric films/games and the ones that media claimed were not diverse enough and spoke against.

Thoroughly unconvinced. You're talking about a vocal minority, maybe a handful of movies that are 'social justice era diverse'. Or are you saying background characters of color are 'token coloreds' and should be white unless their race is relevant? Because that's what I believe was spoken against; needlessly all-white casts. Do you think Jason Mamoa was a bad cast for aquaman because aquaman should be white?

You kind of already did that. Three lengthy sentences about being cynical and overly sure of yourself don't constitute 'psychoanalysis' in my book (don't mean to sound smart by saying 'book', it's just an expression). You calling me a psychoanalist and a psychologist isn't a stretch? Do you think only psychiatrists can think about motives? That's on you, I disagree with that notion completely. I think it's strange to say 'we're talking so I won't stop responding because that's how conversations work' as if you're forever trapped now and have no choice here. Do you think that reasoning will keep every single person involved in every single conversation, or is it possible it's actually a character trait? Also, pseudoscientific makes no sense at all, I didn't claim to be scientific here at any point. Thinking someone is rude isn't pseudoscientific, not even if you speculate on why. You make it sound like I forgot to mention my sources lmao, as if my 'lengthy comment' was a focussed documentation lmao.

>“well you did it too!!!” after I asked you a simple question.

Your simple question was 'why would you take ""I can't give a fuck about you"" literally?'. My response was not 'you did it too'. Keep your story straight, you're mixing shit up. Read it back, you never asked me the 'simple question' of why I'm supposedly psychoanalysing you, you only stated I did. That was what I responded ""well you did it too!!!"" to, including all those exclamation marks, thanks for that quote.

facepalm,fdkqigw,t1_fdkq5tx,1578509049.0,"It counts as medical prodecure, but you really shouldn't see those extreme cases as examples of what the majority of one side in this gender discussion wants. This discussion has escalated into one vocal minority screaming at the other vocal minority.

I don't think it's fair to say that that side of the gender discussion wants to medicate children who 'want to be a boy/girl', I think that's a tiny minority."

videos,fdkf9k6,t1_fdke450,1578502628.0,"I focus on hollywood because this entire conversation is led by Ricky Gervais' comments on Harvey Weinstein. I don't see how washington is relevant in this specific discussion other than 'they have the same problem', but I think I agree with your point that women (and also men, as victims or just as people who oppose this shady business) deal with the same problem in many area's."
videos,fdkenm0,t1_fdkbx39,1578502257.0,"There are many reasons. There is the power difference, which makes people feel pressured to do things they don't want to because they believe that to be the only way to become famous (which possibly is true, which makes it worse). Then there is no safetynet to prevent either party from going back on the deal and demanding more, or not hold up their end of the bargain at all.

Sex for fame also gives the person in power control over the other, a sort of control that can easily turn into blackmail and can be abused for years. Often times these deals are made without properly weighing the pro's (money) and con's (trauma, abuse, regret), or the con's are misrepresented as being no big deal.

Then practically, this creates a divide between the actors that do this and the actors that don't, putting those who don't want to prostitute themselves at a disadvantage. There's a huge risk of underage sex, blackmail through secret recordings, spreading of diseases, physical and mental abuse (abuse is much 'easier' to do to someone you have power over, and having sex as part of a deal is a huge part of 'power'). There is no oversight over whether the deal is fair and lies can run rampant.

It also really fucking grosses me out. Not prostitution itself, but this kind of under-the-table corruption of those who pretend to be the classiest, most talented and wealthiest.

I could keep going, but I think the biggest point is that this is not prostitution. I can see arguments for prostitution being win-win and totally legal, but those arguments and that legal situation does not describe the subject we're discussing right now.

Edit: one more point: women are still the victim of sexism in a whole lot of area's. Having hollywood as 'a negative role model' can do so much damage, where having hollywood as a positive rolemodel can do so much good."
videos,fdkacvp,t1_fdka1vq,1578499658.0,"Because it creates a situation in which sucking dick becomes expected or so common you'll lose parts for not doing it. That, in turn, creates a community of people who think this kind of sexual exploitation is OK and close their eyes to more serious abuse.

And also because it's fucking disgusting and makes me personally hate hollywood."
videos,fdk7trk,t1_fdk4hb3,1578498054.0,I'd say that the situation before that was a problem as well. 'suck my dick a few times and I'll make you famous' is wrong even if both parties agree to it.
news,fdho92v,t1_fdhhz99,1578426835.0,"Nice cherry picking, but I remember you saying something about 'allllll these people in alllll these posts' also downvoting everyone who disagrees; ""not a single one provides proof"". That's the hypocrisy. 

Also, you're not 'telling' anyone to stop, no one reads your comment. You're whining about it.

Also also, note how I didn't really ""try and argue"" with you, I gave you the win you so desperately crave and suggested some self-reflection.
