AmItheAsshole,ffpanze,t3_eueopu,1580090331.0,"NAH - My mom was a horder, and if our moms are at all alike, she'll never deal with it on her own. Not physically, and not mentally. 

I think you are on the right track with cleaning while she is away, for sure. Otherwise, it would be super stressful for her. 

If it were me, I would buy her something that beautifies her space, or something she's always wanted that wouldn't fit because of the clutter and try to frame the cleaning around that.  Or really, whatever works for you - that's just what came to my mind. 

My point is she probably knows she has a problem and she feels some shame around it.  There's no need to shine a light on it. Make it a true gift for her. 

As far as what to let her look through, I would say if it has potential for use - for example, an old sour cream container could be used for leftovers - save a reasonable amount (7 of the 20 you found...?) and don't let her know you threw the rest out.  She probably has no idea how many she has.  Just make sure that if you find copious amounts of anything, respect that it's important to her, and keep some. 

If it's obvious garbage, like a chocolate bar wrapper, you don't need to show her. 

It's harder with broken stuff, because you don't know what holds sentimental value, and what is 'an investment' to be sold later for more money.  I can't tell you what to do here -  I guess I'd put it in the 'go through in your leisure' container, that you store in the shed. 

Good luck!  I feel ya."

If you're looking for a way to balance the relationship, this is how I was trained to handle group settings where one person was taking up all the space:

Each person gets a certain amount of rocks, coins, whatever. Let's say 10, for the purpose of this conversation. 

Every time a person talks about themselves, they put one of their rocks in the centre of the circle. 

Everytime a person validates, advises etc. - basically gives of themselves to the other person, they take a rock from the centre. 

Once you're out of rocks, you can't talk anymore, unless it's to validate our help another person. 

Why?  Because it's fair and balanced. 

You don't have to actually do this if you think it's going to tank, but it serves as a great way to quantify the equality of a friendship, if something feels off."

EarthPorn,ffnzsr0,t3_euaizy,1580072748.0,"I was living in a cabin on Vancouver Island a few years back, and there was this old Tom cat that used to hang around. I put blankets out in the winter for him, and would leave him cans of tuna to eat. 

One day, a feral kitten, around six months old started hanging around my neighbour's house and they asked me to take it, so I did. 

First cat I've ever really had as a pet. Must say, crazy as fuck. 

Anyway, the very next night, Tom cat is trying to get in my cabin. This has never happened before, as he's super shy and would never come to me - if he had, he would've been my pet instead of crazy feral kitty, because I work on a first come, first serve basis. 

He's meowing to come in, but I'm anticipating a cat fight if I do, so I tell him to go away. 

Then, he spread eagles on my window screen, meowing really loud. I didn't understand at the time, felt really uncomfortable with the situation, and closed the blinds. 

That was the last I saw of him.  He never came back, and for the longest time, I thought it was because I was an asshole, so he moved on. 

Then I learned on Reddit that if a cat is spread eagle at your window and screaming, he is being stalked by a predator. 

There was a fucking cougar in my yard and I didn't even know it. 

I've felt terrible guilt for my actions every since I realised what happened.

legaladvice,fffzc5g,t1_fffuit8,1579895093.0,"I appreciate this boundary, and believe it is the best gauge to use across the board, but to answer your question:

If I had to choose between having a family member who loved me and had been treating me for 22 years, and a stranger who was a medical professional, I would choose my mom for the common treatments and the nurse for things above her ability level. 

I absolutely support the nurse documenting the incident, but judging from OP's post, it sounds like whoever followed up may have escalated beyond what was necessary.  

Nurses suffer burnout, and are not always as gentle and kind as they are portrayed in the movies. They don't know me, or care about me like mom. 

Nurses are human. Sometimes they are addicts, sometimes they are there for the money, sometimes they don't do their job to the best of their ability.  You don't know what you're going to get. 

Not dissing nurses, but you can't paint them all with the same Florence Nightengale brush, despite the pledge.  

Nurses don't understand my non verbal communication as well as my regular caregiver of 22 years would. 

Nurses are trained to respond and de-escalate common scenarios in a way that would work for the highest percentage of patients - mom has decades of experience anticipating the needs, and reading and responding to the cues of one single person.  Me. 

If we are talking about comfort level, mom wins.

 It sounds like you're moping just fine, but your final rinse should be a ""dry mop"" which just means that it is very well wrung out before using. 

2 - Don't over think things - you can't eradicate all the germs in your house, but they will eventually die on their own. Just do your best and let nature do the rest. 

3 - There are no hard and fast rules for laundry soap. You are taking the right things into consideration, and the lines are just a guide - a reference for your preference, if you will. Large loads and extra grimy loads take more soap. 

Oxy Clean, white vinegar, water softener (calgon?), borax all help with whitening, if you're having issues with that.

6 - I lay really long boot mats underneath the litter box to get the majority of it, and use the litter catcher to grab the stray bits by laying it on their exit path. Works reasonably well. 

7 - Look into pet urine enzymes at your local pet store. You'll be glad you did. 

8 - Next time someone doesn't like the way you're cleaning, hand *them* the mop. Unless that person is employing you, you have no obligation to clean to their standards.

AmItheAsshole,fcy6lni,t1_fcx1den,1578075535.0,"Trauma sucks for everyone. 

It sucks for your aunt because at one point she was a genuine victim, which may have played a part in leading to the victim mentality she currently has. Trauma emotionally stunts you at the age you were traumatised, unless you work through it with a professional.

As someone said, 'if the only tool you have is a hammer, you treat everything as a nail' and unfortunately, the only tool your aunt has that has worked in the past is her victim mentality. 

It sucks for everyone else because of the  ubiquitous boundary violations that are happening. 

- did she have permission to trash the bathroom?  No? Boundary violation. 

- expecting you to fix a problem that she created? Boundary violation. 

- trying to make you feel guilty for not coming to the rescue?  Boundary violation. 

That feeling you feel that feels like anger?  Adrenaline coursing, stomach in knots?  That's your body telling you this. Listen to it. Don't override it. 

It's like a mom telling her kid to 'go hug your uncle John' when they don't want to. It teaches them to override their natural instincts, to ignore their own boundaries, and then when grandpa jones takes it a little too far, little Billy has already learned that you listen to adults no matter how you feel, and bad things happen. 

You are responsible for your own life, and she is responsible for hers. You don't need to justify it.  It's not your job to solve anyone else's problem.  

NTA - just say, I'm sorry but I have my own financial obligations. I really hope you figure it out. Please let me know if there's anything I can do in terms of (support you are willing to give such as helping to tile, etc).

Good for you for standing strong."
