JustNoSO,ffety4y,t3_egjebr,1579865387.0,"Ehh, I'd be pissed off. He knew he was eating old food and drinking alcohol the night before you both planned for him to meet your friends. And you can't catch germs from someone else eating bad food. Unless he's got salmonella or E. coli and he poos, doesn't wash his hands afterwards, then prepares food for you so you swallow his poo. I'm not a doctor, but I've had salmonella before and I'm pretty sure that's the main thing you need to be careful about.

You have got to unlearn this tendency to assume that if you feel upset with something your partner has done, it must be because you're crazy and your feelings are wrong. I get it, I suffered abuse as a kid and I also spent years assuming I could only possibly be upset at my partner / date because I'm still hurting from the past. It took me a long time to unlearn that, and I had to do it very deliberately and consciously.

We need to pay attention to our feelings - they're trying to tell us something. Sometimes that something is that our partner made two very dumb decisions (perhaps deliberately so?) and it caused them to break a promise to us when it was important to us. You feel self-conscious about having been ""the single one"" around your friends for so long, and then you had to feel self-conscious that you were ""the one who invented a boyfriend"" or ""the one with an asshole boyfriend"" who ditches you while everyone else's boyfriend turns up.

He absolutely should have apologised. You are absolutely entitled to feel upset about it. Give yourself more credit, and give your own feelings more credence."

I think, aside from getting to the point quickly, it would also help if you thought about your audience. Why does your audience want to read the story? What's going to be interesting for them? That's going to depend on who your audience is. When you're writing for r/ChoosingBeggars, just stick to the part about a choosing beggar, make it persuasive, and make it interesting.

AskReddit,ff45kff,t1_ff2w5ll,1579556028.0,"I had a partner like this around 11 years ago. I had a long history of child sexual abuse and DV (which he continued) that I was struggling with; he had lost his previous partner to a sudden onset of an illness. There were times he'd respond to my upset - which was usually brought on by him abusing me - with, ""Well how do you think I've felt for the past two years?!""

I ended up leaving him in an angry break-up. He didn't die. We each went on to work through our own shit. He even apologised to me for the abuse a few years later, and he acknowledged that if he wants to have healthy relationships, he's got to not do that kind of thing. He's the only ex I'm still in touch with. I went through several more shitty relationships before kicking myself up the ass to choose someone who's better for me, and now I've been in a happy and peaceful relationship for the past 5 years.

Anyway, my point is, neither of you needs the other one and he won't die if you're not there for him all the time to the point that it breaks you. In fact, it's better for both of you if you each get some independence to look after yourselves."

In these situations we tell ourselves and each other this phrase as a reminder not to take on the client's problems and their procrastination ourselves.

Justnofil,ff2jxmn,t3_eqzse0,1579509537.0,"Actually, I don't blame JNFIL for feeling upset or angry that his 4-year-old grandson drew over his drawing as a prank. Like you said, he's an artist and he takes his drawings seriously. And if you were all in a holiday house then I'm sure you were there for days on end, so I don't think he's out of line for sitting on the floor and drawing something himself while there were children present.

However, there's a difference between the feelings and the behaviour. It's okay to feel upset or angry with a child's behaviour, but it's not okay to yell, scream, or swear at them for it. Grandson needs to not scribble on people's drawings, but JNFIL needs to not yell, scream, or swear at people.

There are two reasons why I think getting some distance from JNFIL is a good idea:

(1) JNFIL's behaviour, as described above. Nobody reacts well to that kind of behaviour, least of all children. You owe it to your daughter to protect her from the fear and hurt she must be experiencing when Granddad behaves like that.

(2) You've had thoughts of punching JNFIL. That probably sounds like it would be satisfying, but it could have some really awful consequences. And that includes for the kids, who would have to witness the escalation in the family from verbal abuse to physical violence. Getting some distance from JNFIL would be a good way to prevent yourself from doing that.

That said, I doubt this is an easy situation for any of you. I really hope you can all figure something out so everyone can feel safe and happy."

videos,fekxb6n,t1_fejdm69,1579209527.0,"Not sure if we can still comment, but I think my point was that people try to make it a mystical thing that other people could not possibly understand, but in fact we're all human beings and we can, or we can try to. And perhaps we've experienced more of life than the person realises.

It's like when a person with depression fancies their own feelings as much deeper or more sophisticated than others', so they tell other people things like, ""You wouldn't understand,"" or, ""You've just had a bad day. This is my whole life!"" Once I also got, ""You're lucky you were sexually abused as a child. There's no explanation for my depression!""

In fact, I've done that myself - imagined I was very special and unique, that I knew things about the world that other people could not possibly know, because of the child sexual abuse. I imagined I was a special kind of sad and it was just who I was, my identity. I can understand why I reached that conclusion because I was very young of course, but as I grew older I realised just how many people had experienced the same or similar or much worse, and even the abuses some of my own school friends had gone through that I'd had no clue about. Now I remind myself not to underestimate people. And although I'm not special or unique anymore, I actually feel much happier because I feel more connected to all the people around me.

Also, for the record, I had many nights in my life when I would cry and think, ""This wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been born a girl."" (And there's a chance I was wrong about that anyway, tbh.)

So anyway, my point was that I think people make this sound a lot harder than it really is. I think we're all human and when we feel something, I think often there's a simpler explanation for it than we realise."

It's actually okay to set boundaries with people who have even the most severe mental illnesses. In fact, I think it's good for the person who has the mental illness and good for the people around them, too, if the people around them set (reasonable and respectful) boundaries with them about what behaviour they will and won't tolerate.

RBNSpouses,fe6qqqf,t1_fe60f45,1578900963.0,"I'm sorry to say it, but you did not respect her boundaries. There are a few times in your original post where you didn't, such as when you continued the conversation for so long after it became apparent she wanted to stop talking, and when you messaged her after it was very clear that she didn't want to talk to you.

Perhaps what you feel confused about is that she tried to ""let you down easy"" by telling you that she cared about you and liked you... but that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you and she wants to cut things off with you. You feel hurt now, but just imagine how hurt you would have felt if she skipped being nice and, without warning, told you she didn't like you and to fuck off. Or if she ghosted you and just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth with no explanation. Or if, when you asked her if it was okay to talk, she had told you she'd rather vomit than ever talk to you again. There are so many more nasty and immature ways she could have gone about this, but instead it sounds like she tried to be very kind and accommodating to your feelings when she broke up with you.

I understood that she was the one who made a call while you were talking to her, not that somebody called her and she picked up. You wanted to talk to her - and you did, for almost an hour - and she didn't want to talk to you and she needed to renew her driver's licence. I'm sorry, but this sounds like she became blunt and obvious after her previous attempts to tell you she didn't want to talk didn't work. Some people might call her behaviour rude, but she would never have had to resort to that behaviour if you had just listened to her and stopped talking when she wanted to stop talking.

Yeah, I also used to make the mistake of blaming my current behaviour, and my current non-attraction to or discomfort around certain men, on my past experiences of men abusing me. I now realise that I was wrong, and all I was doing was dismissing my own present feelings, as though they must be faulty. My feelings of non-attraction or discomfort aren't faulty, and I doubt hers are either. I'm sorry, but this still leads me back to - when she told you she didn't want to be with you, that was what she really felt.

If you still feel angry about how the end of the relationship and the break-up went down, then I'll have to apologise again - it takes two to tango. You played a role in being a part of a relationship that was never going to work out, and a break-up that turned nasty, just like she did. If you get into a pattern of blaming your partners 100% for any problems then you will get into a cycle of unhealthy relationships that leave you feeling unhappy rather than fulfilled. It's hard to do and it takes practice, but you can overcome that by self-reflecting and holding yourself accountable for your own feelings and actions."

I'm also not sure she's unique - I have also, years ago, left the home of a casual partner bawling my eyes out because I was falling for him but he didn't feel the same way and didn't want a relationship with me.

The part where he said ""mean things"" to her stood out to me. He also stated that it ""got ugly"", so I suspect the things he said to / about her were pretty nasty. OP also wrote several times about how much he loves this woman.

I think it's a good idea for OP to ask himself, how much can he really love this woman if he's willing to say nasty things to her just because she rejected him? I suspect that if OP is honest, he'll admit that he doesn't love this woman as much as he thought he did, and I also suspect he doesn't like her all that much as a person, either."
