DMAcademy,ff7unea,t3_errwqh,1579658770.0,"I've been thinking up ways to make dungeons more interesting myself, and I came up with the idea of other adventuring parties filling in some gaps in larger dungeons. This obviously only makes sense is specific settings, but if there's an ongoing expedition into a complex network of caves or a treasure hunt in a recently re-discovered tomb, you could easily work them in there, and then they could serve multiple purposes;

A, friendly NPCs will make a dangerous location seem less terrifying. Friendlies can pop up in some areas and come to the rescue of your players if things go sideways, likewise if *they* run into trouble, there's a quest hook for your party to jump in and show the baddies what-for.

B, rivals. Imagine thinking your way through a puzzle or discovering a hidden room that contains an ornate chest. Now imagine opening that chest and finding nothing but a note containing a message something to the tune of ""ya snooze ya loose!"". Rival parties might not be hostile, but they offer a sense of urgency and competition to a dungeon. Serves to keep things moving as they players realize that if they don't reach their goals soon, someone else is getting all that gold and glory (and XP).

C, Shops. If your dungeon is HUGE, it might make sense for merchants to take advantage of areas already cleared by adventurers and set up shop to offer mercenaries essentials or a place to rest. Shops set up at the entrance will probably be safest and best supplied, but something as simple as a humble pit stop can add some longevity to your adventure, and skip backtracking back to town.

D, Flavor. You follow some tracks into the next chamber and a wave of disappointment descends as you realize this room has probably been looted already. Then you notice the discarded helmet in the corner and, wait, that looks familiar. Didn't we see that friendly dwarf and his friends a few floors up? What happened to them? Also whats all this red stuff on the fl- oh no...

Showing how other parties interact with your dungeon can be fun, interesting, or foreboding. Maybe friendly NPCs get caught in a trap and your own party will stop to mourn. Maybe you arrive in the boss's room and se him picking the bones of your rival out of his teeth, and you chuckle a bi as you ready for battle. Maybe you bump into the same faces a few times, and you stop to chat about each other's progress. Really, you can do anything with this concept, and having any NPC's that you can interact with can make a long-haul adventure less of a slog."

DMAcademy,ff3nn9j,t3_erb7ff,1579544925.0,"Not sure if this fits your game, but I had an idea with killing off my own warlock character when I was considering switching PCs (I eventually decided against it but it may happen at some point). My patron is a Great Old One, of whom my Warlock really doesn't know anything about and doesn't really understand the terms of his pact, at most he gets vague dreams that suggest what he should do on occasion, but mostly he acts how he sees fit and uses his powers to benefit himself only (he used to be a pirate, so he's rather greedy). I decided if my character was ever to die, I'd simply have my patron straight-up kill my character after deciding he was of no use. I imagined this would happen by my character being lured towards the ocean through some means, likely a vision, then a massive tentacle would emerge from the water and drag my PC kicking and screaming into the depths. His gear would wash up on the beach and he'd never be seen again, consumed by the dark forces he'd failed to please.

StarWars,ff3dczq,t1_ff3a8sg,1579538855.0,"Thanks! Yeah, not to mention if Finn had been given a larger role, we'd also get much better opportunity for character moments from Phasma, who would be trying holding things together and putting down deserters. Same goes for Hux, who we saw going against Kylo in the last film for his own purposes, but they could have expanded upon this if his goals had been fleshed out a little more."
StarWars,ff38z3a,t3_erc0ua,1579536505.0,"Star Wars needs its cannon fodder, and Stormtroopers have always been there to fill that role. But you do make a good point. Finn deserting the First Order made an interesting statement about the nature of the current generation of Stormtroopers, and the movies do very little with the concept since most troopers are still essentially mindless drones.

An excellent story point they could have went with is Finn's desertion setting off a wave of most deserters. Soldiers trained from childhood suddenly facing questions about their own existence and personal choice. Maybe some of them realize they regret the things they've done for the First Order, maybe some suddenly refuse orders they find immoral. Maybe Finn or Rey are arrested at one point and a few Stormtroopers are oddly on the fence about executing these people that give them a sense of... hope? Maybe the First Order is not defeated by an enormous Rebel Fleet that appears from nowhere at the last minute, but by in-fighting as officers like General Hux begin to disagree about their role in the galaxy and whether the Order is actually a just organization. Maybe the spark of hope is all that was necessary for the collapse of an Order built on hatred and fear. Maybe Finn's story arc would have been significant in the grand scheme of things and he would have actually had a role in the last two movies.

StarWars,ff37gqa,t3_er7zl2,1579535504.0,"The separatists leaders were dead, but there were probably millions of people still living on separatist-loyal worlds who weren't immediately notified about the end of the war. I'd imagine they were rather confused when they'd heard news that the Jedi order had been wiped out following a failed coup. Maybe some were even hopeful about it initially, with the Jedi gone the Republic may have been weakened to a point where the CIS could bounce back.

However, this hope was probably over with within a week, when the newly formed Empire suddenly claimed control over worlds that had rebelled against the Republic for years. There's actually a lot of potential there for a novel about these events from an ex-separatist's point of view."

DMAcademy,ff35pyd,t1_ff2go9j,1579534307.0,"I've toyed with this idea as well, though I've never implemented it in a game. I like the idea of a magic item that poses serious risk when used, but if the consequences are the potential to die immediately, I don't think most players would go for it (and the positive results could be game-breaking anyways). Rather than the Skull card summoning an Avatar of Death, I'd have it summon a powerful undead enemy scaled a few CR's above what the party would face at their level. The Gem card would offer only 2,000 gp rather than 50,000. Any curses are temporary, any great boons are finite, and for balance any cards that affect XP does so to the whole party."
DMAcademy,ff340i0,t3_erb09u,1579533111.0,"Don't know why this is getting downvoted since it's a good question.

I'd say let your player try it for now, just make sure you're familiar with all of an Artificer's abilities so you can be prepared to counter things if they make themselves OP. If that rifle proves game-breaking later and he's doing far more damage then the rest of the party, that's when you reign it in by limiting his abilities somewhat. Maybe have the rifle damaged in combat so it functions sub-optimally (give it a -2 to hit when is disrepair, or a -1 damage, nothing too extreme), or keep your party in a scenario that makes it difficult to create new ammo, so that your Artificer will want to only use it sparingly.

Most important, though, is make sure your player knows your concerns before you begin playing and that you'll only start limiting them if you feel it's necessary. They may even enjoy the extra challenge of working with those constraints if they feel the damage output is worth it."

Maybe it's just a tavern they can live above and use to relax in during adventurers, or maybe it's a well-kept manor house on the edge of town. If they're VERY rich, and also have alot of enemies, they can use that money to build a fortress.

If you DON'T care to keep your party in one place, have them spend that coin on a ship instead, gives them a mobile base that can ferry them between adventures. This also gives them the opportunity to hire a crew. Having skilled NPC companions is great for providing backup on difficult adventures, and they may even become fond of their crew members, giving more opportunities for roleplay."

DMAcademy,fdw9xoa,t3_en7o1l,1578756589.0,"Not every room has to have something in it, just be sure that you don't have an excess of empty rooms. If you don't have an encounter planned for a room, you should usually include at the least some unimportant objects to convey the room's original purpose. Broken furniture implies this room was sleeping quarters, empty weapon racks implies a barracks. There's an old rug with a family crest here, history roll to learn some information about the original inhabitants. 

Something fun you can include in some dungeons is the presence of other adventurers. If  you want to convey early on that this place is *dangerous*, have the party stumble upon an armor clad skeleton caught in a trap that had already been activated. Have some rooms with their locks already picked, chests already looted, then have the party find the remains of the theif two floors down (his loot bag may or may not be present).

Some rooms may be left entirely empty with no obvious purpose, some dungeons need a bit of padding out. The fun of exploring is you don't always know what you'll find, and sometimes it's a relief not to find anything at all if you're in an especially dangerous dungeon. Parties like mapping out the entire dungeon, so even finding an empty room will still have a certain amount of satisfaction towards achieving that goal. Just don't do too many of these or exploration will feel like a chore. Just a quick ""there's nothing in this room, let's move on!"" is all you need on occasion."

DMAcademy,ff7unea,t3_errwqh,1579658770.0,"I've been thinking up ways to make dungeons more interesting myself, and I came up with the idea of other adventuring parties filling in some gaps in larger dungeons. This obviously only makes sense is specific settings, but if there's an ongoing expedition into a complex network of caves or a treasure hunt in a recently re-discovered tomb, you could easily work them in there, and then they could serve multiple purposes;

A, friendly NPCs will make a dangerous location seem less terrifying. Friendlies can pop up in some areas and come to the rescue of your players if things go sideways, likewise if *they* run into trouble, there's a quest hook for your party to jump in and show the baddies what-for.

B, rivals. Imagine thinking your way through a puzzle or discovering a hidden room that contains an ornate chest. Now imagine opening that chest and finding nothing but a note containing a message something to the tune of ""ya snooze ya loose!"". Rival parties might not be hostile, but they offer a sense of urgency and competition to a dungeon. Serves to keep things moving as they players realize that if they don't reach their goals soon, someone else is getting all that gold and glory (and XP).

C, Shops. If your dungeon is HUGE, it might make sense for merchants to take advantage of areas already cleared by adventurers and set up shop to offer mercenaries essentials or a place to rest. Shops set up at the entrance will probably be safest and best supplied, but something as simple as a humble pit stop can add some longevity to your adventure, and skip backtracking back to town.

D, Flavor. You follow some tracks into the next chamber and a wave of disappointment descends as you realize this room has probably been looted already. Then you notice the discarded helmet in the corner and, wait, that looks familiar. Didn't we see that friendly dwarf and his friends a few floors up? What happened to them? Also whats all this red stuff on the fl- oh no...

Showing how other parties interact with your dungeon can be fun, interesting, or foreboding. Maybe friendly NPCs get caught in a trap and your own party will stop to mourn. Maybe you arrive in the boss's room and se him picking the bones of your rival out of his teeth, and you chuckle a bi as you ready for battle. Maybe you bump into the same faces a few times, and you stop to chat about each other's progress. Really, you can do anything with this concept, and having any NPC's that you can interact with can make a long-haul adventure less of a slog."

DMAcademy,ff3nn9j,t3_erb7ff,1579544925.0,"Not sure if this fits your game, but I had an idea with killing off my own warlock character when I was considering switching PCs (I eventually decided against it but it may happen at some point). My patron is a Great Old One, of whom my Warlock really doesn't know anything about and doesn't really understand the terms of his pact, at most he gets vague dreams that suggest what he should do on occasion, but mostly he acts how he sees fit and uses his powers to benefit himself only (he used to be a pirate, so he's rather greedy). I decided if my character was ever to die, I'd simply have my patron straight-up kill my character after deciding he was of no use. I imagined this would happen by my character being lured towards the ocean through some means, likely a vision, then a massive tentacle would emerge from the water and drag my PC kicking and screaming into the depths. His gear would wash up on the beach and he'd never be seen again, consumed by the dark forces he'd failed to please.

StarWars,ff38z3a,t3_erc0ua,1579536505.0,"Star Wars needs its cannon fodder, and Stormtroopers have always been there to fill that role. But you do make a good point. Finn deserting the First Order made an interesting statement about the nature of the current generation of Stormtroopers, and the movies do very little with the concept since most troopers are still essentially mindless drones.

An excellent story point they could have went with is Finn's desertion setting off a wave of most deserters. Soldiers trained from childhood suddenly facing questions about their own existence and personal choice. Maybe some of them realize they regret the things they've done for the First Order, maybe some suddenly refuse orders they find immoral. Maybe Finn or Rey are arrested at one point and a few Stormtroopers are oddly on the fence about executing these people that give them a sense of... hope? Maybe the First Order is not defeated by an enormous Rebel Fleet that appears from nowhere at the last minute, but by in-fighting as officers like General Hux begin to disagree about their role in the galaxy and whether the Order is actually a just organization. Maybe the spark of hope is all that was necessary for the collapse of an Order built on hatred and fear. Maybe Finn's story arc would have been significant in the grand scheme of things and he would have actually had a role in the last two movies.

Maybe some were even hopeful about it initially, with the Jedi gone the Republic may have been weakened to a point where the CIS could bounce back.

I like the idea of a magic item that poses serious risk when used, but if the consequences are the potential to die immediately, I don't think most players would go for it (and the positive results could be game-breaking anyways). Rather than the Skull card summoning an Avatar of Death, I'd have it summon a powerful undead enemy scaled a few CR's above what the party would face at their level. The Gem card would offer only 2,000 gp rather than 50,000. Any curses are temporary, any great boons are finite, and for balance any cards that affect XP does so to the whole party."
DMAcademy,ff340i0,t3_erb09u,1579533111.0,"Don't know why this is getting downvoted since it's a good question.

I'd say let your player try it for now, just make sure you're familiar with all of an Artificer's abilities so you can be prepared to counter things if they make themselves OP. If that rifle proves game-breaking later and he's doing far more damage then the rest of the party, that's when you reign it in by limiting his abilities somewhat. Maybe have the rifle damaged in combat so it functions sub-optimally (give it a -2 to hit when is disrepair, or a -1 damage, nothing too extreme), or keep your party in a scenario that makes it difficult to create new ammo, so that your Artificer will want to only use it sparingly.

Most important, though, is make sure your player knows your concerns before you begin playing and that you'll only start limiting them if you feel it's necessary. They may even enjoy the extra challenge of working with those constraints if they feel the damage output is worth it."

Broken furniture implies this room was sleeping quarters, empty weapon racks implies a barracks. There's an old rug with a family crest here, history roll to learn some information about the original inhabitants. 

Something fun you can include in some dungeons is the presence of other adventurers. If  you want to convey early on that this place is *dangerous*, have the party stumble upon an armor clad skeleton caught in a trap that had already been activated. Have some rooms with their locks already picked, chests already looted, then have the party find the remains of the theif two floors down (his loot bag may or may not be present).

Some rooms may be left entirely empty with no obvious purpose, some dungeons need a bit of padding out. The fun of exploring is you don't always know what you'll find, and sometimes it's a relief not to find anything at all if you're in an especially dangerous dungeon. Parties like mapping out the entire dungeon, so even finding an empty room will still have a certain amount of satisfaction towards achieving that goal.
