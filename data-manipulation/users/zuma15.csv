baseball,ffzh81u,t1_ffxxdss,1580378984.0,"Well they have zero chance of retaining either in 2 years given Arenado's opt-out.  And that opt-out is why it doesn't make sense for the Cubs.  Either Arenado keeps putting up MVP-level numbers and leaves in 2 years, or he doesn't and the Cubs are stuck paying him over $30 mil/year for 5 additional years for who-knows-what level of performance."

- There have been rumors about the buzzers for while now 
- The Astros' cheating has been proven definitively.  Whether they moved on from banging trash cans to some sort of electronic device remains to be seen
- Altuve's suspicious behavior on his walk-off home run is wholly consistent with wearing a buzzer.
