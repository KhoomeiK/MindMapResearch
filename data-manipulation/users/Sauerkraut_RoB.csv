BikiniBottomTwitter,feo1q4y,t1_fen7u59,1579293971.0,"I hear the school teaches you how to learn thing for every level of school. Primary to secondary to college, but I always just wonder why they can't just teach someone how to learn with useful things. Does a kid NEED to know 'to kill a mockingbird'? Not really.

When they are homeless because they were never taught any real skills, those books won't help them. I value books and academics, but lets be realistic here. People need real skills, and nowadays, waiting until you are in your mid twenties out of college to start getting them is not helping

Edit: why are you booing me? I'm right!"
BikiniBottomTwitter,fen4shy,t1_femyz5t,1579276965.0,"Exactly. Wouldn't it be nice if school would instead give you skills instead of academic knowledge? With our current system, you might not get anything from school"
BikiniBottomTwitter,fen181n,t1_femq203,1579274694.0,"I see what you're saying, but next to no one uses the quadratic formula on a daily basis, or synthetic division. Those are pretty basic math concepts that are taught to pretty much everyone in the US, but they don't help much.

I think what most people's compaint is that public school doesn't feel like it really gives them much. They do those google searches and out poo a few good paying jobs that they don't know how to do, or don't have the required peice of paper.

A job is stabilization in your life. Without a paying job, with some promise of helping you pay the bills, people feel lost. The problem, I beleive, that we have now is that people are getting their first real gig late in life. 22 and onward. Hell, college is becoming hard to graduate in 4 years, I was 25 when I got my EE degree.

People keep talking about tacking on more education, which is rediculous. This country doesnt need people joining the workforce in their thirties. Lets make use of the education we do have. Rather than twelve years of math, teach kids the basics, then have them learn a skill. Trade, academic, something to make a high school diploma worth something. That gives them worth, something they know. Go look at r/2me4meirl if you don't think people need worth these days. Lets let people actually become independent at 18. Most of human history thrived on apprenticeships, and teaching everyone academia obviously isn't working."
