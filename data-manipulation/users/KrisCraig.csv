**Q. Does Birdie comply with Twitter's rules?**

Yes, Birdie is 100%-compliant.  Automated retweets like this are explicitly permitted in the API rules.  Furthermore, the app distributes larger sets of tweets over time so as not to overload or spam the network.

While Twitter and other social media sites do make combating spam bots a priority, Birdie is not such a bot (and no, I'm not from Russia, either).  Birdie is designed to be used by real Twitter users with active accounts; people who would otherwise be inclined to retweet all of Bernie's tweets, anyway, if it were sufficiently convenient.  

This project does *not* welcome the use of dedicated bot accounts like those designed to manipulate Twitter's algorithms.  This is about making Bernie's tweets visible to your friends and family, exposing them to what he has to say on the issues despite the pervailing media blackout.  The hope is that at least some of them will, in turn, follow Bernie on Twitter, thereby increasing his Twitter reach.

This type of use-case is permitted, even on larger deployment scales.  The app does *not* auto-like tweets or do anything else that violates Twitter's API rules or ToS.

Worst-case scenario, if Twitter were to change their rules so this is no longer allowed, they would simply strip the app's permissions so it can no longer tweet.  The actual person using the app would be otherwise unaffected (so long as they're real and not just a dedicated spambot account, of course).  But again, I need to stress that Birdie is 100% compliant with Twitter's rules.  I was very careful about this.

**Q. Why not just make it have the user choose whether to retweet each tweet?**

There are already apps out there that can be used to do that.  Birdie is designed for exposing *all* of Bernie's recent tweets to your followers, in the hopes that at least some of them will then like what they see and follow him as a result.

There are already volunteers out there doing this manually throughout the day.  The whole point behind Birdie is to automate this process, freeing up those volunteers to work on other things, while also opening the door for people who otherwise wouldn't have time to volunteer to easily make a difference.

**Q. I installed the app, but if I leave it in the background for more than a few minutes, it stops running until I open it again.  What gives?**

Some phone manufacturers use a custom version of Android that prevents any apps not made by a ""trusted"" source like Google from running in the background for more than a few minutes.  They do this by suspending or terminating all of an app's scheduled background alarms and jobs.

This prevents Birdie from periodically executing its background tasks as intended.  Unfortunately, on some devices (like my fucking TracFone), there is simply no way to turn this behavior off and no way to get around it as an app developer.

So if this happens to you, here's a simple and only mildly inconvenient workaround:  Two or three times a day, open Birdie on your phone, wait for it to load, then hit your phone's home button to go back.  That will force the app back into the foreground and the operating system will stop blocking it from working.

**Q. When can we expect an iPhone version of Birdie?**

StillSandersForPres,ffbjwdj,t1_ffbis00,1579768794.0,"> I’m talking about twitter’s algorithm, not your coding. You do realize combating spam & manipulation is their #1 priority (as it is for Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram or any UGC site as well).

Condescension aside, yes I am aware of this.  I've been a software engineer for over 25 years and I don't go into a project like this without knowing what I'm doing.

That said, as I have already repeatedly pointed out, this app does not fall under Twitter's definition of spam or manipulation.  The number of users is irrelevant because that only matters if we're doing something we don't want Twitter to notice, which again does not apply to this situation as everything we're doing is above-board.

> Your tests are too small scale to really know. Add 100k users (especially new accounts) all retweeting in blocks at the same time, and you’ll surely be reviewed by their spam teams

At the risk of sounding like a broken record here, I'm not interested in evading their spam teams/algos.  Any app that generates sufficient traffic is going to be reviewed for compliance.  The rules do not state that automated retweeting is only allowed on small scales.

Also, it should be pointed out that the retweets come out in blocks of 3 every 15 minutes, which is orders of magnitude below the API per-user speed limit.  Furthermore, each app runs on its own timetable; i.e. they're not all retweeting in sync.  The load is distributed so as not to spam the network, even with 100K+ users.

> It would be a shame for users accounts to be banned or Sander’s tweets to be auto-filtered.

It would also be a shame if the app evolved into a malevolent superintelligence bent on the extermination of the human race.  Both scenarios have about an equal chance of happening here.

> You want things to be as natural as possible with as much user control & variation as possible.

Again, you're making it sound like we want to hide what we're doing, but that's bullshit.  This app complies entirely with Twitter's rules.  If they did have any questions or concerns about it, my contact information is readily available.

I appreciate your concerns, but they're unfounded for the reasons I've stated."

**This app does not do that.**

> Automated Retweets: Provided you comply with all other rules, you may Retweet or Quote Tweet in an automated manner

Which the app does, in full compiance with the rules.  I was very careful about this.  While fully automated retweeting *can* be abuse/spam, it is not inherently so, as the rules clearly state.

> mass retweeting campaigns will be seen as trying to manipulate their algorithm

Based on what, exactly?  People already mass-organize retweets to boost their candidates' Twitter reach all the time and Twitter has never stood in the way.  Furthermore, each Twitter user is choosing to install the app so they can share all of Bernie's tweets with their friends and family, a legitimate use-case.

> it will be very easy to spot & punish because you have no randomness built-in.

Randomness would only be necessary if we were trying to evade Twitter's rules enforcement.  Since we are not doing anything that violates the rules, why would we want to do that?

You seem to be making a lot of assumptions about how Twitter implements their API rules which are not consistent with my many years of experience working with it.  Back in 2016, I had built a similar Windows app for this and they never gave me any trouble.

**TL;DR: This app is 100%-compliant with Twitter's API ToS.  The rules you yourself just quoted substantiate this rather clearly.**"
StillSandersForPres,ffbhauu,t1_ffb61g0,1579765273.0,"> Better to prompt the user to decide whether to retweet or not. Also better to include your own tweet with it.

Why, exactly?  **The Twitter API Terms of Service allow for automated retweets and it's hardly a new thing.**

This is a volunteer app installed by people who want to help expand Bernie's Twitter reach and, subsequently, boost voter turnout in his favor.  **An app that runs in the background on their phone makes perfect sense, actually.**  Do you really think said volunteer wants to be spammed with ""Retweet this!"" prompts throughout the day when it can just be automatic?

If you're just looking to retweet individual tweets you like and add your own commentary, you can already do that with any standard Twitter app or through the Twitter website, itself.  That's not what this app is for.

Sorry, but a person's progressivism is not defined by adherence to an arbitrary list of ""good"" and ""bad"" media sources.  In today's landscape, that's just the height of stupidity.

Given the present media blackout, we can't afford to be picky about only using sources we like or whose editorial opinions we agree with.  Not when you have outlets like CNN focused on jamming a contrived narrative down our throats and refusing to report on stories like this.

So if you don't like the source, there are two things you can do about it:

1\. Fact-check the article and point out any incongruities you find. 

2\. Find a source more to your liking and post a link to it.

Furthermore, while The Federalist is definitely far-right in terms of political alignment and it shows in their editorials, they also produce articles that appear to be well-researched and often cover topics like this that mainstream outlets habitually ignore because they go against the neoliberal establishment.  So if they occasionally produce a piece that's worth posting here, I'm going to post it.  

And if you think this is what makes a person progressive or not, then you clearly don't understand what it means to be progressive.  Fighting for things like M4A is what makes you a progressive.
