engineering,ffl0jms,t3_eu13cp,1580032568.0,"Well, the summary of the report is pretty damning for Boeing.

>Shortly after the accident, Boeing issued a bulletin to
all 737 operators and announced that it “will warn crews about fundamentals
like flying the aircraft, monitoring airspeed, [and] monitoring altitude”
(Learmount, 2009).
The only defense against a designed-in single-failure path, in other words, are
the pilots who are warned to mistrust their machine and to stare at it harder.
Such a reminder, oriented only at the human operator in the system, is hardly
credible after three decades of in-depth research into automated airliner flying
and the subtle and pervasive ways in which automation on the flight deck (and
particularly its subtle failure) affects human performance (e.g. Wiener & Curry,
1980, Sarter et al., 1997).

 For flight crews of Boeing 737’s, like the crew of
TK1951, there is no sufficient training, no written guidance or documentation,
and no likelihood of line experience that would insulate them from the kind of
automation surprise that happened near Amsterdam on the 25th of February."
