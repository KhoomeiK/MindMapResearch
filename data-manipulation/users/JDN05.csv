However, I can’t find anything suggesting they were bred to have so much wool that it affected their well-being. (I didn’t look for very long though.) Assuming they are sheared once a year (I think), they don’t exactly suffer. It is true that we have bred sheep so that they require shearing, but the fact that they cannot roam wild without human care due to our breeding habits is no more cruel than the domestication of all animals, or the fact that we take animals from the wild, put them in zoos, and force them to rely on us for food."

memes,fczeq5b,t3_ejmvd2,1578099547.0,"Actually, overpopulation is not an actually pressing problem. There’s lots of spare land to be converted into living space and farmland for crops. Additionally, the population increase over the past century or so isn’t going to continue into the future indefinitely. Before the 1800s, the population was increasing slowly because, on average, only two out of the several children born would survive until adulthood, pretty much replacing their parents in terms of the mostly stable population. After the Industrial Revolution, people were starting to have more than two children surviving to adulthood, drastically increasing the amount of people by each generation. Now, with more people being educated on prevention methods and whatnot, people start having only two children, which brings back the old balance. The United Nations predicted 20 years ago that the population would stabilize around 2200 at ~11 billion. That’s about a 50% increase from now to then, which is about the same as from the late 80s/early 90s to now. If the population increases by half in forty years and is projected to increase by half again in 180, then that means the rate of growth is decreasing.

AskReddit,fcw2dn4,t3_eixc75,1578015550.0,"I tried this new website my friend recommended to me. Turns out, it was full of antisocial shut-ins who had no life. Tried to have a conversation with someone and they kept cracking jokes and being a smart-aleck. They weren’t serious about a relationship at all, they just made an account for entertainment purposes. I tried to talk to several more people, and EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM was more interested in memes or funny animal gifs and whatnot. The only thing I liked was that the creators of this dating site have set up a way for you to join groups to find people with similar interests, which is an excellent design idea, but people have abused this power by making groups for random things that no sane person would ever list as an attribute they wish for their partner to possess. I’m very disappointed with this site. It’s as if I’m the only one here who actually uses it as a dating tool. I hope you all have better luck in your online dating experiences, but if you want to start, definitely don’t use the site I used, because it’s the worst dating website I have ever encountered.
