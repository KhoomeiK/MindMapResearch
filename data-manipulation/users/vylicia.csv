violinist,fgirr9l,t1_fgikpe0,1580829448.0,"Honestly, the bashing of her playing and sound production just sounds catty. It's not great, but why be nasty idk. I don't even really disagree with you on those, but like... this attitude always comes across as basically to never play ever if you aren't a super advanced violinist. And *definitely* do not step outside the norm. No other instruments seem to have this problem as severely. 


However I can't imagine why she would take a pic like that, nvm post it though. Her playing posture on ig looks nothing like that. Just... Why. It looks like a stock photo."

news,fgill60,t1_fgif8zj,1580825121.0,Ok yeah tbh that was even loonier than I expected. And I did in fact expect loony.
