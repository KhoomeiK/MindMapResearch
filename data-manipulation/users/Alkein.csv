>Discord started selling games and is trying to be steam now.

They've kinda backed off from that recently from what I've seen as they realised it's not gonna go anywhere so it's just there as a way to manage your game libraries if you want (eliminating the need to open up and navigate your steam library).

>I don't take part in the forum part of steam and discord has nothing like that from my understanding so the whole community tab issue feels incredibly nitpicky.

Okay so then why are you discussing what these services provide to communities if you ignore the community aspects of them. No one cares about your opinion on these services if you only use it to call your one buddy each night when you game. 

>Steam is the definition of a lightweight program where everything is on screen where you need it. That's the whole point of the overlay.

It's not *that* lightweight, as if I cared about that though. I have steam running in the background all the time anyways. Same as I have discord running is the background as well. Same as I had the preferred voice application, usually Skype and to a lesser degree, vent or teamspeak running in the background back in the day. 

>Their streaming is infinitely better then discords, and steam allows friends on other computers to join local multiplayer games through their streaming services.

Haven't tried screen sharing or streaming a game but their play together is atrocious connection wise.

>Discord was a replacement for ventrilo and teamspeak, not a community service. Now steam has made it redundant. You're choosing to an extra program on top of every game you play and complaining about wanting a lightweight product.

Discord was a replacement for those, but you see unlike a stupid business that would just repackage the same product and launch it out there to die, they iterated on it and instead of communities needing to host their own website with community forums like almost every large teamspeak community server had back then, and now it's all in one spot. Forums while still having a purpose aren't the go to mode of communication anymore either, discord style chat feeds are more popular. Discord also took a ton of inspiration (pretty much ripping off) from Slack. 

What's wrong with choosing an extra program to use for voice, seeing as I have much more control over a discord server, a much more fluent UI, and I don't have to worry about steam chats erases old messages, navigating between multiple windows for slightly different functions. Yeah I'll take that over steams half-assed, disjointed, fractured implementation that was pushed out the door so they could try to get a piece of the Skype pie before discord snatched up all the people looking for something better.

That's before getting into importing custom emoji, gifs, the audit log, custom roles, mute/deafen, individual volume control, kicking, banning, locked channels, channels with capacities, channel folders. Idk man sounds a lot to me like discord is a community service and fits that niche pretty well, so it's understandable why the *majority of the gaming community* and many other art/tabletop/music/etc... Communities have all adopted discord as a central place for all their discussions.

>What the fuck?

Sounds like you hardly take advantage of any features of either and are talking out your ass so yeah I guess I'll ask you the same thing, what the fuck?"
mountandblade,fg11512,t1_fg0yojq,1580418873.0,"Okay from what I understand and how I've used steam. They introduced the discord-lite update awhile back which added some new things in addition to some features they already had (Groups, friends, Community page, discussions) 

So before I get into the new friends tab, let me go over stuff that appears to be redundant.

Groups: you have steam groups, you can join these, use their tags in some games, or join their group chat. 

How is it redundant? Well in the friends tab you can start a chat group, which from then on functions like a steam group group-chat. Why is the group's now split so I have my chat/friends groups in friend tab, with my ""active"" steam community group chats that I've joined showing up there as well. The posts to a steam group aren't sorted into specific chat channels as far as I know (although I think there is chat channels in steam now) but your group page has its own seperate page. It has its own interface through the steam page, not the friends list, idk if they moved group controls out of the steam window either. It's all so broken and disjointed, I haven't even mentioned how not just being split between the steam window and the friends tab, but doing anything ""community"" wise on steam will have you constantly switching between the tabs at the top of the steam client as well. From the community tab to the profile tab to the store tab with tons of constant refreshing of the steam window, and certain parts needing to open in their own small window like the friends tab opening seperate from the steam window, and then chats opening seperate from that.


I'm sorry I want a lightweight program where everything is on one screen where I need it. My chat feed is one scrollable channel, and anything else can be sorted into specific channels which swap out one portion of my window with new info instead of redirecting me to a new page in the client and opening up a chat window. Everything is easily accessible and settings are quickly changed with either 1 right or left click depending on which element you click on. There's Mod audit logs, roles with specific restrictions, streamer mode. And if I ever want to check a new community within half a second I can just swap to their discord and see what's up every channel with each type of newsfeed they have. Sorted into folders. Instead of checking what's going on in the chat, then opening up the steam group page to see what's new there. 

And I mean, I know steam has livestreaming but I don't think it has screen sharing options anywhere close to discords. 


Steam has a long way to go to offer the same ease of use as discord. And that's all on-top of discord adopting pretty much any Skype user who's interests overlapped with gaming. The adoption rate is way higher and the features are better and improving faster than steams glacial pace for improvements that aren't a new looking storefront for the next season's big sale."

gameofthrones,fg0s8h0,t1_fg081a7,1580414001.0,Aiming a bow is historically consistent tho. People back then weren't stupid and knew how to shoot a bow and aim it. Volleys are just one effective way of using them in combat.
gameofthrones,fg0s51i,t1_fg04v65,1580413949.0,"There was no ""one way only"" that anything was used in medieval warfare. It's some of the grityiest fighting there is. Long sweaty battles battering eachothers armor, up close and personal as bodies pile up around you. People resorted to all sorts of methods that seem strange as hell to a modern day person. Go tell someone about the mordhau stance where a combatant would hold their sword with the blade and slam the hilt into the opponents helmet because it was more efficient than sliding your sword off them every swing and doing nothing more than jostling them around.

Now with archers sure you'd have a bunch in the back shooting volleys, but then both sides clash and the battle starts to get more hectic, remember these ain't guns people don't die left and right, and it's not like movies where you just slash through people like your cutting through spiderwebs. At this point it's safer to pick targets, move to a better location if possible until you are out of arrows what have you. Or if defending a castle yes they can shoot volleys off or over the walls, but if you want to prevent people from getting closer or climbing ladders or manning a battering ram you'd be picking targets and not volleying. 

And if we are talking about an arrow being used on a leader, yeah your right, but for the wrong reasons. It's. It because it's useless against them for some arbitrary reason. The generals, lords, and all that were regular people too just like us. The reason they wouldn't get sniped by a stray arrow is because it was a big fucking deal if you killed a lord. You'd probably be locked up, tortured, or executed. The Lord's were off limits for normal solidiers. They got to stroll through the battle and pick their fights looking for the other lord to fight him. Sure you'd have some people who do break that convention trying to make a name for themselves or what not, but people knew their position many soliders on both sides would stop their fights (which were slow and drawn out anyways cause armor) to watch lords fight."

And also how if something goes wrong in a car, it's not as dangerous cause you can at least try to pull over and stop. Your on the ground already and there's ways you can try to safely handle that. But if something goes wrong up in the air you don't want the computer doing something that could exacerbate the issue (maybe by following the wrong procedure because the sensors detected whatever but the real cause was something else) before you have a chance to correct it.

I doubt boogie mopes into his bedroom cries about how bad his life is and then slams back 2 pizzas hoping to have a heart attack in his sleep. That might be approaching self harm levels.

""What?? You close at 6;00 and my slow ass didn't get here until 5:59 and there's no humanly possible way I could both do my shopping and go through checkout before the next minute rolls over. And who knows it could even be 10 seconds to 6 so for all intents and purposes actually 6 but unless your showing me a watch that displays seconds I don't wanna hear it. I want to speak to your manager because it's preposterous that you cant fix my self-made problem of arriving too late like I'm some sort of adult toddler who needs to be shown what a grown adult acts like.

Tanked my mmr/Elo back in seasons 2-4 just going to the bottom of bronze and stopping playing ranked. Now every single season, I place high bronze and just get burnt out on the game before I can get back into gold, few times now I've made it to silver 1 but for some reason drop the game in the last few months of the season drop the game. So it's been a long climb out of MMR hell but last season I placed in silver so I'm making progress."

They all just do some stupid janky spin flourish when the swing making it extremely annoying to predict where they will swing, or the speed of it. And it's always the same thing too, so they wind their arm back slightly and your like oooh I'm ready to clash swords, and follow up a cool parry with an attack. Buy everytime they do that stupid flourish, my block carries through and taps them interrupting their stupid spin moves and then they try it all over again."

physicsgifs,fe4i81w,t1_fe43j2m,1578859564.0,"If I'm remembering right it's like how if you fell from really high up into water and landed flat it would really hurt, but land like a pencil tip first and you can kind of cut through. Cause the way water compresses and the surface area of you compressing it. 

With only water your just pushing water into more water and landing flat makes it harder for the water to move around you and allow you to 'fall' into it so the water takes the easier route instead of squeezing into more water and is launched into the air around you making a big splash, whereas landing in a pencil dive the water can move up around your body and close up around you with a little splash. 

And with the cornstarch in there it produces a much more noticeable effect because now all the cornstarch particles slam into eachother and push the water out of the way so the part your compressing now also reverts to a more solid form as it's being squeezed together."
