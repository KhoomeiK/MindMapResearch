EDC,fflb418,t1_ffjmbrn,1580037393.0,What kind of necklace is that? Silver Sterling? I'm interested in buying one too with St. Andrew
RayDonovan,ff8mop1,t1_ff4jhuy,1579686180.0,"Most of them, yes. But I don't think the flashback when Jim rapes Bridget was too."
RayDonovan,ff2iwpu,t1_ff2g62y,1579508153.0,"He asks how Ray knows Jim is the father,not the viewer. Ray can't see the flashbacks when Bridget shows Jim the pregnancy test :)))."
RayDonovan,fdjt7sg,t1_fdjrg40,1578486654.0,"Maybe, but I don't think the screenwriter would use exactly the villain's name from season 1 to confuse us this way. Since the first episode Jim Sullivan was introduced, I assumed he's related to James Wood's character."
RayDonovan,fdjn16x,t3_eljqcl,1578478827.0,Probably they're brothers. I doubt there are more Sullivan families in Boston related to the Donovans.
getdisciplined,fd7vro0,t1_fd6tt90,1578210888.0,"Hello and thank you for your questions.
1.First, I want to say that my breakfast consist of an instant coffee, a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly, cereals with yogurt and a banana. Fast and easy. Or sometimes smth I just grab from the fridge. Maybe a protein bar.

2.Regarding my homework, usually I have easy projects that I finish quite fast. But when it's the case for more, I extend that time to maybe two hours. As you can see, between h.w. and dinner I have exactly two hours. This is my routine during working days. In the weekend I work more to my projects and homeworks.

3. About my workout, well, I'm already a fit guy, going around 13% bodyfat and 75-77kg. I still have to work on my abs. I've been going to gym for two years now with no more than a month break when it was the case. Before going to gym, I used to do calisthenics and the whole base of my body is based around that. I could say that my goals for now is to bulk up. I'm going to gym 5-6 times a week. My workout routine consists of doing full body workout on Monday and Friday, and during T-W-T,I'm doing Push-Pull-Legs. I change it after a few months to not get bored."
getdisciplined,fd4liqo,t1_fd3ypqv,1578168662.0,"Yes, I use it on Android. I don't know if it's available on appstore"
getdisciplined,fd4lcjh,t1_fd1wtdc,1578168594.0,I've been asked that before. I don't really think I have a solid reason for doing that beside the fact that this is the way I did it since I've known myself. My gf brushes her teeth after breakfast and I also find that weird.
getdisciplined,fd3jg04,t1_fd38vqi,1578158917.0,"Exactly! I bought the premium version last year at a one time fee and I'm really glad I did. It has exactly everything I need. I also use it to keep on top of everything regarding my classes, gym sessions and studying time. I made a post on this sub showing my schedule. Maybe you can check that out."
getdisciplined,fd0vdgg,t3_ejsn3g,1578124269.0,"Hello! I use the TimeTune app and honestly is all I need. It has an easy to use interface, reminders and a function that shows me how much I'm spending daily or weekly doing a certain activity. You can create daily routines, if you're doing the same things everyday, or weekly routines, if you have a different schedule as the day passes."
getdisciplined,fd0uj0p,t1_fcz5gqe,1578123940.0,"I've been doing routines like this for a long time, even in highschool. I always liked to maximise my free time in my advantage. I started going to Uni after summer break when my routine got very loose. I'd say it took me about 3-4 weeks."
getdisciplined,fcy7k8d,t1_fcy6vj2,1578075902.0,"Not much. Depending on the day, I usually just put my phone away, watch TV, make some tea. Most of the time I try to be in bed by 21:45. I read that it takes 15 min to fall asleep, so I try to be asleep when 22:00 comes."
getdisciplined,fcxymm2,t3_ejg03i,1578072315.0,I forgot to mention that I use the TimeTune app that lets me plan all this. It also allows me to see how much time I spend doing a certain activity and its reminders help me keep track of things.
getdisciplined,fcxi97b,t1_fcxhfm6,1578063598.0,Yes. Mostly because that includes the time I wait until my deodorant dries so I can put on my shirt. So I walk shirtless around the house watching the news or smth else for like 10 min.
getdisciplined,fcxi3qt,t1_fcxhthf,1578063488.0,"Since October when I started going to University. It was hard at first until I got used to it. Sometimes I slip too, but I get back on track very soon."

stormbound,fcgrhcc,t1_fce8vy3,1577643313.0,"Got it, chief"
stormbound,fcgrg19,t1_fceexob,1577643299.0,Thank you for your advices! I'll do my best!
