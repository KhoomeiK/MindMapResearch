Hybrid battery fail
Inverter fail
Combo meter fail

CD player failure
Problems with my fobs

Just off the top of my head"

prius,fccjxti,t1_fccjbz7,1577599252.0,Itâ€™s hopefully just the 12v which will run you about $200. Toyota quoted me around $3600 for the big hybrid battery.
prius,fccjlls,t1_fccius9,1577599143.0,"And donâ€™t forget since your back hatch is completely locked youâ€™d have to climb through the back and unhinge this little panel thing to access the latch to unlock the hatch. Because that makes complete sense. 

Thereâ€™s access points to the battery under the hood."
prius,fccif9w,t3_eh1tdv,1577598749.0,"Annnnd because fuck this car in general (Iâ€™m a bit bitter about my 2008 purchase, can you tell?) call the autozone/whatever parts store nearby. None of my local stores carried the 12v youâ€™d need and I had to overnight it from amazon."
prius,fcci5pk,t1_fccehmb,1577598661.0,"Jump it with another car. Just be careful to look at the diagrams online, they suggest you connect the cables in a specific order."

Documentaries,fc1psbg,t3_efk9wb,1577325878.0,"I grew up in Manville NJ, where there used to be a huge huge huge asbestos factory. The whole town was named after it. Crazy how awful it is for you and how the towns economy was changed after the factory closed down. 

My upper grade elementary school was closed for a long time (my mom had gone there too) and reopened after they pulled all the insulation out/did some rehab. 

Nuts."
