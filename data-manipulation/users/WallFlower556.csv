selfesteemsupport,ffdzvs9,t3_eqaouq,1579833091.0,"Thank you I set up a counseling appointment with someone new today so we’ll see how that goes tomorrow, and with my last semester in school in full swing I have something new and fulfilling to work on despite my feelings. I’m really trying to do a 180 right now to keep myself on track and to be the person I know I am. Communicating is hard sometimes because I get so full of emotions I don’t know how to express and I’m not the best at it. Thank you for reaching out I really appreciate it"

venting,ffb8hys,t3_esgnx1,1579755000.0,"I’m so happy they replaced it quickly I definitely would classify a toilet as a necessity! I hope you week gets better and I hope your daughters feel better. You deserve to relax and know it never feels like you have the time or availability to, but maybe even 5minutes out of your routine to do something nice for yourself because you definitely need and deserve it"

selfesteemsupport,ffah1ce,t3_eshavt,1579735553.0,"Hey, I have the same issue with everything I do whether I’m drawing or painting, beading, or making music even. As soon as I catch myself in a mistake I get really flustered especially when it’s on paper. At one point it even stopped me from finishing projects. My best advice is just what works for me so I hope it helps you too. Which is to actually listen to what people tell you when they give you feedback, and do your best to start believing them. I know that seems impossible, but just ask yourself mid thought “maybe they’re right”. I also definitely believe in rotation and taking breaks. I know if I get too frustrated or upset with my artwork it’s not going to get me anywhere, so I put it down, I hide it out of sight, and I start working on another task or hobby that doesn’t take much effort but still has rewarding results (like beading, it looks super pretty but is pretty easy, or origami if I’m in the mood, but my main thing is singing because if I get 100% frustrated with all of those I can just fall back on something completely unrelated) think of some things you enjoy that you can fall back on. Then whenever you’re ready and calm you can revisit it, but only when you feel ready. If the sight of it makes you sad or angry after a few days give it some more time if you have to it’s okay, there’s no rush on good work because you’re always going to be improving yourself and refining your talent, it’s not a race it’s a journey. When you finally feel that inspiration again you will know when it’s okay to go back to it, and when you do you can go back with a clear head and remind yourself that nothing is perfect at the microscopic level or the astronomical level, many artists have gone through this, before and after you, even the most famous ones. It’s apart of growing into your own, and sometimes a part of art is to battle with yourself so you can think bigger or find new ideas. That’s how most animators and creative people find their niche, creators create their best received work on accident because someone else saw it and liked it. It wasn’t what they envisioned either but it worked. So you can keep working on it until it’s what you’ve envisioned and it doesn’t matter how many times you try. Just enjoy it, and know that your work and any perfections or imperfections it has does not equate to your self worth. Art may be a reflection of the soul, but it’s never a perfect image compared to your mind because thinking doesn’t require as much effort and skill as actually doing something"
hypochondria,ffaey2u,t3_esilbv,1579734115.0,"The only issue I can see is either suffering from bad side effects from taking medication more than you should, or your body building a tolerance. I don’t think one dose will do any harm, but I do think it might be a good idea to look into other options than resorting to medicine. I totally get how it would make you feel better, but I don’t think it’s the healthiest thing when you’re not certain if you are sick or not. Good luck friend and please stay safe"
