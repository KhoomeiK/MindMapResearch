HorriblyDepressing,ffbqhfg,t3_esmhac,1579778598.0,Horribly depressing to read. I lost my dad at 15 in a not so easy way and know exactly what he's talking about. You never really recover from something like it.
Whatisthis,ffbfxil,t3_esnacs,1579763546.0,"Other people have already beaten me to it, but that looks like a Mole crab to me. My family usually calls them sand crabs though. Used to be my favorite thing as a kid to dig them up- super easy to find where they dug down."

memes,fdpp6k9,t3_emkg0e,1578635338.0,I was high and this saved me
socialanxiety,fdorwgq,t1_fdnv02f,1578611516.0,"Ah man. Middle school I was such a social outcast I didn't know half of the students in my class. Was absent for a week once and no one seemed to be bothered by it. 

It's a good feeling tho when people do notice you. Come around to Highschool and I joined a program where I'd be with the same class mates for the entirety of high school. Learned everyone's name (that was a first) and befriended everyone. Absent for one day and come back to see that some people had missed me and caught me up on what I had missed. Felt real good to be included for once.It was sorta like a family or those really close group of friends. Really improved my high school experience."
casualiama,fdoqc25,t3_emcot2,1578610475.0,"From a trans guy to another, congrats! Wish I had the courage to come out at 15. 

What was the one moment that made you start questioning your gender?"
LifeProTips,fdnn88n,t3_em90bu,1578589308.0,10/10 recommend I do this everywhere bc anxiety. Alleviates stress and also saves time
socialanxiety,fdnk56p,t1_fdnjwlh,1578587491.0,Eh true. But I've graduated now so it's a bit late
AskReddit,fdnjsjn,t3_em7trd,1578587284.0,Animal jam. A kids game I started playing in 4 or 5th grade and played it all the way up I to freshman year

socialanxiety,fdm3i7p,t1_fdm39z6,1578538930.0,The teacher legit told me she thought I was absent bc I was so quiet. I had come up to her after class to ask a question and that's when she realized. While this happened multiple times :/ I was really quiet in middle school
socialanxiety,fdm2zjo,t3_em1qd6,1578538580.0,I had a teacher who marked me absent multiple times because I was too quiet.

Whatcouldgowrong,fdeex3c,t1_fdebjnc,1578337534.0,"Do you have a recommendation for one? I've been meaning to get one myself

Edit: thanks for all the recommendations! I'll be sure to look into all of them. People in my general area are not that great at driving and tend to flee scenes often and it's made me paranoid to drive. Hopefully a dashcam will ease the nerves a bit"
yiffinhell,fde9yr0,t1_fddekb2,1578334429.0,"Let's be honest here, who ever owns this most likely doesn't want to hide it and instead will show their guests"
eyeblech,fde9ols,t3_ekt4di,1578334250.0,Honestly if I didn't care about my appearance/want an okay job I'd totally do this and pair it with pointed/elf ears I think it would be neat
GenderCynical,fde9e3v,t1_fde8fe4,1578334065.0,"Dang. Yeah my experiences are mild/the complete opposite of that. Rather, I wouldn't have my cycle for upwards of 5-7 months. I did originally try to treat it with some birth control the doctor had given me but I reacted negatively to it no matter the brand or dosage size so either way treating the PCOS wasn't going to be simple for me. Fast forward like 2 years and me finally accepting that I'm trans/starting HRT. Pretty much I just plan on leaving it alone as it doesn't effect my life and I show no signs of developing anything more or it getting worse. I do keep a close eye on my health tho"
GenderCynical,fde5vur,t1_fddqjk0,1578331862.0,"Yikes that does not sound fun at all. I consider my self lucky bc the only problems I have are the basic ones and I don't have any uncomfortable or concerning things going on. Shame on the doctors though, they should try to help you as yours is more on the serious side"
GenderCynical,fdcp2uy,t1_fdcorfs,1578280462.0,"Not that I heard of. It has some other symptoms though. Like weight problems, menstrual problems, acne. From my knowledge the only treatment for it is birth control and other estrogen/female hormonal things. 

So I don't treat mine lol"
GenderCynical,fdcoots,t1_fdcodat,1578280176.0,"Polycystic ovary syndrome. It's basically a hormonal imbalance in women that most commonly causes unwanted hair growth, more specifically facial hair"
GenderCynical,fdcoibn,t3_ekktzy,1578280044.0,Oml. I have pcos and dealt with a beard/obsessive body hair before I even acknowledged what trans was.
trashy,fdcacbw,t1_fdca4hx,1578270256.0,Either way it's still spreading and gaining more acknowledgement for the fires so even if it's not that much she's still doing good and that's the positive bit! :)
trashy,fdc1ahh,t3_eke80f,1578265162.0,She's raised over 500k last time I checked
tattoos,fdakuqr,t3_ek5ll3,1578247200.0,I have a lot of love for tattoos that incorporate scars of some sort
