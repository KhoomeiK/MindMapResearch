GenderCritical,ffhuc62,t3_etpyzb,1579954289.0,"There was another thread that mentioned Joe Rogan and several commenters said they didn’t know much about him. I thought that I would share this video, which shows him at his worst. 

Self-described feminist Lydia Lunch confronted him after his show about his sexist representations of women. I can understand that she came across as mildly annoying, socially awkward person trying to force bravado. 

But she didn’t deserve to have him screaming in her face for several minutes, and physically intimidating her for the crime of being annoying. 

She tried several times to play it down, and act like she was unbothered and that it was a joke that she was in on. She was giving him several opportunities to act like it was just banter, and finish the attack. He didn’t take these opportunities and carried on relentlessly attacking her. 

To put it in to perspective how unnecessarily aggressive he was, Joe Rogan is a shortish man himself, only 5’7”, which shows how tiny Lydia Lunch is. He was literally revelling in physically dominating a tiny, middle-aged woman for the crime of criticising him.

The comments are appalling. It’s full of men gleeful that a woman is being viciously put in her place. They seriously think that a woman daring to criticise a man, is equal to a man standing over her, screaming in her face for several minutes and pushing her around."

EVERYONE brings up their children in their own lifestyle/belief system. It’s hateful to single out vegan parents for what literally every parent on the planet does. 

Meat-eater parents DO NOT give their children a choice to *not* be meat eaters. They don’t give them the information to make informed consent (in fact, they universally lie to their children). They don sit them down as preschoolers and say “we eat meat in this family, but it’s ok if you don’t want to”, like vegan parents are unfairly expected to do. Meat eaters are often extremely hostile when their children try to go vegetarian or vegan. Whereas vegan parents spend their time telling their children it’s their choice and to respect other people. 

ALL parents choose the lifestyle of their children until they are old enough to develop their own choices. This isn’t “forcing”. This is natural and an innate part of parenting. It’s disgusting and ignorant that you act like vegan families existing is a problem when they are doing the same thing that every other family in the world does.

GenderCritical,fdxp46w,t3_en5x1x,1578771414.0,"> none of them would have consented to sexual activity with you if they knew your true activity. 

So they did consent; and since one of the victims was 16 and therefore of age, the only thing that makes it sexual assault is the perpetrator being in “boy mode”. You would think this would confirm that presenting as the opposite sex to sex partners negates consent, but TIMs would never be treated like this. 

I’m not sure about the legal impact of the girls being underage; you have to be below age 13 for it to be statutory rape. Below age 16 is still illegal, but not rape if they consent. Also one of the victims was 16 and it’s still being treated as sexual assault. 

Age 16+ teen boys and young men have consensual sex with underage teen girls very often, and they rarely get in trouble for it. 

They are really throwing the book at this girl (as they should) but it makes it glaringly obvious how much leeway they give to male offenders. 

If she had been a young TIM, successfully grooming underage lesbians, he probably wouldn’t have even been charged. And if he was, it would be for something much more minor, with a tiny sentence, probably suspended. He also would have received ample sympathy and excuses for being genderspecial."

Abortion is ultimately about women’s bodily autonomy. The difficulties of parenthood are secondary, and used as an argument to convince people of the benefits of abortion. 

Allowing men to legally opt out of obligations to the child that they created, is coercion to force women to abort.

Anorexia nervous is a serious mental health condition caused by factors such as autism, child sex abuse, and genetics. 

Obesity is caused by simple overeating in most cases (but food addiction and binge eating disorder definitely exist), and by glorifying obesity it sets the standards of normal at an unhealthy level, so that fat people think there is nothing wrong with them. 

Only 7% of obese men and 10% of obese women recognise that they are obese. 

People typically only view bodies as overweight with a BMI of 35 or above.

Thin women should not be attacked for their appearance, including accusations of anorexia, or their bodies being held responsible for other people’s health. Women’s bodies are not public property.

Bear in mind we never have accurate stats for celebrity body sizes, as not only do they lie about height but their weights fluctuate. So all of this is a guess. However as a woman with a BMI of 19 who has been accused of being “anorexic” and “dangerously thin” since I was 10, I think I have a more accurate impression. 

Your anecdote cannot be proven, and “anorexic behaviours” is not a thing. Teenage girls briefly trying fad diets is not a severe mental health condition. Stop cheapening anorexia.

Also, most of the famous women of the noughties that you listed were not even underweight, let alone “emaciated to near death”. I am the same size or even smaller than some of those women in that era, and I am a healthy weight. No one knows what normal looks like any more and people lose their minds with outrage at the sight of low-end-of-normal women.
