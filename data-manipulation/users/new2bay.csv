CapitalismVSocialism,ffj4dmg,t1_ffiu5i1,1579990089.0,"It’s not legal, but it’s only punishable by fines in most cases, _i.e._ a “cost of doing business.”"

rpg,ffbhp3a,t1_ffbcq6k,1579765787.0,"Take a look at _GURPS_ 4th edition.  There's a free PDF of _GURPS Lite_ that contains the basic core of the game.  When you get _really_ into it, there are 2.5 shelf feet of hardcover books plus a ton of smaller supplements you can use as bits to cobble together your own perfect system."

ExperiencedDevs,ff6lsdt,t3_erox5z,1579629924.0,"Both my direct manager and my director are very experienced and have both written code in the past year (not for our company though). My manager has over 10 years management experience, and my director has maybe 5 (I’m not sure). 

Neither one of them have even so much as attempted to micromanage me in the ~1 year I’ve been at this company (large, public company, ~1000 engineers)."
Coins4Sale,ff6lfy9,t3_ervzbb,1579629712.0,"How MS and how toned? Raw or certified? Any particular dates? I have a couple, but I would have to dig them up, and a little more specificity would help. :-)"
CoinEyeCandy,ff6l7cb,t1_ff6k8iw,1579629565.0,"Yeah, I’ve caught a few good deals on eBay the same way. Had I seen this coin, I probably would have taken a chance, since an 09-VDB isn’t incredibly expensive until you get to like MS-67 or something, and there’s no way a raw coin is going for that kind of money.

If I remember, I’ll post my 1957-D later today. Got it off a dealer at cost, because they overestimated the grade PCGS would assign by 1 point, and it wasn’t worth resubmitting even if it came back that point higher."
CoinEyeCandy,ff6jvbg,t3_ervfo7,1579628755.0,"I like it! I can’t remember if I need an 09-VDB for my type set, but, if I do, I hope it’s as pretty as this one. :)"

If you have, or can simulate, a Douglas Adams-esque sense of humor, you'll do great running this game.  If you have a sense of humor at all, you'll do fine.  :)  

It's available as a [PDF download at DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/2010/Tales-From-The-Floating-Vagabond), currently on sale for $6.98.  There's also a second edition that had a Kickstarter a few months ago, but I don't know the status of it.  First edition is plenty fun, though, and can you argue with a $7 game?"
papermoney,ff634fc,t1_ff5k5rc,1579617937.0,"Even misaligned, I don’t think it would garner a serious premium. I’ve always heard that part of the design needs to be missing before you get into real money."
