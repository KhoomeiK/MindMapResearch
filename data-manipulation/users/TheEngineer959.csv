todayilearned,feq3cg6,t1_feok9b1,1579337045.0,Just make sure you put it in your hold luggage not carry-on; otherwise it might get confiscated.
gaming,fenig2g,t3_epzv4o,1579285382.0,Replace the screen. Easy to do.
todayilearned,fenh1sv,t1_fengf31,1579284520.0,"Exactly; and that’s only considering those who are ‘known’ to have hunted.

It’s conceivable (AFAIK, not being in the US, so happy to be corrected), to buy a gun privately, and so leaving no record that you own it, but assorted other equipment at yard sales and similar, then go hunting and get the materials needed that way.

That’s really taking the anonymity drive to extremes, but if you drove your car to the area without having your gun and kill obviously on display, (even easier if you only want the hooves to bring home), and hadn’t told anyone else what you were doing, even if you were caught on camera in the area, you could claim to just be out hiking.

If you sold the gun privately again afterwards, maybe even sold the car to ensure no traces of gunpowder / animal were able to be tied to you, you’d have homemade glue that was effectively untraceable to you, particularly if you disposed of even that after sending the ‘package’."
todayilearned,fencm1x,t1_fencgee,1579281815.0,Likewise. Decent “what-if” scenario conversations are always a pleasure.
todayilearned,fenbggw,t1_fen9hx6,1579281105.0,"LOL Fair argument.

My point is that being seen buying those might not be the only piece of evidence, but it might be what gets ‘you’ onto their suspects list in the first place.

At which point, when they’re comparing other pieces of evidence you might fit into the categories being considered, which wouldn’t have been possible if you hadn’t been ‘caught’ buying the glue.

It would be about minimising the risk of being identified at every opportunity, hence make rather than purchase."
todayilearned,fen7awv,t1_fen6r42,1579278542.0,"Oh I get the point, but travelling all over the place actually increase the potential risk, at least in the modern world.

Let’s say you do that, buy multiple glue types from multiple places; if they can identify with a reasonable degree of certainty even two of the types and batches, and then start searching locations where those batches were sold, you stand a good chance of being picked up on a CCTV or traffic camera in the area.

If you were picked up in a completely different area also known to have sold some of the potentially suspect glue, you’ve now got to explain why you were in two hugely different areas, in two unrelated stores, on the stores security cameras and till receipt records as having bought glue that matches the forensics they’ve got from the investigation.

None of that is even a risk if you make it yourself."
todayilearned,fen1cz1,t1_fen17rr,1579274782.0,"I’d imagine so, now at least. Clearly there wasn’t to sufficient extent back then, or the area covered was still really wide and would cause a suspect list of anyone who’s hunted in that area, or driven through it (roadkill), or visited the area to buy hooves in cash from an abattoir."
todayilearned,fen17sk,t1_fen0bpg,1579274689.0,Still risks you being added to a ‘potential suspects list’ because there’s a record of you having bought glue from the batch of interest.
todayilearned,fen14sf,t1_fen05av,1579274635.0,"Making it definitely requires more effort, absolutely no argument there.

But, from the context of the OP discussion point, buying any glue that could have been traced risks putting you into a suspect pool, and that might be the single piece of information that breaks the investigation open.

From a risk management perspective, if you want to do bombings like that, and get away with it rather than suicide / public spectacle approach, then more effort for less risk is a worthwhile trade off."
