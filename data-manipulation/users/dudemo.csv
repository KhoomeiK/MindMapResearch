The fact is that I'm simply an aggressive player in any game I play. I play to win. Also, I play intelligently. I'll notice things that others don't, and use it to my advantage. Lastly, I **never** play for money. Not for pennies, nickels, quarters or favors. Some people take that as me managing the deck in my favor to win and that I don't hide it, so I won't play for money. In truth, I just enjoy the game and feel that playing for money or favors cheapens the games. You shouldn't need that extra incentive to want to beat me. Play your hardest always."

Having too many CCA's really isn't a thing. Normally I'd say go with the midrange battery because it is going to do everything you need it to do unless you drive a vehicle with so many aftermarket lightbars and speakers you blind and deafen half of Fort Wayne. But lately we get these things called polar vortexes where the frozen arctic air pushes down to us and freezes us out.

Last year got down to the negatives. Well into the negatives. My wife parks in the garage because I'm a good husband and because it's easier for me to get out the front door in my wheelchair. Her battery swelled up first and I had to replace it. Not 24 hours later, mine did the same in my van. So I bought the biggest battery I could for each from Interstate on Speedway.

I don't and never have drank alcohol steadily enough to get drunk. Diabetic. But my then girlfriend (now wife) was drinking with her mom, and they ran out of vodka. I didn't want any of them driving, so I volunteered to go to the store for them. The store was about 20 miles away.

I hopped on the state highway and drove. It was mostly dry, but a snow storm had come through a few hours ago. The roads were mostly clear and there wasn't any wind. I hit black ice. My truck turned into the opposite lane. I over corrected and now I'm in the opposite lane and my truck is skidding driver side into a semi truck. Yeah. It hit me. I kind of got it straightened out, but he hit me in the driver side front quarter panel and driver's door.

That's the last I remember until I woke up in the hospital. I was comatose for days medically and then more days after without help. The total ended up being varied between medical professionals and my family. Once I woke up and was given a cognitive test, I was informed that there was several things wrong with me. My orbital socket, clavicle, a few ribs, a few spine bones, my hip, knee, and ankle were all basically destroyed. 

The spine injury basically ruined two vertebrae. ""Shrapnel damage"" from my vertebrae did extensive spinal cord damage that left me paraplegic. A rib damaged my pneumothorax and my lung collapsed. It was reinflated successfully. I have a fake hip because it was mainly fragments. I have rods in my thigh and in my shin to support my fucked knee. They didn't want to replace it basically because I won't be using it. My left eye now has a noticable ""droop"".

It isn't an easy fix. Working on a PC is entirely different than working on a mobile device. You will need tiny screwdrivers.

You'll also have a retainer setup that acts as a touchpad of sorts. It requires a mouthpiece contraption. It is not usable (last I knew) with someone that has a full denture set such as I have.

Life hasn't gotten much better since the mid 2000's. We desperately need someone to enhance our control. Driving has gotten much better which enables us to be more independent, however daily life is still a struggle."

I have source code for the drum piece."

interestingasfuck,fcbh727,t1_fcb5p6y,1577586821.0,"No. I very rarely move and speak at the same time. As I, and my chair have as much weight (I'm 135, my chair is about that. Perhaps more with the extra battery) movement means power draw. I've become accustomed to stationary speaking especially because I can no longer talk with my hands/arms. (I can, but imagine doing so while sitting always. It's prohibitive.)

I will speak my part when ready. I can wait. It actually makes me a better speaker and listener because it is more difficult for me to gesticulate while having a conversation. 

My primary concern is multitasking while driving my chair. My tongue, while not in use, could be used to steer my chair while my arms/fingers are engaged in my inbuilt computer (a Pi 4, 4Gb) or using my phone. Both interact with my chair to provide location and Bluetooth. There's a multitude of aspects I could utelize if manufacturers were willing. (For example, Tasker routines for when I'm home, in my vehicle, or simply steering my chair.)

I understand that I could do all of this with a ""rooted"" device. I don't believe this should be required. There are many such apps for us ""broken"" people, however simply creating a new ""appendage"" using haptic feedback has so much wasted potential or is cost prohibited. It's fucking stupid."
interestingasfuck,fcau0rn,t1_fca5kgv,1577576594.0,"Real shit. I've looked into this as a paraplegic. I have an electric wheelchair that I use a hand to control, but it would be nice to have both hands free and also steer. It's very expensive and I would have to pay like 85% of it simply because it's an ""elective"" surgery.

Also I have dentures. That makes it harder apparently."
Pixel3,fc9m6xq,t3_egsma1,1577554759.0,"Everyone keeps saying ""law enforcement"". While I think his might actually be true, I don't think OP is going to get anywhere with this option. Law enforcement has enough to do already. They won't have the time or resources to help OP.

I think your best bet would be to contact a lawyer and have the lawyer contact Google with proof of ownership, a death certificate, and all that stuff. If you can prove relationship and death, I'm sure Google would at least be willing to listen."

PlaystationClassic,fc4ci52,t1_fc4a185,1577412699.0,"Hey no problem. I bought a boat load of these things when Target had them on sale for $15. I gave a bunch out for Christmas this year and have a few (like 3) extras.

I'm not sure what games yours comes with, but keep in mind the thing will be NTSC-NA. Dunno if that affects your TV or not, so again be aware of that too.

Feel free to PM me if you find you want to take me up on this."
