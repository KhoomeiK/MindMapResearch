One option might be to base it off an existing magic item or just reskin one that does the damage you want it to."

I've always done XP in grittier games, since the little increments feel appropriate in the context of the detail level of grit. Alternately, I could see milestone being used to let players stop focusing on XP and let them focus more on the more thematic elements."

NiceHash,fg3vx95,t3_ewqvtv,1580490818.0,"The policy was that in order to get paid a portion you would need to mine an equal portion. So, in theory if you mined 1 BTC in profit you would get back 2 as long as you had balance to restore. In your case the first 0.3 BTC you mined would net you 0.6 in returns. This maxed out at whatever percentage they had restored. So, at the moment you could earn 82% of your original BTC this way. 

They've paused at 82% since that's equal to the number of original BTC they lost, not the fiat currency value, the actual BTC. They intend to continue returning it but at this point it is effectively stopped until the situation changes and they can continue the last 18%."
dndnext,fg3rlmq,t1_fg3eg8y,1580488162.0,"Grit means enjoying the pleasure of discomfort. You have to have buy in from the players to intentionally avoid the things that make 5e an easier system. They have to like the idea of forcing the inconvenience of grit against the desire to use the epic abilities they are given by the system. 

Even with buy in, players are going to optimize for their best case / comfort. Lower rest or breaking equipment will encourage the party to stick closer to cities. That puts it on you to make the players care about leaving the safe area. 

Slower recovery changes the value of classes as well. Available healing becomes more valuable so PCs are likely to change what they play, possibly avoiding the character they want to play.

Finally, also think how the game you build will change after the first tier. How do the PCs still feel limited by the constraints in a way that's enjoyable."

dndnext,fg0sy2w,t1_fg0pvnt,1580414396.0,"I tried a ""half-grit"" system in a recent game. I'm unsure if I liked the effects. It put a ton of pressure on the bard in the party at low levels. He was super hesitant to ever cast a spell and if it missed it was super disappointing. It also prevented them from wanting to leave the city basically ever. 

\- 1 hour lets you use hit dice and things like Song of rest  
\- overnight is short rest  
\- 24 hours of rest in a place of safety is a long rest (generally this means a day in a city)  


I'm not sure I'd use it again. Instead I might go the opposite way and make a short rest occur more often. The idea would be that there has to be time for lunch and dinner during the day, which means that there's got to be at least 2 short rests built into each day. Mechanically I could encourage this by making them make low-dc con saves to avoid exhaustion if they skip 2 meals."

One amazing resource for DM's is Matt Coleville's running the game series. He makes skilling up your DM skills feel approachable.

I'd also recommend checking out season 2 of critical role (no need to watch season 1, which is tough to get into). It's great inspiration but absolutely don't hold yourself or your players to their amazingly high bar. Even just the first couple episodes are worth watching as a group to get you a sense of one way to play."
UnearthedArcana,ff6wqal,t1_ff6v545,1579636460.0,"Flight amounts to a free misty step like effect in many situations, fly up 15' then down 15'.

Invisibility is exceptionally powerful, esp when combined by the ability to move without the sound of your feet. Access to Lesser Restoration removes a lot of the danger mechanics that can keep play varied and interesting. To a lesser extent the same applies to gentle repose, which is a 2nd level spell to boot. 

Swift gives you a full flight speed. Compare that to Aarakocra, who get fly plus a d4 talon attack and nothing else. 

Skirmisher's ability to use a first level spell repeatedly is unlike any other race. At most races tend to get one use of a 1st level spell at 3rd level."

asktransgender,fdrq3eo,t1_fdrjq0t,1578688050.0,"That's what I meant by saying that ""my religion should make you feel good"" crosses the line. The problem with the sentences you mention is that there is an impled *should* hiding in there. So to be more precise the phrase ""god loves you"" really means ""god loves you and you should feel good about that"". That pushing of beliefs is what's not ok.

Context is also important and social factors effect language usage as well and can't be discounted. For example it used to be considered quite rude to mix up Ms/Mrs/Miss where as now that differentiation feels dated and slightly insulting. There are places where ""god bless you"" is the polite way of giving genuine thanks. In those cases they aren't saying anything religious it's just verbal short hand. It's like saying ""how are you  doing?"" after saying hi. It's not like you are really asking for them to explain their personal details, it's just polite and how conversations go. 

Generally speaking, it's considered polite to keep politics and religion to yourself. Not being polite isn't the same as being offensive though."

Is it unreasonable that spaces should remove <insert topic> that some people in a community find important and others do not, solely on the basis that some of the people have trauma surrounding it. 

**Yes, that is unreasonable.** assuming it's not something which brings (something like) emotional or physical violence to the community. Ex: jumping in to advertise conversion therapy in a queer space definitely crosses a line. 

In early transition my stupid brain would kick me in the dysphoria whenever I saw a woman with a pony tail. For some reason it just hit me hard. It would be silly to assert that no one could have pony tails just because I was uncomfortable. 

On the other hand, there's a line between sharing something that's important and someone being pushy. It's fine for someone to say ""my religion makes me feel good but it's not fine to say ""my religion should make you feel good"". 

*The problem here isn't the inclusion of religion, the problem is the way this theoretical person isn't respecting other people's boundaries.*"

And yet... I still wake up every couple months , look in the mirror, and have my brain say ""ok, but what if you aren't really trans"". It's so out of place that it's comical.

Brains are weird places. Accepting a new thing that's different takes some time. You have to convince a bunch of different systems in your head that the new thing is ok. Those parts take time to adapt and they don't all go in sync. 

TLDR; yes, fear and doubt are 100% normal for any big change."
