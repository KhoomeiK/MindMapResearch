Also, if they calculated by wins or K/D, the game would be completely unfair."
FortniteSwitch,fex2iuo,t3_eqpgo9,1579423241.0,"In case you are wondering about Skill Based Match Making (SBMM), here’s a quick explanation.


Your SBMM points are calculated by adding up your Combat, Building, and Edit speed.


Combat: Your combat skill is calculated by counting your overall bullets throughout a match and subtracting your bullets used throughout the match.


Overall bullets - Bullets used = Combat Score


Building: Your building score is calculated by counting your overall building structures placed throughout a match minus your overall materials and the result of that subtraction is multiplied by how fast you place structures.


(Building structures placed - overall materials) x placement speed = Building Score


Edit Speed: Your edit speed is calculated by counting your edit speed multiplied by successful edits.


Edit Speed x successful edits = Edit Speed


These are added up and the result of these are used to create better matches but sometimes this system fails, that’s why Epic should change their calculations system."

FortniteSwitch,femfph6,t3_epwrpg,1579253102.0,"Because of the fast paced storm and slow amount of time to load assets and workloads, some stuff like building renders, FPS drops and like you said, Aim Assist, tend to “skip” meaning that they are slightly ignored to help with FPS and performance.
