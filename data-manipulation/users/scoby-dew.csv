The doctor's offices will still have record of treatment and the pharmacies will still have you in their systems.

Besides, trying to use people's medical conditions against them is a two-way sword.Firstly, if MIL obtains these records through fraudulent means (taking the time to explicitly ban her from access will ensure that's the only way she can), it's a crime and can be prosecuted.  Secondly, if things went to court, the medical records would only show that that a medical condition is being proactively dealt with in a way that's consistent with being a responsible adult.   On the other hand, if it came out that someone was trying to hide that they're receiving treatment, it would not look so good.

TL/DR: If you have a mental health problem, address it.  If someone accesses your medical records illegally, prosecute.  If someone tries to use your having sought treatment for mental health issues against you, hold your head high with the knowledge that you have being doing the right thing for yourself and your family."
