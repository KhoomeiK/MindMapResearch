WritingPrompts,fejql85,t3_epj0pf,1579183354.0,"His voice stops me in my tracks. It has this, imperious, piercing quality that rings clear through my music. I take off my headphones. Turning so I can take a proper look, my eyes meet his, and I flinch. His gaze is like his voice, authoritative, and penetrating.

“I’m sorry?” I manage. The confrontation has thrown me off. 

“I am the King of Nothing. Tell me what you seek.” He repeats, with the same somber, careful intonation as before. 

He must be trying to tell me a joke, I think to myself. Yes, this must be a bit, or something like that. I’ll go along with it. 

“Well” I begin, “King of Nothing,” I add, to ensure proper respect and all that, “It’s been a long day, I’m headed home, gonna fix myself a hot cocoa and hit the hay.”

The King of Nothing does not laugh, and for a moment, his expression does not change at all. In that moment, we maintain eye contact, he has bright blue eyes. I find myself staring into those eyes like a man might stare into a deep hole. If I get any closer, I might fall in, I think.

Then, the King of Nothing smiles. “A modest goal, warmth for the body, nourishment for the soul.” He nods in approval. I’m about to thank him for this, strange, interaction, when he continues. “You may find what you seek, closer than you think.”

I open my mouth to ask him for clarity, or thank him and move on, I couldn’t be sure, but the sound was stopped by a presence in my hand. Cupped in my right hand, like I’d been holding it this whole time, was a ceramic cup, the contents of which was completely recognizable, and piping hot.

The words don’t come, I stand there, blinking between the King of Nothing, and the unmistakeable cup of hot cocoa in my hand. The King of Nothing only smiles, and winks a single, blue eye, before saying.

“Remember Son, you seek a droplet within an ocean.” 

My brain, still trying to come to terms with the hot drink in my hands, allows his words to wash over and through me. I nod dumbly, thanking him.

“Go forth in peace.” He dismisses me with a gentle wave of the hand, and my feet respond, kicking into a brisk walk to my house. 

I make it fifteen feet before I look back, but the sidewalk is empty, and the King of Nothing is gone. I continue, chalking the incident up to some, strange freaky happening that I won’t bother anyone about.

But the hot cocoa in my hands stays warm the whole walk back, and it tastes like summer."
