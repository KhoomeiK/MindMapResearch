MAOIs,fec0oqz,t1_fdtm77e,1578964915.0,Thank you so so much
MAOIs,febzx7i,t1_fe6irio,1578964739.0,Wow beautifully articulated. Thank you. I’ll keep that in mind.
highthoughts,fdzqsmp,t3_en40z0,1578793664.0,Uhhhh as a tax preparer ( enrolled agent) I don’t get this at all. And I smoke.
MAOIs,fdylq50,t1_fdxcec4,1578781179.0,"I have no idea to be honest. I’ve cut back a lot from Kratom. And I do get rls when I cut back from Kratom but only when i fall asleep or try to lay down. 

I’ll bring it up to my doctor."
MAOIs,fdycp0p,t1_evyeui0,1578778323.0,Is there is a discoed channel I can join for maoi takers?
MAOIs,fdt0263,t1_fdszb5r,1578710174.0,"I agree, I rather have some physical pain than go through rls. That urge to move your body is so freaking annoying."
MAOIs,fdszw08,t1_fdsemzl,1578710108.0,"It really sounds like the psychotic symptoms were brought on by the Maois. Sometimes, I think I should just stick to things like abilify ( best I’ve ever felt.) but it’s hard to take it cuz mentally ( and this is really dumb I realize ) I don’t want to be taking an anti-psychotic med. but it’s really helped my depression as far as obsessive thought about my moods go. But my motivation stayed stagnant."
MAOIs,fdsyt57,t1_fdsusss,1578709712.0,Thanks will do
MAOIs,fdstghh,t1_fdssxfn,1578707720.0,"Don’t touch it in my opinion. 

I just remembered before I ever touched Kratom though, I tried Wellbutrin and i had the same issue. I felt like I needed to crawl out of my skin.

Yes, Nardil is my first maoi. Crossing fingers it’ll do the job."
MAOIs,fdqtql9,t1_fc2jvs6,1578674685.0,"Hi I’m not op but saw you said you’re an anesthesiologist and wanted to ask you if I’ll be ok. I just a started nardril 15 mg. And I was getting ketamine infusions ( last one about 1.5 months ago ) but taking lozenges at home. Last one I took was on Monday (300mg.) suffice it to say it didn’t work for my depression anymore. I also had a colonoscopy on Monday. Got yelled at by the anesthesiologist a lot for being prescribed lozenges ( not my fault .) He gave me half the dosage of propofol ( not sure If that’s the right spelling.) 

Anyways, my question... is it safe to take nardril ?"
MAOIs,fdqt2qf,t1_fahnr8p,1578674282.0,"Hi, did you stop the nardril? I’m starting today. I’m extremely paranoid exactly like you when you say “ trust no one - “ but I have never hallucinated and I don’t think I would handle it ver well.
I hope yours stopped after stopping your maoi ?"
MAOIs,fdqomb0,t1_fdqo926,1578671527.0,Thank you so much for all the info !!This will help me taper down.... I wanted off of Kratom since I was self medicating out of desperation anyways.
MAOIs,fdqlrb5,t1_f5g82xu,1578669697.0,"Hi, I just started nardril 15 mg. I’ve been taking Kratom for years to combat my lack of energy and focus. It’s not that i want to keep taking it. I’m afraid of the withdrawals so I wanted to do a a slow taper. I take 2-3 tea tea spoons spread out through out the day. If my depression is really bad I’ll take a tablespoon. 

I guess I’m wondering if it’s safe for me to taper down from Kratom while taking Nardil. I have clonazepam on deck so I’m thinking if my blood pressure goes too high I’ll take some of that??

Your post definitely scared the heck out of me. I hope the meds are all still working for ya."
MAOIs,fdqheuu,t1_f884s88,1578666734.0,Hi! I just started parang 15 mg. Just took my first dose and I’m just wondering if you’re still feeling as amazing. I’ve had had treatment resistant depression for 10 years so if this works I’ll be over the moon.
MAOIs,fdozgcr,t3_elpckk,1578616402.0,"I just got a prescription for nardril ( generic .) wondering the same. Although, I’ve gotten my hopes up so many times based on other people’s experiences with other medications and then waboom it doesn’t work for me."
MAOIs,fdh3q4e,t3_eionhq,1578414721.0,"Did you try it? I can’t take adhd meds at all. I’ve tried them all from addedal to Ritalin. I can’t handle the crashes no matter how small they are. So my life is at a halt. I’m looking into asking for an maoi,"
