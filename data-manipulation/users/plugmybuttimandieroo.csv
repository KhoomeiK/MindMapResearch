RBI,ffaudgv,t1_ffat8wb,1579744702.0,"My *uneducated* advice would be to see a doctor. It’s always best to be proactive than to be reactive. You could just tell them “I was diagnosed with something that had to with delusions and hallucinations at 7. I got diagnosed with something but don’t remember. (At that point they can request medical records if they’re still available.) and I’m concerned because I heard it may come back around my current age.

That would be a good start towards starting a conversation with a medical professional so you can take preventive measures (if available) or run some tests.

In the meantime this may sound dumb but think positive. I’m not saying that in the think positive and hope for the best kind of way. I’m a firm believer that thinking positive can help. In a chemical way. 

“Im not getting sick, I’m good”
“I will not have a panic attack, I’m good”
Even
“I will wake up on time, I’m good.”
(Last one is I have major anxiety about being late to places”

These are all examples I firmly believe that thinking positively have helped my mind stay on track.
I’m not saying it will affect anything for you but I’m hoping it will. <3 

“You will be okay, you’re good”

RBI,ffans8r,t1_ffanjmq,1579740290.0,"Your depression and anxiety could have roots in this time of your life. And my *guess* is you had residual schizophrenia. Then is dissipated and as a lingering symptom you are left with depression and anxiety. I could be totally wrong as I am not a medical professional, but from what I’ve read it seems palpable."
