introvert,ffrwf22,t3_eup0t4,1580167394.0,"All 3 of my children are introverts as am I. I don't know how that turned out that way. I certainly raised them to be. My youngest daughter is an attorney she works for a Judge doing appeals so she is not standing in a courtroom with a bunch of people. When she graduated she did not even want to go to the ceremony but we all convinced her she might regret it. Somehow she got her name at the top of the list to be called on stage. ( her last name starts with an R so it would have been a while) and she ran over to us and said let's go! And we did. My other daughter is a nurse at a hospital so she focuses on her 4 patients a day and then goes home. Both of them travel the world solo for months at a time. They don't even travel together! Lol
Unlike me they are not awkward around people or shy even. They just prefer their own company and their dogs over human beings. I'm so glad I am an introvert so I understand them and  I would never push them or think they are mentally I'll in any way."
CasualConversation,ffrvazl,t3_euqfaj,1580166651.0,"I always do this when I am on vacation alone. I often see women ( moms) taking a pic of their kids like I did for years. It's sad now to look back and see that I wasn't in most pictures,I was always behind the camera.  Last summer I was I  the San Juan Islands and I saw this couple with a 5 yr old boy that did not want his picture taken and his mom was trying so hard. I walked over and offered to take their pic and the boy ran away ( we were on a lavender farm so he wasn't in any danger). I calmly walked over to him and told him I HATE to get my picture taken. Most kids are caught off guard when an adult tells them the truth. Anyway I made him a deal, I would buy him an ice cream if he agreed to take some pictures. He ran back to his parents and allowed me to take a bunch of pictures in different poses. At the end the mom came over to me  tears flowing and said she had just adopted him and they have been on vacation for the last month and these were the only pictures she had of them together."

introvert,ffmx12h,t3_eu614e,1580059766.0,"Complete strangers have always told me to smile. Once a man refused to let me buy something in his store unless I smiled! 

1. I am not a fake person so I don't walk around like the joker just smiling for no reason.

2. I hate my smile.

3. My life has been hell.

4. I have never asked or said to anyone that they should smile more or it can't be that bad etc. I accept people where they are and admire them for being themselves.



I hate getting my picture taken. I recently decided to never be in a photo again. I was having a perfectly happy day out with my daughter. We went to a Christmas show. I actually asked a bystander to take our picture. My daughter sent it to me later that night. She said why do you have to smile like your are the most miserable person alive? And I was completely happy taking that picture. So never again. 


Having said all that, I have an excellent sense of humor and friends have always said I am the funniest person they know. I make myself laugh on a daily basis. I laugh outloud several times a day. 

I think my not smiling is from being a mix of introvert, horrible childhood and being a scorpio. I can't change any of those things so it is what it is.

I am so happy you asked that question because I thought it was just me."
socialanxiety,ffjd2dr,t3_etwvyg,1579995733.0,I have always had the startled reflex. Like an infant. I am easily scared and jumpy. I even freak out when I think I see someone hiding. Scares the hell out of everyone around me. I figure I have a strong reflex to wanting to live.
socialanxiety,ffjcow9,t3_etx3s8,1579995512.0,Can you tell us what medication?
socialanxiety,ffjchz0,t3_etq53v,1579995399.0,I was as a child but grew out of it as an adult. Now I pretty much don't give AF. I desperately wish I had not outgrown it.
socialanxiety,ffjaoq0,t3_etvudw,1579994344.0,"I always had jobs where it was 1 on 1. Massage therapist, dog trainer and nanny.  I am never anxious around kids. They are honest,they live in the moment and they accept you unconditionally."
socialanxiety,ffja2ep,t3_etr7ah,1579993953.0,Buy yourself a bouquet of flowers and write I love you on the card.
LifeProTips,ff128gf,t3_eqr256,1579474489.0,I recently read that licking salt stops you from craving sweets.
depression,fezaxm4,t3_cifomo,1579455504.0,"I have been on it for 2 months and I never sweat which is weird for me because I have always been a sweater.

These pretty blue capsules are a life changer. I've been in intensive dbt therapy for the last 10 months. Once I crawled out of the hell I've been in I started to feel like I want to now add good experiences to my life but I just couldn't leave my house. I would drive all the way to church or a book club meeting and could not get out of the car. So I would drive home. I could not make small talk to anyone in public. I put off phone calls for weeks and months. I was that shy and reserved. So I asked my psychiatrist if she could give me something to help me . This medication works subtlety. 

I just keep noticing little things that are making me more outgoing. I feel happy and content 99% of the time now. My mind is clear, my memory is stronger and my negativity/ sarcasm has decreased a lot. 

I was not given this for depression but for social anxiety. I am so grateful the first medication I was prescribed worked! I feel that good things are coming my way and I enjoy each day more and more."
NewAmsterdamTV,felzk4t,t3_eomxln,1579235050.0,I almost turned it off when bloom starts doing surgery. It was worse than ANY soap opera I've ever seen.  I was embarrassed for the show.
TrueCrime,felxn6e,t1_feftzrh,1579233534.0,I think the dog was barking and that would attract neighbors. I've read that  criminals do this all time when they break in a house.
AskReddit,fefxybh,t3_eou6il,1579068942.0,That my mother was alive. She died when I was an infant. I prayed and begged god to let her come to me as a ghost even for just a moment. That's all I ever cried over or begged for.
GodFriendedMe,febqxxh,t3_enwog2,1578961685.0,I thought it was the most depressing episode ever! Everybody opened their big mouths before the wedding. They couldn't wait 1 day? Rude. I don't watch this show to feel depressed.
GodFriendedMe,fdinibg,t3_eknadn,1578446857.0,"Did anyone else see how all the women has EXACT same hair cut? Except Joy. Cara, her mom and Ali. Same style and same length.

Maybe I just need a haircut.

It took me a long time to warm up to Joy, it was nice having  her back."
christmas,fd5aq37,t3_ek2nsy,1578175798.0,I only take the outside decorations down. My tree and all inside decorations stay up year round. It helps that I live alone and that my home already is decorated in a victorian theme. I love sitting by my lighted Christmas tree every night reading or watching tv.
confessions,fczbek8,t3_ej8zvv,1578097519.0,"My therapist just confided in me that she has suicidal thoughts and that everyone has thought about suicide at least once. Maybe that is the reason no one but me has responded to your post.

Also, I have been suicidal since I was 9 years old. Suicide became my best friend. Then I finally found a therapist who helped me. 

As of July 29th I am no longer suicidal. I have no suicidal thoughts at all. 

NOTHING changed in my life except for DBT therapy. 

I haven't won the lottery, haven't found love, haven't gotten a better job , car or house. 

40 years of nonstop suicidal urges, thoughts and 4 attempts. Took less than 6 months of therapy.

There is only 1 thing that would make me commit suicide and that is getting dementia or some incurable disease. Thankfully  I live in a state that allows physician assisted suicide."

CasualConversation,fcyt4gg,t3_ejglqo,1578086508.0,They only ever ask me for donations at Christmas time. Somebody needs to tell them to pick a different time of year.
IsItBullshit,fcjhn9o,t3_ehe28z,1577687945.0,I will never own a red vehicle again. Lots of tickets even when other cars were passing me! I've had a white suv and a blue sedan for the last 13 years and I've never gotten a ticket in either.
christmas,fcadju4,t3_egsrli,1577567395.0,"I keep my tree and all decorations up year round! Everything is plugged in all the time too. Wreaths,garland, tree etc. I've done this since I became an adult. I also watch Christmas movies year round."
