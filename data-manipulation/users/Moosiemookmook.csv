UnresolvedMysteries,feaneeu,t3_eo5vk6,1578950552.0,"I was in year 6 and walked home every day with my best friend who lived on my street in the same suburb as the school. She was a lot shorter than me. One afternoon I was kept after the bell and by the time I got to the front of the school she wasn't there. I later found our she had walked around the corner to see if I was walking up the side road next to the school. 

As I come around the corner I see a car parked on the road and my bf talking to an older man who had a map pulled out the window (1980's so maps were a thing). As I said she's short and couldn't see over the lip of the window properly. 

I walked over quickly because I got bad vibes. As I approached the window I could see his other hand under the map and that his penis was in it. He was masturbating while she tried to give him directions and she said after that he was trying to get her to hop in the car to show him where to go. 

I hadn't seen an adult penis before and I immediately start screaming. My bf is still not aware of what was going on but starts screaming because I am. The man drives off and we run back to the school after-care area and notified the teacher there. She rang the police and our parents and we had to speak to the police officer. 

We were still hysterical and didn't get a licence plate but were able to give a pretty good description of him and the car. The school placed teachers at the exit points for the next week around the school and police patrolled for a few days but it was back to business as usual after that. 

My bf was tiny, young looking for her age and a fairly meek type of kid. Perfect victim for a predator. She wouldn't have stood a chance if she had hopped in the car. It is terrifying to think what could have happened if I had waited longer at school or been kept back longer."
