AskReddit,fdvsix6,t1_fds2oli,1578751071.0,"Oh wow, I had somehow blocked this part from my memory. The scummy Expedia calls. God they were literally the worst part of that job."
AskReddit,fdvs2yz,t1_fdug4ua,1578750917.0,"Once I had told someone we didnt have any twin rooms left. He was insisting that I was lying because expedia showed we had them. I tried explaining to him that I could physically see in front of me what we had and their listing was incorrect as it often is. He thought he could outsmart me and stand in front of the desk booking one of the twin rooms through expedia on his phone. Guess what happened? Followed by ""so sorry, but now I cant refund you because you booked through a third party."""
AskReddit,fdvqshp,t1_fdtcwkp,1578750442.0,"One more thing to add here that's important. A lot of times we physically cant fix it because you booked through a third party. Our hands are completely tied, we cant change anything or give refunds no matter how much you yell at the front desk. You have to call and deal with expedia who doesnt give a shit about you instead of the actual human standing in front of you who would really like to help but can't. It's not a matter of us being difficult, we physically cant make changes to third party bookings in our computer."
AskReddit,fdvpabu,t1_fds4l49,1578749997.0,"I just posted above and OMG did I ever hate having to deal with them! Like I haven't worked at a hotel in years and I'm seeing red just remembering it. They used to keep booking rooms for people after we were sold out. I was the night auditor. Let me tell you how much fun that wasn't. They used to also tell them all kinds of lies about the hotel or just book ""a room"" with no specifications so a family of five would show up at midnight and all I have is one king room with a handicap shower left. And then we cant even refund them because it's through a third party. Good times."
AskReddit,fdvn6hn,t1_fdr8abr,1578749319.0,"I used to work at a hotel and they are a nightmare to deal with. They fuck up all the time and even sell rooms when we're sold out which is SUPER FUN to deal with when the people show up in the middle of the night with their confirmation. They screw up room types often too, like giving a family of five a single kind bed. If you insist on using them or any company that offers a similar service CALL THE HOTEL BEFORE YOU SHOW UP. Even if everything is fine theres no harm in taking two seconds just to make sure. Fixing their mistakes is super easy if you catch them early but impossible if you just show up and we have no other rooms left."
AskReddit,fdvm4su,t1_fdubg57,1578748897.0,There have been multiple occasions I was seriously considering joining PF because cheap and close but these stories are the reason I dont. It seems to be a universal experience with them and I just dont want to deal with that.

ChoosingBeggars,fcma7yr,t1_fclkl0t,1577768481.0,Next time you're looking you should ask if your library participates in any inter-library loan programs. If they do they can get it from another library that has it pretty quickly. I had a library that did that for me and it was awesome!

Their money is not in the do-it-yourselfers despite how they advertize. And if you spend enough for that line to actually matter you'll never say it because they sprinkle rose petals on the ground before you even walk in."
ChoosingBeggars,fcm93mm,t1_fcm72li,1577767547.0,This is exactly the reason they changed that policy. Now it's one year and if its past a year they'll still take it if it was defective. That's still pretty damn generous if you ask me.

ChoosingBeggars,fciywdn,t1_fcixffa,1577673148.0,Yeah that's where I would draw the line. There are plenty of other artists at her skill level and above that I would rather support financially.
ChoosingBeggars,fciynsq,t1_fciuoni,1577672984.0,"It's worth whatever it's worth to you. Tattoos are a very personal thing. If you really like the artist and are confident they can give you exactly what you want to see on your skin every day for the rest of your life, it's hard to put a price on that. FWIW this is on the high end, but we dont know who the artist is or what kind of work they put out so it could be reasonable."

If they're not doing something batshit insane they're trapping people in the left lane going 10 under for 30 miles of straight pristine road as 20 cars fly past on the right.
