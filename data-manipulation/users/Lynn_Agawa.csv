AskReddit,fewp3t9,t1_feui0f5,1579417360.0,"Something very similar happened to me but the worst part is that I wasn’t asleep, nor had I just woken up"
AskReddit,fekrrc9,t1_fekksjf,1579206249.0,"On the flip side, I used to be grounded from reading. Since it was all I ever wanted to do, it was the only thing that could be taken. 

My mom would make me pack up all my books in boxes. So I used to climb this big tree in my backyard and I would hide books up there by tying them with a skipping rope and a piece of tarp. 

So cue book grounding and being told to go play outside, I climb my tree with a big enough branch to sit and read in, and too many leaves to see me from the house."
AskReddit,fekrfex,t3_epll8l,1579206057.0,"Being able to drink milk.

I grew up poor. Milk is expensively and we were only limited to using it in cereal in the morning because there was 4 of us kids. 

If I went to a friends house and they drank a glass of milk I thought they were rich"
ttcafterloss,fecgb1g,t3_eoajj7,1578973218.0,"I’m not going to rush to test obsessively. From the day I got my first positive, to my miscarriage last week I obsessively tested multiple times a week to make sure it was still there. I had a gut feeling it wasn’t going to end well and it didn’t. 

Next time I’m not going to make it such a big deal for myself and not stress so hard about whether or not it’s going to work out because at the end of the day there is absolutely nothing that anybody could’ve done to prevent it. 

As cold as it sounds I think staying a bit more detached will help ease some stress, because the stress doesn’t help whatsoever. I took 30 pregnancy tests in a two week span obsessing over it. I don’t want to put myself through that again."

bulletjournal,fdkiegv,t1_fdkic6q,1578504456.0,Well shit. I bought it to use water colours on
bulletjournal,fdkho1c,t1_fdkhd2s,1578504073.0,"I’m a little disappointed, I waited almost a month and spent quite a bit because I’m in Canada only to get a wonky journal. I had very high expectations for this company because of their reputation"
bulletjournal,fdkdf1p,t3_elv3ep,1578501517.0,"I’ll also add that all of the pages are printed differently. Some are aligned, some aren’t. I’ve never had a square grid before so if someone could just tell me if this is normal before I order another one"
Midwives,fdh00ze,t1_fdgzm4r,1578412403.0,"My situation was pretty emergency, and then the next day I passed a huge clot that made the nurse nervous so she gave me another pretty strong massage. They were apologetic the whole time and they didn’t enjoy having to do it. They just had to make sure I was okay. I also had a really long labour so that probably contributed to my uterus being pretty sore. 

As much as it hurt, it was necessary and I’m thankful to them for saving my life."
vaginismus,fdgzpiy,t3_el0skt,1578412198.0,"I’m “cured” 4 years after my diagnosis. I believe that giving birth vaginally helped significantly and I can have pain free PIV and I don’t dilate anymore. I can’t orgasm from PIV but that’s not something that’s exclusive to vaginismus. There is sometimes mild pain in the beginning, and sometimes I have to stop. But those times are pretty rare"
Midwives,fdgyydr,t1_fdfwuop,1578411719.0,Honestly didn’t even think of this after I had my PPH. But those massages hurt so much I didn’t even want to touch the area
