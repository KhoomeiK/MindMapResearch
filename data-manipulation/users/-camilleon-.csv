There was no question that gays go to hell, it was just the truth. And I was told that questioning god’s word was a sin so to even wonder or research something like that would make god angry at me. Not all religious people grow up this way and not all churches are so wretched in their beliefs, but as an ex-Christian raised in the south, I wanted to give some insight as to why she may not have tried looking for other opinions on gay people when she was young. She was likely scared of god, her parents, her church and had no reason to question a lifetime of indoctrination."

Letting her parents pay her way through school isn’t the same as agreeing with what they did to her brother. She doesn’t have to ruin herself financially to apologize to her brother, she didn’t know she was doing anything wrong at the time and I don’t fault her for being an ignorant, brainwashed 13 year old who thought she was saving herself and her brother from an eternity of damnation. Kudos to her for going to college, realizing that the truths she grew up with aren’t actually the truth, and reaching out to her brother. Shame on anyone who believes she deserves the same treatment her brother got in order to settle some score or be worthy of his forgiveness. She didn’t do anything wrong, the psycho religious parents who sent their son to conversion therapy and then left him homeless and alone are the real fuck ups."

At 13, you absolutely do not have the knowledge required to form your own opinions and to assume that this child who was raised by parents who would kick out their teenage son and send him to conversion therapy would be the same parents that would let their daughter have access to progressive media is so naive. At 13, all she knew was that if she didn’t speak up, God would punish her and her brother with eternal damnation. Of course what she did was wrong, but she was a brainwashed 13 year old."

The people who are to blame for conversion therapy, homelessness, years of struggling are his parents. His parents were the adults who betrayed their son.

Sure you don’t have to make amends with your sister, but your friends are right, she was a child who was heavily indoctrinated into beliefs that are incredibly difficult to change. The only people that deserve your anger are your parents. To blame a child who genuinely believed that she was doing the right to thing instead of your adult parents who betrayed their own son is such a shitty thing to do. Your sister didn’t know. And yes her not realizing until she got to college that was she did was wrong makes a ton of sense. People that are raised in certain views won’t know that they can challenge those views until they’re educated.

Therefore, brake checking is in fact illegal. Sure you can’t prove that someone is brake checking you unless you have a dash cam, but it’s still illegal and still dangerous and you’re still missing my point. I agree, the lady is an asshole and a shitty driver, that doesn’t make what OP did ok. He’s a kid and he should learn quick that his actions and decisions while driving can be fatal. It’s very likely that there could have been another car in the road that the lady could’ve hit as a result of her bad driving and OP brake checking her. Again, two wrongs don’t make a right. What aren’t you getting? Don’t brake check other drivers. And yes, before you go and get your panties in a wad, don’t tailgate other drivers either."

I wouldn’t even consider it an asshole move so long as they left on the chance that the people that bought the seats came back. They were apologetic and OP came on way too strong.

I’d understand your judgement if it was ESH because you can make the argument that she’s stirring the pot, but she didn’t start this tension. Her boyfriend and his family are much bigger assholes here. Standing up for yourself is not giving into people like her boyfriend’s family. They want information they don’t deserve, so she’s choosing not to share it with them. She’s not an asshole for that. She’s just standing her ground."

For it to be as effective as possible, you have to take it at the exact same time, everyday, without any interference (like antibiotics) and even then it can still fail. Also why would you trust a stranger? Condoms are designed to protect for more than just unwanted pregnancies, you should never not use a condom with a stranger."
AmItheAsshole,fd78zuo,t1_fd76jag,1578201004.0,"I can’t make you a considerate person. You have to be able to think for yourself and understand other points of view. You’re right in that healthy and fulfilling relationships require communication, but this is an issue between birthday boy and his girlfriend, not Sarah and OP. You’re wrong in that she should’ve known they were going to surf. That’s not a natural assumption for many people. There are many things to do at the beach, but doing them alone when you want to be spending time with your boyfriend on his birthday doesn’t sound very enticing. She’s the victim of poor communication and being set up for failure. John should’ve made sure his girlfriend knew the plans, and regardless of whether it’s his birthday or not, if he was going to invite her then he should have been more considerate towards her feelings. If you can’t wrap you’re head around that then your username fits and there’s no point in engaging with you. And bringing up the point that she doesn’t like the beach has no place here, she doesn’t like the beach but she likes her boyfriend, that’s why she went."
AmItheAsshole,fd75q40,t1_fd74bl4,1578199776.0,You say that like she knew they were going to surf and wrestle all day. All she knew was that they were going to the beach.

AmItheAsshole,fd6ugmk,t1_fd3754k,1578195861.0,"We actually don’t know if she knew there were plans to surf, all we know is they had all agreed to spend the day at the beach. I’ve been to the beach 1000 times and never have I surfed, it’s totally understandable how someone wouldn’t assume this was apart of the plan. This whole thing reflects poorly on OP because he was continuously sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong. Any tension between Sarah and John is just that, between Sarah and John. OP shouldn’t be speaking for John or asking Sarah why she even came. Which for the record has an obvious answer: she wanted to spend the day with her boyfriend on his birthday."

AmItheAsshole,fd6s7m9,t1_fd683lx,1578195065.0,She wasn’t included though. Only doing activities that someone has openly expressed they’re not comfortable with and not compromising at all is excluding them.

AmItheAsshole,fd6porb,t3_ejwo11,1578194205.0,"YTA. Ok here’s the thing.. 2 hours IS a long time to leave someone all alone on the beach, and wrestling in the water and shit talking aren’t exactly universally fun, so while Sarah sounds like a bit of a drag, you sound like you overstepped and made her feel unwelcome and left out on her boyfriend’s birthday. It wasn’t your place to ask why she came. She came for the most obvious reason: it’s HER boyfriend’s birthday. We don’t know so many things about their relationship, what if she wanted to take him to dinner, what if she wanted to have a private celebration, what if she was actually perfectly happy going to the beach until she realized that she was going to spend the entire time alone while you guys DID in fact exclude her? And yes, if you’re only doing activities that someone openly dislikes, they’re not excluding themselves, you’re being exclusive. It was Johns birthday and it really should be about him and what he wants, but you keep saying things like, “we told her no,” and “I asked her why she even came,” which are things that only John should be asking her if he’s concerned about it. It’s totally plausible that you overstepping and giving your opinion every time Sarah directed a question at John put pressure on him. I feel bad for Sarah, just because it’s John’s bday doesn’t make it cool to leave her alone on the beach for 2 hours and then come back and exclude her some more when all she probably wanted to do was spend time with the person she loves on his birthday."
memes,fd5yeiy,t1_fd56rdc,1578183069.0,"Honestly so tired of all these memes where the punch line is just fEmInIsM bAd, 99% of them completely miss what feminism is about anyways. Like the whole equal rights equal fights meme trend right now, feminists would agree but generally just believe no one should be violent towards anyone. If a feminist complains about a man defending himself from a woman who’s being violent towards him, then he/she is not a true feminist. Feminism is about equality, not female superiority."

People insisting that OP is doing everyone a favor assumes that his colleagues wanted to go to this conference. It sounds like the other employees didn’t get a choice between not going at all or going in OP’s car that in all honestly just doesn’t sound very comfortable. Tim is an asshole for the non-stop complaining, but for OP to dismiss any criticism of his car because he likes it is also not cool. Plenty of people would be upset if they were forced to go on an extended work trip by way of a beat up stinky car. That’s valid."

I know that my experience alone isn’t representative of the rest of the population but crashing at someone’s house generally means in and out, therefore sleeping till 11:30 and making your host wait to start their day till you finally wake up is clearly overstaying your welcome. I think the verdict would be different if it was just BIL spending the night, but he brought a stranger to you in to your home and seeing as he has been dating around recently, you don’t know how long he’s known this woman that’s sleeping in your house. I wouldn’t hold it against anyone to not feel comfortable leaving a stranger in their home even if they’re with your BIL. Because of the circumstances, I truly feel like you’re NTA because I would assume that a grown man would understand what “crashing” implies. Also you mentioned they were there by 11:30, let’s assume they went to bed around 1, being awake by 8 or 9 is incredibly reasonable, people here are acting like you need 12 hours of sleep to function.

Teaching his son that physical violence will get him rewarded is super messed up. I don’t think he should be punished of course, all he did was stand up himself, but to reward him for a week after?

college,fcgjr2a,t3_eh6uwt,1577640925.0,"This was exactly my situation for my entire first year. It wasn’t until my second year where I really started to enjoy my social life at school. I’d give it more time before seriously considering transferring. All of my good friends I ended up meeting through work, not school. I know it sounds cliche but seriously consider getting involved in clubs/work/anything that involves participating in a small, close knit group. I don’t know anyone who met their best friend in class."
AmItheAsshole,fcgb9dq,t1_fcg7pe1,1577638292.0,"It is hiding stuff, he said it himself this relationship is serious and they have a child together, his finances affect their child as do hers and to be hesitant to share this kind of info indicates some distrust in their relationship. Just because you’ve had long term relationships where you chose not to be open about finances doesn’t mean OP isn’t an asshole for hiding this from his SO in this particular situation. But again, this is less about the money and more about the principle. Relationships should be transparent."
AmItheAsshole,fcg5x1p,t1_fcg2efz,1577636788.0,"This has nothing to do with my point: you shouldn’t lie or withhold information in a long term relationship. I understand how taxes work and I understand how joint finances work, I don’t understand how anyone could feel comfortable in a long term relationship withholding this kind of information. Again, I’m not saying she’s entitled to his money. I’m saying she deserves to know he has it in order to maintain a transparent relationship. When I made my comment about them being on the same page as each other for their joint financial future, I meant that in terms of the future, should they ever get married/ recognized by the state as a couple.  I understand the legal implications tied to marriage, that has nothing to do with whether or not you’re an asshole for hiding stuff from your long term partner. People getting hung up on labels and saying she deserves to know nothing because she’s not his wife are my issue here."
AmItheAsshole,fcfvuy8,t1_fcfuvqo,1577634241.0,"It’s not about his “rights,” people here get fixated on who’s in the wrong and who’s in the right and forget that this is AITA. He can choose to do whatever the fuck he wants to do, but by hiding this from his long term partner, he’s being an asshole. Most people would want to be in a relationship with someone they trust and that trusts them."
AmItheAsshole,fcfpcbq,t1_fcfm5jp,1577632446.0,"You’ve missed my point entirely. No where did I say she has a right to his inheritance, I said that he should be open and honest because they’re in a long term relationship and the fact that they’re not married is irrelevant. Saying someone’s long term relationship is invalid until marriage is so narrow minded and wrong. She’s not some fling, she’s his long term partner and mother of his child. He’s definitely an asshole for not being honest with her."
AmItheAsshole,fcfi8ih,t1_fcf2yvr,1577630245.0,"She’s not some random bitch he hates, she’s the mother of his child. Her future affects his child’s future. Not saying he should pay for her college, I just think it’s wild to assume their relationship is going to end in flames when none of us have any understanding of their relationship."
AmItheAsshole,fcfgzjm,t1_fcesule,1577629811.0,"You’re assuming this is just some casual relationship because they’re not married. People can be in strong, healthy, fully committed relationships without ever being married. Just being she isn’t his wife has literally nothing to do with the fact that relationships depend on honesty and transparency."
AmItheAsshole,fcfgk03,t1_fcf8w71,1577629698.0,"That’s not what most people here are implying. They’re saying in a committed relationship, you should be able to be honest and upfront about your joint financial future."
AmItheAsshole,fcfffck,t1_fcdg88q,1577629434.0,"This! I’m shocked by all the NTA. People assume if you’re not married that your relationship isn’t valid. They’re in a committed relationship with a child and while it’s not her money, she deserves honestly and transparency. Why date someone you can’t trust? As for her dad, OP either needs to learn how to say “no” or just not tell the dad about the money."
AmItheAsshole,fcakhte,t3_egtqdl,1577570979.0,"Huge YTA. The socks aren’t even the important part of this mess, it’s the fact that after a year you’re still treating this girl like some one night stand your son dragged to Christmas that makes you an asshole."
college,fcadgl9,t3_egv4m4,1577567337.0,You have to just be upfront and honest. Nothing will change if you don’t communicate.
unpopularopinion,fc92u09,t1_fc7c7wj,1577546124.0,"It is a good rule, anyone who disagrees is naive. Where I work we have a rule of three. No adult and child can be alone, there always needs to be two adults or two children. In the end the rule protects both the child and the adult because it prevents the child from getting hurt and prevents the adult from being falsely accused of anything."
AmItheAsshole,fc8vfuw,t1_fc74zkf,1577542650.0,"Yes, a simple, “hey I really appreciate what you guys are doing but I don’t need my car today and I’m feeling really sick right now so I can’t offer my help, I’d prefer to just handle it myself when I feel better, thank you!” would have fixed the problem."
AmItheAsshole,fc78zef,t3_eggx3b,1577500694.0,"Huge NTA and your husband sucks. I’m so sorry this was your Christmas experience this year. I hope he realizes how shitty he’s being both for saying you killed the spirit and for not getting you anything meaningful after you put so much effort into Christmas and I hope next year he makes it up to you. If you want to be super petty, let him handle all of Christmas next year and then gift him an unwrapped phone charger."
AmItheAsshole,fc73vtn,t1_fc667u0,1577496844.0,"I wish we could actually get an answer to this question. Yes cheating is so shitty, everyone knows and agrees to this. But dangling that over someone’s head for the rest of their life after agreeing to work through it and move on is also shitty. Don’t date people you don’t trust and don’t have kids with people you don’t trust. That should just be a given."
AmItheAsshole,fc71ji1,t3_ega559,1577495062.0,"Man I’m gonna get downvoted but I really don’t think you’re an asshole. You’re allowed to be annoyed that you feel second to his parents, and I think to literally get you nothing for Christmas is lame but definitely not intentionally malicious. A two week trip to Spain when you’re tight on money is the kind of “poor” I aspire to be though. NAH."
AmItheAsshole,fc35nu0,t1_fc2qy6t,1577382050.0,"Rejection is a part of life, and yes even getting bullied is apart of life sometimes. Not everyone is going to like you and not everyone is going to be nice to you, demanding that everyone treat your kid like the angel you see her as will make her life infinitely harder down the road. Also, calling middle schoolers bitches? How low, pathetic, and embarrassing. You sound like the only bully here."
