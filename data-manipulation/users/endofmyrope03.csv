SuicideWatch,ff673nm,t3_erq9gd,1579620699.0,I really don't like people saying that. Especially because mostly they don't know what situation the other is in . It's so dismissive and condescending

SuicideWatch,fdkswxp,t3_elwy13,1578510478.0,They are useless. Ask the same stock questions. I've tried a few hotlines. This sub is more useful. Atleast here there are people who are going through or been thru the same issues. Sometimes it just helps to be understood
