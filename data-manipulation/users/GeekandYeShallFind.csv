I do really enjoy seeing the various stones on this sub, especially the ones in cuts I’ve never seen before (there was one that looked like a star... I’m not even sure how to describe it but I thought it was amazing). 

How do you all find your vendors?"
Shinypreciousgems,ffi5bbt,t3_eto5bq,1579965480.0,"I have a question. I LOVE the stuff I see on this sub, but I’m wary about purchasing something unseen. I know from  picking out engagement rings/also looking at Colombian emeralds a tiny something about about what goes into the price of gems (cut, color, clarity). But is there a resource I can read, a way to evaluate pricing on some of the different stones that come up on here? Some folks have talked about whether a stone has been oiled or irradiated?"

Shinypreciousgems,feb8e27,t1_feazz5p,1578956346.0,That’s gorgeous. What do you mean by special occasion ring? Does that mean the stone is fragile?
HIMYM,fdwkcn5,t1_fdvp602,1578759609.0,"Yes. The show invested many, many seasons in showing us that Ted and Robin are a train wreck together. It also shows us that people change and grow apart. Even when Ted and Robin get what they want, the show reverses itself and shows us that Ted grew and changed to be the person he needed to be for Tracy, but that just kidding, all that change meant nothing when it came to Robin."
HIMYM,fdwjoh9,t1_fdvax6s,1578759439.0,"My problem is that this reduces Tracy down to a means to an end which Ted achieves. When she fulfills her role, the show essentially discards her. The show builds her up as Ted’s perfect match but there is little payoff for the viewer, and when he re-returns to Robin, we are sort of left questioning whether she was his perfect match all along, and what was Tracy’s actual role in Ted’s life?"

AskReddit,fceti47,t1_fcc3gmr,1577623613.0,"Not sherry, sherry vinegar. It’s quite tart, so just a little splash so you still have the sweetness from the maple syrup, just balanced out a little bit with some acidity."
