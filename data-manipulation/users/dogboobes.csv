TrollXChromosomes,ffd9s24,t1_ffcdcep,1579816226.0,"Oh totally. The same men telling women to ""take responsibility"" for getting pregnant are the ones refusing to wear condoms or take any ownership over reproduction whatsoever.

TooAfraidToAsk,fdiqer9,t3_elio68,1578448708.0,"I honestly think it comes down to 2 things:

1. These people can't realistically fathom what a billion dollars looks like. They have no sense of scale. If they did, they would see how NO ONE should be a billionaire. And the existence of billionaires is evidence of something very broken. [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoK38U8gDU)
2. Particularly in the US, people \~look up to billionaires as the epitome of the ""American Dream"" without realizing that, in order to become a billionaire, you have to grossly exploit thousands of people and their labor. It doesn't happen in a vacuum. Jeff Bezos isn't a billionaire while his Amazon factory workers make bottom dollar for backbreaking work. He's a billionaire BECAUSE his Amazon factory workers make bottom dollar for backbreaking work."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdipgpk,t1_fdiaxk4,1578448105.0,Agreed.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdimplc,t1_fdijxtg,1578446347.0,Specifically billionaires. There are no ethical billionaires.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdimo4t,t1_fdi74i3,1578446320.0,"Agreed. But when it comes to billionaires and not just your day-to-day rich person, I think we have to accept that they ARE bad. There is no way to become a billionaire without fucking over tons of other people."

MorbidReality,fdi85yu,t1_fdi133f,1578437456.0,"No, ""willing"" and ""consent"" are different words. Regardless, there is no 4-year-old in the entire world who eagerly and readily wants sex with a fucking old pedophile. And there sure as hell isn't a 4-year-old initiating sex with a pedophile.
