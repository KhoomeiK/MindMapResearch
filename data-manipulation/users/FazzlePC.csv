offmychest,fgpyjt1,t3_ezj5ga,1581014465.0,"I can't even begin to imagine the amount of crap that he has had to deal with his whole life that has fostered such self-hatred. My heart goes out to him. In times like this, you have to be his pillar. Remind him everyday about his strengths, about how much he has turned his life around. Remind him about how much he is loved. Being black is a part of him and his identity and he wouldn't be him if he wasn't. (I say this as someone who is also a minority race.)

In our society, there will always be people who spread hate for no reason. It is through this strife and hopelessness where courage and strength is borne. Tell him to stand tall and be proud of who he is. You should never be upset at the things that other people say, unless you know yourself that they are correct/true."

Christianity,fgpb20p,t3_ezsqtm,1581001096.0,"Firstly, I am very sorry for your loss. I know this will be difficult, so stay strong and don't be afraid to lean onto God for courage and comfort.

Secondly, PLEASE talk to your wife. You may not have been the person carrying the foetus, but you are still as much a part of the process and you need to be able to support one another and grieve together. The more you let the distance stay between you two, you will feel isolated and resentment may grow without you two being aware. Talk, listen, cry, pray, and hope together."
todayilearned,fgpaml3,t3_ezi9i0,1581000818.0,"As with everything in life, a lot of it comes down to your background.

My mom came from a relatively poorer family, so growing up, she had to bum food off her neighbours. It wasn't as charitable as it sounds (the neighbour kids would spit on the leftovers and throw it on the floor needlessly for my mom and her siblings to eat). Once she married my dad (who came from a reasonably well-to-do family), food became easily accessible and she was OBSESSED with filling the house with food. No one was to be left hungry on her watch and needless to say, my siblings and I were well fed. 

While this was all good and well, we naturally became quite overweight when we were in our teens. (I mean, it didn't get to such an extreme because we were also doing alot of sports, but anyway.) Now that we're adults, we are the ones counting calories and telling our mom not to buy or order too much, but habits are hard to break, I suppose. She now laments stuffing us with food when we were young, but honestly, I'm just grateful because I can't imagine what life is like for those who have to constantly worry about their next meal.

Anyway, not very relevant to the thread, but just a  story that I thought I would share. Cheers."

For instance, my main reservation for having kids is because of my fears of having to bring up a child in the kind of society that we live in at present. For instance, how do you protect your children adequately while they are still vulnerable, but at the same time allow them to make mistakes and learn from them?"

Christianity,ffwf33j,t1_ffvag50,1580298613.0,"Hey man, I totally get where you're coming from. Alot of the churches that I've been to have become mired by politics, worshipping of human pastors, and cliques/manufactured friendships. It's the biggest part about why I've stepped away from the church and focused on my own relationship with God.

While community and fellowships is great and all, the routine of going for service or bible study once a week kind of makes you adopt the mind-set of ""I've done my mandatory Christian hours of the week. So, I will go about the rest of my week forgetting about God until the next time I attend church."" Without this so-called safety net, the onus is on you to have God in your life everyday."

askscience,ffhux60,t1_ffh4yrz,1579955070.0,"Depends on your country's reaction time and efficiency in identifying those with the condition and quarantining them appropriately for treatment. If you work at or visit a healthcare setting quite often, you have a higher likelihood of catching it as that is where most affected individuals will present or be concentrated in. 

To make a long story short, don't visit hospitals unless you absolutely have to, and if you do, always wash/sanitize your hands as often as possible. If you want to go all out, wear a mask, I suppose. Otherwise, unless you personally have travelled to Wu Han, or are in close contacts with people who have done so, your chances of contracting the virus are quite low."

I don't think it's radical to stop all flights coming in and leaving from China. Their stupidity and corruption will be their eventual downfall. Just leave the rest of us out of it.

Edit: I reread my comment and I realise that it was abit harsh. A whole country shouldn't be blamed for the actions of a corrupt and foolish few. I'm glad that the relevant authorities have taken relatively faster steps to quell the spread of the virus and inform other countries on the danger and how to identify the strain. Just hope everyone stays safe and that this passes quickly and with no more casualties."

AskReddit,ff0ml0s,t3_eqt3lg,1579470265.0,"Not really an example, but I sort of understand the feeling of why older generations may be reluctant or have avoided using newer technology. It's probably a combination of comfort and fear of the new/different. I mean, consider this. Imagine that your handy-dandy all-purpose smartphone got replaced by what, an in-built device in your brain in the future. Sure, it may be convenient as you no longer have to lug a phone around and everything is voice/thought-controlled, but I for one would be kind of resistant to switching to it while the then current generation may see it as the epitome of convenience and entertainment.
