clothdiaps,ffn1dd5,t1_ffmejzj,1580060999.0,"Every newborn is different, so mostly through trial and error! For example, my friend’s kiddo was fine overnight with one extra bamboo insert in a pocket diaper. For my kid, that was laughable, and what he needs for *every* diaper change, and our overnight fitteds probably have 6 total inserts! And her kid is 6 months older than mine lol. 

I’d start with one and see if that works. If it doesn’t, double up!"
clothdiaps,ffmgrk1,t1_ffm08x3,1580054427.0,"To my understanding, prefolds are a bit like baby origami. You fold them around baby, then can use a snappi to hold it in place before you put the cover on overtop. There are several different fold options (yes, some are easy and don’t require a snappi, but to someone not used to this it is overwhelming). I don’t know how well you can prep ahead of time, unless you are just laying the prefold in the cover more like an AI2? But even then, changing the baby will require them to toss the soiled prefold and potentially reuse the cover and use a new prefold where they start from scratch on how to get it on baby. 

With pockets, you stuff, and the caretaker sees nothing except the diaper. They take it off and out on a new one, and don’t need to worry about layers or flaps or folding or what is inside."
clothdiaps,ffk8703,t3_eu2dgn,1580018556.0,"You don’t have to go all in on one. I’d recommend having a few pocket diapers around as well. You can use your prefolds and stick them in the pocket as an insert and use both systems as you please. I think pockets will be much easier for any other caretakers to understand, as you can have the diaper prepped ahead of time and just stick it on the baby and go, and same when taking it off. 

AIOs are more like pockets, but rather than adding an insert or absorbent material, it’s already sewn in. This is closest to disposables, as you treat it essentially the same as one, except you wash them instead of throw them out."
BabyBumps,ffk58bb,t3_eu2fmo,1580016267.0,"I’ll be honest that a lot of these things are going to be true. However, they are not all permanent. I feel like most of the crying, sleeplessness, and sense of being overwhelmed starts to gradually taper off around four months. In the grand scheme of things, this is a very small blip over the course of your life and your child’s life. 

I won’t lie, my kiddo is 17 months and it’s still challenging, but also much more enjoyable and many more moments during the day that make it all feel “worth it.” I never question my friends who are child free, ever. If you aren’t all in, for sure, don’t be in! But I don’t ever question that it wasn’t the right choice for me in my life (not anymore..:but I definitely did during the first few months there!)."
beyondthebump,ffjyagd,t3_eu0wj0,1580010286.0,"I downloaded the Sesame Street app and play celebrity songs during diaper changes now. We don’t have the tv on hardly ever and don’t do screens for anything else, but for diaper changes, it is so worth having a mostly limp baby for 2 minutes."

clothdiaps,ffjuna6,t3_ety0df,1580007415.0,"My best advice is to get 3 or so of a few different kinds to see what you like! I was die hard AIOs (all in ones, where everything is sewn in to the diaper, so no stuffing required), but found my kid to be a super heavy wetter after a year old, and they just didn’t hold up to him anymore and I had to start stuffing them or adding extra inserts anyway. I learned it is much harder to add inserts to AIOs than it is to add an extra insert into a pocket diaper more designed for this! So starting at 14 or so months, I’ve become a fan of pockets! 

I’ve also gained appreciation for fitted diapers during our journey too; we love them for sleep since our guy tends to sleep on his belly and would leak even out of disposables...but the fitted, even over a disposable, keeps that leak in! 

For brands, I will say that price does not necessarily equal quality. I’ve been very disappointed with Bumgenius AIOs and Thirties AIOs for how much they cost ($20 each new). I dropped them like an old habit and got rid of the majority that I had, and now only have maybe three remaining that I use as last resort after selling off a dozen or so. 

Brands I do like: 
-Alva (very affordable for the price, though not the easiest pockets to stuff...their fitteds are great though with an added insert or two or over a disposable, and their covers are also affordable and work well),

-Happy Flute (their hemp AIOs are hands down my favorite, as they haven’t needed any extra boosting and are nice and trim! Hard to find though)

-Mama Koalas pockets (such wide pocket makes it super easy to stuff, and they stay nice and trim!)

-“Lovemy” brand inserts, found on amazon, 12 for $24. They work wonderfully. 

-Thirsties hemp inserts

-hemp/cotton blends in general are fantastic! 

I hope this was more helpful than overwhelming! But dabble a bit in everything, watch YouTube videos, and give them a try! And no worries if you don’t start until baby is four months old, when you start to feel more “normal” again!"

BabyBumps,ffjsxvp,t3_etv4yw,1580006084.0,"My guy was born at 6lbs 4 oz and we had almost no newborn stuff at all, which ended up being a mistake. My husband’s coworkers fortunately got him a six pack of NB onsies, and we wore the crap out of those! 

NB sizes diapers fit up until 10lbs, so a decent sized box of those should be fine; they go through like 10 a day, so even if you used them for a week, you’d need like 70. I would stock up more on size 1 diapers, as they will be in those for a few months and still use 10 a day, but they don’t start fitting until 8lbs. We didn’t use them at all in the first month, but as I said, my guy was on the smaller side.

Between 20-30 months is supposedly ideal, where it should take a few weeks at that point and come easily to the child; they also can communicate a great deal better. I’ve read that you *can* attempt earlier, but it will be a few months of process, and much longer in the “clueless” phase where they simply do not understand that they are peeing, let alone that it needs to go in the toilet.

Of those two, the collie will be calmer/lower energy, but a bit more vocal if you don’t mind that. Both are wary of strangers and will likely bark at them, but aren’t going to be a liability and actually attack someone (which is what you want, trust me). 

Other spaniels, like a cocker or English cocker or springer spaniel could also be good fits. If you want to go smaller, the cavalier King Charles spaniel is the ultimate companion dog, but they are much smaller and are very docile, not likely to bark or threaten anyone.

Edit: we cloth diaper too. Some additional accessories you can ask for I’ve found value in: Earth Mamma Diaper Balm (works great with cloth or disposables), disposable bamboo liners, aquaphor (can be used if you have a liner to protect diaper, and it helps SO much with any type of rash or irritation), Tide laundry detergent, regular bleach, an extra laundry basket and/or laundry hamper for baby, Thirsties Hemp Inserts, ubbi diaper pail, additional wet bags (we have 2 big and 2 small), Grovia bubble tabs (super easy diaper stripping) and some OS fitted diapers and covers.

That said, if a rabbit took off in front of him, I think it would be a crazy uphill battle to teach the dog to come back, or not panic about the feeling in their neck. These are not smart dogs, and they are super sensitive. I tried using the ecollar on my overly attached hound, and he’d go from not feeling it to whimpering and shutting down (we’re talking level 2-3 on a mini educator, where my Dobermans working level is 6-8). He’d simply lay down and not do anything else. He ignored high value food when I tried to condition “tingle = yummy food!” 

I’m not saying it’s impossible, but it is really, really hard. I’ve found it to be like e collar training a cat or other animal that just doesn’t have the mentality of listening to or working with a handler.

The way I see it, we actually aren’t all that good at reproducing. We have evolved to have really big developed brains (and that’s why we give birth to more under developed babies compared to a lot of mammals, whose babies come out equivalent to our 4 month olds). Remember how many people used to die giving birth? Back in the day it was more than likely going to be your cause of death if you were a woman, I expect because tearing and bleeding out was super common then too. I guess just be thankful the doctor can try to mitigate it a bit more and have the ability to usually stop bleeding and prevent infections or mitigate major tears."

We just weaned to milk and just stopped offering it as a bottle option at 12ish months. He ate enough regular food that he didn’t miss it. FWIW, we still do a bottle of cow milk before bed, but are planning on dropping that in the next month or so. Otherwise, no other bottles and milk/water are only offered in sippy cups during the day. He still refuses milk from a sippy cup for the most part, but, as I said, he doesn’t miss it. It was a lot less painful than I thought it would be!"
BabyBumps,feujkg9,t1_fetuxi8,1579387144.0,"This sounds like the best advice. Honestly OP, a c section is not any easier, and recovery is often longer and harder. I mean no ill will to anyone who has gone the c section route, but I’d be willing to bet they’d say it’s still hard and recovery is still gross and traumatic. You’ll still bleed a ton through your vagina post c section, and with the added additional pain of not being able to lift things or climb a lot of stairs. 

Everyone is different, but for me, my vaginal birth with an epidural was so easy, I’d honestly have a baby every week if that’s all it was. The poop I had a week later was soooooo much worse than actual delivery, and I felt a ton more pressure and pain and threat of tearing! 

Anyway, therapy sounds like the best step, as well as full education about c sections and vaginal birth. We all wish we could go to sleep and magically wake up with a baby with no memory or pain or recovery, but that’s not real life. Get the full real image of whatever you decide and start learning coping mechanisms now while you gear up for motherhood."
BabyBumps,feuhai5,t3_eqnazf,1579386568.0,"We started signing around 4 months. We checked out several books at the library; I can’t recall which specifically I liked, but the ones I did read said signing can have a significant impact long term and is well worth doing. IMO it’s easy to do and gives your child the gift of connecting dots and language even sooner than non signers, and if nothing else, relieves a lot of frustration for him in that he can communicate his needs and wants. 

My kiddo is 17 months and just now staring to try to say words, but can sign with ease in the meantime. In particular, he signs: help, eat, water, daddy, bunny, kitty, grandma, berry, milk, cracker, apple, book, etc. I feel like it’s once of the best things I’ve done for him!"

I’m hoping that once we do potty training we can stick with this and just decrease the number of inserts so he “feels” wet, but it doesn’t get all over everything. 

Alva baby makes $7 fitteds. They won’t likely hold up on their own, but can do it with added inserts. 

Idk, for that price (and you’d need at least two and wash every day) I’d probably just do pull-ups at that point. You should only need them for a few months!"

They are overkill for a lot of dogs, but NOT your average dobie. Introducing an ecollar was the most important life change we made, as it allows the dog to run as much as he wants, while also being an incredible enforcer for behavior, which, IMO is what a Doberman needs since they like to push ALL the buttons. It offers a non negotiable and consistent feedback. HIGHLY recommend looking into this, as well as an in person trainer that specializes in low level ecollar training.

In short, it’s all or nothing from the get go, and doing a gradual introduction to the potty tends to create a casual approach from the child, and tends to result in what you are experiencing. She does the first block naked, until the child learns what it feels like to pee/poo, then once they know that, moving on to pants but no underwear. According to her, standing up is a no no and confusing and messy, as is underwear and not being consistent with diapers vs no diapers (and pull ups are diapers). She doesn’t have them sit until they go, but rather learn what it feels like to pee and try to make it to the toilet once they know that feeling. 

Anyway, I’d really just read it. It’s easy to follow and concrete to understand. It sounds like your kiddo needs some solid structure and clear yes/nos rather than what is reading like some missed connections."

The amount of “swinging” you do is not intuitive (at least wasn’t for me) and is more like a fast jiggle. The white noise needs to be quite loud, like loud enough that you’d struggle to talk over it, and the swaddle needs to be snug (if too loose, they tend to get even angrier; the sweet pea swaddle makes it totally brainless and easy; highly recommend!).

The same company also makes “super duper chicken nuggets” which are also low sodium, high quality breast meat, and also have a vegetable based breading, and kiddo also loves these.
