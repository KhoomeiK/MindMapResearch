I had severe depression at one point and thankfully I told my doctor and although the recovery has been long I am finding life enjoyable again. 

Whats the worst that would happen if you told your parents? Probably not worse than if you dont."
TeenageSuicideWatch,ffhh4ia,t3_etncso,1579934998.0,"Have you asked either your parents or a trusted teacher about speaking to a professional? They may be able to recommend you take some time out of school if school is the root cause of you feeling like this. 

School is hard, stressful and as someone who also went to a private school I know the pressure can be really bad at times. All I can say is that life does get better and it is worth sticking life out for that alone. 

I hope things will improve for you, but hard as it may be you need to take the first step and ask for help - I realise that it will be difficult but it will be so worth it."

To add onto the post below which the cited a paper on the topic of oxycodone blood levels:

140 ng/mL is higher than what would be expected for someone taking oxycodone as directed by a doctor, but not by much. 
The expected level would be 10-100 ng/mL. 


140 ng/mL is FAR lower than what is found in suicide by oxycodone overdose but not far off what is found in mixed drug overdoses where the person is relying on a fatal combination of drugs. 


If oxycodone was the only drug in your brother’s system;

140 ng/mL suggests that your brother did not intend to take his own life and that his death was a tragic accident. 

140 ng/mL says that this was either a first experiment or a cry for help gone wrong."

Health,fetw8it,t1_fehrbaz,1579380637.0,"If you look into the drug discovery process, you’ll find that its long and expensive for a reason. 
A molecule that is discovered to stop tumour growth also needs to not stop normal cell growth, not cause blood clots, or interfere with ion channels that lead to heart problems, not be broken down immediately in the liver, not be removed immediately by the kidneys, not get broken down into a toxic metabolite, not dissolve to slowly if its in a pill, not cause literally one of a million things that could lead to severe side effects. 
Then you have to work out how to make it on large scale… simply scaling up what you did in the lab by 10000x will not work and every contaminant has to go through all the same biological tests as the drug itself to make sure the 0.01% contaminant isn’t a potent carcinogen and give patients cancer. 

There are a lot of things I’ve left out and glossed over but you get the point. Drug discovery is mindbogglingly complex if you don’t want to kill your patients."

mantids,fep0myu,t3_eq99ot,1579309494.0,"I’ve seen many insects preserved in resin blocks for display, you’d need a vacuum pump to remove air from the resin before you cast it so it may be somewhat pricey unless you can take your mantis to someone with the kit to do it.

AskDrugNerds,fek6wt4,t3_epc94i,1579193868.0,"I think (stretching my memory here) that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like amitriptyline are considered more efficacious than SSRIs and this paper may provide part of an explanation. TCAs are far more toxic in overdose though hence why they are not a first line treatment in the UK at least. 
Similarly MAO inhibitors are more efficacious but have serious interactions with drugs and food so are reserved for specialist use by psychiatrists. 


Prescribing a treatment involves a risk/benefit analysis. 
Do I give the depressed patient with a self harm risk a drug that might kill him in overdose but might help him, or a drug that will definitely kill him in overdose but will probably help him?? 
You’d probably want to try him on the “might kill him” before the “will kill him”."
AskDrugNerds,fek5y94,t1_fejsta6,1579193298.0,"“Growing evidence suggests that both the major drug therapies for anxiety disorder, the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and behavioral treatments based in exposure therapies, act through improving extinction of aversive experiences. One would predict, therefore, that the BDNF Met allele would be associated with poor response to these treatments. We have demonstrated that SSRIs are ineffective in reducing anxiety in BDNF Met mice, predicting that nonresponsive humans may form a biologically meaningful subcategory of anxiety-disordered individuals that may relate to the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (Chen and others 2006).“

Thats from the ‘future directions’ part of the paper. Admittedly I skimmed the paper but I have no idea how the authors come to that conclusion."

pharmacy,fegy336,t3_eoy0si,1579105093.0,"I don’t think it’s unpopular among healthcare professionals, sure there would be a debate if a blanket ban on all benzos seeing as many still have important indications but certainly their addiction and abuse potential is very high. 

This is me talking as a medicinal chemist, I’m sure a UK pharmacist would likely agree. 

Here in the UK benzos and Z drugs are prescribed very cautiously. I have bouts of severe insomnia and even though my GP knows that I know the risks etc. she is still hesitant to give me zolpidem because of the amount of people addicted to benzos and Z drugs alike. 

I also think that many GPs have accepted that some elderly patients are hopelessly addicted and there is more risk than benefit of trying to wean them off at this point in their life - but I know a few people who get their fix from granny so maybe it is time to become stricter on how much is given how frequently."

I would be curious as to how much of his wealth he’d actually be willing to pay as taxes and not see exactly where it goes as opposed to being able to do his own humanitarian pursuits like the his and Melinda’s foundation. 

Perhaps the super wealthy should be required to create and fund humanitarian companies - they can directly see where their money is going and I would think having that choice of where it goes would make them more receptive of the idea.
