If you can afford it, there's a book he sells called Total Cat Mojo. I've been reading it and there's so much good info in there :). If you need/want any tips about introducing them if you end up getting a second kitty feel free to inbox me! It was a little stressful but so worth it. Our first cat missed us when we went to work but he likes his buddy"
cats,feg3okh,t1_fefxff9,1579075507.0,We just recently adopted a 14 week old kitten to become buddies with our 2 year old cat. We followed Jackson Galaxy's tips on introduction and after 4 days they were best of friends
AskReddit,febmmt9,t1_feb216h,1578960466.0,A couple years ago I was in the UK during one of your summers (I'm Australian). It was so hot and when I got back to where I was staying I asked how to turn the air conditioner on. They just looked at me blankly.
AskVet,febm910,t1_febm0sa,1578960305.0,"Thanks for the info! We have kitten wet food and kitten biscuits, he has worked out how to get to the other cats adult biscuits but I'm pretty sure he doesn't eat the older cats wet food. They also get a bit of fresh chicken and tuna every other day, does that sound okay?"
cats,fe1wlte,t1_fe1we6p,1578831744.0,"Nope, just friendly taps when they chase each other down the hall lol"
cats,fe1vz3o,t1_fe1vr0a,1578831550.0,"Oh well that's a relief. I've never had 2 cats at once, so I'm not sure what's normal, or whats a potential issue"
cats,fe1vctn,t1_fe1v84n,1578831272.0,"You're probably right. I seem to be overthinking every interaction, just wanting them both to be okay. At this minute they are both sleeping on the couch next to each other, kitten reached out and touched cat. Cat didn't react"
cats,fe1umyr,t1_fe1uiiy,1578831080.0,"Kittens bowl is in a seperate room, older cats biscuits are on his tree, however kitten can get to them. Maybe it might be worth putting cats biscuits up higher?"
cats,fe1ui9i,t1_fe1u1o5,1578831025.0,"We feed them separately and supervise for their wet food, however we leave biscuits out for them during the day. Our older cat is reasonably good with the kitten, hasn't really hissed or growled at him apart from once at food time"
