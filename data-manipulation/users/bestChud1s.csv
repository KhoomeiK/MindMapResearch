The deaths were the result of too many people being relocated to industrial communes, whereas the Holocaust was for the express purpose of killing jews, gypsies, and other ""inferior"" races. Stalin's five year plan led to 6-7 million dying from starvation, and many more dying from other causes. Stalin of course, also killed with the purpose of killing (such as with Holodomor) but nothing was like the Holocaust in terms of killing with the main reason being to kill."
