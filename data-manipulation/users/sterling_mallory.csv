dataisbeautiful,ffsx311,t1_ffswlfk,1580196033.0,"I may have been unclear on ""bunching"" since the paper is about amounts being raised to meet the threshold for a longer sentence.

The only case I've seen cited was from someone else's work wherein two people were caught with 1 and 4 grams of heroin, respectively, but the prosecutors could use informant testimony to charge them with a larger amount. That case did involve more than one person, but that scenario could be applied to a single person as well."

Right.

As for the followup, the author does point to data that shows that ""bunching"" occurs at a disproportionately higher rate to blacks and Hispanics than whites. He didn't mention gang activity, probably because that's not concrete data to cite. It probably plays some part, if I was to hazard a guess."
dataisbeautiful,ffsvwuz,t1_ffsvv84,1580194602.0,"Second, **prosecutors can influence drug amounts because mandatory minimum sentencing is deter-
mined by the amount of drugs the offender is responsible for trafficking, which is not strictly based on
the amount of drugs they are holding** at the time of arrest (Honold 2014; USSC 2015b; Lynch 2016).
For one, prosecutors can rely on the testimony of informants or law enforcement to establish “historical
weight,” the amount of drugs a defendant is responsible for outside of the actual drugs seized (Lynch
2016). In addition, **mandatory minimums also apply to drug trafficking conspiracy crimes in which the
total amount trafficked by the group in question can be applied to all members of the group** (Lynch
2016). The USSC Guidelines (2015b) specifically state, “Types and quantities of drugs not specified in
the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level. Where there is no drug
seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the
quantity of the controlled substance.”"

from cases below the threshold rather than above it. I also show that the bunching is more pronounced in
trial cases, **which suggests that drug amounts are being moved above the cutoff and not negotiated down
to it**. Second, I take advantage of the time variation in the crack-cocaine 10-year mandatory minimum
threshold to isolate bunching that is solely due to prosecutor choices. Finally, I examine data at multiple
stages in the criminal justice process and conduct several empirical tests that all suggest prosecutorial
discretion negatively affects minority defendants."

Then I like Andy Behrens and Scott Pianowski from Yahoo.  Brandon Funston's good too, but I think he's also with The Athletic.  And Rudy Gamble from Razzball.  I'm sure there are a bunch I'm forgetting.

If I had to only pick a couple, I'm a huge fan of Behrens and Sporer.  Piano too, and in fact, if you combine Piano's and Sporer's advice you kinda get a balanced strategy.  Sporer is more likely to take risks, but they're calculated risks. While Piano likes the sneaky value of quiet, boring productive players.  

Best thing I ever learned from Piano was what he calls ""Ibanez all-stars.""  Players, like Raul Ibanez, who steadily put together above average production and can be had for very cheap.  It's why I always end up with Shin Soo Choo types.

From Sporer, he's got something called ""The Glob"" when it comes to pitchers.  Instead of looking at pitchers as a set of ranks - after like the top 20 or 25 they can start being sorted into huge ""globs"" where they're all basically the same value, just depends on your personal preference.
