antiwork,fglv1xh,t1_fgls9xs,1580911620.0,"Reddit has contributed to my negative outlook on life. Facebook too. They're catalysts for the media, and the media only shares news that will get them views and make them money. Social media is also excellent at spreading misinformation and creating unrealistic, toxic attitudes toward well, really anything.

There's plenty of good happening that isn't shared often. I've read that in terms of wars, religion, etc, the world is actually more peaceful than it's ever been before. And even though the internet contributes to this spread of negativity, it also gives us the ability to have vast amounts of knowledge at our fingertips from nearly anywhere in the world.

I dread waking up early so I can help my CEO afford his Superbowl tickets and live in a multi-million dollar house, while I struggle to save for a half-decent house that *hopefully* won't have mold and foundation issues. I dread giving up 40+ hours of my life every week so I can afford food and a roof.

But then I remember some of the cool people I've met along the way. I remember that I don't worry where my next meal will come from. I remember that my dad once lived in a trailer. My aunt had zero furniture and struggled financially for a few years out of college despite being married to a lawyer. I'm far better off than they were at my age. My aunt, boss, etc might have big fancy houses and live large, but it's taken them decades to get to that point, and I'm just barely getting started. I can't wait to see how I turn out."

Lars, the 340-lb Russian lifeguard approached Mackenzeigh and told her to take a 5 minute break. Within just seconds of assuming his newly earned station in the life guard tower, Lars watched OP get hit in the head with a volleyball. Everything went black.

OP slowly sank. This moment was everything Lars had been training for. This would be his chance to be a hero. Gripping his floatation device with his yellow, cigarette-stained unkempt nails, Lars sprang from his chair and leapt into the salty pool water. His 340 pounds of body fat swayed to and fro as he swam toward OP. With a struggle, he dragged OP out of the water and onto the pool deck, battling his own overweight belly even moreso than the man he intended to save. A crowd gathered round as Lars did chest compressions, but to no avail. Without any other options, Lars mentally prepared himself to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. His crusty, pink lips pressed against OP's, and he gave rescue breaths with the force of a thousand suns.

OP came to, coughing up water all over Lars. A single tear rolling down Lars' cheek, he cracked a smile. As OP became aware of the events that had just unfolded, he became uneasy. How could this *beast* of a man be his rescuer? But then it donned on him - the stocky man had just saved his life! How could he ever repay him? He searched his mind for the right words, though truthfully, nothing does this act of service any real justice. It was with a raspy, still-recovering voice that he cracked the words -

I used to be grateful. It was difficult for me to become angry or resentful because I knew to appreciate what I had. I grew up this way and I think that resulted in me never learning how to deal with real stress. Now that one thing after another constantly tries to bring me down, I put a smile on my face and push through it. But that's worn me down very thin now, and I'm finding that since I never learned how to cope, I just get more and more stressed.

I became complacent. Being easily forgiving turned me into a pushover. Being eager to please others made me feel like an unappreciated servant. Being humble made me less proud of who I am.  All these ""positive"" traits have gotten me into this depressing rut and it's just getting so difficult. Don't worry, I'm not suicidal or anything - I know how depressed I sound. Regardless, I'm quickly learning how hard real life can hit you sometimes, and I just don't know how to move forward. But I do anyway, in the hopes that it will get better someday.
