CasualConversation,ffe2iqw,t3_esykyi,1579835009.0,Broke my right wrist once (and I’m right-handed). I remember how that went.  Hope you’re feeling better soon!

PublicFreakout,ffe0xav,t1_ffcsnv0,1579833844.0,"I know! It’s Miss Manners 101 - don’t eavesdrop on other people’s conversations, and it won’t matter what language they’re speaking."
childfree,ffe00r9,t1_ffcfk2l,1579833191.0,That happens in the US too.  It’s horrid.  Children deserve better.
AmItheAsshole,ffdzbf6,t1_ffdwiub,1579832678.0,"Maybe if enough people actively opt out like that, they’ll get the message and stop hounding everyone for cash."
AmItheAsshole,ffdykv5,t1_ffdi7ga,1579832147.0,"I agree 100%.  In many workplaces, it’s getting ridiculous - people are getting hit up for a few dollars here and there every week. 

Not to sound like a Scrooge, but as I mentioned in a previous comment, we’re there to earn a living.  And it adds up!"
AmItheAsshole,ffdy0f2,t3_et178c,1579831740.0,"NTA:  Your coworker had absolutely no business putting in money on your behalf and then demanding that you “pay him back.”  That’s pretty nervy of him.  Don’t let him coerce or try to “shame” you into giving him the money.  Tell him to drop it or he’ll have some explaining to do to your manager or HR.  

At the end of the day, we’re all at work to earn a living and afford to pay the bills we’re actually responsible for.  Although it’s nice when we are friendly with our coworkers and acknowledge major life events for them, it’s not mandatory and no-one should be making their coworkers feel like it is."
childfree,ffbf7xu,t3_esjl9w,1579762692.0,"Your mother should not be dictating your life to you like this.  She’s trying to make like the only option is for you to take one of the kids. 

 I can understand why cps doesn’t want an 8 year old girl sharing a room with her older brother, and they don’t accept for her to sleep on the couch, but why didn’t the mother consider giving the girl her room and sleeping on the couch herself?

Also, if the state is involved in placing these children with op’s mother, wouldn’t there be some kind of foster care funding from the state that might enable op’s mother to get a house or apartment with more bedrooms?  Because of how quickly the mother was able to get op to agree to do something she absolutely dreads doing, I feel bad for her. It seems like her mother is accustomed to guilt tripping her and getting her own way to the point where op has been trained to obey without question. It’s funny how her mom is more concerned with being a proper foster mother to her niece and nephews than being a good mother to her own child."
childfree,ff35lol,t3_er8e4w,1579534226.0,"I hate when people say this.  There are no guarantees.  I’ve seen the following happen to people I know: baby born with a condition that means child will need to be cared for permanently by the parents, and arrangements made for when the parents die; child born healthy but becomes ill later and needs constant care, child grows up to be a drug addict, and either has their own kids taken away and placed with the grandparents or grandparents end up with custody after adult child goes to prison for running a meth lab, etc.  With the opioid crisis here in the U.S., many grandparents are raising their orphaned grandchildren because both the parents od’d. Even if your child is normal, healthy, and transitions fairly smoothly into functioning  adulthood, it really does not end at 18."
AmItheAsshole,feywc8k,t1_fey2eka,1579451289.0,I wondered that too - was she going to have step father pay for it all and have bio dad walk her down the aisle?  That would be awful!
childfree,fewnlpl,t3_eqayu4,1579415903.0,"This reminds me of two of my favorite Loretta Lynn songs: “The Pill” and “One’s on the Way”.  Hard to picture a time when women had no choice, and hard to believe there are so many people who want that choice to be taken away from us."
AmItheAsshole,fewlxsq,t3_eqjdna,1579414087.0,"NTA: And your manager gave in three times to this miserable horrid woman and gave refunds!  Someone had to tell her off, good for you!  

And if the coffee is so horrible why keep buying it?  Someone obviously just wants free coffee.  After the third time, especially because she blocked the line and kept other paying customers from being waited on, the manager would have been right to ban her."
AmItheAsshole,fewk49o,t3_eqfixn,1579412350.0,"NTA:  I’m really tired of all the holier than thou assholes who seem to need to control everyone else.  Your body, your choice of what to put into it. Especially when you have health conditions affected by diet."
AmItheAsshole,fewjkcz,t3_eqf0v4,1579411926.0,"NTA:  Although I may be biased. 

 Still occasionally feel irritated at the time my mother in law went out of her way to include my brother in law (husband’s older brother) “flavor of the month” girlfriend while going out of her way to leave me out of, a family photo taken at a wedding.  When we’d been married over 5 years with a two year old child together!  And the girlfriend ended up getting caught red handed cheating on his brother in law. And framed photo came down never to be seen again.  So I feel your pain. Definitely NTA!"
AmItheAsshole,fewixzw,t3_eqhc3o,1579411481.0,"NTA.  Your wife keeps saying “my house, my rules”. We’ll, it’s your house too, and your daughter, so you get a say too.

  And she could have waited til the friends went home, and then discussed with your daughter. And laid out what the consequence would be if she did the same thing again in the future.  She cause a big miserable scene and humiliated your daughter.  When a child has an overbearing step parent it’s important for the bio parent to have the kid’s back.  You did great!"
AmItheAsshole,fewidhu,t3_eqnyem,1579411140.0,"NTA:  You paid for her college education and bought her a car.  Those are two huge expenses that can financially crush a young adult just starting out in life.  She should have gotten a job and saved up for her dream wedding.  Or here’s a thought or two:  her mother can pony up the dough, or bio dad can pay for her for once!  

Most college kids I know have student loans or have to work while carrying a full course load, and then have to pay student loans on top of buying their own car to get back and forth to work.  Instead of her and her mother appreciating everything you’ve done they’re both acting like spoiled brats, and they are both TA."
AmItheAsshole,fdkpf51,t3_eliwde,1578508401.0,"NTA:  Cannot believe they made the sexist assumption that you’re supposed to supply the office with homemade goodies,  and then had the nerve to complain about something YOU said in jest.

Quick suggestion for future office potlucks: and this is what I do, btw: go to Walmart and buy a few packages of those mini cupcakes from their bakery.  They are labelled peanut free.  Then you sweetly tell your coworkers you were worried someone might have a  deadly nut allergy, and you wanted to be on the safe side."
aww,fdcchak,t3_ekdxj7,1578271574.0,Can’t take the cuteness! Glad I discovered this sub.
aww,fdccebl,t3_ekkfe7,1578271522.0,You are an awesome parent for raising a kindhearted kid who loves animals!

childfree,fdc7tsi,t3_ebug3t,1578268794.0,"It’s so irresponsible for parents to do that!  My cousin had a roommate who was a single mom to a four year old.  She would take off while my cousin was in the shower and then not answer her phone.  The first few times she did that, my cousin was home with no specific plans anyway, so she didn’t really complain, but she drew the line when the roommate stayed out all night, then came back so late the next morning she made my cousin late for work.  

I always felt bad for the kid..little kids are frequently smarter than adults give them credit for, and every time this happened, my cousin said the kid looked sad, almost like they knew their mom didn’t really care about them."
childfree,fdbvc2r,t3_ekjhlp,1578262540.0,"Why do some people act as though the only legacy you can leave is if you have kids?  When you have a baby, their health is assessed shortly after birth and the doctor will record something called an Apgar score in their medical records.  This test was created by Dr Virginia Apgar - a woman who became a doctor in an era when most women just got married and had kids.  Ironically enough, iirc, she did not ever have any babies of her own.  Yet her legacy lives on in this newborn test and other contributions she made toward infant and child health through her work."
childfree,fdbtxv7,t1_fd2x3ck,1578262062.0,That takes some nerve.  It sounds like she wasn’t looking for a date so much as the opportunity to mooch a free meal for herself and her kids.  Bet she thought you’d be too embarrassed to just walk out.  Good for you not allowing yourself to be manipulated and used.
childfree,fd37goj,t3_ejxdca,1578155441.0,"Agree. I know a woman who prides herself on being super skinny, and was always on her daughter’s back for supposedly being chunky.  And she wasn’t fat, just didn’t have that skinny look her mother has.  I always felt bad for the girl..the one person who is supposed to love you unconditionally was the one making her feel bad."
childfree,fcph4t6,t3_ehtqfh,1577863806.0,"Yes, poor people throughout history have had kids..and those kids frequently suffered as a result of their poverty.  And throughout most of history, there wasn’t reliable birth control.  Listen to that song “One’s on the Way” by Loretta Lynn.  It’s best for children to be planned and born to parents who are financially stable - notice I did not say rich.   Parents should have their education completed and at least a couple of years established in a decent paying job with some money in savings before they have their first child."
AmItheAsshole,fcozth2,t3_ei8z50,1577846173.0,"NTA:  I used to have a job where I worked from home when my child was young enough to need daycare/after school care.  We were told that working from home was not to be used as a substitute for daycare.  If my power or internet went out, I was required to report to the office.  Your roommate is out of line, it is his responsibility to hire a babysitter or enroll his child in daycare.  And you definitely are NTA."
