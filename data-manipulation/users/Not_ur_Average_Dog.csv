dogs,ffeyfo6,t1_ffeyaq8,1579870367.0,"I get that you don't want your new puppy to get hurt, but how many times did all of us get hurt as a kid?!?! Riding a bike, falling out of a tree, throwing rocks??? I remember falling in my neighbors rose bush. Guess what, I learned to watch out for those things."
dogs,ffexz0p,t3_et8uk8,1579869914.0,The puppy doesnt understand social cues from other dogs yet. The puppy doesnt understand when the older dog communicates that it is done playing. When my first dog was an obnoxious puppy he did the same thing and after getting nipped at a few times at the dog park he started to understand when dogs dont want to play anymore. That's why socializing a new dog is so important.

dogs,ff05r67,t3_er09c4,1579465484.0,"On our most recent visit to the shelter to adopt a new dog, we had picked out online 4 dogs we wanted to meet with our dogs. When we arrived we would wait in the meeting area and the staff would bring in 1 dog at a time to meet our dogs. The staff brought only 1 of the right dogs. They brought the wrong ones 3 times. We just laugh about it now after picking an entirely different dog anyways. But at the end of the day, many of them are volunteers and new dogs are coming and going from that place every day. So I get how easy it is mix things up."

findapath,fcuf03f,t3_ef0oqy,1577979360.0,"I am currently working on my master's degree and receiving reimbursement from my company. While I do enjoy what i study, im not certain that it's what I want to do for a career anymore. At this point, I am almost finished, so I will just finish the degree out. The only issue is that I hate my current employer and I am trying to change jobs. So if I do that, I will be paying back all the tuition money. Then I will ultimately end up paying for the degree all myself. My advanced degree is still going to be beneficial down the road, so I dont regret it. However, i may have held off on my master's degree and gotten it in something a little different. 

IMO, you sound like you want to change companies, and I bet that it's a similar policy where you would have to pay back the money if you leave within a certain amount of time. So dont feel bad for not taking the opportunity right now."

IMO the most important thing for finding what you want to do is trying out different jobs! Every new job/internship that I worked taught me something that I did or didnt like about that job or company. It gives more insight for later. Also, having some different work experience, even if it seems insignificant may help down the road. Even if you just worked a retail job for a little while, later on it may help you get a job at some retail company's corporate location doing marketing or HR or something else."
