BlackPeopleTwitter,fdcixzf,t1_fdcfr5r,1578276049.0,"We do. He’s a source of pride for Mexicans. Mexicans actually see the appropriation of our culture as a positive, it means people love it or like it enough to try it and we aren’t greedy so we enjoy people trying it out. There’s enough beans for everyone."
aww,fcbx7c1,t1_fcbvdb7,1577591971.0,"The fact that they are eaten is besides the point. They are housed and maintained by people. In terrible conditions, they suffer everyday. But you would rather take qualm with the people have have unconventional pets but take very good care of them. I find it more weird that people aren’t outraged at how those animals are treated and others are even ok with it, but again keeping and caring for animals that make you scared or uncomfortable and giving them comfortable lives is the weird thing?"
aww,fcbt90d,t1_fcbrb8h,1577590715.0,"I mean not really, because what we are discussing is subjective. I’m asking why people think it’s weird because it isn’t to me. So rather than sound off by trying to belittle my passion explain to me why you think this is weird. Like I said, how is this weirder than the people who own the tens of millions of animals that are slaughtered each year in deplorable conditions. I guarantee each one of my animals is better cared for than most people’s pet dogs and cats."
aww,fcbd8il,t1_fcbbglw,1577585440.0,"LOL, to each their own has always been my way of living. I love these animals just like you may love whatever it is you love. As long as people practice what they love without causing harm to another living being I am completely fine with whatever it might be."
aww,fcb8iwu,t1_fcb7tlr,1577583753.0,"They don’t smell, and yes they’re in one special room. And they all have their own tanks/enclosures to fit their needs. I have guests over and there is no complaints, most want to see them and handle the ones that can be handled. Don’t worry like I said I’m not offended and I’m not judging you for not being into the same things I am into. If anything I just want to see if I can help dispel any false assumptions people may have to help them better understand this lifestyle. I guarantee there is absolutely no smell. Seriously."
aww,fcb5ns9,t1_fcb51v8,1577582679.0,"But do you think the people that own the millions of chickens that we eat are weird? Or cows, or any other animal? At the very least I know mine are very well taken care of, I think what makes it weird is the stigma surrounding reptiles and how most people are afraid of them."

aww,fcay0ol,t1_fcawxu3,1577578852.0,"I’m not even close to having as many as some of my other friends in the reptile community. What people dont understand is that the dog/cat comparison isn’t a viable one. Most reptiles eat 2-3 times a week and are more “look don’t touch”, snakes eat once a week for the most part. I make sure they are all cared for. The homes I put most of them in is what we call bioactive which means there are microbes and fauna in the soil or substrate which clean up after the animal itself. I really only have to interact with them for enrichment and feeding."
aww,fcaxjxe,t1_fcax4v1,1577578592.0,"You’re completely right. They don’t, or most don’t. Many would argue tegus and some monitors are capable. But to me it’s more about being able to love them, help them thrive and admire them."
aww,fcasvn6,t1_fcaeenw,1577575949.0,"Let me ask you a question, as a reptile owner. What makes you think we are weird? Serious question, not judging or anything. I own two reticulated pythons, 3 triceros hoehnelli chameleons, a bearded dragon, two blue tongue skinks, one panther chameleon, two leopard geckos, one created gecko, a Savannah monitor, two pac man frogs, one madagascar giant day gecko, and one Sonoran gopher snake. I might be forgetting some. But I love them all."
AskReddit,fc43irc,t3_efqzp6,1577405682.0,"Got fired Christmas Eve because I made mistakes because my abusive girlfriend kept me up til 4 am arguing and beating me on the head with her phone on on the 22nd then I went to work with a bloody eyebrow. Then spent Christmas wallowing about my situation and taking care of my dad who is sad because my sister is getting married next week in Mexico and moving away, my girlfriend isn’t allowing me to go to the wedding. And my older brother who just got out of prison for the domestic abuse he put us through our entire life threatened to kill my dad with the many guns he already has in the house. Christmas is always a bad time for me."
