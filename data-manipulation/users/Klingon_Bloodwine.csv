- Long career as a starting QB
- Insane Iron Man streak(consecutive starts)
- 4x Pro Bowl
- 2x SB Champ and 2x MVP, one of which beating one of the best teams the NFL has ever seen in a single season.

He has Mediocre stats, but not awful. He played in a tough market. It's not one thing that puts him in, but a collection of achievements over a 14 year career as the starting QB for the New York Giants. So many franchises out there would kill for a QB to have a career like he did, a Superbowl Caliber QB that's gonna give you 16+ games a year for 14 years. I've seen him take some savage hits too, he's like Favre and just kept going. Absolute fucking workhorse!"

Something to the affect of ""How come nobody is playing this? I'm not making excuses to come in and play this on the weekends, and neither are you."". That's definitely something a lot of team members might not want to bring up on their own, but it's incredibly important for the director to acknowledge and openly bring up."

politics,fdonfat,t1_fdo61ue,1578608713.0,"I was gonna say, this shit isn't new. It was the same during Bush's tenure. It's real simple, if there is a war and the President is Republican, core Republican voters will consider it near treason to criticize the President. If the President is a Democrat, then it's an American duty to criticize the President, even if a Republican President began the war.

There is no room for logic in tribal politics. Many of the same assholes spewing this shit are the same ones who were claiming Obama was a foreign born Muslim terrorist trying to destroy America from the inside."

Both sides do this invisible psychic dance and when they swing their lightsaber, it's just them acting on all the calculations they did with the force beforehand.

Mechwarrior5,fc3jlyk,t3_efzv9i,1577391240.0,"I did this. The good is you can grind at fairly low levels, max out your rep for someone, then max out your salvage for easy missions to get new mechs and sell them for decent cash. Having a good stockpile of cash, mechs, and gear really helps when moving on to harder areas.

The bad is that there really isn't much variety in gameplay. You're still playing the same kind of missions, just with different mechs and a higher difficulty level. If you spend too long at those lower levels and get bored of the missions, you might find yourself bored later on even though you're piloting different mechs."
