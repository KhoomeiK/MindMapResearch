Wrangler,ffbxzxn,t3_esscva,1579786372.0,Good thinking with the pontoons on the roof - hopefully you don’t roll and never need them.
UpliftingNews,ffb003p,t3_esle0m,1579748441.0,By ‘re-educating’ the populace? Take them camping maybe?  Special camping in special camps...?

mountainbikes,ff4yqtn,t1_ff4xj1v,1579575679.0,"The Trek has less suspension travel, and likely a steeper head angle than the Trance. It’s made for efficient riding at speed and is lean and stiff, but is probably less comfortable on long rides.  

The Trek will climb better than the Trance, but the Trance won’t be bad, and will outgun the Trek on the downhills. It will arguably feel more fun too with it’s smaller and more nimble wheels. 29ers from 8-10 years back were kinda ponderous, though I have no experience of this particular Trek 29er.

Either way, welcome back and happy trails."
mountainbikes,ff4wglp,t3_ernzbg,1579574094.0,"The Trance is the better all rounder, and probably the one you’ll appreciate most.  

The Trek is a cross country race machine and will be less comfortable and less forgiving on challenging terrain."

todayilearned,feopmhx,t3_eq4xlf,1579303597.0,I’ll be a little disappointed if they didn’t call themselves “The Bomb Squad”.
