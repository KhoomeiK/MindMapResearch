Why can't you make the argument that the tenant caused the value of the property to decrease and thus you are owed money?  If you are also arguing that the tenant helped increase the value through maintenance of the property, negligence would cut the other way. 

Sure property owners can lower the value of their house, If I smash through a window and leave a burned out car on the driveway, that lowers it, all easily fixable but still lowers it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff9o73b,t1_ff9hw95,1579717108.0,"Your middle ground doesn't make any sense?

What if the property depreciates in value, does the tenant owe the landlord more money when their stay is over?  If they've got a claim on the increased value then they've got an obligation to the debt accrued if the value sinks.

How is the tenant paid out when their time is up, do I take out another loan on the building to pay the tenant off?  Or am I forced to sell to the tenant for the remaining equity?  Maybe it only paid when I sell the property, but what if I never sell?

Would that apply to hotels, if I rent a room for a week, do I get a tiny percentage ownership of the hotel?

If we are being clever about this, the person that owns the house is incentivized under your system to keep the house price exactly where it was on the day you started renting and then to lower it so you get nothing from your rent payments.  Or even to overvalue it at the time of rent to avoid any of this nonsense, if you don't think that will happen I've got a bridge to sell you.

What you are proposing is a mortgage with minimal or no down payment, and we already have those just with a larger stake required to initiate the process."

But in order for that to happen the traincar needs to be modified to accommodate.  This is somethings that cant be done at the station, so the train needs to go somewhere and wait for modifications. This is going to cause it to miss a scheduled journey (commuter train) moving the cars to and from servicing area.  Train might be broken down and sent on it's way with 2 cars but will cause a delay. So add 3 x 66 x $16 ($3168) for 1 full missed journey.
Then add it again because this process needs to be reversed later.  
If it's a busy line they might not be able to put the seat back till later in the day so they might be adding $1056 for every journey to and fro.  
  
Not quite sure how they got as high as $25000  unless they just decided to charge for all seats in one car for every journey that day.  Or maybe 25k is their private traincar hire fee, I tried to look that up but needed to phone their offices."

Why can't you make the argument that the tenant caused the value of the property to decrease and thus you are owed money?  If you are also arguing that the tenant helped increase the value through maintenance of the property, negligence would cut the other way. 

Sure property owners can lower the value of their house, If I smash through a window and leave a burned out car on the driveway, that lowers it, all easily fixable but still lowers it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff9o73b,t1_ff9hw95,1579717108.0,"Your middle ground doesn't make any sense?

What if the property depreciates in value, does the tenant owe the landlord more money when their stay is over?  If they've got a claim on the increased value then they've got an obligation to the debt accrued if the value sinks.

How is the tenant paid out when their time is up, do I take out another loan on the building to pay the tenant off?  Or am I forced to sell to the tenant for the remaining equity?  Maybe it only paid when I sell the property, but what if I never sell?

Would that apply to hotels, if I rent a room for a week, do I get a tiny percentage ownership of the hotel?

If we are being clever about this, the person that owns the house is incentivized under your system to keep the house price exactly where it was on the day you started renting and then to lower it so you get nothing from your rent payments.  Or even to overvalue it at the time of rent to avoid any of this nonsense, if you don't think that will happen I've got a bridge to sell you.

But in order for that to happen the traincar needs to be modified to accommodate.  This is somethings that cant be done at the station, so the train needs to go somewhere and wait for modifications. This is going to cause it to miss a scheduled journey (commuter train) moving the cars to and from servicing area.  Train might be broken down and sent on it's way with 2 cars but will cause a delay. So add 3 x 66 x $16 ($3168) for 1 full missed journey.
Then add it again because this process needs to be reversed later.  
If it's a busy line they might not be able to put the seat back till later in the day so they might be adding $1056 for every journey to and fro.

Maybe if you just opted into having edgy content in your recommended.  Like the ""mature"" filter on google search.  They can still advertise but it's mostly 888 casino and other betting things, or loans and banking apps."
worldnews,fewmvgo,t1_fewm1ht,1579415097.0,"I know that's not how it should work but it's how it does work and has done for years.  
  
Why do you think youtube has certain rules about what content cant be uploaded.  It's because the things on the prohibited list would be bad PR and that would cost them money. If it was more profitable and PR friendly youtube would be the worlds largest amature porn site in a heartbeat.  
  
As it turns out those rules are guided by public perception and advertisers.  If you create a large enough panic and outrage over a topic youtube will pivot to ban that content.  (Sorry, derank, limit reach demonitize and occasionally ban offending channels without reason or recourse).

worldnews,fewma2b,t1_fewlt1k,1579414450.0,"I like the idea proposed by twitter.  You have a gated area for family friendly ad friendly stuff.  And then you have an opt in area where all bets are of where youd find the more edgy content. So youtube could put their hands up every time and say, ""well its gated away in the no holds barred section"" and they wouldn't have to constantly be tweaking what we saw based on news outrage.  
  
No one has an issue with climate denial forums, but somehow are freaking out over the same shit on youtube."

YouTube does not give 2 fucks about climate change denial, but they sure as hell care about being portrayed badly in the media for having that content.  
  
Same for any political ""issue"" they dont promote LGBT rights because they care or want to further the cause, they do it because they think they'll lose money if they dont."

A video of a dude in  a lab coat telling lies and another video telling the truth is hard for an algorithm to differentiate.  
  
Not to mention those might be the videos I want to watch, I enjoy a good laugh at conspiracy stuff.  In which case the algorithm is working perfectly while also pushing dangerous misinformation. ( You watch 1 joe rogan and suddenly the interdimentional clockwork elves are chem-trailing dmt)"

Try and sell anything with a likeness to Mickey Mouse.  
  
You might have a cool idea for a videogame with Space Marines in it but without a license to that IP GamesWorkshop can and will sue or force a change.  
  
Try and transfer ownership of a digital purchase or resell it to a friend, iTunes etc.  Or play your new DVD of oceans 11 to a room full of people.  Or paint nyancat on your Ferrari. 
  
A lot of the time it's just letters on a page of legal gibberish, not some company goons coming round your house, but they can if they felt like it.  
  
In this case one guy has the legal right to go after any ""art"" containing vantablack. You can own as much of it as you want, but if you turn it into ""art"" this guys gonna be there with the lawyers.  Now what the lawyers can do is a different matter, maybe they can have your art destroyed or maybe just prevent sale I dont know."

You can change religions on your deathbed and re-write wills, marry and divorce, but what about the organs?
