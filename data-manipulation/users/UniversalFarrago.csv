When I was a kid, I had severe separation anxiety. I chalk it up to a traumatic birth (I damn near died).

So when she would drop be off at the nursery before heading to work, she'd often stay out of my sight for about 10-15 minutes, making sure I was fully okay (I'd have silent meltdowns, I wasn't a tantrum kid, more of a ""sit in my corner and cry for 6 hours"" kid), before heading off. I never knew any of this.

One time (I must've been around 3), she had to leave because she was so amused by something I did.

Apparently, I was sitting on this circular rug in the middle of the room, looking at a particularly engrossing picture book, when suddenly a bunch of kids sat down right by me, and were playing loudly/fighting over some new toy truck or something. Apparently I immediately made this annoyed/dismayed/scrunchy face, got up, dragged my book with me, and got as far as physically possible from this group of children, back facing them, and resumed reading my book. Anytime they got too rowdy, I'd glare back at them, then scoot my diapered ass a little bit further until I literally had my forehead propped against the wall, the book on my lap, and my ears covered with my little pudgy hands.

Asking her to grab it from the trash is first of all, kind of shitty and demeaning, and second of all, pretty much saying ""Turn around and look away for a while"". It's not what you intended, but if you think about it, it's not unreasonable to reach that conclusion, since the trash would be some distance away.

Thetruthishere,fdhkrak,t1_fdha1ek,1578424730.0,"Not OP, but hear me out. This is gonna seem like a super stretch, but bear with me.

My main interest is ETs/UFOs. Though calling them ETs may be an oversimplification; it seems they're more interdimensional than space aliens. But anyway, I digress.

A lot of people, throughout history, report seeing ""aliens"" in human disguise. If you read religious and folkloric texts, you hear weirdly similar stories, all over the world, all throughout history.

Interestingly, when you start to really dig into the Bigfoot phenomenon, you start to see similarities in fae folklore; Bigfoot up and vanishing without a trace out in the open, for instance. Hunters and other witnesses frequently report, say, seeing a tree, but it's out of place. The tree wasn't there before. Something's off about it. It looks like a tree, but...they just _know_ it isn't. Then, sometimes, some witnesses will say the illusion slips for a second, and it's a fucking Bigfoot just standing there, and then bam, he's gone. Just blink, poof, vanished.

So as you start to notice these patterns time and time again, you start to dig. And if you're able to suspend your bias, disbelief, and programming and just remain objective to the data you're going through, it seems that this kind of disguising is a common, recurring theme for all nonhuman higher intelligences.

My theory is that it's all psychic. I'll explain what I mean by that.

All that reality is, as we understand and perceive and experience it with the 5 senses, is information/stimuli being filtered through the biological machine that is the human brain. This is a scientific fact that's recognized globally.

What is still not understood is what pilots the brain, what triggers the electric synapses of our neurological pathways, what generates thought, ie the mind, ie consciousness.

If you start to really look at it, really think about, truly analyze ESP and the ""soul"" and consciousness itself, it becomes apparent that consciousness/our minds operate outside the brain; the brain is just a translator/controller for our bodies.

If you accept this, then psychic phenomena starts to make a lot more sense; if consciousness exists outside the physical body, then that means that there's an entirely new layer to the universe/reality itself, one that exists both as a part of yet independent to our physical, 3D universe. Which means, in theory, that this can somehow be manipulated.

The best sort of parallel I can give you would be radio waves; the energetic wave/radiation that is radio always existed, long before we noticed it, understood it, and were able to manipulate it. 500 years ago, the idea of dialing into a radio station and transmitting/playing literally anything you want was like magic. Now, it's a mundane, scientific thing we take for granted every day. 

ESP is exactly like that, except in our case, it's like manipulating the universe itself, because you're tapping into the consciousness/reality matrix that is matter. I hope that makes sense.

So if someone is somehow able to control this, they are able to control what it is you perceive, which, for all intents and purposes, is controlling reality itself as the mainstream paradigm understands it.

So what I have a feeling is going on isn't so much that the demon/whatever is actually physically embodying a human body (unless it's a posession case), but rather, is psychically messing with your ""radio"" signal, so that you see a human image instead of a nonhuman one. Think of it as cloaking.

That's my first theory.

My second theory is that physical, 3-dimensional reality is all illusory (there's quite a bit of mathematical evidence that shows that the known universe is a simulation). If this is true, and like the nursery rhyme, it's all a ""dream"", then someone outside of it who knows it's all smoke and mirrors could make and/or be whatever the he they want, like a modder using the asset editor in a videogame to make a custom model. The NPCs in the game, if they had a mind, would have no understanding of how your khajit suddenly has giant anime tits, but there they are. Really, all you did was very simple; you messed with the game a little bit.
