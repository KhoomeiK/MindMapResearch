To OP. I’m so sorry you’re going through this before the birth of your child. I can’t wait until you and baby are healthy and you can look him in his face and show him how silly he was to be putting all this stress on you during this special and quite frankly, already stressful enough, time in your life."
Soulnexus,ffibduc,t3_etodn5,1579969837.0,"We have a tree in front of my house that I grew up in. It grows berries that I don’t believe are edible for humans but they are for birds. I don’t know the kind of tree, but it’s relatively short and it has pretty flowers in the spring.

Anyway. I used to hangout under this tree, climb it, I found toads in it. Watched birds have babies in the birdhouse my dad built.

But, one day, as an adult. I was thinking about how this tree might think of me. Idk why the thought occurred to me. But I do believe trees are sentient. I literally thought how this tree watched me grow up, and how every single day I walk past it when I go inside my house. It actually makes me sad to write all this out, knowing I have barely acknowledge the tree in all these years. But the tree sat in the same spot while every day of every year I would encounter the tree in some way. And we used to have quite a few trees on my property and not as many anymore. This is one of the 3 original of my property. (A tree fell down on my house about 20 years ago so my dad had most of them removed) 

I feel like my story is not really related but I was reminded of my thoughts upon reading this post. However, when I die, my dying wish is to honestly have my corpse put in a burlap sack with a tree so that my remains can be used as fertilizer for a tree. I’d literally rather have a tree than a tombstone. I hope someone can fulfill that for me"

The pet industry is horrible.

That being said, my advice, even though I wasn’t a huge fan of the vet prior to getting my ferrets. I’ve since found a really nice vet who specializes in exotics. I would find a vet who specializes in bearded dragons and just take her in for a once over and a wellness. It might be expensive and seem unnecessary but it is better to have professional guidance then second guessing every little thing. And then you have somewhere to go In case you’re gut tells you something is really wrong. It sucks, it’s a money pit, but the reward is healthy and happy babies. You will no longer have to stress needlessly about your pets wellness."

It’s been almost 7 months with my ferrets and I feel like I know everything there is to know about them. I did nonstop research after I got them and I read all the books at the library about them (I work at one, there isn’t much literature available anyway) and I even ended up receiving a book about exotic vet care so I even know the specifics of how they are bred and the diseases they get. So yeah, I would say I had 0 interest in the species and now I am more than mildly obsessed. I even have a cat, who I do adore, but man there is really nothing that compares to ferrets in their capacity to love, their awareness, their trainability, their personalities.

ferrets,febo7n4,t3_eobqu2,1578960974.0,"You do have to be diligent with it and patient. Instinctually they should take to it easily but there’s a few things to really get it down.  

First, if they start off using it good, hold your breath. You might come home to poop and pee in every corner of the cage. Don’t yell at them, don’t scold, honestly, it probably happened hours ago and they don’t even remember it. Just clean it up as complete as possible and start potty bootcamp. Which is essentially removing extra shelves/locking off part of the cage and leaving them with food water and litter box and a soft corner with blankets. This will teach them that every corner has a purpose. One is for potty, one is for eating, and one is for sleeping. After a little bit they’ll get it and you can start adding privileges, extra shelves or opening up parts of the cage. If they start having accidents, repeat until they stop having them, or they stop having as many. Mine are really really good and I did this. They have like a 99% hit rate but I’ve still had accidents, twice to be exact but you get the idea. I go in the bathroom with mine for playtime and they also go exclusively in one spot. It really makes cleaning super easy and it’s worth it. But it wasn’t always, and it took some time. You will get to know your ferrets. Like mine will start acting a certain way if they have to go. And sometimes we let them out of the cage and let them back in real quick and they go. They really are so smart and very capable animals. But you have to also work with them."

Even if she doesnt respond to the meds I think draining is also a possibility if you’re comfortable. I’ve debated it had mine not responded. I figure that soft wysong food would do the trick while healing so that might also be an option for the future.

I have a female ferret who a little over 8 months old. She was 1.9 pounds when I took her to the vet for this issue, I think she lost weight since I changed her food though. But they prescribed 2.5 ml of liquid clavamox and the bottle lasted exactly 3 weeks from the day I started. So now we are just doing the same thing again. I’m a week 5 right now of treatment.

Risk factors I’ve googled that my vet didn’t mention. The clavamox may cause diarrhea and dehydration.so luckily bc I went before thanksgiving I had a full 48 hours to monitor her. She never once had diarrhea or anything weird. I would check out for that if you’re giving it to yours too"

ferrets,fclx9cp,t1_fclptym,1577758705.0,"So I originally went to the vet the day before thanksgiving, so 11/27. I was advised to give her the antibiotic until the entire dose/bottle was finished. It took until about 12/18 for me to finish it. Coincidentally I had an appointment for my cat at the vet that same day. So when I went I showed him what her throat looked like as of that morning, and he gave me another bottle. Over the course of the first round one side was almost completely gone and one side looked visibly smaller but was still there. At this point the one side is completely gone but the other side still has one but it’s very very small. We still have half the dose left so I’m anticipating it should be gone by the time the bottle is done. We were given clavamox for cat/dog abscesses. So I think the reason that we have seen results is because we have been treating it for SO long at this point. But it paid off because one completely went away and the other is barely there now! So if you can get clavamox and treat it over a couple weeks hopefully you see results as well!"
