Music,ffbwmc9,t3_eshpmo,1579785180.0,"Why the fuck is no one freaking out about how cedric from mars volta and hyde from 70’s show are in any story together let alone this clusterfuck? I can’t believe what i’m reading. What’s next, jerry seinfeld and kim kardashian cure cancer together and then battle the mafia for the patents?"

AskReddit,ff3wgmu,t1_ff2ukg4,1579550350.0,"Yeah, lucky. When 99% of anyone else in the world talks about them almost committing suicide, all friends and family vanish."
AskReddit,ff3vtz9,t1_ff2y01l,1579549960.0,"Why is not letting your husband decompress after work something you had to ‘figure out’ through discussions. Seems like everyone in the world, including you, would prefer to decompress after work. But this guy needs a serious conversation to get what we all should get.
This conversation should really be about how marriage is a bad idea."
AskReddit,ff336b3,t1_fezvgs0,1579532485.0,"Guys really need to read this comment and delete their dating apps. This girl sounds like a very good quality person who means super well, but the app itself makes is almost impossible. So it truly is nothing personal when things fizzle out online, because it’s not like meeting someone out in the world the old fashioned way."
AskReddit,ff32cw9,t1_ff1ukg6,1579531859.0,The guys you’re friends with had the exact same dirty thought and just know not to share them.

todayilearned,fehnm0b,t1_fehmibk,1579120188.0,Clearly. Seems like you’re just excited to tell someone (anyone) off.

todayilearned,fehlt46,t1_fehl89g,1579119150.0,Yeah that’s that title of the post. Now did you read the comment I’m responding to? The one mentioning tech investments?

AskReddit,fdk9be8,t1_fdhnmj2,1578499001.0,I like to post exact comments ive made on a subject again and again on newer versions of the conversation just to see how wildly different the up/down votes are and the insane responses depending on who was there that day.
AskReddit,fdk90vn,t1_fdhjcnm,1578498818.0,"And when you tell them everything they said has been overly common, they respond aggressively with another thing that is said constantly about how they don’t do that at all. The irony deepens"

technology,fd96ech,t3_ejz93k,1578229146.0,"For decades anyone who has said this is happening is given the flippant tin foil hat judgement by everyone. But now that it’s being proven it’s not like we support the people who knew a long time ago, we still treat them like conspiracy idiots even though we really are the idiots. But there’s more of us so we’re right and they’re wrong."
AdviceAnimals,fd8yzhg,t1_fd6cyrg,1578225620.0,I never understood this advice. What boss’s can/cant do doesn’t mean shit. If they don’t like you they can get away with so much stuff legal or not and most employees couldn’t stop it if they tried. The only option is find a new job. Telling any boss to fuck off will likely ruin your job situation.

atheism,fcx2nxj,t3_ej1wif,1578048541.0,I’m surprised he didn’t double down because he’s ashamed that he’s stupid so i would expect him to attack your character in some wild way for disrespecting him.

AskReddit,fcu83ti,t1_fctfl6p,1577974803.0,"Something about ‘before discovering alcohol or weed’ is weird. If that happened on either it would be equally strange, since that shit doesn’t happen on booze and weed."

science,fcqphyh,t1_fcp2meg,1577890067.0,I feel like those extremes of sports where you’re going hard for extended periods of time all have detrimental aspects. People who do crazy long distance or hot yoga only all seem to have a sort of flatness that only seems to hurt them in the long run

To think that there would ever be support for people like me makes me suspicious, and will not exist when I go back on the road. Fun article though."
AdviceAnimals,fcjw6w6,t1_fcjpwm3,1577707696.0,This why i make the exact same comments on certain conversations to see how wildly different the responses are. Same exact words with no changes get’s every response you could imagine depending on the flow and who appears to have attention first.
