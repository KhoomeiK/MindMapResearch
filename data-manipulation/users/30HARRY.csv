How would everyone feel if companies started under-compensating people who drink alcohol, people who eat fast food, people who watch TV? Who decides what individual habits are healthy, and which aren't, and at what point do you draw that line?

If it's about abusing break policies, that's on management to either enforce the existing policy, or create one.

How do they determine who smokes? A nicotine test? Or just those who smoke at work? What if you smoke on the weekends? What if you smoke two cigarettes a day?

Giving a compensation incentive for forgoing a legal behavior is the same as paying people less who do X. Apply that policy to any protected class (""we'll pay employees more to forego homosexual relations"") and it would be the legal definition of discrimination.

Everyone has a vice. I don't understand how people are okay with employers discriminating against people with bad habits just because they're not *their* bad habits.

According to the [WHO](http://www.dwi.gov.uk/stakeholders/guidance-and-codes-of-practice/Boiling-water01-15.pdf) a water temperature of 158 F will kill everything in about a minute. Even on Everest, this is the temperature at which water boils. Meaning, if you run a rolling boil for one minute, no matter where you are on Earth, you have killed 99.999999% of harmful bacteria, protozoa, etc.

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/pdf/drinking/Backcountry_Water_Treatment.pdf) recommends three minutes, as a precaution.

It sounds to me, though, that your real motivation for advocating a new industry pay structure isn't about a fair wage, it's the second reason you stated: that you don't like figuring out how to tip.

Encantar is similar to gustar, and is mostly used as a backward verb, where the subject in English becomes the object in Spanish. Me encanta comer (object + verb + subject). Because of this, the conjugation for encantar must be in the third person, adhering to the subject (not you, you are the object). In the example in the post above, it becomes encantan (third person plural) because the subject is plural (los fideos).
