IndustrialDesign,feglb7x,t3_ep1jwa,1579096300.0,"Hmm I typed quite a bit but I think the form spazzed out on mobile. Anyway the few things I observed: you talk a lot about the limits, but ultimately most people going into instruments don't want to see the limits, they want to imagine becoming good with it. People are bad at recognising their limitations in the beginning most of the time. Also the simplified aspect of it raises a lot of what ifs, like what if I get good, now I'm stuck with something that can't play flats or sharps? If you plan to learn an instrument, you probably have the money for it in mind I would imagine. Especially for something like a sax, whose fans of that sort of music TENDS (not all, just most) to be of a higher social class and refined taste. I can understand this for a guitar though, as that is more widely received and accessible in some sense. Okay I might be rambling a little on this train of thought based on what I'm trying to remember from the link so I'll stop here."

singapore,fdp404i,t1_fdp23my,1578619467.0,"The reason why I say it's an image problem is because of the first off impression of the whole system before you even enter NS, just from BMT alone. Start of with the wrong footing of your initial impression and concept of NS and the problems which you mention above start to crop up because you will start looking at the problems.

Leadership isn't strictly related to success. And sometimes a good leader is much more effective than a smart problem solver. It's more an emotion thing than anything else, just like how Trump ended up in charge, how protests run, how people rally behind football clubs. Once you lose that emotion, you start thinking of the logic and problems. So then, how do you bring out patriotism as your core purpose there in NS despite the time sink? I personally see it as a branding and advertising issue actually."
