confessions,fe8vy60,t3_eo43m0,1578931584.0,"Thank you.

I’ve talked to so many hotlines. Some people helped, some didn’t. But I vividly remember the ones that did. The ones that validated my feelings, empathized with the immense amount of pain I was going through. 

When you’re in that place, it’s a disease. It consumes your thoughts, your life, your energy. You think irrationally. And as a last ditch effort you reach out. Hoping someone can take the pain away. But that’s not the importance of hotlines. Of course one person can’t take the pain away. They can, however, convince you today isn’t the day to die. And sometimes that’s enough.

You did a great service to people that were in so much pain. The fact that people called and talked to you meant that they wanted someone to be there with them, whether it was to convince them not to die, or whether they didn’t want to die alone. I’m so sorry you had to be there with so many people that had made up there mind, but just know that they wanted someone to see their pain and trusted you. 

You are a good person."
sad,fe332yk,t3_enidkr,1578845455.0,"I’m sorry you all have experienced this. You deserved to have been loved.

If you are experiencing significant distress, please see a therapist so that they can help you heal that inner child. There is help.

I send you all the love you never experienced and wish I could hold each one of you to let you know that you are loved just the way you are/were."
medical,fe0hzva,t3_enhba2,1578813735.0,"NAD but the childhood and high school memory loss symptom is something I get with my Dissociative Identity Disorder. Another one is misremembering, having bad long term memory, feeling fuzzy and like things are sometimes not real/not me. 

I was convinced that my parents never bought a new car and still had the one they were driving before I left the house. Would have sworn a million things on it. Turns out they had bought a new car months before I left the house and I was driven down to college in said car.

I’d echo other comments thinking it may be a psych/dissociative issue (especially if you have experienced traumatic events), and if not something neuro. But again NAD."
AmItheAsshole,fdmn1kg,t3_elwqyq,1578556260.0,"NTA. 

Sounds like he’s gaslighting you. You said you expressed your frustrations and reasons his actions upset you and he’s reframing your feelings in a way to minimize them."

CPTSD,fco08oa,t1_fcn30fw,1577821745.0,"I’m trans as well, and the liberation of changing my name not only to align with my identity but to escape the abusive past was incredible. 

Your name is lovely. :)"
rape,fcgjcmg,t3_eh5rlh,1577640760.0,"The second time I had already known what I could do to make myself feel better, so I got a sprite, checked out my favorite book, went to therapy, did drugs, and slept."
morbidquestions,fc9u7p7,t1_fc8odc8,1577558287.0,So... can it be used as an egg substitute while cooking?
raisedbynarcissists,fc0h7kt,t1_fc0h3nw,1577290773.0,That’s pretty much the only conclusion. No one from my host family accepted a gift from her.
