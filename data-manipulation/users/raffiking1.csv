asked by a man with autism."
CasualConversation,ffp49a9,t3_eufnh5,1580085856.0,"It's something really small:

I recently found out that the bus line that serves the bus stop closest to where I work gets a bus every 15 minutes during rush hour since summer 2019. However these additional buses don't seem to get used much, so I got a completely empty bus. On the route there is one point where the road is too narrow for buses to pass each other. Because no one wanted to get on or off at any stop we ended up being there a bit ahead of schedule, so we had to wait for the bus in the other direction. The bus driver actually made an announcement about why we had to wait and I was 99% sure that he/she knew, that I was his/her only passenger."

I don't think this will get us anywhere. I'm sorry for wasting your time."

TrueOffMyChest,ffox4b1,t3_euf7js,1580082864.0,I am in a very similar position right now. I was supposed to start applying for a new job more than 4 months ago now. But I didn't. Because I don't know what job I want to apply for. Every single one seems to be one that I wouldn't enjoy.
CasualConversation,ffouol4,t3_euf2yh,1580082002.0,"This is the ""what"", now I just need the ""how"".

Edit: you probably won't be able to give me the ""how"", because the ""what"" only becomes the ""how"" when it is extremely specific."
NoStupidQuestions,ffogzb1,t3_eudvrg,1580077544.0,"It depends a bit on which product we are talking about, but some reasons can be:

1. The company doesn't want you to be able to replace stuff
2. There are more space efficient options
3. There are more stable options
4. There are easier options."

I wanted to use linux to seperate my gaming stuff from my productive stuff (programming, writing documents, etc.). My problem is: I keep breaking stuff and I'm too bad at googling to find an answer."
NoStupidQuestions,fdc1yn6,t3_ekkfdr,1578265508.0,">how tf are the majority of voters voting for shit that inevitably fucks them over and the next generations?

Does it fuck over the majority of people or just a lot of people? It's likely that it is the second option."
CasualConversation,fd1nr2o,t3_ejtsav,1578133943.0,">Keep a gratitude journal (it can even be a sticky note with a couple things to start)

I tried doing that for 5 days. On day 4 I copied day 1 because I didn't have anything new to write down anymore. On day 5 I copied day 2. On day 6 I decided to stop because I felt terrible for not knowing anything to be grateful about anymore."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcx2k5w,t3_eiy54y,1578048405.0,"I am against the death penalty because I think it would be an incentive for some people to commit a death penalty worthy crime.

I could imagine there are some people who prefer to do something and then die over doing something and staying alive in prison or not doing that thing. To kinda prove my point, I would point at the number of people who make themselves the final kill of their killing spree."
NoStupidQuestions,fcx0i23,t1_fcugu67,1578045728.0,"What exactly do you mean with that?

TooAfraidToAsk,fcv83be,t3_ej0e30,1577996603.0,"I sometimes don't vote because I don't know who to vote for. In these cases, if I was forced to vote, my vote would be completely random.

The last time we had an election on the municipal level I didn't vote, but if I had to, I would have assigned each candidate a number and let random.org decide which one it would be. I don't consider such a vote to be of any help for anyone, so I just don't vote at all in these cases."

offmychest,fcndn8q,t1_fcnbycm,1577809499.0,">Screw your coworkers. And maybe go eat at a park or some where relaxing near by?

But then they would notice that and I would have to explain that to them.

Also, my coworkers really aren't to blame at all. What they are doing is perfectly normal and everyone other than me would have absolutely no problem with it.

>At home maybe tell your parents your trying to become more independent and if possible have your mom teach you how to cook. Once you learn the basics tell them you want to cook once a week for them. Eventually maybe increase it to two days. Make little by little changes.

1. As I said, this would require me to explain it to them.

2. I really don't care much about food. For me food is a necessary evil and my complete lack of knowledge shows this really well (For example: I have no idea what the difference between a peach and an apricot is, or between a broccoli and a fennel). My parents actually made me cook once a week for over 6 years now."
offmychest,fcnbev1,t1_fcn4htz,1577808013.0,">instead of eating meat switch it for a piece of fish or chicken? Or maybe a pasta?

I wish I could. If I do it at lunch my coworkers would notice and I hate getting attention for something positive. If I do it at dinner, I would have to explain this to my parents.

This is one of the main reasons why I want to change my job. To me, that's the only way how I can actually change what I eat."

offmychest,fcmo9un,t3_ehxijy,1577784045.0,">how can the world possibly be a better place without you in it?

Less hate, less laziness, less people who need to eat which reduces co2 emissions (even more so if that person also eats way too much meat), etc.

>why not strive to be better

I do, but my progress is not just 0, it is actually negative."
softwaregore,fcl4fbx,t1_fckh2r8,1577739579.0,I would still count it as gore because it works differently than expected.
