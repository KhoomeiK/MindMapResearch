The fires are getting worse and worse each year because our government at the moment put a stop to alot of the backburning and another environmental party closed off to many of the fire trails that people use or need to use when there is a fire.

The fires are not the issue, Australia has been naturally doing this since whenever.... our government and their complete disregard for climate change, is the real issue here."
