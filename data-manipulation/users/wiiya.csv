swizzbold,ff6yuag,t3_erw6t5,1579637700.0,"Really excellent and relatable show.  My wife (^TM Borat) was born into very rural, very conservative, Jim Jordan country Ohio, and it wasn't until she went to college that she started a journey away from some of those republican beliefs.  I've been a lifelong democrat that's been nudging her further to the left for the last 10 years we've been together (sometimes she would complain that I do it too much to a point of seeming condescending, to which I'm trying to be better at).  I've even caught her rolling her eyes and clapping back when her parents start spewing some Fox News nonsense.  She voted for Stein in 2016, and now she's *this* close for to vote for a democrat in 2020, I can taste it.  However, she is not at all ready to vote for a Bernie.  Listening to the discussion on the Overton window, Bernie may be the best candidate to try and shift it back (similarly as he did in the 2016 primary).  However, it risks turning off someone like my wife who is progressive-curious, who we absolutely need in battleground states (like Ohio) in the 2020 election.  
  
Half this argument is probably just me personally wanting to vote the same way as my wife for the first time ever.  She's already on board for a Pete or a Biden, but I know even mentioning those names is executable by the lefter echelons of reddit."

starterpacks,ff3suuz,t1_ff3r4mi,1579548114.0,"I want a chart of popular sitcom families by income adjusted for inflation.  
  
Diff'rent Strokes -> The Nanny -> Gilmore Girls -> Fresh Prince -> Cosbys -> Full House -> Modern Family -> Arrested Development -> Brady Bunch -> Step by Step -> Home Improvement -> Martin -> Everybody Loves Raymond -> That 70's show 
 -> Drake and Josh -> Malcolm in the Middle -> Fresh off the Boat -> Family Matters -> Married with Children -> Rosanne  -> Everybody Hates Chris
  
That's just off the top of my head.  
  
Running Edits:  
  
\- Added Malcolm (to roughly the middle...his dad was a low level cubical worker...definitely more than a Chicago cop, but probably less than a Raymond's ""sportswriter"")  
  
\- Keeping Married w/ Children above Rosanne, because that house had definite equity.  
  
\- Full House is coming in at #4 just because of that San Fran house would be worth so much fucking money, and a morning TV personality in a major market is has to make coin.  Not to mention if the other 4 adults living there pitch in, even if Uncle Jesse is a bum half the series.  
  
\- Diff'rent Strokes coming in at #1 because that dad is some bizarre venture capitalist in the 80's and I'm surprised he saw any of the family between the hookers and blow.  I've seen Wolf of Wallstreet, Phillip Drummond.
  
\- Added Fresh off the Boat, somewhere in the middle because I haven't seen it, but they own a middling restaurant that evolves?  Correct me if I'm wrong.  
  
\- Not adding Shameless, because that show is depressing as fuck and by no means a sitcom  
  
\- Everybody Hates Chris is hitting the bottom.  I'm willing to bet Rosanne could get a loan that Terry Crews in Everybody Hates Chris couldn't.  
  
\- Adding Martin (he was a DJ) between Home Improvement's TV personality and Raymond's Sportswriter.  
  
\- Defending Step by Step being above Home Improvement because a local TV personality probably makes less than a contractor and a salon owner's dual income.  Also, Susanne Somers.  
  
\- Get off my lawn with Drake and Josh.  The dad was a meteorologist says the wiki.  I'm putting that before Hal but less than Raymond.  This is officially the most time I've ever typed Raymond.  
  
\- The Nanny coming in at #2.  The dad was a broadway composer ""under the shadow of Andrew Lloyd Webber"", and Webber list listed at $1.2 billion, but I'm still saying still less than 80's Wallstreet money.  
  
\- Gilmore Girls hitting #3 because that grandpa is like the caricature of old money.  Not to mention Lorelia would do pretty by herself, but I'm talking accumulated Gilmore wealth.  
  
\- That 70's show coming in middle-low.  They don't seem super well off, but Red is a retired Factory worker in the 70's.  Probably got a good pension.  
  
\-  I have no idea what to do with Arrested Development.  There is always money in the banana stand, but it's so unclear how far from grace they've fallen.  I'll go lower top 10."
