dogs,ffti4wb,t3_ev1wwz,1580221166.0,Can you work on training and maybe teach her some new tricks? Mental workouts might help tucker her out without putting strain on her injury plus it'll help fight the boredom of reduced activity
dogs,ffthpdv,t3_ev21xk,1580220835.0,"So he thinks that whining, pouting, and yelling at Zoey will get her to like him? I can't really blame Zoey at this point. My dog was definitely ""mine"" at first. I'm the primary care giver and I'm at home a lot more than my husband. She used to mope and whine when I wasn't around. After my husband started feeding her more meals, giving her positive attention, and even worked on her training, their bond grew immensely. Just the other day, she was totally ignoring my calls while out in the yard. Then my husband called her ONCE and she came dashing in! Your fiance needs to put in some effort... probably more than he would've had to originally due to his less-than-optimal behavior so far."

dogs,ffi59ng,t3_etm198,1579965444.0,I think it was less than two weeks for me. It sucked not having a dog around! It worked out really well. Getting my new dog adjusted and trained helped keep me from wallowing in grief. It's been just over a year now and I have absolutely no regrets over not waiting to get a new pooch. She's an awesome dog so she makes it pretty easy!
dogs,ffe67ot,t3_et46fz,1579837773.0,"I lost my 11 year old shiba inu just over a year ago to a brain tumor. He suddenly began having seizures, which lead us to getting a brain scan. It was the type of tumor that went deep into his brain so surgical removal wasn't on the agenda. I opted for palliative care. We had a couple more mostly good months together followed by a steady decline then a rapid decline and the inevitable decision to euthanize him."

pianoteachers,ff742pa,t3_erpwnd,1579640708.0,"NEVER STOP LEARNING. EVER!! That's my top advice.

I earned a BA in music then proceeded to get a normal person day job. I taught piano a few nights a week after work. This went on for over 10 years. Nowadays, I am 100% self-employed and building up my studio.

My personal pros:

* Not having to wake up early! I do anyways because my husband does but I get to keep my pajamas on.
* Setting my own policies, schedule, and curriculum.  I don't typically teach on weekends.
* Choosing where I work.
* Nobody scolds me if I don't reply to an email.
* Making a living doing something I love and plan to keep doing until I drop dead.
* I am fully invested in my work. I actually feel like doing my best and everyone involved benefits when I do!
* Getting to know more people in my community.
* Learning more about the local schools. I don't have kids but I love hearing about the neat things going on in the schools. I help pay for it, after all!
* The hilarious things kids say during lessons.
* Learning is awesome.

My personal cons:

* Taxes. Gross. I'm not so much opposed to paying taxes, I just do not particularly enjoy the record keeping and paperwork part of it.
* Businessy stuff in general, although the more I learn, the less burdensome it feels. The internet helps, more on that below.
* No benefits that might come with traditional employment (health insurance, 401k matching, paid time off, occasional free meals).
* No coworkers (can also be a pro!). I had some truly wonderful people as coworkers in my old job.
* Sick kids. Gross, more gross than taxes. I have an extremely flexible make-up/reschedule policy to help mitigate this, though.
* Traveling to people's houses. I only do this for 3 families and refuse to take any more. They're all great people, it's just extremely inefficient in terms of time, money, and energy. Plus, I prefer teaching at my home studio.
* **Managing my non-teaching schedule**. This is a big one. Most of us have spent the majority of our lives being told what to do when for almost all of our waking hours. It is surprisingly... different and challenging to keep yourself on track when all of those external demands disappear. When I was working a day job, I had to schedule my practice time before or after work. There were no other options. Now that I don't have the strict time constraints of a day job it's been interesting to find a balance that allows me to accomplish what I need to to for my business, my development as a pianist and teacher, and keep the house in order. I feel especially compelled to keep the house in order because my income has dropped significantly since going rogue.  My husband holds more of the financial burden so I try to contribute in other ways while we wait for my income to increase (which it is - yay!). This is really a big one to think about. I was talking about it with my teacher/mentor and she told me that several people dropped of the doctoral program at her school because they simply could not manage their own schedules or realized they hated having to build their own schedules.

Tips/advice:

* Join your local music teacher group! They might even offer a mentor-type setup, where they pair you with a more experienced teacher you can go to for advice. They also hold workshops on various teaching or business topics.
* Join piano teacher groups on facebook (The Art of Piano Pedagogy is an enormous group of teachers of all levels of experience from all over the world).
* Take piano pedagogy and literature courses if they are an option wherever you're doing your piano studies.
* Don't neglect to learn the basics about pop music, improvisation, lead sheets, and jazz.
* Automate whatever you can. I use [MyMusicStaff](https://www.mymusicstaff.com/) for billing and scheduling. Parents and adult students can reschedule their lessons and pay invoices online. It's easier for them and for me.
* Take online payments. Yes, there is a fee. However, the money just magically shows up in your account. It's nice to not have to drive to the bank or worry about misplacing a check. Autopay is even better. As stated above, I do this through MyMusicStaff. I've heard of others using [Acuity](https://acuityscheduling.com/) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/website-design/?channel=pbr&subchannel=go&campaign=pbr-dr-go-us-en-squarespace-core-e&subcampaign=(brand-core_squarespace_e)&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pbr&utm_campaign=pbr-dr-go-us-en-squarespace-core-e&utm_term=squarespace&gclid=CjwKCAiA35rxBRAWEiwADqB37xwaCjC8vbervG99k3z-A7oI5lSriIZQ3XE5MBfwfBtl04RKKOncLxoCNAgQAvD_BwE).
* Really think about your business structure. I started out as a sole proprietor but registered as an LLC after I got married. There is more protection as an LLC. Maybe talk to a CPA, small business lawyer, or a local entrepreneur group for better advice.
* Build a website! It doesn't have to be a work of art or have a billion pages - just a home page, lessons page, and contact page will do. Wordpress, Squarespace, and Wix are a few of the options our there.
* Learn about marketing. In Field of Dreams, they said ""If you build it, they will come."" Inspiring quote but it's lousy advice for starting up a business. I learned that the hard way. Take a look at  [https://growyourmusicstudio.com/](https://growyourmusicstudio.com/) for some piano studio specific marketing information. I also took his marketing training, which has already paid for itself. My setup is pretty bare bones but it's gotten me more new students in a month than I got in a year before I went through the training.

The things you want to do will always be packaged with things you do NOT want to do. For me, doing the things I don't want to do are a small price to pay for the privilege of having my own piano teaching studio. Despite the challenges that come with self-employment, I have absolutely no desire to go back to a regular job. That being said, this type of life isn't for everyone and there is nothing wrong with having a traditional job."
