aww,fembpos,t3_eprm7x,1579247536.0,A very rare dirty cloud. Most clouds are clean.
aww,fembky2,t1_fem7hqe,1579247369.0,"Apparently, it was their daughters dog whom she left with her parents. They could have surrendered her to a shelter instead of dumping her on the road.  I don't think they ever wanted her. Why the daughter chose to leave the dog with her parents we may never know."
aww,fejzs77,t3_ephs8n,1579189539.0,RIP to your controller. It belongs to your kitten meow.
jailbreak,fecjv03,t1_febz08l,1578975676.0,"It's all good. What I meant is that by charging back Packix was taking the hit(because the payment is going through them), not the developer."
jailbreak,febvl1q,t1_feak9im,1578963222.0,"I agree that the dev should refund OP. One last thing: Whilst PayPal protects the buyer, it doesn't always side with them(sometimes the seller wins if they can prove that the claim made was unsubstantiated)."
jailbreak,feajy7z,t1_fea91fy,1578949720.0,That's fucking over packix. A Dev denying a refund isn't necessarily the repos fault.
Android,fe95s65,t1_fe7u9wk,1578934557.0,That ain't gonna happen. They love to try to push their apps on users.
jailbreak,fe6l82w,t1_fe6ev9y,1578894621.0,Correct.

HaggardGarage,fcwm3u2,t1_fcwfagt,1578029477.0,They’re talking about Android reddit apps. Apollo is for iOS.

Gameboy,fck58hq,t3_ehjy69,1577716953.0,The Gameboy Micro can only play Gameboy Advance games. I’d recommend getting something older if you want to play GB/GBC games.

aww,fbxrsdf,t1_fbxhz0h,1577198730.0,Dogs shed for a reason. Shaving them can do more harm than good. Uou brush them to help get rid of their 2nd coat in the summertime.
aww,fbxrpj9,t1_fbxqbfm,1577198667.0,You’re supposed to brush them to get rid of knots... These dogs(double coated) should not be shaved unless its mandatory(IE surgery/matted so bad there’s no other choice). Making your dog look ‘cuter’ is not mandatory.
aww,fbxrd09,t1_fbwzyv2,1577198382.0,"Technically hes not handling him. That would imply him picking th cat up, which he is not doing."
jailbreak,fbx2t0p,t1_fbw82xy,1577167094.0,Can’t agree more. The only thing it’s missing is the ability to hide sections of a repo.
HaggardGarage,fbur72q,t3_eemf9t,1577119063.0,Jimmy: cuts civic to make room for s13 trans.
