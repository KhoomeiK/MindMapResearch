You can put your disks wherever you want, they don't have to be on a windowsill. No one suggested that at all here, don't be so cranky and narrow-minded.

You don't even need a powered usb hub if you're already using an enclosure with your drives on the pi. I assume they have their own power since a pi can't power them all either. Again, problem solved.

I didn't notice you're also running plex on the pi so that might come as a poorer choice for the tablet but then again, it does offer DLNA through the plex app so realistically, you wouldn't even need samba, it would just read the local files off disk. Transcoding would be bad on either platform so meh. i'll admit it's not ideal.

As for your ""dashboard"" apps, There are lots and Lots and LOTS of apps that do that for your home page and are VERY customizable down to the pixel. I haven't used one in a while but i'm sure i can find a few in my list of apps on the app store. It really wouldn't look bad, i assure you. 

As for your last point, i think you're confused. At no point did i mention monitoring a pi with another pi. PiMonitor is an android app that monitors pis on your network. There's at least half a dozen others that are decent but i find pimonitor and raspicheck to be the best(in that order). Pis and harddrives aren't noisy these days so unless you're running SCSI drives or have a problem with hiding a few cables under the desk you have that sitting on, i don't see an issue with my practical suggestion. 

In the end, i'm only mentioning any of this so you can free up the pi to fiddle with on other things. I'm trying to *help* my dude, i haven't insulted your effort once. What i've suggested would work fine and doesn't have to look like ass. You just need to know where to look.

Your way is fine too, i just thought you might like to free up a device is all. You do you man."
raspberry_pi,ffvy9po,t1_ffvvffz,1580277037.0,"Everything. It's an android tablet and is capable of everything a pi can do and more. (sofware wise anyways) You can even install linux in a bit of a nerfed capacity on there. Hell, i'm pretty sure the Nexus 10 has an OTG port that can support a powered hub and it can even act as a file server for multiple drives.

It already has a weather app and there are dozens of system monitor apps for both linux and windows on android. I use remote system monitor and just put the weather in the notification bar. You can adjust that as you wish as long as you're running android 5.0. Pi Manager is already an android app and can pull an awful lot of information from it like storage and CPU/RAM usage and will even show it live.  


i'm just pointing out that the pi isn't required for anything you've mentioned here so you could realistically gain a pi out of this if you wanted to.

GoogleWiFi,ffvu8ng,t3_evgp6w,1580273411.0,"okay, so WPS is considered REALLY insecure now so google refuses to include it on their wifi units. That sucks for your printer, i know. But you might have a solution available.  


Assuming no extra bits are happening with WPS, You should have your ISP modem/router wifi named exactly the way you will be naming your GWifi SSID. Same password, same everything.  


Don't have your GWifi on yet. Connect the printer with WPS to the ISP router and then turn it off. Put your ISP router back into bridge mode so it passes all DHCP and DNS to the GWifi. This is the ideal setup for GWifi. Once your wifi SSID is named the same as your router's, theoretically, your printer will join the new network with the same SSID and password."

Call Netgear and have them walk you through the process of bridging your Internet to the GWifi."

GoogleWiFi,fe03b2a,t1_fdzzud7,1578802009.0,"Your ISP should absolutely be able to help you with putting THEIR product into Bridge mode. It's what they provided after all.

Moving on, you followed the instructions, which i have no knowledge of but if i had to guess, it told you to go to some advanced settings, Pick a port on the router to bridge, then click apply yes?

If it did that, then you need to have your Google wifi plugged in to that port and everything else on your network plugged into the google wifi. That's how Gwifi works. If you think this is too complicated then you can either reset your modem to factory settings and start over, or you can try contacting google support and have them walk you through it with your ISP. They are in a much better position to help you with products i don't have access to. I only have the google wifi units and a career in IT support. But i have never heard of an ISP that will not help you operate the hardware they provided."

GoogleWiFi,fdmmy4t,t1_fdmh1wm,1578556145.0,"That makes no sense. First you say you have gwifi, then you say you don't have any pucks. You can't NOT have at least one puck. Puck is just a word we use in the industry for Gwifi nodes since the original devices look puck shaped. I'll clarify : The old Gwifi has pucks, the new NEST wifi has a main router NODE and 2 Satellites (though you may not have those) And i'm just asking if you DO have them and if you can move one closer to your room.
Help me out here and extrapolate.

Do you have 2 playstations in the house?"
GoogleWiFi,fdmgg68,t1_fdmfox2,1578549060.0,"Your phone and your PS4 have different wifi capabilities. There's so many other factors at play with wifi strength. How many walls it has to travel through decreases it's strength each time. Any EMI from the PS4 or the tv causes issues as well. Your PS4 could be on 5Ghzwifi while your phone could be on 2.4Ghz. 5Ghz is great for speed but has to be line of sight with no obstacles for best use. 2.4 is used by virtually everything and can go through objects much easier than 5ghz. Think of it as a wave. A smoother, gentler wave can get around and through obstacles easier than a tighter, rougher wave can. Basically, 5ghz hits more particles in a wall as it travels through than 2.4 does.

And that's just type of signal. Your tv gives off 2.4ghz EMI which would interfere with wifi. Same with a microwave or cordless phone. 

Not to mention, the PS4 has to be able to communicate back through all those walls so if it can't tell loud enough but it can hear fine...you get slow internet. Try checking your PS4 network settings and if you have the option choose 2.4ghz. im pretty sure GWifi does auto switching so you might be hooped. If you have another GWifi puck, you could try moving it closer."

GoogleWiFi,fdm8qfd,t1_fdm7r2h,1578542597.0,"Yes, the general term for GWifi units is a puck.

60-70% is just signal strength but isn't a great indicator for what speeds you're getting. 

You say you have access to the GWifi app. It has a device speed test option. Run that and tell me what you get for the PlayStation."
