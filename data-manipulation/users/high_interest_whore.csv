worldnews,ffckdyr,t3_erfcm7,1579801322.0,"Late to the party, but I see and experience this every day. I too dont see working hard as a way to get ahead. Why? Because of all of the jobs I've held over the last 13 years only one has given me a pay raise that wasn't union mandated (that was pre set before i was hired) or a state minimum wage increase. And that one job only gave me a $0.25 an hour increase over the course of working there 3 years. My field and skill set are very in demand right now. I will only give 50-75% on any given day, because I know the company wont pay me more. They will just expect me to do more for the same pay."

worldnews,fe8udu7,t3_emetoy,1578931041.0,Maybe I am dumb but how can a country “allegedly” launch a missile at a flight containing citizens of another country without severe punishment. So many lives lost and families devastated. Fucked up.

worldnews,fdysmf4,t3_em2dso,1578783168.0,"This reminds me of the wildfires here in Fort McMurray back in 2016. Over 100,000 people evacuated at the same moment of time on a single highway out of town. They said the fire never claimed any lives and maybe it didn't, but there was a  fatal car accident due to the fire. I find it quite disrespectful to not honour the two people who died evacuating."
