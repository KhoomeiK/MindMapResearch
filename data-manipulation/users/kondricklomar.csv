Get into tech sales. Work for a wireless carrier or cable giant. Itll suck but you'll make enough to live"
AskReddit,ferkof6,t3_eq9k9o,1579355138.0,Bob Dylan. Saw him at firefly in 2017? 2018 maybe? He was just too old. I missed the boat and it sucked.

It all became more about CYA and less about genuine intent.. idk if it's like that across the board or just where I was. Good on you either way for your work. It is probably often thankless but this internet stranger is appreciative from afar. Take care of yourself"
