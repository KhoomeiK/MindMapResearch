It's been a while since those times so I don't remember everyone I met, but I remember being friends with this guy who would do like the perfect impression of Quagmire and Herbert from Family Guy, and it used to always crack me up. He was really cool and really funny. We were friends for a while, I think we even added eachother on Facebook too back when it was still relevant. Life kinda got in the way eventually however and I ended up having to sell my Xbox and other belongings and we fell out of touch. Seeing this post kinda brought back memories. I miss him. I miss all of the people I had met back then, life was so different and less stressful.

depression,fc7mgne,t3_egmgy2,1577512279.0,"You're not childish, dumb, or selfish. I understand how you feel, because I too feel the same way. Relationships can be pretty hard to maintain sometimes, especially when you're depressed and have a lot going on. Sometimes it feels like people only care about themselves and what they have to say, like no one ever really bothers to actually listen nowadays. Everyone is so preoccupied with their own lives that they often don't care to hear about anyone else's, and it's tough for us because we don't wanna be a burden to anyone. Personally I feel like everyone should have at least one special person to vent to and be able to have deep and thoughtful conversations with, but it's often hard to find people who you can actually feel comfortable talking to. I've distanced myself from all of my friends because I felt the same way you did, and I no longer had the energy to hang out with them just to talk about the same old day to day nonsense. I've kinda been alone since, haven't really made any new friends due to not having any common interests, and I don't really have much family aside from my mother and sister. With me being the only male figure around, it kinda makes it difficult for me to wanna talk about my feelings with them. It's frustrating when there's no one around to really talk to despite there being so many people around and about. And the depression just makes everything worse too. 

Depression. That's the key problem here, for a lot of us. If you don't mind me asking (and I'll understand if you do), why are you feeling depressed?"
