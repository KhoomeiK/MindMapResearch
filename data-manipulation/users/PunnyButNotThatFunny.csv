AskReddit,fcphhnj,t1_fcph50f,1577864286.0,"I usually see people struggling with opiates, crack etc. Psychedelics are only a problem in my eyes if you have a history of psychosis or a low mental threshold so I think its important to know your family and self history on that subject. Im not super educated on the subject but I fear it could exuberant preexisting conditions or trigger new ones predetermined by someones genes etc. I think you need to be able to mentally handle that type of thing but if you can, I think it can be great, and I've even seen studies to use it to help with mental illness such as depression and PTSD in small doses. It can also create alot of creativity and life changing spiritual awakening. That being said tho, I still wouldnt reccomend it to someone I've never met."
AskReddit,fcpgdv8,t1_fcpfuzr,1577862820.0,"Let me say the first part tho, about not taking risks and regretting it DOES NOT INCLUDE SAYING NO TO DRUGS! Always say no. You will not regret it. Others may seem like they're having more fun and you might feel like you're missing out etc but in the long run you will save yourself so many years of struggle, money and time with rehab etc. Just dont do it.

The rest is spot on. Just be good to people. Find your high from treating people kindly. For me, karma always came full circle. 
The part I would add is always be vigilant and look out for red flags when meeting new people or starting new relationships. Learn/know your worth and continue to improve everyday and dont feel bad for cutting out people who dont fit your standards for your own peace and happiness."
