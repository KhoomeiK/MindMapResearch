[This recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/650xr6/fp_i_am_excited_to_share_with_you_the_best_low/) gave me the BEST keto bread.  Yes you have to do it yourself, but it's miles and miles better than Sola, ThinSlim etc."
ketorecipes,ff58bzs,t1_ff5667v,1579583222.0,"I second Urvashi Pitre.  Her stuff is usually very easy and tasty.  Her low carb biryani (cauli rice) is one of my favorite meals.  I add a few extra veg to it, usually frozen green beans, but aside from that addition I follow it exactly. Very flavorful.
