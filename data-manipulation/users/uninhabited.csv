IIRC there are a couple of hundred different HMOs which is quite incredible.

They've just started synthesising some of them. Don't think any are being made commercially yet but this would probably be the aim. The speaker talks about caesarian-section births and how these babies do not get the bacteria they need from the birth canal and can have lower-functioning immune systems as a result. The plan is (I think) to add HMOs to their food - so yes baby formula - and get their microbiome up to scratch"
