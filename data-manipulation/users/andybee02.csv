I was surprised how similar they were given the vastly different builds (and stereo vs. mono). Devialet had a more “exciting” sound, more bass extension plus high treble, whereas KEF was more neutral, clearer across frequencies. Wish I could keep both and use Devialet for rock, R&B, modern jazz, and pop, then use KEF for choral, classical, and historical jazz. I’m currently torn though.... I like the idea of an all-in-one package, no attached sub or wires (minus the optical from the turntable input) and might update to a stereo system with Devialet down the road, but hard to justify the 30% premium in price when the KEF sounds almost just as good on its own."
