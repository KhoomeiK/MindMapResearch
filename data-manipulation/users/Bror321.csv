If you answeard yes there is something very wrong with you and you should seek help from someone more qualified. The mbti personality typer never suggested that it would give you any of the things your asking for so why are expecting it? that's like thinking you would get chocolate on your ice cream but you went to a pizza place. The personality type is just a categorization of people not even backed by science, and should be taking with a grain of salt."
