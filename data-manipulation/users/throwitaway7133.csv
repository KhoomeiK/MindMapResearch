stopdrinking,ffcn0am,t3_estl6n,1579802909.0,"My heart hurts for you in this distraction. I have issues with drinking but have also been a partner to an alcoholic and I know how difficult it can be. You’ve already gotten some great advice.

For me, it was important to get my underlying mental health in order to tackle drinking. So my partner being supportive of me seeking counseling and a psychiatrist was helpful. It sounds like you are extremely supportive already which is great. 

Another thing that is helpful to me is when my partner refrains from having alcohol in the house. Of course that decision is between you and your spouse, but not having the alcohol in the house makes it much easier for me when a craving hits.

And as others have suggested, I think counseling or a support group (or continuing here!) would be helpful. I know for me, both my drinking and my anxiety got much worse when I was with my ex who drank. So even though your partner might not be willing to get help, you can focus on your own health!

One thing that I think could be helpful if you haven’t tried it is to be clear (but not placing blame) how his drinking I’m affecting you and your relationship. I often would tell my ex that I wanted him to be happy and healthy. But now that I have my own issues, I understand that you really don’t care about yourself too much when you were drinking. My partner expressing how he felt disconnected and neglected etc helped pull me out of myself a little.

I wish I had a perfect solution for you but this situation plain sucks. Your partner is very lucky to have you. Sending good vibes your way."

writing,feod1ii,t3_eq5stz,1579298442.0,"Some people really enjoy complex/abstract prose. They might enjoy literary fiction. Some people enjoy really complex puzzles and shocking twists they would never have seen coming. They might read a mystery crime novel. Some people like sprawling casts of characters with long, dynamic plots. They might choose epic fantasy.

Of course things aren’t so clear cut but there are many styles, genres, tones, etc. This post kind of seems to be saying that if a book doesn’t line up with you the OP’s personal preference, then it is not quality work. Which is of course not at all the case.

Another thing to consider is that many readers simply read to be entertained. As long as it’s fun, they don’t care if the characters get a bit too complex. That’s why series like Wheel of Time or GoT are mega hits. Some people like unreliable narrators who obscure facts - which is why there was a huge surge of psychological thrillers with unreliable narrators a few years ago.

There were bad writers writing alongside Dostoyevsky and Melville just like there are good and bad writers today."

When you go back and edit your piece, you will probably find things that can be cut. If you haven’t, I’d also recommend reading up on various story structures. I personally like the Save the Cat structure and Take Off Your Pants! By Libbie Hawker is a good resource. Good luck!"

ADHD,femo7f9,t3_epket8,1579264453.0,"You could always get a second opinion. If a second doctor agrees with the diagnosis that might help you feel better!

I haven’t been diagnosed - I have an evaluation at the end of January. So take my post with a grain of salt! 

I’m in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist for meds. I have tried all manner of medications. This is my second psychiatrist. And my third counselor. (Just an aside - CBT works super well for me! Might help someone else!)

In therapy my counselor asked if I ever considered I could have ADHD. She said as I had been discussing my anxiety, a lot of my triggers and struggles were common with people with ADHD.

So I guess I just want to say, it is possible that have anxiety or depression relating to your ADHD, but it doesn’t mean you don’t have ADHD. I know for me both are often triggered by my complete inability to maintain household tasks, work, and personal projects.

I never felt different per se in childhood. But I have had lifelong struggles with organization and focus. It’s important to remember that no two people will have the exactly same experience.

Good luck!"

writing,fejpfvr,t3_epi4z4,1579182440.0,"Based on the little you’ve described to me, it sounds like maybe there isn’t a clear goal for your character. It’s not a thematic question of “what’s it about”, but more “why should we care about this character?” I had this issue when I was first writing.

Fantasy,feim9yr,t3_epcos9,1579141845.0,"Love this! I most recently finished The City in the Middle of the Night by Charlie Jane Anders. She is quickly becoming one of my favorites! I love that she includes diverse characters in a way that feels natural to the story. Her world building is interesting as well. The story is set on a planet where half the planet experiences eternal day and the other eternal night. Not too out of the box, but the way she fleshed out the world was so intriguing to me. I will say the ending isn’t particularly...wrapped up. But that’s my favorite kind of ending! However, I know it’s not for everyone.

I was reading The Passage by Justin Cronin but it sadly expired and was on hold at the library. The character building was amazing from the small part I read and I’m excited to get back to it.

Anxiety,fdrek5x,t3_emta1g,1578683437.0,"Your doctor will likely have a recommendation. Depending on how your anxiety manifests, SSRIs are often a first line. When my anxiety was a bit milder Lexapro worked very well for me with no side effects. Hydroxyzine has worked in the past as well for anxiety and insomnia. There are lots of classes of meds to try though."
Anxiety,fdrbljw,t3_emubug,1578682112.0,"I’m really sorry you are going through this. I definitely relate - my relationship is very rocky right now and a lot of it is relating to my anxiety and depression.

Are you working with a counselor right now? It sounds like it might be helpful for your overall anxiety and would definitely be a great resource for support after the breakup. My counselor specializes in CBT and that’s been working well for my anxiety.

Hope you feel better soon. Sending good vibes your way."
Fantasy,fdraqed,t1_fdr9jx8,1578681814.0,Thanks for the info!
mentalhealth,fdrahdm,t3_emuqf5,1578681669.0,Definitely go to the doctor ASAP! It can be dangerous to not keep water down. It is likely something mild (sounds like food poisoning) but you definitely want to check with a doctor!
Fantasy,fdr9e2j,t1_fdr8goo,1578681285.0,Is this about a girl who is maybe a slave and has no arms? Or maybe one arm amputated? I saw a kickass graphic novel at a book shop on a staff rec and could not remember the name - but this might be it!
Anxiety,fdqkue1,t3_emr4z6,1578669094.0,"This sounds very frustrating. I have chronic pain and know it can be difficult when you don’t feel heard by your doctor. So I have a few thoughts!

Has your doctor done any basic tests? Bloodwork is common to do when anxiety is a possibility to rule out underlying concerns. If you aren’t confident in your doctor you could get a second opinion.

However, I have anxiety and have a lot of stomach issues related to it. When I’m severely anxious I have stomach pain, sever nausea and dry heaving. It’s not uncommon for me to lose weight as a result. Have you considered trying SSRIs to see if they help? Your doctor suggesting anxiety is the cause does NOT mean your pain is not real. It might just have a different cause than you suspect. I have no side effects from SSRIs so they might be worth trying!"
mentalhealth,fdq9roc,t3_emmgkq,1578660485.0,SSRIs have helped me a ton with depression. I would not be functional without them. I took Lexapro for a while and it was amazing and I had no side effects. I’m on Zoloft now and it also seems to have minimal side effects for me! Also keep in mind if you don’t love how a med makes you feel you can always let your doctor know and try something else. Good luck!
mentalhealth,fdom0nj,t3_emguil,1578607873.0,"I understand why you are hesitant, but only a mental health professional could diagnose you. Based on what you describe, it could be a number of things going on. If you are in the US your school might have a counselor you could speak to."
Fantasy,fdoljgj,t1_fdoitwq,1578607591.0,"I didn’t think the post was judgemental at all.  For me it’s just a reminder that I go to the same places for most of my reading recommendations, and those recommendations are often very similar, and are often made by people with fairly similar tastes. There is a lot of great fiction we might overlook if we don’t challenge ourselves to go and find it.

Nothing about that makes me feel judged."
