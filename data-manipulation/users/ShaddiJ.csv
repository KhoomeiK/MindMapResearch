NatureIsFuckingLit,fgs2dml,t3_f06bbl,1581068015.0,I've never seen snow either.  Is it as soft as it looks or does it feel like the frost out of the freezer?
sydney,fgrcsrb,t1_fgr9unv,1581043665.0,"We'll have a look there, thank you!"
sydney,fgrcr4z,t1_fgrbaht,1581043635.0,Thank you!  We'll start looking there
sydney,fgrbdtt,t1_fgra0qh,1581042701.0,They're rice based.  The most info I could get on them are that they are suppose to have 5 grains in them
sydney,fgr6x9e,t1_fgr6kaw,1581039641.0,"Haha, I won't deny it.  But they are delicious :)"
sydney,fgr2xm1,t3_f024it,1581036953.0,Thank you!  I was worried that it got burnt down during the fires and hadn't heard anything.  I love the pies there and like to stop by when I'm in the area.
AntsCanada,fglmtw9,t3_ez43lh,1580904756.0,"According to Wikipedia nuptial flights only happen during the warmer months.  That being said if the ants are inside a warm house all the time, that may effect when they have their flights.  Ants are not set to a month by month schedule, they take their ques from their environment. Since your ants are from a warmer climate, they may have decided now was a good time.  

I suggest checking everywhere and maybe putting some ant baits down if you're worried they are in your house but with another colony nearby to supply males, you may be just fine."
legaladvice,fgezq6e,t3_ey0p4z,1580716838.0,"Pity, that would have been perfect. They could claim that they left as soon as you entered so it may be hard to prove how long they were in your apartment.  Don't wait for a next time, by then it may be too late.  Keep an eye on your credit and set up an Nanny cam that covers as much of the apparent as possible.  They may very well try to come in again, but somehow I think they got what they were looking for."
legaladvice,fgeum4k,t1_fgeskh4,1580710608.0,That's the sort of proof you need to take to the police.  Did it also pick up you asking the to leave and how long it took?  Also speak with the building management about getting a proper lock for your door.  If anyone in the building can get it that's simply not safe.
nope,fgeubey,t1_fge83fs,1580710284.0,That's what I was thinking.  They don't look like bees to me at all.  Wasps more likely
Cooking,fg9eety,t3_exdsgp,1580637653.0,"While I can't watch the videos right now, I went ahead and subscribed.  I read through some of the video list and it all sounds really good.  It's always interesting how people cook differently, even if it's just little changes.  I look forward to watching them when I get home"
entitledparents,fg98n2l,t3_exllzh,1580635623.0,"Sounds like a kid that use to pick on my little sister.  Kept changing schools because he was being 'picked on' aka he got in trouble for bullying the other children.  His mother would blame the victims, saying her son was an angel.  Even went so far as to claim my sister had beat him up when they got off the bus- she was half his size and very quiet.  Last I heard of him he got expelled from my sister's high school for sexually harassing female students."
socialanxiety,fg7d3ym,t1_fg6wwxg,1580589613.0,"Or when people say you don't talk much.  No, I just don't like you."
socialanxiety,fg7ctn2,t3_ex37pq,1580589421.0,"Sounds like they weren't the best of friends.  Think if it this way - you are now free of them and no longer have to try and please their sense of what is right for you to do.  You've gotten better but not because of them.  You're better because of what you did.  If they can't see that, then they are the ones missing the social ques"
socialanxiety,fg7ccpk,t3_ex9kwk,1580589103.0,"Make sure you've got everything ready for school so you're not searching for things. Making yourself rushes out the door won't help. Go to sleep.  It's much easier to face something you don't want to when you're well rested.  Make sure you have a filling breakfast, I find being hungry makes my anxiety worst.  Tell yourself the day will go well.  Try and pick out things about your day that was good- got a good seat in class, knew the answer to a question, said hello to someone, anything."
socialanxiety,fg7bgk6,t3_ex6ybn,1580588491.0,"You can refuse to go.  Simply saying ""If friend 1 and friend 2 isn't going, then I'm not.  I was only going to go because of you and I don't know your boyfriend well enough to spend the night out alone with him.  Sorry, but maybe next time we can go out.""

If they push back against that then keep to your guns and try to be the one that invites them all out next time to a movie or something else you'll all enjoy."
legaladvice,ffxdefx,t3_evodic,1580322859.0,"If you were legally separated when you brought the house, then I'm pretty sure she has no claim.  The idea of legal separation is in part that you no longer own each other's stuff.

 She can't claim half of her ex-husband's house just because she lived there for a year. Technically speaking she was a tenet -one that didn't pay rent- and she left the house on her own accord.  

Chances are she just wants more money out of you.  Wait to see if she does try to file anything, make sure you've got all the paperwork in good order and make sure to show up in court if need be.  Maybe speak to the lawyer that did your separation to make sure everything is in order."
Cooking,ffxbfue,t3_evol29,1580321712.0,A punnet of fresh strawberries should not be 2/3 rotten.  I'd go back and ask for either a refund or more strawberries.
sydney,ffxa6zg,t3_evoy14,1580320966.0,Thank you for this.  It's crazy how fast and far it's spreading.
whatisthisthing,ffwhqhl,t1_ffwae85,1580301418.0,Had a look at the photos and I think you're on to something there.  I think the brouch looks very similar to the person in the second image.
AntsCanada,ffwf3qc,t1_ffweql6,1580298633.0,In that case they'd be majors or super majors.  Specialized workers ment to defend the nest and do heavy work.   Still a cool find.  They simply don't have the swollen abdomen a queen would have.  A queen's abdomen can be twice the length of the rest of the body.
AntsCanada,ffweoo1,t3_evh5p2,1580298143.0,Those three and probably workers from what you've said and by the looks of them.  You'll need to post a better picture since all we can see is black outlines.
Cooking,ffv7vyb,t1_ffv6q4r,1580257789.0,"Zucchini slice is made with eggs, flour and cheese.  It travels well and can be eaten hot or cold."
Cooking,ffuzupm,t3_evanzw,1580252528.0,"Zucchini slice maybe?  You can put whatever vegetable you want in it, add cooked bacon or cooked chicken.  With a little prep it's easy to throw together and you can eat it warm for dinner and the leftovers are great for lunch the next few days. 
Also homemade what pasta sauce is easy to make with butter, flour, milk and parmesan cheese.  Again you can add whatever veggies and meat you like to it and you're good to go."
filipinofood,ffs5y3v,t3_eut52j,1580173954.0,That looks so good.  Please post the recipe!
melbourne,ffpc5vo,t3_eu4218,1580091378.0,My heart goes out to the people in the locked down city.  How scary it must be for them to have to try ans wait out the virus knowing that it can kill if you catch it but have no way of knowing who has it and no way of escaping it.
