Learn about filtration of water and air. Basic understanding of electricity and what you can use it for, for example generation of electricity and conversion of it.

To many these things are useful throughout life and you still get to think about the what if situations. But you are learning and more capable of dealing with the fears and worry, if you know of solutions to problems.

Edit: Auto fill sucks sometimes"
China_Flu,fgjiqxf,t3_eyttf9,1580844890.0,"First, get off this sub and reddit for your mental health.

Second, right now if you are worried about getting sick from this in the US you need to evaluate the actual risks. You are buying into others paranoia and it's of no benefit to you or your family.

I'm close to 40 and have had pneumonia twice and yes it really fucking sucks. Letting depression control you is worse  and it's a hole it took me a very long time to dig myself out of. Considering my best friend died, my cousin closer to me than my own brother, and grandfather in 3 months time and spent 15 years trying to help one of the best people I've ever known to get off of pills and accept the fact that I couldn't.

Remove yourself from your fears about this. Be smart about it and if things get really bad remember it will get better. Focus on the good in life and appreciate it because we all end up in the same place anyway might as well try to enjoy the time we have.

Instead of being on here and it contributing to your depression you can educate yourself about skills needed if cities were on a lock down here. Many things that you can learn right now and think of it as a hobby.

For example can you cook? I mean cook well from the basics like flour, corn meal, rice, beans. Understand water filtration and positive pressure air filtration and how they work.

I'm not a prepper I'm a field and mechanical engineer and former master tech with a degree in science. I'm just trying to say if things get actually bad you can still enjoy life and enjoy time with family and friends. Focusing on the bad and feeling hopeless won't help anyone. If you understand some simple concepts it can give you confidence, a purpose, and improve the lives of you and your friends and family.

Don't give up on your job or anything yet. But you have a interest it seems in what it takes if things get bad. Learn, be confident, and your fears and depression will get better. And if cities do start lock downs then go to your family well supplied and knowing that you can help and not hinder them. And then enjoy your free time with them, because it's always a regret if you don't when people are gone. And we will all be gone someday."
