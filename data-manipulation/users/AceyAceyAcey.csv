Meanwhile, feel the drooping leaves.  Are they soft and squishy, or firm like they usually are?  Ditto the stem.  If they're soft, it's probably rot."

Harassment generally involves words, facial expressions, or touching their own body **but not yours**, and usually it has to be a repeated pattern (though there are cases where a single incident can count). Because it usually requires repetition, the term sexual harassment usually is relevant in a workplace environment."
relationship_advice,ffaceze,t1_ffa8bhi,1579732245.0,"If you don’t want to divorce his rapey ass, I suggest....

1) Not right after he crosses the line but some other separate time, sit down and have a conversation that this is not acceptable behavior. Explicitly tell him this is sexual assault. Put that label on it. Be rude about it. 
2) Tel him you’re both going to couples counseling. Don’t take no for an answer. 
3) Come up with a system of escalating consequences for his actions and stick to it. For example, next time he does it, immediately leave the room for an hour. If you’re in the middle of cooking, turn off the heat and leave. If you’re changing the baby’s diapers, hand the baby to him and leave. Just make it clear you will not be around someone who violates your boundaries like this. The second time he does it, leave the house overnight. Go to a hotel, stay with friends or family, or find a women’s shelter. This is important to you, and you need to make that clear. The third time after your talk that he does it, leave for a week. Then a month. Then a year. 

To be clear, when I call him “rapey”, I’m not saying what he did is necessarily rape, but it’s on the same spectrum: he’s violating your person by touching you sexually, not only without your permission, but even against your explicit “No.” If he’d done it to a stranger, it’d be sexual assault. In many jurisdictions if he’s sticking his finger in your anus while you say “no”, even if you’re dating or are married, that would legally be considered rape. I highly doubt he’s forgetting, I expect he remembers but gets a kick out of violating your boundaries. You need to stop this now before his “oh, I forgot you don’t like me shoving a finger up your ass while you’re cooking,” becomes “oh, I forgot you don’t like me non-consensually holding you down and forcing you to have sex with me.”"

You are not setting boundaries, you’re being controlling. Controlling is telling him what to do, as you have.

People who are minorities report a lot more of this going on, both within their/our fields, and when interacting with laypeople who think they somehow magically know more than someone doing a graduate degree in the field."

I've got really dark brown towards black hair, [around a 2 on this chart](http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1V3nvJVXXXXbrXpXXq6xXFXXXb/200956607/HTB1V3nvJVXXXXbrXpXXq6xXFXXXb.jpg?size=152863&height=803&width=800&hash=dbdd6829decf1200e8224de2145ca681), and I have to bleach even if I want a medium brown (like #6 on that)."

Seeing suddenly poor grades is one way that parents know something is going on with their children.  So you would be an asshole for...

1. Lying to your parents
2. Hiding the fact that you need extra academic help
3. Hiding the fact that you need extra emotional support

Plus your parents can always find out by going to the school."

Edit: If you haven't gotten a vet checkup, please do.  Ask for a nail clipping, as those are waaaaay overgrown.  Don't do them yourself without being shown how and how to stop bleeding, as the quick (vein in the nail) has probably grown out quite far by this point.

1. Can you describe the pot a bit more, it's hard to see from the photo.  Does it have a hole in the bottom?  Is it terracotta (aka unglazed ceramic) that absorbs water well, or does it have a shiny finish and does not absorb water at all?  
2. How do you know when to water?  Is it based on what the plant looks like, how the soil is, or amount of time passed?
3. How often do you typically water?  
4. When you do water, how do you go about watering?  From the top, from the bottom, misting?  
5. How do you know how much water to give it?  Do you water from the top until it runs out the bottom, water from the top until it looks right, water from the bottom until it stops soaking up more, mist it until it looks pretty?"

* You have great childhood memories of going to cinemas, theaters, theme parks, or whatever, except they were never places you or other non-narcs in the family wanted to go to, and always only places the narcissist wanted to go to. (Like the vacations one.) 
* You remember being endlessly supported when things went wrong, except the “support” was actually a debrief on how to fix what you did wrong. 
* You always had to leave for events on their schedule. If the narc was ready before everyone else, this was a Problem. If everyone else was ready before the narc, you waited. 
* Your nparent endlessly supported your medical health, but as you aged and should have been growing into making your own medical decisions, they continued to make the decisions for you without consulting your opinions, and they were surprised when you wrested control of your own medical decisions from them."
