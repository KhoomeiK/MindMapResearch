TrollYChromosome,ffiglsd,t1_ffifogq,1579973385.0,"Not disagreeing. There are no absolutes. My point was this comment is usually geared at women. By margin men “cheat”(get caught?) more than women. It’s also more socially acceptable for men to cheat. So if you think what she said was dumb( which it is) it’s to show how often women are told the cheating was their fault in some way.  Satire.

doordash_drivers,fdlxzfp,t1_fdlxrj5,1578535177.0,You didn’t misinterpret. They literally jumped off the deep end because of your question when their advice could have easily just been “ ask a professional”.Some people get their daily self esteem from acting like weirdos on the internet. It was a good question and gave me some insight. Thanks!
