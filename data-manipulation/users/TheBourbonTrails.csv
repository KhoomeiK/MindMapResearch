cubancigars,ff7fkyw,t1_ff789st,1579648406.0,"Well, I smoked a couple right out of the cab, and put the others in the vault. I let them rest for about 7 months, and could tell a difference. They settled down, and the “taste” was more defined. I’ve let rye age, and also has done the same for me. Hope that helps! They are a fantastic stick for sure. You won’t regret it"

shrooms,fetgoz1,t1_fetg20a,1579375240.0,I shook about a week and a half ago. There’s not a lot of loose grains. It’s just not thick like the bottom. If that makes sense.
shrooms,fetb6ix,t3_eqkhbu,1579373549.0,"Hello all! Jar is 3 weeks old. I shook the jar at about 30%, and it’s stalled out around 60-70%. The jar looks pretty much the same around all sides. The bottom is thick with mycelium. Should I put into monotub, or wait it out?"
