I have a lot of friends in my local kink community. I dont participate, but I fully support it. (I am kinky, I just prefer privacy)
 
I have an ex who was new to the whole thing and wanted to get into it, but he was pretty warped one of those ""I identify with the joker"" douchbags. He became abusive and our relationship ended with a restraining order. He then tried to thrust himself into our local kink community, and ended up physically hurting more than one girl before he was quite literally run out of the city.
 
He couldn't even be an Uber driver because too many people recognized him.

Within a month she was dead. She struggled with mental health problems and she had an episode when she was alone, and took her own life. Which she NEVER would have done in sound mind.

1. They stayed white when smoking a joint or spliff
 2. There were a lot of papers per pack.
 3. There was a ""warning paper"" as we liked to call it. 
 
Most packs of rolling papers have a stiff piece of paper or cardboard at the very end to keep the papers stiff. Burglar papers always had a few papers behind that piece, so you knew you had to get more papers instead of just pulling your last paper out without much warning."
