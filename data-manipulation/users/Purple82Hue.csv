It addresses permission of service and support animals in real estate situations and common use areas, etc. The case by case stuff is for denial of an RA submitted by a current potential tenant due to things such and undue hardship, seriously deviating the core program, health and safety of others regarding the tenant’s animal."

Per your story, he threatened to kill or seriously harm you and certainly displayed an intention to do so. Follow up on the report, ensure all this information is included and ask what the police intend to do next. If you’re told to piss off, you could contact the department’s internal affairs and explain the situation."

NoStupidQuestions,ffv0xj2,t3_evddy9,1580253156.0,I would think this indicates a need for a therapist (different than a psychiatrist). Discuss issues (perhaps if you don’t see anything as an issue just start off with the things you speak about whenever the statement about seeing a professional comes up) and commit to the recommended treatment plan (i.e. 1 visit per week for 6 weeks).

NoStupidQuestions,ff72gd4,t3_es0pbg,1579639782.0,US (Seattle) has one confirmed case but freaking out will only reduce your body’s ability to fight it off. Be smart - don’t go getting into contact with other people’s secretions and wash your hands properly and often. Try not to touch your face during the day and keep a bottle of hand sanitizer for times you can’t go wash up like maybe after hand shakes and after pumping gas.

legaladvice,fep4mqp,t1_fep3h5t,1579312028.0,"One other thought since this LL seems like he may not respect his tenants privacy, it would be in your best interest to invest in a Ring doorbell and or a doggy camera. This way if he is entering the unit at other times you will know and you have a reasonable excuse for having a camera recording your property."
legaladvice,fep1v6m,t3_eq9b8u,1579310269.0,"OP, this sounds like an invasion of your privacy. He LL has done due diligence in providing notice prior to entering and the unit condition inspection is within the law but specifically entering with the intent to conduct an unlawful search of your possessions is not within the LL’s rights. This gets tricky to defend though because I’m sure your lease, as do most, forbid conducting or participating in illegal activities while on the premises. Ofcourse this is to protect a LL so he or she has a legal reason to evict a tenant who is, let’s say cooking meth or dealing weed in his apt.  Obviously, you, the law abiding neighbor, would not want this occurring, increasing the dangers you are exposed to due to your unwittingly close proximity to the criminal activities. Therefore, if the LL simply left the stated reason as for unit condition inspection he would have saved a lot of trouble. Now it would seem to me the LL has placed himself at a liability for an invasion of privacy claim. If the LL looks through personal property, he is not allowing you peaceful enjoyment of your rented unit. I advise you to take the notice to a lawyer and ask for some legal, municipality-specific guidance in how to approach the issue with your LL. In the mean time Ofcourse the generalized asshole answer could apply - if you’re not doing anything illegal, you have nothing to worry about. The common sense counter-advice is if you are in possession of illegal items/substances you should lock them up, such as in a portable safe (IE not by locking the items inside a closet or bathroom). You may want to do a little more CYA by taking a basic inventory of valuables, take a picture (or even better video) of how you leave the unit each day you head out for work for use as evidence, such as if the bed is made when you leave and disturbed when you return.)"
