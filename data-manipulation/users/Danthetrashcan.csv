NewSkaters,ffnwse1,t1_ffnht19,1580071766.0,really? i feel like i always am hurting my knees. i’m also 6’2 and 200
depression,fdrtbah,t1_fdqr39c,1578689467.0,"same. my uncle died of cancer and it looked like a horrible way to go. we all sat there with him hoping he’d make it somehow, but he didn’t. it took 4 years, and he was already depressed, but he fought it for us so we could be with him longer. i’d rather have my death be in my hands. i don’t want to sit on a hospital bed and watch as everyone balls their eyes out around me. this post is low key offensive as hell to me. idk OP, but he seems to have no idea the pain cancer causes to you and loved ones"
maybemaybemaybe,fdpv4z0,t1_fdohszp,1578641760.0,"hey man, i’m only 18 and most of my earned money is disposable cause i live with my mom so i don’t really understand your problems, but i go to planet fitness 3 days a week for 10 dollars a month. it’s really cheap. skateboarding is much more expensive on the contrary. boards and gear is one thing, but injuries are also another. depending on where you live, you could seriously end up in financial trouble if you were to break your elbow or something else like i did. i needed surgery and i’m really fucking lucky, i have good insurance, so i only had to pay a 1,000 dollar deductible, but the surgery itself was something like 20k, or so my mom said, i was 17 at the time so not my concern. i also lost a lot of time, the recovery was 4 months, and my arm does not function the same anymore. 

The gym is amazing. Just saying. It’s a chore but it’s worth it in the long run and really helped with my self esteem. Skating did that too, it was a skill to work on and a passion of mine. So i’m not saying not to skate, it could be what you need, but i’d definitely look into the gym"

depression,fd12vz5,t1_fcwr4y9,1578127015.0,nah man. of course i care. thank you
depression,fcwk3tu,t1_fcwjisb,1578027801.0,"i’m pretty aware of the numbers i’ve always been. it’s cool i guess but i mean it’s not really something that keeps me going. i definitely am thankful for being given a life, but my depression is not voluntary. i definitely would consider myself a nihilist, i’m not necessarily worried. like i said i’m more in a neutral depressed state."
depression,fcwj4vs,t1_fcwibg6,1578027020.0,thanks
depression,fcvzsv3,t1_fcvt8cf,1578013852.0,Thanks for reading. Good luck with whatever you’re dealing with as well
depression,fcvzqwx,t1_fcvp2oa,1578013816.0,"I definitely should volunteer somewhere. I mostly only do work for money. I always saw volunteering as a way to feel better about yourself, and for some reason I saw that as a bad thing? I guess feeling better about yourself isn’t bad lol"
depression,fcvybw5,t1_fcvxcf6,1578012886.0,"Suicidal thoughts, yes. It is often my first solution that comes to my head whenever I have a problem. Actions or tendencies? Not yet. Fantasies? Sometimes I like the idea of someone finding my body, but only in the heat of the moment, eventually I calm down. Suicide isn’t really something I plan on doing but I see it as a possibility in my future if that makes sense. I definitely don’t have it as bad as most people on this subreddit when it comes to suicide"

BoJackHorseman,fc1cf1t,t3_efg9tb,1577314589.0,"this is actually why i don’t like christmas personally. it doesn’t make you a bad person if you don’t have a family yet the holiday makes those of us who don’t have one to spend it with feel like shit for no reason. 

everyone reading this, you don’t need a family. all you need is you. merry christmas. it’ll be okay, we’ll get through this shit"
