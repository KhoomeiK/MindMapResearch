One lives five hours away and i haven’t seen her in years, one has a job during m-f from like 7-5 and sees a boy every weekends that she doesn’t even want anything with, and my best friend has a boyfriend of like 4 years now so she sees him a lot. I wish I had more friends but everyone is fake and annoying :///"
depression,fe8w1tg,t3_eo1usb,1578931645.0,"Girl, i’m the same exact way. I’ll be 22 in July, i’m doing school but all online and my parents own their own business so I can work there but I’ve been doing that since high school and every time I’m there i’m so used to everything that my mind is constantly running about everything and I just get more depressed. I wanted to move but my boyfriends mom is making him do classes so he has to stay and I can’t get myself to go alone. I don’t wanna get a job around here because i’ve looked and can’t find anything, and I don’t want just a normal job like at a store or restaurant because my anxiety is so bad and especially when seeing people I know. I was gonna work at this one children’s hospital as a adolescent girls care taker but I got scared and backed out, because I don’t know if I even wanna do that anymore. I feel like i’m failing at everything and my parents are so upset with me. I live at home so they know everything. I even went to my mom crying the other day and told her how I was sad all the time and she just doesn’t understand. It’s upsetting. My boyfriend says he understands but he doesn’t and he doesn’t understand sometimes I just need him to be there for me and hold me, not constantly try to make me talk to him. I just feel like no one understands and i’m going through this alone and everyone not understanding and forcing me to do stuff I don’t want to is only making it worse. I’m so unhappy and I don’t know what to do anymore."

Life fucking sucks at times, but after the storm there is always a rainbow. I have pushed myself through so much and have looked back and been so grateful that I did that. The beginning of 2019 I was depressed, in a hole, and so lonely, the end of 2019 I am happy to be here, I have goals and dreams I am going to achieve in 2020, and I have a boyfriend and friends who are so true and real. We are all here for you, your family or your friends or us here on reddit. We will always be here for you."

Change it up, instead of going on walks try another activity like hiking, yoga, or try meditation. I’m new to meditation but after the first few times you learn to just have peace for a period of time and it helps. You have all of us here, you have me. New year, new decade, new you, let’s fucking get it and make 2020 our bitch. This is the year to change, this is the year for YOU!"
