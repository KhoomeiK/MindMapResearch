Oh and the mask flipping out was cool too"

Honestly, I thought it was great. Find a flavor you enjoy and stick to it. You don't need someone else's formula."

gaming,fdcp9ep,t1_fdcklpq,1578280594.0,"My point is that it's almost the same thing.    Like if I were to turn this into a more easily recognizable Boomer comic, I could say people used to be happy playing outside, now they get angry when their game doesn't load fast enough. This comic is like the next step, where you now reminisce about playing video games together in one room, and now it's poking fun at people who play on expensive set ups and aren't happy.


I know, it's technically not Boomer generation material, but it's kind of like the next generation being guilty of the same exact thing. I understand the down votes since this is an unpopular opinion, but can anyone explain to me why I'm wrong?"
gaming,fdc62sl,t3_ekhlv7,1578267824.0,"I'm a little puzzled here. Everyone is agreeing, but this is almost exactly identical to a Boomer humor comic strip. Like, this could have easily been playing outside in the ""good old days"" vs kids now playing on phones and TVs.

I can get why some may find it funny, but it's a little ironic. Not knocking the comic or anything, just want to make that clear."

aww,fcsry34,t1_fcsrgr0,1577923587.0,"Cat scratches too. But I think it may have more to do with the fact that cats clean themselves frequently. Can't say I know for sure. And, as others have pointed out, most other commonly kept house pets are considered to be clean too."

aww,fcspya9,t1_fcsp7sd,1577922154.0,"Good question, I don't want to mislead you, but I believe it's a matter of having saliva on your person while praying. So, if a dog licked your pant leg for whatever reason, your clothing is considered impure, and you can't pray in it. You would have to change first. If it licked your skin, hand or foot, you'd need to wash the area thoroughly (some may say to perform ablution again, a small cleaning ritual for Muslims)."
aww,fcsnvtx,t1_fcsn47w,1577920686.0,Oh thanks for the clarification! I made a mistake.

aww,fcskd3z,t1_fcsdj4g,1577918322.0,"Cats are kind of the only house pets who's saliva isn't considered impure, meaning you can pray without washing up if you were licked by one. That doesn't mean you can't have a dog, but it's just a little more convenient having a cat.
Edit: so it seems dogs happen to be one of some animals with saliva that is considered impure. So rabbits, hamsters, fish, etc. are also okay. Sorry for my mistake!"
