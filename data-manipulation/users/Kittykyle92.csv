aww,ffzh8wn,t1_ffzh51n,1580379020.0,Or like a standard adoption or rehoming amount of money? It's worth asking if they really want to keep the cat. She coulda bought the cat during a bad time and is now only keeping it because she feels responsible for it. If she's willing to let people house it for months at only 2 I doubt she has that deep a connection with the cat.
aww,ffzgn07,t1_ffyscn8,1580378118.0,Why don't you offer to buy the cat from her? Tell her you've really bonded with the cat.

I had my tongue start to swell up super huge and I was first in line at the ER cause of that.

Unlike most cases breathing issues have 2-3 mins before they can go from bad to deadly."

Once I had a reliable partner I was able to rely on them protecting me and not just leaving me to die or jump in to a fight by themselves. 

I climbed out and have been out of bronze and am currently in high gold. But I still understand the struggle of playing healer without a reliable team. Healers aren't solo players, we literally rely on the team working together."
Overwatch,ffd0onh,t3_esyojj,1579811111.0,It's incredibly hard to get out of bronze solo queuing. Almost every time I feel down that way I either had to find someone to play with to be my not shitty dps/ shield or stop at 2 losses to slowly climb out.

Honestly it was him who opened my eyes to alot of things. Like how Batman only has male sidekicks directly under him, any female Robin's or batgirls always get, raped, pregnant or injured so bad they can't fight crime in his comics. Only ones that do make it are standalone series like Batwoman. He brought that to my attention because I said how much I love Carrie Kelly and wished we had more female sidekicks."

But we all know the villains and themes for Korra were dark and entertaining. Some boys only like strong female characters when they're not the ones in charge. 

Example: Black widow was pretty loved as a sexy spy working for shield, Captain Marvel a heavy hitter like Thor and Hulk? Working alone. Not so much love."
TheLastAirbender,ff42xic,t1_ff3jkxr,1579554384.0,"It all comes down to them not liking Korra for being an emotional teenage girl who got angry and aggressive. She isn't as calm and ladylike like Katara, and isn't just a funny kid like Toph. So they don't like her."

I don't stream or pretend to be outdoorsy. I don't post pictures of myself posing with things. I take pictures of my cat and clouds and nice flowers. Just because I stream doesn't mean my streaming revolves around some fake feminine personality.

You're so obsessed with people living life differently than you. Some people like the cold and nature but suffer from being outdoors to long but would benefit from fresh air. Don't go hating on people who live differently than you just cause they're not able to hike and go outdoors as often as other people.

We see this with the family home not really having anything of Jesse's and everything of the other kid. Fuck even the youngest kid is smoking from the stress of living up to their parents expectations.

Jesse is responsible for his actions as an adult. No one is saying differently, but the parents fucked him up as a kid and so for that FUCK THE PARENTS."
breakingbad,fcuz5cj,t1_fcuxxjj,1577991413.0,"What? I'm just explaining that if Jesse didn't have such mean parents who only cared about academic achievements he would have probably had a better life. If his parents supported his art and less his intelligence they could have dramatically changed his life for the better.

How parents raise their children truly does affect how they're going to end up in life. A life of neglect and shame makes people look for ways to escape reality.

Edit: also Jesse is smart, just not book smart. He needs hands on experience like with how he learned to make meth in the end."

That didn't fit into his parents demands for him so he never lived up to be what his parents wanted him to be, like his brother. His younger brother obviously doesn't like living how he has to live with the pressure his parents are holding him to, that's why he hid weed in his room and said Jesse was the favorite kid. 

If the parents were more supportive people in their children's lives instead of forcing them to be what they want, then maybe they wouldn't have been left to drugs to ease their overbearing stress."
