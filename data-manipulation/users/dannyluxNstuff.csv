UpliftingNews,ffi696l,t1_ffi5luj,1579966198.0,Yea. I mean there's no way you can get them late fees. The only downside for them would be if they use Libby also or check out a ton of books from their library. There's really nothing to lose for them.
UpliftingNews,ffi4u6k,t1_ffi4kf5,1579965110.0,"This is true the latest books are harder to get. What I do is have different people's library card numbers from different states and counties. This way I can check like 20 different libraries till I find the book I want.

Edit: also to me 14 days is enough time to crank out a book."
UpliftingNews,ffi38gb,t1_ffhxy18,1579963787.0,Free internet access to get ebook from the library. I go to the library occasionally to get books from my son but im on Libby constantly getting ebooks and audiobooks from my library.

boardgames,ffh5ri8,t3_etkse1,1579923875.0,Low amount of player interaction but insteresting dynamic of having to band together to fight the monsters or not. I really like the game. We have only played the first 3 scenerarios in the book so we have only scratched the surface of it but my whole group really enjoyed it.

boardgames,ffgno87,t1_ffft6ko,1579910482.0,"My wife's favorite game and because of that probably my most played game since I got it (and I have many that I own and love). We like to play with the Kickstarter legendary cards. Adding pearlbrook has been fun for a little bit of push your luck and some new wrinkles. The adornments are really what make Pearlbrook. I'm pretty constantly near or over 100 points now so I'm gonna wait for the next expansions to really play it more often. Great artwork,.components, theme, game play. 9 out of 10"

boardgames,ffctvyk,t3_eswbt0,1579807164.0,I watch rhado more for the playthroughs and how he takes you through the decisions he's making for a little strategy. I could care less if he likes the game or not. I very seldomly watch his final thoughts video and I do appreciate that he seperates them so if I don't want his opinion I can skip it.

LifeProTips,ffc23qs,t1_ffba3bg,1579789609.0,Don't feel bad. One year I had to train for a new job for 3 months in another state (coming home on weekends) and I had to file a state tax return for that state. Especially sucked because my state doesn't have income tax. Really annoying. I also won a hand pay at a casino while I was in training and totally forgot to pay taxes on that.
LifeProTips,ffc1t1p,t1_ff9tnuc,1579789387.0,I live in Florida duh
exredpill,ffa8cv2,t1_ffa3og3,1579729866.0,Depends. Are men shallow because they want to date an attractive woman? I really don't see much wrong with a woman wanting someone successful. It's not just about wanting gifts or nice things. It can be about security and not worrying about money. Sure there are certainly gold diggers or women who use their looks to live a certain lifestyle. But I think most people people just want love and to be secure.

boardgames,ff87y8o,t3_es6no0,1579668593.0,I didn't even know this existed.
boardgames,ff79oat,t3_erx68g,1579643996.0,Does anyone know how Oath will play at different player counts. Specifically if it's playable at 2p without a shadow team
exredpill,ff77q9i,t1_ff76o28,1579642767.0,I was broke most of my life and didn't start making money till after I met my wife so I can only speak from my experience but the kind of women interested only in money are shallow and not worth my time.

boardgames,ff698be,t1_ff68tvs,1579622101.0,I was thinking more unofficial ones I could buy online or print at Kinko's on nice card stock but I'm guessing the next reprint or expansion will have them updated.
boardgames,ff68ez6,t3_eruuyc,1579621575.0,I wonder if anyone is made updated civilization cards for the new rebalancing
boardgames,ff4ol6n,t1_ff4e44o,1579568676.0,Camel up is a great party game that's not social deduction or hidden role. Really fun at parties with non gamers. Remember it's not a game about camel races. It's a game about betting on camel races.
boardgames,ff4ob9g,t1_ff46px5,1579568482.0,I thought it fit really well. Pretty easy to reach in and pull out each layer if you use the folios and the modul boards to layer each section. I was actually really impressed by the whole design of it.
boardgames,ff4o6d5,t3_eri2tq,1579568386.0,"I went all in and then I got everything in to the big box. Then I taped the guide of how everything goes back in to box to inside lid of the big box. Took the cardboard goods and the non-deluxe player boards, threw them in the above and below box and threw that in the garage."
boardgames,ff4n6aa,t3_ergwko,1579567678.0,Mine came. I punched everything out and got everything in the big box but haven't played yet. I'm a huge Argent fan although it doesn't hit the table very much. I love the art and the deluxe components and the abilities. Can't wait to play this one. Thanks for your review.

news,ff248t5,t1_ff1mnqz,1579493375.0,Not to mention that start asking foreign looking people for their proof of citizenship is another constitutional nightmare that effects our liberty.
boardgames,feykeh9,t1_fewip21,1579446712.0,"I don't disagree that it wasn't there best work but as a company I do appreciate a lot of things they do really well. Like making all promo cards available on their website and btw making excellent games. Also with so many horrible poorly run kickstarters to nominate them as one of the worst over what I'll call pretty trivial misteps, one of which they are fixing at what I'm sure is a huge cost to them seems pretty petty."
boardgames,fewhjl0,t1_fesbqhj,1579410687.0,"I like my deluxe reavers ks edition. The game trays are a little thin but still nice and do the trick and I believe they are sending new ones anyway which seems totally uncessarry. As for the cards, a linen finish would have been preferred but I'm guessing then went over budget. With a plethora of ks games that never deliver or with owners who are stealing game ideas and worse, to put Greyfox up there as terrible is absurd. They are a more than standup company."

boardgames,fen0cej,t1_femzwi4,1579274117.0,It really depends on what forest cards are out but yea obviously you want greens in season 1 so you can activate 3 full times. Don't be afraid do discard your hand for resources. Greens are typically low points but provide resources so you want to get them down early and out of City late.
boardgames,femx16f,t1_femw1uz,1579271829.0,"Yea the one I could find was one I posted on a bgg forum that I was super proud of breaking 100. This is with legendary cards as evidenced by 17 cards in city. Sorry couldn't rotate pic for whatever reason but luckily for the pic I pulled all my special and basic events down. 

Best game of everdell https://imgur.com/gallery/DSd0Zsy

Not sure why my pearlbrook games are lower. Maybe I'm not as practiced with it since I've played Everdell without pearlbrook so much and only played pearlbrook like 8 times?"
boardgames,femppl8,t1_fem6gt7,1579265918.0,No I can break 100 without legendary or expanaions. My pearlbrook scores are usually more like 75-85 for whatever reason. My highest was 104 but that was with legendary.

boardgames,felcpbb,t1_felcfw3,1579219085.0,I take no credit. Found it on the bgg forums but happy to spread around. I think my favorite way to play Everdell is with the legendary cards and pearlbrook
boardgames,fel80nh,t1_fel6dks,1579216050.0,"Yea I remember thinking how dumb cards like the crane, or the dungeon were when I first started to play. Now I realize the power of cards that remove carda from your city allowing you get more resources and replace with higher scoring cards. I backed all the new KS expansions but they really need to add more new critters and constructions."
boardgames,fel1e9b,t1_fekytqe,1579211965.0,I don't use the variant when playing with pearlbrook
boardgames,fekug63,t3_epjp6x,1579207834.0,"I love both these games but Everdell is more reactive in that you make the best of the cards available in your hand, in the meadow, and resources spaces available and you can engine build a bit with green production and government cards. Where Viticulture the only thing you might react to is summer and winter cards. Everdell is much more thinky. And as someone else said the skill cap moves up quickly. My first game of Everdell I scored like 40 points. Now I'm almost always around 100 or more."
boardgames,fekr464,t3_epn59a,1579205874.0,In a 2 player game I do a variant where we have a 9th meadow card that I put where the 4th forest card would be in a 4 player game.  Everytime a card is taken from the meadow I put a new 9th meadow card out on top of that one. This basically allows us to turn the deck a little faster and also adds a strategy of taking something from the standard meadow to quickly hide the card underneath it. Or taking something from the 9th card pile to later get the one the underneath. In a 3-4 player game I feel like you can cycle through the cards faster.

Not saying they shouldn't get a few lucky shots off just from the sheer volume of blasters but I would expect they would be handled easily by a more powerful force. If they were fighting villagers or low level resistance grunts I expect they do quite well seeing as they nearly conquered the galaxy.

Where Viticulture the only thing you might react to is summer and winter cards. Everdell is much more thinky. And as someone else said the skill cap moves up quickly. My first game of Everdell I scored like 40 points. Now I'm almost always around 100 or more."
boardgames,fekr464,t3_epn59a,1579205874.0,In a 2 player game I do a variant where we have a 9th meadow card that I put where the 4th forest card would be in a 4 player game.  Everytime a card is taken from the meadow I put a new 9th meadow card out on top of that one. This basically allows us to turn the deck a little faster and also adds a strategy of taking something from the standard meadow to quickly hide the card underneath it. Or taking something from the 9th card pile to later get the one the underneath. In a 3-4 player game I feel like you can cycle through the cards faster.
