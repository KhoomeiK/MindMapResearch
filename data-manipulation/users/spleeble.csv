I've had mixed experiences with having shops work on fixed gear bikes. As a matter of fact the only time I've had a cog blow out hub threads like yours did it was after a shop installed it. It was a shop that I trust in general and I didn't know better at the time, but nevertheless it turned out that fixed hubs were not part of their expertise. 

When I install a cog/lockring myself I find that each one needs more torque than I can really apply on the stand, and I need to have the wheel on the floor and lean my weight on the tool to get it tight. Not quite spitting and straining tight but about as much force as I can comfortably apply.

In short you need to make sure both the cog and lock ring are tight enough when they are installed. Grease does help. Very light on the threads, none on the surface between the cog and lock ring.
