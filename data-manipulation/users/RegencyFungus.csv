AskReddit,fd5olt0,t3_ejubhh,1578179725.0,"I always wanted to live in Boston. I thought I would love the architecture and go on adventures and learn lots. However, the city wasn't what I thought it would be. The T is a mess and is literally on fire pretty often. People there are terrible drivers. Most people aren't that nice, and if you weren't born and raised there, it's hard to make friends. Additionally, it's becoming very, very gentrified. The cost to live there is insane, even in surrounding towns. So, we left. I'm still going to visit annually, since my husband's family is there, but I wasn't happy in Boston."

My husband is more open with his emotions than me and I love him for it. We balance each other well. You deserve someone who cares about you and respects that you also have feelings."
