Looks like it's the subreddits policy to ban anyone who has posted in a specific set of subs they believe are responsible for brigading. Kind of ironic for a sub about justice to be banning people with zero due process.

Also ironic to ban a bunch of people without evidence that they were involved in any sort of brigading... giving them a legitimate motive to brigade. 

Reddit mod logic!"

So the logic is, we should just draft the best player with the highest draft stock and most trade potential so we can get a proven defensive secondary player. It seeks to minimizes the risk and maximize the value of the pick"
