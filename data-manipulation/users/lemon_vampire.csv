And also there are victims in plant ag. As a species our domestics are not nearly as much as a victim as wildlife living near a crop monoculture.

I agree people should be educated. Farms are like fingerprints, no 2 are alike. There are some incredible farms out there that raise animals ethically and help the enviornment at the same time.

It can take up to 3 days until their lungs and heart finally are paralyzed enough for the mouse to finally suffocate and die.  You wanna think about how long 3 days is for an animal who's life expectancy is 2 years?  I'd rather take a captive bolt to the head any day.

&#x200B;

Herein lies the problem.

The population of farmers has dramatically decreased over the last century.  I had heard in the united states in the 1920s something like 40% of people were farmers.  Now its's something like 2%.  Everyone else has moved to the city to do dead end, meaningless bureaucratic office jobs.  Probably because government regulations have made it increasingly difficult to survive off of a small or medium scale farm.  Subsidies only go to the biggest, most mechanized farms.

&#x200B;

But instead of looking to find a way to encourage smaller, more sustainable farms, people just attack the farmers themselves.  Urban society actually looks down on farmers, despite the fact they rely on farmers more than any other occupation (other than maybe mechanics or construction workers).   It is not uncommon for a vegan to say they hate all farmers.  

&#x200B;

Vegans would have far less of a leg to stand on to convert others to their religion if there were more farmers competing with each other, each one more ethical and transparent than the next.

This is not a documentary on Netflix. I know vegans want animal agriculture to disappear but then there is no way to grow their crops without absolutely obliterating the environment.

Plant crops absolutely need animals in order to be sustainably produced. You would literally be shooting yourself in the head if you got rid of animal agriculture. 

Do you have any idea where your food comes from? I did my homework, I know about factory farms, I know about cafos  but I also know about the horrors that come with plant agriculture. I tried veganism. It didn't work, and then with critical thinking I realized that veganism doesn't work on any of its pillars of Ethics, health or environmentalism.

I eat pasture-raised animals. Believe it or not it's actually not hard to find if you're willing to do your homework. It's not cheap, but every time I support it I'm telling the economy that this is a profitable Avenue to go down. Not only is raising animals on rotating pasture sustainable, it actually helped sequester carbon, meaning it makes a positive mark on the environment. Even more amazingly, people who practice pasture rotation with more than one type of animal on said pasture have reported that they are more efficient than conventional Farms. Which means in the future, potentially an ethically raised animal can be cheaper than a conventionally raised animal.

 Times are changing, for the better for animals, people, and the environment. But I just don't see veganism as a worldwide solution to all of our Modern Problems.

Not every meat eater is some McDonald's eating thoughtless murderer like Peta has taught you to believe. Some of us actually care about animals and put a lot of time and effort into learning about animal husbandry."
tippytaps,fdkhnh7,t1_fdkcghv,1578504065.0,"By the very definition of veganism from the vegan Society a vegan is not a vegan. If they go and buy produce from the supermarket they rely on the labor of millions of bees and the destruction of the environment via fertilizers and pesticides and tillage. If you want to do a body count then I would say veganism is far worse than someone who sources there animal products.  Look up fish die offs. All those animals died for crop production. And before you say its to feed animals, im against using subsidized crops to feed animals that can live just as well if not better on pasture. 

I've seen plenty of livestock animals spend their entire lives Outdoors living live Bar Superior then their wild counterparts. If I were a ruminant herbivore I would prefer to live in the Captivity of a human then risk being eaten ass first by a predator.

Stop being so afraid of death , it happens to everyone , even you. And by the way, I don't know if you realize this, but you're also being exploited.

If you really cared about animals you do understand that animal rights calls for the prioritization of animal abolition as opposed to improving the quality of an animal's life.

Animal welfare>>>animal rights"
tippytaps,fdkc134,t1_fdkbh05,1578500688.0,"Leave them alone? From what? Humans?  Other animals?  They live with us even if we wanted to we cant leave them alone. Even vegans rely on animals for their fat,flesh, and byproducts. Vaccinations are made with eggs and bovine serum, the device you are typing to me on is made with animal parts.

These are our fellow lifeforms, and we all depend on one another whether you like it or not.

Just because i eat animal products does not mean i  approve of conventional agricultural practices that have been exasperated by government subsidies on fossil fuels and cash crops."
tippytaps,fdiqcz5,t1_fdhqwo1,1578448677.0,"Im pro animal welfare, anti animal rights.

I think animals should be treated with respect as living, feeling creatures who need space, stimulation, and to be treated with respect.  I don’t think animals should have “rights” the same way humans have rights. Like what right? The right to vote? To get a job?  Rights are earned. Welfare is given.   Someone can say they care about animal rights but keep a beta fish in a .25gal cup.  You can claim to love animals but make your cat sick feeding it a vegan diet.  Animal welfare is still living and co-existing with animals, but understanding that they are individuals with individual lives and individual needs based on the context of its own life.  A wild animal can’t live in captivity, a captive animal can’t live in the wild."

The vast majority goods  and raw materials sold in cities are outsourced from rural areas  There are a lot of jobs because there is a lot of consumption and refining of raw materials, but not a lot of actual production.

I don't know about you, but I have been to many different cities all over the world, every single one of them is dirtier, has lower air quality, and is more polluted than any rural area I have ever been to, regardless of the nation.

And even with an individuals mark being half that of a person living in a rural area (which really ultimately just boils down to the individual lifestyle, a person in a rural area could easily have a lifestyle that is more environmentally efficient than someone in a city), having 10,000x+ the population of any sparsely populated area means that area as a whole is 10,000x + worse for the environment.

Like maybe there’s some weird study that makes the claim an individual in a city is less likely to drive, but if you use your eyes you will notice there are like 100000 times more cars in cities. They are like giant cancerous tumors on the Earth.  Not to mention since city folk don’t produce anything, they increase demand for gigantic mega farms and global imports.

Just from existing, the buildings of a city kill hundreds if not thousands of migrating birds a day.   Cities are awful."

It’s okay that the cow isn’t a person, a cow shouldn’t be abused or disrespected just like any living, feeling organism. But I am an animal welfare advocate, not an animal rights activist.
