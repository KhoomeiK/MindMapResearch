I've tagged them in some videos and infographics that the Float spa uploads, but they dont seem interested. Stuck in their ways, but at least I'm trying to open their eyes! It's up to them whether or not they want to see!"
keto,fftifs6,t3_ev4pwg,1580221396.0,"She may need to up the calories if shes doing some hardcore workouts. I was hovering at 1000 cal over the Holidays, did not cheat at all, my period was extremely erratic, so New Years I upped to 1300 cal. Last period was on point and my weight had gone down again. 

Also, if shes building muscle, the inflammation from the micro tears in the building process will hold water. Watch the sodium intake, it holds water as well. As a female, she needs to be aware of her cycles (I recommend tracking with 'Clue') and learn when her body naturally wants to store water, and weight...its different for all, sometimes they drop weight before, sometimes after, and sometimes during the period.

Give it time and trust the process!  If shes eating under her caloric maintenanc for her height, age, etc, she should be golden-just takes time!"

I got my Dad and Aunt a gift card there for Christmas and they both were like, ""what's that? You just float...on water...nothing else?"" I feel like they wont understand the point even if they end up redeeming the gift card."
intermittentfasting,fftgcyi,t3_ev5u96,1580219766.0,"Purists will say that anything with calories will break a fast.

Dirty fasters will say anything under 50 cal is fine.

Bottom line...fasting is not consuming anything but water, but you'll always have those that drink coffee, herbal teas...you do you the best you can."

I enjoy all compliments I get-when I was 275#, I definitely had some jealousy towards anyone who worked to lose weight, so I understand where the HAES hate comes from, but now that I'm on this side, I understand why people share their progress."

keto,ffnj4dd,t3_eubaa3,1580066600.0,"In theory, yes. However, it is advised that you spend your carbs on veggies, nuts, seeds, avocados, etc.

The idea is to become accustomed to viewing food as fuel, not comfort/rewards/mouth pleasure.

But...yes...technically...you can spend your 20g daily allowance however you want"

Then I weighed myself at 6am this morning: 198.8

That's why it is advised to do it 1x week, 1x month if you can. I like to watch the fluctuations, personally, so I do it daily. 

I just happened to wake up at 3am thinking it was 6am (weird dreams, let me tell you), so I weighed myself. Today was an anomaly."
