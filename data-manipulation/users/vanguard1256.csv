It’s pretty much a complete build minus watcher’s eye and some other minor upgrades. You don’t need to be able freeze bosses and metas, you can just kite their attacks. I use acro/phase acro with the blind from the pandemonius and the elusive buff from mistwalker/withering step as defensive layers."
PathOfExileBuilds,ff8tgpq,t3_esamsk,1579695464.0,Your weapon is real trash for coc. Honestly you shouldn’t have switched without at least one cospri. You don’t need gifts from above. Just get another rare ring. Use the -3 mana to channeled skills instead of crafting mana. That doesn’t help you at all. Craft some resists too. It seems like you know what you need to fix
pathofexile,ff7dy9f,t3_erw7z1,1579647334.0,People have been doing actual scams this way though. I had an eye of the samurai listed at 1.5 ex and someone changed it to 120 chaos and tried to act like he didn’t do it on purpose.

Acro/phase acro doesn’t really force you to build only evasion, as lots of builds still use hybrid armors because they have powerful unique options (like loreweave or belly of the beast) 

I think you also missed the block mechanic as a defensive layer as well as blind (from blood and sand or the pandemonius as examples)

There are also ascendancies that provide defensive layers such as the assassin’s mistwalker node buffing elusive, which I think is a fairly recent addition."
PathOfExileBuilds,ff47xyb,t1_ff44ocn,1579557498.0,"No. Mistwalker is a flat 20% attack speed while you are elusive at any %. You need only to trigger the elusive, which is why people treat it as 100% uptime."
PathOfExileBuilds,ff3w3ms,t3_erg7xg,1579550127.0,Coc ice nova can kill t16 metas just fine. Is ball lightning that much lower damage? Or are you looking to kill things in less than 5 seconds?
PathOfExileBuilds,ff3ct62,t1_fd47lup,1579538593.0,"The breakpoints are 6.06 for no cdr, 7.57 for 14% cdr, and if you want to try to go for the maximum dps with dual cospri, it’s 15.14. But you ideally want to be slightly under the breakpoint. Don’t forget to factor in mistwalker, and if you try to go for 15.14 breakpoint you have to get close to 15 aps or you’ll screw up your chest coc timing."
PathOfExileBuilds,ff3c5ox,t1_ff3ab4k,1579538250.0,"Take it from someone who tried to league start a coc ice nova build. You really want a 10 ex budget to get things going, 15 if you want dual cospri. It was a real struggle trying to play this on a tight budget. I did manage to get through mapping with rare foils, a corrupted 6L, rare rings, and no cdr belt/boots but it was not a smooth ride. Cdr belt will cost you about 1-2ex, boots will be 3-4 ex. You only need one or the other at 14%+ cdr, but using boots will allow you to use Stygian vise for belt slot. You can use starkonja’s for helm slot, and incursion gloves are pretty cheap. 

Going for the mark of the shaper+elder ring could run you 3-5 ex easily, and pandemonius runs you about 5 ex. These are the things I upgraded later when I picked up enough currency for them."
PathOfExileBuilds,ff3akad,t1_ff35kn0,1579537448.0,Agreed. At level 88 you should just be short some life nodes or maybe you don’t have all your power charge nodes or jewel sockets yet.

PathOfExileBuilds,fdpojwm,t1_fdp09ya,1578634722.0,"Yes, that’s right. Currently your second attack is landing before the cd goes off, so your third attack is what triggers the nova. Then the cd starts again from your third strike. It ends up being somewhere between 25 and 50 percent dps loss. Also make sure you’re factoring in mistwalker.

PathOfExileBuilds,fdn9y30,t1_fdn9ba2,1578581156.0,"Cast on crit operates on an aps breakpoint system where more is not necessarily better. Cospri’s can cast on a 150 (really 165 due to server ticks) ms cd, which translates to 6.06 aps without cdr. Same for your chest. With 14% cdr or more, the number becomes 7.57. Since cyclone alternates weapons, you either want to be just under 6.06 or 7.57 aps to hit your chest ice novas on every cd. To be truly optimal, you want to hit basically exactly 12 or 15 aps. This will hit each cospri on cooldown while maintaining the sync for the main coc ice nova in your chest. Anything deviating off this is likely to punish your dps by a lot. I think I computed it to be somewhere around a 30% loss. I know you said damage was fine, but it’s definitely something to keep in mind."
PathOfExileBuilds,fdn4pw6,t3_em909q,1578577216.0,"You also may need to change your play style. You can’t just sit there and cyclone in front of bosses.

It’s one of the benefits cyclone brings, but you have to make use of it. I also feel like I should point out your attack speed might be too high. Are you at 12 aps on cyclone with mistwalker up?"

Shield looks like a weird choice, but I assume you have limited options in ssf.

Edit: Took a look at your passive tree. Your pathing omits quite a few life nodes. I would go for the life+chaos resist nodes since chaos damage is pretty prevalent in this league. It's a little out of the way, but it's better than melding imo. There are also 3 life nodes on the left of where you've gone that you could pick up as well.

When I got back he walked up to me and jammed his mouth on my finger and just started hardcore sucking on it.

I still have a lot of upgrades and tweaks to do, but I can clear everything up to sirus easily enough. I haven’t had enough experience with the sirus fight to do it, and drow still takes a while to kill due to his rankings, but I’m overall very happy with it."
PathOfExileBuilds,fcmxlr4,t3_ei1z0s,1577796703.0,I’m playing coc ice nova and just holding down cyclone through entire maps. I don’t even have to pause for packs. I just blitz past them and come back if I hear a big drop.
cats,fcl1xz0,t1_fck061c,1577738040.0,I read the whole thing thinking it was the cat then was like wait a second...
PathOfExileBuilds,fckzb6i,t1_fckxy3b,1577736416.0,Fair enough. I just wonder if having one cospri’s cycle through 3 skills is too much. I guess I could always try it out.
pathofexile,fckujv7,t3_ehnacr,1577733498.0,"I actually saw a similar one on the trade site with rt. Since I made a ngamahu’s cyclone build that used rt, I knew what it meant, but new players can fall for it especially if the cospri’s is only a little cheaper. I mean, who would sell a useless item for 4 ex?"

PathOfExileBuilds,fcku18o,t3_ehq149,1577733179.0,"I did it with two rare jeweled foils. It’s not great, but it’ll do yellow maps okay. You lose a lot of clear speed and utility without them."
PathOfExileBuilds,fcktb99,t1_fcknlh3,1577732732.0,That’s a very detailed guide. It makes me wonder if I want to change my setup to be ice nova-ice bite-life leech in one cospri’s and frost bolt-frostbite-frost bomb in the other. If frost bomb is even necessary still.
PathOfExileBuilds,fckjja6,t3_ehmypb,1577726713.0,"I have ice nova-frost bolt-life leech support in one and frostbite-frost bomb-ice bite in the other. My main chest is cyclone-coc-ice nova-concentrated effect-hypothermia-increased crit strikes. If you have multiple spells in a cospri’s it alternates between them on the cospri’s cd, which I believe is 150 ms base?"
aww,fby7a6i,t3_ef20t2,1577209816.0,What a beauty! Hope he doesn’t get stressed out by the holiday festivities. I heard it’s rough for the newly adopted ones since they’re in a new environment and may not know who is boss if there are lots of visitors. But he looks happy enough!
