I used to love collecting medieval weapons. But when my daughter was born something just kind of shifted in my brain into grown-up mode. 

It wasn't even like ""man I wish I could buy more swords, but I've got a kid now. UGH"" I just totally lost all desire for them. One day I looked at my pile of weapons and they just all looked so stupid and pointless to me."

It doesn't happen often but when it does I'll keep playing scenarios over and over in my head until I feel like I'm in a panic."
