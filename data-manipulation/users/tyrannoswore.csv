It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

The Republican crowd shuffles in

There's an old man sitting next to me

Makin' love to his cousin and gin

He says,""Son, can you play me an Impeachment trial

I'm not really sure how it goes

But it's short and it's sweet and I knew it complete

When I wore a Kompromats man's clothes""

La la la, di da da

La la, di da da da dum

Sing us a song, you're Republican

Sing us a song tonight

Well, we're all in the mood for some perjury

And you've got us feelin' alright

Now Don and Bill Barr are some friends of mine

They get me my Kids for free

And he's quick with a Tweet or to hide his Tax sheet

But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, ""Bill, this Impeachment is killing me""

As the smile ran away from his face

""Well I'm sure that I could be a Oligarch

If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, di da da

La la, di da da da dum

Now Rand Paul is a bullshit novelist

Who never had time for a wife

And he's talkin' with Davy, who's never served in the Navy

And probably has Bone Spurs for life.

And Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is practicing politics

As the businessmen slowly get stoned (on Sudafed)

Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness

But it's better than drinkin' alone


Sing us a song you're Republican

Sing us a song tonight

Well we're all in the mood for a melody

And you got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for C-SPAN

And Mitch McConnell gives me a smile

'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see

To forget about life for a while

And the trial, it sounds like a carnival

And the Kavanaugh smells like a beer

And they sit with Bill Barr and put bread in my jar

And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, di da da

La la, di da da da dum

Sing us a song you're Republican

Sing us a song tonight

Well we're all in the mood for a melody

And you got us feeling alright"
