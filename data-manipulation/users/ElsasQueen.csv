AmItheAsshole,ffg0g4w,t1_ff9whm5,1579895779.0,">Yup, you cannot appreciate how much it changes your life until you're a parent. Even babysitting a niece or nephew for an entire weekend isn't a good simulation, as you know at the end of the weekend you get to just give them back.

Eh. I do agree it can't totally prepare you, but I think it can give you a good idea at times. When my niece is around, I sometimes have this conflicting feeling of ""I'm glad I get to see her"" and ""I can't wait until she leaves"". She's cute, she's extroverted, she's lively, but she's also loud, loves to scream, and never ever stops talking. I panicked once when the house was silent because I knew she was there until I saw her sleeping.

At the very least, being around her has made it clear almost any and all peace goes out the window when you're a parent. And she's not a toddler. She's nine. Now, the power arguments are starting."
