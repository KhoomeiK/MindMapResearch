Not sure if anyone else has said this but she needs a different medication if it’s not helping with her impulse control. I have depression and bipolar disorder and my medication helped with my over spending. I take generic brand Wellbutrin. Maybe her dose needs to be adjusted or something. Give her an allowance and get her more help if she wants it obviously."
