I'm fully panicking about how the hell I'm supposed to get everything done in time (especially during my busiest work season), but I *do* hate slides a little less. Saying, ""I'm just gonna do one slide tonight"" makes it sound much more feasible suddenly."
muacjdiscussion,ffd953l,t3_esnj4i,1579815852.0,"I'm sure I've done all kinds of stupid shit in the name of beauty, but by far the dumbest was letting my younger sister put ""dreads"" in my hair when I was 16 or 17. She had a tin of Murray's pomade that she used to tame flyaways, and asked if she could use it to put fake dreads in my hair. Now I'd be like, ""you know we're white, right?"" but back then I trusted her when she swore it would wash out.

Now, I don't know if anyone here has used Murray's pomade, but it's the stickiest shit in the world. You're supposed to use it sparingly. My sister did not. She put like half a tin in my fine, straight hair, did some kind of greasy twists that looked god awful, and went, ""oh yeah that looks real bad."" Cool, thanks. So I went and tried to wash it out. Nope. Tried again. Nothing. Tried different shampoo. Nah. Panicked and asked my mom for help. We tried every shampoo, dish soap, I think maybe laundry soap at some point? Nothing worked and we gave up because my hair was still a greasy mess, but now it just smelled like 10 different soaps. 

It took 2 fucking weeks to wash out completely. I went to school every day with my hair in a sad greasy bun, and then went home and shampooed 2 or 3 times every day. It finally came out the day before prom, but my hair was so soft it wouldn't stay in curls or any type of updo without serious work, so I ended up with the stiffest, most hairspray-shellecked prom hair ever. And I never let my sister touch my hair again. 

Kidding, she went to cosmetology school and I let her do even more unholy shit in the name of practice because I'm a sucker."

muacjdiscussion,ff6mgya,t1_ff67rwy,1579630340.0,"Pastels tend to look better on people with lower contrast, more muted coloring. I will link [this post](https://beginnersmakeup.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/how-to-choose-flattering-lipstick-colors/) forever, because it's one of the single most useful things I've ever found re: choosing the right makeup (and clothing). I can't always look at someone and tell warm/cool or muted/pure (low and high contrast are way easier) but looking at the range of lipstick colors in the post, it's obvious which ones are most flattering. So for me, I could see that I'm high contrast and warm-olive, and then figured out I'm muted by trial and error - a burgundy lip looks 100x better than a pure red, a rust orange is fantastic while a pure orange looks neon, etc.

All that to say that I'm happy for the people who look great in pastels because I feel like they haven't had a *ton* to work with in the last few years, but that's gonna be a hard pass for me."

TwoXChromosomes,ff25hrr,t1_ff24k5r,1579494363.0,"Hmm if you have any other forms of ID in your current name, you might still be fine with an expired license, especially if it's recently expired. Anything with a picture is best, like a work or school ID, but stuff like insurance cards, library cards, social security card will also work, especially if you have at least a couple of them in addition to your expired DL. There's also a form that a witness can fill out if you have someone who can come with you and swear that they know you under your current name, if you don't have anything else.

However, the passport is going to cost a minimum of $65 (assuming you just get a card and don't expedite) plus the cost of a photo, so it may or may not be worth it if the marriage certificate is really all the DMV needs. I kind of recommend people get passports anyway, because it's by far the best backup if an ID is lost, but it's definitely not cheap."
TwoXChromosomes,ff23o4u,t1_ff1xak1,1579492928.0,"Ok so I actually take passport applications for a living, and getting a passport is good advice - the DMV routinely sends people to us because it's easier. Do you have a driver's license in your current name? If so, it's extremely likely that you'll be fine with just your old passport and a copy of your current ID. You'll want to list your ex-husband's info on your application, but we basically never bother to get a marriage license when someone is renewing a passport expired longer than 15 years.

It obviously can't hurt to order all that stuff, but in the short term, you may not need it to get shit handled."

muacjdiscussion,fdcfl01,t3_ekkpuy,1578273679.0,"The shimmers in the Coloured Raine Queen of Hearts palette were a big one for me. It was maybe the second real, non-drugstore palette I had, and the shimmers creased SO BAD. Like within a couple of hours. They drove me nuts, and I pretty much only used the mattes for a long time. Maybe a year ago, I started using Royal Highness pretty regularly when I was in a hurry and needed a nice neutral look and it wasn't really creasing anymore and I couldn't remember why I ever thought it was bad shadow.

Yeaaaah, turns out the creasing was basically all on me, not the formula. I wasn't setting the concealer I use as eye primer well enough when I was newer to makeup and it was just more noticeable with the really creamy, shimmery shades in that particular palette. Now you'd have to pry that palette out of my cold, dead hands. I would cut a bitch for touching Dethrone, honestly."

ChoosingBeggars,fd6ttev,t1_fd6mdzr,1578195623.0,"Organic farming uses enormous amounts of pesticides. The idea that it's pesticide-free has been heavily encouraged by the industry, though they can't outright lie about it. Pesticides approved for organic use often have to be used in much higher quantities because they're less effective. If you meant they're using non-chemical pesticides, that's also untrue, since everything is chemicals.

The ratio of space:calories is also pretty bad. I think a lot of people who criticize what food banks give out aren't always thinking about practicality."

The preteen girl with the family next to her said something along the lines of that being ridiculous (but in 11 year old language). That was the rudest comment I've ever received - to my face, at least - and it was barely rude at all. I told her I know it's silly but it's fun so that's ok, and then her dad asked what the internet was going to pick for me tomorrow. :)

I do wear a lot of bright colors and dramatic looks, so I do get a lot of comments, but they're basically always positive. Also, I'm not counting the dudes who think I care if my makeup does/n't make their dicks hard, because no one should count them."

I've asked a few why they would bother when we were incompatible on such a major issue and they all told me in so many words that they thought I'd change my mind. 

Men probably aren't asking you and your wife because they're not trying to have a relationship with you and just don't care what you guys do, but plenty of them will bring it up with the people they want to date."
