It really just becomes a question of how much time you are willing to spend at the forge at that point."
unpopularopinion,fff90t6,t1_fff5yby,1579878704.0,"The whole ""I never cared"" act just looks weird when your first comments are about how much your feelings got hurt."
KotakuInAction,ff9s8t3,t1_ff9aa79,1579720087.0,"The funniest part is that they are not insanely angry because certain men will not date them.  They actually do not want to date these men either.

What they demand is that all of these men DESIRE THEM.  The idea that there are men that exist who do not find them sexy drives them to hysterics."
KotakuInAction,ff9rxle,t1_ff9kuq5,1579719857.0,"Yeah, it is data from OK Cupid.

Basically women rate 80% of men as ""below average.""  

Whereas men's ratings basically make a perfect bell curve.

Tells you all you need to know about the sexes and how they date.  It is truly beautiful data."

fatlogic,fegigxv,t3_eotyif,1579093791.0,"Notice how they wedge in the gender issue to make it seem like being fat is the same thing as gender?

Also, at no time in human history was lumps of fat and rolls seen as more attractive than fit bodies.  I do not see that changing anytime soon.  Hell, even most of these obesity advocate women refuse to date fat men.  

They know it is not attractive."
lostgeneration,feecuv3,t3_eohjpc,1579031135.0,"My father in law is a real estate agent, and one thing you learn quick is that everyone thinks their house is worth about 50k-100k more than it is.  When confronted with reality, they either accept it, or get super defensive and the house sits on the market until they come down.  

Also, people assume that because they spent 20 grand on a new kitchen, they can tack at least 20 grand onto the sell price.  Nope!

But as always, Boomers gonna Boom, so of course they crank this bullshit up to 11.  The news told them they could sell the house they bought for $40,000 forty years ago for half a million bucks, and by gum, they are going to do it!"
fatlogic,fea4ywc,t1_fe7hiow,1578944419.0,"Why would ""superfat"" come before ""largefat?""

fatlogic,fea462v,t3_envvez,1578944173.0,"One of the most distasteful parts of this whole obesity advocate movement is how they demand everyone else be just as fat, unhealthy, and unhappy as them.  

It's such a sickening mindset.  It is so perverse."
fatlogic,fdrgu3e,t3_emr6ja,1578684345.0,"To be fair, there is some truth to this take.

BMI was never meant to tell you about an individual, it was meant to measure adiposity in groups of people.  

That being said, generally speaking people with overweight BMIs are overweight due to adiposity, and BMI is a pretty good guide."
fatlogic,fdr6yvl,t1_fdqyagj,1578680306.0,Watching people root for World War III to start so they can blame and yell about Trump has been extremely disheartening.

If you have a Costco membership, I can endorse their Kirkland brand of protein bars.  They are about $17 for a box of twenty and are basically copies of the popular Quest bars."

Just wanted to point out to everyone that only gaining a few pounds over the holidays is basically a win with all the sugar and food pushing that happens.  It comes off fast once you get back to normal!"

Best soul singer of all time.  ALL TIME."
fatlogic,fdn9bng,t3_em0cro,1578580717.0,"Well, these things are obviously subjective, but the reason why Lizzo is more well known for her body than her music is because her music is fairly generic, and she only got famous because of the obesity advocate angle.  It was the proverbial foot in the door.  Her brand is mostly being a yaaaas kweeeen fat woman, not being a singer.

Hip Hop/Pop is a genre with extreme flavor of the month tendencies, and I will just leave it at that.  My subjective opinions only, of course."
gaming,fdn3u6a,t3_em3eqq,1578576489.0,"Kind of disappointed with this game.  It is very repetitive and fairly shallow, and there is way too much backtracking over the same platforming sections.  It is like they tried to copy Dark Souls with the combat and level design but were unable to deduce why those things were good in Dark Souls.   It bothers me that your attacks/defense are dependent on slow animations but your enemies' moves are not.  

The controls are sluggish and the constant slide sections are terrible and there is a reason developers stopped putting them into games 15 years ago.  

Also suffers from the ""lightsabers are just glowing bats"" syndrome, but that might be unsolvable for video games."
news,fdk94x2,t1_fdi6rmu,1578498888.0,"This case going through discovery would have been way more damaging to CNN/journalists' reputation than settling the case.

No news organization, especially one with as low quality and biased as CNN wants you to see what is behind the curtain.  The internal communications about this kid were likely pretty brutal based on the lies they told about him publicly."
unpopularopinion,fdgvbv5,t1_fdeqorb,1578409230.0,"It became very obvious when I read one about a fat woman (A) who had been bullying and shaming a skinny friend (B) for years, leading B to eventually blow up and basically tell A that she never shames her for being overweight, so she should stop shaming her for being skinny.

Person A was immediately let off the hook by the crowd for shaming a skinny woman for years, and person B was basically called a monster for suggesting a fat woman was fat one time."
