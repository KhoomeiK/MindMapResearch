AskHistorians,fdh4vsw,t1_fdgr7ej,1578415435.0,"To quote yourself right before that:


> Why did it exist and with such elaboration? > The British. (This is also why it's common 
> even to religions that reject it: the British 
> didn't exclude Christians or Muslims etc.)

>The modern caste system was created by the British in 1881. 

The you try to minimize the extent of what a caste is by trying to equate it with anybody in any profession in the west.

> You're a mixed race Democrat living in Albany and working as a school teacher named Gloria van der Wafel? What races? White and black? Oh, well we've decided that if there's a mix you count as white. Also, from your name and the place you live you're obviously Dutch. And you're a member of the school teacher profession?

So those would have been castes if the British didn’t know better? 

The fact is that castes in India are ingrained in the psyche and prevent social mobility as opposed to anything that you have compared against. 

None of the examples you provides touch on that. A weavers family would be a weaver for generations.  A priests lineage is of priests, etc. so much so that even now when we do have social mobility, marriages are mostly still within the castes. 

Regarding your comment on an axe to grind - why get rattled up when you have an opposing view? I feel you want to project India in a good light. I totally get it and it is a great country. But lets not let facts get compromised in the process."
AskHistorians,fdfxd35,t1_fdetf4l,1578372812.0,"It looks like the argument being made is that the british grouped the castes by categories (gave them names on paper). But does that mean there were no castes to begin with?

In India you can easily see that people have married with their caste for centuries and I get the feeling that this post is trying to pretend that nothing existed before the British came in.

When even the religious texts talk about varnas, marriages are bases on castes and sub castes and there are differences in religious rituals based on which caste you belong to, I think its a bit disingenuous to blame the British for creating the system that existed well before the popped in."
