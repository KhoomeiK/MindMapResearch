I’m sure your sister loves you deeply and she would be devastated if you were gone, surround yourself with people like her and do what is best for you at the moment."

introvert,feeyco0,t3_eot04w,1579043911.0,"introverted does not equal antisocial. it just means too much socialising can make you feel drained and you need to spend time alone to regain that energy. if I’m not mistaken it was aristotle who said that and he meant it in the context of a society, humans always formed communities that later turned into villages, towns etc etc, because it enabled them to survive and thrive. it doesn’t mean all humans are extroverted"
