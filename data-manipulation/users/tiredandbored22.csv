I'm really looking to strengthen more general knowledge on setting up performance templates and such.  And I want to hear your guys feedback on the usefulness of the hardware that has been optimized for Ableton."
ableton,ffkq2ls,t1_ffkpd9a,1580026906.0,"Thanks for the reply!

I've found some stuff on YouTube. Usually what I see for my style of music is a a Live set up that gets utilized by multiple performers. And the videos I find on solo performances are for EDM and hip hop. I'll keep digging around. But if anyone knows of anything off the top of their head, that would be super helpful. 

I haven't had a full night's sleep since I got Ableton hahah.. So if anyone can share resources they have come across, my brain and sanity will thank you for it."

Trust me. Generally speaking, people don't just escape. People don't escape into nothingness. They escape to access reinforcement and/or less aversive stimuli."
Drugs,fcbf7u4,t3_egvxv6,1577586121.0,"Yes and no. Some can be very dangerous. But most people who say, ""don't do drugs because they're dangerous"", oftentimes exaggerate their claims and/or don't know the actual dangers involved with using drugs.

For example, let's consider meth. People try to scare others about the dangers of meth by showing you pictures of people with fucked up teeth. There are many other dangers to worry about long before your teeth are affected. Most meth heads I know don't even have messed up teeth. They deal with a whole different set of problems that are never mentioned in the propaganda.

In my opinion, one of the most damaging effects of drugs is not directly caused by the drugs. When someone gets very involved with drug use, it can be very time consuming. That time could be spent on other areas in your life, and before you know it, those areas have been neglected and it might be too late to do anything about it once you notice."
