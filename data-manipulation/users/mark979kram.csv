I think we should admit to climate change but not guilt ourselves (.. the level of pollution BEING produced annually, regardless it's ours or naturally occurring). If anything, as humans, we have paid with climate for technological advancement that allowed us to survive in the billions when alarmists were saying we'd famish decades ago, more healthy today than anytime, more wealthy, more more more.

I believe that technological advancement will one day provide the opportunity to STABILISE the climate that is NATURALLY shifting and always has, throughout earth's history, millions of years before our industrial revolution.
So, let's not pretend we know everything and that we have solved earth's climate equation and in result slow advancement with policies aimed at reducing consumption instead of increasing efficiency.

We have it good in civilized countries.. how about the poor countries? Should they also go green or should they be allowed to use petrol to grow out of the dark ages? Because let's face it, green =/= efficient, Germany has tried it and failed miserably. They realized wind and sun are not as reliable as everyone believes, grid was constantly underpowered, they had to start the nuclear grid several times on short notice resulting in a carbon footprint larger than usual.

I think we should admit to climate change but not guilt ourselves (.. the level of pollution BEING produced annually, regardless it's ours or naturally occurring). If anything, as humans, we have paid with climate for technological advancement that allowed us to survive in the billions when alarmists were saying we'd famish decades ago, more healthy today than anytime, more wealthy, more more more.

I believe that technological advancement will one day provide the opportunity to STABILISE the climate that is NATURALLY shifting and always has, throughout earth's history, millions of years before our industrial revolution.
So, let's not pretend we know everything and that we have solved earth's climate equation and in result slow advancement with policies aimed at reducing consumption instead of increasing efficiency.

We have it good in civilized countries.. how about the poor countries? Should they also go green or should they be allowed to use petrol to grow out of the dark ages? Because let's face it, green =/= efficient, Germany has tried it and failed miserably.
