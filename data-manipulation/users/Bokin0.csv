""The following recommendations are for treating Nosema disease caused by Nosema apis;
however another species of Nosema, Nosema ceranae has also been found in Manitoba. Current
research suggests that both species of Nosema respond to antibiotic treatment but that more
information is needed to determine if modifications to the Fumagilin-B® label will be required for
the effective control of both species.""

Personally I would be hesitant to use Fumagillin on Nosema C right now until some research comes out proving that it helps survivability."
Beekeeping,ffe3mnr,t1_ffdsrwz,1579835829.0,Another company is now making Fumagillin again for Canada.
Beekeeping,ffawl8n,t1_ffaoz15,1579746171.0,"Get to the shop 30 minutes after your supposed to

Drink coffee for an hour while shooting the shit

Load up the equipment for the day but forget a bunch of shit

Stop for energy drinks

Drive 40 - 60 minutes to yard

Work for 30 minutes stop to drink coffee

Eat lunch cause its already 12

Work for 30 minutes stop to drink coffee. Repeat until time to leave or work done in yard.

Wrap things up so you can get back to the farm and leave everything on the trucks so you can get to the bar for happy hour."
Beekeeping,ffamhi3,t3_esg7n3,1579739410.0,Oh what I wouldn't give to be working the bees right now. When and how long is your off season down there if you have one? We are still at least a couple months away from moving the bees out of the wintering shed and its driving me nutty.
Beekeeping,femj6jq,t1_femgx9c,1579258295.0,Pretty common around here. At least in my experience your hands aint gonna get hit unless the boys around you are not careful.
Beekeeping,felx1nd,t1_feltj37,1579233087.0,Hmm I will have to ask the higher ups why they decided to do the pallets that way. If their is an interesting reason I'll hit comment again.
Beekeeping,felklex,t1_felk03m,1579224421.0,"Most of the equipment is newer at this point but one my uncle's has pointed out bottom boards he made when he was a teenager and he's in his 50s now. My Grandpa has also pointed out a couple of frames that are still around that his dad made. How on earth those slipped through the frame purges we do and just survive in general I have no idea.

Also we only switched to 4 way pallets about 10 years ago before that our forklift could only handle 2 way pallets before we made some alterations."
Beekeeping,feljozz,t1_felhqxr,1579223806.0,Interesting. Most of the guys in our area uses seperate bottom boards and all but a couple use telescoping lids. I imagine it's because when most of these farms were started everything was still moved by hand.
Beekeeping,felbcg6,t1_fel8fgh,1579218190.0,Best part about winter in the north. Beers warm? Just toss it in the snow outside and it will be ice cold in 5 minutes!
Beekeeping,felb9pg,t1_fel8pa6,1579218138.0,You want the entrances facing towards the peasants so when you bin a pallet the bees target them first. Giving you time to scamper off and find something to do while they clean up your mess.
Beekeeping,feky1ri,t1_feknolv,1579209968.0,Who am I to deny a bee a drink.
Warhammer40k,fdsix7s,t1_fdrcxba,1578703627.0,Not op but I just got into the game and chose Ultramarines. Tbh I really wanted to do another chapter but Cato Sicarius is clearly the greatest warrior in the galaxy and I couldn't betray the most noble and glorious of the Ultramarines.
educationalgifs,fdhxx3b,t1_fddkqui,1578432165.0,Afaik they would not fight eachother at the source but open feeding can lead to increased robbing activity between hives. As this can lead to increased disease transmission open feeding of sugar syrup is illegal in some areas. Not sure if open pollen feeding is illegal as well.
educationalgifs,fdfsj7d,t1_fdfoo9z,1578369130.0,Also if we had enough maple syrup to feed our bees with we wouldn't be bothering to keep bees lol. We use about 7-10k gallons of sugar syrup a year.
educationalgifs,fdf80tu,t1_fde8x9b,1578355443.0,They do. Bees primary feed is honey or sugar syrup. Adult bees live mostly off of honey with a little bit of pollen for protein. The larvae are then fed the stored pollen.
educationalgifs,fdf7rd7,t1_fdeh6m2,1578355269.0,Usually a protein powder such as brewers yeast or soy mixed together with some extra stuff so the bees like the smell and such.
educationalgifs,fdf7c96,t1_fde4688,1578354990.0,$$$
educationalgifs,fddi9fq,t1_fdde1k1,1578313383.0,Nah. Supplementing pollen and feed to your hives when needed is just part of proper hive management. Everyone I know of here in Canada uses pollen powder/patties and sugar syrup.
educationalgifs,fddhprs,t1_fdd7eh2,1578312753.0,You can buy pollen supplement in 50lb bags. It's just some sort of protein powder like brewers yeast or soy with some extra goodies mixed in so the bees like it.
Beekeeping,fcanv8u,t1_fbhmq0g,1577572984.0,Yep that will work fine.
farming,f8dfedv,t1_f8czp7a,1574488542.0,I know a CN conductor and from what I have heard its about working conditions. The hours they have to work are genuinely so bad that it is impossible to have a life outside of work. That and some actually unsafe work conditions. And I mean it isn't representative of the general view of the conductors and certainly not the union but I have heard that some would take a pay cut to get more reasonable hours and safer working conditions.
