Advice,fejluyb,t3_ephod6,1579179280.0,Alright I’ve passed through this same thing a few years back. I am about to start med school this summer and I am still gaming almost everyday. I don’t think playing games affects your ability to do well in school. What I do regret about spending so much time gaming is that sometimes I’d settle for something like studying for a C instead of an A so I can get that extra hour or so. My advice to you is that you keep gaming as a part of your (daily if you so choose) life but don’t let it tempt you into staying mediocre when you can be great. Study for that A even if it means 2 hours of gaming instead of 4. Best of luck dude
