That interview uniquely demonstrates the entirety of the Trump/Republican mindset of facts be damned, public opinion be damned, basic respect for news be damned all to either muddy the waters further with their doublespeak or to protect their own self interest of not getting found out as some of the most corrupt public servants in the history of our country.

Would love to see a day when he and the rest of this corrupt administration is found guilty of treason or any other number of their high crimes and misdemeanors committed against our country.

Subject: Impeachment is National Security 

Dear Senator,

 I was born in ______ (or I have lived in _____ for ___ years).  I am ___ years old.  I have found myself all over the political spectrum throught my years growing up. As an adult, I can only call myself independent. Both parties have veered so far to the extremes sometimes it's frightening.

This impeachment is important and historical. Politics aside, when the EXECUTIVE branch obstructs our LEGISLATURE, your branch, it alone is enough to be impeached and removed. 

Please consider Rep. Schiff's remarks during yesterday's closing argument. You can watch it here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=ecpF26eMV3U

Please take the 9 minutes today to truly listen and watch it. Imagine there is no letter next to his name. He is an American elected official concerned about what is right.

What has been going on in this country for almost a generation of hyper partisanship, endless spending,endless war, etc has resulted in an America that doesn't feel right anymore. 

Please do what is right and vote to impeach the President. Abuse of Power, Obstruction, these should not be up for debate and put in the spin zone. That response would be dangerous to our future. You must look at the facts, check your R or D at the door and vote as if on an impartial jury.

If you do not, I will donate to and vote for your competitors if ever primaried and I will donate to and vote for your main opponent in any future election. No. Matter. What. The importance of your vote here can not be overstated for our state, for our country, for our collective futures. Please do what is right and remove this President before any more damage to our country and body politic can be done. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Most respectfully,

dankmemes,fdlrg6y,t3_elw5ow,1578530729.0,"PSA: If you experience regular daytime sleepiness even after what should be restful sleep, you could have sleep apnea.

Sleep apnea is a medical condition where you literally stop breathing during your sleep. By definition, an apnea event is 10+ seconds where you literally stop breathing.  You can also experience hypoapneas where your breathing is super shallow for 10+ seconds due to a partially blocked airway.  For persons with just mild sleep apnea, you can easily have 10 apnea events an hour!

Sleep apnea can have a profound effect on your physical and mental health if left untreated. If you experience daytime sleepiness or fatigue, wake up with headaches, have been told you are a loud snorer, have problems with memory and concentration, have insomnia or wake up at night feeling short of breath, you could have sleep apnea. Risk factors are obesity, smoking, family history, diabetes and sex (men experience more than women).

Long story short, if you don't feel rested after 6-8 hours of sleep, you could have sleep apnea.  The only way to know for sure is to talk with your primary care provider who can get your started on doing a sleep study. Many people think you have to go sleep somewhere and that just isn't the case anymore. Many times you can do it at home by yourself.

Note- I am not a doctor. I have family experience with sleep apnea."

Don't mess this up DNC. Do the right thing now at the expense of pleasing any of the old guard who thinks it's their turn or their guy or gal's turn. Unfortunately, their turn coincides with an existential crisis for our democracy. 

Bernie Sanders must be the Democratic candidate for 2020. There is no other option considering the opponent and who he (mostly) represents: the right wing conglomerate of hyper-capitalists (read: fascists), the Trump worshippers and enablers, the regressives, the dog-whistled racists and misogynists, the people who think life is a chan meme or joke, the foreign actors influencing and imperiling our power domestically and internationally, the Religious Right^TM , etc.

This American minority has hijacked our country through gerrymandering, court packing, obstruction, corruption and sometimes what our Founders would call High Crimes, Misdemeanors and downright Treasonous Acts. I do not say this lightly.

We are running out of time before the generational cycle of ~20 years ends, the new voters think this is normal, and we are unable to even go back to 10 years ago, before the Citizens United decision. The time is now or never.  Educate yourself and others. Plead with misled or duped family and friends. Some are honestly embarrassed in secret and don't want to admit they could ever have voted for Trump. But its OK. We forgive you. We are all upset and tired of the rigged game.  We want stability, peace and jobs. We want to do the right things in our society and the world.  We want to help our allies and help our neighbors. We want universal.healthcare via Medicare for All. We want universal education for those who want it so that we can never flirt with this political distaste again. We want a Public Works procram so that anybody who wants to work can and will, while also receiving a liveable wage. It worked in the New Deal. It can work again. Tax the 1%. Don't believe the Fox News and corporate-centrist Democrat propaganda for one second.
