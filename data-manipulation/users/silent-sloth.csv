boxoffice,ffken71,t1_ffjv42d,1580021512.0,"Yeah, I expect this movie to be *very* low (I’m guess 30-40%), but it’s pretty hard to get that low. I’m not discounting it, but I would be mildly surprised if it was below 16.5%."
boxoffice,ffkb9e8,t1_ffk9hza,1580019953.0,That’s a pretty damn long time for comic book movies. Almost the entirety of the MCU’s Phase 3 came out since then (8 out of 11). It came out in between Guardian 2 and Spider-Man: Homecoming.

boxoffice,ffk05sj,t1_ffjnsaa,1580011791.0,"Wonder Woman was *years* ago now, and it came out in the same wave of movies as BvS, Justice League and Suicide Squad; and the consensus on Aquaman was that it was just okay—good by DC standards—but not great. I wouldn’t consider either of these indicators of an upswing for DC. 

Shazam and Joker are good signs, though. Hopefully WW1984 will be help continue this trend if Harley Quinn really does end up being a flop though."
patientgamers,ffjzl10,t1_ffjcovc,1580011312.0,"I’m curious, how replayable is this game?

I got the “best” ending (or at least one of the better endings, don’t totally remember, it was like two years ago) on my first play-through in one night and I just assumed that there wasn’t much point in replaying, but this thread has me really curious. Was my assumption wrong, is there a lot of replayability to this game?"

Tinder,ffi2012,t1_ffhsbve,1579962719.0,"This 100%. 

1.	What exactly is dystopian about looking for sex on the internet? That seems like a pretty massive improvement from a hundred years ago where your pool was the people you grew up near, and you were shamed for having sex out of wedlock. 
2.	Very “wE LiVE iN A SoCiEtY” type content. 
3.	This just gives off like a lot of desperation, to the extent that I feel like you’d almost have better odds opening with something stupidly forward like “wanna sex?”
4.	If this person wants to have a brief conversation first to gauge wether you’re a normal person and wether you might have some kind of connection, where can they even go from there?"
wholesomememes,ffi1ao3,t1_ffi0nu5,1579962078.0,"Not everything is the massive, hundred-plus-people, lecture-hall classes that are done at many state schools.

StarWars,ff7ph9x,t1_ff7ljpk,1579655176.0,"Obviously Darth Bane comes before Mace Windu in-universe, but I was curious if there were any characters with purple lightsabers prior to the real-world release of Attack of the Clones (which establish Mace Windu and purple sabers)? 

Looks like Darth Bane first appeared with a purple saber in issue #1 of “Jedi vs. Sith” which released in April 2001. Attack of the Clones released after that in May 2002, but filming would’ve began prior to it in June of 2000. So while it would’ve been known internally that Mace Windu would have a purple saber for Attack of the Clones when “Jedi vs. Sith” came out, “Jedi vs. Sith” seems to be the first time the public would’ve been exposed to canonical purple lightsabers, since the earliest promotional material for Attack of the Clones didn’t come out for another year (as far as I can tell).

I’d be curious to learn if Darth Bane had a purple saber because of the decision to give Mace Windu one in the upcoming movie, or if it was just a coincidence that the two came out so close to one another."
politics,ff7m7ie,t1_ff7hfoh,1579652890.0,"That’s not how that fallacy works. That fallacy is essentially applying the traits of an individual to a larger group that individual is/was a part of.

In this case, Hillary is being criticized because she closely associated with someone she likely knew engaged in illegal sex trafficking. It would qualify if they had said something to the extent of, Epstein was a sex-trafficking pedophile, Hillary was friends with Epstein, therefore Hillary must also be a sex trafficking pedophile. But they’re not assigning the traits of Epstein to a larger group via association, they’re just saying that association with Epstein isn’t a good thing."

TheSilphRoad,ff6xqnt,t1_ff6sqrj,1579637056.0,"I've said this many times, but I think a lot of the problems with Pokemon Go are probably the fault of TPC. You can even see this way back at launch, there's an old E3 interview with a combination of some Nintendo/TPC people and Niantic people, and it's very clear in that interview that TPC is pushing for a much earlier release of the game than Niantic is ready for.

Games,fdrvllx,t1_fdqqgx2,1578690358.0,"One of my CS professors who used to work in the games industry told us once, “if you can do anything else in software and be happy, then you should do that instead.”

There’s a very intentional churn to the industry. They take in new employees, suck them dry with ridiculous expectations, and once they’re burnt out they replace them with new employees.

For software engineers, it’s one of the only positions you can take where you don’t have crazy leverage over your employer. The demand for programmers in the gaming industry is much lower than everywhere else, because there are proportionately more software engineers who want to do games. The result is worse pay, benefits and general working conditions compared to everything else you could do with the same degree."
