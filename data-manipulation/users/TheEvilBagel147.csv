trashy,ffaf5o2,t1_ffa47zd,1579734278.0,"I always felt like having 18 be the age of consent makes sense, but allow an age gap of up to 3 years.  So, someone who is 17 could legally be with someone who is up to 20 years old.  A 15 year-old can legally be with an 18 year-old, but no one older.  Once you are 18, there is no maximum age gap for being with anyone who is also at least 18.  Then you could place a bottom limit on this, like maybe 12, so no one of any age could legally be with someone younger than that.  You could also modify it further and reduce the age gape to only 1 or 2 years for anyone under 15.

The point is, having it just be 18 and that's it is stupid because you basically end up making the majority of highschool relationships illegal.  And then you're gonna ruin an 18 year-old HS senior's life because he had sex with/had pics of his sophomore girlfriend?  The fuck?"

Do these people really just place such blind faith in complete strangers when it comes to their life?  Or have they just given up and don't even care anymore?  Idk.  Either way, the thought of everything I would have to go through if I ever did hit one of those fuckers pisses me off."

Oil companies will rebrand and start dealing in renewable energy, mark my words.

They knew what they were doing since the '70s, and they are anything but stupid."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdebmum,t3_ekuib5,1578335481.0,"Oil companies aren't denying climate change.  They are deliberately slowing the transition and removing subsidies so that they can control the renewables market sans-competition.  Notice how big companies like Shell are now going public with their massive investments in renewable energy.  That's because they are not stupid enough to buy their own bullshit: they knew what they were doing from the beginning.  Now that push has finally come to shove, they want to make sure their bread is buttered on the profitable side.

It's shitty, but let's not pretend oil companies are clueless.  They know exactly what's up, and when all is said and done they will be the same companies selling you your solar panels (but under a different brand, of course).  So welcome to the dystopian future, because you're in it."

dankchristianmemes,fdbnfxp,t1_fdavo3f,1578259100.0,"Religion is tribalist.  In fact, I bet that's why we have religion at all: it evolved to encourage the cohesion of individuals into a strong social group by providing a unifying ideology.  There is evidence that ""belief"" is determined by a specific region of the brain, IIRC in the left temporal lobe.  A region that probably would not have evolved if it was not beneficial to have spiritual and religious beliefs.  

So any harm that religion causes is from its capacity to encourage xenophobia by creating an ingroup (believers) and an outgroup (non-believers).  Which is just a result of its inherently tribalist nature.  Which is just a result of *our* inherently tribalist nature.  Certainly it is not the cause of all the world's evils, humans get tribalist about the stupidest shit regardless of religion.  But on the whole, I would probably argue that religion in this era is more harmful than beneficial.  

But I'm not one of those edgelords in r/atheism telling people ""hurr durr you're a Christian you must be stupid""."

You don't even need much selective pressure, genetic drift alone will eventually result in enormous divides.  That being said, assuming that travel between systems remains relatively frequent, it probably won't happen.  

However, I do wonder at the challenge of maintaining a centralized governing system across multiple star systems.  From a logistical standpoint, it seems like a real doozy.  Likely each system would mostly function autonomously."

Maybe they would develop an alternative in short order or maybe it would prove too technical a challenge, and it would significantly delay their entry into space.  Either way it would be interesting to see a civilization that developed under such circumstances.  Perhaps if it did prove too difficult to get to space they would instead become significantly more advanced in other ways.  But at the end of the day, all we can do is speculate."
