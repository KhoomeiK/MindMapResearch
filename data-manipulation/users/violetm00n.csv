LifeProTips,fecocj4,t1_fec9k39,1578979024.0,Is that something you can use with your library card as well?

ambien,fe0pbsu,t3_efzaya,1578817102.0,Just discovered this subreddit. I wasnâ€™t on reddit back then but when I was prescribed ambien for insomnia I would have to check my twitter every morning to delete whatever weird thing i posted that night
LifeProTips,fdzz12c,t1_fdygz8u,1578799217.0,My boyfriend set a big wad of cash there one time. We were freaking out looking for it everywhere. Luckily it didnâ€™t fall off when I was driving and I noticed it there.
cats,fdtua5p,t1_fdtnsdm,1578722310.0,"It was just her annual checkup and vaccinations. I donâ€™t know how to use imgur, but I do have pictures of her on here if you click on my profile. Sheâ€™s the black kitty :)"

cats,fdoqqvo,t3_em9s6d,1578610783.0,Just took my girl to the vet today and she did the same thing. Then as soon as sheâ€™s out of the crate everythingâ€™s fine lol
relationship_advice,fdoprsv,t3_em99hd,1578610132.0,"My dad was like this. My mom waited way to long to leave him and he left her in a lot of debt. If you were already thinking about leaving I think your right. After my sister, mom and I moved out our lives got a lot better and with my mom not having to support my bum ass dad anymore she was a lot less stressed and no longer had to work two jobs. You are still young and you still have a chance to make life better for yourself and your children. Whatever you decide I hope that everything works out for you."
LifeProTips,fdlyywr,t3_em0suj,1578535849.0,I remember as a kid I could jump rope forever. Now I wouldnâ€™t even last a minute tbh

AmItheAsshole,fd87ur3,t3_ek965p,1578214941.0,"NTA Sounds like he has a drinking problem and since heâ€™s going to be a father now he need to fix it fast. I grew up with an alcoholic father and it really only got worse as the years went by and he didnâ€™t try to get help. It fucked me and my sister up pretty bad. Not saying your bf is like that or will be like that, but if this is his response to you asking him to stop drinking he really needs to get his priorities straight. Good luck with your pregnancy and I hope that things work out for you."
