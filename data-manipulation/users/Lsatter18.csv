chicago,ffsfhfs,t1_ffqhsk7,1580180421.0,"Ukrainian Village is more neighborhood-y and a bit grungier, with better food. Old Town doesn't feel like a neighborhood at all, not great food, but on the plus side it is right by the lake, and it is good for sports bars if you're into that."
chicago,ffsdaaw,t1_ffrwwan,1580178948.0,"Snowfall in Boston is going to be more intense, though it's definitely colder in Chicago. 

The average temperature is probably only 5 degrees colder but I have found that this hourly tracker on WeatherSpark gives you a better sense on how to compare two similar cities, [Chicago](https://weatherspark.com/y/14091/Average-Weather-in-Chicago-Illinois-United-States-Year-Round) versus [Boston](https://weatherspark.com/y/26197/Average-Weather-in-Boston-Massachusetts-United-States-Year-Round). And this is with the temperature being taken in the shade, so because Chicago is cloudier, it will likely feel colder as well.

That being said, it's not *that* much colder than Boston. Working remotely will also help you avoid the worst of it. 

Chicago has great value though, much much better bang for your buck than Boston."

soccer,ffs1bfo,t1_ffs0q8i,1580170722.0,"I get why the club would want it, I'm just interested in why it would be different in Spain vs England (or if it is different, for that matter)"
soccer,ffs0zh6,t1_ffs0utc,1580170495.0,"That was my instinct, but it seemed like too little of a difference. Maybe I am wrong about small clubs supporting it I guess."
soccer,ffrzi9c,t1_ffry8gk,1580169479.0,"Not personally no, but a bit on reddit. Guess I should be skeptical of fans with flairs of small Spanish clubs considering they're likely Madrid or Barca fans in disguise though."
soccer,ffry1gb,t1_ffrxc74,1580168488.0,Why would that change whether or not the smaller leagues support it though?
soccer,ffrtm2n,t3_eumkl6,1580165549.0,"I feel like there was pretty good support for the Spanish cup change to a single match, particularly from small clubs. Why is this so different changing the FA cup to a single match?"
nyc,ffndjeh,t1_ffiv8te,1580064546.0,"I don't particularly care about this rule, as I'm not sure it's a detriment. Potentially, it is more green friendly to be cash-free, but otherwise meh."
nyc,ffnd1p5,t1_ffkqxjk,1580064468.0,"I never elaborated on reasoning, but I said that it is good for public ventures, and not private. One can easily make an inference based on the language that what you said is the reasoning I have used."
nyc,ffiqjox,t1_ffiq96c,1579980221.0,"I believe that certain private ventures should have a different level of protection than public, is that really so bizarre?"
nyc,ffikhq4,t1_ffgpjaz,1579976039.0,"Not a fan of deli salads. Overpriced yes, but probably the best value compared to Chopt (which sucks) or Sweetgreen (which is just too damn expensive)."

nyc,ffik82m,t1_ffi5gfa,1579975853.0,The dos toros in Brookfield accepts card only and man it’s so fast. I don’t think this law is that great since it’s covering private ventures but totally see it’s value for the public.

chicago,ffdq1c4,t1_ffco2wj,1579826214.0,If you go at offpeak hours the busses aren't bad at all. I used to take the halsted bus from past belmont all the way down to UIC for my 11am classes.

chicago,feymknr,t1_feslf5y,1579447618.0,">I've had some friends recommend Wicker Park or Logan Square and they seem fun. I'm a younger guy in my 20s, so I want somewhere within walking distance of restaurants, bars, music venues, and the blue line.

Your best option is going to be those areas then, unless you want to live very close to downtown.

>Also, any advice on owning a car out here? Have to decide whether to sell my car or drive it out.

The vast majority of people here own cars, so my advice would be to keep it."

The combination of Chicago's high violent crime rate and the fact you use public transportation a lot is something to note. Safer neighborhoods can border some very unsafe ones. Are you not going to be living in student housing?"
chicago,fdwyw7u,t1_fdwg1wb,1578763669.0,"Yeah miserable is definitely hyperbole, and definitely not a carefully selected word. A better word would be limiting."
chicago,fdwypa9,t1_fdwwvni,1578763611.0,">Or you need to be more realistic and lower your standards/expectations slightly.

Miserable was definitely hyperbole, but my point was that $34k is more limiting than $60k in nyc. Which is pretty much agreeing with what you said."
chicago,fdwez96,t1_fdwb13d,1578758037.0,"Yeah, should have rephrased. It certainly wasn't miserable for me but I was fortunate to have a paid off car (and no loans). Apparently I'm in the minority for thinking that having a car in Chicago, while not *necessary* is a massive massive plus which makes the calculation different. There's a reason twice as many households in Chicago have a car vs New York."
chicago,fdtmpgh,t1_fdtlom0,1578719000.0,It’s probably using the same COL calculator is my guess. I have seen that number pop up several times.
chicago,fdtkanp,t1_fdtk02n,1578717984.0,"Yeah, I was not agreeing with the figures there. Just that it’s wildly more expensive."
chicago,fdtcve2,t1_fdtasqa,1578714956.0,"I enjoy working downtown, but I felt on $34k it can be tasking to find someplace with a decent commute that is safe, and is not in a neighborhood where a car makes life much easier."
chicago,fdtbcxj,t1_fdt9tfc,1578714367.0,"Agreed on that actually, my entire point was that the original figure was the highest i'd ever seen."
chicago,fdt99d0,t1_fdt3y3r,1578713584.0,"I never said you need a car for reasonable rent. I said that areas you live in on $34k will be substantially improved by having a car. West Town isn't a bad shout, but when I lived there I still had two regularly take two busses to get to the north side.

>Compared to NY it's just light years more affordable.

I agree with you there. But to me it's not as big as $34k to $60k. I've seen other calculators put it at $34-$49 which I'd say is much more accurate."
chicago,fdt2ph8,t1_fdsrn03,1578711144.0,"After thinking about it, I wouldn't even know how to calculate it because so many things are subjective about it. 

To me living on $34k in Chicago while needing to work downtown is miserable, especially when you add in the fact that cheaper areas will have their QoL vastly improved by a car."
chicago,fdspzzu,t1_fdsjdn2,1578706447.0,"As someone who has lived in both.. this just feels wrong. I don’t think the difference is as much as this is saying, although it depends if they’re just saying manhattan."

nyc,fdemxxg,t1_fdehh7l,1578342411.0,Chipotle certainly does.
nyc,fddk918,t1_fddck47,1578315537.0,Same way that chipotle and dos toros aren’t Mexican.
nyc,fctbhuq,t1_fct7u0z,1577938124.0,"Even if this taco is better than any taco in LA, it wouldn’t matter. Tacos and Mexican food in general are much better in LA than NYC."

soccer,fc21890,t1_fc20d8v,1577336444.0,"The second one I think, given that you actually put together a team that will fit. But not sure tbh.. a well coached team of really good players is arguably better."
