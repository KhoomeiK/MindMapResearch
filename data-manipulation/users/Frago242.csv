The tour guides are frankly sad and a bit embarrassed by this fact but fully explained how they have tried and the history behind this fact and getting it changed. There is more interesting stuff about this topic as well from a comment I had made on a recent post:

""Went to Dachau Concentration Camp recently. Pretty shitty how after the war and to this day the official art memorial doesn't recognize German criminals, prostitutes, and homosexuals that died in the camp due to these things were all illegal in Germany during the time the memorial was built in 1968 so the artist chose not to put these folks in. Over time the artist at public request changed his mind and created the additional art installation add ins that would include these folks however before he was able to add them, he died and the installation had a can't be changed unless artist approves policy for something like 75 years...well that fell now to his relatives and they said nope don't add in the extra stuffs...so now they are stuck with it as is for awhile longer..."""
