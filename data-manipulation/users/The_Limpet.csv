blackmagicfuckery,ffebh3r,t1_ffe91zy,1579842139.0,">There are three main differences between Bocce and Lawn Bowling. First,  the Bocce Ball is round and the Lawn Bowl is round in only one direction  and elliptical in the other.  Second, the Bocce Ball is thrown under  hand, like softball, and the Lawn Bowl is rolled.  The Bocce court is  sand or long grass and usually measures 10 feet by 76 feet.  The Lawn  Bowling Rink is bent grass and is usually 19 feet by 120 feet. Both play  to an object ball called a PALLINO in Bocce and a JACK in Lawn Bowling.

theouterworlds,fdnnsbj,t1_fdnlfsc,1578589616.0,"Damage matters vs armoured enemies. Armour takes an amount off every hit. So if an ememy's armour reduces incoming damage by 10 then you'll do more damage with a 100 damage weapon that shoots once per second than a 20 damage automatic that shoots 5 times per second, despite their dps being the same."
theouterworlds,fdnmxl1,t3_embo60,1578589134.0,"You deal 58 damage per strike. If you struck 3 times per second it would be 174 dps.

With dps of 142 you hit roughly 2.45 times a second. So if you're strictly counting seconds you would strike twice in second #1 and three times in second #2. Dps is the average damage you deal in sustained combat.

ed: Actually it'd be more like 2; 2; 3, but you get the idea."

They had trade with Earth until the last couple of years and the game explicitly references other colonies that they trade with. The game's great, but the lack of food plot point needs to be taken with a good pinch of suspended disbelief."

If you're playing a harder difficulty temperament is useful as it increases your health regen. If you lower intelligence below average you get extra \[Dumb\] conversation options. For the skills, dialogue options such as Intimidate, Persuade and Lie give you extra ways to interact with npcs and complete quests. Science can be very useful to reduce the cost of upgrading your weapons and armour."
