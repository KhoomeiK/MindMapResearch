mtgfinance,fd7p5we,t3_ek8vh1,1578207926.0,"As a reminder to everyone - this combo doesn't have to be playable in EDH or even good for Shielded by Faith to be bought out. You don't have to understand EDH to spec on EDH and I've been pretty hesistant to buy cards in unplayable combos only for the cards to sell out. 

Now specs like this are stressful for a lot of reasons. On one end, you're going to struggle with supply. Unlike most EDH specs that are predicted a few weeks in advance, if you're buying while everyone else is, a lot of your orders are going to get cancelled. Some are legitimate cancellations that happen when cards are listed on multiple platforms and sell out before the system can update due to the buying frenzy.  Some are people being greedy. You're going to have a hard time competing with everyone else for copies. 

After you have your copies, you're going to compete with everyone else to sell them. The more playable and interesting a combo is, the more likely you are to sell out. The less playable, the less demand there is. Ask people who bought a bunch of Waiting in the Weeds when they announced the cats deck or Vendilion Clique when they posted the phrase ""Fairy Tales"" and people said ""DID THEY SAY FAERIES?"" how many copies they still have.

I usually stay away from specs like this but I do think that Shielded by Faith probably goes up if mtg finance twitter gets a whiff of this. Someone is going to make money, some people are going to lose money. Be quick or be dead, here."
