FrankOcean,feeciu5,t1_fee9umk,1579030940.0,When they’re on iTunes there should be a little cloud on the right when you have it highlighted. If it doesn’t work you have to activate that feature on your settings.

FrankOcean,fedr9c7,t1_fedqu8j,1579018176.0,"Downloaded rips of Cayendo, Dear April, and Little Deamon. They’re all live versions, but I’m so thirsty that idc. Then I formatted them to my liking and added album covers on iTunes on PC or Mac, and added them to my cloud. 

And DHL, and In My Room are streaming."
depression,fe8lb9f,t3_enrs4c,1578927470.0,"I also use this justification to convince myself it’s okay to cry. 

Imagine a child; that ahold would cry if they dropped their candy and couldn’t eat it anymore. Because that candy was their world at the moment. It means as much to them, as maybe our phones to us, or our keys for example. 

So even though to everyone else, a kid dropping their candy is super minuscule and something not to cry about, it doesn’t matter because everyone sees everything differently. 

To someone, losing a loved one isn’t such a big of a deal. To another it could mean the world. 

Someone wouldn’t care if they get cheated on, but another would probably commit double homicide and suicide, 

To one person, being sad about losing an emotionally valuable autographed baseball is something to cry over; to another it doesn’t mean anything.

It’s all perspective, and we all have our own which is why we shouldn’t see anyone’s problems bigger than another’s because their world is different. 

So at the end of the day, no matter how strongly you feel about how ‘dumb’ your issue might be; it isn’t, simply because it means something to YOU, so it’s important."
depression,fe8j8ec,t3_enrs4c,1578926723.0,"Absolutely. Especially because I convinced myself that my problems are a result of my own doing. I physically can’t even mutter the words out because I feel like I’m just looking for sympathy. 

It’s crazy because it’s what I want as well, I want someone to feel bad for me. But me realizing that I realize that made me realize that talking of my issues is just my own show. Again, because I convinced myself that my problems are my own doing. 

I even laugh at myself whenever I cry because of how ridiculous I see myself, and realizing that is super weird because lots of people can’t explain their problems or articulate them too well. But not me, I know where my problem stems from, down to my experiences in childhood; and that realization makes me feel like I’m just making everything up. Almost like I enjoy being depressed and enjoy shutting myself out and having anxiety attacks where I laugh and cry at the same time. 

It’s a really deep hole that has me even questioning whether or not I should post this comment because in my head it seems like my problem is practically made up. 

I’ve had too much time alone."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fe004vi,t1_fdzzv3o,1578799887.0,"But to answer your question, if you’re looking for a 2D experience, consider getting Hollow Knight, or Moonlighter, both games I put 30+ hours into and had a blast."

I’d recommend finding a ps3 and getting Skate 3."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fdzwr4n,t3_enfrdn,1578797663.0,"Base game is great, I’ve been playing it on PS4 cause I got it on sale as well. IMO only a couple DLC’s are really game changing. And I had a hard time figuring out if it held a candle to the PC version; but you can do so much with your city. You can’t make it as big as on PC but the cities are still really big on PS4 going on a 4x4 grid if I’m not mistaken."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdzwh0z,t3_eng120,1578797464.0,"Lord almighty, I spent 70+ hours on Fire Emblem to the point where I had to put it down. I absolutely fell in love with every single aspect of the game, especially being able to manage your party with the class like system. 

And if you like open world games, BotW will keep you busy as well, it’s a must have for switch owners IMO"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdzwcdd,t3_enh13x,1578797371.0,"Mario + Rabbids was surprisingly very fun, if you like to play turn based games like XCom, or the OG Fallouts, that’s the game for you. 

I absolutely LOVED Moonlighter, it had a really nice game loop of going to collect stuff in dungeons and selling them at your store. Being able to figure out the best prices for items was so much fun for me. I loved organizing everything and making my store look the best, then leaving at night to go get more things to sell."

buildapcforme,fd5jb90,t1_fd5isyp,1578178220.0,"I see. Reason I asked for an upgrade as oppose to a whole new build was because I looked on a website that compares my specs to games I wanted to play, and most of the tome I just had to upgrade my cpu and video card on the recommended specs. 

So I though building a whole new pc would be unnecessary. Especially cause I won’t be playing all the new games on it."
