dogs,feiu8e8,t3_epaan5,1579147351.0,"My pup is still cautious of other people coming over but we have learned things to adapt. Friends and family that will be over a lot, we tell them to ignore her when they first come in. They are (thankfully) great with this. Once she is calm we give the person a high value treat (slice of hot dog, corner of a cheese slice, part of a piece of deli meat - nothing we give her on the regular but things we know she  loves) then the person gives her the treat. Sometimes they have to be not even looking at her, normal conversation with us and palm up offering the treat to her down below (it feels like a doggie drug deal lol). My cousin was the original test subject for this and our now freaks out when she sees his truck pull in - out of excitement. We also did a lot of walking in public where she is contained (harness on) and there were a lot of new things to smell and people to look at. If she doesn’t like a person (which unfortunately still happens) we just step to the side of the walk, make her sit, tell the person sorry for our dog we are working on it, let the person pass by for a bit, and then go on our way. Reinforce with treats when she sits while they pass."
dogs,feisjyl,t3_epb1ev,1579146111.0,"One of my dogs “jobs” which she takes very seriously is to break up fights between our two cats. We got the cats before we adopted the dog. The cats had screaming matches during the night. It was terrible. One of us had to go out and separate them, it would be anywhere from 11pm to 5 am that this broke out. Now we can tell our dog to take care of it and she does. She busts in the room. One cat she plays with all the time. The other she is terrified of (this cat is about 6lbs lol). Our dog knows she is to break up the fight and come right back to bed. We never taught her that, she just is the peacemaker."
dogs,fecg06z,t3_eofh0c,1578973014.0,My puppy was about 10 weeks when we got her! Had no problems other than usual puppy behavior. She is now curled up by my legs as I type this.
Hair,fe5jsf6,t1_fe5jo81,1578870355.0,It’s a deep conditioner. I just got a new bottle yesterday and I think it was $3 at Target!
dogs,fe08q1h,t1_fe048h9,1578806155.0,Agreed on that point! It was from a guy that had just lost his last dog and wasn’t planning on getting more. I was considering/ looking at it in his garage. I am friends with his daughter. He looked at me and said okay $5 as long as you take it now. I said yes thank you!
dogs,fdzzjta,t3_enfqk7,1578799539.0,"My dogs name is Hart, which is my moms maiden name. I always wanted to name my daughter Hart, if I had one. But I met a boy, fell in love, the last 10+ years are history, and his last name with Hart as a first name does not mesh well lol (it sounds like a strange stripper name.)"
dogs,fdzyenv,t3_enhlvs,1578798836.0,"I went through kind of the same thing. I tried crate training with my puppy. She was good, until she wasn’t. A switch was flipped. She was squishing herself out of a wire crate - without the door being opened - when she was about 30 pounds. I was terrified I was going to come home to her all ripped up or something terrible. We got rid of the wire crate. 

Started leaving her out of the crate. It was fine for a long time. She was good. Then she slowly started chewing up little things - never a ton at a time, just one thing every other day or so. Hairbrush, hair ties, a roll of paper towels, cat toys, an Xbox controller, a few dvds. I am sure I am missing more things. 

Eventually, I couldn’t handle it anymore. She was going to chew up something that really caused her harm or something that was sentimental.  We decided to bust out clam shell plastic crate (I had bought it months before “just in case” we needed a crate for idk what; impulse buy at a garage sale and it was in great condition, $5, and really big.) Put a dog bed in it (that she picked out at the store) and a blanket. She gets her Kong stuffed with wet food and frozen, her dental chew, her lamb chop toy, and sometimes an antler or benebone. I will never go back. She does not hate it at all. She goes in the crate when we ask, she will nap in there if there is too much going on in the house. She “hides” her pigs ear in there on and off. (And yes I know a lot of people say not to have blankets and toys because it can be hazardous with choking or eating it. She likes a toy to knead on, and the blanket just covers the plastic floor. She’s good with her chews - she’s not a huge chewer, just does it once in a while.) 

So happy you found common ground with your pup and the crate too!! I would rather let our dog roam the house, but I really think she gets anxiety and takes it out on chewing up stuff she shouldn’t. She wouldn’t take a second look at the things she targets when we are home, so I am pretty sure it’s some kind of separation anxiety. But she is happy and healthy while in (the new) crate!"

Hair,fdzsr7o,t1_fdzqsbw,1578794925.0,"Not the original commenter, but do not shower without a cap or something to cover your hair until waiting! No product, no heat, no water. Just leave it completely alone as much as you can."
Hair,fdzsefk,t3_eng31i,1578794684.0,"I like adding in Aussie 3 minute miracle instead of my usual conditioner about once per week. It’s not very expensive, and it makes my hair feel SO good! I also add coconut oil onto just the ends of my hair before bed when I think it could use it. Make sure you are using heat protectant if you are blow drying or styling with heat - I can definitely tell when I am not."
dogs,fdmai3q,t3_em2ib4,1578543935.0,"That my girl, despite getting her when she was young, would have her own phobias.  She is out right mean to certain people, even though she is a complete cuddle bug to me and 80% if the people she meets. She also does not care for most children. She was with her mom and siblings for about 12 weeks before we got her from a rescue. I went through the proper channels with it, they checked out my house, I had references, they talked to my vet. I went to the place she was being raised, met the litter, met the mom, met the people that were fostering her - saw their house and fenced in backyard and where she spent her entire life before we got her. Everything was good! 

She just does not like certain people. I do not know what it is. I made sure to socialize her well - we did puppy class and several obedience classes, she has gone in the car EVERYWHERE with my fiancé and I - we literally have a Sunday ritual of going to the hardware store in town (where we are allowed to bring her inside on the leash and she knows she is allowed and is friendly) and then we go grocery shopping (if it is hot out one of us just walks her around town while the other shops). She goes to work with me whenever she can. She goes to daycare. I have taken her to a local outdoor art fair twice a year since I have had her (dogs are allowed). We go to the dog park. We walk on trails with her on the leash.  We have taken her camping in a camper/ on a campground and she is loving to all the people that stop by.  I could go on and on with stuff we have taken her to - and I am very cautious about watching for signs of anxiety or stress in her - I will take us out of the situation if anything comes up. She has met HUNDREDS of people at least. And yet she will single out certain ones to lose her mind at. Barking. Growling. Cowering. We never push it and try to “make her okay with them” but it comes out of nowhere. There is no tell- it’s not like she hates beards or hats or blondes. The kids thing I can understand, I am very cautious with kids and dogs so I never let her roughhouse or anything. But the singling out of people is bizarre. One guy at our vet cannot look in her direction without her losing it. My parents dog is always there with her during daycare, he is much more cautious, and he has no problem with the same person."

dogs,fdizklf,t3_elm8oh,1578454693.0,"Okay I would recommend finding de-ice that is okay for dogs paws! We don’t use regular salt where our dog is going to run - that can damage the paws. 

You can get a balm like mushers secret to put on your pups pads. I have something similar and I just rub it on when her paws feel rough and it helps. 

I have had days where it is SO COLD outside it hurts to have your skin exposed (-degree weather) and I just make sure to you play with my dog inside a lot,  then take her out while on a long lead and tell her to go potty and as soon as she is done she gets a treat inside."
dogs,fdci6w3,t1_fdchqdf,1578275520.0,"Agreed! Just think of it like a doggie vacation too! She will get a week of different smells, cuddles, treats, playing with other dogs!"
dogs,fdci3e9,t1_fdch4lp,1578275451.0,"Oh I have complete faith you can do this then! A lot of animals know when another animal is a baby and tend not to harm them. My parents dog (who used to ignore other dogs) is now put in with the puppies at our daycare place because he is so good with them. He is 90 pounds+, gentle as can be because he now understands they are learning. And your new pup will probably learn the older dogs playing style! 

Sorry about your kitty, I know it’s hard! 

Just work with both of the dogs and watch for signs, you know your older dog so that will be easy to pickup on distress and being uncomfortable. Just mitigate the situation and they will probably work it out just fine!"
dogs,fdch8q9,t1_fdcgh0u,1578274839.0,"I really do understand that! Two weeks after I first got my puppy, I had to leave. My boyfriend was there to take her to our house after work, but she had to stay at my aunts (who is a saint for helping me, but my puppy didn’t know her at all) house during the day (too young to be crated for 9 hours that my boyfriend worked). She was fine when I came back! 

Then I had to leave her when she was about 10 months for a week. I almost cried when I dropped her off because I was worried she would forget me or be sad. I left her with a family friend who I trusted but she hadn’t been at her house before or around her much. She came back more well behaved, better in her crate, and so happy to see me. She was so spoiled while there, I doubt she questioned what I was doing."
dogs,fdcgrv9,t3_ekmeec,1578274512.0,"Nah, don’t feel bad. If the pup fits your house then he fits! You’re going to give him a good life, and there will be plenty of dogs coming up that will need good homes as well! You are first in line to be able to adopt because they trust you. Just let them know it is working out well and would be happy to foster in the future! I really do not think anyone is going to be mad about a dog finding their home! Good luck with everything, I am sure it will work out well!"
dogs,fdcg9jl,t3_ekmfjg,1578274158.0,"Is your older dog good with other dogs generally? 

My parents dog didn’t hate other dogs, but would rather just not be around them. I got a puppy, and she adored him. He hated it. He did not like her, he just tolerated it. We introduced them outside with them on leashes and then moved inside with my puppy still on the leash. It took a little while (I don’t live with my parents) but now they are bffs. You can say the others name and they go bonkers. 

My only advice is take it slow, watch for aggression, feed separately, have different water bowls until they are comfortable (same goes with a few toys and bed/ space for themselves), and just keep a close eye. Make sure you pay attention to your older dog too- it’s hard with a puppy because you have to watch them so close and they are adorable. Try to keep on somewhat of the same schedule."
dogs,fdcftcy,t1_fdccldv,1578273841.0,"Oh I wouldn’t worry then! She will be with your mom and other people she knows. I completely understand your concern though! You could get a pillow and pillowcase and sleep with it until you leave. Have that put in with her while she is boarded. Or a blanket. Or shirt. Anything like that with your scent. If she can go to daycare the days she is boarded even better, she will sleep like a baby and be ready to see you when you get back!"
dogs,fdcbc1q,t3_eklnn1,1578270869.0,"Could you take her to daycare at where you are boarding first or just to meet the people? I would have been so paranoid leaving my dog in boarding,  but now I wouldn’t bat an eye. She goes to daycare about once a week there and LOVES the people that work there. Enough so that she doesn’t care what I am doing as soon as she walks in and sees her friends."
dogs,fcssljg,t3_eiogqr,1577924062.0,"My dogs breath smells sometimes, but not like you’re describing at all. Just like someone who hasn’t brushed their teeth that morning. And she is a dog, so she has not brushed her teeth lol. I give her a dentalife chew every day - it looks like a small-ish brown stick kinda. She loves them, my vet said she has very good dental health.  They also have dentalife ActivFresh which are marketed toward fighting bad breath. I would try some of those. They aren’t super expensive either. I am not sure why you would have to pay for the dogs teeth cleaning?! But, it probably would help."
dogs,fcsrgqu,t3_eipd15,1577923239.0,"Adaptil might be something to look into! It’s not a drug you give your dog, it’s more of a scent that is released for comfort and calming. You can get them in collars and maybe wipes. I know my vet uses them for dogs that are uncomfortable during exams and shots. They have something similar for cats - definitely helps my cats on car trips and to the vet."

dogs,fcikg71,t3_ehct1z,1577664058.0,"Find one of the dogs that your dog has warmed up to. Set up play dates. I did this with my dog because she was OBNOXIOUS at her puppy class - but she bonded with a few dogs that have the same play style as her. I had nothing in common with the other dogs owners, but I did it because she loved it. We also went on walks together and just let them hang out when we could."
dogs,fcik453,t3_ehd6x5,1577663888.0,"Doggy daycare is really great (usually anyway, mine is!) Dog walker or someone to let your dog out during the day while you are gone. Neighbor, friend, family member, kid that lives down the street, even a college kid (I ALWAYS wanted those kind of gigs when I was in college, I couldn’t have my own dog, get $10 to walk and hangout with a dog - yes please!!) 

Things to keep your dog interested during the day. I have an antler for my dog to chew on, freeze wet dog food or canned pumpkin in a long, and use different puzzle toys."

Gifts,fc4hvln,t3_efptge,1577417118.0,"I was going through a rough year a while (over 10 years) back. My grandma bought a jar with a top, and put in pieces of paper that she cut with a little kid scissors (the ones with the wavy lines/ jagged line, other design) and wrote on them things she loves about me or happy memories of us together. She put a note on the top to pull out a piece of paper whenever I needed something - if I was feeling down, feeling lonely, feeling happy and wanted more happy, or anything else. 

I have seen a variation of that where there are envelopes with notes inside. The outside of the envelope say things like; open when you’re sad, open when you need validation, open when you’re happy, any anything else. 

Or, a mason jar with sticks (popsicle sticks maybe) that have date ideas on them. When you’re not sure what to do, pick a stick! You could come up with some cute ideas that cost nothing/ very little and put them on the sticks."
