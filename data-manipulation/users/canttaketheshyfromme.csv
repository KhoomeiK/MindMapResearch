Both physically and mentally, because Schobert's been in the position of commanding pre-snap adjustments for the defense.

Comp picks are *additional* picks given to soften the blow of losing a star player to free agency. Schobert is I believe the only player currently on the roster who might result in a 2021 comp pick if we don't re-sign him. Holding on to Vernon through the 2020 season and then letting him walk may result in a 2022 comp pick.

>In order to qualify for the comp equation, a player must have been a true Unrestricted Free Agent whose contract had expired or was voided after the previous season (i.e., he cannot have been released by his old team); he must sign during the UFA signing period (which ended July 27 last year); if he signs after June 1[*], he must have been tendered a June 1 qualifying offer by his old team; his compensatory value or contract value must be above a specific minimum amount; and he cannot have been permanently released by his new team before a certain point in the season (which seems to be after Week 10) or, possibly, before getting a certain amount of playing time, unless he was claimed off waivers by another team."

Worth pointing out that those 2016-2017 rosters had no excuse for going 1-31 other than *Hue Jackson's worthless ass.* That front office that Berry was part of had to sabotage a fax machine **so Hue couldn't push through a deadline trade that would have given a 2nd and 3rd for a half-season rental on AJ McCarron.**

I don't think Sashi Brown was the second coming but you don't have to look any deeper than Hue Jackson for why those were the worst pro football teams ever fielded. John Dorsey is a great scout, but his 2018 draft was built on a pile of picks Sashi and his guys (including Berry) had amassed by stripping down the roster."

Browns,ffqsfbt,t1_ffqrntn,1580142575.0,"So a lot of professional mocks have the Giants reaching for Becton at #4 and that throws off all the old math about OT availability and pretty much guarantees that one of Thomas, Wirfs or Wills is available for us at #10 if that happens. Current hype has Wills or Thomas going in the top 6. I think at #10 we likely only have one of Thomas/Wirfs/Wills available, but that's all we need. Thomas and Wirfs will both be anchor tackles from Week 1 2020 and for years to come. Wills is also there but needs to get his penalties under control.

Jackson is probably the best option in the 2nd round if he falls there but you've also got Prince Tega Wanogho and Josh Jones who are both pretty raw but have the physical traits of a starting LT.

It's worth considering that Wills has played almost exclusively RT while Thomas and Wirfs can play either side capably. The rest would all need to learn RT as a new position if they had to play that side, with the exception of Lucas Niang."
Browns,ffqqrhb,t1_ffqpw2a,1580141462.0,"Absolute physical freak, but my #1 worry is that he pushes off instead of locking up when he blocks. Faster, more flexible NFL edge rushers are going to take that initial push, bend under and come around his left side at the QB. He'll move his man in the run game but can get stood up which makes him less effective. And his situational awareness isn't great, not a guy who looks for a second opportunity to contribute on a play. I'd say late 1st round, not the #4 pick like some have him now."

Lawrence could use some development work when it comes to hitting narrow gaps, but he's got all the tools to be a very strong interior rusher. I figure one year rotating with Ogunjobi and Richardson before he likely displaces Ogunjobi who's in the last year of his rookie contract in 2020.

Highsmith has good athleticism and showed the flexibility to play as either a 4-3 DE or a true 3-4 OLB when tasked with coverage duties in zone blitzes. NFL strength training will hopefully take away some of his limitations in shedding blockers. Best-case, he excels and lets us get Vernon off the books... worst-case, he's versatile depth at EDGE, a place we have only one depth player worth a damn (Thomas).
