financialindependence,ffr617y,t3_eul1mo,1580151224.0,"Looking at refinancing my mortgage. I've got a good deal I'm probably going to do. The loan estimate came in with the numbers the loan person was telling me, but they rolled it all in to the loan.  Does that make sense to do? I'm basically taking some equity out and I'd take that and would put it in the market. But then I'm pushing out my pay off a bit. I guess I wouldn't take out a mortgage to invest it, so why should I do this?"
njbeer,ffr4pqv,t1_ffqzupi,1580150405.0,Didn't realize there is an upper bar. Is it the same taps upstairs? That is an indoor or outdoor space?
njbeer,ffqwq6m,t1_ffqvncv,1580145372.0,Pre launch party. There were only a few high top tables for standing around and barstools at the bar when I went. Are there regular tables now?
