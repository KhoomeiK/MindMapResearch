slavelabour,ffbjm7r,t1_ffbff5b,1579768398.0,Sounds good!
Needafriend,ffbffo7,t3_esfkpu,1579762945.0,"This was amazing! I'd love to chat, 22F here. Fair warning though, I'm very awkward in the beginning. But I think we can find something fun to talk about."
slavelabour,ffbdcsj,t3_esl8j9,1579760559.0,What does a bundle include?
Art,ff87ad6,t1_ff86vlg,1579668027.0,"Oh, I'll definitely try that. Thank you! I didn't know about scumbling. I tried doing a black and white painting for the same reason but I didn't succeed the first time. I'll have to try again and aim for better results."
lonely,ff86n55,t3_es5iv4,1579667483.0,"I do that. Sometimes, I think up fantastical scenarios where I can escape from reality or just think what I can do in the future. Or something simple too like when I see someone interesting, I think and wonder what it'd be like to talk to them, have a conversation, etc. And I make one up."
Art,ff84iyc,t1_ff83yen,1579665787.0,Thanks! Is it a common practice? I didn't want to be one of those beginners who just get fancy accessories to try and make things easier for me without taking time to learn. I was wondering if everyone uses it or is there a way to deal with drying without using the medium. Sort of also as a learning process?
depression,ff82l00,t3_eruu6o,1579664327.0,I'm sorry you had to go through that. Finding understanding friends when you suffer from depression is hard. I've been through similar situations and it sucks every time.
unpopularopinion,ff7zig3,t3_erx2x0,1579662100.0,"I think this is mostly because most users who do that are quite possibly Christians or maybe come from such a background? It's better and easier to dunk on something you're familiar with rather than something you've no idea about or may not be that aware of all the intricacies.

Tbh, I'd rather talk shit about my own religion than someone else's. I haven't gone through their struggles and they haven't gone through mine. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I have any right to say anything about someone else's religion. Terrorists and intolerant governments and practices are a different thing of course. And such things motivated by religion should of course be questioned by everyone regardless of their faith. But yeah, I wouldn't go as far as to start attacking an entire religion because of that.

I am legally a Hindu and I bitch out my religion every chance I get, I hate it. I also bitch out the governments using Islam to cause terror just as much as I bitch out governments doing the same with Hinduism. But I don't talk about Islam because I don't know about it and I am more qualified to be speaking about Hinduism.

Idk if I put my point across well enough, but yeah."

blursedimages,fesxla4,t3_eqc717,1579369961.0,I don't understand what's blursed about this. This is straight up blessed.
depression,fesvl8b,t3_eqg0dk,1579369464.0,"I know exactly what you mean. My ""friends"" would tell me that they're here for me and then leave me on read when I'd reach out and later act like nothing happened when we'd meet in person. Actively exclude me and then gaslight me when I tried to call them out or express my feelings of hurt. Fuck everyone man, just fuck everyone.

These people are only there for you when it's convenient for them. Which is almost never."
blursedimages,fesshy6,t3_eqfnbh,1579368566.0,How is this blursed? It's really good design.
AmItheAsshole,feg7yxb,t3_eoo84b,1579081344.0,That is incredibly messed up! NTA! What your mum did was terrible you sound defying stay away.
introvert,fec88sv,t3_eo4my6,1578968365.0,"Yes. Even my friends consider me as less intelligent. I don't exactly know why but I'll attribute it to me not speaking much and not being confident. My friends are the argumentative and opinionated types and sometimes when I disagree with them, they just attack me with their arguments so I just quiet down. I've noticed when I ask something I don't know they have a look on their face that very obviously implies that they think I'm stupid. Even if it's something which I'd assume is very simple.

Other than them, people only realise that I have substance when they happen to work with me. Or when it comes to teachers, if they happen to teach a subject I'm very interested in and I show them my work or present something, they also comment that they didn't expect it from me. And are surprised."
AmItheAsshole,fec6q5i,t3_eo6j73,1578967583.0,"NAH. Unpopular opinion but yeah. It's normal to feel that way and it is understandable. OP is not forbidding her daughter from meeting her birth mother. 

What OP should do is try to come around her feelings and give this thing a chance. Being apprehensive is just going to push your daughter away from you even more. Consider going with her if not for yourself, for your daughter. She needs your support the most right now and you should be there for her. This way you can also keep your presence constant and see how their interactions go and maybe your apprehensions will also melt away over time."
depression,fe8hr3x,t3_enrs4c,1578926287.0,YES! I feel like I'm making things about myself and am just trying to create clout. I always refrain from talking about myself. I get very self conscious.
depression,fdqoxhe,t3_emqv0o,1578671720.0,I stop being suicidal every once in a while. These periods coincide with times when I have something important to distract me or there is someone who needs my help and their predicament is more important than my internal issues. This also happens at times when I just get very numb where I kind of don't feel anything and just go about life on auto pilot.
depression,fdqolz2,t3_emr0ko,1578671522.0,I'm going through something similar so I can relate. I wish I could help but even I don't know why people do it. It's just sucky in general and I wish I could fix it.
depression,fdqogdk,t3_empzok,1578671422.0,Hah. Me. People tell me I have two resting faces. One where I look immensely depressed. The other where I look like I'm ready to rip everyone in front of me to pieces.
AskReddit,fdqnnqk,t3_emqd57,1578670925.0,"Levi's. Their jeans just work best for me. 
Also this brand Carmesi for pads. They make biodegradable pads which feel amazing"
unpopularopinion,fdmy1z8,t1_fdmmrwt,1578570876.0,Somebody make this subreddit please.
CasualConversation,fdir2qv,t1_fdipujp,1578449141.0,"Aye, that's really good news. Maybe you two were just missing each other and it reflected in your dream. Haha."
CasualConversation,fdiqywa,t1_fdipyzj,1578449071.0,"Haha. I tend to spoil dogs so I'll have to be careful. I had a pet dog when I was younger and he was a spoilt brat. But more in a fun and cute way. He was a very sweet kid. 

I hope I get to have a lot of dogs in the future. I want to open a stray shelter once I'm rich enough to do so."
CasualConversation,fdipc6m,t1_fdip7fl,1578448025.0,"Ahh, I know how that be. It'll be okay op. (: Maybe you can hit up your grandma and meet her."
CasualConversation,fdiomg8,t3_elkrfx,1578447566.0,Pip sounds good.
CasualConversation,fdioj8t,t1_fdio2ma,1578447510.0,Thank you. (: Meeting cute dogs around town is literally something I look forward to everyday. They really help improve my mood and I like giving them some love and food. I love it when they recognise me and run up to me. So sweet.
CasualConversation,fdio5tf,t3_elldef,1578447272.0,"That sounds intense. ): At least your grandma was ok at the end of the dream. Perhaps the crying was brought about by something else in your life. Also, sometimes you just want to cry one out to feel better and it's nice to have someone you love to support you at those times."
unpopularopinion,fdccv9p,t3_ekf1ch,1578271825.0,I love eggs but they also totally fuck up my stomach for days on end. It's a real shame.
