I think future archaeologists and anthropologists would be fascinated to consider the remnants of a society where a significant proportion of the population (based on preserved evidence, anyway) decided to fuck with the future, at least with funny hoaxing. (Fucking the future so badly that the climate fails would be less fascinating.)"

(Butler was the voice of [Wally Gator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Gator), [Yogi Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Bear), [Hokey Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokey_Wolf), [Elroy Jetson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elroy_Jetson), [Quick Draw McGraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Draw_McGraw), [Snagglepuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snagglepuss), and [Huckleberry Hound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huckleberry_Hound).)
