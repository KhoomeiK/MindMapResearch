*He did not take it well at all.*

He freaked, got mad, sent me pictures of him cutting himself and posted videos of burning stuff of mine that he had and a letter he wrote to me. He also felt it necessary to tell me he was drunk driving a lot because of me.

I've known 3 INTJs very closely over the course of my life, and one of them was definitely **insanely** insecure over being unachieved in life despite being quite intelligent. He was so angry about it he basically raged about it every other day and projected these insecurities onto me. 

My brother, another INTJ, does not have any *obvious* insecurities at all, but he struggles with emotional availability, and can't really handle having to comfort someone or so, which he often overcompensates by being judgemental over for example me having an irrational breakdown."
