I had 2 bassets and I am not trying to be funny or anything, but you might think he is more depressed than he is, because they love to be lazy and of course, they just look sad. Taking him out for walks will help to interest him too, but you know with bassets, walking 2 blocks can take 1/2 hour because they need to sniff everything. Of course, treats like cheese are always going to make him happy, but make him work for them a bit. When he gets it, he will be so pleased with himself. Keeping him moderately busy should alleviate his depression, but he needs to adjust to his new situation.

The servicer basically ignores what is going on since they already sent this on to their legal department, who has sent it to the attorney. Then the attorneys, unknowing that there is in fact no true history of nonpayment, files a complaint and under the contract, the borrower must pay litigation fees. The worst is when they finally dismiss the complaint and try to stick the  borrower with the whole bill for legal fees and costs."

talesfromcallcenters,fe4imk3,t3_enpvq9,1578859718.0,"I did mortgage foreclosures that were being contested. We had one where it sounded like an old, old lady's daughter pretty much forced her to take out a loan on her house that was already paid for and the money disappeared up the daughter's nose. The judge gave her an extension of time to answer the complaint, and I went to my client and told them that if this old lady lost her house, it would result in terrible publicity (the client was advertising its services for financial management and targeting seniors), and would poison any case that came before that judge. The client was able to work something out with the elderly lady that allowed her to stay in the house and pay rent and evicted her daughter. Based upon other cases though, daughter moved into the house once the lady died and hid it from the mortgagee. They told me they would be checking up and I assume they did."
