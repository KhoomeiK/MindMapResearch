Showerthoughts,fghmwiw,t3_eyb8gu,1580788498.0,"We would have different factions of people depending on the kind of horns you had. What is your animal affiliate? Do you have bull horns or bison? 

> [Antlers are grown by males of the Cervidae](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/antlers-or-horns-whats-the-difference) family, which includes all species of deer, moose, and elk. They appear only on males, with the exception of caribou, and that's because they're used by males to compete with other males for mating rights with females. They are grown every spring and shed every winter. That's why a male sporting a big rack is really impressive: it takes a lot of energy to grow antlers, so being able to invest energy in large antlers while still staying healthy enough to compete shows females that this is a male with great genes. 

Do you have antlers or horns? 

> [Horns, on the other hand, are found on members of the Bovidae family](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/antlers-or-horns-whats-the-difference), which includes species as diverse as cows, sheep and goats to water buffalo, antelopes, and gazelles. Horns can appear on both males and females depending on the species, and the size and shape of horns vary wildly from species to species. Unlike antlers, horns are never branched, are never shed (with one notable exception), and in many species horns never stop growing throughout an animal's life. 

Would people stick to their 'own kinds'? Think of the clubs and groups that would form. ....think of the product marketing that would emerge.

Edit: We've had a very in-depth family discussion about tails before, a similar idea."
