Yea the war bankrupted Britain but wars tend to do that, especially one on that scale. I would say the loss of the empire was more of an after effect. The only parts of the empire that really lost because of the war was Malaysia, Burma and Singapore. The lost of the empire was more to the fact the people wanted self determination and the anti-empire attitude of the UN. Wanting independence for all colonies"
