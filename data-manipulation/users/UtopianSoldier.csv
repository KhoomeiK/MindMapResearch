> The issue is disinterest of people in having a long term stable career

What's wrong with that? I don't want a long term stable career either. I want to grow but not so interested in stability at this point. And those people who want long term stable career don't choose startups. They go for big names.

I think if you are too small, you can look for a co-founder that can handle a specific department. You can also offer equities to employees but still I feel, you will be disappointed if you look for employees with vision like you. They are rare.

You probably have more experience in hiring than me. But that's how I feel."
