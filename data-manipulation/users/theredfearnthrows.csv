bulletjournal,fesq23w,t1_fesmko0,1579367827.0,Thanks!
bulletjournal,fesnnrb,t1_fesbvj0,1579367166.0,I did! Just got a giant set of prisma color on holiday sale. Using lots of restraint not to use all of them!
bulletjournal,fe8pu18,t3_eo2l8y,1578929091.0,"Awesome! 

Pro Tip: on your last copy, use a yellow highlighter to write ""original,"" the yellow highlighter will not photocopy so you won't accidentally use your last blank copy.

 Alternately, you can scan it in and save a pdf digitally, but that highlighter trick is good to know.

bulletjournal,fe0a2y9,t1_fdzvqls,1578807385.0,thats it! it will look like garbage for a while and then slowly it won't! I also like to focus in on one letter at a time and fill the whole page. There are also stroke drills to do.
bulletjournal,fe0a09q,t1_fdzq7ne,1578807317.0,"not really, this is for keeping note of big important dates that are further ahead than the current month- i.e. birthdays, travel days, holidays, people visiting. My one from last year had at max about 6 entries. Otherwise the information is housed in the monthly overview or weekly spread (regular appointments, volunteer days, dr appointment scheduled for that month, etc.)"
bulletjournal,fdyo52x,t1_fdwyhqx,1578781834.0,"Its really about focusing on a tool set and practicing. First get to know letter forms with faux-ligraphy and using a pencil. Then decide if you are more interested in small brush, large brush, or pointed pen- then start practicing! I also write most words first in soft pencil then go over with caligraphy tools."
bulletjournal,fdxv6ak,t1_fdx412o,1578773245.0,Wow! Thanks!

Charlotte,fdgn89m,t1_fdgfxs6,1578402939.0,As a teacher I tried to convince my principal to Lysol the children every morning. This suggestion was declined. Alas.
Charlotte,fdgn234,t3_ekwsfq,1578402786.0,"I'm sure other places have much easier DMV's, but coming here from Brooklyn where there are easy about 200+ people in a cattle call and wait times are closer to 4+ hours my 30 min wait to transfer DL here was a breeze. 

In Texas and Louisiana we always just went to the closest small town or farthest from center of town office. Perhaps that would work here as well?"

bulletjournal,fdgmm0y,t1_fdfhrh5,1578402383.0,"That was where the category was the last time I did a Level 10 self-eval. For me that would have been back in March, I try to do them every 3-6 months and this is an easy way to tell if I'm growing, staying stable, or declining in my goals."
bulletjournal,fcr9saz,t3_eijai6,1577898846.0,I'm actually getting physically angry over this- even though I've not even made my spread for this week. Lol- skipping weeks is ok if it is my own lazy fault!

RedditLaqueristas,fcn70tl,t3_ehl0tg,1577804931.0,"Thinking about getting a DIY dip powder system- can you mix powders from one brand and the liquids from another? i.e. if I get the Dipwell kit, could I get a Revel or Kiara Sky color powder to use with it?"
