AmItheAsshole,ffdndnj,t1_ffd9v2o,1579824568.0,"She insists that all those teenagers and grown people share beds while there’s an easy way to arrange differently and those people are telling her those ways. Kids are not happy with the old arrangement as they grow. Normally mother would be happy there’s a solution for an awkward situation but in this case she holds on to the old arrangement like it’s the most important part of the whole trip. Family time together can be when everyone is awake, sharing meals, going sightseeing, enjoying beach, whatever there is at the destination, not by throwing all in a puppy pile. So there’s some kind of shortcut in her head that makes her want things to be this way. Trip as an excuse to get everyone sleeping together and girlfriend in a separate room if she has to come along at all. Doesn’t make sense financially as they still pay for the same number of rooms. There’s bunch of different solutions how to ensure that each gets their own bed during the trip: shorter stay, cheaper hotel, hostel room, even one with bunk beds if money is tight, or choose another destination. She clings to this one. There’s a reason for everything anyone does, sometimes simply that they don’t see another way but here the kids have presented another more satisfying solution so why does she want the old arrangement so badly? Why did this even start like it is now? Normally when you plan a family trip you start with the number of people = number of beds. Then budget for affordable hotel. Hotels offer baby cots, there is no need to share a bed even with the toddler. Look at any booking site, first thing you select is number of people. Not number of people:2= number of beds. Why is it so important to keep? Just allow people do as they want, it shouldn’t be such a big deal. Unless she gets some kicks out of this. Maybe this is something she needs therapy for."

This means you are free to keep it forever even if you divorce or the other person dies. AND it means you can let it go. It's all yours. Not theirs although it sounds/reads exactly like their names do. Do as you feel like. Nobody else has any say. And if they want to have any kind of relationship with you (to share memories or something) they better be polite.

Hey, he shouldn't be the one allowed to make them. He clearly loves his mom more than his wife, so maybe he goes to live in her basement? And leaves the husband vacancy for somebody worthy.
