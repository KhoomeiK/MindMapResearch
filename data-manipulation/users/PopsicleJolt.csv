AskReddit,ffabqsa,t1_ff951zq,1579731801.0,"I'm scared that even if I do say anything more serious than ""try watching cartoons at some point"", then my younger self won't want to hear it. She was experiencing really bad depression at the time, and I would know that teenagers and depression are not a good combination. (Heck, she might not even listen to that above point because she probably would think that cartoons are for small children.)

However, telling her that she is indeed gay would prompt a delightfully confused reaction that I want to watch just for the laughs. ""What do you mean, I'm gay? I just haven't found the right guy yet!"""
