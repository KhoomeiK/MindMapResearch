YangForPresidentHQ,ffiau8f,t3_etr9zb,1579969461.0,What poll shows him in 4th place?
YangForPresidentHQ,ffeexct,t1_ffedj8d,1579845435.0,"I like Yang's proposals and integrity, but I'm not going to vote how he wants anymore than Sanders wanted me to vote for Hillary in 2016. If Yang doesn't win the primary, there isn't a single other candidate I can see myself supporting.

That's the big thing about Yang. He draws in people the Democrats need in order to beat Trump. If Yang loses, the Democrats most likely lose."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffeeoh3,t1_ffe7fnr,1579845185.0,"I think you're missing what this stat is saying. A lot of us are here for Yang, and don't care if Trump wins again. It's Yang or bust. I would love to see Trump voted out of office, but I'll take his ridiculous tweets over some of the insane policy proposals the other candidates are proposing any day. If Yang loses, I vote third party... Again."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffeeey5,t1_ffeax88,1579844921.0,"I won't vote for him because he wants to forgive student debt. Lessen the interest rates, but don't just whipe the slate clean. If I'd known it was going to be free I would not have dropped out and paid off what I owed."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffee5oa,t1_ffdyqsa,1579844666.0,Yup. I am one of those people.

todayilearned,ff93sw6,t1_ff92byv,1579704159.0,I heard back in the day it was normal for military commanders to have breakfast together and chat before a fight. Because they had more in common with one another than they did with the peasants fighting for them.
YangForPresidentHQ,ff83n05,t1_ff81cya,1579665110.0,"That is the single most policy that keeps me from voting for him. Fuck me for being responsible, right?"
YangForPresidentHQ,ff5ajlz,t1_ff4z1ze,1579585281.0,And raising minimum wage will do the opposite.
YangForPresidentHQ,ff5ac7y,t1_ff51mqd,1579585084.0,"God, the whole college tuition forgiveness thing drives me nuts. I dropped out because I couldn't afford it. I did the responsible thing and decided not to take out a loan because I knew it was expensive. Now all of my friends are going to have a degree on top of the 50k or so the government is giving them. Not having a degree is hard enough but now they're just slapping me in the face."
history,ff26kvz,t1_ff1z0is,1579495256.0,Because China is so populated they don't really value life the way we do here in the west.
YangForPresidentHQ,fewbidk,t1_fetkm82,1579407971.0,Almost definitely not.
whitepeoplegifs,fes55fr,t1_ferf8xo,1579361481.0,I don't see her point. Maybe they picked out that sweatshirt from a pile of stuff but the only reason I'm wearing it is because it was the cheapest outfit at Walmart.
YangForPresidentHQ,fep8tmr,t1_fenyqnb,1579314715.0,That's Bernie. Yang's policies are revolutionary.
YangForPresidentHQ,fep8pn0,t1_femz9ic,1579314643.0,"Alright let's not bring racism into this from either side. Plenty of ""privileged whites"" like Yang."
YangForPresidentHQ,feoowqw,t1_feobuzv,1579303293.0,Of course Trump supporters will support Biden over Bernie. Why is that weird to you?
YangForPresidentHQ,feo24x4,t1_fencpja,1579294130.0,"And both are true. I'm a Yang supporter, but you're naive if you think otherwise."
therewasanattempt,femuy46,t3_epv6c5,1579270289.0,There's a huge difference.
BlackPeopleTwitter,femuknt,t1_femo58o,1579270004.0,Look how defensive you are getting because you would rather dwell in your issues rather than solve them. He gave you great advice and you got offended. That says a lot about you.
BlackPeopleTwitter,femugq1,t1_femo39o,1579269918.0,Don't you have something more important you should be doing right now?
BlackPeopleTwitter,femu6th,t1_femoihx,1579269700.0,You did choose all of that. Boo fucking hoo.

BlackPeopleTwitter,femtzik,t1_femmt40,1579269541.0,"But life is simple. Being an adult *is* easy. Your life choices are difficult, but me and all of my friends are in our 30s and our hardest decision is getting a day off of work to go mountain biking."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femtp88,t1_femnw07,1579269314.0,"What I find hilarious is how they don't understand that they made choices. They are in this thread right now saying ""So you're telling me just don't own house plants, don't buy a new car, don't have kids? Be real."" They can't comprehend that those things are optional. I feel sorry for them tbh."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femt95c,t1_femp9d9,1579268960.0,"Yes, basically. Or do those things and don't complain about choosing to do them. I choose not to do most of things things and guess what, my life is great. You act like someone is holding a gun to your head."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femt115,t1_femqn4a,1579268777.0,"Yeah this person just wants to complain and play the ""who is more stressed out"" game."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femst4e,t1_femir4y,1579268596.0,"First two are done automatically online, I will never have kids for the reasons you just listed, I don't have disabled parents, meal planning saves you time because it only takes one day and the rest of the week all you need to do is eat it, cats going to the vet is like a once every 2 year occasion, idk what weddj g vegetable beds means but I just buy my veggies at the grocery store, if you don't get into legal trouble meetings with a lawyer will only be precautionary and therefore rare. Work I will give you. 40 hour work weeks need to go away. The rest, it sounds like you are prioritizing and stressing about things that don't need it."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femsj0v,t1_femnu3u,1579268371.0,I'm really having a hard time how a comment about looking forward to dying is something someone needed to hear today. This website is dramatic af.
BlackPeopleTwitter,femsagl,t1_femm0id,1579268175.0,"Capitalism gives you something optional to work towards. If you want to spend your free time on your hobbies and only work to live, that's more than possible. The real problem with capitalism is how bad people are with their money."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femriss,t1_femm73g,1579267534.0,A relationship? Really cool. Marriage? Too much of a good thing.
Pete_Buttigieg,fem4o1p,t1_felnurn,1579239637.0,What about Yang?
facepalm,fem0d1l,t1_feku7ti,1579235724.0,I'm absolutely facepalming at him.
facepalm,fem08nv,t1_feliq6v,1579235623.0,No one forced him to do anything.
facepalm,fem04ju,t1_felslpa,1579235528.0,It's very consistent. At 18 he could take out a loan and get a tattoo. Would you prefer us wait until he's 30? jfc.
YangForPresidentHQ,felxijn,t1_felv5aw,1579233436.0,"As a left-leaning moderate, I would NEVER vote for Bernie. Yang is the only dem candidate I will vote for. Otherwise I'm going 3rd party again."
YangForPresidentHQ,felxalw,t1_felcr5a,1579233272.0,"Yeah that's where I'm at. I chose not to go to college because the loans were ridiculous. Now my friends all have better paying jobs than me, and the government is going to pay off their debt on top of that? Their quality of life me income is already better than mine. Don't make the gap even larger. For sure, make college cheaper. But don't just forgive all loans."
worldnews,felkawo,t1_felfdda,1579224222.0,I think people on this website want the world to burn. Just like how everyone on here is depressed. They don't want good news. They relish in the misery. It's weird.
worldnews,felk4tq,t1_fekxi3m,1579224105.0,Just like how every prediction for climate change ends up being wrong. My uncle's home in Florida is supposed to be under water right now.

todayilearned,fe6gbvp,t1_fe68dby,1578890043.0,It doesn't matter *why* they're doing it. They're an asshole no matter what the reason is. There is absolutely no excuse for it. None.

worldnews,fdw565t,t1_fdv7mli,1578755196.0,Meh. The US having nukes first made the world the safest it has ever been in history. Any other nation would have continued to use them after WW2.

worldnews,fdw2baa,t1_fdtq9sj,1578754273.0,Which was the right move. The attack was in response to Iran attacking a US embassy. I don't think people here realize how big of a deal that is.
worldnews,fdw21ug,t1_fduml33,1578754199.0,Yes actually. They've been attacking the US and it's allies all through 2019 and 2018. Lord knows what they would do if they were capable of a real war. The only thing holding them back is that they know they're unmatched. Having nukes would change that.

This was 3 years ago. And now here he is attacking an American embassy taking American lives. With more plans of attacks like these in the future. 

Any media organization in the know would understand that he is the target, because the CIA warned him so. This isn't some grand conspiracy. I think a lot of redditors here don't realize that this attack was in response to an attack on American soil. The US aren't the aggressors in this situation. They had to respond."
