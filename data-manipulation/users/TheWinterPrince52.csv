ShovelKnight,ffklrcu,t3_env2lf,1580024851.0,"(SPOILER ALERT FOR SHOVEL OF HOPE)

My theory: Polar Knight is the father of Shield Knight.  They both have a mole on their face and a viking theme (Shield Knight's helmet resembles the valkyrie, as somebody else pointed out in another comment).  Polar Knight deeply cares about his daughter, and since she and Shovel Knight were adventuring partners and eventual lovers, Polar Knight and Shovel Knight formed a deep respect for each other (also both wield shovels).  When Shield Knight became The Enchantress, Polar Knight eventually found out and was of course heartbroken at the corruption of his daughter and the apparent giving up of Shovel Knight.  In order to remain close to his daughter and try to keep her safe or save her, he joined her Order of No Quarter.  When Shovel Knight made a return, he was both duty-bound as a father and member of the Order to protect the Enchantress.  However, he also may have held some ire toward Shovel Knight for giving up for so long and daring to challenge his daughter upon his return, and for both these reasons, he challenged Shovel Knight.  Once Shield Knight is saved, he goes back to his old ways of being a proud warrior and raising spinwulves."
ShovelKnight,ffkirj6,t3_eqj6vd,1580023444.0,"Trench Knight.

Main color: dark blue.  Wears a trenchcoat, has a flat-ish helmet resembling that of american/british soldiers in WW1 but with a facemask like Specter Knight's, wields a trenching shovel with swings and stabs.  Physical build is somewhat on the thin side, much like Mr. Hat.

Is capable of rearranging an earthen battlefield on sudden notice to suit his needs, such as digging up a wall in front of himself to block attacks or give himself something to stand on, basically like a combination of Mole Knight and Polar Knight but it only works on the floor.

Special Skill: Trench Dig.  Stabs his trenching shovel into the ground and yanks it mightily, digging out a trench in the ground with that one move.  This can either affect the battlefield, create a shockwave of dirt, or both.  He has some connection to rain (maybe he gains a small power boost or the rain helps him perform his trench dig move).  Has a long reach with certain attacks due to the long blade of his trench-oriented shovel.

Personality-wise, he is a very smart and wise warrior who usually remains as an observer of the world around him, but sometimes enjoys dueling other knights or challenging their goals and methods with logic.  Absolutely despises blind stupidity/stubbornness (he would definitely have a bone to pick with King Knight if King Knight shows no remorse for siding with the Enchantress).  Has a soft spot in his heart for eccentric personalities.  Has an ongoing friendly rivalry with the Phantom Striker, since their elemental affinities and skills are almost polar opposites and their personalities are similar.  Enjoys games, collecting things and hunting for treasure.  Also really enjoys Joustus, and is fairly skilled at it.

Joustus ability: ""Play by the Rules!""  Cheats cannot be used against him in a Joustus match, nor will he use any cheats himself.  Anyone who tries will be slapped and/or forfeit the match.  However, anyone who can beat him three times in a row earns his respect as the better Joustus player.  This does not mean he will respect anything else about them though, just their Joustus skills.

Friendships: Phantom Striker, Plague Knight, Mona, Shield Knight, Black Knight, Percy, Baz Knight, Goldarmor, King Pridemoor, Polar Knight, Propeller Knight, Cooper and co., Mr. Hat, Troupple King, Troupple Acolytes, Bard, Gouche, Reize, Oolong.

Rivals: Phantom Striker, all shovel-wielders, Propeller Knight (when on the ground), Mole Knight, Plague Knight, King Pridemoor.

Enemies: The Enchantress, Corrupt Reize, Traitorous, King Knight (for now at least), Specter Knight, Treasure Knight.

Fun Fact: He is actually seen without his helmet far more often than many of the other knights.  It's common knowledge that he is fairly young, no older than 25 but looking more like a teenager to most.  His hair is short, well-combed, and dirty blond in color.  Despite his association with muddy trenches and bad weather, he keeps himself and his things nice and clean as much as he can.  He has a particular fondness for his trenchcoat and his waterproof boots.

I have my own idea for an exotic weapon.  As much as I don't like power snipers, this one is one.  It is called Bloodhunter.  It is slow to equip because it's huge, but it fires fast, hits hard (power ammo), and its exotic perk adds increased aim-assist, so you'll score a headshot as long as the enemy's head is within a shotgun-like circle (maybe not that wide though, but idunno).
