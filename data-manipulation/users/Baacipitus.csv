BreakUps,ffcafxm,t1_ffby23o,1579795193.0,Likewise. Take care of yourself. It’s gonna be rough for us both but I hope that you make it through and still are able to find happiness in this life.
BreakUps,ffb5zrv,t3_esl3kk,1579752707.0,"I wish you the best. Whatever you decide upon doing after, please take care of yourself and make sure you’re staying as healthy as you can OP."
BreakUps,ffb5ovm,t3_esf0or,1579752475.0,"I feel this. My ex just left me yesterday and the waves have been crashing down constantly. I love and miss her so much, and I just want to hold her again as if it was the beginning of the year once more."
depression,ff6q7yx,t3_eruu6o,1579632600.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. As hard to hear as this may be, that’s not someone that you need in your life. You need friends who are willing to be there for you as you are for them. It’s a two-way street. I hope things get better, OP."
depression,ff6hm0m,t1_ff6al7g,1579627380.0,"I believe that it did. It’s not gonna be the life saver, it’s what you put into it that truly affects how it works out for you. If you stay with it and have a good therapist, then it can do great things for you. I wish you the best on this journey, and know that you are cherished by many."
depression,ff4taj5,t3_erhrrj,1579571925.0,"I’m proud of you for taking this step, OP. I had to go to therapy a year ago for some things going on and I’m thinking that I may have to go back. It’s not an easy process but I wish you the best."
depression,ff4t2u7,t3_ermt16,1579571780.0,Exactly how I’ve been this entire weekend. I’ve had a string of some really bad days this entire weekend and I’ve been talking about it with my mom and my friends. I can’t help but think that I’m annoying them or exploiting their compassion in order to try to make me feel better. I hate myself for it.
depression,ff4swoh,t3_ererwo,1579571664.0,"This has been exactly my feelings these past few years. I know I have it lucky all things considered, but I can’t help but get down like this sometimes. I hope that you stay strong, friend."
reddeadredemption2,fegxoyx,t1_fe93qrk,1579104848.0,I’ve literally been trying to play Gears of War 5 and watch a new anime in order to get over it. It’s only halfway working.
reddeadredemption2,fe81f8s,t1_fe6xw6w,1578921327.0,"I agree. It was a curse and a blessing almost when he contracted TB after nearly beating that man to death for Strauss (I kicked that bastard out, he’s scummy as hell). The writing of how Arthur found peace and how it connected to other lines from the game is art at its finest. I overheard a conversation between Hosea, Tilly, and Lenny talking about death and how they wanted to go. Arthur said he wanted to be facing west toward the sunset and thinking about the memories he has created with the gang. That’s exactly what happened on that mountain if you went the honorable route, which honestly I feel is the best route story wise. The conversation you have with the sister at the train station nearly broke my heart. Seeing someone so gruff and physically imposing convey how scared he is in such a convincing way was such an amazing piece of acting. The way you watch Dutch slowly start to go insane and watch the downfall of the entire Van Der Linde gang is so well executed. I don’t even know that the next game I play will even have my full attention because of how well crafted and how lovingly created this game is."
reddeadredemption2,fe7z6ra,t1_fe6ohgk,1578920731.0,Seriously. Watching John and Abigail get officially married in the credits was so damn bittersweet because of the events of RDR1. Arthur was just so damn complex as a character. Everyone was so well written and so well acted. I was so immersed 95% of the time in the events that were happening in this game.
GiftofGames,fdif8ax,t3_elhu8p,1578441556.0,"Not entering, just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and a great 2020!"
Sekiro,fcg5pt4,t3_eh1q9a,1577636729.0,"I beat the game a week ago and this still pops into my head, I need a therapist."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fc5ze7z,t3_ege700,1577468985.0,"Odyssey is definitely a long, long game. Even if you don’t do a lot of the side stuff, the main game is at least 60 hours if you rush it. Spider-Man is an amazing game with about 30-40 hours of content barring the DLC. I’d say it’s definitely worth checking out even if you’re not the hugest fan of superheroes. You don’t need to worry about knowing everything about the character since it’s pretty set in stone who he is and the universe he’s set in is it’s own aside from the comic iterations."
