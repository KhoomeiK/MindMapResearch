amiugly,fffljme,t1_fffic8j,1579886570.0,"Not necessarily. While what you say is valid, I meant that close-ups of a face are too detailed. You don't look for the tiniest details and imperfections when you look at someone's face (especially a little asymmetry that practically everyone has), you judge their facial harmony as a whole. 

On the other hand, when you include the body, too, as you pointed out specifically, then you show the whole picture, and a banging body might make you more attractive, of course. Often times a banging body (read: low body fat) comes with well defined facial features - that is, more prominent bone structure that is not covered by fat."
