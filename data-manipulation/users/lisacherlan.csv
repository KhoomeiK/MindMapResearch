RealEstate,fdo21vi,t1_fdns3bo,1578597456.0,Thank you so much for responding!!! I really appreciate it! The most north part of New Jersey would be ideal. So no preference on where just as north as possible. I think I need an awesome realtor but still researching when I will buy.
RealEstate,fdnjff7,t1_fdmw2nw,1578587070.0,"Hi u/bklynboyz You don't have to answer obvi and you may not know the market I am looking at, I am just shamelessly (but very gratefully) looking for any free advice if you were compelled to share. I am looking to make an investment for more family reasons than financial and I am so scared about buying and not really knowing the areas I am looking at (other than visiting). I need to decide on what to buy and where. If you were going to invest in Danbury CT or Ridgefield CT or Patterson NY would you know of any reason to have a preference? Another place that is of interest is Goshen or New Jersey. The taxes in CT are less scary. I am more interested in cash flow than equity. If you have any opinions at all about what and where to buy (needs to be at least 2 units or could be a house with an inlaw unit) it would be a far more educated opinion than min.  TIA"

relocating,fc76r53,t3_d5yz62,1577499038.0,"I am currently preparing my dog for Asia and by far the cheapest way to relo your pet is to have them fly with you. My dog is just a bit too large to be in the cabin with me and international flights have cabin limits. But I think if you have two people flying you should be able to bring both cats in sep carriers in the cabin with you. You may even be able to bring both cats (sep carriers) with one flyer but not sure how that works. You can also have them go in cargo worst-case scenario. Some airlines have temp and pressure-controlled cargo areas when pets are in them. I didn't click on your links but I am sure you are aware of the quarantine paperwork if there is any.

Since I will already be in Asia when my dog is able to join us, one of my kids is going to fly with him. It will only be 250 for him to fly cargo to Asia and he will be in a temp and pressure-controlled room. So all said and done it is cheaper to fly my son nonstop economy and he gets a free trip to Asia. ($800 for son, $250 for dog) 

United is not good and their new partners they use charge a fortune and are terrible. United quoted me about $3k.  Good luck!!!  Always happy when I hear people are committed to taking their fur babies with them. 

I hear you can fed ex animals but I have never checked it out."
relocating,fc75b1y,t3_e16syd,1577497926.0,I would hire a realtor or a property management company to oversee and meet the movers and close up the house.
relocating,fc73yl9,t3_eaw3nr,1577496903.0,"Hi, welcome to California. I grew up here and oddly enough am looking to move (at least temp) to Asia. But enough about me. You don't really give enough detail for me to be really helpful but I will make some assumptions and try to help. If your SO's job is along the light rail or bus route you can look around areas that service that and not need a car.

More and more workers are using uber and public transportation. Some areas are Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and San Jose. Some areas are sketchier than others so it can be street by street but if you look around where the cities intersect I think those are good options. Tasman area has lots of home choices and good public transportation. There are mobile/manufactured home parks in the area and if you can rent one they seem to be a good deal but I think most people buy them. I have never lived in one but my friends have and it is quiet safe and tend to be cheaper per square foot. There are many apartments and townhouses, in the area as well. I would avoid the bigger newer apartment buildings, they charge a lot more than I think you need to pay but I am just giving my two cents as I am not a renter. Typically anything in market rate range will go immediately so you wil have a hard time finding a place more than 4-5 weeks in advance. I would have something temp arranged for first month. Also if you airbnb let your host know you are looking and what you want. Sme airbnbier get tired of the airbnb thing and may consider a good tenant. As to utilities and amenities typical rentals in this area dont come with anything included unless you go for the really boujee apartment buildings that cost a fortune per square foot.

Get your own furniture. Ikea, target, craigslist, nextdoor. Goodwill for dishes, more than enough options.

Prices: Like I said I am not a renter and I have no idea what low end is but you can prob find something for two for 2-3500. I know some landlords who rent really nice places for 3000-4000 but not where you are moving. But given what they are charging and where their properties are located you should be good in the range I said. Do be careful about renting of craigslist. I hear there are scams going on regarding people renting places without seeing them and getting taken. Don't rent a place until you have seen it. All landlords will let you walk the place.

Not sure if an IDP works here so won't comment on that.

I hope others who are renters in the area can correct anything I may be off on above. Good luck with your move!!!"
veganketo,fbf6g55,t3_ed2719,1576802785.0,"I have read different amounts for different people. Due to this, I stay at the lowest I can and stave off cramping. I add 500-1000 mg a day by making ketoade (lite salt, magnesium citrate, lime, iodized salt, water) and add Himalayan to my food. I think the amount depends on your body and diet since I have read some people adding thousands of mgs a day. I also take a potassium magnesium capsule I got at CVS if I get a cramp after keto-ade. I live with about 1 - 2 cramps a week because I don't want to overdo it. I say play around with it til you feel right. (edits for clarity)"
