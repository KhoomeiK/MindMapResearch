AmItheAsshole,fffijrm,t3_etc3tm,1579884719.0,"ESH, but gently.

On the one hand, as someone who has neurological and mental health problems, I empathize about needing someone to talk to. On the other, I also understand that everyone is going through something, and they may not have the mental energy/fortitude to be a sounding board.

Calling them out publically and reacting as you did was an overreaction, but it's one I understand, too: mental health issues tend to warp our sense of what is/isn't rational, and mistakes like these are almost inevitable. I've certainly done it, and I accept that I was TA when I did. But your friends then blowing up and making escalating threats takes it to an extreme it never should have reached.

It also sounds like you all are really young, and unfortunately, the ability to think through our responses in the moment is something that comes with maturity. I say this as an ex-teenager who was excellent at flying off the handle.

You're all learning and growing, and as such will be making a lot of mistakes along the way. We may not always make great decisions or say the smartest things (especially when mental health throws wrenches in the works), but we can at least control how we *respond* to them.

I highly recommend talking to a therapist about strategies moving forward, both in this situation and in the future. My therapist has helped me develop some great skills both in dealing with my own issues and with how I interact with others. From your replies to others, it seems like you're willing to accept when you've made a mistake and willing to learn and grow from it as well. Those traits already put you waaaaay ahead of the game."

My grandmother is the true narcissist and I think she sunk her nails into mom a little too deep. Mom tried to break the cycle, and mostly she's ""yes"" in her own way, but she's also done some incredibly abusive things (never physically, but emotionally and with lots of gaslighting). It's a very Jekyll/Hyde scenario that's really draining. Years ago, she said to me on the verge of tears that she didn't want to turn into her mother. She escaped the FOG and we're both NC, but my grandmother's influence was just too much to eliminate completely, I guess. She's made progress, though, and the ""Hyde"" days are fewer than they were.

My therapist recommended the book *Will I Ever Be Good Enough?* and if you're a woman with an nmom, ***you have to read this book.*** It is validating and informative and *insanely* helpful, especially with tips on how to break the cycle. I know it's helped me identify when my own behavior borders on toxic so I can shut that shit down and reflect. It's a must-read. I wish I knew a good version that's broader than mother/daughter, but I've heard good things about *Disarming the Narcissist* and *Stop Walking On Eggshells.* I think there's another one my therapist recommended called *Running On Empty* that's supposed to be good, too.

The biggest difference I see between my mom and my grandmother is that my mom has the ability to (however grudgingly) accept when the truth doesn't fit whatever narrative she's come up with (ex: she *knew* I was just a lazy procrastinator, but oh boy, the look of shame/irritation on her face when I raved about how much my ADD meds helped me. Of course, now the story is ""I always knew you had it,"" but I don't have the spare fucks to fight her about it). *So* not the case with my grandmother, who displays some of the most staggering levels of cognitive dissonance I've seen in my life.

My mom made the conscious decision to break the chain, but didn't have the resources or support to break from my grandmother completely until the damage was too deep. Now, I think that making the conscious decision is absolutely a start and keeps us from being full-blown Ns, but it takes further effort after that to avoid falling into the same patterns of behavior."
