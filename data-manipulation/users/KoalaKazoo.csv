crows,ffede5y,t3_eswmml,1579843922.0,Love the feathers and eye! Very realistic.
fashionadvice,ffaw18n,t1_ffavric,1579745800.0,Thanks! Great idea!
houston,ffalze4,t1_ffaldmd,1579739071.0,Thanks!
houston,ffaij6s,t1_ffahbmp,1579736557.0,Thanks!
fashionadvice,ffagmzo,t1_ffagggr,1579735293.0,Thanks! I'll be sure to pack layers in case it gets chilly.
houston,ffag3du,t1_ffaecn8,1579734933.0,"Yes and no. Yes because my husband has a few appointments there next week, and no because we're also making this a family vacation to sightsee."
houston,ffafwly,t1_ffae2ah,1579734805.0,Good point!
houston,ffacujr,t1_ffacpo7,1579732542.0,"Thanks! I'll be sure to pack a few jeans and long sleeve tops, as well."
houston,ffabqd1,t1_ffabfvf,1579731794.0,Thanks!
houston,ffabobv,t1_ffabi06,1579731759.0,"Guess it's a matter of perspective. Like I said, compared to Georgia and Florida, in my opinion, Portland is no where close to being""hot."""
houston,ffab54v,t1_ffaaukv,1579731450.0,"I've lived here four years, and compared to Georgia and Florida (where I've previously lived), Portland doesn't hold a candle when it comes to the number of hot days."
houston,ffaai66,t1_ffaa5ab,1579731080.0,"Thanks! Unfortunately I only have rain boots and snow boots (Portland, OR doesn't get very many sunny/hot days)."
houston,ffaa91c,t1_ffaa1u7,1579730936.0,"Thanks! I'm in Portland, OR, so it's still definitely sweater weather here."
houston,ffaa2kv,t1_ffaa0zb,1579730834.0,Thanks!
houston,ffa9zy6,t1_ffa9x3n,1579730790.0,"Maybe, but it'd be nice getting actual feedback."
Advice,ffa84k1,t1_ff8e48k,1579729736.0,"Thanks, this helped! You're probably right that being blunt is the best route. I've tried saying similar things before, but she either forgets, or is just too ADHD to wait for updates. Maybe if I just keep saying the same talking points it'll eventually stick."
Advice,ff6mxoa,t1_ff6medy,1579630622.0,"Thanks, this helped. I've actually told her something fairly similar in the past, but maybe I need to say it again."
grammar,fehc6tp,t1_fehc1b1,1579113551.0,Thanks! That makes complete sense.
offmychest,fdlyho4,t1_fdlrjo8,1578535523.0,"Really, you can't go wrong with questions like, ""how's your day going?"", ""What do you think about the weather we've been having?"", and ""How were your holidays?"" 

Compliments like these are also typically pretty safe:

""You're really good at [projects like this/proofreading/ editing...], would you mind helping me out?""  - The key here is to compliment her intelligence or abilities. Hopefully she'll be flattered that you asked for help and as you're working together, you'll start small talking. 

""Wow, you have such a great sense of humor!"" - or pick some other personality trait you like. Once again, compliment things that make her feel like you're actually listening to her/paying attention to something other than her physical appearance."
