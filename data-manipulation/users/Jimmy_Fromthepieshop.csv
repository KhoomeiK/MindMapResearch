But don't you see, this is exactly why the planet is being fucked up. EVERYBODY wants more for less and environment-destroying technology and growth is the only way to attain it. 

I think if you really want to feel better and more positive you should quit your job and use your time and money to actually help. Set up some kind of business that educates people or provides people with environmentally-friendly good and services, for example.
