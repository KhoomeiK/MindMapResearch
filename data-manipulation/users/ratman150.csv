InsaneTechnology,feviux8,t3_eqfei0,1579397929.0,"Trucker here, while we do need alternative designs if concrete and/or asphalt cannot hold the weight of an 80k+ truck over time then plastic with hollow tubes won't fair well either.

The modular design is cool, however I recall this exact gif being showed years ago and it dying with solar roadways. I could see it working for pedestrian traffic or something else but I doubt it would work well with traffic.

To add, plastic doesn't work well with abrasive material, in winter climates this will be an issue or just general dirt being crushed into the plastic. 

I think the best ""eco"" solution would be to use grated and packed dirt as it can easily be repaired and doesn't require any extra materials. The reality is if local municipalities aren't willing to repair current road technologies (including dirt) plastic is definitely a bad idea.



Feel free to add."

The most frustrating thing for me about the country is that people actually support these policies, and are vocal about it.

I will admit I did not vote in 2016, it was a combination of me believing it was pointless and not being able to get to a place to vote. I now see that 1. Turns out you get jury duty either way as I have gotten it twice 2. I was wrong not to vote and have no one but myself to blame 3. If I want change it is my responsibility to make that happen.

I apologize for somewhat repeating myself however, what you've said needs to be read. At the time of the 2016 election I was 20 I believe and had the mentality of ""what does it matter what I do, it won't affect the outcome"". If this were true voting would not exist.

To the people that hold this mentality or the mentality of ""it's rigged"". Remember we created this country with the idea that the public more or less controlled the outcome of laws. If it were rigged it wouldn't be a big deal that Trump won and we wouldn't have investigated how or why that may have happened artificially.
