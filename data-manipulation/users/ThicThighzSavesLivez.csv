hiphopheads,ff6hp31,t1_ff6hm7u,1579627432.0,That‚Äôs where it gets sticky with both words. Bitch can also be used as a term to emasculate another male rapper/peer. So it depends on the usage.
hiphopheads,ff6hgjw,t3_erxq2c,1579627287.0,"No to all of that. If some mofo calls me a Bitch while joking, or as a ‚Äúcompliment‚Äù I‚Äôm scratching their fuckin eyes out then going straight to Ya Mama jokes. Bitch and the N word are still similar. I can use it but you can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs just how it is. Bitch isn‚Äôt cool and women still get treated subpar, so neither of your arguments really stick."
offmychest,ff61sxu,t3_erv9bz,1579616961.0,"No. You already said you were attached. End it now before it‚Äôs too late. Love yourself enough to listen to the red flags.

offmychest,ff38f3z,t3_erdrgz,1579536137.0,"Agreed. I have always had dogs, and I‚Äôm keenly aware that some people just don‚Äôt like them. I hate it when rude dog owners say, ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs friendly. He‚Äôs only playing‚Äù. The reality is it doesn‚Äôt matter. If I want to walk outside my house and not have a dog sniff my crotch or approach me, then that‚Äôs my prerogative.  The same people don‚Äôt pick up after their dog when their off leash at a human parks either. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pick your dog up, other dogs will think it‚Äôs a toy‚Äù‚Äîwhat?!  How bout teach your dog some manners fool

Bravo to you for recognizing how ridiculous it is and not going along with it. Next time you‚Äôre invited, just tell them it‚Äôs too chaotic for your comfort level. I hate those type of dog people. They‚Äôre the same ones who don‚Äôt know why their dog bit someone or something. The same ones who pay no attention to dog cues or behavior. You‚Äôre a way cooler dog owner by default."

If this is acceptable to you, then you need to break up immediately and learn to love yourself before you date ever again. Otherwise you‚Äôll pick a low class loser who‚Äôs abusive, and makes you feel bad because they feel bad. And they only feel better about themself once you feel bad about yourself. Move on, Sis.

FemaleDatingStrategy,feiptzg,t3_epc5j8,1579144223.0,"Yes girl!! I was in a LTR with someone who wouldn‚Äôt cry/acknowledge painful emotions or feel deep feelings for things that most people would, like death of a loved one or job loss. He felt bad and sad but unable to sit with those feelings for longer than five minutes. However, he‚Äôd blow a gasket at small inconveniences, like forgetting something or dropping something by accident. I feel like it‚Äôs the result of undeveloped emotional processing. He didn‚Äôt learn how to process or where to place them, so as he grew up, he just shoved really bad things into a ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do anything about that box‚Äù and moved on. Meanwhile he was hard to connect with emotionally. Decent human. Clueless. But definitely hadn‚Äôt learned any emotional intelligence."
offmychest,feiobj5,t3_epcnnf,1579143204.0,Speak to a counselor about your feelings to help you sort them out. Otherwise you‚Äôre just sitting around tortured by your thoughts. That‚Äôs no way to live and not helpful to your situation. Good luck.

While it doesn‚Äôt make sense now as an adult, there‚Äôs no need to shame yourself or feel bad.

You saved yourself years of toil, frustration, depression, manipulation, self abuse, and exhaustion. That truly deserves a big pat on the back and a celebration. You won‚Äôt be alone. The fear is there but you won‚Äôt be alone. There are so many high value men waiting to be with you. Don‚Äôt focus on the one you lost, rather on the amazing people you‚Äôll meet in the future. Focus on yourself and why you chose your ex in the first place. Otherwise you‚Äôll find another one just like him, and be back at square one. Show yourself nothing but self love. 
Secondly just be there for your mom. Support her and love her, if you have that kind of relationship.  Imagine Your feelings about her diagnosis times ten, that‚Äôs how your mom feels. Being present and just showing love is all you need. But mostly be kind to yourself."

Don‚Äôt buy her anything. Don‚Äôt try to be her friend. Your relationship with her probably was never great and she was just pretending. Don‚Äôt tell her secrets and don‚Äôt beat yourself up for it. You‚Äôre 16 and this IS NOT the rest of your life. You will get older and have the autonomy to choose how you want live it, and choose what type of person you will be. I‚Äôm sorry your situation sucks so bad. It does. But you can do this. You‚Äôre close. Focus on yourself, write down some goals for after high school (how to make a living/start a career, where you might live, etc) and start working to achieve them now while you don‚Äôt have to pay rent. Don‚Äôt seek your cousin‚Äôs approval or anyone else‚Äôs for that matter. Focus on yourself and you‚Äôll look back one day and see how far you‚Äôve come. Also, try to see a counselor or mental health professional, they can help you with those goals and get your mind off your cousin, and focused on you. Best of luck to you!"
