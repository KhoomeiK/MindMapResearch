unpopularopinion,fet5od6,t3_eqg1ns,1579372059.0,"I think there's (unintentionally) two thoughts here that are getting conflated. On paper, I'd agree that harmonically it's not that great as a written composition. It's basically the same four chords throughout the verse & chorus, and besides the post-chorus ""hey""/""yay"" part there isn't much variety or contrasting parts. Instead it pretty much relies only on dynamics to differentiate the sections of the song (not that that is inherently a bad thing). I will say the melody is catchy, which is probably why it's repeated as the guitar solo.

However, the song didn't become so popular because it's the most technically well written song ever, but because of the raw, DIY energy it provides as an alternative to the slick, overproduced rock sound that was popular at the time. This leads to my most important point and why I disagree that it is ""overrated"": the immediate and lasting legacy of the song is that it clicked with people and *inspired* people to make similar music. Whether one thinks the song itself is great, good, bad, or horrible, the fact that it set the tone for a lot of the rock music that came after it for several years cannot be denied. 

To me, the thought that ""it's not that great of a song"" and thinking it ""is highly overrated"" don't necessarily have to be linked. The fact that it has cemented a place for itself in rock/popular music/culture is not dependent on what any one person thinks of the actual song itself.

I don't need to look at, or compare, sheet music to know if something is music or not. That seems to be the (incorrect) assumption that you're basing your opinion on. Comparing the sheet music of Fur Elise to the sheet music of Mary Had a Little Lamb does not diminish the latter's existence as a piece of music itself.

>The apocryphal ""things"" I alluded to would be the other parts of musical notation such as time signatures etc.

Still, extremely vague. You claim there are ""things"" but can only name one when pressed to do so multiple times.

Not to mention that knowledge of musical notation is not required to write music or songs, again seemingly an (incorrect) assumption on your part.
