She is 5 year old Siamese cat and pretty adorable. She has this habit of jumping upon people like If she likes someone and if she sees you after long time she will straight away jump upon you and start licking you, she also demands attention at regular interval of times but the best part is whatever you feed to her she will eat without creating any fuss and whenever I visit her and stay there she would always sleep next to me and before sleeping she would rub her paw over my hairs and give me a little kiss and then sleep <3 she is our little angel. Actually you know my mom also once had a cat but after she died due to some ailment my mom got very upset and hurt and she decided not to have pet again because saying goodbye was too difficult for her but when I will get my job I will keep 3 pets -  1 fish, 1 cat and one parrot and might be in future one pup also that will be my best home.

I was literally thinking lately to transition totanks as I have played DPS and supports for long time but now thinking to gravitate towards tanks, mostly I want to learn off tanks (except ball, too much complicated for me xD ) really thanks for this guide and video , just wanted to ask that tanks do require some command over mechanics to play better right?"
Paladins,fda3rhv,t1_fda1xkp,1578241344.0,I like yetis!
OverwatchUniversity,fd98471,t1_fd8t43l,1578229730.0,thank you so much will definitely check them out though everybody knows chipsa and brandito but check rest of them also I have heard that sp9rk1e is one of the best dps players joining owl but he isn't better than sinatraa right? He was mvp no last time?
PaladinsAcademy,fd8q4um,t1_fd8pue3,1578221702.0,"Nope as far as I know, though I am also not sure but yeah let's wait hopefully people will clarify"
Paladins,fd8pz5j,t3_ek6w11,1578221634.0,GG SO MUCH EZ!!
Paladins,fd8pk0m,t3_ek6gtk,1578221447.0,How many total crystals and coins you have now?
PaladinsAcademy,fd8p9pc,t3_ekbg9j,1578221309.0,"In case you are asking for tanks I would say Main tanks are anyone with basic shields and mostly contest the objective whereas most off tanks go in with your dps and help in finishing the enemies though honestly there is not much of a difference between these 2 playstyles as you can easily switch.

Makoa, Atlas, Raum, Ruckus , Ash are basically off tanks , while barik,fernando,khan, inara are more like main tanks"
OverwatchUniversity,fd8o73w,t1_fd7vodt,1578220806.0,"Really thanks a lot I will focus on learning basics first only then will go for rollouts in future, moreover I watched some pro gameplay and not every time people use rollouts and stuff mostly basic mechanics are used"

PaladinsAcademy,fd7p5or,t3_ek90gl,1578207923.0,I love spawn camping mostly whenever I play flanks and if I see their support died I immediately sneak to their spawn and kill poor thing again of course not all the time but yeah spawn camping is occasionally good specially if your team back you it can be soothing! People hurling abuses and the increase in energy is magnetic XD

OverwatchUniversity,fd260bf,t3_eas4pg,1578142242.0,If I want to learn doomfist is it a compulsory requirement that first I have to learn his rollouts on all maps and that rocket punch bounce thing he does? How often do you as doomfist player perform roll outs?
