gainit,ffj52jf,t1_ffj439p,1579990600.0,"Thanks for sharing. Did you read the book Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker? I felt like a lot of the things you wrote resonates with the advice he gives in the book. I don't quite have insomnia and I get around 7-8 hours of sleep per night, but since reading the book I've been trying to get 8 hours consistently, but exams period made that a bid tougher.

Tell me more about the magnesium vitamin, do you need a special type or does a regular daily vitamin do the job just fine?

Another tip you could add to this very nice list is to make sure you go to bed and wake up around the same hours every single day, even the weekend. That is the most important advice that is given in the book and by literally every single sleep scientist. The daily rhythm is so important for our bodies and it really makes a huge difference."
dkfinance,ffipeg5,t3_eturm1,1579979417.0,"Hvis du er på hel bar bund vil jeg foreslå at starte med at læse vores [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/dkfinance/wiki/index), det giver dig en basal ide om alle aspekter.

Som der bliver nævnt er det vigtigt at du finder ud af hvad du vil bruge de penge ud investere til senere i livet og hvornår du skal bruge dem. Eks. skal der spares op til køb af hus eller andet? Hvis der er en meget lavere tidshorisont end pension kan det påvirke hvad du investere i.

>Indtil videre har jeg læst, at det er bedst at investere direkte igennem netbank fremfor foreninger, men er dette korrekt?

Det er lidt svært at forstå hvad du mener her. Taler du om at bruge din egen banks investerings muligheder som f.eks. [Nordea Nora](https://www.nordea.dk/privat/produkter/investering/nora-digitale-investeringsraadgiver.html), [Jyske Invest](https://www.jyskebank.dk/produkter/investering/jyskeinvestering), og alle de andre? Eller mener du at købe aktier direkte i din netbank? Hvis det er den første skal du være opmærksom på den årlige omkostninger i procent (ÅOP) som du betaler for at lade dem gøre arbejdet for dig. Hvis det er nr. 2 skal du være opmærksom på den gebyr for køb/salg og depot opbevaring som du betaler til din egen bank.

Generelt er de fleste banker i Danmark meget dyre hvad det angår og du kan spare rigtig mange penge hvis du selv sætter dig ind i tingene og f.eks. bruger Nordnet eller Saxo, hvor der er lave omkostninger for køb af aktier eller endnu bedre hvis du vælger et par indekser som har god spredning over et globalt marked. Aktiesparekonto er også et godt valg."

1. adaptation of the central nervous system, e.g. you become more efficient at firing up your muscle fibers and are able to lift more weight as a result.

2. increase in muscle mass

3. better form on exercises including being able to activate your muscles better

But it is also worthwhile to consider energy level, if you are depleted of carbs you just don't have the energy to lift heavy all the time. This is why strength progress comes so easily during a bulk, you are fully loaded with carbs for every gym session and ready to lift heavy shit.

This is also one of the primary reasons why you shouldn't continue to lift as heavy as you do when you switch over from a bulk to a cut. You won't have the energy to keep up the same intensity and you will burn yourself out."
