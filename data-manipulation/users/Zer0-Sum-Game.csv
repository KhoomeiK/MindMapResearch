I should note that my ex-girlfriend was taken into a home immediately, while I was explicitly told not to stay in that house, even to warm up for an afternoon.  I had a job, it wasn't about rent.

Whatcouldgowrong,ffd3vns,t1_ffcy7u9,1579812911.0,"IDK, we still don't know how they built some of those ancient colossal structures, because they had the physical intellect to make wood, rope, and muscle do what we need many hours of specialized development *to match at some scales*.  Why don't we know exactly how they did it?  Everything they did, short of the construction, was biodegradable.  We have very few technical advancements that properly survived from that era, and that's because some dumb assholes would, at random times, burn knowledge and kill the people that understood it.  But that doesn't mean those skills weren't worth learning in the first place.

In case you are wondering why I'd be talking about ancient construction techniques like we'd actually have something to learn, I'm saying that something we once knew was lost.  Imagine if we *didn't* have technophobic barbarians ruining things every few centuries?  I point at ceramics, one of humanity's earliest technologies.  We've been refining it for millennia, from pottery to body armor, from decoration to springs.  Or ancient philosophies about the world?  We can always figure out who was right from the past and use that to focus our minds on the future.  We taught and preserved that.

Physical skills are largely similar, from a logical standpoint.  We've had a lot of time to research and understand our bodies.  Problem is, we no longer have a good *sense* of our bodies.  It's the difference between being smart and being intelligent.  One can be learned, and be useless without practice.  The other can be experienced, but is worthless without application.  There is a large gap of awareness between the logical and the physical in this world, and I feel like that *might* have something to do with *not getting people to put any physical effort into changing things*.  One of those things we could *logically* change is valuing physical skills more, because inventors and philosophers got nowhere without the ability to mock up an example.  Between computer modeling and 3D printing, that's easier than ever to appreciate."

AskReddit,ffcvemy,t1_ffctdgs,1579808063.0,"Yes, I understand this, and one of those underlying issues is an inability to be just one thing.  I have no less than two equal thoughts about everything I've been presented with, both usually valid, but generally from opposing positions.  That would be logic and emotion.  On top of that, my logic advanced in leaps and bounds, while my emotions lagged behind by half.  Thus, I'm mentally able to squeak by at a basic level of function, in spite of massive emotional instability (think mind of an 80 year old, but the sense of a teenager, I come out *just a little* ahead).  So, every thread pulled will inherently pull another thread, and I need someone who has the ability to track two things at once to avoid meltdown.

The last person I talked to was employed for worker rehabilitation.  He had 3 hours to establish a base, and only laid 1/3 of the foundation.

You should watch your dog poop, sometimes.  They doesn't have the ability to communicate their gastric distresses.  If they are gassy, loose, or ""fluffy"", you should consider stepping up the food you feed them.

They are born of predators, that means they have been designed to squeeze as much out of the thing they chased as possible.  Cows can afford to shit out the extra, dogs are supposed to drop tight, small poops.

You don't even need to go top shelf.  My brand has a chow type food, not the cheapest but they've been making dog food a while, they know how much they can cut.  For 1-4 dollars more, respective to bag size, the next better thing in their brand has stopped most of the above issues in the dogs I've cared for, and my dog actually likes his food, now.

A separate note for cat owners, if your cat suddenly starts urinating in strange places, take em to the vet to get their pee checked.  I know less about cats, but that should be fairly consistent, from what I've learned.  Also, check their poop."

Muscle memory and what percent of the body you can make use of at once are better, and more comparable, measures of physical intelligence.  It's still short a couple metrics, but I'm willing to bet coaches and physical therapists would be able to fill in some gaps.  Just avoid the purely subjective stuff and focus on comparison and base functionality, same as IQ testing.

I sincerely fail to understand *how* well I use my body is any less important than *how* I use my mind.  We understand animal bodies better than our own, in a lot of ways.  To me, that's like focusing on space like it's going to rot away, meanwhile our oceans are being destroyed by our lack of concern even as we don't appreciate it's immediate value.  *It's right fucking there!* and won't be forever (by a cosmic scale)!  Same as our bodies vs minds, the logic can be taught and learned as long as it was shared, but the body has maybe 30 to 40 prime years to make it's mark, and we need to embrace this so that people can start putting skills *and* intellect together, for a stronger and more capable future.

I had played it as a young child, got to Giygas, never beat him and the cartridge was lost to time, but it was (debatably is) my favorite game of all time.  So I was heartbroken that my ""conqueror's copy"" and memento of respect was ripped from me.  I felt physically incomplete without a copy in my library.  So when I saw it at the store at the same time as I had money, I filled that hole in my heart for that pittance and change, and knocked out an afternoon playthrough to make it right.

If my uneducated redneck ass has the idea correctly, all of our ideas about the end of the universe will result in further out, smaller, denser universes, answering the question of where our universe started, a bigger, slower, hotter, lighter universe.

Tbh, the only thing that would keep it from doing that while cooking is that compounds can't remain stable at those temps.
