creepy,ffoel96,t1_ffoct3c,1580076836.0,There's one lady in particular that I just love - very demented - but she recognizes me and thinks I'm her husband. She's always very sweet and tells me how handsome I am and flirts and whatnot. I just hope that if my life ends that way I will be as happy and caring as that lady still is.
creepy,ffod396,t1_ffoc828,1580076455.0,"I should note that the ones who are upset or sad are the ones who know that they are losing their minds. I DO feel terrible for them and I dread that part of my life coming around.

I just think that in some ways it is a blessing - I mean; once the dementia progresses to a point they have no sense of death approaching or any real fear of what's to come. They just constantly rehash the good old days or spend much of their time sleeping."
creepy,ffoc828,t1_ffmn25b,1580076159.0,I don't know about that...I work with dementia patients and I can say that most of them are just blissfully unaware of their state and constantly reliving memories - like a lucid dream almost. I deal with some that are normally irritable or angry but most are either just out to lunch or happily reliving the good times.

creepy,ffjc3zd,t1_ffiyqln,1579995177.0,Absolutely.
dankmemes,ffiv1fs,t1_ffi2dck,1579983413.0,"Me too - because that method doesn't clog the jail system or cost the taxpayers money for someone else's pathetic life choices :)

However, I should note that Americans actually usually jail people rather than kill them. I mean.... Just look at our overflowing jails/prisons and consider how many Americans are horrified by the death penalty.

Sorry, fuckers. In REAL life, some of your choices are going to have unsavory consequences. Look at nature - that's some real shit right there. The only thing separating you from that kind of real shit is society. Be thankful you're not a gazelle waiting to be eaten alive by a hyena."
