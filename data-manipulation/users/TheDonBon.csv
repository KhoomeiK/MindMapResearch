educationalgifs,fft9471,t1_fft8vtx,1580212920.0,And thighs?
facepalm,ffqdw2z,t1_ffq2pir,1580131629.0,"She's surprisingly calm through the whole thing, like it's just another day of having her life saved."
asoiaf,ffqdrly,t1_ffq8nki,1580131515.0,"Can't you drop out of Night's Watch training if you were a volunteer? I vaguely remember a reference to this, but it may have been some other fantasy book. If that's the case, I'd expect Tarly would be better served sending Sam to College, as he's more likely to graduate there."
asoiaf,ffjmsj1,t1_ffimli3,1580001865.0,"Man, that part was so hard to read, when you take into consideration how many of her friends and family died from it."
asoiaf,ffjmlvi,t1_ffipd2i,1580001737.0,"Now I have to re-read for Robb, my last read I figured out Arya warged into a cat and warged into Nymeria across a continent, both of which seem really powerful."
asoiaf,ffjmbvf,t1_ffiomwt,1580001554.0,"Agreed. It was a neat way of portraying not just that the watch and North hate the wildlings, but also WHY they hate the wildlings."
asoiaf,fffmyp8,t1_fffi9p3,1579887435.0,"True, and he brings The North. I just hadn't realized how well he fits into an argument for ""Renly wants to be seen as the new Robert."""
asoiaf,fffb6kn,t1_fff3h82,1579880101.0,"Unrelated, but it just hit me that Renly wanted Ned's support because it mirrored his brother. I knew he was copying Bobby with wanting his wife to look like Lyanna and usurping the throne as the charismatic savior, but I never realized that's probably why he tried to save Ned."
asoiaf,fffavyp,t1_fff06es,1579879911.0,"Honestly, my favorite part of the early books is how well George portrays ineptitude in his characters. You read it the first time with the assumption that they kinda know what they're doing, then on the re-read you can see all the spots where they fucked up and how smug they often were about their assertions. There was a scene where Ned was thinking about Tywin baiting someone to split up their forces and leave themselves undefended, meanwhile he's sending half his guard to hunt down The Mountain."
facepalm,ff3ufxh,t1_ff3jfve,1579549094.0,Whoever replies to the ad will also catch both of those hands
asoiaf,fel7252,t1_feiotqe,1579215449.0,"Most here are pretty salty, but this realistically has potential, I can't imagine not wanting it made."
asoiaf,fel6x6d,t1_fejqi54,1579215364.0,That's a lot of budget for a lightly related flashback. Especially considering it makes all the current time dragons look lamer.
asoiaf,feh0fx5,t1_fegyr2n,1579106541.0,Just another added benefit. You always want good things to say when you announce new things.
asoiaf,fef8r8g,t1_fedxewv,1579050857.0,"It's not about second copies, it's just marketing. If you don't own the book, instead of ""here's a paperback edition of the book you've already not bought"" it's ""here's version of the book you've thought about buying, except now it's even better."""

technology,fcx60jf,t1_fcw6sdp,1578052680.0,"The way I see it, TurboTax is that super helpful mod that makes a game way more playable, so the developers just go ahead and add its features to the game."
AskReddit,fcx56ey,t1_fcwhp1b,1578051685.0,"The first half is about his experience, and the second is the more technical, psychiatry discussion if I remember correctly."
AskReddit,fcx542a,t1_fcw2006,1578051604.0,That line in the book about the relativity of sorrow is one of the most meaningful things I've ever read. Something to the effect of sorrow being like a gas in a container.
asoiaf,fc5s23z,t3_egbc69,1577464605.0,"I loved the book in general, but I found it really hard to find any likeable characters during this section. The only thing that nagged at me with F&B is that I often felt like he was writing a collection of pitches for HBO."
