Futurology,ffiwidl,t1_ffihknt,1579984411.0,"Something I forgot to mention: public transport seems to be a major turn-off for some people because of the time it takes to get to a station, then transportation time itself, then exit and get to the actual destination, including waiting times, etc. 

But people seem to forget that despite these ""extra steps"", one is usually just as fast (or faster) if there is proper local infrastructure. Sure, one can still be late, etc but that's either due to bad time management, human error and/or simply sub-optimal infrastructure.

Also, using the current (mediocre to non-existent) state of public transport as a benchmark isn't really helping - instead, one should compare to already well-designed infrastructure in order to realize how much time one would *save* if a proper system was implemented.

With that in mind, few people realize how stressful driving your own car through traffic can be on a daily basis. We just get used to it rather quickly and don't notice how much time we actually waste because it feels like we are actively doing something, even though we are just sitting inside a metal box, mostly waiting for our journey to continue.

While public transportation certainly has its drawbacks (especially from the perspective of people who hate public space and are annoyed even by the slightest interaction), one could easily get some work done, have a nap, read, listen to music, etc. without having to worry about navigating through the city.

Anecdotal, but most of my colleagues who use public transport are much more relaxed when they come in, while those who have been waiting in traffic and/or had to fight for parking already had a shitty start. 

From my perspective, trading unnecessary, daily stress for potentially longer travel times (because one can still be late) sounds like a great (and healthy) deal."
Futurology,ffivel3,t1_ffihknt,1579983647.0,"> In my city, just about everyone lives in a detached home, with just about no central areas for any proposed train to drop anyone off without 15-40 minute walks in what can be 120 degree weather. Never mind that businesses are spread out and so getting people to work would also lead to major last mile issues. People already often have to go 5-20 minutes off the freeway to get to their houses. [...]

City design and infrastructure go hand in hand. There is a reason why when designing districts they take into account a lot of these things. From personal observations, I get the impression that people making these decisions often fail to properly assess future developments (which is to be expected), but also refuse to further invest and make needed changes once it becomes clear that a city/district has developed differently than expected. 

Your situation is just like every other major city out there imho: missed opportunities to make changes, either due to budget cuts or because budget was used for other, less important things as well. If no one really cares because things are ""fine"" as they are, obviously over the years things will only get worse. Which then leads to the current situations where upgrading or changing local infrastructure would become a massive and quite expensive endeavor. 

However, I still think many of these issues could be solved be re-designing certain areas and making sure public transport becomes more accessible. In areas where that's not possible, other solutions can be applied. For example, in Europe there are plenty of cities with historic districts, where it's very difficult to make changes without destroying culture. One of many solutions is to restrict access in regards of traffic and redesign those areas for pedestrians and bikes, providing plenty of options to get from A to B without having to tear down everything.

Ideally, such a process is discussed with the population, especially business owners, in order to find solutions that improve the current situation. And there sure are cases where nothing can be done and that's fine. But those areas that can be optimized, should be imho.

I'm not sure if you ever have been to Europe, but despite their struggles with typical public transport issues, their systems work fairly well imho. I've been living across the EU for a few years now and different cities have different solutions, but it's always a good mix that provides a variety of transportation solutions, depending on where you have/want to go. Frequency depends on local infrastructure and funding, but most larger cities have plenty of options to reach your destination within minutes, even across an entire city. And it's often just as fast, sometimes even faster than using a car, be it your own, Uber or taxi. Plus, reaching other nearby cities is fairly fast as well, thanks to inter-city infrastructure.

Nothing is ever impossible. If anything, it's tedious and time-consuming to optimize a city/district - but it can be done as millions of cities have managed to do during the past 100 years (more or less) successfully. 

Bottom line, I think there is *a lot* to learn from other nations, both solutions and mistakes."

Almost everything spreads ""fast"", simply because more people infect even more people. We usually just don't notice because most of the time you don't get sick and/or people don't die immediately.

Futurology,ffhm8re,t1_ffhgckd,1579942004.0,"There are quite a few different solutions to solve transportation. The problem with current systems is that it's not properly funded in most areas, be it basic infrastructure or public transport in particular.

Innovation will provide new and hopefully better solutions, but I also think we could utilize already existing systems until those new solutions can be implemented.

Why should cities have to wait another 20-40 years for e.g. self-driving cars to solve our current issues if we could just improve the situation already?

Even if there will be solid alternatives in 5 years, do you think every single city will have access to those right away, solving traffic issues instantly? It will take time just for the entire bureaucracy to get moving, then it will still depend on the available funds to upgrade the existing infrastructure, etc.

Why do we always postpone solving problems for yet another decade? We have solutions now already, we just need to optimize them. How come e.g. Japan can have public transport that is almost never late, transporting millions every single day at high frequency? As far as I know they don't use magic, so why can't other nations have this as well? It's not like their technology is a secret either."

For almost 20 years now, people have been fighting for privacy and the progress made is almost not noticeable on a larger scale, because big corporations get what they want one way or another and governments take what they want one way or another.

Fighting for privacy will become more and more and individual fight, simply because the vast majority can't grasp the concept, nor do they care enough to actually pressure politicians/corporations."

technology,fffo9qz,t1_fffh70i,1579888225.0,"> How does Signal help without convincing everyone you talk to to use Signal?

In general (not just regarding Signal) it's a slow process but some people tend to see the benefits once they understand the concept and the reasoning behind avoiding privacy-invasive services.

Others are hell-bent on avoiding privacy-oriented services as if it's the devil's work. But usually, for some reason, those people also do not seem to value friendships (or relationships) the same way I do so it doesn't really matter if we don't have much contact anymore.

That said, I'm not really trying to force people to make a decision. If they ask why I'm not using certain apps, I tell them why and what alternative I prefer. If they are interested, I help them understand risks/benefits more in-depth, if not, it is up to them to do the research and make a decision based on that or just ignore all of that (and me for that matter because for them I'm ""never available"").

Though it may seem silly that people can drift apart because of app choices, I feel like I shouldn't be forced to violate my privacy just because someone else doesn't want to protect theirs.

My advice in this regard is to do what you think is best for you. The best way to have others join you is not to give them a choice but an opportunity to educate themselves and develop a better understanding how things really work. Because in almost all cases, people simply are unable to grasp the concept of privacy or the lack thereof."

politics,fffkmic,t1_ffffalv,1579886004.0,"I feel like many people aren't always honest with themselves and unwilling to take a proper look at their lifestyle decisions. Some low-income families are spending money on things that they can't afford and aren't essential and I have a difficult time to understand why that is.

For example, a low-income family I know are heavy smokers. They are spending money to inhale toxic air. Not only does that impact their financial situation, it also impacts their health, which means increased insurance cost and medical bills in the future, possibly debt when cancer treatment is needed. All that money could be invested into their kid's education, but instead it's literally going up in smoke. 

Another low-income family I'm friends with owns two cars. Both are old, crappy cars that need constant repairs and consume way too much fuel. Just for the fun of it, I convinced them to calculate all their expenses for those two vehicles since they got them. Turns out, they could have bought a new car with all that money already. Apart from that, they don't even need a car at all, everything is within reach of 10 minutes using public transport. They could even walk to work if they really wanted to or just take a bike. They simply don't want to.

I'm sure there are plenty of these cases out there. I'm not judging nor trying to tell them how to live their lives. But it is sad to observe that some of their struggles are self-imposed and could be solved by making different decisions, possibly even just for a limited time until they have managed to improve their situation.

From my experience, it really isn't that much of an issue to restrict consumerism and take a good look at what is essential and what is not. My family came to Europe with zero belongings apart from the clothes we had on us. We worked hard and after 40 years we not only own a big house but are also debt-free and even though we could have made use of the welfare system over here, we didn't need to because despite our average education (basically high school) we all found some sort of job and worked our way up, step by step, helping each other where we could. 

So my question is: how come immigrants like my family, who didn't know the language, didn't have much help (other than a ""starter pack"" with some clothes and food stamps), average education and thus no advantages on the job market, etc. was able to achieve so much within half a life-time while others who have been much more privileged than us seem incapable of doing so? How is this entirely the system's fault?

To me, it seems like poor choices are part of the problem. 

There is no debate about billionaires exploiting people and not giving back, amassing wealth while the rest of the world suffers. And maybe most of the rich elite didn't do anything to deserve such a life in the first place. But if we assume that ""we"" (the less fortunate) deserve to be in their place, that seems rather weird. Why do we deserve more? What makes us more special or more worthy? I'll never understand that line of thinking.

Maybe UBI can solve these issues, but tbh if someone isn't able to handle their finances now, they won't be able to do so with more money either. There will always be people who are in need of more money because they are spending it on stuff that isn't essential, at least not right now. And I feel like a lot of people are just not being honest with themselves in that regard, justifying their financial decisions because they are already too invested in consumerism. Nevertheless, despite my pessimism in that regard, I will still support UBI whenever I get the chance because it seems the best solution for now, especially when automation is going to hit almost all professions in the near future.

I wish I had all the money on this planet so I could just give it to everyone to fill their lives with whatever they desire - but at the same time, I think that wouldn't solve the root cause, simply provide crutches until we figure out a better way to create a fair system. Though the question remains: what is fair and how much is a human's time worth? I don't think that can be answered without creating some sort of hierarchy where we start to put people into categories according to their value (which we already do in a way). Not sure if that's a good approach though since it is a great growth medium for division. We need to find better ways somehow."
Stellaris,fffex0r,t3_et6oor,1579882470.0,"I'm currently playing a game as a pacifist, trying to build a federation. Only problem is that everyone has rivaled everyone. So every time I have convinced someone to join my ranks, all the other empires are about to start a war with me and it requires lots of fucking around to appease them.

To be honest, it's more of a burden than a challenge and I probably won't do this again in the future. Being an aggressive species that just devours everything in its path is still the most enjoyable way to play Stellaris - meaning it's less of a pita.

EliteMiners,fff84ze,t1_fff0wag,1579878098.0,">Same as IRL if we do start mining asteroids then the value of certain metals will fall before the rocket even gets back to earth in anticipation of the material that will become available to us.

It may work like that in real life as well, but to me that seems pretty insane to base prices off of an event that may not come true. Sounds more like speculation to me tbh.

Apart from that, there is no real demand in Elite and no real economy for that matter. I think the system lacks proper production cycles that would actually result in a more realistic simulation of economy. For example, if the market is flooded with certain materials, it should impact ship prices or other products for that matter.

Stellaris,fff6vg1,t3_et2e4r,1579877221.0,"Like most games, Stellaris just simulates complexity and variety without offering real choices. I think our expectations are too high in that regard, games just can't provide what we are looking for as of now. Sure, some older games have provided a better approach here and there, but have had major flaws in other departments.

Maybe in 30 years, we will have more complex and much more realistic games that not just pretend to be complex but actually are, due to a variety of mechanics and systems that introduce *real* complexity and variety.

Until then, I don't think we should be too disappointed because things aren't going to change magically with some upcoming update. 

Maybe the devs are too busy with cosmetic overhauls, but I think the foundation of Stellaris (or any game for that matter) doesn't allow them to create realistic games as we desire. Even with an updated engine (Stellaris 2), I doubt they would be able to please us.

I believe this has partly to do with the current general attitude in game development, but that's another story."
BeAmazed,ffe2r09,t1_ffe0nuu,1579835178.0,"Not arguing against this, just sharing my experiences/observations. Way too many people just seem to assume that almost all scientists are lazy fuckers who should work harder to educate the public - and I strongly disagree with that viewpoint.

The way knowledge is shared right now is suboptimal, but there also are several professions (e.g. science journalism) that are focused on that part. I think it's unrealistic to demand that every scientist should spend more time educating the population. Since you have a channel, I'm sure you know how much work it is to make those videos. And since you are active in academia, you also must know how limited time can be, depending on what projects you are working on. Depending on work schedule/environment, some people don't even have the time they need to prepare lectures properly - and that's what they are supposed to do. Sure, there are people not working efficiently - just like in any other job. But there also are plenty of people working hard, either because they have no choice or because it is their passion. While others are shitposting, scientists are solving real problems, day by day.

It's easy (and kind of ironic) to call people lazy and/or unmotivated, especially when sitting at home, waiting for the youtube feed to magically produce easy-to-digest content. 

People like you do exist and I'm happy for you, especially since you seem able to manage doing research, writing papers, prepare lectures, making educational videos and have a healthy private life. But I know many who simply couldn't do it - be it because they are bad at work/life balance or because they have different priorities. And imho there is nothing wrong with that.

The fact that publicly funded research is behind paywalls is related to this, but the root of that problem is not that scientists are too lazy to educate the public or because they don't care about sharing their knowledge (which seems to be the opinion many people share, even if they don't know anything about the conditions of working in research). But I guess the complexity of the underlying issue is irrelevant to most people anyways, even though they could actually do something to improve the situation instead of just bitching about it."

And tbh, I think it's really weird that some people's contribution to society is merely shitting on others 24/7 while creating a massive following - meanwhile, others are really trying hard to make things better and the vast majority doesn't even care because it's taken for granted. The way I see this, it's more about how entertainment is more valued than (in this particular case) scientific research. And maybe for some it is difficult to accept that most people aren't interested in the achievements of science in general, especially when working in all these different fields, trying to contribute in a meaningful way and still be dismissed because ""it's just another religion"" etc.

Apart from that, working as a researcher is usually a full-time job. These people hardly have the extra time to make youtube videos. Those who do are very rare and quite fortunate to be able to share their findings/insights on social media on a regular basis. Also, not everyone can work in science communication for various reasons.

In many (imho actually in all) cultures, mental health issues are still considered a weakness. These people will never get help, even if they suspect they might have mental health issues. 

Humans are great actors; deception and manipulation are skills we all have mastered to some degree. You don't have to fool the masses, all you have to do is fool yourself that you don't need treatment. I really believe the vast majority is capable of doing so. Plus, a lot of people have so many issues from various (childhood) trauma as well as struggles to survive in our societies, which might overshadow any symptoms that would be attributed to mental health issues otherwise.

Almost everything we do is about escaping reality. Taking a look at humans all around the planet, while our lifestyles may vastly differ, we all need a break from our daily struggles and we happily dive into any opportunity to do so, some more than others. If it's entertainment, drugs, religion, more work, etc. it's all about drowning the demons within us. We'd much rather spend an entire weekend doing whatever we think is important to our fragile existence instead of dealing with our mental health. Even the notion that mental health is only relevant when symptoms are noticeable is quite telling imho. The moment symptoms are obvious it's already ""too late"". You don't fix a house when it's about to fall apart, you continuously take care of it to avoid any substantial damage in the first place.

Just as we like to postpone dealing with massive global issues because we are waiting for some miracle to solve it for us, we like to postpone taking care of our mental health because we refuse to take it seriously. We'd rather pretend that we are fine and find more efficient ways to ignore it instead of being honest with ourselves and start taking care of our mental health.  

Additionally, if your entire existence is a struggle for survival, you probably won't have the time and resources to take mental health seriously. I'd argue that the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues is actually a luxury. It can only happen if you have time to breathe and take a break and realize that there is something wrong, despite all the positive aspects of your life. You then still need a proper healthcare system, well-educated doctors and money to begin your recovery - something that is denied to the vast majority on this planet as well.

Seven of Nine is one of my favorite characters because of her struggle with human concepts. For me, it was an entirely new concept/viewpoint that was explored with her transition and it also questioned our behaviors, morals/ethics, etc in a different way than the usual ""alien meets human and is confused about our customs"" theme. There is something quite novel about re-discovering humanity as a human who has been removed at a young age, growing up within a hivemind during the most relevant time of development that shapes us fundamentally in so many different ways.

Obviously, they only scratched the surface because it turned into fan service pretty quick, not really exploring the full potential of this character (and all the others for that matter), but I'm still not mad about the writing because at least they tried to implement something of substance unlike other writers.

As a kid I didn't really have much control over this, I often was persuaded to play in front of family/friends and I hated it. Sometimes because of the criticism, sometimes because of what felt like dishonest compliments, sometimes because of the voiced indifference (""so boring""), etc. I think the lack of constructive feedback from actual professionals and the mostly discouraging comments by everyone else basically ruined live performances for me early on. 

The few garage bands I joined/founded during college/uni all ended up playing live, at which point I quit after a few live performances. Every time I got replaced I always felt those guys did a far better job than me. I wanted people to get the best out of their time/money investment when they decided to see a band/artist - I felt like I couldn't provide that. I was more than happy to make room for someone more talented or at least more interested in performing live. Plus, I never liked being on a stage, all eyes on me. The quality of my performance never was impacted much by this, I just didn't enjoy the experience.

Several decades later, not playing live makes my passion much more enjoyable when all I do is making music all by myself. At this point, I'm not even interested in playing in garage bands anymore since it always gravitates towards making money sooner or later, which I'm not interested in. In a weird way I'd still love to perform live but at the same time I'm pretty sure I would not enjoy it after all these years.

Since my income does not rely on making music, there is no need for change.

The distinction between lack of balance and a broken mechanic is irrelevant imho, since in both cases a nerf (or a buff) is aiming to restore game balance from the perspective of the developer. 

As far as I know, mining mechanics (respectively related economy mechanics) weren't broken/buggy before - what made it *look* ""broken"" is the (still ignored) fact that other professions are massive time sinks with low profit margins. Frontier simply didn't expect people to dedicate so much time towards mining, nor to develop strategies to make it *that* profitable. So in that sense, the flaw wasn't bad code, it was the typical (and naively unexpected) result of humans solving problems with the tools they are provided with.

Before the change, we already had a ""realistic"" economy, it just didn't take into account the player's desire to seek out the path of least resistance (mining) instead of investing time into other content. 

With that in mind, the change clearly is a nerf because it ""reduces the [...] effectiveness of a particular game element."" 

A better change would have been to buff other professions so they are equally lucrative.

In general (not just regarding Signal) it's a slow process but some people tend to see the benefits once they understand the concept and the reasoning behind avoiding privacy-invasive services.

Others are hell-bent on avoiding privacy-oriented services as if it's the devil's work. But usually, for some reason, those people also do not seem to value friendships (or relationships) the same way I do so it doesn't really matter if we don't have much contact anymore.

That said, I'm not really trying to force people to make a decision. If they ask why I'm not using certain apps, I tell them why and what alternative I prefer. If they are interested, I help them understand risks/benefits more in-depth, if not, it is up to them to do the research and make a decision based on that or just ignore all of that (and me for that matter because for them I'm ""never available"").

Though it may seem silly that people can drift apart because of app choices, I feel like I shouldn't be forced to violate my privacy just because someone else doesn't want to protect theirs.

My advice in this regard is to do what you think is best for you. The best way to have others join you is not to give them a choice but an opportunity to educate themselves and develop a better understanding how things really work.

politics,fffkmic,t1_ffffalv,1579886004.0,"I feel like many people aren't always honest with themselves and unwilling to take a proper look at their lifestyle decisions. Some low-income families are spending money on things that they can't afford and aren't essential and I have a difficult time to understand why that is.

For example, a low-income family I know are heavy smokers. They are spending money to inhale toxic air. Not only does that impact their financial situation, it also impacts their health, which means increased insurance cost and medical bills in the future, possibly debt when cancer treatment is needed. All that money could be invested into their kid's education, but instead it's literally going up in smoke. 

Another low-income family I'm friends with owns two cars. Both are old, crappy cars that need constant repairs and consume way too much fuel. Just for the fun of it, I convinced them to calculate all their expenses for those two vehicles since they got them. Turns out, they could have bought a new car with all that money already. Apart from that, they don't even need a car at all, everything is within reach of 10 minutes using public transport. They could even walk to work if they really wanted to or just take a bike. They simply don't want to.

I'm sure there are plenty of these cases out there. I'm not judging nor trying to tell them how to live their lives. But it is sad to observe that some of their struggles are self-imposed and could be solved by making different decisions, possibly even just for a limited time until they have managed to improve their situation.

From my experience, it really isn't that much of an issue to restrict consumerism and take a good look at what is essential and what is not. My family came to Europe with zero belongings apart from the clothes we had on us. We worked hard and after 40 years we not only own a big house but are also debt-free and even though we could have made use of the welfare system over here, we didn't need to because despite our average education (basically high school) we all found some sort of job and worked our way up, step by step, helping each other where we could. 

So my question is: how come immigrants like my family, who didn't know the language, didn't have much help (other than a ""starter pack"" with some clothes and food stamps), average education and thus no advantages on the job market, etc. was able to achieve so much within half a life-time while others who have been much more privileged than us seem incapable of doing so? How is this entirely the system's fault?

To me, it seems like poor choices are part of the problem. 

There is no debate about billionaires exploiting people and not giving back, amassing wealth while the rest of the world suffers. And maybe most of the rich elite didn't do anything to deserve such a life in the first place. But if we assume that ""we"" (the less fortunate) deserve to be in their place, that seems rather weird. Why do we deserve more? What makes us more special or more worthy? I'll never understand that line of thinking.

Maybe UBI can solve these issues, but tbh if someone isn't able to handle their finances now, they won't be able to do so with more money either. There will always be people who are in need of more money because they are spending it on stuff that isn't essential, at least not right now. And I feel like a lot of people are just not being honest with themselves in that regard, justifying their financial decisions because they are already too invested in consumerism. Nevertheless, despite my pessimism in that regard, I will still support UBI whenever I get the chance because it seems the best solution for now, especially when automation is going to hit almost all professions in the near future.

I wish I had all the money on this planet so I could just give it to everyone to fill their lives with whatever they desire - but at the same time, I think that wouldn't solve the root cause, simply provide crutches until we figure out a better way to create a fair system. Though the question remains: what is fair and how much is a human's time worth? I don't think that can be answered without creating some sort of hierarchy where we start to put people into categories according to their value (which we already do in a way). Not sure if that's a good approach though since it is a great growth medium for division. We need to find better ways somehow."

Sure, some older games have provided a better approach here and there, but have had major flaws in other departments.

Maybe in 30 years, we will have more complex and much more realistic games that not just pretend to be complex but actually are, due to a variety of mechanics and systems that introduce *real* complexity and variety.

Until then, I don't think we should be too disappointed because things aren't going to change magically with some upcoming update. 

Maybe the devs are too busy with cosmetic overhauls, but I think the foundation of Stellaris (or any game for that matter) doesn't allow them to create realistic games as we desire. Even with an updated engine (Stellaris 2), I doubt they would be able to please us.

BeAmazed,ffe2r09,t1_ffe0nuu,1579835178.0,"Not arguing against this, just sharing my experiences/observations. Way too many people just seem to assume that almost all scientists are lazy fuckers who should work harder to educate the public - and I strongly disagree with that viewpoint.

The way knowledge is shared right now is suboptimal, but there also are several professions (e.g. science journalism) that are focused on that part. I think it's unrealistic to demand that every scientist should spend more time educating the population. Since you have a channel, I'm sure you know how much work it is to make those videos. And since you are active in academia, you also must know how limited time can be, depending on what projects you are working on. Depending on work schedule/environment, some people don't even have the time they need to prepare lectures properly - and that's what they are supposed to do. Sure, there are people not working efficiently - just like in any other job. But there also are plenty of people working hard, either because they have no choice or because it is their passion. While others are shitposting, scientists are solving real problems, day by day.

It's easy (and kind of ironic) to call people lazy and/or unmotivated, especially when sitting at home, waiting for the youtube feed to magically produce easy-to-digest content. 

People like you do exist and I'm happy for you, especially since you seem able to manage doing research, writing papers, prepare lectures, making educational videos and have a healthy private life. But I know many who simply couldn't do it - be it because they are bad at work/life balance or because they have different priorities. And imho there is nothing wrong with that.

The fact that publicly funded research is behind paywalls is related to this, but the root of that problem is not that scientists are too lazy to educate the public or because they don't care about sharing their knowledge (which seems to be the opinion many people share, even if they don't know anything about the conditions of working in research).

And tbh, I think it's really weird that some people's contribution to society is merely shitting on others 24/7 while creating a massive following - meanwhile, others are really trying hard to make things better and the vast majority doesn't even care because it's taken for granted. The way I see this, it's more about how entertainment is more valued than (in this particular case) scientific research. And maybe for some it is difficult to accept that most people aren't interested in the achievements of science in general, especially when working in all these different fields, trying to contribute in a meaningful way and still be dismissed because ""it's just another religion"" etc.

Apart from that, working as a researcher is usually a full-time job. These people hardly have the extra time to make youtube videos. Those who do are very rare and quite fortunate to be able to share their findings/insights on social media on a regular basis. Also, not everyone can work in science communication for various reasons.

In many (imho actually in all) cultures, mental health issues are still considered a weakness. These people will never get help, even if they suspect they might have mental health issues. 

Humans are great actors; deception and manipulation are skills we all have mastered to some degree. You don't have to fool the masses, all you have to do is fool yourself that you don't need treatment. I really believe the vast majority is capable of doing so. Plus, a lot of people have so many issues from various (childhood) trauma as well as struggles to survive in our societies, which might overshadow any symptoms that would be attributed to mental health issues otherwise.

Almost everything we do is about escaping reality. Taking a look at humans all around the planet, while our lifestyles may vastly differ, we all need a break from our daily struggles and we happily dive into any opportunity to do so, some more than others. If it's entertainment, drugs, religion, more work, etc. it's all about drowning the demons within us. We'd much rather spend an entire weekend doing whatever we think is important to our fragile existence instead of dealing with our mental health. Even the notion that mental health is only relevant when symptoms are noticeable is quite telling imho. The moment symptoms are obvious it's already ""too late"". You don't fix a house when it's about to fall apart, you continuously take care of it to avoid any substantial damage in the first place.

Just as we like to postpone dealing with massive global issues because we are waiting for some miracle to solve it for us, we like to postpone taking care of our mental health because we refuse to take it seriously. We'd rather pretend that we are fine and find more efficient ways to ignore it instead of being honest with ourselves and start taking care of our mental health.  

Additionally, if your entire existence is a struggle for survival, you probably won't have the time and resources to take mental health seriously. I'd argue that the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues is actually a luxury. It can only happen if you have time to breathe and take a break and realize that there is something wrong, despite all the positive aspects of your life.

Seven of Nine is one of my favorite characters because of her struggle with human concepts. For me, it was an entirely new concept/viewpoint that was explored with her transition and it also questioned our behaviors, morals/ethics, etc in a different way than the usual ""alien meets human and is confused about our customs"" theme. There is something quite novel about re-discovering humanity as a human who has been removed at a young age, growing up within a hivemind during the most relevant time of development that shapes us fundamentally in so many different ways.

Obviously, they only scratched the surface because it turned into fan service pretty quick, not really exploring the full potential of this character (and all the others for that matter), but I'm still not mad about the writing because at least they tried to implement something of substance unlike other writers.

I was more than happy to make room for someone more talented or at least more interested in performing live. Plus, I never liked being on a stage, all eyes on me. The quality of my performance never was impacted much by this, I just didn't enjoy the experience.

Several decades later, not playing live makes my passion much more enjoyable when all I do is making music all by myself. At this point, I'm not even interested in playing in garage bands anymore since it always gravitates towards making money sooner or later, which I'm not interested in. In a weird way I'd still love to perform live but at the same time I'm pretty sure I would not enjoy it after all these years.

Since my income does not rely on making music, there is no need for change. I'm not sure I can give any advice other than try to (self)analyse your situation and hopefully find a solution that makes you happy. The worst thing you can do with your existence is to waste time with something you don't enjoy."

There are also things we can't do but other species can. It's a matter of perspective, thus it's a subjective parameter. 

Also, the only reason we can be ""powerful"" is thanks to all the different organisms within us that ensure our body functions are carried out properly - without them, we would be struggling quite a bit. So at best, it's a team effort.

For example, without mitochondria we probably wouldn't be here - so I'd argue they are the most successful, most powerful and most exceptional things to exist, because they are almost everywhere on this planet, making sure life exists, not just humans.

EliteDangerous,fee3i53,t1_fedzyk9,1579025634.0,"There is zero demand for anything in this game because there is no real item/player economy in the first place - ""demand"" is just simulated and it works the same for all items. Also, mineral price changes did exist previously and did impact profits quite a bit - why do you think miners started to track fluctuations and pick asteroids regions based on nearby market sell prices?

If anything, the simulation of demand wasn't done right in the first place. It's just less obvious for other items due to the huge sell price difference (minerals vs other items). There certainly is a difference between items that can only be purchased and re-sold and items that can be generated (mined) indefinitely - something that wasn't really implemented with much foresight, especially due to lack of some sort of industry/crafting mechanic.

The problem is the underlying mechanics and how they interact with each other. Calling that a bug seems odd, especially since that's how the game was designed.

These terms can be used in a neutral way, but most of the time they are not. We humans crave the feeling of being special. Most cultures/religions are about us being the crown of creation and/or being the chosen people. There is a tendency to feel proud and/or exceptional/unique for simply being human which I find questionable. 

One can be fascinated by how things turned out for sure. But we were just very lucky to have the right set of genetic code to increase our ancestor's chance of survival which further paved the way to become a dominant species on this planet. I wouldn't describe this as an achievement or as a success because we really didn't put more effort into this than any other species because there is nothing any species can actively do to become powerful. 

I sometimes feel like people treat evolution like a game and humans are ""the best"" players, thus we must be amazing/exceptional because we beat every other species - but that's not how any of this works."

EliteDangerous,fedzmue,t1_fedrxg5,1579023246.0,"The term ""nerf"" (or ""buff"") just describes a certain type of change. 

The distinction between lack of balance and a broken mechanic is irrelevant imho, since in both cases a nerf (or a buff) is aiming to restore game balance from the perspective of the developer. 

As far as I know, mining mechanics (respectively related economy mechanics) weren't broken/buggy before - what made it *look* ""broken"" is the (still ignored) fact that other professions are massive time sinks with low profit margins. Frontier simply didn't expect people to dedicate so much time towards mining, nor to develop strategies to make it *that* profitable. So in that sense, the flaw wasn't bad code, it was the typical (and naively unexpected) result of humans solving problems with the tools they are provided with.

Before the change, we already had a ""realistic"" economy, it just didn't take into account the player's desire to seek out the path of least resistance (mining) instead of investing time into other content. 

With that in mind, the change clearly is a nerf because it ""reduces the [...] effectiveness of a particular game element."" 

A better change would have been to buff other professions so they are equally lucrative. But that way, people would acquire more credits faster, which would allow them to access certain game content with less time investment - something many devs are afraid of because without the grind keeping people busy, one would notice the lack of actual content ;)"

Maybe that's due to much more divided cultures but it has actually made things worse. Instead of dealing properly with racism, it has been slowly growing beneath the surface until it finally was less risquÃ© to voice these opinions in public. People refused to take neo-nazi movements seriously and refused to take the problems of these people seriously, resulting in more division and isolated social bubbles, as well as disappointment and resentment.

""Love the hate away"" also isn't what I'm suggesting, but there is something to be said about having a minimum of respect for any human being, no matter their attitude/actions. This includes listening to people and taking their issues seriously. Making fun of them is the opposite and quite counter-productive.

A lot of people are sympathizing with right-wing movements because they already feel left behind or even excluded for various reasons. That's why low effort arguments like ""immigrants are taking away your jobs"" work so well. 

However, these people have *real* issues and struggle with life in different ways and are constantly told that their fears or worries are silly or a product of their imagination. This has been going on for many decades and obviously, once someone comes along pretending to care about their situation and *also* providing an adequate scapegoat, they'll eat it up like delicious cake.

There is nuance to this *because* it's such a complex issue to begin with. Which means there also isn't a simple solution to ""disinfect"" people, especially when lumping them all together.

>these guys aren't open to being understood by others outside their group or realizing why their bigoted beliefs are wrong until the armor it provides has been cracked, and mockery is perhaps the most effective means of doing that. 

If you mock people you won't get far at all. It automatically results in a defensive stance and people will be more motivated to disregard your attempts to educate them. The reason why they refuse to listen or to have constructive discussions is because of their past and present negative experiences.

Plus, you are piling them all up by assuming ""these guys aren't open"" etc. You are basically doing what they are doing: oversimplifying and generalizing - to start any conversation with the attitude of ""you are all idiots"" or ""you are all the same"" won't get you far at all.

It would be interesting to know if you have ever had a constructive and calm conversation with a racist where you didn't try to convince them that they were wrong but simply giving them a chance to voice/explain their opinion to you. I know for a fact (more precise: anecdotal; based on observations of past 30 years) that many people fail horribly at this because they want to ""fix"" racism in 10 minutes. We don't need more preachers on high horses telling people what to think - we've had enough of those for centuries and look what a nice pile of shit it has produced."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcapuzl,t1_fcambqu,1577574197.0,"But the problem is that people don't differentiate anymore and label others based on one single characteristic, even though there is more to the table than just one single aspect. And that results in more division because people are being called X or Y, even though they may not be part of that group - or at least do not really see themselves as part of such a group until society forces them into that group.

If you call all Trump supporters racist, you only make sure that these people will never ever feel inclined to change their stance because they are being demonized for having a different opinion. Calling everyone racist left and right doesn't solve the underlying issues that are the root cause for such attitudes in the first place.

It is easy to call people racist and put all of them in one box and trying to suppress their ideas/opinions - but it's also not a constructive approach. There are better and more healthy ways to deal with racists as a society - long-term - and one of the first steps is to accept that these people are humans like everyone else and to accept that they all have very different reasons for developing their opinions.

I also don't think racism can be abolished or removed from any society as long as such worldviews are being ridiculed, dismissed or silenced. This very tactic has resulted in a distinct rise of right-wing movements all across Europe during the past few years - populism was just the cherry on top."
