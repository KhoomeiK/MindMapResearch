Due to his actions in WW1 and as defacto leader of the Philippines, he was an insanely popular general to civilians. Not so popular among his peers or superiors. 

The purpose, If I recall correctly, was two-fold, 1) to shut him up about being ""abandoned"" in the Philippines. As if the US government had a choice in that moment.  2) since he was a popular leader with the public, to turn the defeat in the Philippines into a PR win, tough, etc. Defense and great general to lead the defense forces long as it did.

No 

2)  has there been a hot, conventional world war?

No

3)  has nuclear proliferation caused major and minor actors to behave more peacefully after acquiring said nukes?

Yes

I'm not a library. The proof is all around you. 

no one said each and every nation or actor should have one; yet, those that have acquired them have reduced belligerance and created umbrellas of relative stability and peace.

You come with responses like 'well, I read this one story where we ALMOST had XYZ happen' 

And for the reasons I already stated, nothing ever happened and that's by design.

Example,

Cuban missile crisis: completely overblown and dramatized.  

What 99.9% of the people around the world didnt know. US Jupiter missiles stationed secretly in Turkey, in violation of accords being worked on between the US and USSR. 

Khrushchev wants them gone. He pushed the same game by stationing missile elements in Cuba. 

He knows what Kennedy knows and is confident that he will blink and he did because there is a simple, missing piece of information missing from public debate. 

Kennedy agrees to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey and the boats turn around heading to Cuba.

If it comes out that the USSR is playing brinksmanship because of the missiles, the US loses face and the risk the US doesnt remove the missiles becomes more a possibility. 

Since Khrushchev is in charge of an authoritarian state, he doesnt need an out. Kennedy does and he takes it. The 
Crisis sets political calls for treaties for limits and controls on nukes that ring through the 70s and 80s 


Everyone got what they wanted. USSR gets the short range missiles out of Turkey and eventually Europe. The US gets the USSR to the table to start drawing down the massive land-based mobile launchers of the USSR."

Considering the 1st major industrialized war with dumb fire technology cost the world 5% (probably higher because the influenza outbreak of 1919 was a side effect of the war) of its population during WW1

And 25 years later, another 5% of the world's population. 

Today, a safe estimate then follows that based on 7 billion people, a hot conventional war between major world actors would claim about 2.5% of the population directly, we're looking at 

175million people would perish in a world conventional war"
