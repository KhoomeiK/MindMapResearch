Write that you love her, miss her, and respect her need for keeping away and not visiting while you were locked up. Give your address, phone number, etc, and say you will be there, and you don't want anything from her except to let her know you love her. 

Then let her make the decision to contact you when she wants. Don't push."
JUSTNOMIL,fff8ceo,t1_fff2u8x,1579878243.0,"Start looking for loopholes to break the lease. Two freakin' years is too long to delay starting your independent lives out from under her control. Tell FIL if he doesnt sign off on breaking the lease, he too will be jettisoned when you put up big boundary walls with MIL. Tell him he has a chance to stick up for his son here, and you will be watching carefully how he handles it, because it will inform how you handle having children, and whether you will have a relationship in the future. 

Nuke it from space NOW before you get pregnant. You can always backtrack a little later if she proves teachable."

I just think they shouldn't try it. They've been given a ""See, you trying to dictate to us means we are fully prepared to set strict boundaries once we have a baby"" card to play. Concentrate on getting out from under any kind of control by MIL, and have all the dogs, cats, children that you want, that MIL sees maybe once every couple of months, if that."
JUSTNOMIL,fff6je4,t1_fff1qux,1579876979.0,"Stop spending any of your money or time in doing up the place, beyond what is covered in your rental agreement (mowing grass, etc).

JUSTNOFAMILY,ffcgayu,t1_ffbyrlc,1579798836.0,"It can be. It all depends on how the POA document is written. It can be written to give basically all control over, or be limited to certain decisions, like a friend had when he bought a house. He was out of town during closing, so his sister had a limited POA just for the signing of the closing documents."
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffcg4uz,t1_ffbkt2r,1579798732.0,"A POA would let his parents step in and change pediatricians, get their names added to all the children's records as being allowed to have unfettered access, be able to take the children out of state, you name it. It's basically ceding his parenthood. He's okay with that? 

Your problem is not with the inlaws. It's with your husband. If he was firmly in your corner, he'd be fending them off FOR you, and they wouldn't be so annoying, and now be sneakily trying to get legal control of your children.

But wait until you're calm to discuss this. You acknowledged you were doing something he feels uncomfortable with, and you apologized and promised you will stop doing it. There is no need for him to be flinging his mother's opinion of anything at you; you do not answer to his mother.  
Maybe ask him why him asking you to stop and you agreeing to stop was not enough ammo for him? He might have been embarassed by something his mother said to him about it. Tell him you want HIS honest feelings; not his mother's, because you're not in a relationship with her."

JustNoFriend,fe5uei9,t3_envm6p,1578875170.0,"After reading the previous post, and this one, there’s something about this friend that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It’s probably that in her inner monologue, she believes she is “Being Charitable” and then at times chafes under that setting. Whatever causes it, it sounds like she has an unhealthy way of relating to you. 

When things are good between you, does she share about HER life, and allow you to emotionally support her? When you try to be a good friend to her, does she let you? If not, I suspect she has you pigeonholed as a certain type of friend, and you won’t get that balance of power shifted; it’s been too long.

How is your new church going? Are you making any friendship overtures there? After living under an oppressive home for so long, I’m sure it’s hard to know how to start a new friendship on an equal footing."

Do you know where the piercing took place? You could also raise hell there, because they didnt get parental consent before doing it. If your mother had to sign something to get it done, they will surely produce it. If you have that, the police will also have potential fraud to investigate."
