It depresses me because my mind overthinks things to the max, plus a whole heap of life decisions/happenings that have seriously destroyed any feeling I've ever had of happiness, and that's made me go full circle. It affects almost every part of my life. 

However.
I'm using 2020 as a fresh start, it's a new decade and I'm wiping my own slate clean, I'm trying to forgive myself instead of blaming myself. 
Brother, I really hope you can consider something similar in the coming days, I know it's not that easy, believe me, but it's possible. 
I hope you the best, man."

I've only just seen your post about being banned but it's kinda lame that so many people can jump to the conclusion that you're ""obviously"" wrong and Blizzard are ""obviously"" right. It didn't seem that way to me through your post.
