popheads,ffptzwj,t1_ffn2uf8,1580105650.0,"Right here. 

This topic is one where, as a musician/producer, I feel like music **fans** (I really need to emphasize the word/idea of #*fans* here) really overvalue their own opinions, and it's a serious issue pretty much all genres that aren't pop/rap.

You probably don't give af how your plumber fixes your toilet, and you *especially* don't give af who made the part that the plumber used to fix your toilet. All you do is shit in it, and you're thankful for it. 

Now, pretend that the plumber's job was so completely misunderstood and over-romanticized that you *did* care.

And you can't enjoy your diarrhea  until you know that plumber hand-crafted each turn in the s-pipe of your toilet. Does this sound ridiculous yet?"

It's the music you listen to while you cry on the floor of your shower after you get broken up with. 

Like Praying by Kesha, it wasn’t supposed to win awards, it was about honesty. Honesty doesn’t win awards in pop music. 

That’s not **right**, but that’s the way radio airplay works. It’s shitty **sometimes**. This year, it’s amazing."

So if it didn’t work they can just draw up articles on conspiracy to abuse power. But since the money was argued to be held, it’s full on abuse of power."

apple,ffo6l07,t1_ffkk9t5,1580074644.0,Here to second this. Most recording studios won’t even have the computer in the same room as the mix engineer because they’re so loud. He has an absurd number of tracks going with a moderate amount of plugins. That’s amazing.

popheads,ffnrsfu,t1_ffnlhx7,1580069903.0,Melody writing is its own job a lot of the time when you work from a beatmaking approach (instead of a songwriting approach). It's called Top Lining. Ne-Yo made a career out of it before he went big.
