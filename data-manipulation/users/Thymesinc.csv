He wouldn't let her take it off because he said it would protect the shed, except the plastic was only ever intended to protect it during transit, not in outside weather conditions. The plastic melted onto the iron and peeled and split and she is forever trying to pick of the plastic that has now split into thousands of tiny pieces. It looks horrible."

selfimprovement,ffbdngz,t3_eso709,1579760886.0,Others will probably have better advice but if you can't quite get to self love try at least get to a neutral position. I noticed whenever I was stressed out or had to do a lot of overtime my self esteem and mental health would plummet. Once I worked out what was causing it when I felt myself spiraling I'd tell myself that I was not allowed to have an opinion about me until I had at least two nights of proper sleep and had gone for a 5k walk. Than not having an opinion on myself actually felt really great and I kinda just carried on with that.
selfimprovement,fehs2lo,t3_eozvoo,1579122752.0,"When it comes to second guessing if other people really are your friends, wow I feel you there! I started refuseing to read subtext, because I would spend so much energy second guessing other peoples intentions and couldn't believe that anyone really wanted me around. Now I take what people say at face value and everything is so much simpler. It was really hard to open up and trust like that but it has led to some great experiences and friendships. I've faced some rejection as well, got kicked out of my DnD group last year and got turned down by my crush but that's good and healthy too, we all get rejected sometimes and it's helped me trust that people will tell me if they don't want me around - which is actually kinda comforting.

I also gave myself permission to be a mess and do things imperfectly. Better to go out and do things badly than to not do them at all. I am such a perfectionist about things I really got myself into a rut of hiding away from social situations.

That's just a couple things that helped me, good luck and hey at least you are thinking about this stuff now and seeking out techniques to help. I'm sure if you keep working at it you can build up that confidence."
BDSMcommunity,fe46nrs,t3_enoqy1,1578856257.0,"Everyone's already given great advice and I personally started off wearing what I was comfortable with (circle skirt + bra + lacey top to hide arms) and just worked up to wearing less with every event. It helped that once I jumped into some group things I realised that lots of people looked like me and lots of people really dug me.
I have/had really low self esteem and while I can't always manage to be positive about myself I always strive to be at least neutral. Was kinda liberating to realise I didn't have to have an opinion on myself."

NoStupidQuestions,fdow3on,t1_fdok5lh,1578614210.0,"So you can call an inmate in prison, espesially  when they're newly in the guards know there are loose ends that need to be sorted out. I found the guards pretty helpful. 
You can also call if it's an emergency.

BDSMcommunity,fd4gssn,t1_fd493ya,1578167363.0,Yeh I think your right nd I definitely don't want to do anything unsafe. Thanks.
selfimprovement,fd0pefx,t1_fcztt0o,1578121975.0,"Thanks man, that's some really solid advice. It's nice to know other people go through it.

I really like the idea of actively being in control of my life despite all the negative thoughts, that's something I can do, or try and do. Plus applying the rational side to it as well, that's solid advice.

Thanks thanks, I appreciate it!"

BDSMcommunity,fclauie,t3_ehqnv1,1577743578.0,"I wanted to comment because I've recently been ghosted and boy do I empathize with you right now. Only my ghoster msgd me a month after our last convo, said he was sorry he hadn't contacted me and asked how I was. I replied asking him how xmas was and how he was, and he never replied to that! He just ghosted me again! What was even the point of msging me!

Anyway, that kinda made me decide not to waste any more headspace on it, there's no point in guessing at other people's motivations and assuming it was something I had done wrong was making it all about me and my ego."
TattooDesigns,fccl11l,t1_fcb6o6a,1577599621.0,"Thank you:) and you're right there is nothing to be ashamed of! Sometimes I need reminding of that! Hood luck with yours, I'm sure in the end you will get something you love. 
Oh I don't know if I said in my first comment but mine were vertical and I went with flowers with long stems and the stems kinda mimicked the scars, also something with geometric linework would look great and not completely cover them. Good luck with whatever you get <3 I hope it rocks."
TattooDesigns,fcb57br,t1_fcb0p85,1577582500.0,I felt that because he tattoo didn't completely cover them it just brought more attention to the scars. But I'm really confident that when I do get a solid coverup (firat appointment is in two weeks!) it's gonna hide it nicely so yeah I wish I had gone with that from the start.
TattooDesigns,fcab3gb,t3_egssf9,1577565945.0,"So I did the same thing you're planning - got a light line work tattoo that didn't completely cover the scars - and regretted it immediately. Now paying for laser and getting it fully/solidly covered up with a new tattoo which has all cost me so much money. 

For me my scars are almost two decades old, I no longer feel any emotional significance in them.  We're all different and definitely whats right for me isn't going to be the same for you but I just wanted to mention it to give you something to think about. Theres no need to rush either, take your time and think about how you might feel in twenty or thirty years. Right now I have a half lasered tattoo over top of self harm scars and it's a mess!"

We got pretty good at identifying what was in them from shaking them but you'd never really know if you were going to have a sweet or savoury dinner until you opened it."
