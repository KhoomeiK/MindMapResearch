Their are certain flying animals and even bugs from prehistoric times much bigger than they would be now because today's environment doesn't allow for animals of that size to exist anymore. The massive amount of oxygen in the air vitalized the body and made them huge. The less oxygen the earth has the weaker and smaller life will become. It's not even entirely certain how creatures like Pterodactyl's flew because everything we know about animal flight suggests it wouldn't be possible.

It didn't cause him pain, it was benign and was too big to cut off because if how much skin he'd lose so we'd just occasionally drain it. We all thought that was his biggest health concern. Turned out at the age of 13 he had late stage lung cancer and we only noticed because he started coughing blood. By the time we realized what was happening. They said they could do chemo but he was so old he might die from old age any moment. They could euthanize him and put him out of his misery. I knew there was nothing I could do. He was super old and he was clearly suffering a slow death coughing blood. I couldn't be in the same room when he was being put to sleep. I felt like a murderer even though this was the better option, everyone knew. But I had to step out of the building and breath. I felt horrible. I spread his ashes on his favorite area (along a river) on our favorite woodland trail. I even keep his tag and cremation tag on my Keychain.

The threat if violence is never an answer pure and simple. I can't explain it any better than this. How many people on the other side are going to see what you saw? Sure you saw the same people but what they saw is minorities gathering in the size of an army, armed as an army, storming a town and protesting angrily and loudly. Any person with a prejudice just had it confirmed. 

Your a Gun toting, naive child who believes in the power of firearms and force versus the power of human decency. You and the people in that protest are everything the people you were protesting against hates. You did nothing but confirm biases. The fact that you can't see that makes me fear for the future of this country. 

Guns more than ever are the subject of fear and oppression.
