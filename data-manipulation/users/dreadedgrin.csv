When you cast Fira, you fold and force the air onto itself. This causes the molicules to rub against each other and produce heat. If you do this too slowly, the swirling air will suffocate the flames and you get Aero. If you do this fast enough, the friction between the air particles will rip electrons from their atoms and you'll cast Thundra instead. But, if you fold the air just right, you get something special.

 

""Calling one. Calling All."" The messenger bellowed. ""Register for the tournament of the century. One-hundred years of fame! One-hundred years of glory! Riches beyond compare! Register before it is too late.""

 

I thought about joining the tournament. As a spellcaster, I would definately have an advantage over the other fighters. But it is not wise to rush into battle and I thought on the consequenses that could come If I joined. For example, I could be gravely injured. At best, even if I won I would create powerful enemies. I did not have a license to perform *any* spells, much less the ones that I created by myself. I would be branded as a witch  or as a dark sorcerer and the masters in the Capital would hunt me down. But, this *was* an officially sanctioned tournament. The strongest fighters would be offered a place in the king's guard. I decided that I wanted the job and I registered.

 

Most people never learn to cast anything other than Aero on their own. If you have the gold a good teacher will teach you Fira or Thundara. Blizzara is tricky; and so is Divine light. The hardest spells are taught only by the masters in the Capital. These masters are the keepers of the spells and they determine which techniques are safe for use and which are forbidden. They issue licenses for spellcasting, although unlicensed use is generally overlooked in the country or in times of emergency.

 

""Lords and Ladies, take your seats. Before you today are some of the fiercest warriors in the land."" The announcer hissed through crooked teeth. ""The final eight men or women standing shall move on to the semi-finals in the Capital! How exciting! Lets see what these competitors can do."" And with that, the little man, dressed in a garish purple costume rang the bell. Each warrior rushed to the center of the stage, trying for the best position.

 

I had been taught Fira by my grandfather. Nothing More. But from my mother I learned to dream. I learned that a good imagination eventually leads to quick wit, and wit to innovation. I kept casting Fira in new and different ways and accidentally taught myself Thundara. I kept doing this. Fiercer and more powerful my spells became. I eventually gained enough strength to cast Thundaga. And then... one day I cast the most powerful spell I had ever seen. One of the first of many techniques I would learn.

 

This is the spell that I started to cast. As the warriors clashed, one spotted me and rushed over. But it was too late. I released my attack.

 

When you cast Thundara or Thundaga, you move the air fast enough to seperate the electrons from the air. But what if you could completely seperate the atom from itself? You then have the power to create; the power to destroy. I called this particular version Mega-Flare. A blinding light and intense heat filled the stadium. No one saw it coming, nor could anyone react in time. Only the strongest could raise themselves from the dust. The remaining warriors turned to face me and in an instant I realized that they all had the same idea. Now, I would need to fight them all at once."

It was Daniel's job to watch. It had been so long, he no longer remembered why he had to watch nor what he was watching for. All he knew was that it was his job and that he was going to be good at it.

 

As the planet spun, Daniel could see all of the people of Earth. He watched as new humans were born, as they grew and as they fell in love. He watched humans start wars and pollute their planet. He watched them grow as they learned to solve their problems, as they built great cities and learned to travel into space. Daniel was only to watch, not to interfere in the matters of the earthlings. He was sure that someone somewhere had asked him to take notes once, but Daniel never did. After all, they would have given him a fancy pen, or a notebook if the notes were *that* important. So, Daniel watched, and that's all that he did.

 

Daniel leaned back against the soft ice. It was warm to the touch and very comfortable. He wondered if the humans would think the ice was warm. Daniel wondered a lot of things. Most of all he wondered what the humans would think of him if he could ever meet one. Daniel wasn't allowed visitors, and this was probably for the best anyway since Daniel had no furniture. All Daniel had was his endless expanse of ice. You would think they would have at least provided him with a recliner for all his trouble and years of service. Daniel guessed that this oversight was due to budget cuts. He couldn't remember if budget cuts was just a human problem, and there was a part of him that worried he wasn't going to be paid for this.

 

A plume of smoke appeared in front of Daniel and out stepped a woman wearing a green suit. Daniel knew that this must be one of the executives. He knew this because no working person would choose to wear such a hideous color. It clashed against the pink sky and the snow. Daniel wondered if she had ever even been out in the field before.

 

""Daniel two-five-five?"" The woman didn't even bother to look up from her clipboard. ""Corporate has questions about Earth, and an incident that happened at 250:09:098. Your presence is required in 30 minutes."" And with that, the woman dissappeared in another plume of smoke; almost as quickly as she came. Daniel straightened his tie and prepared his report for the board. He wondered if this was going to be a good time to ask about that chair."

""Good morning Gerald. I made you some pancakes. You like pancakes dont you?""

I sat up, still groggy and still half asleep. Part of me hoped that this was a bad dream.

 

""PANCAKES... PAN-CAAAKE"" Joann enuncated the words slowly, crawling closer and closer until she was on top of me. Both hands were on my chest.

 

""What time is...?"" I turned toward my alarm clock. It was 3 am. Far too early to be awake. Far too early for Joann.

 

""Honey, I dont think Gerald knows what pancakes are."" Greg interruped, pulling Joann off of me. *GREAT. Now both of my in-laws are here*

 

I got up, knowing that my day was already ruined. ""Morning Gerald."" Greg greeted me with a wide smile ""We are having pancakes. They're these small fluffy...""

 

""I know what pancakes are."" I interrupted.

 

""Great! So they have these where you come from?"" Greg produced a pancake from the pocket of his pajamas. I was dissappointed in myself for not being surprised by this.

""Of course we eat those in Canada.""

 

""You pronounce them  *'PANCAKES'* in America"" , Joann chimed in.

 

""Joan, I'm Canadian, not Slow"".

WritingPrompts,fecuzzf,t3_eohes3,1578985692.0,"To breathe life into a Death Knight a life must be given. Bones and flesh are torn away and replaced with mythril and molten steel. Eyes are wrenched from their skulls. The brain is augmented with cybernetics. But one is not truly a Death Knight until the final piece, the heart, is removed. Once you lose your heart you are no longer gnome. You are no longer alive.

Of course, no one willingly volunteered for the procedure. Usually, it happened gradually as body parts were lost to battle. Ironically, the Death Knight program was designed to keep our strongest warriors alive and healthy. Wounded combatants could be healed in a matter of days. However, it was unnatural. Slowly, you became more and more machine until you lost yourself. Those who had gone through with the surgery did their best to hold on to their humanity. Each piece of flesh became more and more valuable. But, no matter how much of your original body you had left, once your heart was gone there was no return.

I stayed by Astrid's side, waiting for her to awaken. I counted the minutes, dreading the moment that she would open her eyes. I couldn't bring myself to tell her of how she'd fallen in battle, of how she'd taken a spear through her breastplate. Most of all, I feared that she would never forgive me for what I had done. Though I had never seen a day in battle I too had become a Death Knight, for it was my heart that beat within her chest."

I ran but could not escape. With a snap of his fingers the man and the book disappeared in a plume of smoke and flame and reappeared in front of me.
