Redlining was STILL ongoing in Oregon [IN THE 1990'S.](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2014/08/roots_of_gentrification_how_19.html) That's a generation ago. That is a theft of wealth and opportunity that was intentionally enacted as official government policy. Policy that was made by white people, to the detriment of black people, on purpose.

The effects of this kind of thing **just. don't. disappear.** because they happened to your parents, or your grandparents. Your neighborhood had lower school funding. Your real-estate property, historically the primary driver of ascension to middle class status, was sytematically devalued. You had less to pass on to your children for an inheritance. Nothing to borrow against.

As I commented elsewhere, nobody who really engages with this stuff is going to tell you you should feel shame. They'll tell you it's about the responsibility we have, to right wrongs in our society. The shame thing is most often brought up by people who are arguing *against* accepting responsibility for structural racism."
