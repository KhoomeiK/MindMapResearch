Second: I highly doubt there's somebody in the entire state of New Jersey that has the license plate number which was actually written on the ticket because the parking officet mistook a number for a letter and the resulting license plate number written on the ticket is not in a format typically found on New Jersey license plates (normally they are [letter,letter,letter,number,number,letter] or [letter,number,number,letter,letter,letter], but the mistake made it [letter,letter,number,letter,letter,letter]).

baseball,ff3279m,t1_ff31lva,1579531740.0,">The Dodgers have led the NL West for 7 straight years, made the NLCS in 4 of those 7 years, and made the WS in 2 of the 7. They haven't won a ring in that time span. The Royals, on the other hand, made the postseason twice (2014 and 2015) in the last 34 years and have made the WS twice, winning it all in 2015.

In a way that kinda supports what I'm saying too, because LA has had that consistency that the prospects are supposed to bring but have no titles to show for it. You're right the postseason is a crapshoot, but sometimes you just gotta make those trades that give you the best chance to maximize your limited window. Does that mean it'll happen in this instance, probably not, but the idea isn't ridiculously far-fetched."
