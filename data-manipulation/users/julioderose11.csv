I know its not supposed to be like this since the cuppuchinoes i drink from established coffee chains retain their foaminess(?) until the very last sip. What mistake am i doing with the frothing of the milk to get this result, i would like to point out that the coffee machine im using is dripping water from the nozel and requires service for some time now but im not completely sure it has an effect on this specific problem."
