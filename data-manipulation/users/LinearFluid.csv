Second is a lot of States have enacted new laws as of 2018-19 that mandates a 10 year non replaceable battery smoke alarm. Check your State Regs.

Might as well do it now. 

NY Law as example.

sysadmin,ffe1s2p,t1_ffdzirt,1579834461.0,"I have one client that buys his own and he buys Thinkpads. No problem there as he is just 3 machines. But this means I only have limited experience but I know the first one He bought about 2017 was only 8gb single Channel. Confirmed through CPU-Z and Crucial's Memory Selector.

Here is the Crucial page for the Yoga Thinkpad 12 and it even says Non-Removable 8gb.  [https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-yoga-12](https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-yoga-12)

Looking further the YOGA line might be hobbled and the T400 series has 2 channel.

So I don't have experience with a lot of them but I can say I know first one was and I maybe looked at the second one which was single channel too and The 3rd I put in service this summer I never checked.

I also can not look at the specs right now on the ones I have to see which models."
