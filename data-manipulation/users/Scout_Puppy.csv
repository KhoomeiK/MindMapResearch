puppy101,ffi4qzm,t3_etq2ae,1579965040.0,"I think you are overthinking it. I have a field lab and he gets super exited when people engage him. His behavior consistently improved over the last few months and even now at 8.5 months when he is well behaved, people mention his huge paws and how big he's probably going to get. He's 60ish pounds and will probably gain 5-7 lbs max in the next year, but people still make the comment. It's small talk, I wouldn't worry about it."
puppy101,ffhe6q8,t3_etlt6y,1579931606.0,"Tips to make it easier. 

Use 1/2 of his kibble throughout the day to reward good behaviors, both active and inactive.

Concentrate on training 1 problem behavior at a time. If you see good improvement add a second one, etc. 

Write down good things your puppy did every day. 

Manage home environment. If the pup has no access to inappropriate items he can't damage them. 

Hit crate training hard. It makes it so much easier. 

Puppy safe chew items like bully sticks can help to occupy them and give you a breather."

dogs,ff8j5g6,t1_ff8g5is,1579680901.0,">So if there is always a hierarchy - this alpha is the most dominant, then this beta, and then this omega - why do some relationships not show doninance at all?

Human intervention. Just like human influence can modify and inhibit certain natural behaviors, human influence can cause disruption of natural formation of linear hierarchy. Dominance doesn't have to be aggressive or violent either. Preemptive submission establishes rank in non confrontational way. 

The second study's conclusion gives a possible reason for more varied behavior. 

>""The dogs in this study associated in semi-permanent groups, all were
neutered, and they did not compete for food. Humans actively prevented competitive encounters, humanely punished aggression, rewarded tolerance
and excluded more aggressive dogs from the social environment. Yet, de-
spite these multiple mitigating factors, agonistic relationships were highly
unidirectional, significantly linear, and similar in nature to those reported for
other groups of dogs and wolves. This indicates that dominance is a robust
component of neutered companion dog social behaviour. On the other hand,
many dyads in the study did not show detectable dominance relationships
(there was low coverage), suggesting that human involvement can reduce
the tendency for neutered companion dogs to engage in agonistic encounters
and form dominance relationships. Overall, dominance appears to be appli-
cable to some, but not all, relationships among neutered companion dogs.
When dominance relationships are present among dogs (neutered, intact,
and/or feral), they tend to be expressed primarily though affiliative displays
of submission on the part of the subordinate rather than dominant displays
of aggression on the part of the dominant."" (p23). 

So humans are able to cause significant change in natural canine behavior which is not new. If one dog avoids a dominant dog that harasses it and that dog is removed into timeout. The avoidant behavior is reinforced through negative reinforcement and dominant behavior is reduced through negative punishment. 

Another possible explanation for lack of interactions is that some daycare dogs do not view other dogs as their pack. So participating in hierarchy determining rituals is not viewed as necessary."

dogs,fen31rf,t3_eq1ps7,1579275866.0,"First, since you just got her look into 2 week shutdown which will help her to settle into her new life. Also most dogs will be ""well behave"" for the first week or so after which point their true personality will begin to show. Your dog might continue to be well behaved or she might start showing other undesirable behaviors. Just be prepared for that possibility.

Second her howling in her crate when you leave is a mild form of separation anxiety. Something to occupy her when you leave like a frozen kong would work. I'd stay away from PB though. It's high in fat and salt. I used plain frozen greek yogurt for my pup.

Third for humping, I wouldn't reprimand her, she doesn't know what's appropriate behavior yet. Teach her a game such as tug of war or chasing a ball and redirect her to that game. If she continues to hump, keep her on a leash when your bf comes home. When she humps him, have him step away out of her reach and turn away from her without any engagement. After 30 seconds or so have him reengage. Repeat for 3-5 reps a session. If she doesn't hump at any point during the session give her a treat and lot's of praise."

My pup was sniffing something and I called his name to see if he'd look at me so I could recall him. He didn't look up, no biggie the environment was too distracting at the time. 

An old dude with a very old dog came up and advised that you gotta be loud and authoritative for the dog to listen. He bellowed his dog's name and the poor thing got startled and it looked like all life got sucked out of it. Low to the ground, tail between legs, almost cowering. My pup didn't even glance his way.

Trying to treat a symptom of insecurity, growling because the dog wants to protect something that it values is counterproductive. Teaching a dog that it shouldn't fear loosing things it values because it will be better for the dog in the long run is a better way.

You never punish growling or other warning signals, because dog can learn that showing those signals does not work and might default to attacking without warning.
