Step 2 - tell the nurse you are a fainter, they will likely adjust your position to accommodate a sudden drop in blood pressure.
Step 3 - have an interesting anecdote to tell the nurse having explained you need to talk in order to get your mind off it
Step 4 - do not focus on the concept of drawing blood, it’s just a tiny scratch from a tiny kitten
Step 5 - after make sure you are cool, be honest to the nurse if you don’t want to get up.
Step 6 - explain you are going to sit down somewhere and wait 
Step 7 - put on some tunes, have a nice cup of tea and ....“ have a cookie, I promise you, by the time You’ve eaten it you’ll feel right as rain. Don't worry about it. As soon as you step outside that door, you'll start feeling better. You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap”"

There is payback though and if it’s done without malice it’s great! My brother takes great pleasure in reciting all the crap my old Dad used to say to us kids. For example he will grab my Dad by the back the neck pull him him close and whisper in his ear “Don’t embarrass me boy or you will regret it” this is especially funny if we are at a nice restaurant. It’s sounds mean doesn’t it, but Dad gets the joke and laughs with us. He says some mean sh*t about me and my brothers hair loss when he is as bald as a coot. I coach my son with smack talk for Grandad when he comes out with comments about girlfriends clothes and school work. It’s great to see the old fart get shutdown before he can get started. Bless him, he’s a mean old turd but we love him."

Blending will take some practice to get right but it doesn’t look too shabby. I will try and post a side view.

bald,fe6rudj,t3_enqieo,1578902418.0,"There’s a girl in my team at work who is thinning on top. She wears her hair in a ponytail but most days it slips to the side and it shows. This might be sexist to say but I have a feeling that women would be more affected by this kind of change in appearance. I’m not saying that men aren’t affected by depression or anxiety or even vanity, I just think that the ladies do spend more energy on appearance and perhaps they judge themselves more harshly than a man would in this particular scenario of hair loss because it’s expected in men.
Anyway I empathise with her and I hope that my own approach to hair loss hasn’t made her feel bad.
I could never speak to her about this."
