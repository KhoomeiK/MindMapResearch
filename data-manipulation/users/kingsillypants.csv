Your problem isn't that Facebook is shitty,  it's that I'd tou have a problem,  it's your friends and family that are. 

When the  car was invented , people didn't give out about the car being used for nefarious purposes or that the inventor of the car should dictate traffic laws, that's what government is for. 
 And if all your friends do is use cars for shitty purposes, that's not the cars fault, just crappy friends.
