So, “constantly forcing himself to do the difficult or even dangerous thing,” he gradually was able to cultivate courage as “a matter of habit, in the sense of repeated effort and repeated exercise of will-power.” Though only a mediocre horseman, he volunteered to ride “mean” horses, those liable to buck.

The US military should *easily* have foreseen the outcomes of both the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, and should have been able to avoid two humiliating and unnecessary military defeats.

The US military is no different than any other institution, corporate, church or state, that any intelligent reasonably cautious person should not trust explicitly.

We trust these institutions (I believe) because our very first loss of trust was a loss of trust in *ourselves*.  We have been systematically taught not to think, not to reason, not to write, not to read, not to study, not to strive for perfection ... to get by, using whatever means is necessary (to accept that ""the ends justify the means"").

We learned not to trust in ourselves; our principles became subject to manipulation by propaganda and fear-mongering.  We were told we could no longer afford morals or honor.  And we believed that lie. We accepted that lie; that we couldn't trust *ourselves*, that we couldn't trust in our own moral conscience or in our courage to adhere to it, no matter what.  Now we trust institutions instead.  Ok.  That works when those institutions honor, respect and uphold our trust.

canada,fdl2ii5,t1_fdl1sy9,1578515954.0,"I'm only saying that I made the right decision moving to Canada 14 years ago.  Without any doubt and without any regrets.

Canada's excellent single-payer system of universal health care is NOT the reason I moved here.  Without it, though, it is unlikely I'd have been able to make the move.

In other words, it represented a ""freedom"" from fear and insecurity.  What would YOU do with your life if you didn't have to worry about health insurance?"
canada,fdkytoa,t1_fdkycht,1578513968.0,"  
The Canadian single-payer health care system is often criticized for long wait times for non-emergency medical procedures.  It is true that any non-emergency surgery, though, is likely to put you on a waiting list.  But in an emergency – a real emergency – you go straight to the head of the line, if your doctors says you need a procedure; you get it.  Without waiting.

In Canada, medical decisions are left entirely up to doctors, and there are no requirements for pre-authorization whatsoever  If your family doctor says you need an MRI, you get an MRI.  I did, immediately, in August 2012, after an accident.  No ""waiting list"".  In the US, if an insurance administrator or HMO rep says you are not getting an MRI, then you're not getting one regardless of what your doctor thinks — unless, of course, you pay for it out of your own pocket.  Which is why far more Americans are paying for necessary medical procedures out of their own pockets than there are Canadians who find it necessary to do that.  

It happened to me after a severe concussion four years ago. An emergency room doctor called a New Brunswick hospital, and I got an immediate appointment for an MRI the following morning. Straight to the head of the line. My ""ability to pay"" was not a consideration. 

A doctor made that decision; not an insurance company."

She argued that capitalism, unchanged, unregulated, is the *cause* of the climate crisis, and that no one understands this better than the fossil-fuel industry funded denialists, who will fight the systemic changes required to the bitter end.  Because it changes their world.

In that editorial, Naomi Klein argues that, ironically, it is the fearful predictions of the hard-right deniers that are the most realistic solutions to the crisis, that a fundamental restructuring of the system is necessary and that the real denial is the belief that the crisis can be averted by gradualistic feel-good measures like ""buying green products"".

In other words, don't simply change YOUR world, change THEIR world.

Quoting Naomi Klein:

>“Here is where the deniers have good reason to be afraid: arriving at these new systems is going to require shredding the free-market ideology that has dominated the global economy for more than three decades. What follows is a broad strokes look at what a serious climate agenda would mean in the following six arenas: public infrastructure, economic planning, corporate regulation, international trade, consumption, and taxation. For hard-right ideologues like those gathered at the Heartland conference, the results are nothing short of intellectually cataclysmic.”

That editorial was reprinted in full in Naomi Klein's 2019 book [*On Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal*](https://www.google.com/search?q=On+Fire%3A+The+Burning+Case+for+a+Green+New+Deal) which (as much as I hate this phrase) is a ""must-read"".
