gaming,fffgeup,t1_ffff43t,1579883396.0,"I think Dishonored would fit with what you want really well.  It doesn't have grinding, has a great story, is below 20hr.  The story is linear.  Each chapter has a set of just a few objectives and it doesn't really have side missions.  You also have the option of being lethal or not kill a soul so it can be really fun to have different play styles to fit you."
gaming,fffcacy,t1_fff83of,1579880803.0,Definitely try it! It is not a big game at all.  Both 1 and 2 are fantastic campaigns and all the DLC and lore in the game are fantastic! It is essentially a straight-line campaign but you can also get lost in the lore if you really want

aww,ffew4cy,t1_ffev3fz,1579868008.0,"Yes they do.  The zoo had no option in the Harambe accident.  A child, who was not listening to signs, parents, fences, and warnings jumped into the pit of a gorilla who, [wasn't being aggressive, rather defensive to the child but was being very rough, dragging them through the water by their leg and could at any provocation crush the child like a tin can.](https://www.wlwt.com/article/full-video-boy-falls-into-gorilla-world-exhibit-at-cincinnati-zoo/3265123#)  Darts wouldn't be effective due to adrenaline being up and the time it takes for the sedation to kick in -- which could cause the gorilla to harm the child in the mean time.

science,ffbxb66,t1_ffbn6l7,1579785786.0,"The problem is time-scale.  It takes decades for a tree to store back all that carbon, in the mean time all that carbon was released essentially instantly into the environment.  Yes, plants regrow re-store the sequestered carbon but it will take way longer than it took to release it"
science,ffbwbd4,t1_ffbuq5e,1579784905.0,"Global warming isn't instantaneous, scientists have been predicting global warming for a long time but that doesn't mean it isn't real.  They predicted it, saying it will happen and we should mitigate it, now were are really starting to see the effects: [increased global temperatures](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/13/supplemental/page-4), more fluctuating weather, more and intense [tornadoes](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tornadoes/201013), [droughts](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/southwest), [melting sea ice](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/), [raising sea level](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/), [floods](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-coastal-flooding), [fires](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2830/six-trends-to-know-about-fire-season-in-the-western-us/), [coral bleaching](https://gci.uq.edu.au/climate-change-threatens-survival-of-coral-reefs), [higher atmospheric and aquatic CO2](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Quality+of+pH+Measurements+in+the+NODC+Data+Archives), [toxic algal blooms](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Frequency-of-occurrence-of-harmful-algal-blooms-during-the-last-century_fig4_236142114).  I'm sorry but which one of these ""debunks"" global warming""? They are far from debunked, it is literally happening.  And in case you try to call out my credentials I worked 4 years in a climate research lab studying the effects of warming on ecosystems.  The earth is literally a positive-feedback loop.  Increased termperatures melt sea ice, causing floods.  Increased CO2 levels cause higher oceanic CO2, lower oceanic pH leading to coral bleaching and higher oceanic CO2 leads to toxic algal blooms.  Higher temperatures mean drying of plants leading to increased fires and droughts.  Higher temperatures mean more varied atmospheric temperatures leading to shifts in wind patterns leading to more and stronger tornadoes and more varied seasons, more unpredictable weather.  Raising sea levels mean stronger tropical storms.  Its called the runaway greenhouse effect.  Scientists have also been predicting antibiotic resistant bacteria for a while now and that is true too.  We are hurdling toward antibiotics not being useful.  Just because you have heard a prediction for a while does not negate the truth or severity of that prediction."

politics,ff5sodw,t1_ff4duo1,1579608756.0,"The Senate is literally there to represent the rural minority, just as the House represents the urban majority.  Its the whole point of that check and balance, a dual-house Congress to represent the needs of both urban and rural states so neither unilaterally controls everything.  I am by no means saying I agree with them but thats the point of the Senate is to represent the minority"
politics,ff5sdzv,t1_ff5h8z8,1579608438.0,"The whole idea is that rural states have different needs than urban states.  By proportioning the votes in the EC you can represent those needs better, that way the urban states aren't the only ones controlling the government.  The problem is the winner-take-all system.  There needs to be ranked voting and the EC needs to be proportional within each state (if candidate A gets 75% of the state's votes, they get 75% of the EC and so on).  Many states right now have winner-take-all EC votes so even if a candidate gets 51% of the votes, they take all of the EC votes which is just stupid, they should get roughly half the EC votes for that state"

WTF,ff2ppga,t1_ff1ot1e,1579518245.0,What the heck are you talking about u/pancreative2? Bleach absolutely does not breed a super mold.  Nothing is getting resistant because of bleach.  Bleach works by oxidizing literally every biological molecule.  Nothing is getting resistant to that. Source: I am a microbiologist working in a cancer lab.  It is standard lab practice to bleach all biological materials for 20 minutes in 20% bleach.

microbiology,fdqd6j4,t1_fdqbftx,1578663519.0,"This is impossible to identify anything or even tell if it is alive -- not to be harsh. Try some of these tips to help
1) the picture is way out of focus, practice getting a clearer image by playing with the focus
2) you pan the camera way too much. For identification, focus more on a single specimen or two instead of trying to grab a bunch in the video
3) usually more than just a microscope image is needed to identify unless it is algal or protists in general which have more phenotypic qualities
4) if it takes 1000x to see, if it is indeed alive most likely it is bacterial which is impossible to identify from a scope image, you need stains and biochemical tests at the minimum. Be careful too because movement doesnt mean alive at that size as Brownian movement from water molecules can cause littering in debris -- look for directional movement."

aww,fdn9yhi,t1_fdmpduj,1578581164.0,"HOAs are organizations typically in charge of those stereotypical suburban cul-de-sacs.  They often manage the neighborhoods (ie mowing, park maintenance, etc).  They are often run horribly and have terrible rules such as requirements on what you can do with your house/yard.  Homeowners in these neighborhoods pay fees to the HOA but lose a lot of freedom.  Often, conveniently, these rules also don't apply to HOA board members (ie YOU can't build a shed, but Shannon on the board can!)."
