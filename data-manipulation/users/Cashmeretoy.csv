todayilearned,ffweds4,t1_ffvp20d,1580297776.0,Some of that that uplifting happened in the wake of labor laws changed after Carnegie's time.  This thread is about a man who hired goons to rough up strikers. Get some perspective before trying to claim nothing can be done to improve a capitalist system.

Anyone who tries to portray that as being some consequence of social media is ignoring the fact that this type of social interaction has existed much longer than the internet has. Same with companies covering their ass by firing someone if they even suspect something they said or did might be considered scandalous by society."

television,fdvmm84,t1_fdsgnww,1578749093.0,"I don't think the show needs to be structured to cater to it's least attentive viewers. Personally I think cards for ever jump would be pretty distracting and offset the pacing. A timestamp would have less impact in pace but still be a distraction. Knowing when the stories took place relative to each other is enough for me, and trying to place specific dates on a timeline would honestly have me less focused on the story."
television,fdvkkix,t1_fdsfjg6,1578748429.0,"It's just that a lot of the timeline criticism just seems like people weren't paying attention and blame the show for it.

classicwow,fdoktb1,t1_fdo68i4,1578607158.0,"It's more complicated than other loot systems that are more commonly used and have add-on support. A simple sheet may not be particularly complex but it's more complex than a system that is mostly automatic.

classicwow,fdl7t3p,t1_fdl55l4,1578518510.0,"Tbh I get pretty annoyed by the random tells from strangers when I'm on my warrior but having a summons available can definitely make a difference. Even if I'm not interested it's less annoying than being asked to tank something that will take me 30+ minutes to get to. And sometimes if I'm kinda just fucking around it's enough to get me to say ""Sure let's do it""."
classicwow,fdkzx80,t1_fdk2qdd,1578514579.0,Also he is complaining that someone publicized an exploit he liked so it got fixed. Honestly surprised at how many anti-exploit comments are getting down voted.
classicwow,fdkzb1q,t1_fdirweu,1578514255.0,"Maybe I'm just reading too much into it but it sounds like you are complaining that an exploit was fixed. Partly because the only private forums like you mentioned that I saw back in the day were basically exploit repositories. Things like item duping, ways to force a server crash, getting outside the game world. Also tips on how to steal accounts. Maybe you knew some less scummy underground forums."
classicwow,fdkyion,t1_fdkjg6z,1578513786.0,"The value of being knowledgeable was always inversely proportional to the group's overall knowledge. Being the one guy who knew the way was just like you said. Got plenty of compliments for being a ""good tank"" in Strat UD back in the day for just not fucking up pulls; I was really just a fury warrior with a shield who knew how to taunt and pull correctly. 

The flip side is if everyone knows the way your knowledge isn't really valued and people care more about the numbers you out out. Though that's more variable depending on the individuals in the group ranging from the rager complaining about heals when nobody is dying to the people who dgaf and keep killing shit when it seems like the warlock is afk following with just the imp doing damage. I personally like the groups where people compliment someone doing really well but don't mention it if someone is a bit subpar."

funny,fdkqnxx,t1_fdknfmw,1578509139.0,"You seem a bit worked up about this. I'm not ""bitching and moaning"". You say you are trying to be helpful but to be perfectly honest you are coming across as judgemental this deep in the thread. Your first post with some suggestions for answers certainly is useful for some jobs. People just pointed out that not every job teaches new skills and you seem to be unwilling to agree with that.

I, and others, have been trying to point out that for some people a job at Walmart doesn't offer anything other than money. That isn't a mindset thing, sometimes that's the cold reality. Your perspective, at least what I can gather of it from your posts, seems to be that there is always something to be learned. Which means you can argue with everyone else in this thread forever and never agree because you are telling people that their experiences aren't real. Some people take jobs to survive and try to improve themselves in their own time and personally I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Additionally, most of the people in this thread are not saying to actually do what the guy in the comic is doing. It's amusing because it's stating how a lot I people feel when that question is asked.

I hope I don't come across as too much of a jerk with this post. Like you I'm just trying be helpful, but intentions aren't everything."
funny,fdkk2wj,t1_fdih9m9,1578505281.0,So which is it? Is it not how hiring actually works or is it a bad hiring practice that is actually employed by some businesses that leads to high turnover? Because both cannot be true at once.
funny,fdkjezq,t1_fdio7gq,1578504958.0,"When you are at the point of ""I need a job, any job, so that I can eat"" those additional reasons aren't at all part of your decision making.

classicwow,fdi8ps9,t1_fdgd8rr,1578437750.0,Sc also takes longer than the piecemeal option. If you think you have a slot lined up in a raid I'd go for the devilsaur and whatnot version because chances are you will be in a few pieces of raid gear long before finishing your SC pre-bis setup.

classicwow,fdi1cxx,t1_fdhph4m,1578434005.0,"Playing efficiently matters if someone feels they are falling behind due to the amount of time they play. If they have goals that they feel they are falling behind on, but their game time isn't being used effectively to progress towards those goals, then playing inefficiently is contributing to them not enjoying the game.

Not wanting to minmax or optimize your time is fine as long as you accept that it will impact how quickly you attain your in game goals. Frankly some people hold mutually exclusive goals, and lash out at others when those conflicting goals can't be met."
classicwow,fdhyk67,t1_fdhpywf,1578432507.0,"A lot of the value in guides is in explaining systems that the game intentionally obfuscates. If you don't get any outside information (whether from guides or other players) you will be ignorant of how certain systems work.

The issue is mostly border agents given more room for what is considered ""reasonable"" search and seizure. It's also not something I'm dedicated to staying up to date about so policies may have changed since the last time I read about it. That said, here are some articles about it.

This article gives a bit of a summary of the issue, including the policy that promotes it: https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/01/05/new-dhs-policy-on-demands-for-passwords-to-travelers-electronic-devices/

AskReddit,fdgb041,t1_fdg5iqo,1578387913.0,1 sounds useful until it starts being used just because it's allowed rather than because there is actually suspicion someone is involved in something illegal. US has had enough issues with passwords being demanded without a rule like that being in place.
AskReddit,fdgaod3,t1_fdfrywj,1578387445.0,"Hate to break it to you but that happens in the US too. Though you won't necessarily be charged, people have been detained because of refusal to provide passwords. More of an issue with customs at airports and border crossings."
AskReddit,fdgacou,t1_fdg34kz,1578386990.0,"There's really no way to know definitively if he's racist or not. Saying racist things are ""just a joke"" is a pretty classic defense employed by actual racists when confronted. So unless you are psychic it's just a matter of choosing to believe him or not.

classicwow,fdfhdtf,t1_fdaggbi,1578361737.0,"I get that min/maxing isn't for everyone. I really wish that people who don't care for it would stop thinking of it as something done at the expense of fun.

There is no game mechanic in WoW that had ever been effective at making people who don't actually want to be social have meaningful interactions. Shallow interactions like a quick grouping for a quest are made more meaningful by extra effort players chose to expend, not some mechanic that drives them to interact more."
worldnews,fdeqdpu,t1_fddhhw6,1578344425.0,You are just fooling yourself if you think that's the case. Plenty of his supporters aren't on Reddit. I have the misfortune of knowing some and at this point they basically don't talk politics with anyone they know doesn't agree. They feel attacked if you try to refute Trump rhetoric so they just don't bother.
worldnews,fded6wk,t1_fddddo1,1578336455.0,"Specifically referring to Jade Helm there was no reason to believe it was some nefarious thing. There's a big difference between fearing someone with hateful rhetoric will follow up on it with hateful acts and believing a military training excercise is a secret plan to have the federal government take over southern states because the president is secretly evil.

Like honestly the Jade Helm theories were far crazier than what Trump is actually doing now. Because as tragic as it is, you are right that there is precedent for Trump's camps."

classicwow,fdd0rg2,t1_fdb0n1c,1578290275.0,"Enjoying the game and beating the game are not mutually exclusive. Some people like to get as much performance from their character as they can, and that is not a thing that is new to gaming or that has arisen since it became more mainstream. Minmaxers have been a subset of gamers since long before Warcraft existed. They are probably a greater proportion of the Classic player base than they were in Original WoW just because there is less reason for Exploration or Story focused gamers to come back to Classic. You can't truly recapture the feeling of discovering a certain area for the first time, or getting the story of an are by doing it's quests.
