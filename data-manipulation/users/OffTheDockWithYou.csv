Pete_Buttigieg,fgk2o3w,t1_fgk2iy4,1580856228.0,Yeah that’s what I thought. Preposterous. Not giving it any attention.
Pete_Buttigieg,fgk2i3x,t1_fgk1dbw,1580856132.0,"About ten minutes ago MSNBC had Pete in the lead by basically identical percentages with 91% reporting. Even if the gap between 60-something and 90-something reporting made Bernie pull ahead, it shows that Pete wasn’t being egregiously off for saying it looks like he won."

Any shenanigans like that would be uncovered instantly by the literal dozens of actors interested in squashing Pete’s campaign, so spreading “rumors” is about as smart as spouting some 911 “Truth”"
