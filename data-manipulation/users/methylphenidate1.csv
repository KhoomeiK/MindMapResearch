Anyways I walk up there and the stall in this bathroom has a lock that only locks if you Jimmy it the right way, I look through the crack between the door and the stall (it's one of those big wheelchair accessible stalls) at the toilet and don't see a shadow or shape occluding the toilet so I assume it's empty and open the door and waltz in and lo and behold there's a guy standing up beating his meat in the far corner, I hoped the fuck out"

So what you're saying is that God doesn't differentiate between people like Hitler, Stalin or Pol Pot, and some awkward 13 y/o that jacked off in a Walmart bathroom?"

Christianity,fg2sz40,t1_fg2rzbc,1580454607.0,"I've been put under general anesthesia twice in in my life, I find it very difficult to reasonably conclude that death will be any different than that, but I suppose I'm a fool for hope, I like to think that maybe there's something beyond death, but a god that sentences people who have lived decent lives to eternal torment simply because their process of reasoning is cruelty incarnate."

SuicideWatch,ffiq3md,t3_etrvgs,1579979910.0,"Honestly man, kind of in the same situation as you, I'm 21, been on dates, still a virgin (although I lie to anybody I talk to about it in irl because it's socially unacceptable in this day and age) I'm in the second year of my engineering degree, I'll probably be 25 or so by the time I graduate, so I'm just focusing on improving myself right now, once I graduate and have a little more time and money, I'm gonna start hitting the gym. I'm also fairly picky, I want to have a meaningful relationship with whoever I have sex with, it's better to be alone and a virgin than to be in a destructive relationship. Just taking one look at my parents marriage is enough to teach me that. It does take a toll on me and I feel lonely and starved for a human touch but in the spectrum of human suffering, it's pretty mild, think if the Wehrmacht soldiers freezing to death in Stalingrad knowing they're never see home again or the millions who suffocated in the Gass chambers, or those who died of starvation and exhaustion in the gulags. Sure my life isn't perfect and I'm sad because I've never had a gf, but that's a mote of dust in the wind compared to what many people have experienced. I have a warm bed, a functional, healthy body, enough to eat, and most of all I have a purpose, and that's enough to get me through the day.
Thanks for coming to my ted talk."
AskReddit,ffgh0zz,t3_etcyd6,1579906045.0,"I think life is just too shitty and stressful, women have more frequent attempts, men use deadlier methods. So it's not necessarily a sign of increased mental distress in men. Personally if I ever decide to get it done with I'll use a gun, don't want to be put on a kidney transplant list for a suicide attempt, I'd deserve it less than an alcoholic at that point"
