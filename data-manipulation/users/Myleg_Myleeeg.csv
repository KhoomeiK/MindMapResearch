NZXT,fglf7t9,t1_fggvpd4,1580894648.0,It’s ridiculous that after so many years their is still the same god damn issue. How they get you is that you need to use the software for your lighting and settings. I’m sure theirs NOOO way they could’ve had those setting be stored on the device itself to always start up exactly how you want it.
MovieDetails,fglbrsw,t1_fgka9ym,1580889811.0,If captain americas suit was either they would’ve made a bigger deal out of it to sell more toys
dankmemes,fgju3nh,t1_fgjt66h,1580851421.0,"Lol you’re kidding right? AI software engineer Job at tesla is less than 100k. Sure maybe for some other positions if you want to be pedantic and talk about a position irrelevant to the topic at hand. Shit let me link the Glassdoor results next time just to be really accurate, how’s that?"
dankmemes,fgj1bz4,t1_fgiw4dx,1580835099.0,100k plus a year in slave wage. Shit man.

MovieDetails,fgirozs,t1_fgio84q,1580829407.0,That level of understanding is more than enough to notice that two jungles are the same.
MovieDetails,fgirhej,t1_fgiidm5,1580829270.0,The thing is they reused the same exact scene not just the objects. That’s what’s weird.
dankmemes,fgircao,t1_fgir5v3,1580829177.0,Another idiot that thinks payed work is slavery? I’d say all of reddit has more of a serious issue with bitching at anyone who is more successful than the people on this website. Which is a very low bar by the way.
MovieDetails,fgir6bp,t1_fgikcfa,1580829067.0,Lol thats not how that works. You model the whole object you don’t just cut it in half. Especially when you want the rendering engine to render it well and have all the shadows look right and not cut in half. Where they would cut is anything outside the boundary of the camera frame taking into account  camera moves. They really could’ve just moved around the object at the very least it wouldn’t taken maybe 1 hour tops. Add a change of lighting and the scene would’ve felt completely different.
dankmemes,fgiof6x,t1_fgiljyq,1580827195.0,As a redditor he speaks with absolute certainty about things he’s read about. What more could you want?

MovieDetails,fggxpl8,t1_fggd826,1580771912.0,Lol fuck you for saying 3D has no effort or love. You have no idea what goes into making those things. I hate how many people share your belief.
vfx,fgbsrkx,t1_fgbr7ix,1580665771.0,Ok? Houdini simulation get brought into and rendered in maya. Don’t just spout out a random software you know hoping it’s applicable. Makes you look ridiculous. The fact is maya is used all over the industry and refusing to take a job that uses that software is ridiculous.
NoStupidQuestions,fg7ppfq,t1_fg7o3ya,1580598362.0,Claiming that you don’t have an inner monologue when you do is what everyone is finding ridiculous. He’s not saying he thinks differently he’s saying he has no form of inner monologue at all.
