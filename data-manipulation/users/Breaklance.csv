totalwar,fgkd87o,t1_fgkbbyo,1580862849.0,"Yeah, I think its more accurate to say most monstrous infantry are glass canons. For some army lists that can be cost effective. 
  
Like you said, the better units can shred enemies when they are in a proper blob. But, handle with care. 
  
For lizardmen i think Saurus serve as better infantry, and their dinos as better monsters. You dont need more mass on your front line, and there are better damage dealers/flankers in the roster. They arent bad, like Trolls, just kinda meh. I havent tried a Nakai campaign tho"
