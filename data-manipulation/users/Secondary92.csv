People have always started bushfires here. It's just far easier to catch them now. A small percentage of fires were caused by arsonists anyway. The largest were caused by lightning. As far as mismanagement goes, there's some truth there but also heaps of intentionally false info out there. RFS hit fuel reduction targets. Are they underfunded and understaffed for current conditions, absolutely. But hazard reduction burns isn't a magic bullet anyway, and the safe window to perform them is narrowing every year. The real reason the fires were as bad as they were was on the back of the hottest and driest year in the country's history."
chicagobulls,feiyots,t1_feium1t,1579150945.0,"Yeah i agree that it's not the ideal defensive system for Kornet, hence why he's looked worse here than NY.

chicagobulls,feiuevu,t1_feisnyv,1579147491.0,He's probably a better defender at center than Lauri is. Lauri's rim protection is awful and Korn can actually block a few shots.
