>Prof. Hutchinson : I don't think it ""destroys"" anything. I think it tries integrating itself into our system and our system can't hold it. It's like trying to cram another book into a full bookshelf. If you get a hammer, you can get it in there, but the whole shelf bursts eventually. If it gets out into the internet, we will potentially experience a full IT infrastructure collapse within hours.

From my understanding we didn't ""miss a number"", SCP-033 is changing mathematics/the laws of our universe to accommodate itself, which introduces paradoxes from our perspective."

Actually you can.

Correcting misinformed opinions is a losing battle. It's often not worth the effort. Sometimes it is, when you know the person you're dealing with has the ability to consider opposing arguments rationally. On the internet you can rarely tell, so probably you'll waste your time.

But while we're on the subject, the best rivalries are the ones that are born from great matches, e.g Shock Vs Titans.

If you're a fan of a particular team you still get to watch their matches and root for them. If they're a middling team you can still cheer for an upset or a deep bracket run.

To me that's way more exciting than an upset against a team that wasn't even trying/doesn't care (any upset against NY or Vancouver last year). In tournaments *every match actually matters*."
