Start with simple backflips or front flips, because as long as you take off straight, you will land straight.

Once you've perfected those, you can move on to the advanced level- change direction of rotation each time you hear the trick 'chime'. You can actually do backflip-frontflip-backflip-frontflip perfect landing for more than 2500 points. I've scored a run over 10k points, and more is possible."

1) Good friends are hard to come by. If you can work through your emotional discomfort, you may well have an important friend for life.

2) You're young. Learning how to behave maturely when there is an emotional imbalance in a relationship is important. Someday, you may be in her shoes. It's useful to have some experience with the situation, even if it is emotionally painful for you. Retreating will deny you that lesson.

3) The time apart, and your confession, may have given her the time and space to reflect on what your relationship really means. Given a little more time together, she might actually be coming around to your way of thinking. Now, this part is super important: This should absolutely not be your primary motivation for befriending her again. #1 and #2 are.
