dogswithjobs,fecindx,t1_fecgw0r,1578974841.0,"Yes. Make sure your dad still continues to take his PD meds. My dad felt better then ever after the surgery and didn’t take his meds. He literally had to be hospitalized bc there was no dopamine in his system. He had whole body tremors to the point where he was kneeing himself in the face and couldn’t hold still for 2 days! He had to have a nurse with him 24 hours a day. It was so painful to see him like that. He had no idea he had to continue to take his medicine regularly even if he felt fine. So make sure you and your father consult his team of doctors before he changes how he takes his meds. 

My dad was nervous about the surgery for obvious reasons. He had to get it twice. He wasnt nervous the second time bc the cocktail of drugs they give you for the second half of the surgery wipes your memory. When my dad was in post op he was telling us and his nurses that he never got the surgery because he was shaking to much. We were all so confused and told his nurse. (His head was bandaged up with a tiny bit of blood on it) so his nurse actually called his neurologist to make sure he actually got the surgery. His neurologist said this is actually common. Needless to say he was much more relaxed before his second surgery bc he didn’t remember a thing from the first. 

God bless your father and your family. Parkinson’s is one hell of a disease. Your dad is amazing for continuing to battle against it. And is so strong for enduring brain surgery."
dogswithjobs,fec9jyi,t1_fec8plz,1578969075.0,My father was diagnosed at a very young age (29) before I was even born. He is now 59. The surgery helped him but there were some complications so he actually had to get it twice. There was an infection the first time. Ever since the surgery he has difficulty walking and talking. It has definitely helped his tremors though. You are a blessing to your mother. I know the toll this disease takes on families so my heart is with you.

Rabbits,fdeigzb,t1_fdddazs,1578339727.0,Do it!!
Rabbits,fdeifhy,t1_fdegjzd,1578339702.0,Where we live dogs are only allowed at specified “dog beaches”. So we steer clear of dog beaches and only take him to beaches where dogs are not permitted. Sometimes there are dogs even though they are not allowed but they are usually on leashes and the owners are pretty good about keeping their distance. If we see a dog off leash we pick him up and look at the owner who normally will leave or put their dog back on leash. And just to be safe my fiancé and I agreed to never take him out unless there’re two people.

kauai,fcwe7gy,t1_fcwdf2o,1578023378.0,Thank you :) He applied to the county a few months ago. They said there is a critical need for civil engineers on the island but I guess its just a long process to get a job with the government.
kauai,fcwdzr9,t1_fcwdanq,1578023230.0,Thank you! He applied to the county about 4 months ago. He called and followed up and they said they have not even started to look through them yet unfortunately.
