CasualConversation,ff8ijn0,t1_ff8faip,1579680088.0,"I personally would go with a “did you have smartphones growing up?” as a divide. Gen Z is like the first generation of digital natives, where technology was already there to be used. That said, it’s hard to define generations. I’m a millennial born in 87. However, my experience of growing up is nowhere similar to people born in 81 or 95, because the world was already changing super fast."

running,ff2zkyx,t3_erck3l,1579529614.0,"Fellow IBS sufferer here! There’s hope. I run ultra marathons (50-110k) so I’m no stranger to long runs.

My strategy is to always have something solid to eat for fueling. Gels make me cramp and ultimately cause diarrhea so I never use them. Instead I do power bars, trail mix, or bananas. The key is to never really go below certain hunger threshold. You should eat on schedule. 

Also, I always carry Imodium with me. I rarely take it, but the thought that I can always do is really helping.

You will have to adjust and test what’s the best option, but keep in mind that it can be managed and it ultimately won’t harm your running when you find your balance. Good luck!"

As for the exercises after the run, I found yoga really beneficial. Nothing crazy though, just a couple of poses I found through YouTube while searching “yoga for runners.” 5 minutes for that after I come from a run and my muscles feel fresh."

At that time I would definitely consider myself a neuroscientist, as I also published in neuroscience journals. However, I definitely had a much narrower understanding of the field than a formal neuroscience grad, but since neuroscience itself is really broad, you can still focus on one aspect.

Also, the question is a little bit abstract. It’s like asking if a mathematician knowing how to program can be considered a computer scientist. It all depends what he/she wants to do with their knowledge."

I have a couple of friends who are soccer fans, and bought consoles only to play fifa. They are not interested in playing anything else on them. 

And another thing is that there is not much you can change every year. It’s freakin’ soccer, so what would you expect? Also, they update the mechanics every year, so saying that it’s the exactly same game is ridiculous. Playing FIFA 14, and FIFA 19 is a completely different experience."

Sure, the fact that they threatened a little kid with hell for years and punished him for not going to church, and reprimanded him at church when he was not singing loud enough will totally have no effect on his mental well being."
wholesomememes,fe0vy19,t1_fe0pcjy,1578819291.0,"Same here. I was heavily bullied in middle school and one day  I just broke down saying that I’m not going there anymore. I confined in my mom who is doing what to me, and she blabbered everything to her friend who was a town gossip. Instead of any consolation, the next day the bullies knew everything and made my life even harder. 
That was the last time I ever told my parents anything in secret. They weren’t bad parents, but they were much into victim blaming and didn’t take anything seriously. I was on the verge of being suicidal back then, and now I’m 32 and totally fine, but I doubt they realize how close they came to losing their kid all those years back."

Sure, staying at home watching a movie after work and redditing till late night hours might seem like a good idea, but it’s far better to just go for a walk, or try to cook a nice meal you’ve never tried before. People love watching other people’s lives on social media, yet they rarely really try to live their own to the full potential."

worldnews,fdxqcq6,t1_fdxg0dl,1578771772.0,"Not directly. Sociologists say that there is this notion of a ""homo sovieticus"", a person shaped by living in the communist country. Even though Poland is not a communist country since 1989, a lot of people there still remember communism as better times, because ""everyone had jobs, and the government made sure that everyone had the same things in possession."" In reality, most jobs were redundant and the economy was not sustainable.

So now as the government started giving away ""free money"" to people, they like it as it reminds them of simpler times when you didn't have to work hard for anything. It's sad, but 40 years of communism can really fuck a country up for generations to come."

In Switzerland, the first 3 weeks of illness in the year are fully paid by the employer, and most employers are also insured so that they can pay you 80% of your salary if you need to take more days off because of a prolonged illness, and it is all regulated by the cantonal (state) laws.

It was a good game to begin with, just not for everybody. Sure, now it’s even way better with all the features, but it wasn’t buggy or anything like Fallout 76. 

People overhyped it themselves and then went crazy when it wasn’t what they thought would be. I’d compare it to Death Stranding. Some people were disappointed because it wasn’t what they expected, but for some people (me included) it is really a great game. To each their own.

So comparing No Man’s Sky to Fallout 76 does not make any sense, as the former wasn’t what most people expected, while the latter was for the most part unplayable."
