This is almost certainly true in most races but they did not give enough wiggle room for people not paceing themselves. I mean would it kill them to wait 20 or 25 minutes?

Other than the long term effects decades later the job was amazing, relaxed atmosphere, high pay, easy work, no safety hazards (except the obvious but no one knew then).

They do not aim to help people out of homelessness permanently. They do not aim for sustainable solutions they have low quality services and take tons of money that could go to better organizations. They are not monsters but they are definitely below best practice standards. I've worked 8 years in homeless prevention and recovery. Professionals and experts are part of a larger community trying to address the issues together. Salvation Army refuses to participate in the discussion and separates themselves. It's weird.

A nonprofit is not a business. You start a non-profit if you care passionately about an issue and while working towards goals with the dozens of other industry professionals you and them decide you need to formally organize to address the issue. I cannot stress enough how awful of an idea it is to set out to start a non-profit.
nonprofit,fedy9gq,t1_fedod5p,1579022429.0,Wrong wrong wrong. If you are in the US please review IRS policy before spouting guesses as fact. The organization cannot value the donation ever.
