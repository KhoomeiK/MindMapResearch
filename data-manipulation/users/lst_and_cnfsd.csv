fatlogic,ffusz8q,t1_ffur8oc,1580248767.0,"Yes, I agree.

Just remember the stomach misery next time you're chosing what to eat. Asking myself ""is this food worth the physical discomfort im definitely going to feel afterwards?"" helped me a lot when fighting my BED. And remember that this one choice doesnt invalidate all the other hard work you did. You can do it!"
fatlogic,ffuqq9o,t1_ffupo0s,1580247519.0,"The issue is that the dismissive phrase ""concern trolling"" is overused now, and applied to people who are just genuinely concerned. Nowadays if anyone pipes up with, ""hey, obesity isnt healthy; here's why..."" They are instantly called a concern troll.

Also, a lot of people have good intentions, but bad manners, just like Christians telling you that you belong in hell for not believing in Jesus. It comes from a concerned place, but is not executed in a productive way. Nobody should berate anyone for what they ate on one occasion because you don't know if that person has eaten healthfully the rest of the day, week, or month, and now they are treating themselves to cake. Strangers should never comment on others' foods or bodies directly. 

But like, if you live with someone who cares about you and you tell them you want to be healthier, and they observe that what you are eating consistently is not conducive to your health goals... Well I think it's perfectly appropriate for them to say something, as long as it's constructive. Like, ""Hey, I recall you said you wanted to eat better. Is that the best choice for you?""

And don't regret the cake you had. It's okay. It's done, it's over with, it's already in your digestive tract. You are not a bad or disgusting or shameful person for eating it. Just move on and get back on track."
fatlogic,ffuowxq,t1_ffumh7n,1580246489.0,"Again, it depends on the context. If you're on the internet preaching about HAES, you can bet somebody is going to bring up obesity consequences because obviously that message must have missed you, and you are now encouraging others to actively harm their health, and its important that somebody speaks up. It doesn't make the people who do so ""feel better about themselves."" In fact, most of the time it makes us sad that so many people are misinformed and/or spreading destructive misinformation. If you're just at work and someone just starts talking about your weight specifically out of the blue, then yeah, shut that fucker down.

Whether it's religion or health facts, you of course have the right to close the door on, ignore, or block that person. If Christianity is true, I'm going to hell. But I still know that most Christians who try to convert me genuinely believe I am going to hell and want to prevent that, despite there being no evidence. There *is* overwhelming scientific evidence that obesity is harmful to human health. It is not a matter of *opinion.*  Maybe if you're seeing constant reminders that obesity is bad, that is a sign to make changes. You'll see that lots of people on this subreddit experienced exactly that, and that's what motivated them to change. 

If you are already in the process of making changes: congratulations! We are all very proud and supportive of you here. You will find that many of us at fatlogic also have recovered or in recovery from a variety of eating disorders. I personally have made a lot of progress with my BED by focusing on the emotions underlying my urges to binge. Its not entirely gone- i doubt it ever will be- but I'm much better than I used to be, and now do not struggle with weight gain. Healing my broken relationship with food didnt happen overnight; it took a lot of work and time. But I had to be motivated to take the first conscious step to fix it, and decide I wanted to *stop* bingeing, instead of just surrendering to the disorder and gain a bunch of weight. 

And obviously the shame surrounding weight and eating disorders doesnt just go away. But you can decide today, right now, that you no longer *want* to feel shame about it, and that you have the power to fix it. Then you work on not being ashamed by consistently maintaining positive self-talk (""I am overweight but that is okay. I am working to take better care of my body because I love my body. I can do this""), seeking support from positive communities and health professionals, forgiving your setbacks, and celebrating your progress."
fatlogic,ffum04z,t1_ffubxa5,1580244790.0,Originally downvoted and then i had to scroll back up to upvote
fatlogic,ffukvwa,t1_ffua3jz,1580244105.0,"You're wrong. Most people do not make comments about people's weight unless they claim that its possible to be healthy whilst very overweight/obese or are in a position to influence others, and the few that do comment on non-weight related posts or IRL are simply assholes that should be ignored. When people do comment on FA's/HAES posts, and it's just a comment talking about the consequences of obesity, it's not rude in the slightest, unless you believe that reality in general is somehow rude. If that person feels ""gross and ashamed"" as a result of hearing the facts, that is not the fault of the person who commented. They likely already felt like that because they knew the facts, and were most likely attempting to suppress that feeling and the genuine need to accept responsibility for their health and make lifestyle changes by participating in fat activism/HAES propaganda. 

If you feel gross and ashamed when you think of how *you've* treated your body, well...stop. That's not really helpful. But also stop overeating, make sure you do some enjoyable exercise every day, and work on your relationship with food and your body. Some people genuinely care about others and dont want to shame them. They just want to encourage them to start behaviors that are healthier than the ones they currently exhibit."

fatlogic,ffezirx,t1_ffeyrkj,1579871386.0,"Its more like 10lbs max. Most bodies ""like"" to be a subset of a weight range *within* their healthy BMI weight range.

fatlogic,ffevpme,t3_et4l56,1579867549.0,"At the heaviest I ever was (150 at 5'5) i actually *liked* the way my body looked. I had hips and a little more boobage, and i finally felt feminine. But i also had constant body aches, exacerbated PCOS symptoms (mood swings, absent periods, acne), worsened depression, and i couldnt run as fast or do as many pull-ups. So i am now much more comfortable at 135-138 lbs."
fatlogic,ffev49w,t1_ffecrsq,1579866855.0,"Interestingly enough, i actually did 2 back-to-back 13 week cycles of bootcamp. The first cycle, i was stressed to no end (no confidence, still learning everything). We had 15 minutes total to get through the serving line and eat what was on our tray, and wasting food was disciplined later. I was disciplined with exercise (we call it Incentive Training) a lot the first cycle because i was bad at everything, and I wasnt good at eating fast. I lost 8lbs, going from 140lbs to 132. 

The second cycle was less stressful, but a lot more depressing. I knew what i was doing, but i was miserable knowing i had to do everything again and couldnt go home yet. (I legit thought this was my version of hell, and didnt believe i would ever actually graduate until the moment my SDI yelled ""Dismissed!"" at our graduation ceremony.) I knew ways to avoid being yelled at, what the instructors could and couldnt do to us, and that i was to be IT'ed less than the baby recruits because I had technically completed was was necessary to become a Marine. Meal times were the only thing I looked forward to each day (they didnt even let me shoot a second time on the rifle range; i had to pull pits for four days straight :( ) and i ate as much as I could of the tastiest food I was allowed to have. (I recall looking directly in the eyes of my kill hat and putting cookies in my mouth from the box chow. LORD she was furious! But she wasn't actually allowed to tell me i couldnt eat everything in the box.) Eventually I gained 6lbs back, returning me to 138lbs. I was shredded now, with a little less muscle mass in the legs than i had started with and less overall fat, but I still regained most of the weight. 

Now, MCT and MOS school were different. I calculated the calories in the 3 MRE's they gave us a day in MCT, and it was approx 3500. Way too many. I ate only 1-2 each day, and ""sold"" my extra ones to get out of fire watch. Towards the end though, i started eating all 3, and gained like 10 lbs. The first two month of MOS school i was in their holding platoon, so I had time to work out, but I was still depressed and only received joy from eating. I probably went down 5lbs at that point, but then as soon as actual cook school started, and all we did all day was sit through classes, cook, and eat. I came home at nearly 150lbs! I was literally overweight and felt like shit. I have since lost the weight, but i never ever want to feel like that again man"

It makes it seem like fat = good

They dont specify that the average American is OVERWEIGHT and has an unhealthy amount of fat

The numbers dont match up and the math isnt correct.

The exercises given make it seem impossible to lose any sort of meaningful weight, plus exercise should not be the primary tool for losing weight.

The food portions listed make it seem like you have to eat a LOT to actually gain a lb of fat, which is misleading. It makes it seem like, oh, i didnt eat 15 snickers bars this week; i wont gain any weight! When in reality, a person could have a cheeseburger's worth of calories too many one day, a snickers bar's worth the next, etc. Etc, and by the end of the week theyve eaten 3500 kcals more than their TDEE and gained a pound.
