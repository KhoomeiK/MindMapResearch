DnD,fgokmop,t3_ezo1a7,1580973631.0,"Remember that the DM has the power to say what rules they follow. That being said, changing the rules on the fly isn't always a good idea. If they have something in mind, WRITE IT DOWN. I have homebrew rules for 1s and 20s to make things interesting, I also make it clear that I don't use some rules, such as cover. In my last campaign, I allowed a spell under level 3 to be cast as a bonus action, and allowed some overpowered stuff that I stuck with, that I changed when I ran my second campaign. As a DM, it's also good to keep track of how powerful everyone is, so that you can give magic items appropriate to those who need balancing/buffing, or need some flavour in their game."

DMAcademy,fgoh754,t3_eznm6n,1580969837.0,"Wow, that's really considerate! Always start with the basics. Explain ability scores, relate them to skills, then explain how rolling with a d20 works. Move onto combat, explain how hitting something works, how AC, attack, and damage is calculated, then lastly, spell slots, if they have them.

Maybe throw them in a mock fight and explain every step along the way after rolling initiative. Don't add anything like poison, prone, or cover until they get the hang of it.

After that, throw them into a couple skill based adventures. Somebody steals their coin purse and they need to dodge people in a crowd with an Acrobatics or shove them with Athletics while chasing after them. Make sure they don't lose the individual with Perception.  If they fail that, always have a backup, like survival to notice where others are staring, or insight to guess where they might go. This was my first experience with D&D. I chased a thief down an alley, used thaumaturgy to open a shutter to slow him down, then undid his belt with mage hand so he couldn't run. Just be sure to allow some shenanigans, so they understand it's a game of freedom."
