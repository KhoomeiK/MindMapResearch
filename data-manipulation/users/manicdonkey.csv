canucks,ffe0hvd,t1_ffdxrxv,1579833532.0,"Underrated comment. I don't think he's overly fast in a straight line. It's all lateral movement, acceleration, maneuverability, and keeping speed in tight turns."
printSF,ffbnmiw,t3_eso5fu,1579774439.0,"I liked it overall, but it was a slog through the middle to me. It doesn't live up to the level of the hype, but that's just one person's opinion. Have not read the sequel yet, but probably will eventually."

PersonalFinanceCanada,feoxzgc,t1_fen86tq,1579307825.0,In BC you can't cut commission in a multiple offer situation without disclosing to all parties. Not sure about other provinces.
PersonalFinanceCanada,feoxo18,t1_feolblw,1579307630.0,"Am realtor in BC. That was a bit of an overreaction to new rules at the time and called double recusal. I don't think it would have to actually go that way. Disclosure to both parties is required though, I believe, and of course if a seller wasn't keen they could likely say no. In practice most people who want to sell aren't going to argue with fair market value coming in on paper if all the rules are followed and everything is disclosed up front."
canucks,feowe1s,t3_eq2suj,1579306841.0,Oof those bottom two.
realtors,feob7di,t3_eq0p6e,1579297682.0,"I'm not a morning person so I don't really call until after 10am (if I'm even up yet). Hasn't seemed to hurt my business, but I could see why morning people would want to start earlier. It would mildly offend me as a non morning person to get a call before 9am if it wasn't my family."
whatsthatbook,feequ9f,t3_eorlje,1579039263.0,I remember this (or similar) coming up here before. Check this thread. It has a few possible answers. https://redd.it/cpggzn

interestingasfuck,fdu3zxp,t1_fdu3a9l,1578727139.0,Agree.
interestingasfuck,fdtw3yy,t1_fdtutkx,1578723166.0,"This isn't true. As you approach a pizza radius of the crust width non-crust pizza approaches zero so you'll see that it is not a non factor. It may not be a large factor, but could easily make up ground on 10 cent differences in value.

Edit: not saying it changes the specific example's results, but it does make a difference."
interestingasfuck,fdtt06g,t1_fdtrsnj,1578721737.0,"Except that in pizza there is also crust ratio which increases as pizza gets smaller. Depends on what you value in a pizza, but if it's area of pizza with cheese and sauce involved you have to take crust into account! I think the easiest way would be to drop the radius by the crust constant for that specific pizzeria which could be say 0.75 inches then redo the math."

Edit: it's also possible I don't understand what's going on"
JRPG,fdix10j,t3_eljtxz,1578452974.0,Played and beat this a couple years ago. It's way better. I loved it. I knew it was game on when I hit the boss at the top of the tower in Zozo.
JRPG,fdiwray,t1_fdipx4b,1578452794.0,I did this for this game a while back. Did it on the computer then emailed to myself and downloaded onto phone.
canucks,fdhp3e3,t1_fdhigdk,1578427334.0,Using boost. Can confirm I like it way more than native app.
canucks,fd0m6nk,t1_fczmpb7,1578120762.0,Having penalties in there is nonsensical. At least if they're going to do that they should use a constant to adjust their value. It's so arbitrary and incorrect to say a penalty taken is as negative as a goal against. Terrible stat curation.
canucks,fcwu1lo,t3_ejc812,1578037608.0,Just did.

PersonalFinanceCanada,fbti121,t3_eea2sy,1577079607.0,The money has to come from somewhere. To take one name off title that means the other person is buying the second half. The wife has to provide the money. If they don't have the money they will need to borrow this money likely by way of a HELOC or a mortgage or expanding the current mortgage. This will have interest and cost money.
