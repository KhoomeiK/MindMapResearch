selfhelp,fez7ywp,t3_eqwsrb,1579454630.0,"Dont judge yourself based on the life you have, the things you've done, the people you got involved with. Basically how your life is

These are all circumstances. You know who you really are deep down and theres this person that you wish to be but there are so many things in the way. Enviromental obstacles. You grew up poor for example. Psychological obstcles, you have certain addictions and disorders. I could go on and on.

But try to separate the life you lived and the person you seem to be with who you really are deep down. The person you wish to be.

Dont look at it as if you failed to become that person. Trust yourself. Trust that you if you really want to be who you want to be, then you've done everything you could. You're not blame for anything and theres never a reason you should hate yourself.

Instead of questioning yourself. I recommend questions the things that are in your current life that made you the way you are.

So if theres anything you dont like about yourself, dont blame yourself, you know and trust that deep down you always try to get rid of the thing you hate about yourself.  That's what counts. It's that you're trying.

That's what defines you. Who youre trying to be, not who you seem to be. 

Its not your fault that it takes time to figuire out how to change those things about yourself even if you could never figure it out. It's okay. You still deserve to love yourself and to be loved."
selfhelp,fejjitu,t3_epi4xg,1579176903.0,"Maybe you have a deep unresolved need for attachment. You were pushed away by everyone all your life and you crave to be held and loved and sex enhances those feelings of love and attachment so whenever you face an opportunity or potential for love and affection, you anticipate the feelings of love and you get horny because that elevates the feelings you're anticipating.

To fix this, get yourself in a serious relationship. Start looking. Dig deep within yourself."
selfimprovement,fe5nfkc,t1_fe308hi,1578871769.0,"Yea people don't go to guru's seeking for the statement of the correct course of action.

They go seeking for ways to figuire how to get themselves to actually take that course of action.

If it was as simple as ""just go excersize"" everybody would be healthy.

But I see your point"
selfimprovement,fe2d825,t1_fe0b38x,1578837105.0,"Try loving her from a distance.

Dont fight the feelings of missing her and the getting over her bullshit.

Accept that you love her and theres nothing wrong with loving her for the rest of your life even if you find someone else and you never see her again.

You'll just be loving her as a person, not as your girlfriend. Your relationship might've not worked but that doesnt mean she isnt the same amazing person that you love.

If you miss her, play some memories. Think about her. The best way is to make art about her like a song or a painting or write a story or a script. 

You might not have her to express your love for her on her, but that doesnt mean you still dont have that love to express. Express it in art or whatever way you like, even when you're walking in the park. Express your love by thinking about her for example. Just remember there are still ways to express your love without her

People will tell you that just will hurt you more, the truth is that's what's gonna ease you away from her. Youre not just acting like you dont love her anymore cold turkey.  You're taking your time to heal. Soon you'll find yourself not thinking about her and focused on something else"

selfimprovement,fe05q08,t1_fe01i55,1578803709.0,"When you stated that everyone should simply just do what they should do regardless of anything, you implied that one should disregard how they feel about doing something they should do and do it anyway meaning even if they didn't feel like doing what they should do, they should still do it anyways and when you do something you dont feel like doing, you use willpower.

And you said stop looking for magical advice meaning advice that makes what you should do seem like something you want to do. That's what people want from self help. To understand how to want to do the things they should do so they dont have to rely on willpower.

You're implying that the only way to do something is to just do it. Everybody knows what they should do, they're just here to figuire out how to get themselves to do it with means that are more reliable than willpower."

selfimprovement,fd2m8j9,t3_ejwdlc,1578149227.0,"Great wrote a long comment but it's gone. I'll summarize.

1. Society thinks self-hate motivates you to be better. It has opposite effects. It damages you.

2. Dont be afraid to be arrogant and confident

3. You're not your failures

4. Youre not your bad actions

5. You're what you do about then. You can learn and use the info to succeed. Or you can continue to make mistakes.

6. Dont let society convince you that failures are testaments that you're a failure at your core instead of external setbacks 

7. Dont let ppl drag you down by making you self doubt"
depression,fd289oh,t1_fd261pp,1578143263.0,"I've been meaning to read man's search for meaning by viktor frankl as hes in a very similar situation to me.

Well obviously he had it more extreme (improsined by nazis) but hes in the same pickle as us.

Alone, locked off from the world, and surrounded by toxic guards making sure your life is hell not allowing you to escape.

What this man did is he became suicidal as his life was pointless. Why stay alive if all you are is a body alone in a cell doing nothing. Same boat. Why am I alive if I'm locked in my house passing the time waiting for death giving up after many years of trying to belong on earth.

He answers those questions and how he developed a mentality that allows you to see light and meaning in life and keeps you excited and positive everyday because it convinces you that you're not just some person locked away.

There can still be a lot to you, you just cant express it into the real world. You can still be something even if you're locked away for no one to see."
depression,fd27crp,t1_fd261pp,1578142833.0,"That I understand. When i found myself stuck without people and dealing toxicity everyday, I thought there was a mindset that stops all that from affecting me.

To this day I dont have anything. I still get severely depressed by my circumstances everyday and it stops me from being happy and myself.

You could tell yourself ""just pretend nothing is wrong and do what you love."" You cant do that. You cant escape the realizations that you have no reason to be happy and it's pointless to pretend.

You understand your situation better than anyone and you know you're not someone anyone wants to be friends with and you'll always deal with toxicity in my case. You know it wont go away."

I know what's it's like to love someone beyond for the good qualities they posses. To just love the way they are whether they're depressed and negative or happy and positive. I wouldn't trade them cause itll never be the same about them. 

It's really beautiful when you find someone you want to be on the same boat as they are regardless of how bqd the boat is. The only thing that matters is that you're with them and not anyone else.

depression,fd02to6,t1_fczjpup,1578112807.0,"If anything they are my biggest source of depression so when its up to me, I never see them.

They've abused me since I was 6 and they want me to be a very specific certain way which is a bad arrogant shallow narsacistic racist selfish person just like them and when they see suspect I'm not like them, they threaten me and always yell how they regret having me and how the time and money spent raising me is wasted effort because I'm not paying off. I'm not who they thought I'd turn out to be. Someone who is just like them who caters to all their needs and make life easy for them. My entire life has been ""how do I keep everyone happy"" and I cant get to ""how can I make myself happy"" because according to them even when I'm working 24/7 doing what they please, I'll never be worthy enough to have been born. So I'm still to busy failing satisfying them I cant get to my own wellbeing. Idk if they condescending on purpose or not. All I know is that they have to keep me on my toes running after their needs and wants because it would be dangerous and disgusting of me to spend one second thinking about myself and not them.

Then I spent 5 years trying to find a real family within strangers that had real love instead of the exact opposite, hate and depression. I found one and I relied on them. I was so glad someone loved me for once.

Until I realised they stopped loving me when they didn't bother to help me when they knew they easily could as they had better things to do."

As a kid I had selective mutism which means I must remain silent in front of other kids. Grew out of it but not the social anxiety umbrella. I'm still incapable of talking to people. 

No one will get the slightest idea of understanding me. I'm just that broken 6 year old man child that you look weirdly at and walk the other way after trying to have a conversation with.

I've spent the past 5 years alone like seriously alone. The only people I talk to are the baristas. No job no family no friends just 0 life. It's extremely painful but when I watch netflix I stop feeling alone cause I pretend I'm part of the conversation and I've been doing this for years.

depression,fc87xtc,t3_egdm43,1577528890.0,"Stop obsessing about what you accomplished or not. Start living in the present and find real happiness not that quick sense of accomplishment.

The fun is in trying. You wanna study something you love. Try it. Work around your circumstances and family. Even if you can only afford to study once a week. It's the fact that you're trying that makes you happy. It's the adventure that makes you happy not success or failure. 

When you're 80 youre gonna be like ""I wish I stopped listening to what people wanted me to achieve and stopped playing the ladder game of life of building achievement over achievement and instead I just did what makes me happy, not worrying about success or failure. Just doing it for the sake of doing it. For the enjoyment."" 

I enjoy studying science and currently I'm learning math. I used to get down and feel inferior when I see how other students are more whizzy than me. One time I engaged in math discussion and they made fun of my stupidity. I felt that ""worthless"" that you mentioned.

But then I realised when I stop worrying about if I'm any good at it or not, I end up in a much happier state. I'm just too focused enjoying trying to learn it. The adventure. Who cares if by comparison I'm bad. What makes me happy is the activity itself. Fuck everyone else.

This perpetuated in life. I'm done feeling bad about myself. Life is so complex that you cant really judge anyone. Too many variables. Now anytime I do something even if I'm bad at it. I dont feel bad about myself. I'm not that person anymore. I'm just here having fun. 

My life is so down right now. No job. No social life. I could go on. But I dont I time to feel bad. I'm too busy doing things I enjoy.

Happiness is not a destination, It's an adventure. Its unconditional enjoyment of something regardless of it ending up a dead end or paradise.

The best part, is by living this way, you end up actually making accomplishments cause you're actually focused on the work itself instead of worrying about it succeeding or not."
selfimprovement,fc84164,t1_fc7uvx4,1577526385.0,"Being a pedo is like having the teacher unfairly make you sit on the bleachers for your entire childhood when you were nothing but a good behaved kid while watching the normal kids (straight, gay, etc) be allowed to play on the field all day feeling joy you cant even imagine while kids alienate you and beat you up for being different on top of it.

While I dont tolerate pedos abusing kids, I understand the strong emotions the drive them to abuse kids. They feel alienated and made out to be an enemy. They lost their compassion and morals after dealing with the resentment and the way society treated them. They're done withholding their strong urges for the sake of good. 

If anything behind understanding of their behavior instead not even tolerating ""hearing them out,"" is how you understand how they can be stopped.

 If you learn about the subject and do some research, not just on pedophilia, I'm talking sexual abuse in general. Rape. Male to female. Male to male. Serial killing. Cannbilamism. etc. Its very interesting and understandable but what's exciting is there is so much potential in using that understanding to stop it from happening again and to possibly heal some criminals.

And if you're uneasy about the idea of healing them cause they dont deserve to be healed, remember that the world would be a peaceful place if everybody was the bigger person and gave people what they need and not what they deserved.

Also, look at it this way. You're not doing it to help abusers who dont deserve it. You're doing it to save lives of future kids who hasn't been abused yet. Locking criminals away is just hiding the problem. Pushing the mess under the bed."
