tifu,ffijqla,t3_etk8ts,1579975517.0,"I was living in a sorority and had two roommates.  One roommate would always talk in her sleep. One night she woke up and yelled  HAPPY BIRTHDAY GLADYS!  Gladys was our house mother.  Another time she woke up and started shaking her covers trying to get bugs off of her.  We put a white board on our door with weekly quotes from Jens dreams. 
My favorite nightime story with her is, we woke up and there was a guy in her bed.  Boys not allowed overnight!  Lol  His name was Clay but we called him sand particles, and teased her about sand particles in her bed.  Good times."
