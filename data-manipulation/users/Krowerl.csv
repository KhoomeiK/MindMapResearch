It is unlikely any of the people reading my comment are so undesirable no one would want to be their friend and are part of those aforementioned “certain people” so my statement is to help remove them from that place of loneliness and involuntary isolation to help them feel more comfortable and happier with their current situation.

Being happier increases their mental mood and makes them more approachable to others and potentially forming friendships with them. No point giving good talking advice to make friends if you aren’t in the mood to talk to people or others don’t wish to talk to you."

For those of you who don't understand /u/lilclairecaseofbeer 's text or how resistance works in bacteria (high school level explanation):

\-> Bacteria infects person, person shows symptoms and takes antibiotics

\-> Little by little, the bacteria gets killed by drug A as the patient takes their medication

\-> By some stroke of luck (if you're rooting for the bacterium) or unluckiness (if you're rooting for humanity) one of the bacteria causing the infection however has a mutation (this happens at random and can't be predicted or stopped - it's literally just evolution) and isn't affected by drug A

\-> All bacteria's friends are being killed = no competition for the resistant bacteria for food

\-> Resistant bacteria thrives even as patient takes drug A (because drug A has no effect and the patient may as well be drinking water or using essential oils)

\-> Resistant bacteria now spreads to other people (though coughing, not washing hands etc. causing this resistant bacteria to spread)

\-> Doctors try a stronger antibiotic/ drug - drug B

\-> Rinse and repeat cycle until you have bacterium resistant to the strongest drugs known to man

This is worrying because it means humanity will go back to an age predating antibiotics - a time when a simple cut could become infected and kill you. It'd mean things like vaccinations could kill you (piercing of your skin is a big danger).

Already the first antibiotic Penicillin (discovered less than a century ago) is proven to become less effective against bacteria. (1 example of a source:  [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/01/antibiotic.penicillin.resistance/](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/01/antibiotic.penicillin.resistance/) )
