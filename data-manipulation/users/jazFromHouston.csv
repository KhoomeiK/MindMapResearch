Hearing and dealing with customers that lose them often, I try to give as much information as possible.

Do you have renters/ home owners insurance that may cover it?

Do you have a carrier plan with your companion iOS device that may cover a replacement of an accessory?

I understand that these are small. Very easily lost. I’m not going to tell you to scour your place again. The reason they have a 3 hour life at once is because of the size of the battery. If Apple were to add a backup battery just for pinging and location services, they’d run down quickly or the AirPods may as well be over ear headphones."

Worst case is you must order a replacement from calling Apple or chatting in.

If you’re still in warranty, you can try your luck at around 87% capacity.

Do you have  access to your super drive? If you have the tools, I’d take out the SuperDrive and use that cable with your SSD or original HDD.

These data cables can be finicky. Sometimes connecting/ disconnect them a weird way or simply heat can get them to act up. If the SuperDrive SATA port correctly boots either drive after a few tests, I would advise for a new SATA cable as well as using a Q-Tip with some isopropyl alcohol to clean the leads on the drives.

leave the residue that was found on the logic board.

First off, you want to rule out software first.

Can you hold shift and boot into safe mode?
Can you Command-R and boot into recovery during power on phase?

I don’t want you throwing money at a Mac if it’s software, but it indeed could be the logic board.

Being it’s a 2012, it’s had a good run. Can’t hurt to tinker with it yourself and rule out software first though.
