saltierthancrait,ffjlcue,t3_etuhe6,1580000891.0,Why adapt KOTOR to a movie?  That seems like a terrible idea. The plot worked great...as a game. Part of what made the plot so great was the interactivity of the game and that Revan was such a blank slate that you could play him/her however you wanted. Neither of those factors work well for a movie.

That way they could've showed off her yellow blade in a believable way, instead of having her ignite it for no reason at all at the end.

However, if you're just bi, I think you're making something out of nothing. You're in a relationship, and (hopefully) the last one you'll ever have. Why does it matter if your wife knows you watched gay porn?  

I'm in a similar situation. I'm bi, and my wife kinda just likes to pretend I'm not. So we don't talk about it. It doesn't bother me because what is there to talk about?  I feel like a lot of bisexuals make this issue a lot bigger than it needs to be, and remember, I'm not saying this in a bigoted way, I am also a bisexual. 

My advice is to just move on and not bring it up. It's not hurting anything by not talking about it and it's not ""hiding"" it either.  It's just an issue of there's nothing to gain by bringing it up."
