personalfinance,fefmqbs,t3_eoo587,1579059679.0,"I would suggest Raleigh, since you have support there. Can easily try out jobs and find something that fits.

Wilmington has colleges full of poly-sci kids working service jobs for 8/hr. No family net. Not really a lot of industry. Little bit of construction going on if you feel up for it.

Houston would be good if you had a work history. No family net. But tons of jobs and avenues, but you have got to hit the ground running and make it work."

Symmetrical speeds, upload and download.

More bandwidth than most need or can handle. Maxes out their equipment and people complain about speeds.

Save money and get 100 or 300."
