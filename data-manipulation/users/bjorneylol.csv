>The Overton window is the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time.

pop·u·la·tion noun STATISTICS - a finite or infinite collection of items under consideration.

The Overton window will be different based on the population you are sampling. Whether that is an American population, a European population, a student population, a global scale, etc. 

My point is that globalization is normalizing each distinct countries Overton window. American belief systems are conforming to be more like the rest of the worlds due to the reach provided by the internet. It's not a libtard conspiracy, it's common sense"
AskReddit,fdqre7t,t1_fdqogqc,1578673253.0,"It's wild that you don't know that the Overton window is a subjective scale relative to individual perception rather than a rule, and that left/right has totally different meanings based on who you ask (the Overton window of an American 20 and 60 year old can be totally different). The typical American Overton window has shifted left not necessarily because of a change in American views, but due to increased globalization.

Policies that by American standards would have been considered ""extremist left"" 30 years ago are not looked at the same way anymore because people have access to the internet nowadays and can see that if a huge portion of the world operates successfully under these principles that maybe they need to shift their Overton window to accommodate them."

BitcoinCA,fdkunav,t1_fdkqrd6,1578511503.0,"Technically every time you make a trade you are realizing gains according to the CRA.

So if you traded your way to 15k you need to pay taxes on 14.5k and report the 14.5k loss in the next year.

If you traded your way to 1k and held from 1k->15k->1k you need to pay taxes on the $500 (assuming not a single trade occurred in between)

Honestly it's a crapshoot and I would talk to someone who is more familiar with how the CRA and audit process works. My own personal opinion is that if you got audited right now they probably wouldn't give a shit. If you write off the capital loss and get audited they are more likely to look into it, in which case they will see you owe back taxes."
BitcoinCA,fdkpqca,t3_elua40,1578508585.0,"In any given year were you up? Technically if you went 700 (2017) -> 1200 (2018) -> 500 (2019) you should have claimed a 500 capital gain previously and a 700 capital loss this year.

If you were flat/down every year I would say report nothing and if you get audited just have the trades on hand.

The bottom line though is claiming this is going to a) be a huge waste of time or cost you a lot in accountant fees for very little upside. And b) make you more likely to get audited in the future.
