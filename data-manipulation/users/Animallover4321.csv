HistoryPorn,fh2g6bj,t1_fh0erry,1581251303.0,My mom was a bored teenager when this storm hit. So she did the most logical thing possible and attempted to drive her civic to the store the next day. She made it halfway up her hill (god only knows how) before attempting to call a tow (you can imagine how that call went).

assholedesign,fgwuhdj,t1_fgv72wg,1581165951.0,"Where I live (Northeast US) nearly every store, cafe even some of the malls in the city require a PIN to enter the bathroom. I understand why they do it but it’s sad that the homeless can’t have  liberal access to bathrooms."
assholedesign,fgp9dcd,t1_fgp820h,1581000009.0,"You would be surprised even in wealthy countries with mandatory education, and not everyone is literate. In the united states, a US Department of Education study found 21% were unable to complete tasks that require comparing and contrasting, and  8.2 million adults are considered functionally illiterate with 2/3rds of them being American born.

todayilearned,fgo4pgp,t1_fgo3amw,1580959722.0,I never said it's not. I would like to believe we have at least moved pass the point we were in in 1948 but we still have way too far to go.
todayilearned,fgnjmxc,t1_fgnf9v3,1580946247.0,What’s horrifying is how recent people held these beliefs. You expect this to be from 1848 not 1948.
bestoflegaladvice,fgc4q1m,t1_fgbuzpc,1580669074.0,I stand corrected. Still a horrific event caused by one mistake.
bestoflegaladvice,fgasg15,t1_fgaezt8,1580654905.0,Someone recently mixed ammonia and bleach recently in a restaurant and not only did it send several people to the hospital a manager actually passed away. It’s not something to screw around with.
massachusetts,fg83ynk,t1_fg7y5kn,1580608898.0,Once you find yourself ordering an ice coffee from Dunkin’ when it’s below 0 you know you’re officially a New Englander.
massachusetts,fg82gi6,t3_exfobr,1580607742.0," Don’t worry about going out and getting everything you can always add if you find you need something later on. Really all you need is a good jacket, gloves(at least a thick waterproof version but you may want to grab a thin pair as well), a hat, warm socks,  and snow boots (LLBean duck boots really are worth it). Definitely layering is the way to go. 

Also if you have a car make sure to pick up a good snow brush even if you have a garage (Costco sells an amazing one every fall). Again if you have a car make sure you get snow tires especially if you’re not used to driving in the snow. If you’re responsible for cleaning the walkway and driveway obviously a snow shovel (or snow blower if you can afford it) and ice melt (it’s worth it to get the expensive stuff) also it sounds weird but a seed spreader you push is  great. It makes salting your driveway much easier."
LifeProTips,fg3sz6n,t1_fg2nlze,1580489014.0,To add to that check the expiration dates on your fire extinguishers. A few years ago I had a fire in my toaster oven and found out the fire extinguisher my landlord was so helpful to leave expired 20 years ago.
oddlysatisfying,fg3ai3o,t1_fg2qjg0,1580476184.0,I think so.
mildlyinteresting,ffzbrip,t1_ffz1sl5,1580371245.0,Thanks!
mildlyinfuriating,ffsb0l3,t1_ffrqqap,1580177448.0,"No just pico de gallo & sour cream.  They are similar to the corn cakes(minus the toppings)
that some Mexican restaurants (at least in S. CA) serve with entrees."
todayilearned,ffp55rg,t1_ffnz76y,1580086456.0,I don’t know how widespread it was but it did happen. I happen to know a woman who was unable to get a mortgage in the 60’s despite a good job because she was a widow.  In her case she had to ask a male friend to co-sign the loan so she could put a roof over her kid’s heads.
mildlyinteresting,ffaqllt,t3_esk8qe,1579742184.0,What was donating like? I want to donate but I keep chickening out. I’m less afraid of needles and more afraid of the effects.

mildlyinteresting,ff3exwr,t1_ff2wi7t,1579539684.0,It takes me at least 15 minutes to shower. Granted I have thick hair so at least 10-12 minutes is just washing & rinsing my hair.

oddlysatisfying,feat4qy,t1_feaeed6,1578951976.0,That’s where it was originally posted.
massachusetts,fe2ped4,t1_fe2gr4i,1578841443.0,I wasn’t saying that although most winters we do have one really nice day in the 60s or even sometimes higher before crashing back down. My point was our weather is weird and completely unpredictable.
massachusetts,fe0djti,t1_fe07jkp,1578810899.0,"A good thing to understand about Boston is our weather is never predictable. It’s not uncommon for us to have temps around 75F(23C) and then have a snowstorm the next day. It's always a good idea to check the weather before traveling here. 

That all being said as of now looks like it will be around 30ish (1C) then with a possibility of some snow (just a heads up while that may seem very cold it's actually fairly average or even on warm side for winter)."
interestingasfuck,fdvxieh,t1_fdsg4dk,1578752851.0,It’s a chart detailing the percentage of someone’s  life US has been at war based on the year they were born. So the US has been at war for 49% of your life.
