It’s not that I’m not a strong individual; it’s the way children react to abuse. It’s recorded in research and there’s a reason why allowing your child to be witness to abuse can mean you get charged with child abuse as well.

Shave for a cure helps people overall with cancer; but not that one person, so the people who say “I’m doing it to support my wife/sister/friend” still kind of weird me out. They’re not supporting their person by shaving their head, they’re just donating to a charity.

I’m not sure if that makes sense? But reading some of the replies above about cancer patients not liking when their families shave their heads - I feel like if you do it when they are currently suffering they’re still going to feel the same way when they see you’re bald; they’re just not going to be able to express their thoughts because people will think they’re ungrateful."

His Mother should also not be going through his bag. If he had chips in there how would his sister know?

For not consulting him before throwing out his BIRTHDAY PRESENT from his girlfriend, and for going through his things without permission.

The sister also brought up OPs weight and told him to shut up. I don’t know how much you have to do with teenagers (and that doesn’t mean reflecting back on you and your siblings because every family is different and a sample size of one isn’t enough to make a generalisation) but I work with them and this is pretty basic behaviour for an interaction like this.

The difficulty is (as you may have guessed) is that we’re often burning at the same time here; so we can’t send away our protection in case more fires start up elsewhere or because we’re already on fire.

Doctors are idiots, and having a qualification doesn’t make you infallible, especially when they get freebies from a lot of drug companies to encourage them to prescribe said drugs.

There is evidence that doctors over prescribe narcotics, and it would be in your best interest to be educated on the drugs you may need before you visit a doctor. It will mean that you may notice some of their mistakes before you get the script and have to go back to the doctor for a new one since the pharmacists can’t prescribe drugs and can’t change a script so it doesn’t kill you they just have to send you back to the doctor. Even if you don’t research it yourself first always ask questions.

This has some information on how you can donate to the both the firefighters and the victims.

Another article with more ideas:


https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/bushfire-donations-heres-how-you-can-help/11696418

From my understanding Givit is a good option because people can actually request what they need, and obviously the Red Cross is a familiar organisation for people overseas.

I can’t stress enough that as it’s still an active issue  and many of these people will be at evacuation centres. It won’t be until the fires are out that they will really start moving back into their homes and needing more personalised aid, if you really want to help don’t forget them when the crisis is over. Donations to the firefighters are also essential - many of these companies don’t have the resources they need to continue this fight and many of the firefighters are volunteers - they’re missing out on their usual wage because they are out fighting these fires and saving lives. I have never seen the firefighters so desperate for donations before.

Disclaimer: I am not a firefighter or a victim of these fires, but have some understanding of the response to disaster thanks to my degree in geography. There is a lot of information around about everything if you look into it, and probably some other ways to donate if you look. It’s just important that you double check the charity you are going to donate to somewhere other than there own website.

I hope this was helpful, and thank you."
AmItheAsshole,fcm5e94,t3_ehrttw,1577764682.0,"INFO: Something in your language suggests to me that you’re an Australian? Are you currently fighting on the east coast, or am I completely off the mark? Because for me, at least, that may change how I feel about this.

As it stands I think that a lot of these people here are being disingenuous, being a firefighter means having to be able to drop your life to save other people from a fire, and you certainly aren’t the first person in your profession that has missed the birth of your first child. Also, from my understanding, you were called out to a new fire when your colleague got the call? So the people arguing that you weren’t actively saving people or homes or bush are incorrect?

This is really hard and, honestly, if your wife didn’t anticipate that you may not be able to be there than I’m concerned about her understanding of what you do for a living. Especially if my assumptions are correct and she’s lucky that you got home at all today, considering the casualties that are occurring at the moment. I think you’re better off asking your colleagues about this because your career is so unique to what most people on reddit do. Someone who works in an office every day, or as a waiter, or as an artist has no concept of how life works when you work in emergency services."

Thanks for volunteering though!


Edit: I think this is the same form and it should be blank, but I don’t know how to make the link pretty!

AmItheAsshole,fcicnjk,t1_fcg6v56,1577660578.0,"This 100%. When I was suicidal my plan was to drive my car off the road - preferably down a cliff and away from others. But I also had obtrusive thoughts about driving through a red light and getting t-boned while I waited for the lights to change. There are dozens of people out there that are very lucky that my empathy outweighed my depression because it meant I refused to hurt others to stop my pain. There are many other people that experience these thoughts and just do it.

Plus driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol being one of the biggest killers on the road.

wholesomememes,fc89i7t,t1_fc88qyr,1577529898.0,"So you agree that you cannot categorically say Australia is not a continent and that the general consensus in geography is not wrong, despite your previous comments? I’m just a little confused by your thought processes here?

Edit: are you still saying it’s wrong? despite stating a particular model where it is accepted?"
wholesomememes,fc87zwx,t1_fc8766u,1577528929.0,"So by your own admission it is not wrong depending on the model you’re using? My point is that the model most often used states Australia as a continent, and in this case Oceania is a region. Countries can exist in a region without being a part of a continent, and a continent can exist as part of a region (Australasia? The Americas?) it all depends on how you’re looking at the world; but in no case can you categorically state Australia is not a continent."

I lived in a small town with very few emergencies for a while and they would MAYBE have come if I called about my pets. I now live in a large city and even with minor human emergencies you have to wait because there aren’t enough people to cover them all.

Looking after someone who is upset about their dog is not a first responder’s job - when they say emotional distress it‘s more someone is threatening to harm themselves or others."

So not only can he cut down a tree with that axe he can also throw it and hit a target. Let me tell you, there is so much power in throwing an axe, so that definitely gives me some feels about this photo."
