Unfortunately I just couldn't deal with the compression artifacts, to me it looks worse than a console because the video looks like a badly compressed gif when there's movement. I've tried lots of settings and fixes but haven't been able to get quality I'm satisfied with. I think a big part of the problem is my living room isn't wired for Ethernet so I have WiFi latency to deal with but I don't think there's an easy workaround for that."
pcgaming,ffb9s1b,t1_ff9ucvl,1579756516.0,"I have a gaming PC that sometimes I'll hook up to my TV when I am having friends over or something and we want to play on the big screen. However, it's a real pain to carry back and forth so I don't really do that a whole lot. On the other hand, spending a grand on a second gaming PC for the living room feels like a waste of money, especially when I don't have a ton of time to play games currently. 

I got a PS4 on black Friday for $200, hooked it up to my TV, and I love it. The PlayStation Network game sales often have pretty good deals and I don't need the extra capabilities of a PC while on my TV. Sure it doesn't look as good as my PC, but that's not why I play games. Don't let the downvotes get you down, /r/pcgaming is just elitist sometimes."

On the downside, it's obviously not as fast as a Mustang GT, some of the interior pieces are as plasticy as ever, and my friend had the option that projected a mustang onto the ground which I thought was rather tacky. On the bright side though it can actually be used as a fairly comfortable commuter car with plenty of oomph for merging and passing and a lot better gas mileage than the 5.0."

I'm not actually sure about the vents. The convertible top actually fits right behind the seats, it doesn't take up the whole back space. On the other hand, fake vents are really popular on cars right now and it's hard to tell in pictures."

pcgaming,fekfq0a,t1_fek9o7o,1579199089.0,"Dismemberment has been a pretty on/off thing in star wars games for a long time. If I'm remembering correctly, The Force Unleashed II had it by default but the first one did not. Before that the last game to have dismemberment on humans that I recall is Jedi Knight II but that was only available as a cheat.

While I think a mod for it would be cool, I also don't think the devs deserve any hate for that decision. It's not like *every* star wars game except this one had dismemberment, it's actually been fairly uncommon. Plus I'm sure there was some concern about putting all of the work into it just for the ESRB to go, ""nah, that gets an M rating"" and having to scrap it regardless."

One of the of the most annoying aspects of AMD cards is that their drivers are not just glitchy, it also seems like every person has a slightly different problem. I've had plenty of headaches with the 5700xt but I'm a bit of a nerd so I kind of enjoy the tweaking. There's plenty of people out there who just want something that works and I don't think that's unreasonable"

There's a setting in that program that can change color ratios, so if everything looks good in your Adrenalin settings I'd imagine it's a problem there. If that doesn't work try changing HDMI cables, I've had bad cables do wacky things as well."
Amd,fdkyql6,t1_fdkdobm,1578513916.0,"I think it's just really game dependant. I had no problem with any games until I played the original Mass effect and the card would not go over 3% usage at a very low clock so I was getting like 15fps. I fixed it by setting a min fps in Radeon chill and a min clockspeed in the game tuning section or whatever it's called. So I think for most people it's not a huge deal and is fixable, but it would still be nice for AMD to acknowledge it."
todayilearned,fdft679,t1_fdekr9y,1578369578.0,"As a Cowboys fan (grr, Philly sucks etc.), the NFC East was impressively bad this year, like even worse than usual. 

You would think that since real birds haven't existed for years and have all been replaced with secret government surveillance drones, the NFL would make sure all of the bird teams did well to raise support for our new avian overlords.

 Unless...maybe they're making bird teams mediocre on purpose so average citizens don't get suspicious of the terrifying amount of power the government gives robo-birds nowadays.

Either way, I'm just glad the Cowboys finally fired Jason Garrett."

wholesomememes,fddsn6z,t1_fddlune,1578322947.0,"You are correct that most explosives are made from nitrogen bonds but usually not from triple bonded nitrogen. Most actually contain one or multiple nitro/nitrate functional groups. These functional groups are the perfect storm of relatively stable in day-to-day life and terrifyingly explosive if you mess with them enough. Some examples include dynamite/*nitro*glycerin (which is actually a *nitrate* but the old name stuck), TNT (tri*nitro*toluene), RDX (1,3,5-Tri*nitro*-1,3,5-triazinane), and PETN (Pentaerythritol tetra*nitrate*).

So what is a nitro/nitrate? It's a nitrogen attached to either [Two oxygens](https://cdn.imgbin.com/16/18/9/imgbin-nitro-compound-functional-group-chemistry-nitrite-nitrate-others-Fg0eufCiuJaMpBqjQsUUE6hXC.jpg) in the case of a nitro or [Three oxygens](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Nitrate_anion.svg/340px-Nitrate_anion.svg.png) in the case of a nitrate. These groups then attach to a larger molecule such as [Nitroglycerin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Nitroglycerin.svg/440px-Nitroglycerin.svg.png) (can you see the nitrile groups within that molecule?)

Luckily for us, it's actually really hard to set off these explosives on accident because...well...atoms are inherently lazy and while they love lower energy states, it sometimes takes a lot of effort to get them to start moving towards that lower energy. Nitrogen is still reasonably happy being in that nitro group alongside oxygen so even if it might be happier with another nitrogen, it's a tough proposition to convince it to move over to N2. Being with oxygen is not *ideal* but it's good enough and his parents are starting to ask about grandchildren so unless you light a fire under his ass he's gonna stick with them. Sure another nitrogen is his soulmate but those oxygens still take good care of him.

So why are these explosives dangerous? Nitro groups have a pretty big bond dissociation energy (in this case essentially how big of a boom it makes when you force them apart) and oxygen is there to help make that big boom happen. To continue the dating analogy, nitrogen and oxygen usually get along great in this bond but as soon as a hot button issue comes up, the gloves are off. Nitrogen is generally happiest when hanging out with a single other nitrogen because, once again, atoms are lazy and that's about as nonreactive as nitrogen can get. So once that fight with oxygen happens, nitrogen says ""okay see ya"" and goes for the more stable bond that a second nitrogen provides."

wholesomememes,fddi82y,t1_fddeqav,1578313342.0,"Not OP but I imagine they were making a joke. ""Ether"" is another word for an oxygen with two single bonds that exists within a larger molecule. They probably spilled an ether on themselves but made it sound like they got sent to the ether (another domain). Hah! Wordplay!"
wholesomememes,fddhtdu,t1_fdd9po6,1578312870.0,"Chem nerd here -

Covalent bonds aren't necessarily the weakest or the strongest ""type"" of bond (I put type in quotes because in reality all ionic bonds have some covalent character, and there's a lot of different ways bonds are discussed that I will skip for brevity because I know not everyone wants to read a dissertation-length Reddit message).

When we talk about how strong bonds are, we usually do so by seeing how much energy it takes to rip them apart because us chemists are a violent bunch (at least to tiny molecules, talk about taking it out on the little guy.)
As a couple of examples, the lattice enthalpy for table salt (NaCl, fully ionic) is 787kJ/mol. Meanwhile carbon monoxide, which has a covalent triple bond, has a bond enthalpy of 1077 kJ/mol. Covalent bonds also will stick together even if you drop them in water, whereas ionic bonds often dissociate. Sure, they'll get back together once the water is gone but how strong are they *really* if getting a little damp can pull them apart?

Bear in mind it's not really an argument of which is better, Lord knows I'm very thankful for all kinds of bonds given that life as we know it would cease to exist if our weird little wave/particle friends acted any differently. I just take issue with high school chem teachers making students memorize which type of bond is strongest when really there's a much more nuanced (and in my opinion, more interesting) world out there."
