I don’t want to kill myself. I feel obliged to. I want a friend that may make me feel like I’m human"
SuicideWatch,fg9dp7q,t1_fg9dd38,1580637429.0,It was my life. Everything financial was built around her. I have no friends. I’m healing from stitches across my hands from self harm. Thanks anyways
SuicideWatch,fg949et,t1_fg946gk,1580634072.0,I play video games. That’s it. I spent 90-% of my day enriching our relationsip
SuicideWatch,fg8zl9q,t3_exlhut,1580632219.0,Someone message me and help please
SuicideWatch,fg8ze23,t3_exlhut,1580632118.0,I’m going to die.

DayZPS,ffx4nv5,t3_evolde,1580317670.0,Wish there was nothing added and just things fixed tbh
DayzXbox,ffx2gsi,t1_ffw7srn,1580316328.0,You will always survive a shot of 7.62x39 unless it hits something vital. It is the same damage as AK’s and the SKS. It’s not a one shot. From my experience it kills in generally 3-4 shots. Not taking into account different levels of body protection and vitals.
DayzXbox,ffvsopd,t1_ffv16w0,1580272136.0,No it doesn’t knock you out. It’s 7.62x39

politics,ffif7sv,t1_ffieopn,1579972435.0,"Well of course. Far right is going to be more progressive as they don’t care what you do. By that same sense farthest right, anarchy, is progressive similarly.

But libertarian is mostly economic of which Rogan doesn’t agree with."
politics,ffhr55d,t1_ffharqy,1579949526.0,From what he says most of his views are quite the opposite. He is left leaning maybe close to centralist.
politics,ffhr3uk,t1_ffh5nym,1579949470.0,"Not anymore than the average guy is. He talks about basic conspiracies and is a believer in medical benefits and an aspect of potential spiritual experiences from drugs, if that’s what you’re referring to by pseudoscience.

I mean the dude is pretty up to date on most things. He has a pretty good idea about what is going on as he is informed by scholars for ours on end on a daily basis."
teenagers,ffhhvng,t1_ffgd1ix,1579935953.0,"Not true. Depends on where the money came from. If it was gifted from relatives it is an entirely different situation. Regardless if it wasn’t there is still civil court which might acknowledge that case.

Doesn’t matter as OP has a profile pic of what looks like a child and not someone about to be 18."
skyblivion,ffgg9ev,t3_et9idv,1579905551.0,Looks cool but also looks less interesting. The helmet is interesting though.
mildlyinteresting,fffe9vz,t3_et8t3o,1579882061.0,Is this not a thing in most libraries? My local library in a small rural town has one and my university does as well.
funny,fffdnno,t1_ffeu98t,1579881663.0,Similar to how ponds and lakes freeze. The top layer freezes and sort of insulates it. If lakes froze from the bottom to top then the fish would die as the whole lake would freeze.
ihavesex,ffa5m04,t3_es6gh7,1579728340.0,Idk if this is ihavesex worthy. Definitely cringy though.

StarWarsBattlefront,fex6kry,t1_fewl74q,1579425390.0,Yeah palps is good but far from unbeatable. Any good blaster player can destroy him with Lando or Finn. He just tickles me as Lando
StarWarsBattlefront,fewjgdn,t3_eqhcwl,1579411851.0,"I love palpatine as a character and play him and I feel so bad. Same with Lando I’m just as cheesy with him. 

Both characters are so easy to hit top eliminations and score every game. People always get extremely salty like I’m trying to ruin the game and I’m just like “man stop emoting me I just enjoy these characters lore more than other characters”"
DayzXbox,fepqjd9,t3_eq8wti,1579327929.0,DayZ as broken as usual
DayzXbox,fei855t,t1_fei6wi5,1579132415.0,"Bohemia Interactive and the DayZ dev team underbudget lol? That’s an insane statement back when stand-alone released on PC it was one of the highest selling games on steam. The worst part is they have made little to no progress since then. If anything they’ve regressed since their engine swap

10 years one DLC? Do you realize how many versions of this game they’ve released? How much the price has went up since the original 20 $? Yet they released it to console before the game was even ready to be released. It’s been broken since release and should have never released.

Every server hosted by them has these issues whether you admit it or not. They’re all hosted by them on the same machines.

Hackers and cars don’t come hand and hand. Again, if you have a game breaking element then it either needs to be removed from the game or addressed. If you’re worried about hackers Bohemia needs a better anti cheat than the bullshit they’ve had since arma that stupid battleeye shit. Then they can add cars back in once they’ve solved their hacker problem. Otherwise, keep cars out.

The sub you’re commenting on was literally locked for them not addressing the state of the game. Their on game breaking bugs every other week. From item glitches, ghost bullets, car desync, character deletion, incorrect display of quality, etc. It does not matter how few town models they added in. In fact the fact their wasting time creating more gun assets and town assets instead of fixing the host of current issues is pathetic.

You can’t avoid all glitches. You can’t avoid all inventory glitches. Such as items not removing from dead players inventories due to incorrect values of their status."
DayzXbox,fehci7e,t1_fegwjph,1579113736.0,Nothing says immersive survival game like when a car flys by me. Totally doesn’t ruin the experience that their are wasted assets and time on cars that I literally die when I get in
DayzXbox,fehcdth,t1_fegqq7x,1579113664.0,Taking them out of the game is any easy fix. Any reasonable developers would seek to fix issues and maintain balance in their game. This has been an issue for far too long and needs to be removed until it’s addressed. The team has plenty of time to cash grab more DLC in the meantime
StarWarsLeaks,fegu0km,t1_fegtlj7,1579102509.0,"I enjoyed the movie I watched, but had that happened it would have made the entire movie better for me and a lot of others who were disappointed"
StarWarsLeaks,fegsf0c,t1_fegs891,1579101455.0,"I’m not gatekeeping lol? You’re exaggerating what I was saying. A lot of people on here are not fans no. You don’t get to decide who is more than I do. I never said that it had anything to do with liking the movies. It’s just simply that a lot of people on this subreddit aren’t fans. That’s just my opinion you don’t have to like it bud

The original trilogy wasn’t made by Lucas alone. The prequels made by Lucas were hated by a near majority. I think the last thing needed is to praise Lucas who literally said the movies were made for children"
StarWarsBattlefront,fegs4zk,t3_eosods,1579101266.0,Dude palpatine is one of the most OP characters in the game right now. This has to be a troll
StarWarsLeaks,fegrq4k,t1_fegr40t,1579100990.0,"Yeah it’s just this sub man. The reviews of the movie are good and way better than movies of the past. Join r/starwarscantina if you want true Star Wars fans. It’s a good community built around appreciating the movies.

Everyone here hated the movie before it even came out. They sat for the leaks to bash leaks and not the actual movie itself"
StarWarsLeaks,fegr8gj,t1_fegpg9i,1579100654.0,"I hate that Kylo dies but I find it hard to understand what else to do with him. If you let him live you now have this character who has caused death across the entire galaxy on a massive scale. Would anyone want to live with that? I felt as if he sacrifices himself for Rey as a way of paying back his wrongs to the Galaxy.

At the same time though it would be very interesting to see a Jedi redeemed and have to make up for his wrong and accept his past and put it behind him. Maybe even “let the past die” lol"
StarWarsLeaks,fegqttc,t1_fegodzo,1579100374.0,"I think that it’s a fitting end in one way but also distasteful in another. I get why it makes sense from a balance standpoint but there has been balance with Jedi and sith in the absence of grey Jedi. Would’ve been interesting if maybe her and Kylo became one somehow and that created a grey Jedi balance. 

The problem is that the themes have always centered around good and evil. Would feel really weird I think for suddenly to create this disconnect from that theme right at the end of a saga and might leave a lot of people wanting more of it."
relationships,fe6q59h,t1_fe5t2hw,1578900207.0,She admits this is the first time. Your reaction is to get out? He has never hurt her or kids and this is considered reasonable to you somehow? That man has a life and has value. He needs help not abandonment. He made a mistake and a small one. Punching a hole is bad but not drastically bad. Plenty of people have done this and that be their only violent action.
skyrim,fe0btxu,t1_fe0bqsq,1578809064.0,Of course. The others seem to think those that choose to play on PlayStation feel bad for it. They enjoy the PS4 with the mods they have
skyrim,fe0bo0y,t3_enfnfb,1578808900.0,Some people are really complaining it’s ps4. As if she is going to be devastated about external assists lol? PS4 still has a host of quality of life mods that make the game 10000x better.
DayzXbox,fdsdbqo,t1_fdsda9j,1578700042.0,I love it too. Hence why I don’t justify bad developmental issues.
DayzXbox,fdsd5db,t1_fds7xix,1578699920.0,"Lol added depth. They have a system for knowing if a bullet is a dud. Ruined = RUINED. If the bullet was a dud it shouldn’t say pristine. Also, it’s not very realistic to pick up a bullet and not be able to tell if it’s a dud or not. You’d be able to tell if a bullet was damaged. Firing pin had already struck it or holes or dents etc"
DayzXbox,fdr52a0,t1_fdqvpdw,1578679653.0,People shouldn’t downvote this. There was a reason these subs were locked. The devs push DLC and don’t fix game breaking things like cars and ghost rounds.
DrMartens,fdorpvq,t1_fdor5yx,1578611401.0,Martens soles will get hard and crack at low temperatures. Martens are not made for low temperature. The rubber soles are not high quality as the boots are not made for cold weather. They are a thin leather with no insulation.
DrMartens,fdoqw9u,t1_fdnyhqk,1578610876.0,"No, rubber at that temperature gets hard and will crack. You’re lucky if they don’t really"

ancestors,fdmja9m,t1_fdmj36j,1578551948.0,"I have uploaded and edited videos. It’s not my hobby. I do leathercrafting. It takes like 8 hours to hand stitch a belt. I know about time consuming. I don’t know why you think anyone gives a shit or that it matters.

You post the same videos twice in a video promotion and a game subreddit. You also post nearly every upload that you have on YouTube onto reddit. That is spamming. Spam =irrelevant messages sent on the internet to large number of recipients"
ancestors,fdmiz0a,t1_fdmitja,1578551615.0,"Exactly what? I didn’t say anything that you could respond to with that. What does you having a job have to do with anything? Every functioning adult has a full time job.

If you don’t care about views then stop peddling on channel promotion posts. That completely contradicts your statement that you don’t care. You literally post on channel promotion subreddits and then spam on every forum related to a game."
ancestors,fdmil91,t1_fdmiirh,1578551209.0,I don’t upload. I have other hobbies than uploading videos personally.
ancestors,fdmi9p6,t1_fdmi3xl,1578550873.0,"There is a reason you aren’t getting upvoted kid. This is how you lose people’s interest.

I watched plenty of small channels play this game when it came out. This was an easy grab as big youtubers weren’t playing. Had you spent the time to actually make an interesting video and add value to it you’d actually get views and upvotes. Instead you just promote your videos on a forum used to discuss the game."
DrMartens,fdmf4h4,t1_fdm5hwx,1578547831.0,"The leather of Docs is just not at all there for winter weather. They aren’t warm, rubber soles slip on ice extremely easy, doc martens have thin treads that wear down quick, the leather is finished without a waterproofing (meaning it has already been sealed and would be very difficult to even apply a waterproofing to them now), the leather will crack from the salt in snow."
ancestors,fdf4pzd,t1_fdf4bgm,1578353260.0,"This isn’t cutting corners. It’s by design. It’s intended to be this way to simulate how lucky evolution of humanity is. The whole goal is to figure things out faster than we actually did. It wouldn’t be hard to figure it out if they figured it out for you.

I don’t know why you’re so obsessed with Red dead. It has nothing to do with this game. This game has been out since August. It has been doing fine."
