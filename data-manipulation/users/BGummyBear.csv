Not necessarily. Turtling and not trying to stand up is a good way to mitigate Khabib's damage output on the ground, but it still doesn't do much to progress your own position. Conor's strategy in the first fight was to weather the storm whenever he got taken down and then look for a finish on the feet in later rounds, but Khabib outstruck Conor on the feet too.

pcmasterrace,fdexemp,t1_fdeuum4,1578348622.0,"There's a few reasons. First of all it's always a good idea to have more watts than you'll ever use, since running a PSU at 100% burns it out much faster. Using a larger PSU means you can push your PC just as hard without pushing your PSU as hard as it can go, which extends its lifespan and reduces the risk of it blowing up and damaging the rest of your PC. This also allows for more overclocking.

Secondly, changing a PC's PSU is a major pain in the ass, so many people like to get the wattage you'll need in a few years down the line rather than what you need right away. Most PC builders will upgrade their PC at some point in its life span.

Lastly, force of habit. PC parts have increased in efficiency massively over the past few years, and equivalent parts are now much easier to run and require far less watts. Many people who have been building for a few years simply go with the wattage numbers that have worked for them in the past, and they may be pushed up even higher to allow for SLI/Crossfire rigs which were all the rage at the time.

If you're curious why those huge PSUs exist in the first place, it's because they're not designed for gamers. The largest wattage PSUs are designed for servers and workstations that will be handling tasks well beyond the scope of the average commercial consumer."
