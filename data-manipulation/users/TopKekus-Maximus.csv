As for commiting, I'd say to get comfortable with smaller drops first and then go for bigger ones, as there isn't huge difference between them. Just be confident that you will do it and try to keep bkth feet above the board, then the landing comes naturally"

NewSkaters,ffbnj29,t1_ffahmta,1579774295.0,"Ok, I looked it up and after a lot of thinking and many many people with opposing opinions I think you may be right, but I'm still confused because if you were right then a nollie big spin would be the same as a switch fakie frontside big spin, and even though the direction you would be going and the foot position would be the same, one would be a frontside big spin and one a backside big spin, even though they look completely the same. But in this case, shouldn't there 2 more stances, or at least a switch fakie? Because switch fakie is identical to nollie, even though the tricks are clearly different (even if they look the same), but I haven't head anyone mention switch fakie and switch nollie, only regular, switch, nollie and fakie"

NewSkaters,ff94taw,t1_ff922c2,1579704853.0,"You're shoving your foot forward and the board is rotating inward, which makes it a nollie fs shove. Do the same in refular stance and it will be a fs shove"

Let's not forget that every single character in the game is a psycho, soldier is no different (well, except for the fact that he's really dumb, which might explain his dedication). As for the melee, a single name is not enough to count as evidence, remember that being in the army means discipline, which explains the name for the weapon. For all we know, he could've very well been abused in the army, or not abused at all. He's just soldier"
