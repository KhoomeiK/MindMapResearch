DaystromInstitute,fel2ppl,t1_fekzepu,1579212775.0,"Agreed. That episode kinda broke the Nechayev is Evil theme for me.  An Admiral would have a broader view of issues than a Captain ""in the trenches"" might. Also, an Admiral is just as likely to be a political creature, as well as a warrior. In many cases, we see Nechayev in command in situations that are by their nature, highly politically charged. For me, Nechayev never crossed the line from Fleet Admiral to political monster like others had, like say Adm. Dougherty did in the *Briar Patch.*"

I see you've met my management."
DaystromInstitute,feksx1j,t1_fek6n7k,1579206931.0,"Agreed. Compare Jellio's roughshod approach to a new crew and ship he is unfamiliar with, to Capt Pike's approach when he was temporarily placed in command of *USS Discovery*. He admitted that the tight knit crew knew their jobs, and he wasn't going to stand in the way of them operating the ship as efficiently as they knew how. He was also far more willing to listen to the council of his officers, and even willing to admit to a junior officer that he was wrong on something (admitting that missing the war caused him to act with recklessness to prove something).
