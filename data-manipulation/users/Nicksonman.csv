HalfLife,ffbq9if,t1_ffbppqh,1579778304.0,"I'm bummed about that too. I have a feeling the game will better enjoyed with teleportation, just cause the game was designed around it, and cause apparently it's the most advanced teleportation system we've seen. 

Alyx reminds me of the Bullet Train demo which didn't even have full teleportation, it was hotspots. But you know what, I loved it and wish there was more.  As much as I like smooth loco, I can imagine a really well-optimized Valve game like Alyx that uses teleport but is really engaging to the point where you forget about how you're moving around."
