Seriously tho, if you want to fill out your clothes & look juicy at the same time, you can't go wrong with Squats, Deads & Bench. Compound exercises are king.

Add a protein shake or 2 a day for the extra calories (and the extra brotein because, you know, muscles want protein). Sometimes you can't help getting some processed bullshit into your system and sometimes you can't even be sure if something is processed or not anymore."

Now, i'm not responsible if you hurt yourself, but you really need to start putting more effort into it. Increase the weight stack. Start at your usual working weight & increase it incrementally until you can do 10 reps MAXIMUM. If you can do more than that, increase the weight.

A good idea would to be this - Figure out your 1 RM (rep max) for each specific exercise (especially bench, squat or deadlift) then calculate 70% of that weight. Use the 70% of your one rep max as a guideline for where you might need to start. Then you just apply progressive overload from there."

Fitness,ff8evb9,t3_es7ysr,1579675497.0,"It's hard to tell since there's alot of info missing about your lifestyle & how you train, but here's a few pointers.

1. Progressive overload. Bring a notebook or use your phone to progress your lifts. I use an app called FitNotes. Don't rush it, but try to up your weights every week and when you start plateauing, add another set instead of weights. Metastudies have shown that staying between 40-60 reps per muscle group per workout brings maximum muscle stimuli. So basically 1 exercise for 4 to 6 sets, or 2 exercises for 2 to 3 sets. Remember, this is per muscle group.

2. Aim at 1.5 grams of protein per KG of bodyweight. In your case, try aiming at 100 grams of total protein intake a day. Get sufficient carbs before your workout for maximum performance. Eat good fats (avocadoes, nuts etc).

3. Sleep atleast 7 hours. Rest is incredibly important, especially for beginners. When you've reached a certain threshold or plateaued, you might have to up your training frequency (i do each muscle group atleast 2x per week, sometimes even more) because the more used your muscles get to a certain resistance, the less it's gonna get stimulated and it'll grow very slowly or not even at all.

4. Warmup! Get the blood flowing with light weights or powerwalk for 15 mins.

5. Incorporate Bench, Squat & Deadlifts as your main exercises. Nothing builds muscle like the big 3. Look up proper technique for each one and start light.

I hope this helps and don't forget to update us on your progression!"
