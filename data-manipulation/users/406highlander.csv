canon,ff4e64r,t1_ff4a3xy,1579561479.0,"Well, you could try to get around the 4 GB limit.  Try taking the card out and put it into your PC.  See if you can format it using the exFAT file system, rather than using FAT32 or NTFS.  Then pop it back in the camera and try to record video at 720p - see how many minutes you can record for before it stops.

FAT32 has a 4 GB file size limit.  NTFS does not, but it's Windows-specific and the camera will probably tell you it needs to be formatted before you can use it (and the camera will probably format it as FAT32).  exFAT has a much higher maximum file size, but the camera firmware will only record to a maximum of 30 minutes in order to get around an old (now-repealed) EU tax directive that meant any camera that records for more than 30 minutes is a camcorder, and thus subject to higher import taxes."
canon,ff3ybx5,t3_erimaa,1579551520.0,"The camera does not ship with the functionality to start a new video clip as soon as the first one reaches its limit; that has to be added in via something like ML.  Unfortunately, Magic Lantern is not available for your T7, yet.  There's still no released version for the T6 either.

As I understand it, the camera will record until 30 minutes is reached, or the file size gets to 4 GB - whichever comes first.  That 4 GB file size is reached after approximately 12 minutes of recording in full 1080p HD.  You *could* try setting the video quality down to 720p and see if that lets you record for longer than 12 minutes?  If it does, you still won't be able to record for longer than 30 minutes at a time.

The Rebel cameras just aren't intended for this kind of work, unfortunately; Canon reserves this functionality for its more expensive cameras, and the Rebel T-series-without-an-i are the lowest-end in the range.  Even the Rebel T-something-i cameras don't have what you're looking for.  These are designed as stills cameras, with some light video capabilities tacked on.

The good news is you can probably pick up a used Canon Vixia / Legria digital camcorder for not much money.  These will do 1080p, and have a decent optical zoom function built-in, and no 4GB / 30 minute limit.  I don't know how good the image quality is with these, though.

Honorable Mentions are given to people who accidentally kill themselves or remove their ability to procreate *after* having given birth.  HMs are also given to those who injure themselves in remarkably stupid ways - you're not required to die or even lose the ability to procreate in order to win an HM.

You forfeit your award if others are killed or injured through your stupidity (i.e. if you remove yourself from the gene pool accidentally, and also happen to kill your children at the same time), and actual suicides are also not counted as Darwin Awards, as the cause of death needs to be accidental.

To win, you also need to be old enough to know better (i.e. kids are not elligible).

canon,ff1dsfx,t3_eqkywz,1579477889.0,"The camera is a decent ""do-all"" product; useful for any type of photography you can imagine (though it's not weather-sealed, so don't try using it for underwater photography) :)

Lenses, however, tend to be more specialized.  You choose the lens based on what the type of photography you're going to use it for.  The basic kit lens supplied with pretty much all Canon crop-sensor DSLRs is the EF-S 18-55mm zoom.  This is a basic zoom lens useful for a lot of every-day types of shots; 18mm gives a reasonably wide field of view, and 55mm is the sort of focal length you want for portraits.

Landscape photographers tend to choose both a wide angle lens, to capture a lot of the scene all at once, and a lens with a longer focal length, in order to focus on and highlight specific features of a landscape.

Wildlife photographers generally want to shoot their subjects without needing to get too close.  You'll want a lens with a long focal length for that.

Wide-angle:  Look at the Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM.  It's a low-cost wide-angle lens, and able to create sharp images.  Great for the wide-angle aspect of landscape photography, and decent enough for indoor shots (i.e. real-estate photography).

Zoom:  Look at the Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM.  An astoundingly sharp zoom lens that is available very cheaply (especially used/refurbished).  Great for wildlife for beginner photographers, and can also be used for those tighter detail shots for landscape photographers.  I see you are interested in sunrise/sunset shots - this lens would be a good choice for that - a long focal length makes the sun appear bigger in shots.

As /u/kickstand says, the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is very often recommended for portrait photography.  Although this lens's 50mm focal length is covered by the zoom range of the 18-55mm kit lens, this lens has a very wide aperture in comparison to the kit lens.  A wide aperture means that the lens lets in a lot of light.  This means a short shutter time (good, because there'll be less motion blur due to the natural trembling of your hands).  And, it means you can shoot in darker conditions (indoor / low-light shots).  A wide aperture also means the background of your shots is more likely to be blurry, which means your subject is more emphasised.

Use the kit lens for the short term, so you can get an idea of what you can and can't do with it - then look at what type of shot interests you most, and refer back to this topic to see which lenses you've had recommended to you for the type of shot you're trying to get.

I note you're using the European market name for the camera (EOS 600D) rather than the American market name (Rebel T3i) - if you happen to be in the UK, I can suggest a few places to look for second-hand lenses.  If you're elsewhere in Europe, someone else here may be able to help."
canon,fez7okw,t1_fez66a1,1579454539.0,"The 30 minute limit was a means to get around EU import tax laws that classified any camera capable of recording for more than 30 minutes as a camcorder - which were then taxed more highly than those that couldn't record for that long.

As I understand it, that law has changed, but the 30 minute limit stuck around (at least for a while; I don't know if the recording limits are there for newer products like the EOS R or RP).

The T6 has other limitations - no microphone port, for example, that make it less desirable as a video camera.

Long answer: nooooooooooo

Encrypt a document using a respectable cipher and attach it to your email.  Someone has to intercept that email and try to either steal the encryption keys, or brute-force crack it.  Brute-force cracking is time and processor intensive (it can take a single PC many years to work its way through even a 64-bit RC5 cipher; if you have a supercomputer, or a malware-controlled botnet you can use, then you can get through that faster) - modern encryption keys tend to be as much as 4096 bits long (the longer the bit-length of the cipher, the harder it is to crack, as the number of possible combinations increases).  Downside: people don't usually know how to encrypt and decrypt documents.  In the older days, more computer-savvy people used an application called PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to encrypt their mails before sending them.  Some email clients will include encryption based on PGP, which can make encryption and decryption of attachments easier for users.

Send a fax - sure, someone has to intercept the fax mid-transmission - but if you can record the whole call's worth of fax tones, you can use a piece of software to turn them into an image.  [A little more on that here](https://ask.wireshark.org/question/4813/fax-over-g711/).  The security in faxing comes from the fact that it's so damned old that people forget fax is even still a thing (i.e. security through obscurity).  Remember, when the fax comes out at the other end, unless it's a fax-to-email system (receives the fax via modem, decodes it to an image, and sends it to you via email), then the fax will actually print out and sit on the machine until it's retrieved (i.e. anyone with physical access to the machine can pick it up and read it).

Practical alternative - transfer the file via an intermediary service (Microsoft Sharepoint, Box.com, DropBox, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc) that uses HTTPS.  The encryption happens in the background, without the user having to do anything.  Uploading and downloading the file is easy.  Security for the file is as good as the username/password you use to share it.  Once you verify the other party has the file, remove it from the hosting service.  Job done.

I work in network support, and have managed VoIP systems and carried out complete deployments (migrating users from old analog PABX telephone systems to Cisco CallManager VoIP), including integration of fax machines via Cisco analog telephone adapter (ATA) devices.  I fucking *hate* fax machines."

At least CA is easily correctable in post, so the dodgy AF is what lets the lens down.  When it works, the AF is fast, quiet, and accurate.  Then one day, out of the blue, nothing but hunting :(

After I switched to the 6D, I bought the EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM as it's the same field of view at both ends of its zoom range as the 17-85 had (the 17-85 was developed as a crop-sensor version of the 28-135).  Really decent lens; less CA, and no AF issues that I know of.  And my copy cost me just £50 via eBay."
canon,fen982p,t1_fen76z8,1579279724.0,"As someone who owned the 17-85mm - it's fairly prone to chromatic aberration, and the autofocus system on these lenses has a tendency to die, resulting in AF constantly hunting for focus.  The problem is apparently to do with a ribbon cable for the AF system becoming damaged or otherwise unseated within the lens body, requiring the lens to be dismantled for repair.  This was an expensive lens when new, but this fault means there's a lot of them on the used market for dirt cheap.  My copy of the lens was fine - initially.  I liked it so much I bought a copy for my wife; it arrived and focus-hunted constantly.  Returned it to the seller (eBay purchase).  When I upgraded to a 6D, I gave my copy to my wife a month or so later, and it was focus-hunting too, so I sold it on for very little money.  Shame.

The replacement lens is the EF-S 15-85mm and it's optically better, and as I understand it, has a more robust autofocus system.  It has the 35mm equivalent focal range of 24-135mm, which is a very useful range indeed.

The Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM and Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 DC OS HSM are supposed to be optically far better than either the 17-85 or 15-85 lenses, and they have a constant wide max aperture - either would be my recommendation for a kit lens replacement on a crop-sensor body; just be prepared for the wallet-hurt - they're not cheap."

To compress 24 hours of time into 1 minute of video at 30 frames per second, you'd have to set an interval of 48 seconds, and you'd end up with 1800 photos on your card at the end of that 24 hour period.

When I moved to the city in late 2003, I got to/from work by bus.  It *sucked*, and the nature of my job required that I had my own car, so I got through my test and started driving.

No problems at all with any of them.  My used 6D came with a genuine Canon battery and a Duracell battery.  I used Top-Max batteries in my 1300D, my dad's 500D, and my wife's 100D and M50.  I use DSTE batteries in my PowerShot G1X Mk II and my wife's PowerShot G9X.

The third-party batteries last only a little bit less between charges than the Canon batteries, but not enough less to justify the much-higher asking price of the genuine battery pack.  I don't do this for a living, it's a hobby.  The third-party batteries charge fine in the official charger, too.

The EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM is a great choice for a beginner's telephoto lens, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Your choice of lens though is more dependent on what you want to shoot with it.  What are you looking to shoot?

Battery grip - there isn't an official Canon grip for the 200D; it wasn't designed to have one.  Despite this, there are a couple of third-party grips out there, which have an external cable that runs to the cameras' remote shutter trigger port.  They'll work, I guess, but I haven't any experience using them.

ND filters - there's a couple of ways of adding these.  Either you can buy a circular ND filter for each physical size of lens you have (the filter thread diameter differs from lens to lens) - or, you can buy into a system of square filters and a filter holder, with different sized adapter rings.  I use the Cokin P system, and it seems to work very well.  I only need one sized filter, and I just need the inexpensive ring for each diameter of filter thread to use that same filter with all of my lenses.

You should be able to use the Canon Camera Connect app to remotely trigger your camera via WiFi.  I don't have any experience of using this for timelapse photography or videography though - the only time I've used this feature was to remotely trigger my camera next to a bird feeder (they'd all fly away or not come near if I stood that close with camera in hand).

Another one I'd snap up in a heartbeat would be the Jensen Interceptor.  There's one on AutoTrader right now for £59,495.

gaming,fegbc4n,t1_fefljqx,1579086098.0,"3 months ago, I ditched my home fibre broadband (FTTC, in the UK) because the download speed (""Up to 52 Mbit/sec"" on my package) wasn't much better than what I was getting on ADSL (ADSL was giving me around 10 Mbit/sec, fibre was giving me around 16 Mbit/sec) and the upload speed was exactly the same as I was getting on ADSL (around 1 Mbit/sec at most).  It was the upload speed that was killing me; I upload a lot of photos to Flickr, and I like to back up the movies/music/photos on my home NAS to a sister NAS unit I set up in my parent's house.  The problem is that my street cabinet is over a mile from my house, and every time I complained to BT about it, they couldn't give a fuck.

I replaced it with a 4G router and a Vodafone Unlimited pay-monthly SIM.  I pay only slightly more than I was paying for unlimited fibre, and now I get around 60 - 70 Mbit/sec down, and around 30 Mbit/sec up.

I've used over 2TB of bandwidth since switching.  It's great.

I know internet in the US can be garbage, and I know we're paying more for it in the UK than they do in parts of Europe.  But I think ISPs are starting to realise that there's largely no point in a low monthly bandwidth cap (i.e. less than 100 GB) if they're going to be offering gigabit speeds when they roll out 5G.

OldSchoolCool,feg5hrw,t1_fefyr2k,1579077852.0,"I wanted a Ford Capri when I was a kid growing up in the late 80s.  My parents never got their licenses so we never had a car - I was the first in my immediate family to pass the test, and I didn't pass til late 2006 - so it never happened.  There was a small independent garage (mechanic workshop) just round the back of our house, and they'd often have a Capri parked outside - so either it was the mechanic's own car, or it was just plain fucked all the time.

Nowadays, if you've got a Ford Capri that isn't literally a small pile of iron oxide, it could be worth a lot more than you might expect.  Looking on AutoTrader, there's a 1971 ""GT"" example with a 4 cylinder 2.0 litre engine right now for £34,999, and it does appear to be in very good shape.  The cheapest I can see is a 1986 example with a 4 cylinder 2.0 litre in ""Laser"" trim for £6,500, and it looks OK from the photos, but has a modern Momo carbon-wrapped steering wheel that looks very out-of-place in that 80s interior; I'd assume other mods too.

The 17-40mm will really come into its own when you go full-frame; that's a wide angle lens.  I'd at least recommend keeping it until you see how wide it is.  I don't personally do much with wide angles; 24mm is plenty wide for me on full-frame - but you may appreciate the extra wide field of view, particularly if you like landscape photography."
canon,feet6fn,t3_eo6qog,1579040677.0,"Your T3 is a decent enough body for the moment.  I would encourage you to invest in your lenses before upgrading the body.

At present, two of your three lenses are compatible with full-frame cameras, which is advantageous.  I'd suggest looking at 24-70mm lenses.  I use the Tamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC USD, and love it.  24mm at f/2.8 on a crop-sensor body is great for street photography (it's equivalent to 38mm on full-frame; I do street shots at 35mm on my 6D, so it's close), and 70mm on a crop-sensor body means it covers a decent focal range for you to use as a walk-around lens.  When you upgrade to full-frame, you can continue to use that lens as a walk-around lens, with the advantage that it will give you wider angles when zoomed all the way out.  That Tamron lens I bought used, for about £330 GBP, which is around $420 USD.

If you are on a tighter budget, you could also do what I did when I jumped up to full-frame without a walk-about lens - I picked up a used Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM from eBay for £50 (they do usually go for higher than that).  It was a good replacement for my EF-S 17-85mm, which wouldn't work on my 6D.  I got a lot of shots with that lens that I'm very happy with, and I continue to use it on my EOS 35mm film cameras.  The extra few hundred bucks you'd still have in your pocket, you could use those towards a newer body.

A 70D would be a decent upgrade from what you have now.  A 6D is also a very nice camera (speaking from personal experience); I upgraded to one from a 1300D (Rebel T6) and had no problems in terms of user-friendliness - it's a big step up in features, but the controls are well laid out and the menu system is very similar; it just feels like a bigger, heavier, better-built version of what I was used to already.  And straight out of the box, it's much better in low-light than my 1300D was.  You may be able to get a used 6D and a used 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM within your budget.

Mirrorless - I've only used my wife's EOS M50 and it's a great little camera.  The EF-M lens system doesn't have many native lenses available though, and its unclear where Canon are going to go in future - you can't use EF-M lenses on an EOS R or EOS RP, and you can't use RF lenses on any EOS M  body - so at present, if you go to a Canon crop-sensor mirrorless camera, you can't really build up a collection of RF lenses to use if you want to go full-frame; your only option is to adapt EF lenses, and Canon have said they're not going to design any new ones of those.

If you're serious about going full-frame and mirrorless is a thing you want, the EOS RP seems to be a great camera at a great price point.  People get all pissy about the RP for video, but if you don't care about video, what's not to love?

For pedantry's sake, I'd say a jacket is either the outer piece of a formal suit, or a piece of smart/casual dress (i.e. a ""sports jacket"").

Whereas a coat is something you'd put on (possibly over the top of your suit jacket) before you went outside in the cold.  It's definitely a piece of outerwear, designed to keep you warm.

I did a bit of Google searching and found [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QHw4f6tyzc) where some guy (whom I will absolutely agree is infinitely more presentable than I am) explains the differences between a suit jacket, a sports jacket, and a blazer.

It was a work trip; I was a network tech at the time.  I live in Scotland, which is more like 0-10°C at that time of year.

With all my thermal gear on, it felt about as cold as it did back home - it was still cold, just the thermal stuff made it a lot more bearable.  I had to take my thick gloves off to take photos of the base we were at - it was like putting my hands in the freezer while clutching ice cubes for 5 minutes.  Not pleasant at all.

The main warehouse area was unheated, and the temperature in the room was below the minimum accepted working temperature for the Cisco network switches that were meant to be installed there; we had to change the plans to install the kit into the adjacent building instead (a heated workshop) to reduce the risk of unplanned hardware failure.

Still really enjoyed the trip though, and it means I've got some really good thermal clothing for the rare occasion I need to go somewhere really cold."

It's also compatible with Sigma's 1.4x and 2x APO teleconverters - I bought a 2x teleconverter, giving me an 800mm f/11 image stabilized lens - though on my 6D, autofocus does not work at that aperture; I have to focus it manually."
canon,fed2kgp,t1_fecvkdn,1578995575.0,"> Why do you need an UV Filter?

I'm not the OP, but I put a UV filter on my lenses as a means to help reduce dust/grit damage - since dust can get in between the front element and the lens barrel; putting a filter on can reduce that, if not eliminate it completely.  I will take them off if I notice reflections/flaring between the front element of the lens and the inside of the filter glass, or when I need an ND/polarizing filter, but other than that, I keep the UV filter on all the time.  I always use [HOYA PRO1D filters](https://hoyafilter.com/product/pro1d_uv/) for this; I notice no extra vignetting or colour cast, and they're not very expensive.

For weather-sealed L lenses, Canon themselves say weather sealing on some of their lenses is only completed by adding a filter.  [This DPReview forum post talks a little more about that.](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4208530)

I also share my lenses between my EOS 6D and my old EOS 35mm film cameras; the UV filter helps to keep the film exposed only to visible light.  I've heard modern film stock (i.e. Kodak Portra) doesn't suffer from UV exposure as badly as older film stocks do, but I figure, why take the chance?

**EDIT:** /u/Teobust - I also support the recommendation for the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM.  That's a damn good lens; my wife loves hers.  Cheap, sharp, and light, and the autofocus system is fast, accurate, and quiet.  I can't believe how good a lens this cheap is.  Ensure you get the STM version, as it's the one with the best autofocus."

2) [This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/canon/comments/c1f3l8/g7x_mark_ii_as_a_webcam_how_to_remove_the_focus/) which suggests that you can't prevent the focus squares from coming up on the screen.

I'm guessing by ""adaptor"", the camera has an HDMI output, and you've got an HDMI input for your PC, and the software you're running just streams whatever content is received through this HDMI input?  If that's the case then yes, the camera doesn't offer a clean HDMI output; it will show literally what is on the screen, including focus points, histogram output, battery level, etc. and this output will turn off when the screen does.  Cycling through the different information displays will increase or reduce what is shown on the screen, but even at its minimum, it will still show you the focus point box.

It's a nice camera, certainly capable of decent stills photography and video recording, but it's just not designed to be used to stream video, even if you've got an adapter that will stream its video output.  The HDMI output is intended to allow you to watch videos that you've recorded and present slideshows of photos that you've taken by plugging your camera into a TV.

Your best bet is probably to use one of the many Logitech webcams that are purpose-designed for this.  Some of them are very well featured, including ones that are motorized, allowing them to rotate and zoom in or out to track a specific subject - obviously those ones will be more expensive though.

I thought maybe MagicLantern might be of some help; there isn't actually an ML port for the PowerShot series, but as it happens, MagicLantern is in some way related to a project called [CHDK](https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK), which aims to expand the feature set of PowerShot cameras.  Might be that one of those custom firmwares might allow the camera to be used the way you want it to - but I would still suggest using your PowerShot as a stills or vlogging camera, and get a webcam for streaming purposes.

Like I said, I'm basically at the end of my very limited knowledge on the subject, and maybe someone else here has done exactly what you want to do with the G7X Mk II - stick around, see if anyone else responds.  Hope this helps.

**EDIT:** There doesn't seem to be a port of CHDK for the G7X Mark II either, unfortunately.  There *is* for the original G7X, but that uses a different DIGIC processor, and won't be compatible with the Mk II."

There are no shots left on the spool, there's no expiry date on the body of the camera, and I've pulled the canister from the camera.

canon,fdncemb,t3_em2y04,1578582777.0,"Blurry shots are generally blurry for two main reasons:

1) you've not got the subject in focus

2) your shutter time is too long

Try setting your mode dial to ""Av"" - this is ""Aperture value"", where the camera is responsible for setting the shutter time, and you're responsible for setting the aperture.  Also set the ISO to ""Auto"".  The camera will then attempt to properly set shutter speed and ISO rating to properly expose.

Use a wide aperture (the lower the f/ number, the wider the aperture) to reduce the amount of time the shutter will be open.  Wider aperture also affords you a narrower focal plane, allowing you to more easily blur out your backgrounds and foregrounds whilst keeping your subject in focus.

Your EF-S 18-55mm kit lens has a maximum aperture of f/3.5 when zoomed out and f/5.6 when zoomed in, and your EF-S 55-250mm zoom has a maximum aperture of f/4 when zoomed out and f/5.6 when zoomed in.

My recommendation would be to replace your kit lens - get either the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM or the Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 EX DC OS HSM.  These are both fantastic lenses, with a nice and wide f/2.8 aperture, and image stabilization.  The autofocus systems are fast, quiet, and accurate.

For insects, you probably want to look at a macro lens.  My wife is the macro user in our house; she has a Sigma 50mm f/2.8 EX DG Macro, and a Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG OS HSM Macro.  The 50mm has basically no minimum focus distance - you can put it right up against your subject.  The 105mm needs you to keep a little distance from your subject, but this is better for insect shots anyway as they tend not to like it when you shove a lens up in their face.  Both lenses are really very sharp, even wide open, and are image stabilized, allowing certain macro shots to be taken hand-held.  We bought the 50mm lens used via eBay for around £150, and I got her the 105mm lens brand new for £360 GBP.

For macro, you also want to add lighting in some circumstances; this will allow you to shoot with a narrow aperture (high f/ number) without too much risk of camera shake causing blurriness.  Narrow aperture will allow you to get more of your subject in focus, as in macro photography, you usually have a very narrow focal plane.  Get a good ring light kit - you can put the light right on the front of the lens - or you could position it off-camera.

The alternative is something like Canon's EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro, which includes a ring LED light surrounding the front element of the lens."

The cheap/terrible one is the Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 Di LD Macro 1:2 (which has their model number A17 on it).  The body of the lens is entirely made of plastic, including the mount, the glass is prone to ghosting and flaring, and it's not image stabilized, so motion blur due to camera shake when zoomed all the way in is likely.  The images are soft when shot wide open, and don't really sharpen up til you stop down to f/8 - f/11, which means long shutter times (blur) or high ISO (noise).  The autofocus is slow, noisy, and not particularly accurate.

On top of that, 70mm will give you quite a narrow field of view, especially on a crop sensor camera like the 650D.

My suggestion:  sell the Tamron and replace it with two lenses - the 18-55mm  kit lens and the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM, which is fantastically sharp and light.  Both lenses are available used for not much money (the EF-S 18-55mm kit lens especially).

Street photography favours a reasonably wide angle; the 20 - 24mm focal length range is generally quite nice on a crop-sensor camera.  Landscape usually warrants something even wider; around 10 - 18mm.  The 18-55mm kit lens covers those focal lengths and is generally a fairly competent lens - not brilliant, but decent enough to begin with.  My go-to choice for street photography on a crop sensor camera is the EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM pancake lens - small, lightweight, sharp, and cheap, and 24mm fixed focal length is great for street work.  f/2.8 aperture is also nice and wide for lower-light shooting.

canon,fddp9fg,t1_fdcb9tf,1578320245.0,"6D classic is a really nice camera (I've owned mine for over a year now) but OP will have to replace both their lenses if they go for a full-frame DSLR.

I was able to upgrade from my 1300D (Rebel T6) because I only had one EF-S lens; all my other glass was Canon EF / Sigma DG / Tamron Di.  I replaced my EF-S 17-85mm lens with a Canon EF 28-135mm from eBay (£50) and took the plunge on the switch to full-frame that way.

If OP goes for an EOS R, Ra, or RP, they will be able to adapt their EF-S lenses, which cushions the financial impact somewhat, but they'll only be using a small portion of the full-frame sensor, and not getting the same resolution in those pictures that they currently get with their T3i - APS-C sensors have higher pixel density than full-frame (EOS R's 30.3 megapixel sensor in crop-mode produces just 11.6 megapixels; T3i is 18 megapixels).  Though low-light performance will be much better on the R because the pixels are larger."

I use this lens with my 6D, and find that autofocus isn't particularly accurate either, particularly when the lens is wide open.  As a result, I only shoot wide open with it when I want to shoot in low light.

The EF-M 22mm f/2 STM is a nice lens and fairly sharp wide open, but again, it's generally best when stopped down a little - f/2.8 - f/4.

As /u/jotoc0 points out, wide apertures mean narrow focal planes, to the point where you have someone's nose in focus, but not their eyes.

Some lenses do work amazingly well wide open - the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM is really sharp without stopping down.  That's not an expensive lens, and works flawlessly on the M50 when adapted."

canon,fd640cg,t1_fd2d6gg,1578185219.0,"As /u/ShadowStrikerPL says, the first EF lenses went on sale back in 1987 with the introduction of the Canon EOS 650 camera body, which took standard 35mm film.

The EF system's main innovation over FD was electronic control over focusing and aperture - the FD mount was purely mechanical, with no signalling or control between the body and the lens.

FD lenses can't be mounted to EF mounts due to the shorter flange focal distance of the FD mount - you can adapt them to EF, but you need an optic to correct for this, and that affects image quality negatively.  Your adapter won't need an optic to connect FD lenses to EF-M or RF mounts.

I have three fairly low-end Canon EOS film bodies, all with the EF mount, which I picked up for just £20 on eBay in 2018 (there was a fourth in the job lot but I gave it away to a colleague).  They are all 20+ years old, and they all work just fine with any EF lens I've tried on them, including Sigma and Tamron, irrespective of age.

The first Canon EOS digital cameras came along in 1995, were EF-mount, and were manufactured by Kodak and sold under the Canon EOS brand.  Canon didn't make their own first DSLR until 2000, when they introduced the D30."

The adapter I use for this is by a company called Gobe, and it only cost a few quid.  No optic is included or required for the adapter, as the flange focal distance is just about right already.  There are loads of M42 lenses that should work with the 6D flawlessly - just got to be careful because some of them protrode slightly far back, and you can have problems with mirror slap.

I found an MC to EF adapter on Amazon UK by Fotodiox which includes a corrective optic, required because the flange focal distance for MC is shorter than is required for EF - basically, the back of the lens would need to be where the mirror is.  On that adapter, the element is removable, which might help with macro photography using adapted MC lenses."

For weddings, a wide angle lens can be good for group photos.  Wide angle lenses are not good for individual portraits though; you're either too far to get much detail of your subject, or so close that the lens distorts the facial features of your subject.  You'd be best to pair that 16-35mm f/4L lens with a 70-200mm f/2.8L, which will give you a fantastically sharp lens for portrait work, with a wide enough aperture for indoor use."
canon,fclpxcl,t3_ehuej4,1577753611.0,"My wife has an EOS M50, and had an EOS 100D (Rebel SL1) prior to that.  Both are crop sensor cameras.

She has the current EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM, which is fantastic - sharp, with nice, fast, and quiet autofocus.

However, I realise you're looking to move to full-frame bodies.  I made the move myself a year ago, and use a 6D.  I wanted a lens we could both use - so here's what we did:  we bought a used **Canon EF 300mm f/4L IS USM**, and a **Canon Extender EF 1.4x II**, both from [CEX](https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail?id=slencanef300mf4&categoryName=camera-lenses&superCatName=electronics&title=canon-ef-300mm-f-4l-is-usm-white-lens) (we're UK-based too).  Ours even came in the original box, with all the packaging, and the Canon L-series lens pouch, and other than being a little bit dirty, it was basically perfect - though I've bought other lenses from CEX that didn't come in the original box, etc - it's just nice when it does happen.

It's a prime lens, rather than a zoom, but because of this, it's superbly sharp.  The Extender gives it an effective focal length of 420mm, and an effective aperture of f/5.6, so there's no effect on the autofocus abilities of any of our cameras.  On her crop-sensor bodies, crop factor makes it the equivalent of a 480mm lens on its own, or 672mm with the Extender.  That's a lot of reach for not a huge amount of money.

It's not too big, not too heavy - fine for hand-held shooting - and it's not too expensive, either - certainly well within your budget.  The USM autofocus system is fast, quiet, and accurate, and the image stabilization is pretty decent too - just remember to turn off IS when using the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM on a tripod.

We use it for bird photos, and we've been very happy with the results.

The only downside is that as it's a prime, you need to position yourself, rather than relying on being able to zoom in or out.  Its minimum focus distance isn't too bad though, so you can use it to get some really good detail shots of things that are fairly close to you.  Maybe pair this with a nice 70-200mm lens."

I have a 6D that is supposedly also weather-sealed, but you're right, it's a rather nebulous term, ""weather resistant""; it's not like they've acquired an IP-rating, or anything.  So I have my camera wrapped up in a silicon cover (which doesn't completely enclose it, just covers over some of the seams where moisture might potentially get in), and avoid using it in wet weather where possible, just in case.

I just wish they would put a weather-sealing gasket on the mount of *all* lenses - not just the L-series lenses.  Not talking about completely weather-sealing the whole lens, just the interface between lens and camera body.  I mean, it's a tiny piece of rubber and shouldn't cost them anything extravagant to include.  And very beneficial to those who have a camera with weather sealing."

canon,fcih98u,t3_eh1e67,1577662514.0,"Typically, Canon doesn't add IS to its wide-aperture lenses - the idea being that an f/1.0 or f/1.2 aperture should let in so much light that longer shutter times are a bit unnecessary, making image stabilization less of a requirement.  If they don't think they need to add it, the lens can be less bulky, less heavy, less complex, and less expensive for them to make.  Look at the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, vs the EF 24-70mm f/4L IS USM - they only put IS in the f/4 version.  That's not a hard-and-fast rule though, and I guess if they want to market these lenses to videographers, they probably should include image stabilization.

I would be extremely surprised if any of their new lenses came without either an USM or STM autofocus system - both USM and STM are very fast and very quiet.  Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Canon have launched any new autofocusing lenses that *don't* feature either USM or STM in at least 5 years.

The good news is that the current crop of RF-mount lenses will likely hold their value pretty well for a while.  You could always buy the RF 15-35mm, and then sell it on later.

Or, you could try to find an EF lens that meets your requirements, and use it via an EF-to-RF adapter, and use this in the interim."
canon,fcaibvn,t3_efyj3v,1577569736.0,"The Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM is the best of the three lenses you mentioned.  Actually, it's superb - sharp, with image stabilization (the only one of the three that has this), and a fast and quiet autofocus system.  If I could use this lens with my EOS 6D, I would.

The Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 Di LD Macro 1:2 is a bargain-bucket lens that is cheaply-made, prone to ghosting/flaring, and has slow and noisy autofocus.  I used to have one, and sold it on once I invested in a better telephoto as a replacement.

The Canon EF 75-300mm is widely considered to be Canon's worst lens.  It's more expensive than the Tamron but not much different in terms of its performance.

Canon have replaced this lens with a much better 70-300mm model - the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM - which is apparently a very good lens.  I haven't had the opportunity to use it personally.  The major advantage this has over the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM is that it can be used on full-frame cameras - so it's the sort of lens you could buy and keep if you upgraded from an EOS Rebel to something like an EOS 6D-series, 5D-series, or 1D-series body, which can't use EF-S lenses.

For street photography on a crop-sensor body like your Rebel T7, I would recommend a focal length around 20 to 24mm - this makes the above lenses less practical for this purpose.  The Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM pancake lens is ideal for street photography work, giving a very natural field of view, and is very sharp, and quite inexpensive - but it's a prime, not a zoom.  If you really want a zoom, I would recommend either:

1)  The Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM

2)  The Sigma EX 17-50mm f/2.8 DC OS HSM

Both these lenses have a wide f/2.8 aperture, and cover the street photography ""sweet spot"" focal length I talked about, whilst also giving you a very useful zoom range - 17mm is pretty wide on a crop-sensor body, and 50mm is portraiture territory.  The maximum aperture stays constant throughout the zoom range, giving you a nice shallow depth of field at any focal length, and allowing you to take shots in low light without too long a shutter time or too high an ISO setting.  That constant maximum aperture is also good for video work.  Both the Sigma and Canon products are image stabilized, too.  Either would be a superb replacement for your kit lens."
