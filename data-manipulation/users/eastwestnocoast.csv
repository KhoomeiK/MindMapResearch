StudentNurse,few9sdh,t1_few1ijs,1579407280.0,"If nursing school was all about BP skills I’d be done, instead I have *checks notes and bank account* a year and a half left and that’s before any grad school. School has always been easy for me and so far, academically , nursing school has not been challenging.Like you, I’m one of those more analytical “oh fuck there’s a person attached to this kidney” type and I’m already considering going the research route but in the short time I’ve been in school learning the personal “soft” skills has by far been the most challenging and the most interesting. What drew me to nursing school is that if i play my cards right I will never get bored, there’s always more opportunities to learn/grow if I choose to do so and, especially with further education, there’s a lot of space for autonomy."

nocontextpics,fec4uby,t1_feb2cmu,1578966671.0,That's honestly what my mind immediately went to before I took a moment to actually think about it. Pokemon GO AR mode is messing with my brain.

Showerthoughts,fe7ww5f,t1_fe7qzv5,1578920018.0,Maslow’s hierarchy touches on exactly this. Can't reach self-actualization if you are worries about putting food in your belly or a roof over your head.
aww,fe7s80l,t1_fe5xx0p,1578918640.0,"I have a cat who was in a nasty car accident with me as I was bringing him to the vet. I was unconscious but the EMTs told me he streaked out when they were getting me out of the car and they thought they saw him make it across 3 lanes of interstate but weren’t sure . After a month and a half of searching with no luck I had to leave the country for a trip. I was pretty despondent and my only hope was that he had made it and found a nice new family. Then I get a message from a lady who had my baby! She had seen my poster a while back, thought the cat she kept seeing outside the restaurant she worked at might be mine, enticed him with bacon, caught him, brought him to the vet to get scanned and got my #. When she found out I was abroad she offered to take care of him until I got back (even though she was allergic) because she didn’t want him to have to stay in a cage. This lady single handedly restored my faith in humanity. When I got back stateside I went to pick him up and when I opened the door to the bathroom that she had turned into a little cat apartment he exploded into the loudest purring ever! My baby is now back with me (curled up on my bed next to me as I type this) and still loves car rides (he acts like a dog and just loves looking out the windows). Anyway, just thought I’d share a happy outcome from a car wreck and lost animal :)"

AnimalsBeingDerps,fe6sl4y,t1_fe61mk7,1578903429.0,I looked for the sound toggle as well and that is the the perfect onomatopoeic spelling of the sound I expected to hear.
Nurse,fe6sgac,t3_eo18cc,1578903247.0,In response to your “first world problems” comment. One thing I’ve learned in school is the therapeutic power of venting. I know I’m extremely fortunate in life but damn sometimes a person has just got to vent. It’s crazy how good I feel after a good vent session and how it can help prevent resentment building up. *Shout out to the couple people in my life who listen to my venting no matter how ridiculous it might get*

I live across the road from a beach that is a local salmon fishing spot and he likes to go and beg for pets from all the fishermen. They get a kick out of seeing a cat hanging out on the beach. My other cat goes down to the beach too but isn’t such an attention whore ha."
