People who I once considered brothers/sisters changed on me and flipped the script.

lonely,fc4k9ks,t3_efyl0p,1577419128.0,"Yeah I feel the same way. Back in High School I use to have friends and go to parties, but I lost contact with most of those people years ago. I have a few friends left but they have interesting stuff going on in their lives so we rarely talk. I'll be lucky to hear from them once a year if that

Now I am this boring shell of a person I use to be who doesn't trust anyone and keeps to themselves"
