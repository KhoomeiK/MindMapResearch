She's part of the generation of fantasy between Tolkien and GRRM who were mediocre writers. I read their books, I enjoyed them, but the genre has gotten so much better since the late 90s. Writers like Hobb, Eddings, Feist, and maybe even Gemmel were good enough non complex but sometimes funny characters in, 2 dimensional worlds. 

After *A Game of Thrones* we got *The Malazan Book of The Fallen*, *Gentlemen Bastards*, all of Mark Lawrence. We got truly impressive world building by the likes of Sanderson (even though his writing is about as good as the previous generation).

I truly don't understand how people consider this good writing. Complete lack of context or Checkov's guns for everything that happens to the main character.

I also recommend *Prince of Thorns* by Mark Lawrence. Mark has a great way of changing his writing style between series to reflect his main characters mind. Some of the books are hilarious. Some of his books are conspicuously lacking comic relief because his protagonist lacks a sense of humor."

history,ff64po7,t1_ff5t4zk,1579619070.0,"A lot probably has to do with the translation. Caesar is writing to the Roman populace. He knew most of the people would be hearing this through public readings. To that end he's speaking in ""common"" language and slang but not so common that he doesn't come off as a patrician.  Slang changes so much from generation to generation now so reading slang from another language 2000 years later means you probably would need to completely change some of his metaphors to modern context in order to truly get his story"
history,ff63wtw,t1_ff52ro0,1579618503.0,"I want to follow up on this with the *why* of it. Caesar's wars in the west were entirely about ""building his brand"". It was basically his version of ""The Apprentice"". His ultimate goal was to pivot off these conquests and then return to Rome in glory. 

Now the question that needs to be asked next is why did this not happen again in other ""barbarian"" regions. There's a lot of reasons but many of them have to do with geography. Caesar realized conquering Scotland and Ireland (or Caledonia and Hibernia) would be more time and effort than was worth it. He had all the propaganda he needed and he wanted to get back to Rome.

The land he did take was relatively easy to hold. Britain is an island with a choke point in the north. None of the other people's in the area were organized enough to stage any kind of land grab and were content with raiding and piracy *or so we were lead to believe by Caesar*. The idea that conquering the last of these lands to the west was of no great merit was an idea that Ceasar  propagated. Later Roman emporors joked that a single legion could take and hold Hibernia, yet they never did.

Meanwhile in Germania any attempts to expand beyond the Rhine and Danube were always temporary. These lands didn't have the natural defences of Britannia, they were thick with terrifying forrest and at their back was The Steppe where periodically new threats would come from the east that would force migrations towards any Roman settlements beyond the Danube and Rhine would be swept back to the rivers.

So to answer the question. Britain was the last great unknown that was ""worth"" conquering while also being defensible enough to hold."

ultimate,fee1060,t3_eomvat,1579024136.0,"I would forget about an ultimate scholarship very quickly. Even if you're one of the best athletes in the country the scholarships are few and far between. On top of that the scholarships are privately funded. That is they're not official university athlete scholarships. As far as your university is concerned you aren't a student athlete. That means you don't get access to the athlete training facilities, dining halls, academic assistance, free clothes etc. The scholarship is generally a financial package that wouldn't cover all of tuition, food, housing like a varsity scholarship would. 

That said letting ultimate influence your college decisions isn't completely ridiculous. Just don't expect it to help fund college. Most major American universities have a strong ultimate community. You can look at the list of past Nationals attendees for an idea of the stronger programs. They also tend to fall in the elite to pretty good academic range. 

Finally. You're worse at ultimate than you think you are. As someone who moved to The US from another country I was quickly made aware that the playing environment in the US is more competitive than everywhere else in the world (unless you're a Columbian woman). This is even more true as you get younger in the US system. YCC teams in the US would probably be competitive for the quarter finals in European international tournaments.

What I was pushing for with the GUPL was that since teams had less intense but more frequent commitments that players traveling 4 hours to play a tournament wouldn't find that appealing for just a single game. 

A big problem I have with clubs is that *so many* of them don't practice *at all*. They tryout, go to tournaments, go to the series, play local summer leagues. I would like to see some sort of a mid week practice requirement (I have no idea how to enforce this but possibly an honesty clause, it being ultimate). 

Though I know you hate my splitting the seasons idea if Mixed had nationals in July and Men's/Women's had nationals in November in a southern state it would accomplish your sectionals timing goal.

>Require that, in order to earn a bid, teams must play at least five games against teams from their region. Additionally, depending on how the numbers shake out, I might require that teams play some number of games against teams in their section (this might not be feasible if the section is only 2-3 teams). This would hopefully push teams to do more local organization.

To piggy back off this, divide the teams in the regions and sections into tiers of 5. require you play each of the teams in your tier at least once before Sectionals. Reward them with a system of byes i.e. a bye to Sunday of Sectionals or straight to regionals, depending on the tier."
ultimate,fedxude,t1_fedt3xx,1579022177.0,"I always though the TCT and in particular the US Open was a dumb concept. One of the crowns is the US Open which has 4 American teams plus 4 international teams. The quality of those international teams is wildly inconsistent year to year. Outside of North America there's only really 3 clubs that are competitive with North American clubs (right now), Buzz Bullets (Japan), Colony (Australia) and Clapham (UK/Europe) and as of 2019 possibly CUSB La Fotta (Italy). If those teams don't come then the teams that do come tend to get destroyed (a similar process happens in women's where Colombia's women's game is competitive with the North American game). These teams also had to fund the trip to the US themselves. In years where there is a WUGC or WUCC this was financially draining since these clubs tended to make up a significant portion of their respective nation's representatives. The US Open always seemed like a way to force ultimate to look more corporate than it is. 

The TCT was stupid to me because Tom Crawford, with very little understanding of what the existing player base put value in, unilaterally declared what the constituents of the Triple Crown were. In other sports ""crowns"" develop over time as the base organically agrees what their sport's most important events are. The Grand Slams in Tennis and Majors in golf weren't appointed from up high. The Kentucky Derby, The Preakness and The Belmont Stakes are The Triple Crown because of their history. The US Open was a tournament that was declared a ""crown"" as was the regular season. To me the two ""crowns"" of American ultimate are Club Nationals Champions and Worlds Champions. 

I really like your idea for a proper US Open and if you're genuinely interested in organizing such an event I'm interesting in collaborating on it with you.

ultimate,feawkp5,t1_fea82jo,1578952924.0,"Cool. I'm never sure if people actually want to engage or just throw shit so I asked. Thanks for responding as you have.

I don't know if I would characterize any of the changes I would suggest as broad or sweeping. Though that's a matter of opinion. 

somewhat by necessity I'm working backwards on your questions 

> Is the goal to move players in rec leagues or other non-USAU-affiliated play into an official competition structure (a la the English Football League system) or is this meant to simply be an expansion of the current club system?

Kind of. I'm not trying to get rid of rec league. Some people really love it and it serves its own point. I am however in recruiting players from rec league into a more competitive eco system. Here's where we run into the first issues though. Where do you take these players coming from rec league, or even sectionals/regionals college level. if you want them to play club do you take them to Terminus or Chesapeake? They'd get stomped. I coach a college developmental team. after coaching these kids for a year I still wouldn't take them to a club tournament. Think on that after a year, of coaching twice a week, there isn't a tournament with a suitable level after the college season ends. What I would propose would be to create a tier under the sectionals level for teams to compete in. I actually tried to do it this fall with the [GUPL](https://sites.google.com/view/gupl/home). It didn't work on the first attempt but I may try again.

> What are the reasons people play elite or competitive college ultimate but then don't continue to play at the club level?

My guess is that the jump is so high that unless your good enough to make a perennial Nationals club that there isn't any emotional pay off for all the hard work you would have to do. Imagine a video game. Why do people keep playing them. Games hack our brain chemistry and give us little emotional rewards with incremental wins when we level up to keep us going between the big wins of beating the game or the level or advancing a tier in an e-sport.

> What benefits can/should we provide to incentivize the creation of new teams?

The greater number of tiers would mean that we could make more winners every season. You wouldn't be afraid to take novice players to this competition because it would be their level. You incentivize by removing the disincentive. I have found over the years that ultimate and competing are their own incentives if you have a healthy environment to compete in.

> And how can we structure these to avoid cannibalizing older teams?

You would seed the existing teams into the higher tiers. That way they don't have to play against beginner teams until those teams level up.

>What benefits can/should we provide to existing teams to incentivize their continued existence? 

one way would be that teams would earn their right to stay in their tier. to play in the next season you had to have played and not been relegated the previous season. To stay playing we gradually implement good governance requirements. 
* have a committee
* have regular practice
* have a treasurer
* have a club bank account
* have a youth team 
* register as a legal entity 
* have a youth safety policy that meets a certain standard 
etc. 

you could also add a carrot to the stick of say waived USAU membership fees for the club that hits the most of these targets in your region.

This system has worked in other sports in other countries and even works in ultimate in other countries. The UK has a national league that meets 3 times a year at a series of tournaments called ""Tour"". There is A, B and C Tour and you can earn promotion and relegation between them. I'm not saying we copy that system exactly but I think we should look to it for inspiration."

ultimate,feaahpc,t1_fea95c6,1578946290.0,"The only sports I know of are racket sports and dancing/figure skating. In tennis team competition has matches where you play doubles and singles rounds for points so you would have to play both mixed and single gender. 

The UK staggers it's ultimate season for mixed and single gender. Mixed in the spring, single gender in the summer. The result it a competitive scene for all 3 divisions."

ultimate,fea8rp5,t1_fea2ko3,1578945705.0,"Totally.  There's only one stat that matters as they say and Sweden won this game fair and square. I don't want to make this out to be an injustice because it wasn't. It was an interesting adaptation to the conditions.

The Swedes intentionally didn't catch the pulls and their off field players lined up 3 m behind their end zone line to stop any disc from flying out the back. This let the Swedish handler get the disc and sprint up to the front of the end zone before the Japanese defense could get fully set."

ultimate,fea3nmr,t1_fe9zkav,1578944020.0,Are these organized clubs or draft seasonal teams?
ultimate,fea3b1p,t1_fea0fna,1578943911.0,That's a fair point. You could make it a gradual progression though. It's happened in other sports so we know it can be done.
ultimate,fea312e,t1_fe9z6fk,1578943836.0,"the counter argument is women are being pressured into choosing mixed over women's by men who want women on their team and women shouldn't be pressured into making a choice.

you couldn't do two teams because you're thinking of the context of the current system where those seasons are concurrent. I'm proposing that they be held at different times of year."
ultimate,fea2357,t1_fe9k6ck,1578943566.0,">This is a buzzword statement. How do we do this concretely? What benefits would an existing club receive. Right now they tend to get preference from existing tournaments (or ones they played at previously), but are you talking about a stipend? Cheaper membership fees? (which would imply more expensive new member fees)<

I have lots of actual suggestions for how to accomplish this. I've actually talked a lot about it on other posts. I intentionally didn't include in in this post  because I didn't want to get hung up on smaller details, rather put focus on the problems at hand. 

I'm also an extremely experienced organizer in ultimate, all those bonefides are elsewhere if you want to look me up. 

If you actually want to discuss it I will, however it would be a long post and I'm not interested in debating with someone not who isn't willing to argue in good faith. Are you genuinely interested?"
ultimate,fe9yvyf,t1_fe9nnkf,1578942642.0,"My suggestion, alluded to above, would be to require good governance for teams to continue playing in the series.

Your point on European soccer doesn't standup to the factual reality. The [English FA Leave System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system) has 140 leagues with 480 divisions and 5,300 clubs that are members of these leagues. As European soccer got more competitive at the elite level tiers were created below them to accommodate player ability and more and more competitive layers."

ultimate,fe9mqmf,t1_fe9ju67,1578939485.0,I think a D II nationals for club wouldn't help the problem. It would just continue the financial elitism that we see now. What I would prefer is to see stronger competition structures based on a more regional system. The best teams in the country compete in the national series. I would like to see the teams below them compete in a regional league that feeds into the national series.
ultimate,fe9lv9h,t1_fe9l3bp,1578939277.0,"If elite play is satisfied with the AUDL then USAU should focus on amateur competitive level. Give playing opportunities between elite club and casual league.

ultimate,fe9l1ol,t1_fe9jk5m,1578938899.0,Yeah the TCT tiering system kind of encouraged you to keep going year on year but forced a lot of financial and travel obligations on teams. I think any restructuring of the tiering system should consider this.

As to your point on the lack of specificity to the changes. I have a lot of ideas on how I would change things. I've posted about these ideas in the past if you want to look at some of my history. I intentionally didn't get bogged down in the specifics because people tend to focus on nit picks instead of looking at the problem we need to address in the first place. 

The first thing I want to convince people of is a need to make changes. after that we can talk turkey on how to make those changes."
