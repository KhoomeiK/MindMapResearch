Femdom,ffhd0x3,t3_esn1po,1579930385.0,Not to be a kink shamer but...that seems incredibly dangerous. Actually fuck it I'm kink shaming. This is just horrifying. No.
mixingmastering,ffff9ao,t3_etb04z,1579882685.0,"You just gotta avoid mixing with your eyes. Maybe try using EQ's that just have knobs and don't show you a curve, so you can't see what your EQ looks like. This will allow you to use your ears to focus on what your EQ is doing, instead of using your eyes to find a curve that ""looks"" good."
RoleReversal,ffec8ez,t1_ffbhcv5,1579842833.0,Honestly there's something special about a girl who's significantly smaller than you but still able to maintain complete control.
RoleReversal,ffb4lt9,t1_ffb4cln,1579751649.0,That's great lol
RoleReversal,ffb1hi8,t1_ff9tei0,1579749442.0,That's something I would do lol

Guitar,ff20v7c,t3_er73it,1579490809.0,"If you're not going to utilize the Floyd on the guitar a lot then it's not worth it. It's not difficult to maintain a Floyd if you know what you're doing, but it can still be a pain in the ass to tune it and restring it regardless."
Guitar,ff20jr5,t3_er754n,1579490578.0,"Try loosely wrapping a sock or something like that around the strings past the nut (between the nut and the tuning pegs), and see if you still get that ringing. And also make sure the other strings are muted when doing this, because it could be that another string is ringing out in response to that specific note."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff0w98h,t1_ff0o7f5,1579472857.0,"Not really, a lot of straight girls will compliment each other on their looks, much more so than straight guys. And as a straight guy I am able to admit that a guy may be ""attractive"" without actually being *attracted* to him, if that makes sense. I don't feel like my sexuality is in question because of this, because I don't feel any strong attraction towards any men."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff0nh0f,t3_er2wev,1579470557.0,"I would say it's definitely possible that you're at least bi. Nothing wrong with that, so I wouldn't worry too much about whether it's ""normal."""

gojira,feiwm4v,t1_feirs9y,1579149213.0,"I've been playing for 5-6ish years, but not consistently. I use my middle finger for this bend in particular, and I guess I just curl my finger in the direction of the bend? Maybe I'm holding back cuz I'm afraid of snapping a string lol"
musictheory,feiqhu6,t3_epda49,1579144673.0,"Maybe try just using those four chords on a loop throughout the song. Instead of making a new progression for the chorus or bridge or whatever, just make changes to the instrumentation, dynamics, or even tempo/meter of the song.

That might help you be able to write a full-length song without needing to write a bunch of unique parts.

At the end of the day, you're gonna have to write full songs. Even if they're bad. Actually, ESPECIALLY if they're bad. If you make enough bad songs, you'll likely start to figure out what makes something bad or good, and you'll slowly start making better music. Don't stop making music.

Nobody writes good songs at first. The key is to write them anyways. You don't have to share your bad songs with anybody, and you'll thank yourself later once your songwriting improves."

TrueOffMyChest,fdxrqe8,t3_enc5eb,1578772248.0,"Honestly I've seen both sides of the spectrum. Every social media platform is an echo chamber to an extent. People accept things they want to see and reject things they don't, regardless of what the truth actually is. Both parties have WAAAYYY more similarities than differences, but they act like they are mortal enemies at war with each other just so they can get more votes. In reality neither party cares about their voters, all they care about is getting votes."

TrueOffMyChest,fdrm96a,t3_emuzg2,1578686476.0,If you raise a child correctly then you'll never have to hit them. Physical violence (including light slaps and stuff) is a last resort tactic used by parents who don't know how to properly teach their children how to behave. There's no legitimate reason to hit your child.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdpm02j,t3_emm58l,1578632396.0,That's not how this works.

RoleReversal,fdfzuks,t3_ekpgfx,1578375003.0,"I briefly talked to a girl once who called me ""sweet boy."" Honestly I'm a sucker for really dumb and mushy names. The worse, the better IMO.

musictheory,fcsv2sr,t3_eiqj19,1577925851.0,"C major and A minor have different tonal centers, so a piece in C major will establish C as the ""home"" pitch, but A minor uses A. So each note/chord will behave differently even though the notes are the same. Plus, in A minor you will often see an E major chord (or an E7), because the G# pulls you back to A."
