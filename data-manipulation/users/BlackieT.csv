AgingParents,ffpqybu,t3_euge3i,1580102590.0,"A lot of older people keep used cooking grease (bacon fat, etc.) in a container around the stove.  It goes rancid and collects insects if the lid isn’t on correctly.  They may keep it in a skillet on the stove..  They may not know if they can’t see well.

If they have a tea kettle, try to clean it out.  It’s had the same 3” in the bottom since the day they bought it in 1968.

Check expiration dates on cans in the cupboard.  My mom had a can of food that had expired 12 years ago!

Check the canisters of flour and sugar for little bugs.  They may not be able to see them.

Check throw rugs to make sure none of the edges are curled up , and that they don’t slide across the floor.  Huge trip hazard."
Advice,ffppwqs,t3_euh0ud,1580101620.0,"Does she go to the doctor at all?  For other reasons?  You can call and ask for her doctor to call you back - or you can mail him a note.  Tell the doctor the problem she’s having, but she won’t admit it.  He can take care of it, at her next appointment, and she won’t even realize it.   You can always talk to her doctor.  He can’t reveal any medical info about her without a signed authorization from her, though."

dementia,ffeco2w,t3_esgk15,1579843236.0,"You need to call her doctor’s office and ask for him to call you back.  When he calls, have an attitude and insist that she be put on medication right away. The doctor will keep putting it off until you call him on it.  My dad’s doctor did the same thing.  Good luck hun."

AgingParents,ff21kup,t3_eqx7hm,1579491332.0,It could be a vicious cycle: he’s afraid to go to the bathroom during the night - so he doesn’t drink enough during the day - which leads to dehydration and a UTI.

Advice,ff1wq6j,t3_er28t3,1579487923.0,"If it was my BEST friend, I would sit down and ask ALL the details: how they met, what’s he like, what’s your favorite thing about him, etc.  She should be dying to tell you everything.  Ask a lot of questions, work in some about his siblings, what are they like (oh, you haven’t met them yet?), are his parents nice (they were the one time you saw them, ok), where will you live? Maybe, just maybe, you can bring her down from her high long enough to realize that she doesn’t know much about the person she is about to marry."

dementia,fewjgo0,t3_eqndok,1579411856.0,"The sad part is that since he has Parkinson’s, it’s really unlikely that his handwriting is going to get better. Smaller handwriting is one of the hallmark symptoms of the disease.  On the other hand, it gives him something to do."
dementia,fewiw4e,t3_eqnxd1,1579411449.0,"You could try Senna-S, it’s a laxative.  Make sure you get the one that has the  -S, that means it has a stimulant to push the fecal matter through her bowels and out.  Maximum dose is 8 pills a day.  Start at 2 or 3 a day until you hit the magic number. I don’t know if she’s on any medications, but a lot of them are constipating, so that could be the cause.  My Dad takes 6 a day because he is on several medications with that side effect.

It is not safe for her to strain for that long.  That’s a good way to pass out or even have a stroke.  When you strain, you press on the vasovagel nerve that runs up the spinal column to the brain.  So you should start her on the Senna-S as soon as you can, if she really can’t poop.  Not matter the results of the scan."
dementia,fewhrxj,t1_feuwric,1579410813.0,"Take all of her regular underwear out of her drawer and put pull-ups in there instead.  Therapeutic fib: the doctor wants you to wear these, so you don’t get an UTI :)"
dementia,fewhdga,t3_eqhpcf,1579410604.0,"Do you have teenagers?  Ever hear “I hate you!”  Same thing here.  Emotions running wild, no filters.  She doesn’t mean it, anymore than a teenager means it when you’re being mean to them.  Just remember that her brain is broken. What comes out of her mouth essentially makes no sense and is not tied to the truth."

Alzheimers,few7mui,t3_eqi9tl,1579406503.0,"You an ALWAYS talk to your Dad’s doctor.  Your Dad’s doctor can’t talk to you without signed paperwork, giving him permission.  So, yes, he can listen to whatever you want to say.  That is what you should do.  Call him or email him and explain that you just spent a week taking care of him.  And also the scene when they were reunited.  But it sounds like he definitely needs something stronger for his anxiety.  Imagine how terrible it must feel to be inside his body.  We just had to do this for my Dad.  He is so much better now.  Good luck."
Advice,few5l11,t3_eqq0k8,1579405728.0,"Your Mom can call your local Area on Aging Agency (every county has one).  They can put her in touch with some licensed care agencies.  The benefit of care agencies is that their employees have been trained and vetted, and the agency does all of the paperwork and withhold the taxes.  She will need to stand firm on the schedule she wants.

That’s the best option if she is reluctant to go with a private care aid, like from an ad in the paper or a post online.  However, I do believe that care.com also vets the people listed there, so that may relieve her mind a bit if she runs into any snags with the care agencies.   

The aide certainly didn’t give you much notice, did she?  I hope it all works out smoothly and you have a new aide starting soon!"

But you can get through it and come out the other side stronger.  I learned to compartmentalize the traumatic stuff, lock it away in a part of my brain, so it wasn’t front and center to drive me crazy all the time. May not be the way professionals would recommend, but it worked for me."

What will it do to their marriage?  It needs to be a secret among you kids, unless one of your parents bring it up first.

If you are just dying to talk to someone, talk to your Mom about it.  She’s the one who screwed up.  Don’t break your Dad’s heart.  That’s her job."
