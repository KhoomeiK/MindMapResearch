“...Look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said, we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't know if we know it was Russia who broke into the DNC.

She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was. It could also be China, it could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. You don't know who broke into DNC, but what did we learn? We learn that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people. By Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with an internet, we came up with the internet.

And I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a, it is a huge problem. I have a son.

He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly do-able. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing, but that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester and certainly cyber is one of them.”"

“Is my product an extract or a concentrate?

Whether your product is an extract or a concentrate depends on how it was manufactured. It’s a concentrate if the process to make the product:

• Is mechanical;
• Uses carbon dioxide without any high heat or pressure (e.g. dry ice); or

• Uses water, vegetable glycerin, vegetable oils, animal fats, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, or other
non-hydrocarbon solvents. 

It’s an extract if the process:

• Uses carbon dioxide with high heat or pressure (carbon dioxide acting as a solvent); or

• Uses a hydrocarbon-based solvent like butane, hexane or propane.”
