rpghorrorstories,ffddi8r,t1_ffdah4e,1579818594.0,"Playing online might make it easier for cringey AF DMs to pull this shit, but it's certainly not a requirement.

I once played in a face-to-face game (in a private house, college roommate-style set up) where the DM announced my character (a) had a girlfriend ""back home"" - without us ever having discussed it - and (b) declared that said girlfriend had a bun in the oven as a means to railroad my character into his plotline.  My character had been out adventuring for gods only know how long and had not been in communication, magical or otherwise, with this ""girlfriend"" (on account of her not existing until this moment.)  But suddenly, I knew she existed, was pregnant, and there was no questioning that my character was the father.  He didn't even role-play someone delivering a scroll or some messaging spell going off.  I just fucking knew this information all of a sudden.

I didn't go back for the next session.

I did remain friends and continue gaming with some of the other people who lived in that house for years after, but I didn't talk to that DM anymore.  (To the surprise of no one here, I'm sure, he didn't come out of his room very often.  So, even though I would go and hang out fairly regularly with the cool kids, I hardly ever saw him.  The question of rejoining his game never came up - I'm not even sure it continued after I left TBH.)"

If you wanted to keep dupes from one specific platform (say, Steam) visible and hide everything from other platforms, you could further speed this process by filtering to show only the dupes on the platforms you want hidden, then you could get longer stretches with SHIFT+click at once, without needing to ""leapfrog"" over the one copy of a game you want left visible.

At the end of the day, either I liked the game or I didn't; I couldn't care less what ""everyone"" thought about it.

I do, of course, read reviews when shopping for a new game, but I tend to focus on reviews that give me objective details about the game, so I can decide for myself if what they're saying sounds good (or bad, in the case of negative reviews.)

The players who are present control those who are absent by consensus and all characters continue to receive XP/treasure as usual (after all, their characters are still at risk, so they still get a reward.)

In my experience, the quickest way to kill a campaign is to stop playing.  If one person is absent this week and someone else is absent the next week... it doesn't take long before a month has gone by and people are out of the habit of making time on game night."

There's also the question of how well other aspects of a game are built, like gameplay, story, etc.  At the end of the day, pretty graphics don't make a game *fun* \- they make it *pretty*.  Sure, pretty graphics are nice to look at, and can generate a lot of excitement initially, but they don't necessarily carry a game long-term.

So, if the devs of a particular game focus too much on graphics and not enough on actual gameplay, that can lead to players noticing more of these immersion-breaking issues, I think.  Conversely, if a game is *fun to play* with maybe not-so-hot graphics, people will get immersed in the gameplay and not notice the graphical issues as much."

I feel so strongly about this that there are a number of series I just haven't played, because I skipped the early titles and can't be bothered going back to the beginning just to catch up to the current entry.  Maybe I am missing out on some good franchises due to this, but honestly, I'm not running short on games to play as it is, so I don't mind too much.

As an example, the first Witcher game was a real slog, in terms of controls.  I pushed myself on that one.  But in the end, I'm glad I did.  I enjoyed the story, even though many assured me I don't need to know it.  They aren't wrong, it's totally skippable, but I enjoyed it on its own, and the context it added to the next two games in the series made the world more vivacious and intriguing as I continued.  I also enjoyed starting Witcher 2 with a savegame to read from.

Edit: The big exception to this rule is reboots.  If a franchise is being hard rebooted, I'm cool starting at the first of teh new continuity.  For example, the Tomb Raider series.

Then, just before that story is about to get really going, it transforms into.... something else.  Some animated acid trip that I'm still not entirely sure what it was going on about.

To me, this is one of the primary differentiators of games as a story-telling medium versus other formats like movies and books, Hellblade being a particularly poignant example, but hardly the only one.  It's not about whether the story *could* be told in another format, but the fact that I, as a player, have to take action and make choices.  I have to push the button.  I have to open the door.

It makes the story more personal, at least when it's done right.  If my choices actually *change* something along the way then so much the better, but even in an entirely linear story, that added personal involvement draws me in to the story being told.

People report in their times and (I assume) what style of play they were going for (Main Story only, Main + Extra, or Completionist.)  I usually play games with a ""Main + Extra"" attitude - I will do side quests, I will keep an eye out for secrets, but I'm not going through the game with a fine-toothed comb.  If I miss some stuff, whatever.

As far as my own time compared to HLTB, I find that I'm usually a couple hours slower than the average, because like you, I'm in no rush.  This also varies by game genre.  For example, with stealth games I tend to take WAY longer than estimated, because I enjoy playing super stealthy - like, sneak past people without even KOing them whenever possible.  For games with lots of crafting/grinding, I tend to be a little faster than average, because I don't really grind more than I absolutely need to progress.

HLTB says that 2013 Tomb Raider takes 15.5h if you're playing ""Main + Extra"" or 20h for ""Completionist.""  So, 24 hours if you're taking your time and enjoying the scenery doesn't sound *that far off* to me."

Once they have that money, mission accomplished.

Even if you do notice AND you have enough gumption to do something about it, you're literally 1 email out of 1,000,000.  No one is going to sweat the revenue lost from you wising up.  Even the next guy who bought the data and plans to spam you with offers probably doesn't care about this trick.  Again, you're 1 in a 1,000,000.

Figure out what that thing is, and get it out of the way.  No one should be at the table if they don't want to be, and not wanting to actually do what the game entails suggests they don't want to be there.

If they find themselves overwhelmed by the options available, then figure out why and what you can do to alleviate it.  Making flash cards that summarize races and classes can be helpful (let them worry about learning all the details after they've chosen one.)  Asking them what sort of story they want to tell and waht kind of movie character they want to be can help bring roleplaying options into focus (try to keep the discussion centered around movies/tv shows that are similar to the game and setting you plan to run.)"

That being said, I do recognize that Galaxy 2.0 is still technically in beta, and so major features are still being tested/added.  Thus, as I have said many times now, I will continue to keep an eye on Galaxy, and if/when it can do what Playnite does, I will reconsider which one I want to use."

Plus the fact that it detects *motion*, meaning enemies who aren't moving won't register, even if they're right outside your hidey hole.  Very immersive and suspenseful.

\- The cloning tanks in Stasis were pretty gross, just from an artwork perspective.  Also, the whole scene where you have to surgically remove>! the PDT from your own spinal cord.!<  Very contrived, but effective.  I would recommend Stasis (and its sequel Cayne) to fans of the horror genre.  Most horror video games seem to go for the suspense/tension angle (and the ever-famous jump scare), probably because non-horror games have a solid history of blood and gore anyway.
