This extends to like, board games and in real life rpgs as well - it's his thing and not mine. Now we have two kids and they are 8 and 11 and both are obsessed with Pokemon. They have been for years - the cards, the shows, then the video games... me, I never got into that stuff even when I tried. Thing is, our youngest has just been diagnosed with ADD and is pursuing testing for ASD. So when I say he's obsessed with Pokemon I MEAN IT. SO. HARD. He will literally talk to me about pokemon for HOURS, following me around the house monologuing about it. But I didn't know anything about it it didn't make sense to me at all - until I got the Pokemon Go app on my phone. At first it was just a fun thing to show the kids. Now I actively play and study up on the best things to do and I know where all the pokestops around me are and how to battle, I go for walks encouraged by the game, we took a trip specifically to a certain place JUST to go pokemon hunting... and all through it - my son gets to be my coach which he loves and now I can be an active listener when he tells me about this stuff, even contribute my own bits to the conversation. It is an amazing game for a non gamer to use to connect w their kids.
