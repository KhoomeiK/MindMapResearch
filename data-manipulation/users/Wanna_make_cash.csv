Showerthoughts,ffvagu9,t1_ffv4gvq,1580259520.0,Took calc 2 and DiffEq(albeit it was the engineering version of the course and not the pure math theory version) and I've never seen a problem that complex or anywhere near that. Plus all my professors in any class either A) allow integral tables or B) just give us the general form of the integral in a problem if it requires integration by parts or is more complex than the commonly memorizes integrals

DestinyTheGame,ffiiiog,t1_ffdidid,1579974684.0,I love that gearbox can do weekly balance and bugfixing hotfixes (and monthly patches) for borderlands 3 and then bungie struggles to get literally anything pushed as an update in an entire month and sometimes it's just a handful of bug fixes and nothing else that month.
DestinyTheGame,ffii7vl,t1_fff1jmj,1579974476.0,"The thing is,in software development, the people fixing the bugs and the people designing new stuff and the people balancing current stuff should be all different people. There's no reason they can't simultaneously fix bugs and balance crucible. I doubt bungie assigns literally every single programmer they have employed to fixing a bug before ANYTHING else can happen. It's like they send out a mass email ""Dear employees, even if your job is Crucible design and balance, you must spend the next week fixing a bug where if a player jumps off a specific cliff in shatettered throne doing a 360 while wearing peregrine greaves, the game crashes. DEDICATE EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF YOUR TIME TO THIS ISSUE UNTIL ITS FIXED""

I'm just saying the bug fixers in companies usually arent the same people doing balance and thus they usually happen side by side in other games. Guess bungie is different"
DestinyTheGame,ffihofe,t1_ffdlzzi,1579974113.0,"After all these years it's become pretty apparent that bungie moves slower than a slug in a pool of molasses, unless it's a bug that can very easily be fixed (which usually coincides with eververse issues or just disabling gear and then taking weeks to actually fix it). I've given up on ever seeing any sort of return on feedback until 5-8 months minimum. Luke Smith said back in his shadowkeep state of the games that they almost can never take feedback from one season and apply it next season because they're usually making stuff at the same time like reckoning and black armory forges were being made close to eachother and it was far too late to apply feedback from BA to the reckoning."

I absolutely hate this seasonal model. I loved having the ability to take a break and come back to LOADS of content that I can sink my teeth into for a solid few months. I took a break around a month before black armory released. I came back with season of opulence. I had THREE SEASONS of content to sink my teeth into. I was playing almost every day until shadowkeep launched and then that kept me busy until around November at which point the blandness of vex offensive began to rub off on me.
