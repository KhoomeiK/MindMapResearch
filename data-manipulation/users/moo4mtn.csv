I'm voting for election reform, I'm canvassing for a national popular vote, I'm texting and calling and knocking on doors to listen to what people want and creating momentum for change. People don't think things can change because they've forgotten there are ways to make their voice heard. While you sit doing nothing but saying, ""Oh well. Nothing we can do.""

politics,ff3zgsy,t1_ff3yjya,1579552232.0,"They frame the conversations. They have an agenda, just like when they conspired agaisnt the progressive running last time and they leaked emails proving it. Almost all of the superdelegates pledged to vote for the centrist regardless of the popular vote, throwing the perception of how close the primaries were off. We'd be having a very different conversation if those superdelegates weren't factored into the numbers portrayed as gospel on MSM. Hopefully that changes this election. 

But again. Simply telling me Person A is a criminal, so you should vote for Person B who doesn't reflect your values or America's needs at all so that the criminal isn't elected, isn't a good reason. What happens when the next election they run another candidate who is better at being a cri.inal because we just let the establishment exist as is?

The reason Trump was elected is that our political system is corrupt. Both sides of it. The money from corporations influence their policies. They spin us this tale of incremental changes and how things are better when Party B is in power, but they're not. People are dying from lack of good healthcare, stagnant wages, housing prices have skyrocketed and we have nothing to show for voting in moderate candidates. The system doesn't care about you unless you're a billionaire or unless they can convince you to put them in power. We have the power to change that. Let's use it instead of just throwing up our hands and saying, ""Well things are bad but they're always going to be this bad so let's not make them worse!"" That's how things have gotten worse."

If none of the other candidates get 15% of the vote, the delegates are split 50-50 between the two, not 20-20-10-10-14-11-1-14. I think Bernie has a much better chance of winning in Iowa than polling has shown so far, and if he starts out strong, he can build on that momentum.
