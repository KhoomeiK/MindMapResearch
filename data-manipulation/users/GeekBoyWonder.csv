You will be good teacher or not- and will like it or not. It’s a tough reality, but you will know pretty quickly if this is the gig for you.

To get along as a teacher, 3 rules:

Get your paperwork done on time, every time.

Take care of the janitorial,  secretarial and food service staff.

Stay the hell out of the teacher’s lounge drama.


My additional 3 ideas:

Honesty.  Always Honesty. You cant expect a human to believe you about technical stuff if you cant be believed abut other stuff. So be honest about being new and the associated anxiety. You will be amazed at how quickly (some of) the students become your champions as well.

Respect. Respect is about what you expect- so be clear and consistent in how you run things.  I devote class time to describing my expectations... including having those details on quizzes.

Balance. You could spend 24/7 on teachery things and not get done. If you are swallowed up by the idea that you should be doing teacher stuff, you will burn out and grow to resent your job and worse, your students


Also- find a mentor.  Within your organization or elsewhere.  You will need a a coach, cheerleader and whinery (that place you get to go unload).

Criticism- I tell myself and my students this ‘Don’t accept criticism from someone you wouldn’t ask for advice.’ 
I would encourage you to NOT fake a different personal style... for many many reasons.  Primarily, your students deserve an honest human at the front of the room.

Question- you said you didn’t enjoy student teaching.  Was there a time or lesson or part of a lesson that you did feel the magic?"

The teaching part will work for you or it won’t. It’s a rough truth. You will know pretty quickly if this is the gig for you.

Now, to get along- 3 rules

1) Get your paperwork in on time.
2) Take care of the janitorial, secretarial and food service staff.
3) Keep the hell out of the teachers lounge drama.


And my maxims
1) Honesty.  Always honesty.  You can’t BS a student about one thing and ask them to understand another as truth. 
2) Respect.  Respect is a function of what you expect- and is taught by how you lead. This means consistency- early in a semester, I plan on as much as 15% of my class time to be spent discussing specific expectations. 
3) Balance.  If every waking hour and minute is spent on teachy stuff, you’re doing it wrong.  It’s easy to become completely swallowed up by teaching- 24/7 you ‘could’ be preparing, researching, grading, and still not get done. You will grow to resent your career if you do this, and you won’t have new ideas showing up for you.  And you are a human that gets to enjoy other stuff- or not doing anything at all. A life in teaching is not a life of only teaching.
