PublicFreakout,fesvynz,t1_fcnc5sq,1579369582.0,The problem with this is they have to charge you for the water but most fast food restraunts dont have an option for that on the register so they charge you for something else that is the same price. He wasnt supposed to get a mcdlurry and they knew he didn't order one. Its Just how the registers are made. Not their fault. However her reaction was highly inappropriate. That much is very true

GTAorRussia,feokymm,t1_feojp4c,1579301561.0,They didnt disclose that information but I assume they were seized from her. There is no way she was given the dogs back. Probobly already readopted by now
GTAorRussia,fen070b,t3_epwwdu,1579274018.0,"*BACKGROUND ON WHAT HAPPENED* (just in case people dont know)

The lady driving stole the RV and decided to drive recklessly and under the influence. She proceeed to try and outrun multiple cops in a high speed chase through a residential area. She took out a fence and was aiming for people on the street. The whole time she had her 2 dogs in the RV with her. When she hit the tree one dog jumped out the side where it ran to a neighboring house but the other dog did not make it out because she grabbed it. When the lady let go to drive the dog jumped out the windshueld at full speed. Both dogs were fine. The lady was arrested and is probibly still in jail. This happened mid-last year. Hope this helps!"

Lion looks like a very good dog. And so what if he is aggressive? (not saying he is, just hypothetical) my dog was a fight dog in Florida and used to attack me on a daily basis, but now he is the sweetest pupper who sniffs babies and plays with puppies!"
PublicFreakout,fcnboa8,t3_ehkx6i,1577808193.0,I have people who do things like this to me because we are not allowed to give away free cups of water at my job (I know its rediculous). People need to grow up and pay their 99cents. Its not like we control it. We only work there. This guy is a huge part of the problem
dogs,fclqzzv,t3_eho07v,1577754355.0,"Hi, so, for me personally, getting a dog has changed my life. I have Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, and Paranoia disorders. Before I rescued my dog ,Itus (named after the greek god of protection), I was in constant fear for my life due to the Paranoia/Anxiety and had suicidal thoughts. After I got Itus I slowly got a little better. All the work I had to put into making him happy distracted me from myself and they unconditional love he gave in return helped boost my serotonin levels daily. My cats have also helped me allot as well. I hope this helps."
