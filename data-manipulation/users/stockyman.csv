DaveRamsey,fffpxdx,t1_fffo3up,1579889245.0,Niceeeee. I am in a similar situation.

DaveRamsey,fffmx1b,t1_fffmin4,1579887407.0,"Yeah, 25% of net is tough but it is doable if you look for a great deal in housing. I rented a room in central CA for 4 years in college and I paid $375 with everything included except food and my personal expenses. It was amazing."
DaveRamsey,fffmojb,t1_fffkxlh,1579887262.0,"I think so too. It truly is supply and demand. If you owned a home, you'd probably increase it too given that the rent around you is higher. Maybe if I was renting to friends, I would not increase it but anyone else, I would."

DaveRamsey,fffma9z,t1_ffflage,1579887017.0,Nice. Some questions about your home ownership if you don't mind me asking. How much was the house? How much did you put down? And do you set money aside for maintenance for the near future? I dream of owning a home in the next 3 years.
DaveRamsey,fffm5da,t1_ffflg6x,1579886935.0,What is coop maintenance? The $875 with utilities inc. is great actually.
DaveRamsey,fffm33o,t1_ffflr6s,1579886898.0,"Oh man. That is steep. Do you love being so close to the most exciting city on Earth? It's many people's dream to live there and for $1,775 per person in a 2b/2b is not tooooo bad. I would do it."

DaveRamsey,fffkp7n,t1_fffib37,1579886051.0,"Apartment? I used to pay $1,200 for a studio. It was fine but it gets tiring after a while once you hear of people paying $700 for rooms with utilities included. haha"

DaveRamsey,fffkep6,t1_fffj2dt,1579885870.0,"Is the $650 for the studio considered expensive in your city? I used to live in a studio also in OC for $1,200 and it was in the middle of a homeless congregation area. I never felt unsafe but bringing guests was always a task since I had to reiterate that they don't do anything. They just hang out."
DaveRamsey,fffk18a,t1_fffjbc4,1579885633.0,"Oh man. That is definitely painful when they increase it. In the expensive areas of California, they just increase it every year by $25-100. Living with your boyfriend will save you tons. Hopefully you can get him to join your Dave R. movement. :D"

mathematics,fffh7xq,t1_ffeanbu,1579883898.0,"Nice. If you plan on going deeper into math I would recommend that you open your mind to many many subjects. There's a beauty in each. Math is very fulfilling to me but thinking about philosophy, psychology, chemistry, physics, improv in theater, music class, and others will give you a well rounded mind that you'll be thankful for in your adulthood. Just make the most of every single subject the school system exposes you to."
mathematics,fffguiu,t1_ffeyf37,1579883668.0,"Nice. I noticed when I was an undegrad that many mathematicians were also great philosophers and had plenty of input in areas of psychology, sociology, and economics.

mathematics,fffgkd6,t1_fff74i7,1579883491.0,"I can fully relate to your professor and your own affinity for philosophy. If you liked how that class taught you to persuade people in different ways, you should absolutely try Mad Men. The TV show. When I watched the entire series, I was struggling to land a job after graduating in pure math. I learned from the show that people will do anything if you say the right words in the right way. It made me extremely assertive and persuasive. It showed on my interviews after because I got compliments on how compelling I was. Also, on stoicism...look into Seneca. More precisely, this summary of his idea by a modern practitioner of philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuDAfU3uj6o

It will reinforce some of the ideas you already have and it will most likely give you new insights on anger, patience, and happiness. 
Thank you for taking the time to answer this question of mine."
mathematics,fffezwm,t1_fff8re7,1579882521.0,"Nice. I'm happy you were able to make the most of that class. Very often, I saw my fellow math major classmates who complained about every gen ed class they were ""forced"" to take. They never saw anything good in them. I loved taking all the gen ed classes because it exposed me to topic I would have never thought about if I wasn't in those classrooms. One was jazz appreciation, improv class, and every philosophy class I took as my minor. They all gave me something to keep even after college."

She does invite me over but once we are there in her place, there's almost no physical touch and just lots of laughs and good talks.

NoStupidQuestions,feq6hqx,t3_eqe4jb,1579338206.0,Maybe WWIII actually occurs in a few years into his second term. The reality is that whoever wins will make a good portion of the people in the US unhappy. Satisfying everyone is not possible since we all have different expectations and inclinations. You'll hear complaints regardless of the winner. The only difference will be where they will come from.
AskReddit,feq5tpu,t3_eqe4sz,1579338058.0,"Hope is usually linked to over optimistic notions on almost anything. The universe does not function on hope or pleasing anyone's expectations. That is why it is usually a good way to be disappointed. The only way to truly get what you expect is to be as realistic as possible. You can be optimistic but you have to accept that tragedy will occur. It's guaranteed. Now, this does NOT apply to women only. I am referring to ""hope"" in general."

So you don't explicitly say you or others following this lifestyle are better but it is essentially implied in your text. The general message is that you are in a better position than someone who isn't planning for their future. Most people on this subreddit would agree with you here because that's what they believe in as well. My objection was more in the idea that there's one path to follow and that is the best. In reality, there is no ""better"" path to follow and all choices you make are purely subjective. You don't have to become upset or even respond. I don't do well talking to emotional people. My response to your post was to sort of instigate a discussion on the philosophy that rules this subreddit which I think would be interesting. Perhaps you could have avoided any doubt if you had defined initially what ""better"" means in your context."
