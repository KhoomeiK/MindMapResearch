fatlogic,ffgtz2s,t3_etans3,1579915003.0,"Imagine being at a BMI of 34 and wishing you could have weight loss surgery. It's breathtaking. Girl, just lose the damn weight."
MUAontheCheap,ffdo1lg,t1_ffdhsax,1579824971.0,"Yeah, I'm eager to see some new color stories this year."
MUAontheCheap,ffdnz5v,t1_ffdir8l,1579824930.0,YES. I know everyone thinks those colors are boring but I'd rather have a boring palette than one full of bright colors that either don't look great on me or that I can't wear every day. I'd love to actually hit pan on something.
My600lbLife,ff7ek82,t3_erziee,1579647731.0,Already down 7 pounds dis munt! Watching this show helps inspire me for sure.
fatlogic,ff6maf2,t1_ff6j2xr,1579630230.0,"LOL, your description of these guys is sending me. At least you're able to appreciate it for how hilarious and sad it is."
fatlogic,ff6lpl2,t1_ff6ex92,1579629875.0,"That sounds exhausting. They must be insecure to be commenting on your eating habits so much. Just know you've accomplished something great and worth being proud of, we're proud of you too!"
fatlogic,ff3treg,t1_ff31oul,1579548670.0,Someone in this very subreddit told me the other day that sleep apnea isn't solved by weight loss so the fatlogic is coming from inside the building.
fatlogic,fendheh,t1_fen4yxi,1579282342.0,The trade off is that smaller amounts of weight lost look more dramatic on us shorties :)
fatlogic,fend6yi,t3_eq1ksj,1579282168.0,"I got really sick at like 3am the morning of my weekly weigh-in and while it's flattering to see such a low number on the scale, I know it's not accurate because of water lost. A petty thing to complain about, I know, but I look forward to this all week! lol"
fatlogic,fenctpg,t1_femycgx,1579281945.0,"If so, only by about an inch. And most likely due to increased immigration from countries whose people tend to be shorter like Mexico and Asian nations"
fatlogic,fencglp,t1_femyl6x,1579281722.0,"I agree, I don't think this is very far off either."
fatlogic,felde55,t1_felb8v8,1579219547.0,God I hate MFP.
fatlogic,felcxud,t1_fek8xb8,1579219243.0,Right? Like how does that even make sense?
fatlogic,fehc09b,t1_fefmm92,1579113444.0,The amount of people just looking for an ego stroke is kind of out of control.
fatlogic,fehbitm,t1_fefss0n,1579113156.0,Have heard good things about laser treatment and microneedling for stretch marks.
starbucks,fedw9nd,t3_eod0me,1579021225.0,SHE'S a thing! I'm sorry that happened to you. Please know that 99% of customers will never feel that way about you and think people like her are vile.
fatlogic,fe5gyg0,t3_en9qf8,1578869314.0,There were days when all I ate was a bowl of macaroni and cheese and a chocolate egg in one sitting and I still lost weight
fatlogic,fe4rzjn,t3_enqqdd,1578862255.0,"I really don't get this line of thought. If I had a serious health problem that had a good chance of being resolved by losing weight, I'd jump on it. Not everyone is so lucky."
fatlogic,fdwvfe5,t1_fdwnzr5,1578762717.0,"Also ""adulting"""
fatlogic,fdws0s7,t1_fdvei8v,1578761815.0,"Seconding this suggestion, also adding the Leslie Sansone walking videos. There are a million of them on her channel on YouTube and they're great, entry-level workouts that actually do something but even beginners can keep up. They helped me a lot starting out and like Fitness Marshall you don't need equipment."
fatlogic,fdqtzah,t1_fdqsgsg,1578674831.0,"Good point, I didn't know about the Hep C or its link to T2!"
fatlogic,fdqk4rm,t3_emg6ba,1578668615.0,"The argument that people can't afford to eat a low calorie diet / work out / have exercise clothing is so dumb. It's just straight up ignorant garbage, and even worse when someone tries to pass it off as some social statement on how much the US sucks. No, you suck. It costs literally nothing to eat less, work out at home/go running, and use ratty old clothes you already have."
fatlogic,fdqjpf2,t1_fdqja2w,1578668329.0,That makes sense! I never knew it was that high either but 85% overweight or obese should still be a huge wake up call for patients to start losing weight.
fatlogic,fdqiksc,t1_fdq7v8s,1578667554.0,"I read the other day that Tommy Lee has T2 diabetes, but he's the only person I've ever heard of to be at a normal weight and have T2. I'm sure they exist of course, but it does say something when one disease tends to be almost solely the domain of the overweight & obese."
starbucks,fdoesp0,t3_emcnn5,1578603766.0,I look forward to the day I finally encounter one of these chains so I can stop them.
AmItheAsshole,fdoed47,t1_fdnerhs,1578603558.0,"Everyone at the wedding is either going to know who you are, or assume you're related to the groom at worst. This request is bananas and you're NTA for not wanting to comply."
weddingshaming,fdo8rb0,t1_fdnwjxd,1578600848.0,"I wouldn't mind wearing it in general, but to a wedding? HELL NO!"
weddingshaming,fdnw0pf,t1_fdn6fni,1578593986.0,I think sometimes people just say shit to troll or be contrary. This is obviously inappropriate to wear to a wedding and you don't have to be jealous to see that. Anyone who really believes it's okay is the same kind of tacky idiot who'd wear it in the first place.
starbucks,fdnl1ue,t1_fdmip7d,1578588031.0,"Wow, he sure showed you!"
fatlogic,fdkog4v,t1_fdkgahr,1578507817.0,"Yep, it sucks to give myself smaller portions than my guy (who's a foot taller than I am) especially when the food looks really good, but sometimes it just be like that."
Makeup,fdbhd44,t1_fd7f3av,1578257432.0,"This reminds me of Sephulta employees who see any kind of redness in the face (especially if fair skinned) and start throwing pink cool-toned foundations at them. Like no, thanks, pink is kind of what I'm trying to cancel out but okay."
Makeup,fdbgyrz,t1_fd6molu,1578257283.0,"Born This Way runs SUPER orange. I went in to buy that and couldn't find any shade that even remotely looked good. Left with a ""neutral"" shade of Peach Perfect that ended up being kind of orange. Maybe Too Faced just runs orange?"
fatlogic,fcywem7,t1_fcwil5o,1578088553.0,Status: online / away / obese
fatlogic,fcyqh8y,t1_fcykvgg,1578084993.0,"You're right. It seems that they're referring to cardiac cachexia, which is a complication of existing heart failure and basically equates to a wasting syndrome. Healthy and intentional weight loss is recommended for overweight/obese heart failure patients and can even lead to a reversal in their condition."
TheSimpsons,fcwg6hm,t3_ej7mu0,1578024784.0,"Oh, I suppose I'd best to run. Lord have mercy, I wish I weren't so fat."
SchittsCreek,fcv47vf,t1_fcv11mi,1577994309.0,"I'll be a little heartbroken if they end up leaving town. I know the entire show has been about them desperate to get out, but they've grown so much throughout the seasons (and grown attached to the town residents!) that it would be bittersweet to see them go. I'd love a finale that ends on a high note but with no one leaving, where you could believe that the next day they all go on living their lives as usual in Schitt's Creek."
MUAontheCheap,fcthej0,t1_fcqlz8t,1577943356.0,"I've been hearing good things about their Luxe Pro Powder in Pearl Luminizer, so I just picked one up to try."
RhodeIsland,fctgdy0,t3_eieihb,1577942413.0,It's been replaced with a breakfast/burger/beer restaurant called Uptown ([uptownri.com](https://uptownri.com)).
MUAontheCheap,fcsr9ij,t1_fcrh4pz,1577923094.0,"I agree, but I wish they'd start offering free shipping. At the very least, diamond should have free shipping and platinum should have a lower threshold for it to kick in (maybe $20-25, as diamond currently is)."
MUAontheCheap,fcsqnzh,t1_fcr2c9a,1577922666.0,"This will probably be my last year at diamond. The modest point multiplier and $25 salon gift card (that I never use) is not worth spending $1,200 a year, especially when you can spend $200 less at Sephora and get free shipping to boot. Having to pay for shipping on orders below $25 as a diamond is a complete joke."
MUAontheCheap,fcsqico,t1_fcrj7vo,1577922550.0,"I agree. It may not be a popular opinion, but I think the price increase is reasonable considering how many perks you get as a platinum member and how good Ulta's reward system is in general. What is NOT reasonable is having to spend $1200 to hit diamond and you STILL have to pay for shipping on anything under $25. Sephora Rouge is $200 less and you always get free shipping. I'd love to see Ulta lower the shipping threshold for both platinum and diamond."
fatlogic,fcrinkv,t1_fcp131d,1577902319.0,"The last time she did any kind of exercise was the 90s so for her, it's about guilt."
fatlogic,fcopckl,t1_fcniv1i,1577838018.0,"Omg my mother does this. Every time we eat a dessert or something rich, she always says we'll have to take a walk around the block afterwards. It drives me nuts. I've already accounted for this and worked out for the day!"
YouOnLifetime,fcleeyo,t3_ehhflh,1577745881.0,"""Beck was real! She humps a pillow multiple times!"""
YouOnLifetime,fcl0phr,t1_fckpnmp,1577737280.0,"She was an awful person, no doubt about it. The most I can see is defending her right to live because although an obsessive narcissist, she didn't deserve to die for it. But none of her behaviour is really defensible."
YouOnLifetime,fckjjw9,t1_fcjd4ad,1577726722.0,"Dark's casting is out of this world, especially considering the smaller pool of actors they have to work with. It's unreal. And really puts into perspective how bad casting in other shows (like this) can be."
YouOnLifetime,fckj7in,t3_ehnz1s,1577726513.0,"Looks delicious, but bitter on the inside."
YouOnLifetime,fckiqcw,t1_fci7irf,1577726215.0,"I think you're right. He is still sending money to Ellie, but who knows how long that will last. He even lost touch with Will as evidenced by the postcard in the last episode. Not that Will was a major character in his life, but it's just more proof that he doesn't seem good at holding onto anyone."
YouOnLifetime,fckig1y,t3_eha6cx,1577726039.0,"I was hoping that we'd see a reunion with Paco since they both ended up in the same state, but California's a big place and tbh we had too many characters to keep track of this season as it is. Maybe he'll show up in season 3.

I am also really disappointed that we haven't heard anything about the investigation into Peach's death, because the end of S1 seemed to really be setting that up. I was also kind of bummed that Dr. Nicky seemed resigned to his fate and didn't care to try to fight his wrongful imprisonment. It just seems too easy for Joe this way."
YouOnLifetime,fckicp8,t1_fck39ch,1577725983.0,Candace is annoying but they got me to feel for her by the end. It was upsetting that she never got to bring Joe to justice.
YouOnLifetime,fcki4pj,t3_ehiwda,1577725842.0,"Forty was bad at first and continued to have cringeworthy moments throughout the series, but he had likeable qualities. Ellie had that annoying ""pretentious kid"" vibe but you felt for her because she was after all just a kid and one who had been through (and was currently going through) a lot of difficult stuff. But the most annoying character for me was Love. Just a clingy, weird, overly spontaneous drama queen. I didn't hate her but she did get on my nerves."
YouOnLifetime,fckhv0j,t1_fcj6ly0,1577725673.0,"I'm very surprised we didn't get this revelation because I had a hinky feeling something was up with James's death from the moment Love mentioned it. We got so many clues about their troubled relationship, how doctors couldn't figure out his mysterious illness, and once we found out that Love's a killer I really thought it was setting up for a poison reveal. She is a chef who works with exotic ingredients, after all."
YouOnLifetime,fckhaz8,t3_eho7st,1577725322.0,"I thought Beck was a bit boring and found myself frequently irritated with her decisions, but she was a very human character and definitely didn't deserve her fate. I think the hatred for her is similar to the hatred people had for Skyler in Breaking Bad. Her character had flaws too, but in the end, people just seemed mad that she got in the way of their beloved protagonist. It says a lot more about them than it does about the characters."
YouOnLifetime,fckgfi6,t1_fck9jh9,1577724762.0,"I liked her because I found her entertaining to watch. Yes, she was spoilt and obnoxious and I'd never want to be her friend in reality, but it was kind of fun and interesting to watch her and learn more about her. Sometimes you just love to hate a character."
MUAontheCheap,fcihsb4,t1_fcifel7,1577662765.0,I thought the same. People are really sleeping on those pads! They were part of the 21 Days of Beauty last spring so maybe they'll return again this year.
MUAontheCheap,fciho71,t3_eh0lhl,1577662712.0,I wonder if they're discontinuing UD De-slick. It was just 50% off very recently and now they're coming out with a brand new All Nighter Matte spray?
starbucks,fc7lbe5,t1_fc7aksy,1577511139.0,"I don't understand why this is even allowed :( You should be able to ask customers to go inside for this. Yeah, you run the risk of upsetting them but the alternative is upsetting literally every customer inconvenienced by them. And I'd rather keep their business than the business of one shitty customer who thinks it's okay to order 30 gift cards in the fucking drive thru."
starbucks,fc6em7d,t1_fc5tqw0,1577478748.0,"The drive-thru Starbucks closest to me almost always has a 10+ car line that wraps around a stop sign (inside a parking lot) and blocks traffic in at least one direction. You can't see around these people when you're trying to make a turn around them at the stop sign they're blocking and it's a fucking safety hazard, but they don't care. The best part is that the inside is rarely busy."
starbucks,fc4gwzb,t1_fc47kje,1577416323.0,All of the stores in my area were closed as well.
