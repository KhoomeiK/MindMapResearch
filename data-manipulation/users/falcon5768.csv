She's exceptionally talented in an implausibly wide variety of areas - Nope not there too, she shows some talents and shows herself to be surprising, BUT its only because shes 600 fucking years old... we even know from her backstory and the crews first meeting with her she was not always the sage they knew and that much of her ability to perceive time in a different way comes from being trapped in the Nexus and then ripped from it when Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty rescued her and the others of her kind. Also her skills are not only rare but pretty common in the Star Trek universe, listening, fencing, and shooting phasers pretty good.... hardly this rare or nonexistent thing.

She also lacks any realistic, or at least story-relevant, character flaws  - again shown multiple times to not be the case. She has family issues especially with her dad who she outright hid from on Earth. She has issues relating to her kids, shes quick to anger. She also was never shown to be able to challenge Q as much as Q had a distrust of her in part for her ability to perceive time, and likely because he was fucking with Jean Luc since the episode this issue came up in was the one where the Enterprise first contacts the Borg, Q Who."

On TNG he tested humanity, on VOY the test was over, humanity proved itself not just worthy of existence but worthy of being on par with the Q and being involved with their affairs... regardless of the fact humanity wanted nothing to do with the Q."

>He said the amount of time which the crew maintained consciousness “depends on the rate at which the crew module lost pressure, and that depends on the size of the hole in the crew module,” which could not be ascertained from the wreckage.

We know for a fact they were absolutely conscious for up to 10 seconds after the explosion due to tapes. We have a guestimate of at the worse case scenario, they had another 10-15 seconds after they turned on the air. Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin when asked about the report was honest when he said there was a good chance they were alive and conscious upon impact.

More telling though is how much air was used.

> inspection of two of the air packs, including the one belonging to Smith, showed they were three-quarters to seven-eighths empty at the time of impact. 

The packs could only have been that empty if someone was actually breathing it. The air is drawn on demand and doesn't just flow from these pacts. In fact NASA is pretty frank in saying they have no clue how so much air was used since they could not have survived that long since it was about 5 minutes of air under normal breathing, and the whole thing lasted 71 seconds."

Unfortunately way too many things say otherwise, the biggest being the emergency air valves were manually opened, and not enough g forces were exerted on the cabin to have knocked them out either in the explosion, or the ballistic fall to the ground. 

Thankfully it only lasted a little over a minute, and the impact was over 200gs so they were instantaneously crushed so fast that their nerves would never have registered the pain, but they were very much alive the whole time, and likely although not certainly conscious."
todayilearned,ff8v0e0,t1_ff8tefz,1579697024.0,"as mentioned by /u/derekakessler the Karman line is THE defacto line for the start of space for all international treaties. The Columbia didnt break up until nearly 40 km under than line. NASA doesn't even consider 100km to be space either, they have long held 122 km which is the point at which space vehicle experience significant atmospheric drag to be the point at which space starts which means the Columbia was nearly half way through the atmosphere already when it broke up. Lastly the US doesn't even reward people astronaut wings under 80m, again well above when the Columbia broke up.

So they were nowhere near still in space, they were actually midway through the atmosphere. Just because jets don't usually fly above 30-40,000 feet, doesn't mean that space starts right above it."
todayilearned,ff8o2zy,t1_ff8i9sx,1579688321.0,"Same thing happened with Challenger. Little known fact, from all indications most if not all of the crew survived the breakup of the orbiter when the Challenger exploded, and the command crew were fighting their hardest to bring the orbiter down, completely unaware there was nothing left, that the only thing that had survived was basically the crew portion of the orbiter, everything behind the bay bulkhead was gone.

This went suppressed for years because NASA and the government didn't want the public to know that despite the explosion and the g forces involved, the crew didn't die until they hit the water, being fully conscious for the most part on the way down. There were multiple switches and valves including the emergency oxygen valves, and numerous switches on the panels that clearly indicate they tried to regain control and land the orbiter.

The Space programs are full of stories like these showing just how impressive the people involved are. Apollo 12 nearly ended in disaster when they lost all power to the capsule at liftoff due to a lightning strike, only for someone on the ground to remember a super obscure switch within the capsule that ended up resetting power. Then there is Skylab, where because of damage when it left the Saturn V that took it up, was without power, and had a damaged heat shield that made being within it impossible. Astronauts still went up there and jury rigged a system to fix it and ended up living in what was basically a tin can with a camping blanket strapped to it. Then there was Mir which holy shit the amount of times the Cosmonauts and Astronauts in the end rushed to fix it due to a space ship crash, fires, and power loss.

Its honestly amazing humans have only ""technically"" lost 3 people in space. Pretty much everyone else lost has been on their way up, way down already within the atmosphere, or on training missions. The only three actually lost in space were the crew of Soyuz 11 who decompressed due to a faulty valve while preparing for re-entry."

Others are people forget you have to immediately redeem cards you gain after knocking a player out if it gives you 4 or more card, people chose to pick their territories one at a time (the real rules going back to even the original 1959 game says you deal the cards out, people don't get to pick though over time this has gone back and forth) removal of the bonus army (used to be a cap of +2 after 1980 but was completely removed after 2003) you are allowed to move your army from one territory to another through a continuous path if available (used to be you could ONLY move your army from one owned spot to the next if it was adjacent, that was changed to you could go from Australia to freaking England as long as you owned a path to those places)

Now the reality is the rules have changed over time. The rules I grew up with (bonus armies and pick your territories) were removed from the game in part to speed it up, but then there are rules like the 2 player version that have always existed but people just dont realize that the less players you have, the more the armies change.

It even gets weirder if you play vs people who grew up in other countries too, as like Monopoly there are different rules in Europe and Asia."

Its only the anti-Apple redditors who think there was this massive alterior motive here. The reality was, lightning was developed and released 2 years before USB C was ratified. So there was no reversible connector available at that time, and one of the biggest demands consumers of the iPhone had WAS to have a reversible connector. 

But Apple was deeply involved in USB Cs creation, as was a whole consortium of consumer companies. The only real reason Apple didnt switch right away is simple economics, they had developed this connector, had a lot of stuff tied to it, and did not want to piss off consumers who invested into it. People forget the absolutely bitching that was had at the idea of getting rid of the Firewire on the iPod, and even more so getting rid of the 30pin.

todayilearned,fekux8b,t1_fektq62,1579208110.0," journalist Seymour Hersh, citing American witnesses, alleged that a platoon of U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicles from the 1st Brigade, 24th Infantry Division opened fire on a large group of more than 350 disarmed Iraqi soldiers who had surrendered at a makeshift military checkpoint after fleeing the devastation on Highway 8 on February 27, apparently hitting some or all of them. 


Television crews travelling with the Allied forces in Kuwait came upon the aftermath by chance. As the first pictures appeared on American television, the White House justified the attack by referring to the dead as 'torturers, looters and rapists'. However, it was obvious that the convoy included not only limited lorries, but civilian vehicles: battered Toyota vans, Volkswagens, motorbikes. Their occupants were foreign workers who had been trapped in Kuwait: Palestinians, Bangladeshis, Sudanese, Egyptians and others. In a memorable report for BBC radio, Stephen Sackur who distinguished himself against the odds in the Gulf, described the carnage in such a way that he separated for his listeners, ordinary Iraqis from Saddam Hussein. He converted [them] to human beings. The incinerated figures, he said, were simply people trying to get home; he sounded angry. Kate Adie was there for the BBC. Her television report showed corpses in the desert and consumer goods scattered among the blackened vehicles. If this was 'loot', it was pathetic: toys, dolls, hair-dryers. She interviewed a U.S. Marine Lieutenant, who appeared distressed. He said the convoy had ""no air cover, nothing"", and he added ambiguously: ""it was not very professional at all."" Adie did not ask what he meant, nor did she attempt to explain why the massacre had taken place. But she did say that those who fought and died for Iraq here turned out to be from the north of the country, from minority communities, persecuted by Saddam Hussein – the Kurds and the Turks.

Colin Powell, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the future Secretary of State, said the ""shooting gallery"" scene's carnage was the reason to end the Persian Gulf War hostilities after the Liberation of Kuwait campaign. Powell wrote later in his autobiography ""My American Journey"" that ""the television coverage was starting to make it look as if we were engaged in slaughter for slaughter's sake.""


I flew from my home in Paris to Riyadh when the ground war began and arrived at the ""mile of death"" very early in the morning on the day the war stopped. Few other journalists were there when I arrived at this incredible scene, with carnage that was strewn all over. On this mile stretch were cars and trucks with wheels still turning and radios still playing. Bodies were scattered along the road. Many have asked how many people died during the war with Iraq, and the question has never been well answered. That first morning, I saw and photographed a U.S. military ""graves detail"" burying many bodies in large graves. I don't recall seeing many television images of these human consequences. Nor do I remember many photographs of these casualties being published. 

Sorry bub. It was a war crime pure and simple and many of those troops were civilians."

todayilearned,fek44bz,t1_fejwtgx,1579192199.0,"I never saw this issue as inherently wrong. 

The one incident I DO find wrong was when we blew the shit out of the Iraq military who were fleeing back to Baghdad. That one was undoubtedly a war crime because they were not fighting the coalition at that point but fleeing for their lives.  Its not surprised it was the Highway of Death incident that actually started fracturing the coalition, and caused Bush to call the whole thing off. 

What made it worse was the pure misinformation that fed the whole thing. A lot of why the US was ok with it at first was the image that all of these people were on par with the Japanese military in China, raping women throwing babies out of incubators and stomping on them etc. General Norman Schwarzkopf even used that as the excuse to attack the highway.

The reality was it was all bullshit, The House of Al Sabah had made up all the reports, the most famous being the baby one, who the woman who testified as a nurse was, in fact, the daughter to Kuwait's leadership and had never been in Kuwait in years and was certainly not a nurse. Its estimated a large portion of the people killed on the highway of death were actually civilian workers and ex-pats escaping back to their countries after Iraq fled and were caught in the traffic jam that followed.

Edit: yep not a surprise lets vote down the guy who points out the war crimes the US committed in the Gulf War."

a LARGE portion of the US Democratic party is not progressive like the rest of the world is, but would be akin to a Torie in the UK. People like Biden or Clinton are centrists, not progressives. They may be for progressive social issues (even thats questionable) but their economic policies are only slightly LESS right than the Republican parties. Hell people completely forget Hilary was a Republican and was part of Barry Goldwaters team! She even admitted to being a Goldwater girl until college and getting swept up in the anti-war movement. 

Even Warren is still somewhat right of what everywhere else in the world considers an actual progressive. In the public eye in the Democratic party really only AOC and Bernie are actual progressives, and that scares a lot of large businesses who see it as a movement with the millenials who have dealt with the Reagan years on and always being shit on and who now outnumber the Boomers of which people like Biden and Warren are.

This is in part why single payer failed under Obama and they went with the ACA... far too many Red Dems who would have jump ship to the Republicans if their bottom line was in any way threatened."

legaladvice,fee5gux,t1_fedl4cy,1579026794.0,">If being drunk is an excuse for everything then fuck I guess I'll get drunk before I commit a crime.

From OP

>friend was interning 
>Her boss
>she's an international student

From a legal standpoint, I am not sure this meets the sniff test as not rape.

>Affirmative consent: Did the person express overt actions or words indicating agreement for sexual acts?
>Freely given consent: Was the consent offered of the person’s own free will, without being induced by fraud, coercion, violence, or threat of violence?
>Capacity to consent: Did the individual have the capacity, or legal ability, to consent?

Based on the evidence she already did not agree to sex and politely turned him down by saying she was married, and if consent was eventually given it was given while intoxicated, which failed point 3.

So under most states laws, this is rape under two definitions, it was not freely given consent and she was not in the position TO give consent by being drunk.

I know this is not the thing a lot of ""men"" like to hear here, but just because you used to have drunk sex back in the 80's/90's doesn't meant that shit flies now, and you should not think that the OPs friend being drunk as well gives you an out. You cant sign a contract drunk, so what makes you think you can reasonably consent to a violation of your body while drunk especially when you previously pointed out you are married.

Also while I do not know who the OP is based on the idea shes young, and married, but also a international student, it is highly likely shes Indian and in a arranged marriage, which means if the parents were to find out she could be at serious personal risk."
