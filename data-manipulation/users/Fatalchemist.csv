PoliticalHumor,fgulvgk,t1_fgujpyy,1581124049.0,I'm still just imagining an army of people who share the first name Christian.
vegan,fguhxkm,t1_fgugil7,1581121239.0,"Here's the thing.

People on here: I'm venting!

You: How about we don't vent and instead we never get to feel human emotions and only feel love and happiness only! Nothing more!

Then you're being an antagonistic force to people who already get antagonized every day.

Look at other subs. Even /r/StardewValley is known for being so wholesome. But people still vent about issues. Before, the dog would sometimes block your way and you couldn't get to sleep. People talk about how frustrating it is. You want to get your goals completed but RNG didn't let that happen quickly so you post about how that sucked. People complain about the shop keeper, Pierre closing on Wednesday. It's wholesome, but it's human nature to vent because people in that subreddit share the struggles and can relate.

It's like that everywhere. You have frustrations but when you find a group of like-minded people, you now have people who understand and a community that can actually reply with their own stories to make you feel like you're not alone. It's not just, ""Oh that sucks, man. Sorry."" but something more personal.

So of course when you tell people to stop doing the thing they're doing in the only place they can do that thing, then of course it will annoy people. Here is where we can finally say all the shit we can't say to people in real life for various reasons."

I've got big balls  
And they're such big balls  
Dirty big balls  
And he's got big balls,  
And she's got big balls,  
But we've got the biggest balls of them all!  

Some balls are held for charity  
And some for fancy dress  
But when they're held for pleasure,  
They're the balls that I like best.  
And my balls are always bouncing,  
To the left and to the right.  
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night."
vegan,fguf7jd,t1_fgudze9,1581119325.0,"Or maybe, just maybe, I'm tired of always being nice in real life.

Am I eating a salad in the break room? I have to deal with people constantly battling my eating habits. Am I going out with friends and not eat meat? I guess they'll want to keep telling me how wrong I am. Family invites me to a BBQ place and constantly make that same, ""bacon is vegan lol"" joke over and over as if it was even funny the first time? I have to just ""not be a dick"" about it and ""chill out"" or whatever.

But here? Here is people that actually share my views. And they get shit on the same way. This is where we can vent. We can talk about how annoying it is dealing with people that give us shit.

This post? It's not shitting on people who eat meat. It's shitting on people who argue with us over it and say they're eating how their ancestors ate. It's being able to vent in a place where people can understand your annoyances.

Me being a dick here is how I'm sane enough to not be a dick to everyone in real life because I'm tired of people constantly belittling and berating me every day."
vegan,fguem5a,t1_fgucfmr,1581118918.0,"Seriously. It's like going to the subreddit for a game or a hobby and saying that isn't a substitute for a personality to a random post.

What does this person think subreddits or message boards with topics are supposed to be?"
