MothershipOasis,fell7cs,t3_epg68p,1579224831.0,I can’t wait for this game!
offmychest,fefrhff,t3_eokc27,1579063065.0,Big e-hug from me too. I'm so sorry this happened to you and it doesn't sound fair. I hope the best for you out of a difficult situation.
offmychest,fefrbs6,t3_eow7zk,1579062945.0,"Dude, in 2020 approaching people is TOUGH. If you think that this is only happening to you, it is not. It is happening to a lot of people because we don't know how to interact anymore."
offmychest,fefr20x,t3_eowznm,1579062734.0,"Don't worry about the lazy coworkers you have, because in the future you'll be putting them in the ""No Interview"" pile."
offmychest,fefqtwn,t3_eox7s8,1579062562.0,"I once dated a girl for a month that I had liked for 9 years and she broke up with me. I felt some serious pain for probably six months so I feel you totally. It gets better with time, that's all it is. You don't need to throw yourself out there, you didn't do anything wrong, it just happens. 

You can't expedite the process, it just takes time but you will push through. I'm sorry you have to suffer it :("
offmychest,fefprhu,t1_fefp751,1579061761.0,Came home with a Ph.D like a true winner! Be proud of that! I have no idea who you are but I'm proud of you!
offmychest,fefpkoz,t3_eoo5sz,1579061622.0,I've been the asshole boss that talked this amazing young woman up to apply for a promotion because I thought she would be perfect for it. Later my boss told me I had to promote this other person because they had more time with the company despite what I wanted to do. I still think about this all the time and wish I had stood up to my boss for her because she deserved it. It is one of my biggest regrets in life and a mistake that I'll never make again.
offmychest,fefoqxn,t1_fefocmu,1579061050.0,"God I feel that so much. When I left I had this HUGE party and said goodbye to everyone. When I came home I started working a job that was MUCH less significant than the one that I had moved for. For a while I felt like the smallest person in the world. 

Eventually you get over it and you learn that it doesn't matter. Since then I've moved into a great job and have moved up into a great position. I don't like my job, but it doesn't leave me feeling like the small person I felt like when I moved back home.

Bottom line: move back home. You will feel so much better."
offmychest,fefoeum,t1_feflz82,1579060812.0,"Can confirm, this sounds like a 20 year old me. A lot of your friends are not going to be helpful as you grow older. I have about 4 great friends that I can rely on now if I ever needed them. Hating work is natural especially when you have to do some pretty rough work for just a little bit of money.

If it makes you feel better, I'm 31 and don't like my job. I make a lot of money but I'm considering starting over and becoming a car mechanic or a lawyer. Two polar opposite jobs, but I think I'd love them both. The mechanic work honestly sounds way better to me though."
offmychest,fefnsz3,t3_eowfoo,1579060399.0,"I totally understand you and when I was in your position I ended up moving back home. I don't have a remedy for your problem, but that's how I fixed it."
offmychest,fefnf3m,t3_eol0cn,1579060136.0,I'm proud of you! 50 days 100% sober is amazing!
offmychest,fefn2t8,t3_eot63w,1579059907.0,"Talking to her isn't going to help my friend. It's going to take time, sometimes a lot of time. At the end of your pain is either a better life or you become more robust. 

It sucks, but you have to let it be and don't bother her."
offmychest,fefmmlu,t3_eown54,1579059611.0,Congratulations!!!!
offmychest,fefmiqn,t3_eof3bt,1579059539.0,"Stop the Bleed training is about saving lives, the tough things are the important things. Push through for the kids, even if it is tough."
offmychest,fefm6go,t3_eoqx3o,1579059315.0,I'm so happy for you!
offmychest,fdbv7v0,t3_eki8ru,1578262474.0,Congratulations!!!! That’s awesome!!!
offmychest,fd7ge45,t3_ek6u5r,1578204077.0,I’m in the US. Is there anything I can do to help you? Or is there a specific organization that you’d like me to donate to?
MadeMeSmile,fczzmyf,t3_eim88r,1578111386.0,What a nice thing to do :) I bet it made their day
StardewValley,fcwjhn3,t1_fcwitsg,1578027302.0,I think that was an overkill.
StardewValley,fcw4cp9,t3_ej8c27,1578016856.0,My girlfriend said this bridge reminder her of the night market.
ElderScrollsBlades,fcsej3u,t3_eijvoh,1577915410.0,I got my first one at 21 which had an exotic iron sword in it :(
offmychest,fcp5ln9,t1_fcp5j3f,1577851211.0,Happy New Year! I love you and I hope the best for you!

offmychest,fcp4oay,t1_fcp4ixy,1577850359.0,"I understand this. I come from a family that isn’t “normal.” Just know that me and a lot of other people here think the world of you, and we love you :)"
ElderScrollsBlades,fcmymzm,t3_ehr07n,1577797819.0,I’m angry just thinking I may have to fight against that one day.
ElderScrollsBlades,fcmyfgn,t1_fcmxrfm,1577797602.0,Nice.
offmychest,fcj70ar,t1_fcj6kuw,1577678842.0,"Not mine. Tell me about yourself, do you have hobbies? Games you play?"
