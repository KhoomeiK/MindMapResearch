AskReddit,fffwwsp,t3_etexdh,1579893589.0,"As far as public settings, I'm not so concerned. I think concerns of privacy have more to do in personal information. I think  lot of people are more worried about personal information being used to discriminate perhaps, or say, advertisers using personal info to target and manipulate you.

Also for example, consider why it's really shitty to dox someone. Releasing personal information to the public that can put the victims at risk for harassment, or worse.

I hope this makes sense. I'm trying to boil down a complex subject in a couple of paragraphs."

Kind of an interesting premise. Tried to give it a chance. And I really liked the story of the mother desperately trying to figure out what happened to her son. I only got a few episodes in before I got bored of watching all the other characters discover the same information, some of which the audience can already guess or is explicitly told before any of the characters."
