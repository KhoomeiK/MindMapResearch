She would actually incite debates in class and ask provoking questions in order to get us to understand the context. For example, on the bombing of Hiroshima, she said that US was right to do that. Everyone immediately started saying how it was a crime against humanity, how the japanese were not at fault, etc. Then she explained how the japanese had their own dark history, and while the bombing was too extreme, the US was within their rights to retaliate.
