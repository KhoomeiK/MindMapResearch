Now that you have taken their ability to openly express how awful they are, they will blend in with everyone else.

You think we defend freedom of expression because we agree with individual sentiments but it can be quite valuable to allow people to show you their true colors."

rickandmorty,fesprtf,t1_fesoipn,1579367734.0,I chose medicine because it is recession proof. I will always have stable work no matter where I go. Sometimes we have to choose what makes financial sense rather than chase our dreams. Luckily for me I ended up loving my job and am very happy.
rickandmorty,feshhxc,t1_feshaga,1579365193.0,Agreed but maybe someone who is about to make that choice will read it and make a better choice. You never know.
rickandmorty,fesh9sc,t1_feseo3k,1579365091.0,I've never had that problem so it's hard to empathize. The only advice I think I can give is practice being alone. Not only that but find a way to discover happiness in solitude. This doesn't mean become a hermit but being happy with being by yourself can be a huge boost to confidence and self esteem.
