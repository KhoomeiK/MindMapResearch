mechanical_gifs,fepnja8,t3_eqb4bw,1579325284.0,I had a Honda where the window became disconnected from the attachment and you would have to catch the window before it fell into the door. Apparently they glued it in a shitty way. I had it replaced and had the same problem a day later (replaced again) and then a couple months later.

But that was after the American Revolution (where the common law basis of American law diverged), and there has been no law or court case in the US disputing its legality.

Why do I know this? I’m just trying to be prepared."

environment,fe098jc,t3_enhj8s,1578806618.0,"The link in the article was broken, so I couldn’t check their numbers. One of the problems in calculating the CO2 emissions of something like paper is that the source is mostly renewable, with managed forests, and any energy input depends on the carbon output of your energy source. So are they counting the wood chips that a paper plant burns for energy (probably, given over 1000 lbs of CO2 per tree). Does that take into account the CO2 removed by the forests?"

KerbalSpaceProgram,fdtndj7,t1_fdqt67t,1578719279.0,That transfer window map is neat. I’ve always used the 90° thumb rule and tweaked around the dates. That map would make it a lot easier (and also explains why I suck so much for Duna missions).

todayilearned,fdoff7c,t1_fdo4cnv,1578604068.0,"It is curious that gold was valued independently by many civilizations that were never in contact with each other, or never traded with each other.

Gold is valuable for the same reason a Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card is valuable. It is scarce and novel. It is also counterfeit resistant to a certain degree. It makes a natural currency. In addition, it has the historical inertia where people *know* that gold has value. If you want to devalue gold, you would also have to destroy every piece of literature and oral history that tells people of its great value and how people have lusted for it for millennia."
