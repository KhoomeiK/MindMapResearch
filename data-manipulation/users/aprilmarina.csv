science,ffj35rn,t3_etph4c,1579989209.0,"Well, I was put on a weight loss plan by my doctor. My T2 diabetes was out of control because of depression and I didn’t give a fuck if I lived or not.  In the meantime I really did the work in therapy, got on meds that made me less suicidal.  By the time my doctor called me in over an AIC of 9.4, I was ready to make changes and feel better. 

Right now I eat low calorie, lowish carb diet. Absolutely no refined sugar, and no fruit yet.  Lots of veggies and lean protein.  They do want you in ketosis, but not a keto diet.  Pretty low fat, in fact.  I feel amazing.  I can walk without pain. I like socializing, I was really a hermit before.  I have energy and re found my love of riding bikes.  I laugh more.  I am 63 and no longer want to die.  

But none of this would have happened without my finally leaning into therapy and recovering from depression, where cake and candy were my bestest friends.  I ate a horrifying amount of sugar.

Anyway, the most controversial case he had was a wheelchair bound man who was caught at airport security with a hand in his carry on.  A human hand. He was arrested and the victim’s body parts started turning up around town, and one he mailed to someone. Turns out the victim was his roommate., and the guy was arrested for murder. His story: he came home to find roommate murdered. So he decided to flush out the murderer by chopping up roomie with a skilsaw. Put one part in someone’s door, mailed another part. The hand went in the suitcase so he could personally deliver it.  I don’t remember details.  

My dad took it all the way to trial, he hated plea deals. And he lost, jury didn’t buy the story.  No one did, sorry dad. Not sure if the guy is still in prison or not!"
