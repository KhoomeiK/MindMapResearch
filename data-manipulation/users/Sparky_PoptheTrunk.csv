Google are the ADA and the FHA the same?  You'll get all the info you need.  The ADA does not cover ESA's."

The ADA allows public access of service animals.  ESA's are not covered under the ADA.  Google it.  

The FHA covers private homes, an area the ADA does not cover. they are seperate things. ESA's have zero protections outside of homes and planes.  

Stop providing false information."
news,ffcd5ff,t1_ffcajen,1579796891.0,You are wrong.  The fair housing act provides the rules and regulations for ESA's.  Not the ADA.  They are not the same and the ADA has nothing to with ESA's.
news,ffccm8x,t1_ffajirt,1579796559.0,Good.  As someone that wants to fly places I want it as hard as possible to get a dog on a plane.  I don't want them there.  I know a couple people that say there dog is an ESA so they.can travel with them.  They are assholes and I no longer have an interest in being friends with them.

I'm cool with Herm.  He's doing a lot i love in recruiting and being the face of the program.  I think he's underachieved record wise though.  I love the coaching changes he's made.  Shows me he knows what's wrong with the program instead of it festering like coaches before him."
CFB,ff9nj75,t1_ff9lxba,1579716714.0,"Chip got fired from Notre Dame a couple weeks ago.  Chip left because he didn't get promoted, he was never offered the ASU job.  

Pretty much everyone that left Grahams staff for Norvell got a promotion.  Coaches that left, like Simon,  were going to be pigeon holed as recruiters and position coaches with no way up at ASU.  Memphis gave them an opportunity to move up in a way.  

Also a lot of those coaches that left were from that part of the country.  That too was a Graham mistake."
CFB,ff9gc53,t1_ff9el5w,1579712415.0,"I still credit Graham with the first few seasons.  Did more with Ericksons recruits than Erickson and brought in key pieces on the defense.

What doomed Graham when everyone left was Chip long leaving.  He should have been promoted to OC.  That recruiting class had a disaster finish. Zero recruits committed in January.  If Chip Long is promoted that doesn't happen.  We probably get Byron Murphy. 

Josh Dobbs royally fucking us put us in a bad spot too."

CFB,ff954se,t1_ff91ek7,1579705072.0,"Not recruiting California was idiotic.  That, the OC Turnover and him micromanaging the defense were the reasons for our decline IMO.  

I don't believe Bo was married when he was hooking up with a coed.  Norvell was married when he was hooking up with a coed."
billsimmons,ff94rmf,t1_ff8zqiz,1579704822.0,"LOL.  4.7 million dog bites is very rare?  Having to get medical care for 800000 of those dog bites very rare?.  We have different definitions of rare then.

billsimmons,ff94eh5,t1_ff8zgdt,1579704574.0,"Anxiety occurs in some shape or form every day in i'd guess most people.  Most people just deal with it and don't need to drag a dog around.  If its so debilitating you can't function without a dog, you need more help than just a dog.   


Pets and ESA's should be banned from airlines.   When I flew earlier this year all the dogs I saw were not with veterans."
billsimmons,ff88ok0,t1_ff861wg,1579669238.0,"If you registered your dog as an ESA or Service dog you got scammed.  There is no registry for either.  

You are also an asshole for registering your dog as either.  You are part of the problem."
billsimmons,ff87n4j,t1_ff863cj,1579668326.0,Not what I did lol.  Dragging a dog around is not a reasonable way to get over anxiety IMO.

CFB,ff85drk,t3_es6jh9,1579666452.0,"Wow, good for him.  Might be an interesting cultural fit.  I liked him as ASU's coach overall.  He should have been fired a year earlier than he was.  

He was great at hiring offensive coordinators.  Thats probably his best skill.  Kind of an asshole at times.  It'll be interesting to see what scheme he goes with. Regardless, he needs to be a program manager and not involved in play calling."

I just take issues when people force them on other people or they are a sanitation issue.  They shouldn't be on planes, in restaurants, retail store, gyms, grocery stores.  

I don't think my stance is that unreasonable.  It was this way till about ten years ago."
