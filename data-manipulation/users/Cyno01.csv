When the book was written, ""Chilean sea bass"" was a fancy new name for an ugly (but tasty) fish, but theres like 20 diff fish known as ""sea bass"", some of them more related than others. Toothfish wasnt really a specific substitute for one, just a rebranding of something that wasnt previously even marketed. Restaurants loved the stuff because it was still relatively inexpensive and easy to cook. It sounded super fancy so it was the *appearance* of high class, something that would impress the rubes, you get a couple of frozen chilean sea bass filets in with your Omaha steak order, suburban fancy. Whenever Hammond said ""spared no expense"" in the book it was sorta ironically...

But by the time the movie rolled around, ""chilean sea bass"" was the *good* sea bass because 10 of those 20 diff fish known as ""sea bass"" were almost extinct, and actually was the most expensive fish on the market.  So when Hammond said ""spared no expense"" in regards to the meal, he was being serious. In the movie the only expense spared was IT, in the book it was EVERYTHING.

Its a seriously tasty fish though, next to impossible to even find the real thing nowadays at any price, forgery is rampant in the seafood industry and i think its endangered now, but i had some 20 years ago on someone elses tab and it was good enough i still remember it."

Haven did pretty good with that formula for a couple of seasons too. Hell, that was pretty much the formula for the USA Network for a decade, Burn Notice, White Collar etc, and it works!
