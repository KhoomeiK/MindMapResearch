aww,ffzfggc,t1_ffxybfs,1580376397.0,"I had never had a dog or really been around them before so I didn't know this, and I fed my first dog grapes. :( She loved them so much and I would roll them across the room and she would freak out chasing them down. It was so fun until she puked on the floor and had terrible shits for days. Poor thing."
japanlife,ffxzbg7,t1_ffwm37k,1580335399.0,Fair. I mean that the people coming into my school seem to be a bit pearl clutching. (It's only happened twice in the last however many years I've been there) But I was just using that experience to explain that the school will probably take it really seriously.
japanlife,ffwfufc,t3_evl1h9,1580299470.0,"If you really can't handle some kids being little shits, just go to the school and narc on them. I work at a fancy private school and every once in a while some pearl clutching citizen comes and reports that our students were being loud in a train or combini or whatever. Then the kids get a stern talking to during chapel. And balance is restored..."

TwoXChromosomes,ffgqvmv,t3_ete3o4,1579912756.0,"I'm so happy for you!!! And so angry that the medical professionals were so dismissive. It's so hard to seek help for such a sensitive issue--and then have all your fears come to fruition when they don't listen to your concerns.

 I also was a virgin when I got married, and the first month was so painful and frustrating and upsetting because I wanted to have sex SO BAD but we physically couldn't make it work. Thankfully, I was able to stretch my hymen without surgery, but it was such a painful, humiliating time. Thanks for raising awareness to this--it's more common that people realize because so many people suffer in silence."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffgq5xi,t1_fffa9cy,1579912237.0,This is really well explained!
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffgq2wz,t1_fff7kuo,1579912177.0,"Other commenters have explained it to you as well, and you seem receptive, so I'm I feel like you are well-meaning, but maybe didn't think through the consequences of your suggestion. Also, I'm generalizing the genders for this comment--not that women can't be predators and men victims, but that's what the original post was about.

Your comment suggests women should police their clothing instead of men policing their actions. I called you a fuck face because a) it's a funny insult and b) I cannot emphasise enough how dangerous and harmful that mindset is.

For starters, it doesn't work. Are you seriously saying I should not wear a parka if I want to avoid being cat called because they are ""sexy?"" Are you hearing yourself?? I've lived in countries where women wear abayas, covered head to toe, and harassment and assault is rampant. I've had people say, well, she shouldn't go outside of she doesn't like the ""attention."" Literally telling women to ""wear"" a house to avoid harassment.

Secondly, it creates a dangerous precedent, blaming victims for their assault and excusing the actions of the perpetrator. You can imagine how quickly this extends beyond a simple comment in a gym. 

Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has had really scary, traumatic experiences and then been blamed for it by well-meaning men--and women--like you. When I came home crying and bleeding (at 15) after a guy grabbed me on the street and I fought him off, my own mother said, ""well, maybe you shouldn't wear such tight jeans."" No, maybe adult men shouldn't put their hands on children in the street. 

Perhaps this helps explain why your comment was so upsetting to me."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fff4lql,t1_ffeozux,1579875557.0,"Hey fuck face, I've been creeped on when I was wearing a fucking parka. I can't just ""stop wearing the thing,"" it's winter and I'd like to not get frostbite.

Maybe the creepers should just, as you say, control themselves like an adult. And not blame their actions on other people's clothes."
AnimalsBeingBros,fff1sk6,t1_ffeznyx,1579873352.0,I do that too
TwoXChromosomes,ffev5ag,t1_ffdyclj,1579866890.0,Fuck. That. Noise. She is both wrong and shitty.
AskReddit,fferalp,t3_esy81b,1579861631.0,"My marriage. We met the first day of freshman year and have been together ever since, in our thirties now. We got married at twenty one. Incredible that we could have made such a good decision when we were so young and stupid and barely even knew ourselves yet, much less what kind of person we should be with. Early marriages often fail for those reasons, but somehow we've built and happy, peaceful, fulfilling and fun relationship. He's a good guy, but also were just good together."

AskReddit,ffepdkx,t1_ffdv7ly,1579858754.0,"I remember my parents bitching about it in the 80s/90s. Like, why does every building have to have special stairs and bathrooms for like, one person to use??? I didn't even remember hearing them say that until your comment reminded me. It's so heartless and shitty."
Exvangelical,ffeble4,t3_eszn7w,1579842247.0,"This is absolutely me, I even was raised in Missouri as well. I got the constant harassment about my clothes and ""promiscuous spirit"" (basically just church leader lingo for ""slut"") even though I had never so much as held hands and was a virgin when I got married at 21. Everything was about saving yourself until marriage, and not just physically but also emotionally. Every crush you have is ""giving away your heart,"" basically cheating on your future husband. 

My friends were pressured into arranged marriages at 17-18, after extremely short, completely chaperoned ""courtships"" to avoid the risk of ""sinning."" Most of them didn't kiss or even hold hands until their wedding. My community literally called Joshua Harris a modern day prophet, but took his ideas even further into crazyland. 

I'm so glad I managed to escape that world. Some of my friends literally had to run away in the middle of the night. I helped my best friend elope, after her parents made her drop out of university and literally locked her in their house. It was all because she wanted to court a boy from church, but at age 15 her parents had made her promise that she would let them choose her husband. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice in helping her...she got to marry who she wanted, but she was only 18. She had six kids before she turned 30...

Anyway, I would love to talk about my experiences if you are interested. Feel free to dm me."
