medlabprofessionals,ffk08s8,t3_etz1io,1580011860.0,What kinds of issues are you having? How are these outpatient tests being drawn? At nurse coming to your home?
pics,ffjytj2,t1_ffjw9zg,1580010710.0,Don't make me come over there.
medlabprofessionals,ffjeby7,t1_ffj8i5h,1579996467.0,I went through a hospital based program. They offered students sign on bonuses. $1k up front and $1k after a year. They have little issues filing positions. The only time is if it's between graduations it can get tight until someone is finished.
medlabprofessionals,ffje4ea,t3_etxsxs,1579996342.0,"Wage wage wage. A sign on bonus is nice I guess if you basically are looking for relocation assistance, but I'd rather have increased pay each year even if it's a bit less than the sign on bonus. That's just me though."
aww,ffjd200,t3_etwro7,1579995726.0,"Ziggy, I like your fuzzy toes!"
medlabprofessionals,ffiv39p,t3_etuhji,1579983445.0,Everybody remember there are post bacc programs out there!
medlabprofessionals,ffilcje,t1_ffhp5bw,1579976627.0,Do you know where to find the info? It's online but their website is weird.
medlabprofessionals,fff7cdv,t3_et9brh,1579877552.0,"Where are you at?

When I started about 8 years ago, starting pay was $17.76. I'm in Alabama. 

The deep South, in general, is not as good. But cost of living makes up for it a bit."
funny,ffes5ks,t3_et75du,1579862915.0,"Ohhhhh, it knows it's going to the vet."
DIY,ffes2wx,t1_ffepvyg,1579862807.0,This is great. My little buddy I had outside was scared of enclosures too so the best I could do for him was a heating pad in a box. This blocks the wind so much better!
medlabprofessionals,ffeqtvo,t3_et7m7g,1579860954.0,"Was your internship part of your degree? If you have a bachelor's in Medical/clinical laboratory science you should be good.

Edit: I went back and checked the requirement. You only have to have a six month internship for route 1."
medlabprofessionals,ffe6wm8,t1_ffdesv9,1579838307.0,Exactly this ^ Works for blood centers.
pics,ffe5vdk,t3_estbts,1579837512.0,Where is this?
todayilearned,ffbsv9x,t1_ffba15e,1579781495.0,"Right. I get not everyone will have access to education, but this witchcraft stuff that still goes on I don't get."
retrogaming,ffb7rdo,t1_ffb6p00,1579754235.0,That's probably best.
medlabprofessionals,ffb16bc,t1_ff9swgx,1579749236.0,Lol. Come to the Southeast if you want to claim to be underpaid.
medlabprofessionals,ffb10ds,t3_esfojt,1579749123.0,"No, they don't require it."
retrogaming,ffb0txv,t3_esjycy,1579749001.0,"Situation

medlabprofessionals,ffb02x7,t3_esdr1s,1579748493.0,Online? There's also aum.edu
funny,ffayild,t1_ffa394p,1579747443.0,"Probably never cleans the litter box. When your first instinct is to go but new sheets instead of washing what you have, you're not all there."
funny,ffadujy,t1_ff8wdj5,1579733248.0,I think you need to be tested for an intellectual disability.
personalfinance,ff8tfqy,t3_es4to1,1579695437.0,"I think you have recourse to fight back. But I didn't want to say that even though the PDF you have from your doctor has the words referral on it it just sounds like an order for testing. The referral may have been ""his suggestion"" for where to get the echo done. A lot of orders are sent electronically now. I work in a hospital laboratory for reference, and I deal with a lot of outpatient orders."
funny,ff8o66o,t1_ff7x937,1579688452.0,I fucking understand taking someone to small claims court. Where some bored judge deals with dumb shit all day. Imagine the efficiency of dealing with legal recourse that focuses solely on tenant/landlord issues. What a novel idea that would be.
pics,ff8ddjf,t1_ff82p1n,1579673826.0,Definitely Alabama.
microbiology,ff8bmux,t3_es2857,1579672019.0,You could look for a lab assistant position in a hospital lab. Some will use them in Micro for setting up cultures and such.
funny,ff8b8kq,t1_ff79zn7,1579671627.0,That's slightly legible. The shit in the photo is from a serial killer.
personalfinance,ff8akie,t1_ff7i8le,1579670985.0,Yep. Got my 19 Camry in November. They were doing 0% to get them off the lot. It was a no brainer.
personalfinance,ff8a89p,t3_es26vc,1579670661.0,This thought was why I got a new car instead of used. I couldn't justify buying a 3 year old car for only 5k less than new.

videos,ff896h6,t1_ff7d10o,1579669686.0,There are 2 people on this thread that had circumcisions after puberty and both said there was no difference in sensation. For whatever that's worth. I don't have a penis.
worldnews,ff7ywzk,t1_ff7nll2,1579661680.0,My concern is the way their IDs look. A paper ID they are forced to laminate. The Grandpa trimmed his. Are Canadian driver's licenses paper? I wonder if the employee didn't recognize their identification and reacted inappropriately.
medlabprofessionals,ff7wmjg,t3_es4rk6,1579660104.0,It's becoming more of a non issue. But if it can be covered there is no reason to even worry.
funny,ff7un2v,t1_ff5selx,1579658764.0,Which is exactly the same as not having a tenants tribunal.
wiiu,ff5s7fy,t3_ert8pw,1579608233.0,They are high on eBay here in the US also. Somewhere around the same after conversion. Does eBay in Hungary offer money back guarantee?
LifeProTips,ff5rpct,t1_ff5qt4j,1579607646.0,This is what OP said. What did you read?
funny,ff5r7li,t1_ff5mgj5,1579607053.0,We don't have anything that deals with just TENANTS.
funny,ff5hy0h,t1_ff5ho47,1579593684.0,Lol. No we don't have that here. Sounds nice though.
Switch,ff5a5cd,t3_erp07e,1579584898.0,How long did you hold the power button?
