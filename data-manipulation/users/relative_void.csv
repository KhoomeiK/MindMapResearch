childfree,ffi6sdp,t1_ffi64eg,1579966592.0,I’ve never wanted to have kids but I was starting to get into the “well after I get married if an oops happens I might not abort” but then I remember shit like this. I even like kids! I adore my godson and enjoy being the cool “aunt” but giving birth and then being the primary care giver for one? Nope nope nope
AmItheAsshole,ffi6308,t3_etq8zt,1579966067.0,"Holy shit, NTA. Based on the title I thought it would be Y/TA but honestly the bit where you said you didn’t mind and didn’t “fix” the problem has nothing to do with you reporting it to HR. The problem would have been the same if you were housed with another woman and she did the same thing or even if you were both men. This isn’t an incident of you being given an opportunity to fix something you were uncomfortable with, this is a problem of someone letting strangers into your personal space while you were sleeping."
childfree,ffi5jox,t1_ffi2m1a,1579965657.0,That definitely sounds more like a phobia than a general and rational dislike/mild aversion. Having an actual physical reaction (nausea/gagging) is well outside.
