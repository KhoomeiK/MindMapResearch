I'm looking for a good house that is pretty active with chatting etc. I'm open to Facebook groups and messaging."
HumansBeingBros,fgn3d7a,t1_fgmhplr,1580936921.0,I have a scar on my shin from a car accident (and the resulting trauma required a skin graft).  I joke around that it looks like a shark bite because of the edges from the skin graft.

aww,fg97280,t3_exhma6,1580634936.0,"Oh man, this makes me think of my kitty Jet.  We adopted him from his foster home because he was so gentle and the other cats would beat him up (and he didn't fight back). 

I want to get him a friend, because he seems to get bored. But, it's like looking for a friend for a special needs kitty. I have to find one that matches his temperament. I'd hate for him to be scared in his own home."

AmItheAsshole,ffxunfi,t1_ffxoz9k,1580332759.0,Same. I'm an adult in So. Cal. I have different weight hoodies for different weather. Some are as thin as t shirts.  Some are even short sleeved.  It's just nice to have extra coverage.
