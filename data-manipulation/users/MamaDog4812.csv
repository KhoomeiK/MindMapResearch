Damnthatsinteresting,fecqgvd,t1_fecp7f1,1578980874.0,It's dry out here in the desert. Things don't grow very fast unless you water them. This looks like a pretty big guy to me for a mid to high desert area unless you start getting into the mountains like Mt. Charleston. You can go on google satellite view and see the area for yourself if you wanted to.

aww,fecadb6,t1_fe4j0r2,1578969523.0,"You'd be surprised. For instance I know that fossils of organisms (because evidence of the organism being alive such as markings, footprints, or waste products can also be fossils) are not growing. I know not all plant or animal fossils began with it dying and laying on the surface. Fossils have also been naturally preserved after something has fallen into sand traps, tree resin (fossilized tree resin is also known as amber), or oil pits.  There have been rare cases of well preserved seeds or spores that we were able to regenerate.... after planting them in the right conditions, as I mentioned these potatoes would need too, but one thing still remains the same- they did not continue growing or sprout any roots after falling on the ground or into these pits. Might want to know at least the definition of a subject before telling someone else they know nothing about it LMAO."

aww,fe3mnpp,t1_fe3bi3i,1578850689.0,"Have you ever seen a tomato or pomegranate tree sprouting INTO the ground from all the dead ones that fell off the existing tree?? That would be amazing!! lol. Anything that's tossed onto the ground just rots and dies, even some things that are planted don't really take so it's really hard to grow things without planting them and watering them just right and making sure they get the right amount of sunlight all day, and planting when the temperature is in a good range. Farming is hard, just getting a home garden started is tough."

aww,fdzywzz,t1_fdzv5rl,1578799145.0,"More like falling forward a little, just a stumble. Kids are clumsy, but very lightweight. The dog was just startled by the kid catching himself on him, not a big deal. If the kid fell with his body on the dog THAT would be painful and could cause the dog to nip, but that's not what is going on here. It is obvious that the dog is trying to be careful and is nervous about the clumsy kid, which should be watched carefully, but OP already said he was taking all the criticism into account."
aww,fdznvez,t1_fdzl3ny,1578792202.0,"Hahaha yeah, golden and black labs are notoriously lazy runners."
aww,fdzkjwr,t1_fdzatyi,1578791104.0,"You definitely know your son and dog better than anyone on here and even a behaviorist with as much experience as me would never be able to accurately say why exactly a pet is nervous from a few seconds of a video clip like this one, they could only point out what feelings body language like flinching, ear posture, tail wagging etc... conveys. Nervousness could absolutely be from not wanting to make you upset at all with how he's playing with your son since some dogs are very aware of wanting to please their people and they get really upset when they know that they have displeased anyone. Sounds like you have a very sweet, smart, and tolerant pup."
aww,fdzdiz8,t1_fdz5og9,1578789203.0,"It is very subtle so it's not nearly as big of a deal as some people on here are making it out to be. My comment was in response to the person saying their dog does that all the time, but now I think maybe they weren't talking about the flinching part. Your pup is a little nervous, but from your comments you seem like you're keeping a good watch on it and it's part of the learning process. I just hope your little guy doesn't accidently grab too hard is all. I've helped lots of people condition pets when expecting a new baby or introducing a pet to a family with children and, if it's any consolation, even though there is a little nervousness over ""what if"", nothing in this video is alarming and these two look like they're going to have a great life together so I hope you can just forget about all the overly negative comments because they're just jumping to conclusions.

aww,fdyxjhw,t1_fdyqsk9,1578784582.0,"The fur is not long enough to move that much just from being touched, it is definitely muscle movement, you can watch the entire muscle contract so you can see movement isn't happening just where the dog is being touched. Scared and nervous dogs with a gentle nature such as Labradors and Goldens absolutely lay with their head on the ground like that, waiting while being nervous... especially if they are trying to be still because they understand to be careful and have tolerance with children and puppies."
aww,fdyshjz,t1_fdw885q,1578783121.0,"I agree all kids should have a dog friend too, though I think between 3 and 5 years old is best for introducing pets, but it really depends on the family and type of pet. Birds need a lot more understanding and careful handling, but dogs and kids are the best pairing! Especially sweet Goldens like this one."
aww,fdyrndz,t1_fdy4ac3,1578782837.0,"While I agree with the dangers you are talking about (see my other comment), betting what someone would do or think is extremely arrogant. As an animal behaviorist (see my other other comment lol) even only seeing few seconds of this interaction I can tell the very worst this gentle golden would do is give a harsh warning nip, which could draw blood and create emotional distress and trust issues for both dog and child, but it's not like the dog is ever going to maul the kid and need to be put down. You're going a bit too far there. It is a potentially stressful situation, not a dangerous life threatening one."
aww,fdypkyf,t1_fdyicuz,1578782272.0,"I agree, it's not enough to condemn anyone and the video is super cute, but it is enough to make people worry for the safety of a child who has not mastered grasping control because that exact issue has caused many animals to react dangerously. While it's rare for a golden to react that way it does happen and even if this dog understands that children are not aware of what they do (most dogs that have had puppies or been around them make that connection with children too)  and would never bite the kid, it's still not fair for the dog to have to go through the emotional rollercoaster of joy, play, fear and pain that comes with kids that don't yet have grasping control. Anyone who has has their hair or beard pulled by a baby/ young toddler knows exactly what I mean lol... I'm cringing just thinking about it."
aww,fdyfwrv,t1_fdy74r0,1578779379.0,"Dog, Cat, Bird, and Horse behaviorist actually. Here's my site: https://furryandfeatheredformalities.com/. Your dog does what same thing, flinches? It doesn't take ANY type of training to understand that a flinch means fear. If your dog is flinching during play please seek a pet behaviorist (not just a trainer) to help you understand the cause of emotional distress your pet is going through. Could be a simple trust issue due to ineffective communication ability between species. If you are referring to how the dog is using its mouth to play with the child that is very gentle and careful and not at all what I was talking about."
aww,fdwzw80,t1_fdwjq15,1578763887.0,"I only thought the same thing because of the almost face grab at the end and the dog flinching when the kid touched his side right after. This kid hasn't learned to control his grip strength yet and I really hope he doesn't hurt the dog with it, but I would bite someone grabbing onto my face and skin like kids that young do. Letting kids this young touch dogs like that is very careless. I just hope it keeps being near grabs and never a full grab. Poor scared doggo. :("

funny,fct7dcc,t1_fcswgay,1577934815.0,Why do some people refer to them as cars instead of automobiles like they used to?

aww,fc6an31,t1_fc4w0td,1577476129.0,"Not everyone has money to throw at things like that. Also, it's not your house, you don't have to live in it. There's no reason to be a judgy bitch about something that has nothing to do with you. You don't know if they're doing construction or reorganizing right now, have medical problems, depression or if that's just how they like it. No matter what the reason is... (Unless someone or something is being hurt) you should quit being rude and not tell people what they ""need"" to do.

OP I think your house and fireplace looks cozy and your new cat is absolutely adorable."
