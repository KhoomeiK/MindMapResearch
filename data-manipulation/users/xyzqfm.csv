Average 4.5/5 star reviews

2) if your on a budget go for the Trek 820, bare minimum, but it still very good quality, good amount of gears, $450 CAD

When you go into a LOCAL BIKE SHOP, make sure you talk to them about what you need it for, how much cycling and listen to what they recommend
Also tell them your budgets

Checkout the ones I recommend on their website, the marlins have the best features for the price.

There is also Giant, Diamondback and Cannondale, but they have a smaller selection to choose from"

PublicFreakout,fewjhe9,t1_fewivvu,1579411870.0,"Bolts, screws and nuts on bikes need to be torque correctly, too tight and damage the frame irreversibly, too loose and it falls apart mid ride, and they usually need to be torqued differently.

Brakes need to be stiff, yet not make noise. they also need to made from good quality materials with a good design

Spokes need.to be tight and straight, to loose and you wheel crumples when you jump or bump into something, this is the most common problem, also many big box bikes come with wheels you can't allign.

Big box bikes are almost always steel which rust, is super heavy and there drivetrains suck ass

Don't buy Walmart Bikes, the cost of buying good parts to modify them is more expensive than just buying a new Trek or Diamondback from a bike shop
