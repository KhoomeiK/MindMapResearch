**Rankings were generated by a voting panel made up of media members.**  The media members were asked to vote for who they **feel** are the top  fighters in the UFC by weight-class and pound-for-pound. A fighter is  only eligible to be voted on if they are in active status in the UFC.

A  fighter can appear in more than one weight division at a time. The  champion and interim champion are considered to be in the top positions  of their respective divisions and therefore are not eligible for voting  by weight-class. However, the champions can be voted on for the  pound-for-pound rankings."

But Cowboy has a lot of milage in his body, he probably should thinking of retiring from the game. He took a lot of damage during his carreer.

Conor did very well against him, but honestly, i'm not really impressed, they served Conor an old animal who had a lot of battles. It was a warm-up offered by Dana for his return. The next fights of Conor will be the real tests."

For the Khabib VS Tony fight, I think it can go both ways... I have a hard time saying who will win this. But for sure, its the biggest test of Khabib's carreer yet.

And for Conor, if it's not Khabib next, I think Dana would go with Masvidal. That would generate more $$$$ than Garthje... sadly for Gaethje he's not 'big' enough PPV wise."
