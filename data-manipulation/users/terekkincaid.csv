MSI_Gaming,ffaycl8,t3_esmd2j,1579747335.0,"Technically none of them.  But, you'll get the sound you're looking for from the red Line out.  Depending on your headphones and the jack the signal might be a bit strong (meaning it will sound loud and distorted, even if you tune down the volume).  A line out is supposed to be designed to go to a secondary processor (amp, etc).  But, it will probably work with your headphones."
MSILaptops,ffau9cn,t3_eslkfj,1579744626.0,"You used liquid metal in a laptop.  This is what happens, and why everyone in this subreddit recommends against it.  If you don't block it in with pads, it can shift around.  One short and BAM, something gets fried.  Kryonaut is great, but Conductonaut should only be used on stationary machines."
