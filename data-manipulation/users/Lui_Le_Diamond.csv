I was becer going to bring up the 97% thing, I never said it was accelerating, and even did my matg under the assumption it wouldn't, and yes it has been very well documented, despite what the site subtitled ""Stewereds of creation"" say, that C02 warms the air."
facepalm,fehpyr2,t1_fehot73,1579121547.0,"I've never heard that claim that winter is getti g milder, and you just stated things, which doesn't prove anything. You didn't link or mention a single source. Climate change isn't as simple as Earth warm, it's complicated as all hell, more extreme winters aren't supposed to happen to this degree. 

If you want evidence we're warming too quickly, just look to the PETM, which raised the Earth's temperature by a maximum of 8 degrees Celsius over the course of 6000 years. https://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7739

Taking NASA's current warming data into account as stated here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/evidence.amp we can do some simple math. 

They state that most of the warming of 1.62 degrees Celsius has occurred in the past 35 years. By being incredibly liberal and saying that only amounts to say, 51% 1.62*0.51=~0.83°C over 35 years. Taking that and dividing it by 35 gives us an annual rate of 0.02°C. Multiplying that by 6000, the same rate the PETM warmed up at, we get 120°C. That means at our current rate we're warming up by 15x as much as the PETM, one of the most extreme warming perioda in Earth's history aince life formed, and that's a super conservative estimate."
