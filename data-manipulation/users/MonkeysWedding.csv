You've dealt with the supply side. Sure more people will produce masks as it's worthwhile but production takes time which we don't have. But in your 'free' market, poor people get no masks. You deal with the demand too by limiting purchases.. an analogy that may resonate: walmart has been and jerrys at 70% off, 4 per customer."

worldnews,feh9ttx,t1_fegofse,1579112139.0,"It's not so much power play but rather history and sticking with the government you has relations with previously.

Think of it in terms of the handmaids tale: mainland America gets taken over by some revolutionaries; the government flees from DC to Alaska. Everybody complains about it but there is not much anybody can do about it. World governments stay friendly with the US government in exile and sanction the crazy revolutionaries.

In theory this rides itself out until the revolution stalls and is weakened. The legitimate government come back with a coup and all is well again.

The problem is that the revolutionaries have been immensely successful and world governments aren't really in a position to shun them - in fact they are keen to get involved with them.  Getting involved comes with strings and that usually involves recognising the revolutionaries as the true successors"
