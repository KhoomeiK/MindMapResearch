Flying tomorrow for the first time in 2 years. Not the first time since I’ve lost the big weight though (80lb). I lost more since then but then gained some back so I’m about eh.. ~8lb lighter than I was 2 yrs ago. I used to not be able to put the tray down all the way because I was so big so I still have anxiety thinking about flying tomorrow but I’m just trying to remind myself I’m not that size anymore and last time I flew I had SO much room it was a whole new experience."
