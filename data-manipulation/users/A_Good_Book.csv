The problem is, when I query the database, you can't even choose North Korea from the list of countries. Maybe /u/Gauss-Legendre can help out?

I ticked **No. of deaths - Malnutrition, both sexes** under **No. of deaths - Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases**, and then went on to look for North Korea (or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) in **Total reporting countries** but I can't find it."

elderscrollsonline,ffir1y6,t3_etuy2k,1579980574.0,"I'm very against microtransactions and ESO is a pretty bad offender with its crown store and loot boxes. Disgusting business practice that should be illegal. I don't mind the subscription though, nor its benefits, but I'll say that it's very difficult to go back to playing without it once you've gotten used to the crafting bag. Also getting all the DLCs is a huge plus.

Overall is it worth getting the game, despite the microtransactions? Yes, definitely."

Yes, this is true, and this is relatively new information (at least to me)."

I'm curious to see this research, how do they create NDE and how do they measure the response?"

worldnews,ffeqajo,t1_ffep8cf,1579860146.0,">what do we know about the people who died? Were they elderly, or infants, or already sick or weakened? Or were they healthy adults? 

Nothing, which is why it's bullshit to throw around random numbers saying it's 10 times or 60 times more likely to die from the flu.

>Also, the numbers are too low to start talking about percentages and comparing it to other sicknesses that many millions of people get. Statistical noise in small samples leading to big scares and such is just ridiculous.

I agree, it was just a point to demonstrate how it's stupid to compare it to the flu or showering."

I live in Sweden and Sweden is not socialist. Period. Neither is any other Scandinavian country, or any other European country for that matter. It's strange too because the only ones who are making this mistake are Americans."
