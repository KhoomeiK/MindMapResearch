instantkarma,ff88b4i,t1_ff6v6mn,1579668906.0,Yeah I don’t know everything about this interaction. But yeah he probably shouldn’t have choked him out. The guy didn’t hit anybody and could have ended up walking away. Seems a little bit of an over reaction

visualsnow,ff1shvn,t3_epcmn1,1579485193.0,Thank you so much for sharing this. You don’t know how much relief I got when I read your post and everyone’s replies. It’s comforting knowing other people also experience this kind of visual activity.
visualsnow,ff1s9gh,t1_feje8i5,1579485045.0,Wow. I thought I was alone. I explained what I was seeing to my grandparents when I was younger and they just told me to go lie down for a bit. This video is pretty much how I see except it’s not near as bad as in your video. I typically only see it when it’s really bright outside or after I’ve been physically active. Thanks for sharing this.

politics,fdizq3p,t1_fdiyh3t,1578454797.0,You’re a bit delusional. He doesn’t want this and has spoken against senseless wars even before he started campaigning. We drew lines in the sand and Iran crosses them. We have been pulling out of the ME and Iran has kicked us time and time on our way out the door. It appears as though we have been acting in good faith while Iran hasn’t been doing the same. Remove the hateful blinders.
politics,fdizf2o,t1_fdiy5yt,1578454588.0,Just shows how much you truly understand. Your hatred has blinded you.

They have been acting in bad faith. Trump campaigned on not having another Benghazi happen especially under his presidency, what the hell do you people think is going to happen? They have been hitting us over and over. We drew the line in the sand and they crossed it. Sorry bout your luck."
worldnews,fdhhgf6,t3_el7gyo,1578422727.0,Number is up to 180. Damn that is a lot of assholes. Deliberately setting fires... who would do this and why? What is there to gain from this? Who are you trying to get at by doing this? What message? Or what evil do you wish to inflict?
worldnews,fdhh67z,t1_fdf3bzn,1578422557.0,I dont know anything about this guy or why he did this or that. But its possible to be concerned about the environment and wanting a cleaner earth and be compassionate towards animals but believe that climate change isnt caused by humans alone. There are many shades of gray.

There are African descendants in this country that didn’t come from the slave trade.


So would my family be responsible for all African descendants? How do we determine who gets reparations and who has to pay and exactly how much?"

And if the government came in and forced everyone to disarm...guess which kind of people would hide and keep them. Then now you have a certain type of person who now knows old ms Betty down the street no longer has a fighting chance with a young 20 something with a gun, she no longer has a fair chance. If it’s assumed everyone has guns, then they would be less likely to take such a risk. Venezuela got their guns removed sometime around 2013 and look where that got them... fired upon by their own government. How would Hong Kong be handled if they were allowed to own guns? A hell of a lot better. We deserve a right to defend ourselves. Whether it was the Middle Ages with swords, or modern times with guns, we deserve that right."
