Fantasy,fdd04k2,t3_dfjdgk,1578289618.0,"This post is fairly old, but I'm up late and a past experience has popped into my head and perhaps writing about it will exorcise it.

It was about twelve years ago: I was an awkward and eager undergraduate coming toward the end of his degree, and also attending a games convention where a Famous Author was a guest.

And by 'was a guest' I specifically mean she had a stand she sat behind where people could come up and talk to her. This was an Irish convention; they're not big. Couple hundred attendees at most.

The convention hall was fairly deserted, actually. I recall specifically that because she was both short and sitting down, and because there was no chair on my side, I had to awkwardly take one knee in front of the stand to even attempt to converse eye to eye rather than loom down over her.

I mentioned I was a fan of her work, and how I was hoping to do postgraduate research on gay relationships in fiction. And how I really loved the representation of X and Y as a gay couple in her book Z.

She fixed me with a glare and said curtly *'I don't comment on the canonicity of that relationship.'*

Then she just ... stopped talking and ignored me. She said nothing else. I was a bit shellshocked. Her husband came back in a few seconds and she turned away and talked exclusively with him until I just ... got up and left.

It's twelve years later. I know it's ridiculous. But I have *never* gotten over that treatment. I've gone over how I came across, whether I made her feel uncomfortable, whether she (known for being LGBTQ-inclusive) was having a bad day ... but the end of the day is, she was cruelly rude to a quite young person who was only trying to politely gush about how he related to her work, for no reason I can figure out.

And even to this day I get angry thinking about it. I can't hear her brought up without remarking on how awful she was in person. I had to study some of her work for that postgrad (yes, I did do it) and was gritting my teeth to do it.

Authors, as Janny said (who herself was very nice and encouraging in a brief online interaction around about the same period of my life), do remember the impact you can have on people and the responsibility you have when your job at a convention is literally 'meet your fans'.

There are probably enough clues in here for someone clued-in enough to figure out who it was.

*EDIT: I named the author at the end in the first version, but to honour Janny's principles of true/kind/necessary I've removed her name, since at best it was only two of those.*"

Yes and no. If I knew a student was in OP's position, there were a couple of accommodations I could have made if necessary without making things unfair to other students (a dangerous concept in the first place, honestly - where I'm from classes aren't graded on a curve, so unless it's egregious individual support isn't considered through that lens).

In particular, I could use it to justify:

- Flexibility on deadlines, within reason
- A prearranged request for a different exam time/location if possible
- Flexibility on format (if OP doesn't have reliable access to a PC/printing I might accept a handwritten paper even if I normally don't)
- Loaning them books/hardcopy papers
