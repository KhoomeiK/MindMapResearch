No, you're absolutely right, life is complicated enough without creating unnecessary restrictions on communication. I honestly think that these kind of freakouts give people a false sense of self-importance, which then makes them become pretentious as they seek to control everyone's narrative. 

The irony is that, at one time, we used to want to throw off the shackles of limitations and restri tions placed upon us by what we considered to be an ""oppressive"" society. Fast forward to present time, and we have people claiming to be against that same oppressive, ""authoritarian"" system, while simultaneously putting even *more* restrictions and limitations on people by demanding they act in accordance with whatever they say. 

It's fucking ridiculous, laughable, and in my opinion, they can just fuck right off and eat a dick. Sorry for the language, but I have no more patience or sympathy for people who *choose* to be that undeniably stupid."
TrueOffMyChest,ffaamaz,t1_ffa1pxq,1579731146.0,"Depends how old one is. If they're an adult, the answer should be quite obvious: gay bars/clubs, etc.

At very least, one could make new friends who are more open-minded, and/or more tolerant of alternative lifestyles."
TrueOffMyChest,ff9kuug,t1_ff9h4j1,1579715133.0,"Yeah, fully agree. Basically, if you're an adult, then yeah, you're under no obligation whatsoever to validate your dad's opinion just because he wants to be right. 

The way I see it is this: someone says I should do something --> I say ""who are you?"" --> They say I'm not allowed to do/say ""x-y-z"" --> I say ""Fuck off."" --> They get offended. --> I don't care, and move on with my life."
TrueOffMyChest,ff9gg0q,t1_ff9ejvw,1579712479.0,"Well, while that's tragic, and I'm sorry you had to experience that, it doesn't really fit the category of people demanding other people do things that I was talking about in the OP. Instead, it's a disagreement over lifestyle choice, which is a bit of a different issue (although I can see where the misunderstanding came from). 

See, you and your uncle took the right approach imo, remaining civil while being able to disagree with one another. 

Now, if your dad *demanded* that you not be trans, and you in turn are an adult legally allowed to make your own decisions, then yeah... he's in the wrong and it fits the OP scenario. 

But, you must understand that it works both ways: If you *demand* that your dad conform to your point of view, and insinuate that he's *not allowed* to disagree, then it's the same thing."

TrueOffMyChest,ff8icjf,t3_es8p11,1579679827.0,"Well... here's the bright side: you *are* selfish (everyone is, to a point), problem is yours is misdirected. Instead of doing things for yourself once in a while, or fulfilling your own needs, you (probably subconsciously) fill those needs through seemingly selfless altruism. 

Subconsciously, you get a certain amount of pleasure from helping other people, from appearing meek and going unnoticed.... only your rational mind realizes there's a problem with that, it detects a deficiency. It's illogical. 

One thing that shows in your post is that you're *aware* that you're unnoticed. You repeated several times how unselfish you are, which shows that you want people to see you as unselfish, which.... directs focus toward yourself. See? Misdirected. 

It's probably safe to say you're a bit narcissistic (don't worry, again, everyone is to a certain point). It may just be that your levels are a bit off-center. It's nothing to worry about probably, neuroses are common these days, and it's to be expected with the types of environments (both public and private) that people are often subjected to, or subject themselves to.

I'd suggest speaking with a therapist, in addition to your lawyer, figure things out rationally and reasonably, then *logically* consider your next series of steps. 

Don't worry, I've met all kinds of ""selfless"" people who were, in reality, *very* selfish (they just lacked self-awareness). Here's to hoping you aren't like any of them, because none of them could see they were actually toxic psychic-vampires masquerading as innocent victims."

rap,fezev6p,t3_eqph9l,1579456595.0,"Wasn't sure exactly who to reply to, so I'll just throw this out in the aether: 

Nah, I wouldn't necessarily throw the whole 'mumble Rap' category in there, some of it I find pretty good, while some of it is definitely cringey. For example, I'm not really a fan of Kodak Black (or however you spell his name), but I wouldn't classify him as Cringe (although he definitely laid down a cringey freestyle I saw in a cringe-compilation video. 

Now, to be clear, I don't agree with all the artists included in the video I referenced in the OP. I didn't mention it in the beginning because I thought it'd be obvious. Based on the 3 artists I mentioned in the OP, it should be pretty easy to clearly delineate what is cringe and what isn't. 

Like, I mean, rappers who can actually Rap, but whole politics or social stance one doesn't particularly care for, that doesn't make them Cringe necessarily. On the other hand, artists who claim to be the best, or puff up their own talent, when they have absolutely no skill whatsoever (to a hilarious degree), to me that constitutes Cringe. Of course, there's probably some subjective overlap in how others would classify some artists, but that's what makes it interesting. 

Now, we know that (probably) T-Dub's ""Mario Be Playin"" is done for fun and not really serious. Still, it would be a classic of the genre at this point, imo. Icejjfish, on the other hand, seems serious about his craft (which borders on being 'mystifyingly unlistenable'). 

And Viper is just a legend, he's gotta be the real God of Cringe-Rap.
