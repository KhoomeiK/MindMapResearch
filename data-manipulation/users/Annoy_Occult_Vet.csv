SandersForPresident,ffkct7q,t1_ffjkma5,1580020659.0,"I am a British man and I work in the US as a registered nurse. My wife is diabetic and I recently changed hospitals to work closer to home (other place was first job out of nursing school). Because I had a job change I had a lapse in medical insurance. 

She was running low on insulin so I contacted pharmacies to see what I could do about getting insulin without insurance. Best they could offer was for me to call the insulin maker. Luckily they could give me a one time voucher for a 30 day supply (she uses a very concentrated form of insulin). 

The pharmacist said it was great they could give me that voucher because the cash value of the vial (she uses a pump) was 2 thousand dollars. I walked away stunned not knowing what to say. 

I miss the NHS."
