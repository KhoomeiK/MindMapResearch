offmychest,ffq6r8h,t3_eumkhd,1580123505.0,"He needs the therapy! From what it sounds like, this isn't him, this isn't who he's been before. It may just take some time and a trainer professional to help him. I don't think he means what he says to you, I think he's losing his shit inside and doesn't know what else to do or how to cope."
relationships,ffq6o8r,t3_eumhbr,1580123382.0,I don't have any advice but I just wanted to say I'm so sorry you've had to deal with so much and you're a strong person! Take care and I hope you can overcome the fear. Thank you for sharing your experience here and I hope you're able to find what you're looking for.

If someone is having doubts or isn't sure how the hell do they break things off or have a serious chat when the other person bought them a 6 grand bracelet and car?! It's like ownership in my eyes and I absolutely don't believe that was your intention but it can come across as though you own her through giving her these ridiculous gifts. And I'm sorry, no matter how rich you are, they are ridiculous, especially for the amount of time you've been dating."
