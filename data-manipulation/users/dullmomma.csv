Scams,fe6c3zo,t3_enwmfl,1578886659.0,"Sadly, Malaysia has become a hot bed for scamming. They trick ""employees"" by giving them a real job which they work at for a few months, and then slowly introduce scam work without the worker realising. It is then that they divulge the scamming when it's too late.

Most are foreign nationals who hand over their passports, and are virtually trapped.

This does not excuse what they do, but I feel sorry for them that they are unknowingly scammed themselves."
