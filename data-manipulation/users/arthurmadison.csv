We have the longest running royal court in the nation, one year longer than SF where the court system began. Imperial Sovereign Rose Court [www.rosecourt.org](https://www.ISRC.org) has 'bioqueens' that are voted in as Empress. Women do drag as women all the time. Straight ciswomen and bisexual ciswomen and even cislesbians do drag as women.
