Multicopter,ff8wr57,t3_es84eb,1579698622.0,"DC is measured in Volts and Amps. For this example, imagine Voltage as ""pressure"" that pushes power to your fan. The higher the voltage, the higher the pressure. Voltage that's too high can damage your fan. Now, imagine Amps as a ""rope"" that the fan can pull to draw power. If the battery doesn't have enough Amps (mAh) it won't be able to power the device for very long.

and when a LiPo goes below 3.0v per cell, it's damaged. below that, it'll die."
