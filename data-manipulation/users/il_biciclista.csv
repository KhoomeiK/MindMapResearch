news,ff3154i,t1_ff24yzr,1579530900.0,"If I'm understanding you correctly, 7,000+ includes double counting a horse who races twice at the park. Is that correct? 

If that's the case, then 50/7,000+ is the chance of a horse dying in one race. Let's round it to 8,000 horses to be conservative. That's a 0.6% chance of dying in one race, or an 11% chance of dying in 20 races. That seems awfully high."

I'm just saying that from a safety standpoint, if there is any reasonable mistake that can lead to someone being trapped in your building, then your fire exits have failed to serve their purpose."

AskReddit,fe32hj3,t1_fe2v1b9,1578845252.0,I actually think you're right. What bothers me more than the plot hole is the fact that it could have been easily cleared up with a line of dialogue. Thanos could have just said that he only believes murder is justified if it's completely random.

todayilearned,fd977y0,t1_fd8jqct,1578229411.0,">So what do you propose is the ethical course of action here? 

1. We could all try to boycott products that are produced with slave labor. I don't know what all of those products are, but I do know that it's easy to find fair trade chocolate and coffee. It is, however, difficult to find fair trade electronics, so...

2. The US courts could start enforcing the conflict minerals clause of the Dodd-Frank bill. This is a law that was already passed in 2010, that says any company that uses conflict minerals (mined by slaves) has to report that in their financial statements. It's not much, but it's a step in the right direction. 

Sadly, the courts ruled that this law was unconstitutional, based on corporate personhood. Basically, corporations have more rights than human beings.
