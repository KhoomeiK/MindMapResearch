However when you’re on a team its always better to let your team know there’s a sleeping enemy and it’s a free kill."
OverwatchUniversity,fff82p2,t1_ffexyph,1579878054.0,"GM may be a different ball game. While I agree there are a lot of games where you can’t tell what went wrong without a replay, there are others where one person definitely stands out.

For example. I had a game as mccree where I would repeatedly be in our own back line, next to Ana, and at 40 health for a good minute. This is with both asking for heals with the button and in voice. So yea in cases like that I can tell who made the game harder for me personally, which means me and that dude just don’t gel well as teammates"
OverwatchUniversity,fff7bzv,t1_fferrvf,1579877544.0,"Honestly I feel like as long as the dps isn’t throwing it’s rarely their fault, I think it’s the “easiest”role in the game at least game sense wise. As long as healers heal and tanks make space dps just has to hit shots.

The only time I start questioning dps is if fights drag on too long with little to no kills. And even then could just be a team issue of not focusing targets.

So yea I agree. Avoiding dps can be a waste of time

Edit: this isn’t from a salty dps main. I can’t play dps anymore with the long ques and routinely defend dps in game. I’ll go “look I was flanking in hog and our Ana got dove and died. So now your dps got no heals and they couldn’t do their job. Next fight/round I’ll stay in the back line and protect the healers.” Overall owning up to mistakes can be a powerful anti-tilt tool"

I feel like after 5 in a row you’re as impressed as if he did 10"
OverwatchUniversity,ff36jy0,t1_ff2j8m4,1579534885.0,"Perfect thank you! Yea the big thing I’ve been doing recently is cooldown management. In deathmatch I win most duels but in game I do stupid stuff like sleep a Zarya bubble.

In my defense first death involved me yelling at rein to drop and my team to group so I was a little distracted. Another thing I’m trying to balance is focusing on my game rather than always shot calling.

Also 6:33 was so funny. My plan was just to heal as much as I could because I figured I was already dead. Guess his aim also sucks lol.

Questions:

would you say I should prioritize cooldowns for when enemy already engaged to react to mistakes? Or is it also good throughout the game to gets antis just for the ult charge before a fight. I don’t want to miss out on damage but also don’t know how much higher ranks would punish something like that. For example my rank is already pretty good at punishing rushed mei walls but I don’t think I’ve ever heard a teammate tell our flanker that they saw Ana waste sleep/nade 

And how often do you quickscope? I haven’t taken the time to learn it but if it’s necessary I will

I’ve heard a few times to use high ground more so I’ve been looking out for that. Where would you position on dorado third? Would you take the time to take the left highground? I didn’t know where else to hold but I was trying for rotate when our team was pushed"
OverwatchUniversity,ff1gefc,t1_ff1dh8o,1579478814.0,Lol you should see some gameplay from a few weeks ago. This is me toning down cooldown usage
OverwatchUniversity,ff13dgu,t1_ff0p4a5,1579474786.0,Yea I’ve been working on saving cooldowns. It’s hard to balance not holding on to them too long while also having them for important moments
OverwatchUniversity,fetvi4c,t1_fetqtq5,1579380486.0,"She feels better to play but I really can’t see a reason to run her. Still has a huge crit box, mei still demolishes her, and dm (arguably her most important ability) is still nerfed.

Maybe Numbani point A for high ground hopping? I can’t really think of another map where she’s optimal. Not saying you can’t play her because meta means shit in comp, but if we’re discussing best tanks I don’t think dva is even in the conversation"
OverwatchUniversity,fetfbsj,t1_fet6zue,1579374879.0,"Fair, buffs in general are dangerous. Dva was meta for so long just because it’s so useful eating ults. Maybe nerf what she can eat while still allowing her to eat orisa halt?

Idk man. Orisa halt is just such a good ability that she’s almost necessary. Mini grav on what? 7 seconds?"
OverwatchUniversity,fet647o,t1_fet5fv9,1579372153.0,"I was so excited to try new dva...nope. She’s still fragile as ever, there needs to be some kind of dm buff before we can think about seriously playing her again. It’s sad because a meta counter for orisa halts would make me so happy.

I’m on record: orisa half, mei multi-freeze, and widow walls are some of my least favorite things in the game.
