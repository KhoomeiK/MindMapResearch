SuddenlyGay,fej6doz,t1_fej2fte,1579158749.0,"Also the fact that if a woman applied & got a construction job she'd be the only female at her company which would, justifiably, make her uncomfortable. Like that just increases the chances of having workplace issues since she'll literally be the only female onsite. 

Also most construction workers are contractors so if the female employee was being harassed she'd have less resources than someone at a company with a HR dept, union, or whatever."

I honestly can't relate, if I'm gaming it's to have a good time,  not be stressed tf out!"
