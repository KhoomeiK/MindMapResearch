2nd, the Netherlands is the 2nd largest exporter by value, not by volume, another significant difference. The Dutch agricultural industry is focused on high value, low volume, goods for export. Seeds are a good example of this. The Netherlands is one of the top producers of seed because growing seeds requires relatively little space, and is a great product to sell to other people. 

This isn't to downplay the serious innovations the Netherlands has and continues to make to agriculture. They've been doing some amazing stuff in regards to using technology to improve efficiency. But they can't, and aren't trying to, feed the world with their system. They're the Ferrari of agriculture, not the Ford."
