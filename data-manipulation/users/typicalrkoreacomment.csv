howto,ffgqb9k,t1_ffggc8l,1579912345.0,Yea I would also recommend just using the wire normally and using shrink tubing in areas when the wire starts to wear down.

AskMen,ffgo1xc,t1_fffy2de,1579910749.0,"Firefly has that late 90's early 2000's charm that I don't really think can be captured again on tv. Kind of like Full House or any other 90's sitcom that people grew up with. It would just be terrible today.

They also killed off a main character in the firefly movie serenity."

Never traveling is a ""factor"" is what I said. I never said it ""causes racism"". Internet has opened up a lot of things for young generations but it's quite different to experience in person."
news,ffgn2un,t1_ffgmpsv,1579910071.0,"Countries all around the world do things differently in terms of government, education, welfare, and lifestyle. Being never exposed to ""culture"" is the key. And I know they teach American kids that America is a ""melting pot"" but that just isn't true."

[Majority of Americans Never Leave Home](https://nypost.com/2018/01/11/a-shocking-number-of-americans-never-leave-home/). It's a big factor in why there's so much amount of racism in the US and why there are people who think like Trump.

howto,fffnqta,t1_fffaogp,1579887907.0,Yea I was confused to why he needed to wrap the wire around the pencil. I think it's just so it stays in place. That's it. They really made it more complicated than it is. It's just wire connecting both ends of the battery with a switch.
