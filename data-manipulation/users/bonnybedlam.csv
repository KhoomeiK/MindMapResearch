JUSTNOMIL,ffg1vwi,t3_ddm3vp,1579896664.0,"Wow, that's annoying! I feel so sad for your mom, tho. Imagine having so little going on that your only hobby/interest/social interaction was stirring up shit with your family? When you move out she's going to go completely insane with boredom."
JUSTNOMIL,fffvd1w,t1_fffl6dl,1579892612.0,"I'm so sorry but that dog's got to go. Either that or your child never visits their home, not even with you right there. If something happens it will happen too fast for you to stop even if LO is in your arms. MIL clearly doesn't see a problem letting this dog attack her husband and son so you can't trust her to keep it shut away from your child. She's already chosen her late son's dog over her grandchild. That's her right. All you have to do is be okay with it. Don't argue or explain any more than you already have, just invite her to your place and when she complains, shrug and remind her that she's the one who chose to keep the dog.

If it helps, here's a story you might share with your DH. \*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING FOR DOG ON CHILD HARM\*\*\* In elementary school one of the boys in my class got bitten on the face by a medium-large dog. Not a really big dog, but big enough that the bite-to-face ratio was significant on a 9 yo. I don't want to go into detail but it wasn't something they could really fix. Not so that he'd ever look like someone who didn't get bit by a dog when he was small. ETA: Sorry, that reads so cryptic. He lived and recovered, just with a lot of scars."

And of course since they can't not think about it, they can't imagine anyone else not thinking about it all the time, too. My FIL lived with us to save money, hoarded nickels like squirrels hoard nuts while we were scrimping to keep the lights on, and he was constantly fussing at us about his biggest concern in life: what to do with all that cash just sitting there?!?! It kept him up nights.

Of course a thousand replies sprung immediately to mind--from the sensible to the frustrated to the obscene--but he didn't want an answer. He just wanted to talk about it."

""Hey, Mom, remember that hilarious joke you got off about us sleeping apart the night before the wedding? Gather 'round, kids, you'll love this. Your Nana was *so* funny!""

Also, I just caught up on your history. Is this better or worse than when she wouldn't come to your place when you were home? Also, your ring is gorgeous, your FDH is a rockstar, and I'm so, so sorry about your father. That's so tough. And then to have her do what she did? 

I admit I laughed a little because it was so ridiculously absurd, I heard the Family Guy announcer voice in my head going, ""*YOU'VE* GOT A *JUST NO*"". It sounds like you can handle it, though. Congratulations on the wedding, and gaining control thereof!"

I can't actually imagine how horrible it must be to have your own mother cause you irreparable physical harm--let alone be able to literally taste it years after--but discovering your body has fixed itself to the extent that the damage doesn't show has to be the best feeling there is. I can't wait to learn more of your story. I can tell you're going to do great!

I don't have to worry when my German shepherd is around because she will defend the kitties with her life. She also adores all other dogs and people, and especially enjoys small children. Even the toddlers who grab onto her ears to steady themselves before shrieking in her face and poking her in the eye. Check my profile for pictures of her being adorable as a puppy, and playing with my brother on the beach. She's my second GSD and I plan to never have another breed."
JUSTNOMIL,ffdu26m,t1_ffc9zg8,1579828931.0,"Seriously, if they can't even sit at the same table with the other parents, or condescend to walk you down the aisle without making it all about themselves, just don't. You already know they hate the venue, the dress, the guests, and apparently the groom. That's enough of a taint on the day without having to actually look at them while you're getting married. You want people at your wedding who are happy about your marriage, or at least happy that you're happy about it. Sadly that doesn't seem to be them. My dad passed before I met my DH so we had a friend step in. Maybe you have an aunt and uncle or a set of grandparents who would enjoy being honorary parents of the bride. It's not ideal, but it sounds like you're used to that."
JUSTNOMIL,ffd9z2s,t1_ffc58ct,1579816342.0,I guess you can't win them all. But you still did good.
JUSTNOMIL,ffd2qmm,t1_ffcuxsp,1579812261.0,"I had an aunt like this. She was constantly talking about her money and how much she was leaving to who. For context, since she didn't have kids of her own and her siblings were all gown and retired, she settled on ""the grandkids"", i.e. her siblings' children. Over the years the amount changed as she grew wealthier but she was always firm that it was *just* the grandkids. Not their kids--some of whom were also grown by the time she died. I knew she hated my mom (for totally bullshit and utterly degrading reasons) but my dad was her favorite brother, so she went back and forth on me and my sister. My sister was clearly her GC and I was the ~~trash fire~~ SG, but after Dad died she started seeing us both as ""\[Mom's name\]'s daughters"". 

Yet she never stopped talking about the division of her wealth and the specifics of her will. So imagine my feelings when I received a letter from her lawyer stating that as a legal heir he was obligated to notify me (officially, in writing, legalese, blah blah) that my aunt had died and that I was not to inherit from her estate. Further, the estate was in a trust and could not be challenged. My sister, too.

And for some reason I was still shocked and hurt to see the next generation of cousins driving her vehicles, not to mention buying everything from homes to horses with their inheritance. That was how we found out she hated us. That's where your DH is right now. They've done the worst things they can think of--taken away the money and the love. She focuses more on the money but don't gloss over the ""I won't love or even like you anymore"" bit. That's the theme. The rest is just exposition. Don't talk about the money or bother trying to assure him she doesn't mean it. Focus on making him feel loved by you and whoever else you know you can count on. He needs so much love right now."

Once when I was single I went away for a week and left my shy kitty with her. They knew each other, I got him as a teenager and when I first moved out I left him behind for a while until I could get the pet deposit together, but it had been a few years and he didn't remember. She let him hide under her bed as long as he wanted to, only coming out when she was at work, until eventually he started creeping forth in the evening to get cuddles in front of the tv. 

I always knew I could trust her with my helpless little ones. If she'd offered to watch a human child overnight I would have allowed it without question. But I think a well-behaved cat who was only visible for 5 of the 9 days he was present was more her speed.

Reading some of the JN posts makes me think that a lot of these MILs want the fun of a do-over baby but they don't want to do the work of raising a child properly. If they cared about that they wouldn't need do-overs. I very much appreciate my mom not wanting to put her daughters through things we couldn't handle just so she could have more fun the second time around. 

I'm sure she was doing that with the pets to a certain extent, playing with our puppies and kittens instead of getting her own, but that's actually okay. They needed more playing with, she never asked to take them anywhere, and she never, ever pressured us to get more just because she wanted them.

She did once ask my sister if she didn't think she already had enough cats. My sister said ""no"" and got another cat. Mom didn't say a damn thing. Her house, her family, her cats. Mom just petted them and called them all Pretty Kitty. Because all cats are Pretty Kitties, regardless of their relative merits, just as all grandpets are equal.

So there was one good MIL out there. My husband got her and now she's gone. But the memories of her not being a bitch will live forever."

Don't have a MIL (she died before I met DH, tho I'm assured she was dreadful), but I wanted to share something I always appreciated about my own mom (sadly also deceased and much mourned). From a very young age--like as soon as I found out it was an option--I knew I didn't want kids. Even at five and six I felt like I was making my parents poor, and maybe crazy because wow did they worry about shit, and I didn't want that. 

Naturally Mom told me I'd change my mind. Every girl goes through that phase, some day you'll meet the right man and he'll want kids (me: if he does he's not the right man), who's going to take care of you when you're old--all that good stuff. And then I hit my teens and my previously not such a big deal that we have to acknowledge it genetic muscle wasting disease kicked into high gear and between the dangers to me and the likelihood of my kids inheriting it, I got really vocal about staying child free. A lot of people argued, badly, stupidly, about something they didn't understand at all. But not my mom. She loved me but she understood why I'd hesitate to make more of myself.

When I almost made a serious mistake, getting engaged to a sociopath at 20, she was quick to assure me that she didn't need to be a grandmother. Fortunately that ended before any permanent damage was done (even the PTSD got better in time; the nightmares ended only 22 years after the breakup).

At 22 I decided to take no chances whatsoever and have a tubal ligation. When I told Mom, she was a little sad and then supportive. I told her not to give up, I might marry a man with kids. And I did. He has one child. Mom got to be part time low-key grandma for four years before my stepdaughter moved out of state and cut off contact. Everyone blamed us for that fiasco, including the two people who literally caused it. Everyone but my mom.

Really, the closest she came to being a grandma was with our cats and dogs. She loved ""grandpets"". Especially baby ones. If there was a kitten in the house we might get two visits a month. No bags of toys, no special treats, no costumes, no complaints about how we're caring for them--just hanging out holding a sleeping kitten or watching a bouncing one, or tossing a ball for a puppy.

JUSTNOMIL,ffc51ih,t3_es5auq,1579791692.0,"Why are so many of these women nurses? I wonder about them when I meet them irl (my sister's JNMIL, as well as several former friends) and I keep seeing it here, too. Maybe narcissists become nurses for the  joy of controlling sick people's lives and bodies. Whatever it is, when they aren't getting their way, power and control absolutely outweigh medical knowledge and common good sense. I'm glad these stories are so far in the past and you and the kids all survived to escape. This would be truly terrifying if it wasn't prefaced with ""daughter is 32 now and doesn't blame me"".

JUSTNOMIL,ffa881d,t3_eklp27,1579729790.0,"Hi, just joining your story in progress. It sounds like your MIL is the reincarnation of the one I fortunately dodged. (Except she had two sons so my SO just got the hate and abuse, not the obsession and financial aid.)

In case no one else said so, opening her letters to him is a good idea. Maybe it's technically a federal offence, but you're married and on his side. :) You don't even have to read it, just give it a glance to make sure she still hates you and then put it in the file for the legal action that's almost certainly somewhere in your future. That letter is your golden ticket if she ever says the words ""grandparents' rights"".

You're not hiding it from DH, you're doing what he asked: protecting him from her vitriol. He trusts you to tell him if there's information he needs, like an apology or an agreement on the house. Let him know he can trust you to keep the stuff he doesn't need at a distance for now. It took me 15 years of marriage to learn that. I give it to you for free."

My DH got a hateful mom, too. At least to him. His brother is the GC. The only way I've found to be supportive is to just--be supportive whenever it comes up. I haven't been where you are, my MIL died before I met DH, so my role has been loving him and helping him process his grief and anger over never having had a proper mother. Your DH is probably starting to feel some of that, along with the painful hope that she'll come around. All you can really do is encourage him to talk and listen to what he needs."

Treating you as anything less than fully equal in her celebration of your engagement (e.g. any hesitation over your family and/or members of the wedding party), especially after her son reminded her, is a JNMIL red flag.

""His"" cat is on the counter, staring down at my XJNSO's favorite glass, which is shattered all over the floor. XJNSO immediately starts screaming about ""my"" cat breaking his glass and goes to grab him off the chair. I point out that ""his"" cat is the one at the scene of the crime, and also is the one who was always on the counters.

Now I'm confined to a wheelchair and pants are a huge hassle (I legit don't know how that even works) so I'm all about dresses that go on over my head. I have almost a dozen, all plain black cotton, along with some black skirts (super stretchy to also go over my head) to wear with tank tops and tees. It's not at all fashionable, I use jewelry and shoes to dress it up when necessary, but it's practical af. And all my childhood problems are solved--can't fall, no one can pull my clothes off, and my wheelchair seatbelt holds skirts down in all but the stiffest breeze (then I rest my hand, or purse, in my lap).

Your parents ideally shouldn't stay with you. They should have visiting hours in your home, and if you want to go out that's up to you to decide and let them know. But no overnight stays, and don't give them keys! If you have an extra key hidden outside, bring it in.

If they have to stay with you, if that also triggers nuclear war, locking your bedroom door is a good idea. Other than that, all you can do is stay strong and refuse to do anything that you know is wrong for you and your child. If it means they yell, they yell. They can either stop yelling or leave. If it means they threaten to leave, let them leave. If they blame your DH for being white or controlling you, tell them it's a unanimous decision and they can respect it or leave.

Grandma needs to get her shit together before she sees your kids with or without either you.

JUSTNOMIL,feto29a,t3_eqk24d,1579377451.0,"Edited to Change Completely (Original Comment Below): I'm so sorry for what's happened to you and what's continuing to happen right now. And I'm sorry for everything I wrote before. I just accessed your deleted post and am still shaking, although the nausea has subsided. Milly, sweetheart, I'm so sorry, but you can't have a relationship with your mother. She is a deeply sick woman and the only way for you to live in the same world is for you to join her in her sickness. You've lived there most of your life and now you're getting out. Keep going. 

Since you're just figuring these things out right now, here's a little insight from one who also had a bad epiphany and survived:

You're right in that you're mom is emotionally 16. She's 16 and she's had a lot of husbands but she's had the same boyfriend all her life. She knows it's completely fucked, but if she faced that she'd have to go through what you're going through now. The big difference is she's older with so much more to regret, including admitting that she failed her children in the most profound way any parent can, and nothing to look forward to except the swiftly approaching death of said boyfriend. You have every reason to upend your life and get healthy while she has no reason to break her delusion.

I think she does love you, but look at what she thinks love is. Look at how her dad loves her. She doesn't know how to be a parent or love a child. It's amazing that you're making so much progress. But now you have to accept that she will never be able to protect you. She couldn't when you were little and she can't now because she hasn't grown. She's still 16, just like she was then. She's still not an adult. She hasn't learned boundaries--she barely understands the basics of what normal sexual boundaries even are--and she won't suddenly learn now. Staying in contact will mean remaining a passive partner in her sex life. (I know that's a horrifying thing to contemplate. Do talk to your therapist about it.)

And, of course, you will have to expect her to continue to force contact between you and your JNGF. Without your complicity in her delusion that everything is fine and her life is normal, she can't maintain the charade. This is her sickness. You can't cure her, you can only choose to cure yourself. You're already well on the way to doing that. Probably the easiest thing for you, and the kindest for both of you, is to gradually reduce contact until you're just not in each other's lives anymore. Avoid any situation where JNGF might be--that's not fair, I know, you're going to miss some cool stuff--and let her explain it however she wants. It sounds like most of the family will be able to figure it out. If she wants to talk about why you're suddenly not texting her back, go ahead and tell her. Keep it as simple and short and emotionless as possible. If she argues, block her number. Odds are, since she's already chosen, and she knows that she's both morally and criminally wrong, she'll let you go rather than make a big thing and keep the family all stirred up about it. Again, I'm very sorry.

Original Comment Below:

Since she hasn't specifically said anything about SO being in control of your response to this particular incident, and given the particular type of incident, I'd be inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt on this one. At least without more information.

Absolutely agree with other commenters that she's going to assume someone besides you is taking over the control she's losing. But since this is such a delicate subject (parents + porn + mom's already irrational about all female bodies) and you explained so perfectly and pointedly why she shouldn't be talking to you about it, she may just be embarrassed. For telling you or for being called out on it, or both. I've certainly made the mistake more than once of confiding something to the wrong person in the heat of the moment and the only thing you can really do afterwards is avoid them until you feel comfortable pretending it didn't happen. On a blunder this big that might as long as two weeks.

Personally I'd give her two more days, one at least, then text a casual hi, how are you? Just act like you talked to her yesterday and that the last exchange didn't happen. Unless she makes it a big gross habit, least said, soonest mended."

Fair is not a factor. Fair would have been for him to have good parents. Fair would be for his parents to feed his siblings. The people you live with and who support you emotionally and financially are the people you're going to see the most, and that's your parents. Because they're your parents. Them being the baby's grandparents doesn't actually enter into it. Nor is the baby the only reason your parents care about you, unlike her. That, btw, is not fair either.

Your MIL should not have a day with the baby. Not per week or per month or ever. She not a good mother or a good person. She will spoil him while he's a baby and reject him as soon as he displays personality traits that she doesn't approve of, just as she did to her own children. Your BF is a traumatized wreck. Give her a few years and your son will be, too. He'll also hear everything she hates about you, direct from Grandma's lips.

You need to keep your LO away from her as much as possible, for everyone's sake. It should be easy because BF shouldn't be living with or spending a lot of time around her. He needs  to understand that she isn't going to change, she isn't capable of loving him like a parent, and she will never stop trying to damage your relationship. 

Would it be possible for him to move in with your family until you can get a place of your own? Then tell her that you want the four of you--you, BF, MIL, and FIL--to go to a therapy session together and talk some things out. After he moves out, not before. He needs to be firmly on board and free of her control. If she refuses, tell her that you aren't comfortable seeing her or having her around the baby until it happens, and then block her number. Make sure BF's therapist knows what's going on and is available to fully support him during the worst of it.

Please don't let your son get a attached to a violent, abusive grandmother whom you already know you can't trust.
