Cringetopia,fguu6q6,t1_fgutdbk,1581129522.0,"on those weekly meetings with the form teacher (if this is what they’re called in English) in middle school I’d have to listen to how gay people are a disgrace to society apparently and how I shouldn’t wear certain types of clothing or touch my hair in public in a certain way since then it’d be my fault, were I sexually assaulted. Generally it’d be my fault. But then especially. Really loved those values I was taught.

Creationism was a thing, too.

Harry Potter is satanic, as well, apparently. They called a meeting with parents about that once. 

Long story short, it was pretty traumatic and a lot of people from that school ended up having similar views later in life. Don’t recommend."

niceguys,fgkctqn,t3_eyoxfh,1580862585.0,Oof. The good thing about this subreddit is that every experience of this sort can at least be met with some compensation in upvotes & karma.

AnorexiaNervosa,fdxmyk2,t3_en61oj,1578770783.0,"I think there are many people yet without or just without EDs who glorify EDs and are not fully aware of what they entail. Things like, obviously, having a very low BMI, “fragility”, extra attention for being scarily thin, finally accepting one’s body, are the desirable things. Being potentially hospitalised, tube fed, almost dying, fainting, being constipated 24/7, worrying your family and friends, etc., well, not so much."

UCL,fdv8g2q,t3_en649z,1578744573.0,"Once you’ve met the entry requirements and take the application process seriously, the odds are in your favour. UCL isn’t as competitive as Oxbridge and probably won’t even bother interviewing you. Write a good personal statement, and if you haven’t taken your exams yet - reasonably, the better your grades, the better chance of admission. To make your PS stand out, try to engage in something (more official than not) which shows your interest in the subject area connected to your degree and lowkey brag about it. To further increase your chances, your PS should be written to address one degree of your choice, only. In case you’re planning to apply to different unis through UCAS, too. A lot of my friends wrote half-assed PSs general enough as to apply for different degrees and it did them no good despite brilliant predicted grades. My PS was focused and thorough; I’m a first year NatSci undergrad at UCL now. Good luck!"
