braincancer,fgrn5pq,t3_f03w1s,1581051270.0,"My dad says his worst side effect is that Keppra has completely killed his sense of taste. He sleeps a good 13hrs a day too, but he’s also doing radiation and chemo atm. 

I don’t know too much about it but maybe there’s a way to even taper back a bit? Could alleviate some of that."
Wavyhair,fgq0psh,t1_fgpeyj6,1581015659.0,I’ll look for that. Thanks a bunch!
bulletjournal,fgpaw0t,t3_eznkat,1581000987.0,Ahhhhh! I love this so much! Cephalopods is my favvvv
Wavyhair,fgp9sbn,t1_fgod5zn,1581000277.0,I do put my hair in the bowl! How do you diffuse without doing that?
Wavyhair,fgp9qqb,t1_fgowy8k,1581000248.0,What gel is that?
Wavyhair,fgp9pm2,t1_fgp1slt,1581000227.0,Maybe so. I try not to. I do flip it side to side after some time to side with volume but maybe that’s making things worse. I’ll have to pay attention.
Wavyhair,fgp9l3k,t1_fgo6ebc,1581000146.0,This is the second or third reference to Aussie. Sounds like their products are good for wavies!
Wavyhair,fgp9hyl,t1_fgo65dm,1581000091.0,Sounds like foam is maybe the way to go
Wavyhair,fgp9d9j,t1_fgoe74l,1581000007.0,Thanks! I’ll give it a shot!
Wavyhair,fgp9ag7,t1_fgnrmhe,1580999957.0,Good to know thank you. I did something similar to this this morning as part of a refresh. We’ll see how it looks midday haha.
Wavyhair,fgp967m,t1_fgolykz,1580999881.0,I did actually try a gelatin treatment and also used a gel with hydrolized silk. My hair felt stiff and stringy and sticky. It was AWFUL. I think I’m far more moisture deficient. A deep condition made it feel so much better.
Wavyhair,fgp92g5,t1_fgnuk9q,1580999813.0,Isn’t it crazy the lengths we go to to embrace our wild locks?  Thanks for the info. I’ll see what I can incorporate into my routine :)
Wavyhair,fgp8whm,t1_fgp1q0q,1580999704.0,I’ve always liked Aussie. Their 3 minute miracle has worked wonders as a deep conditioner for my hair so maybe I’ll try this. I remember scrunching with Aussie mousse back in the day (before people started SOTC! oh 90s....)
Wavyhair,fgnvh16,t1_fgnrl1i,1580953785.0,I already diffuse :/
Wavyhair,fgnrile,t1_fgnqji1,1580951300.0,"Ugh I’m having pretty much the same issue. Super limp hair after half a day.  I’m guessing I must have high porosity hair too. I did a few deep conditioning treatments in a row and that seemed to help my hair feel softer but nothing helps the frizz. 
It always looks so nice and promising right after the shower"
Wavyhair,fgnndbi,t1_fgnn3bh,1580948647.0,Jeeze. I figured after 4 gels that contain something like “Max hold!” I’d have found SOMETHING.
Wavyhair,fgnna91,t1_fgnmzm5,1580948592.0,"I’ve noticed I definitely have more hold. But it’s insanely fuzzy/frizzy and by the end of the day it falls. I don’t really know if I have high porosity hair or not. It takes 3-4hrs to fully air dry. If I wet plop it overnight in a T-shirt I’ll wake up the next morning and it’s still not only just damp, but, if I squeeze it water will come out. So I don’t know what that means."
CitiesSkylines,fgdqy8e,t1_fgdi4ea,1580685663.0,I was thinking that too!
bulletjournal,fgcsjol,t3_ext6ne,1580675881.0,This is beautifully minimalistic :) I dig it.
bullcity,fgcs574,t1_fgakaez,1580675798.0,"I know. That’s what I figured too, however most of the sites also assume you’re only filing in one state. And I tried to delete the “file federal” and it just didn’t seem to be an option for remainder of them. So frustrating. I’ll just hope my paper forms are alright :/ 

Thanks for the info!"
bullcity,fg8czr3,t1_fg8c21k,1580615900.0,"Mother trucker. Well, I thank you for the confirmation! At least I know I’m not doing something wrong or missing something key. I’ll be sure to make it neat and clear, lol."
konmari,fg6xpbu,t1_fg6rljg,1580579297.0,Omg I was the same way. The movie Toy Story didn’t help at all.

Fruitarian,ffs1edl,t3_eqe2qp,1580170778.0,This amuses me because the entire reason humans were able to evolve PAST apes was being able to eat fats and proteins in large quantities. The dense caloric value of these foods allowed us the biological energy to grow huge brains and maintain their function.
Showerthoughts,ffp4hgc,t3_euau5s,1580086018.0,Walking into the closest wall is an integral part of my ungraceful morning routine.
Wavyhair,ff94k7t,t1_fex18mh,1579704682.0,"See I’m thinking I should switch to that now. I just looked at what I had and it’s Shea M anti frizz max hold gel but it has hydrolized silk (which i learned recently is protein!) so now I’m wondering if I should switch to something that’s more moisturizing. 

I just washed the crap out of my hair with head and shoulders then deep conditioned and it feels A MILLION times better. But no matter how much of this gel I put in my curls are limp 2 hours later. I also find it doesn’t give a cast at all. Maybe I need LA looks or something."
konmari,ff7dy4n,t1_ff6yzig,1579647332.0,"For this reason I recommend the “doll” someone else did. I just knit one for our house. You can buy them online too. I don’t k ow what they’re actually called, but they’re all the convenience of wadding up a bag and tossing it somewhere with none of the ugly mess :)"
Wavyhair,ff3or2w,t1_ff33rir,1579545605.0,"I think I will. Shampoo, consist, and nothing else to see what happens."
Wavyhair,ff3oote,t1_ff2jakr,1579545566.0,Lol I can’t figure out which way though. It feels like straw but also sticky and gummy. My very deep roots are the only part that feels soft and nice. And I didn’t do anything to them except wash with shampoo :/
Wavyhair,ff3ojgl,t1_ff3d1qf,1579545475.0,I think I will. Argh. So many months of trying!
Wavyhair,ff2xd55,t1_ff2sjkb,1579527631.0,Perhaps it’s best to strip my hair of everything and start over? I might try a single lock of hair and see what happens with different approaches.
Wavyhair,ff23qxl,t1_ff22dri,1579492989.0,Yes I’m assuming you meant “rinse the protein” and I did as much as possible.
Wavyhair,ff1zr28,t1_few23is,1579490003.0,Tried that tonight. I ent very poorly. It feels stringy and gummy and awful. Everything I read said follow up protein with a deep condition. I feel like I need a sulphate scrub to get my hair back to normal. Maybe just moisture?
Wavyhair,ff1xl5k,t3_er6s9g,1579488481.0,Did a protein treatment earlier today followed by deep condition. My hair feels AWFUL. It’s gummy and stringy. Suggestions on where to go from here???
Wavyhair,fexwj79,t1_fewley9,1579437639.0,Thanks! I just washed my hair to clarify so i guess I’ll try to deep condition today to see if that helps. Will let y’all know the results.
Wavyhair,fexwbwb,t1_fewlz1y,1579437561.0,"Thanks. I have tried all these things except the denman brush. I’m afraid my hair will come out super stringy with it, then again if i do it super soaking wet it may recline afterwards. Thanks, I’ll try that!"
Wavyhair,few6oee,t1_few2y9m,1579406064.0,"I should probably visit Sally’s, period. I usually just pick things up at target. But if it’s worth the trip, I’ll definitely try it!"
Wavyhair,few6hgw,t1_few23is,1579405977.0,"Alright, I’ll dig in and try it for sure and see where it gets me!"
Wavyhair,few6cyy,t1_fevvw7d,1579405918.0,I’m really just starting the process of trying to figure out the right products in the right order with the right techniques. It’s overwhelming.
Wavyhair,fevvnji,t1_fevj525,1579401992.0,Thank you. :) I fought them for so long not realizing I was wavy.
Wavyhair,fevvdzs,t1_fevkjej,1579401944.0,I have not yet. :) I’m honestly not sure if my hair needs protein or moisture. I’ve heard their two sides of a coin. Any recommendations? I’m willing to give it all a shot.
Wavyhair,fevv4r6,t1_fevtk0m,1579401899.0,"I have but not a lot. I have a hard time spending so much on all these different products! I tried some stuff from twisted sistah. Some things have been CGM approved, some not. I get roughly the same result. I have a hard time determining if my hair needs moisture or protein. And I’m not sure if I should try a deep condition, as I’m afraid it’ll weigh it down and stretch everything out!"
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fevinxo,t3_eqi6yr,1579397855.0,The eyes remind me so much of the cat bus from My Neighbor Totoro.
Wavyhair,fev3bii,t1_fev2q09,1579392638.0,That’s what I had been doing for about 5 months before this. More of the same.  This actually came out slightly better and curlier.
Wavyhair,feuws49,t3_eqoe9y,1579390727.0,"Trying to figure out my waves. I seem to have a mix. Now, I know my hair is super damaged at the bottom from lightening and I also need a trim really badly. So that’s not helping anything. My waves seem to be looser up front and tighter underneath (you can see a few of the those in the last picture). I also get A LOT of frizz at my roots (you can see in the backlighting). Part of that is I’m afraid to put gel any closer to my scalp or my hair will look greasy? Also lots of whites coming in (I started going gray at 26, weird genetic thing). 

This is after sulfate/parabans free shampoo, silicon free conditioner, leave in conditioner, and Shea moisture anti frizz gel scrunched In after, plopped for ten minutes, diffused on low for 15-20ish minutes, Sotc. Any ideas on how to get waves more defined?

I don’t mine having kind of wild hair (I’m a Leo and don’t mind a mane!) but would like it to look like hair and not craziness!"
IkeaDelivery,fetmr9i,t1_fet05f2,1579376954.0,"Card company and tell them you’d like to dispute the charge for x, y and z reasons. I know with Chase they refunded me and IKEA had 30 or 60 days to respond and rectify. I ended up paying for everything but the headboard because they never sent one."
IkeaDelivery,fesv4ze,t3_eqitej,1579369314.0,"My headboard came damaged. I couldn’t even get the phone to connect on their customer service line. I issued a chargeback and ikea contacted me via my credit card company on the last possible day. 

Document all the calls you’ve made and any online forms. Then tell ikea If you call again, If no one is willing to resolve you’ll issue a dispute."

ketorecipes,fdyam2e,t1_fdy9ubm,1578777739.0,This comment deserves a lot more updoots. I snorted.
memes,fdo6nl5,t1_fdlynps,1578599817.0,"I had this happen to me as a child (30 now, was 4 at the time). Fiend had a mild case, mom brought me over to play with her. Got them too, lasted maybe a week then gone. Chicken pox vaccine was invented a couple years later in 1995. 

Because there was no vaccine it actually made a lot of sense to do this. Chicken pox as a child, from what I understand, is a million times more manageable/less painful than as an adult (my dad had it at 16 and still has the scars)."
bullcity,fdc4ak7,t1_fdc3yc4,1578266829.0,Honestly I feel like the sign needs to be more specific I guess. People probably see it and assume it flashes all the time no matter what. If it was like “YOUR vehicle is over height. Do not enter” maybe people would pay more attention to it? But also people are idiots and forget what they’re driving or have no spatial awareness.
