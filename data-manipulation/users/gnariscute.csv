depression,ff5go41,t1_ff5giu8,1579592049.0,I get baited every time by them.
depression,ff5g5zv,t3_err6on,1579591430.0,Call the police ASAP when you can. Unless this is a troll
depression,ff5fgzf,t3_err22y,1579590575.0,I’m so sorry for your loss.
depression,ff5fcb2,t3_erqyx4,1579590421.0,"This really hit home. I find it impossible to have people to stay once they get to know me. I don’t have trouble making friends, I have a terrible time keeping them for this reason. 

This won’t mean shit to you but if you ever wanted to talk to vent out your problems that you’re dealing with, feel free to give me a message. 

You sound like a person that WHEN you find your S/O you’re going to be extremely special to him/her. Hard for me to explain that correctly, but you seem set on life apart from the feeling alone part."
depression,ff5eogg,t3_erq62y,1579589651.0,Nope! Thanks for asking
depression,fep9zi0,t1_fep9b0m,1579315471.0,"Don’t think you’ll get downvoted for that. I didn’t mean being pale is like “less pale the better looking” because I don’t even believe that. Out of everything I wrote you commented on the pale thing. xd

I didn’t mean being pale is a bad thing. Odds are I’m just being hard on myself because of how pale I am. And nobody even gives a shit how much sun you get"
depression,fep89dx,t3_epzjky,1579314360.0,"So everything I want to be better for me, won’t even help IF I actually accomplished any of them? That’s great to know. Very demotivating. 

But I’m so glad you said something, now I don’t need to waste my time doing any of the things I said I wanted done for myself."
workout,fcmtyb5,t1_fcmtqri,1577792128.0,Yeah I meant therapist. I don’t even go to the yearly checkups at doctor doctors because of anxiety. I’m going to give your last suggestion a read on the web. Thanks for your help
depression,fcjol7i,t1_fcjoc5p,1577696790.0,"I don’t know anyone except my moms side of the family. We blocked off my dads side due to issues between us and them. If anyone else knew how to show it, that would be great. I’m not suicidal, not until mom passes away, which I hope isn’t for a long time. 

Sorry for being so negative. Having an extremely bad time with depression right now. Thanks again"
depression,fcjo1n1,t1_fcjnpuj,1577696015.0,"“When you can get help” explain as to where I get my life on track kind of help? If you knew me, you’d see that there’s nothing great about me. I know you’re trying to get me to feel better, and I appreciate that, I really do, but my life is on a complete stop, and has been for 8 years. I do want to get better, don’t get me wrong, but I’m literally starting from scratch WITH NO education on what I should even be doing."
depression,fcjhxb7,t1_fcj29ar,1577688252.0,"My goals in life;
Overcome my anxiety

Get fit to the point where I feel good about the way I look. (Right now I’m underweight for my age)

Make money but only to the point where I can make my SO and future family (fingers crossed) happy. As long as we don’t have money problems and we can get what we want (at a reasonable price). 

Drive

Work on hygiene (this one I can start any time without trouble). But getting 1 of these previously listed goals done and that’s it isn’t a big enough motivating cause to do so. 

I get exhausted from the littlest tasks, I want that to change. 

There’s more but can’t think of any. Just imagine a 26 year old that does nothing all day, and literally only goes outside when I have a therapist appointment. I have a really boring life."
Anxiety,fcdbend,t3_eh29dj,1577608462.0,Why is this so spot on to me and my situation
depression,fcaj9wb,t1_fcaick9,1577570249.0,"I feel like you nailed it. Even people said, “what if you guys got together and find out how much you hate it. Like this whole obsession thing is just a waste of energy and you’re weeping on something not to be sad about.” And I tell them, well at least there would of been an attempt to make things work together. It wouldn’t be so hard to forget about her, well get over her, if there was at least something at one time. And that’s what I want so bad. 

I don’t let her know how depressed I get over not being able to get with her, because I don’t want anything to feel forced. I want her to want to make things work with me. Not because she’d feel bad about it, but because she wants to."
depression,fcai821,t1_fcai0j4,1577569683.0,Would love to if I could
depression,fc53gfl,t3_efyc5z,1577441168.0,"A crush that doesn’t want anything to do with me, yes. I’m desperately trying to reconnect with someone who makes me feel like shit 90% of the time. I’m a whole lot of fucked up."
depression,fc52axn,t1_fc51gqc,1577439431.0,"I wish person I’m talking about wrote me. I don’t even think they think about me let alone write to me. I have to be the one to start a message, and even then 9/10 times they’d ignore me anyways. 

When they do give me attention, it’s the best feeling ever, it’s just not very common in the slightest."
depression,fandz34,t3_ea2b5r,1576236572.0,"I only ran into one asshole on this sub so far. Asshole said “you realize you’re doing this all for attention right, just kys already” Good times

Not word for word but that was the jist of it all"
