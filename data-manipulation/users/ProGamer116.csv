papermario,ffdyro4,t3_esy61h,1579832282.0,"I feel a very similar way about most of the things he said, but nonetheless would like to give a few of my suggestions for a new game.  While I doubt that Nintendo would do most of these things, I do feel that they would improve the quality of a new Paper Mario game in a traditional style:  


1.  Go back to the original concept of Mario Story.  

This is probably the most controversial of my suggestions, but I believe it is one of the best.  In the original game (and for the most part, the sequel too) the “Paper” part was *JUST* an art style, and I would recommend going back to it just being a light artistic stylization.  Doing so would prevent the pitfall that the previous two games fell into of solely being “Hey, look!  It’s Paper!” and would allow us to have another *epic* adventure, and not another cheesy one.  


2.  Designed with the longtime fans in mind.  

One of my biggest criticisms of TTYD was that it was ridiculously easy.  There are several key factors why, but what I believe was the biggest contributor to the problem were the infinite amount of (most) badges.  While good in theory, you end up with players equipping 22 Power-Rushes and killing the final boss with one power bounce.  Set amounts of badges, like in 64, seems like the way to go.  

The 99 max level in TTYD also was a huge problem too.  Since badges are the main source of your power and abilities (as they should be,) having such large amounts of BP meant that you could, for all intents and purposes, equip any and all badge you wanted to use.  Pair that with the stupidly low stats of enemies and you’ve just eliminated most of the strategy from the game.  

If I was in charge of the development of the game, I would have a “Veteran” mode option you could choose upon the creation of a new save file.  While the normal mode would be classic Nintendo (kind of hand-holdy and basic) and designed for new players and young kids, the “Veteran” mode would be designed for Paper Mario’s large audience of older Gamers (teens and adults) and longtime fans.  It would pretty much do exactly what Master Quest did to 64; raise the difficulty by buffing enemy stats, changing enemy formations, improved AI, and add additional mechanics.  


3.  Make it a darker and more mature game.

Unlikely for today’s Nintendo, but I would love to see a darker and more mature Paper Mario game.  Remember in TTYD when you learned about how Bobbery blamed himself for his wife’s death?  Yeah, that was good writing.  I would like more stuff like that.  ...Okay, maybe a little brighter than that, but you get the point.

Now, of course I’m not suggesting taking away all of the humor, silliness, absurdity, and wackiness, I want plenty of all that.  I want the game’s story to take itself seriously, but not *too* seriously, like the first 3.  


4.  Don’t do another “Oh no!  Bowser stole the thing!”  

It was fine in the 64 because it was the first game in the series, but I really hope they don’t do “Bowser stole the thing” for a fourth time.  It’s not as bad if they do another “Collect the X number of X things to save the day” since, I imagine, it is pretty difficult to come up with an alternative for a Chapter by Chapter structured story that’s actually good.  

While I don’t really care too much if Bowser serves as the comedic C plotline (like in TTYD), or the main antagonist of the story, I *DO* care about how he is written depending on his role.  
If he’s a comic relief character, he should be written as a funny, thick-skulled goofball who’s always getting himself into trouble, just as he was in TTYD.  On the other hand, a main antagonist Bowser needs to be a clever, threatening force not to be messed with, that still gets some laughs out of you.  


5.  Unique partners in and out of battle.

A problem with the partners we have had in the past is that they are too similar.  TTYD did partners better, for the most part, (Partners being able to take most damage for you was ridiculously OP,) since your active partner got to talk **much** more often, allowing each of Mario’s companions to shine with their personalities.  Unfortunately however, not all partners shine in battle.  Too many moves and partners try to fill the same niche, with some just being better at it.  

Each partner should fit into different archetypes with their own strengths and weaknesses that are useful for certain types of situations.  Maybe a Chomp partner could be a tank that does high damage and doesn’t get hurt when attacking spiky and flame enemies, but is only able to hit front-row grounded enemies.  A trickster Shy Guy that hits for low damage but inflicts most enemies with a status perhaps?  A tactical Goomba (the traditional tattler) that focuses less on attacking and more on buffing and aiding Mario could work.

You can take inspiration from past partners too, like Bow and Watt.  Bow’s archetype is a fast and evasive partner with the highest potential single target damage (in one turn) and can help Mario doge powerful attacks, but can’t hurt enemies with defense.  Watt, on the other hand, has an almost complete opposite archetype.  She only has one attack and doesn’t do too much damage, but she really *shines* against low HP high defense opponents with her piercing damage.  


**BONUS.**  Small suggestions that are too small for their own segment:  

a.  Add Kammy Koopa back.  

b.  Hold B to automatically skip through text.  

c.  Make all tutorials optional.  

d.  Items should be balanced.  

e.  Have Power Bounce return and be strong but not *too* strong (essentially 64 Power Bounce mechanics.)



**P.S.**  
I originally wanted to have a sixth point about world design but ran out of time, so I’ll sum it up quickly:  
6.1:  Open areas; areas aren’t linear paths.
6.2:  Connected world; travel to places through actual paths, not just pipes like in TTYD.  
6.3:  More than just the generic fields, desert, mountains, snowy, etc.  
6.4:  Very little to no backtracking."

AskReddit,fd4ovk4,t3_ejwjbm,1578169538.0,"“Gaining the ability to stop time” is not as straightforward as it seems and requires several questions to be answered for what action to take next.  

1.  Do you stop aging?    
This is the least important question in this list but is still important.  Whether or not you age while time is paused greatly determines how long you’d (or I’d) use it.  If you do age, every second you spend paused subtracts a second from how far in time you’ll live in the “real” world.  Using it everyday for several minutes adds up *quickly.*    

2.  How does kinetic energy work?    
If time is paused, then if you move, your speed and acceleration is effectively infinite, and since F = M * A, your force would equal infinite.  With infinite force, moving even the slightest could theoretically destroy the universe.  You might not even be able to move though; moving requires you to push air out of the way, so moving in this stopped reality requires you to move air even though it is frozen in time.    

3.  How does gravity work?    
Gravity requires time to be applied, so taking a single step would theoretically make you start floating upwards into the sky.    

4.  How does light work?    
You know the “the problem with being faster than light is that you can only live in darkness” meme?  
Essentially that.  Since light would be frozen too, you’d have to walk forward in order for you to see.  You’d also leave a trail of darkness behind you since light can’t move to fill that space.    

There are likely many more problems that I just can’t think of right now.  If we just say that it’s magic and that I don’t age, I’d probably abuse the heck out of it for good and for my personal benefit.    

I’d do things like:    

1.  Join the military and obliterate all our enemies.    
2.  Give myself all the time I need to think, de-stress, and rest.    
3.  Eliminate all time pressures for writing, any future tests, etc.
