DesignPorn,fff6a9m,t3_etat3h,1579876795.0,It's convinient but I wish the material was more waterproof when you're adding the liquid. If you're not the Flash making an oatmeal serving it will turn into a soggy mess.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fff5vg5,t1_fff4ec2,1579876495.0,I've always wondered how that works. Interesting TFS.
ADHD,fff5orr,t1_fff5ho7,1579876357.0,Thanks! Good luck!
ADHD,fff5eg3,t3_etb0az,1579876144.0,"I struggle with this too. Even in commenting online and I always have this exposed feeling of instant regret. If I catch myself doing it, I try to switch to asking questions and learning about the other person. In school you could probably ask about teachers they liked or didn't like, what they want career wise etc. With people you already know, pick something you want to talk about and start by asking their opinions."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffbh255,t3_esoywi,1579764961.0,I had to lookup what a nudibranch was. Commonly known as sea slugs. I had no idea that there were so many different kinds!
ADHD,ff9nvqz,t1_ff9kbq3,1579716919.0,"Your dad sounds like my father in law. I married into a ""mental illness isn't a thing"" culture. My brother has ADHD, hyperactive type and was diagnosed as a kid. Because I'm female and also was a high academic achiever, I slid under the radar. It's only now, when I have my own kids with ADHD that I've been able to see it in myself. Life used to be debilitating for me and I didn't understand why no matter what I tried I just couldn't ""get my shit together"".
Finding a good mental health specialist was life changing, I encourage you to seek out someone in your area who specializes in ADHD. Good Luck, friend."
ADHD,ff9lc8a,t3_eseyzu,1579715417.0,I didn't know this was an ADHD thing. I've wondered why coffee doesn't seem to affect me like my family. Interesting.
ADHD,ff9judm,t3_esf13e,1579714536.0,"Find a better doctor. A psychiatrist might be more empathetic and also able to prescribe something.

ADHD,ff5ocew,t3_ersp0z,1579603071.0,"Good job on taking the first step and talking to a therapist. That should shed some light and hopefully give you some validation.
As for punctuality, ADHDers tend to GROSSLY underestimate the time it takes to do things. This is one of my biggest struggles. I've found it easier in the past year or so to overestimate my commute and focus on the time I need to leave the house by, and not the time I need to be there.  I've been punctual around 90% of the time since. Another thought is having a book you love or a game on your phone you enjoy playing and looking forward to arriving early to have a few extra minutes to indulge. I hate waiting for things to happen so I think that's a part of why I avoid being early, but if I'm looking forward to something, it's not so awful. I hope you keep your job. You sound great at it."

As with all prophets in Islam, they are human, and worshipping or idolizing them is the ultimate sin, as monotheism is the basis of the religion."
