Im noticing a pattern between the constitution and bible. They worship something theyve never read, only heard about. In doing this, you can envoke the name of either to justify whatever stupid shit you want to do or say."

I was raised in a trailer and went to a public school in Kentucky. There is no excuse nor - reason to be stupid. This person is on the intenet...this means they have limitless knowledge at their fingertips - for free.

Spending their time looking up twerking videos is on them, not me.

Maybe they're typing on their phone, as I am. Maybe they dont give a fuck, as I often don't. But don't let people get away with being stupid and blame others. At a certain point it's personal accountability. Progressively so if they have access to the internet."

No! This is bullshit. Things arnt better because I weigh 200lbs less!

Then, fast forward a few years and their health has improved - loud fat people show up, pointing in their face, saying that you can be healthy at any size! The fat people shame the owners into firing them and giving their jobs to the new fat people...
