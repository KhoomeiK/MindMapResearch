patientgamers,fdl4upa,t1_fdl3v1j,1578517069.0,"What helps me with these games is immersing myself in it. When I play I'm not sitting at my desk clicking buttons, I try to put myself in the game as the character I'm playing and get into that mind set. Playing DnD helped a lot with this but I've always done it to an extent while playing games. When you create a character try making a back story for them and give them personality traits. The character I made in Pillars is a Nature Godlike who comes from the Living lands. Lived alone as an outcast most of his life due to being an unusual race and not liking the constant attention (both good and bad). He's a rogue due to his history of not wanting attention so he got used to sneaking around in and out of places he needed to go. After a close brush with death he decided its time to stop hiding and accept who he is and try to build a life worth living hence why he is traveling to a far land for a chance to start over at the beginning of the game. So when a decision needs to be made I don't think what will provide the best result I think what would an outcast who is trying to turn his life around do? It keeps it interesting because non ideal choices tend to provide different challenges and keeps the game fresh and interesting. At least for me. But this all stems from trying to scratch that DnD itch so it may not work for you"
