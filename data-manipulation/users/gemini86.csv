PLC,ffgpevu,t1_ffg3kiu,1579911709.0,I think that we're starting to see that wallstreet gamblers aren't the best metric to something's worth. They routinely make companies make very very bad decisions and aren't great for the people as a whole. But yeah I get that you're saying.

mazda3,ffazxzo,t1_ffaty79,1579748401.0,Lol even on coal electrics get better equivalent mileage than any ice could dream of. And the battery production is no worse that building ice cars. I'm a gear great myself but there's just a time to look at the overwhelming stack of facts that show us that electrification is the way forward.

ProgrammerHumor,fe666ee,t1_fe5vio7,1578882675.0,My gripe with 365 is that they just change shit with no notice or documentation. They move buttons to other screens or remove functions all together. It's so hard to get used to a work flow and then it just gets broken randomly. Stopped using it.

mazda3,fdn2tif,t1_fdlrjwh,1578575609.0,Sure it's heavier but the 3 is more planted than it feels. It takes a lot to get it to understeer and obviously never oversteers (well unless you really really try). I have a gen 1 hb in black with a 2.5 swap.
