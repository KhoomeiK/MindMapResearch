Nope. Did you actually read what you linked? That section of the law actually reduced the rights of the monarch. Read part 4. Before, all marriages by anyone descended from King George II (likely thousands of people, at this point) had to be aprroved by the monarch. Now, only marriages by the first six people in the line of succession have to be approved by the monarch."

If you try to decrypt the drive directly (bypassing the SEP), you have to brute force an entire key (which is a 256 bit string) rather than a PIN. Using all the computing power available to humanity put together, that would take multiple times the age of the universe to break. Good luck with that..."
