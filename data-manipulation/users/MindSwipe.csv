True

>You're buying directly from Sony / Microsoft. There is no middle man shop that also needs to make a profit

There is a middle man, it's Sony on PS and Microsoft on XBOX. Say I buy Titanfall 2, a game developed by Respawn, and pay 10$ for it, Sony will (generally) take 30% or 3$ dollars, meaning Respawn only gets 7$. Sony and Microsoft alongside every other company need to make a profit

>I can't lend the game to my friends

This is true, but a huge plus to Sony, instead of lending your 60$ game to a friend, your friend needs to pay the 60$, off which Sony makes money

Conpared to the KV1, it's armor is thinner in some parts (the KV1 has 75mm on the front turret and hull) and it's gun was conparable.
