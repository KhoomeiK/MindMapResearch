NewTubers,ffmgujc,t3_eu1wj9,1580054480.0,"Took me a year, exactly a year, to get my first 100 subs as an indie gaming channel. Although, I did not use any tags etc.

I reached 1000+ subs after approximately 4 years, but only started looking into every aspect the last year. Tags, descriptions, schedule... it all matters, something I took no notice of at first.

I started a second channel by now, where I do focus on all of this, and see a much bigger growth compared to my main channel, it being at 175 subs right now. It is a different subject though, but still, the knowledge I now have does help a lot."

I have a blood disorder they never got a name for, meaning I have no right for any financial compensation. Which is cool, as the disorder prevents me from working.
I'm at the age that friends start their own family and move in together, where I am stuck at home, being dependent on my mother.
I see no future as the past 8 years this has been going on, I only lost things and people.
So yeah.. taking my own life seems like the only way out of this bullshit."

Two years later, we properly met as our group of friends 'combined' so to speak, and that friendship kind of grew to the point it is at now.
Still not a part of his family though."
AskReddit,ff3weg0,t3_eriiu0,1579550312.0,"I gained a lot of weight due to a medical condition and its medication I had to take at one point in life (25 kg in 6 weeks time). My body was swollen, rock hard and stretch marks cover my body.
When I quit the medication and the swelling and weight went down a bit, I promised myself never to get to that point again.

From that day, I started drinking water only, eat a lot of fruit and count my calories, as exercise is near impossible due to the medical condition. 
I've been balancing between 78 - 82 kg for 7 years now."

There's also the street starter sets, but they'll cost you quite a lot as they're not as common.
