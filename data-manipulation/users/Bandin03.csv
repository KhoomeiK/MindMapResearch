Kinda like how your body feels when you have a bad cold but you also feel like you weigh three times heavier. Then to top it off, despite being a sleep aid, it's almost impossible to fall asleep and sleep it off. It was just several hours of hell.

Even in the normal dosage ranges, if you stay up too long, you start to get that bad body feeling and strobe effects and it gets kinda hard to fall asleep. Just stick to the usual hallucinogens if you wanna trip."
