Dream,ffa4vrn,t3_eqggyp,1579727932.0,"Dreams are a way of thought-processing, which has the sort of cool side-effect of telling you what you think about most, in a sort of poetic way. In your case, your first guess was probably right. You are likely conciously or subconciously afraid of your child getting sick/into trouble. It seems that you worry about constantly having to keep an eye on her due to possible dangers lurking around the corner (another rat appearing when you're disposing of the last one). This, of course, is completely normal for someone with a young child. As for what your mother said in the dream, it could be that you actively worry about your child but don't want to seem like you're overly protective or obsessive. Either that, or it is random information being processed due to a different occurrence in your life. A secret perhaps, or being ashamed of something."

Edit: I did it for you guys: Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), **or gender identity**. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys /men and girls/women. those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the ""hijras"" of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc)."
