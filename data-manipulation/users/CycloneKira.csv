Sure, they go out for the occasional dinner or party when they're invited, but the rest of the time, it's as if there's nothing to do other than work. Which I know is bullshit because they actually have free time here and there to do things with their friends, but they choose to spend that time watching stuff or (surprise, surprise) railing on me or my brother for whatever reason that pops into their heads.

Frankly, listening to them judging their friends the way they do is a pretty good indicator of why their social lives aren't all that active, if that makes any sense."
