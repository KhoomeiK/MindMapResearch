nfl,ff1pgvf,t1_fewc19e,1579483265.0,"If Peyton and Roethlisberger both had 3 rings, that'd put them in a lot larger group (5 people with 3+ rings) and so would not be compared nearly as hard. Especially because Peyton would be 3-2 and Roethlisberger would be 3-1, both of which are gonna be viewed significantly different from 6-3. Obviously that could go higher, but at the same time they could have more Super Bowl losses as well. It'd be a lot closer to John Elway (2-3), Roger Staubach (2-2) and so on than what we get with Brady (6-3) or for example Montana (4-0)."
nfl,fevf5a1,t1_feu8i4y,1579396673.0,"Missed his point. He was pointing out that lots of HoF, great QBs have Super Bowl/playoff stats like Rodgers, Brady winning so damn many skews perception on what a QB ""should"" win, plus I could definitely see Manning/Roethlisberger losing some Brady won, or maybe they split and it becomes much less intense, etc"
nfl,fepq0cz,t1_fepoyjc,1579327449.0,Just Ndamukong Suh in general.
nfl,fdcnyd0,t1_fdc0j13,1578279635.0,Fuck MLMs.

nfl,fdcml9r,t1_fdcf5b3,1578278653.0,"Was essentially hired as a coach rather than to play. Dude was legit doing high school QB coaching when signed.

As for why they didn't sign an extra QB given Wentz having an injury issue..."
nfl,fdcm2i5,t1_fdc5z1f,1578278281.0,"Turns out defense is still important, guys!"
fantasyfootball,fd5uuyl,t1_fczozk0,1578181784.0,I would say that returned value. It's a particularly high end RB2. I would say the key thing you want from a first round pick is to be at least a higher WR2/RB2 with a good chance at WR1/RB1.
nfl,fd56i3r,t3_ejz90p,1578174672.0,"TBH people are underrating Marvin in this thread, he wouldn't be a bad hire."
nfl,fczgl0l,t1_fcz5o51,1578100789.0,"He also just failed to understand how this kind of statistical regression works. It isn't like everyone regresses to the exact average, you would try to figure out the average of what they're doing based on plays etc and then consider regressing to that. It isn't like you just adjust a baseball player's stats all to average as if they were luck. He also doesn't adjust interceptions despite adjusting attempts and TDs which is really hilarious."
nfl,fct2dua,t1_fcs9h0r,1577931087.0,"For 2 million, in my fiscal situation? Every time."
nfl,fct1q8e,t1_fcpg0r2,1577930607.0,"He lost to New England by 3 points with Philip Rivers having a fucking torn ACL, how is that Marty's fault? Only had one losing season in his San Diego tenure and when he was fired had gone 12-4, 9-7 and 14-2. And it wasn't like the team was some juggernaut when he came in, either."
nfl,fcp8k69,t3_ei4c4e,1577854093.0,"He's still on a rookie deal, so not surprising to at least keep him around in 2020. Just get a good backup plan. Sign someone like Tyrod Taylor to be your backup, who should be inexpensive, and maybe draft a late round QB as essentially a lottery number."
nfl,fcp8dw4,t1_fcorlv9,1577853922.0,Firing Marty is still something I personally find one of the dumbest moves you'll see.
nfl,fcp6ozf,t1_fcp571z,1577852266.0,"Honestly, this just makes me wonder. If, in theory, the Patriots would be willing to trade Belichick, how many draft picks would one give up before it stopped being Worth?"
Showerthoughts,fcp2bnm,t1_fcp229k,1577848309.0,Maybe you aren't sounding believable enough.
todayilearned,fcoyt8z,t1_fcoxs9z,1577845359.0,"Yeah, he's mentioned it before. They also were going to change the name, then he demanded they change it back, because that was why he even took the movie up."
todayilearned,fcowvra,t1_fcod022,1577843792.0,"Reminder that a fair amount of the language theory in 1984 provided to be very, very untrue."
todayilearned,fcow78y,t1_fconvvj,1577843253.0,"Reminder that he decided to act in Snakes on a Plane solely because the name ""Snakes on a Plane"" was fucking hilarious. Absolute legend."
fantasyfootball,fcovq0t,t1_fcnm2gk,1577842877.0,"It makes sense. The easiest way to win a championship is to get strong production from guys at lower draft picks/waiver wire/etc. If you had DeVante Parker as your flex for free all year you got good production and hot in the playoffs to boot, for example."
nfl,fcm6irz,t1_fckzz41,1577765508.0,"I don't disagree with your opinion, but I would like to point out Gurley had also already had a really poor year in 2016, worse than this year even.

I definitely wouldn't pay Henry. He has a history of being underwhelming. Prime regression candidate."
fantasyfootball,fcj4f7g,t1_fci8akl,1577677012.0,"This just made me imagine real life making a pick -3 or -7 points because it's an anti-score and games start being decided, like, 7 to -14."
fantasyfootball,fcj3s4d,t1_fcc3e9k,1577676551.0,"Haskins wasn't even the starter and was labeled a project by his own team why would he even be included on this list, even if he was a 5th year he wouldn't be a smart pick in the draft."
nfl,fciwder,t1_fcis3p2,1577671400.0,"I remember 2010. I was wishing Randy Moss would sign with the team because Ochocinco, Terrell Owens and Randy Moss as your WR core is simultaneously the best and worst thing possible."
nfl,fcivoeu,t1_fciql42,1577670926.0,"Marvin Lewis wasn't why we lost most of the time in the first round. I still wish he was around, honestly."
politics,fbckzr5,t1_fbcdllz,1576726451.0,"I should note I'm a Democrat myself. I wanted them to drag it out longer and get more political gains out of it. Plus if they wanted people to actually flip, they did not do nearly enough politically to do so. Felt like they didn't really want to go full barrel into it when they should have."
