If you're talking about the various services that offer road side assistant and accident help, which are implemented on a per company basis and coast money. You're absolutely right. It's also very possible for you to monitor what information is sent out and check whether it's sending your location 24/7. These technologies aren't some crazy thing that people can't monitor and figure out on their own.

Do you have time to do that? Maybe not. But there's lot of engineers in the security industry who not only test this stuff for work, but just for fun and practice. Trying to crack, hack, and monitor their own devices to see what's possible. But hell, OnStar might do that, I've never owned a car with OnStar, haven't researched it personally.

Regardless, I was talking about a centralized database with this information, of all registered US vehicles. OnStar is on a very small small amount of vehicles. BMW has its own service. These things are segmented. Put them in one database and you have something much more valuable."

Futurology,ffggjo4,t1_ffgg3bv,1579905735.0,"Well I don't have an android so my phone doesn't automatically tell google anything. In android I believe you still have levels of control over what information is automatically sent. Should you trust google? No. But there are thousands of security researches around the world who would love to blow the story if if it happened. Same way we can be pretty secure in our knowledge that Amazon Echos actually send what they're supposed to send and only when they're supposed to.

But your phone has a GPS in it. If google wanted to do that they could know your exact location without caring about your WiFi network. Chances are, default settings on an android, do tell them this though. If you don't turn off location tracking on your google account, you can look at your location history for years going back if you used their apps/services. I know that for a fact.

Futurology,ffgd2wb,t1_ffg2tq3,1579903553.0,"That really wouldn't be required. If you design a device that plugs into the ODB-II port. If your car is less than 20 years old you have one.

Wouldn't even cost a lot to manufacture, I would put that together for ~10 bucks a unit. 

I think there's a lot of reasons NOT to do this, privacy being a bigger one. Know where ever car is at anytime is a HUGE attack vector for hackers, terrorists, or bad actors in the government. But the tech for putting something like this together isn't difficult or expensive.

bisexual,fenldg8,t1_fen8khf,1579287164.0,Did your sexuality not confuse you ever? I wouldn't make fun of them for that. Just their actions.
politics,femb726,t1_felbs9a,1579246874.0,When I was younger I was personally confused by the idea that Clinton was impeached but was still president. I was born in 88 so I remember his trial but didn't understand the details. The word impeachment is used in the vernacular to mean removed from office which is 100% wrong. Not sure where that started.
bisexual,femansm,t3_epvsxo,1579246208.0,"The idea that people can be bisexual is still scary for a lot of people. Could they be bi? Even straight people can generally tell if a member of the same sex is ""attractive"" without being sexually attracted to them. And I think that's confusing to them.

I'll also say, after watching the documentary that I think he was gay and this thread is a little much."

But honestly, I'm not gonna keep arguing with you about it. If you don't like the macbook pro don't get one (you weren't going to anyways), I just don't like people spreading disinformation."

The senate doesn't impeach. That's what they were correcting you on."

Never had a thermal problem, they're actually very thermally efficient. They also have 4 USB-C ports. Where did you learn about macbooks that made you such a knowledgeable authority? 

I see many points on many subjects repeated around the internet. Doesn't make them correct... If your knowledge of them comes from anti-mac circle jerks. That might be the issue."
