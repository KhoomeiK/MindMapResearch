AskReddit,ffeqeoo,t3_et7wh8,1579860321.0,"No.  Easier.  Much.  I’m 40 but have a teenage son who also feels like this is “the greatest time to be alive.”  He has instant access to the world of knowledge, he has instant access to creative outlets (in his case making beats, short films and photography) and he thinks in terms of “the world is a mixtape” so that of course now it’s the best time for all that - food, Art, people, culture.  

I “had” him young, via an early weird divorce, but we’re tight in a “bro way” and we talk all the time that even though I’m not quite “old” if I wanted to know what the capital of Australia was I needed to go to the library, look at the Dewey decimal system, find the book on a shelf, and look at the contents, and find the page.  He can ask Siri.  To make beats, I had to go to a studio that cost $1000 a day, make no mistakes, and hope it came out ok, maybe had access to a home tape machine later on, but not easy, not good quality, nor cheap) while he makes beats on FL or logic that could sell on streaming when done.  Photography: I had to use film and an analog lab with nasty chemicals, and wait for developments and prints, he gets instant access to his photos, cinematic video also.  

We talk a bit about social pressure and bullying, he doesn’t see it - he’s smart enough to see it as a hyped media issue, near to almost not a problem at all.  To him it sounds like when I used to get “jumped” and defend myself in actual fist fights in school over gang violence - simple stuff like colors and team sports hats that that was “real bullying...” and glad it’s not like that anymore.  he sees a lot of compassion and camaraderie, and even “coddling” compared to my time than anything.  His words even being “coddling” - like, his school has email alerts “all hands on deck” if someone sent a Snapchat smoking a fake cigarette or giving a noogie - kids are smart, they know whatsup.  Also, in case you’re wondering he goes to a public school but one that is essentially better than most private schools bc of the swanky location where his Mom lives in a tier 1 east coast city.  It’s very diverse, mixed, and cool but also kinda, again, “swank” all at once.  Meaning, it’s not some random farm town in the Midwest."

WeddingPhotography,ffe3bb2,t1_ffdzonw,1579835596.0,"Gotcha - totally makes sense.  And I’ve been a pro (agency, freelance, and even government contract level) for about 10yrs.  It’s pretty relentless.  It sounds like you’ll hate it a few years in.  You really have to dig all that come with, and honestly it’s so damned hard to begin with.  The ability to charge high fees comes with huge responsibility.  I now see how a wedding photographer could be $10k, but you can’t be a “snapshot” photographer.  You have to earn that $10k.

Also, again, re: branding and tone.  This is your call.  There are studies that show how swearing and low mannered attitudes usually come from smarter people, that being “disagreeable” is better for business, and so on.  I live half the year in Japan, even the young and hip mobile first generation use an almost categorized “2nd language” for formal only situations, it’s not “old-fashioned” it’s tradition they stuck with.  Maybe that’s could be you.  

Personal experience: I know for me - people took me way more serious when I stopped being a “homie” and started being a business contractor.  I would hear all the accolades and the “hell yeah I want to do rad shit bro “ back til I was blue in the face but seldom booked.  So I acted more like a classic old business and I’ve had my best two years ever.  I’m not even joking about uniforms - it works, I see it.  Some of those “bros” may be part-time hustlers who saw half a gary V video and this is their jam for this year."
WeddingPhotography,ffdza2u,t3_et2z1p,1579832652.0,"Yeah I think what you are forgetting is it’s “your brand” - you can be cordial and polite and not swear, wear a uniform even,  and that’s fine, that’s your brand.  Some other young “bros” maybe they do it bc they realized it worked, or their mentors do it, etc.  it’s part of their brand now, and that’s that.  

As far as not being into Instagram - I mean... I don’t assume you’re proposing to manage anyone’s Instagram other than your own?  Then don’t worry about it - unless you see a biz opportunity- like an upcharge to have 10 Instagram deliverables during the event, edited (laptop/iPad) in 4:5 for $500 or something.  (Good businesspeople always see an opportunity not a reason to complain).  

Any time I hear someone bemoan Instagram while getting into photography, it’s a red alert.  It’s like hating flying but working as a stewardess.  If you hate it now, you’ll def hate it more later."
JoeRogan,ffdsw8k,t3_et1lwq,1579828099.0,"It’s kinda funny that it’s edited and the definition of “out of context” when exactly what the podcast and long form discussion format promotes is “the entire unedited conversation” - I’m almost entirely apolitical, or politically apathetic, so I don’t really care.  But I saw this podcast and others and he said a whole array of things, some negative also - rightly so - and they’re “edited out” but this is a snappy clean 30sec glowing edit.  

Just seems like a very “non-JRE kinda thing to do...” whether it’s endorsed by and edited by JRE themselves (by that Jamie I mean lol) or Bernie camp grasping a little and not actually getting that the long form convo is the win.  To be more clear - if I were Bernie I would have left the podcast hanging on YouTube and counted on circulating views to make it all the more authentic.  Seems best as is.  It’s definitely an endorsement of sorts, and he should be grateful for it in its native form/format.  This seems pretty crummy.

personalfinance,ffdrdng,t3_et18hn,1579827061.0,"Dude - I’ve never heard someone vocalize this, that I also experience.   I had a rollercoaster ride.  Grew up terribly and poor as a kid.  Did some very good “self-made” (very modest though, just smart...) in early 20s and had luxury real estate in a tier 1 city, a wife, high credit, disposable income.  Then divorced.  Ruined credit.  Crushed savings.  Foreclosed.  Tax debt.  Banged up for late 20s/early 30s.  Was even homeless for a time. 

I fixed all that recently, and have had a great year/2 in my career.  Now I have (nearly) 2yrs salary in savings, and I can’t even look at my balance online.  Freaks me out more than having nothing.  I’ve tried to reason out why.  I often tell people that say they have it tough that “it never relaxes - you don’t wake up and have a somewhat fat bank account and suddenly chill out, if anything it’s more stressful for some odd reason...”.  No one thinks that’s the case but I assure them it’s just that - “stressful.”  

I even used to have a lot of /or “only” cash bc I was back on taxes and didn’t know what I owed, didn’t file, so I was afraid of being levied (it happened 3x so it wasn’t baseless).  I thought it was a leftover of what I dubbed as “living like a criminal/drug dealer” even though I wasn’t one?

When Italian Americans were coming to the US in the late 1800s they were met with xenophobia, lynching etc.  Columbus was Italian (Italian American kinda?) and was chose to represent a simple nod to Italian heritage.

languagelearning,ffbeegz,t3_esoxl5,1579761733.0,"As far as pronunciation only, Japanese is about as exotic (read non-exotic) as Spanish is to Americans - maybe even less so, as they don’t have “trilled R” and such.  The pronunciation is most like “what you see is what you get” and for English speakers it’s basically native sounds, “Takamoto” “Honda” “Suzuki” and “Toyota” don’t have any mystery dipthongs, silent vowels or use sounds we don’t use in English.  The vowel sounds are 100% uniform, and that may actually be the strain for English speakers.  It’s not “suh-zOOki “ it’s “soo-zoo-ki.”  Hangul’s (Korean) writing system is supposed to be almost ideal and as modern as it gets.

As far as taking a glass to the bathroom - that shouldn’t be unusual at all (I thought of everything/angle...).  It’d almost be more strange to NOT take a drink to restroom as roofies and such is still a thing, but also servers grabbing what they think is empty bottles and glasses and tossing an almost full drink out (that happens a ton)."
AskMen,ff2lblr,t3_era7tn,1579511517.0,"Order a seltzer, ginger ale or anything with ice and a lime.  It’s not like people ask or sniff your drink to make sure it’s alcoholic.  It’ll look like a vodka & soda.  Or order a non-alcoholic beer and have it poured into a glass. I’ve gone as far as to order a beer with a dark bottle (brown or green like Heineken) and pour it out in bathroom to refill with water (usually water on tap in bar counter) - now while that sounds crazy, it was purely adaptive because when I first became sober I truly ran into “peer pressure” so rather than fight it I just found ways to blend in.  Going to bars is still fun w/o drinking."

unpopularopinion,fep188s,t3_eq88hn,1579309866.0,"Totally totally super duper agree here.  Always said a long flowing down to the ankle skirt is a hell of a lot hotter than short shorts.  There’s something terribly unsexy to me about little-to-no-clothing .,, I literally never saw the appeal.  I feel like why would you wanna see everything all hanging out.  Doesn’t get me going at all.  The subtlety does, and imprint of nice legs through flowing cloth, not walking down a street eating a popsicle in a bikini and heels.  

I don’t really like porn for this reason.  Not only is the amateur thing mostly trash (shitty bright lighting, unappealing things in focus, dumb “plot” and weird staging) but I’d be waaaaay more turned on by something cinematic that hints at, and sure, maybe even “goes there fully” but with the attention to detail and sensory experience of a well done film.  I’ve seen a few foreign films that went “all in” - there’s one 70s Italian film that has an outright blow job, and a Korean film that had all but a full out exposed sex scene.  (Was romantic, and dramatic, but well done).  

Further/rant: I always wondered why there’s not more of a market for, however niche, really well done cinematic porn.  I know Erika Lust does it, but that’s about it.  In the movie boogie nights Burt Reynolds character Jack Horner kept exclaiming how he “wanted to make real films, not shitty smut” and the plot goes on to show how he was forced out of that pursuit and into making shitty amateur VHS home movies and I’m still not sure why that’s the reality... I feel like people would really get into well done porn.  Maybe as everything has gone boutique (food, clothing, coffee/drinks, transportation/home design) and bespoke, porn should also?  I think there’s some value to shitty Lo fi stuff too, it’s not all shit, but about 99% of it certainly is.   Doesn’t turn me on in the least.  (Oddly the self-made phone stuff is better than the real camera crew at a phoney car wash center staffed by “bad girls”).  I literally get more turned on having my hair cut by a quiet cute girl at a salon.  1000x.  Maybe it’s heady too, like I dig seeing a strong woman in charge doing her thing as well as exude talent also, but I find that subtle line of intimate/could go further waaaaaaaay hotter than “real estate sluts.”"

Instagramreality,fe2mrqu,t3_ennf93,1578840634.0,"Y’all all pilgrims.  None of the photographic process is “natural” it’s a photograph with super hyped stroboscopic lighting that actually accentuates “flaws” and is unflattering and strangely freezes a moment In time that our brain isn’t used to seeing and it makes us calculate the image strangely.  It almost typically doesn’t “make people look good” - like how people look great at a dim bar but look “too exposed/too much” in a supermarket or fluorescent lit pharmacy lighting. 

it’s OK to take that stuff (“flaws”) out in post in a high key photo.  They aren’t flaws.  They’re artefacts of the strange photographic process. You DONT see that stuff when you’re in a cafe sitting a across from someone who is moving and talking and in a more natural environment chatting and such.
