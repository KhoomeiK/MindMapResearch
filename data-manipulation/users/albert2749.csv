Coronavirus,ffpzesi,t3_euk9ws,1580112220.0,"The reason I think the death count will be high is because the hospitals will be overfilled. Sweden for instance has had big problems for the last 2 years to take care of the normal healthcare. If the Coronavirus comes here, we’re not gonna be able to handle it well expert says."
Anxiety,ffoi66f,t1_ffobxgt,1580077836.0,"I know it’s bad, I haven’t smoked a cig ever before. I was overly obsessed about not smoking as a kid. I think it was because my anxious mind.  I have just had problems like chest pains, heart palpitations, stress and anxiety. Even though I have taken care of myself, I’ve taken some tests and my values are really good. Yet I feel like I’m about to die from a stroke some nights. After a long time of dealing with this, the cig just helped. But I suppose it’s not a solution."
Anxiety,ffobhex,t1_ffo8lc3,1580075923.0,It’s not legal and I really don’t liked who I became. And i was retarded enough to trigger a hasch poisoning. I guess a normal cig just brought back memories.
Anxiety,ffoavbp,t1_ffo9r92,1580075830.0,"Yeah, that’s  true. I used to smoke weed a lot and I just had this pack of cig left from a year ago. Not gonna become a smoker, since I like to run half marathons. Thanks for caring"
Anxiety,ffoaglc,t1_ffo9xee,1580075711.0,"Exactly, The anxiety is illogical. It’s my worst enemy"
Anxiety,ffo9lsn,t3_eudjcd,1580075415.0,"I had this the other day. I got death anxiety out of nowhere and freaked out. But I realised I was more scared of dying of a stroke from anxiety than the virus. I slept like shit that night, but you just gotta convince yourself that you’re not in danger and that anxiety is the enemy. 
I know, it’s impossible but I always find it nice to hear during my episodes."
Anxiety,ffo8ppi,t1_ffo7gp9,1580075233.0,"Thanks for replying, I will keep that in mind."
Anxiety,ffo8m2i,t1_ffo7woc,1580075214.0,"Okay, thanks for sharing. I just feel so awesome now. With the anxiety and possibly light tinnitus I just feel so chill."

Coronavirus,ffkot9v,t3_eu42rn,1580026306.0,You could propose that to them if it will make you feel better. But you’re young and even if you get it you’ll be fine. But wash your hands and take care off your hygiene and you’ll be fine.

offmychest,fegjnrj,t1_fegjfp1,1579094805.0,"A pro tip is to use sentences if you want people to listen. I too struggle with English and I didn’t see the point of having full stops, but it’s important if you people to read it."
offmychest,fegj93f,t3_ep28h0,1579094465.0,A start could be to use this thing called sentences.
Drugs,fdrya1e,t1_fdrw6ye,1578691498.0,"Yeah you’re prolly right. This has been a good tough nut to crack, I was just so confused. Questioned everything."

Advice,fdnwjpo,t1_fdntzah,1578594294.0,"You’re referring to interval running? That is good. 
 
But if you want to take care of your heart, which also will help you lose weight you should split your exercise to two components. 

- Raising your pulse, causing you to sweat about 150 minutes a week. This could be interval running, lifting weights, but preferably a combo. 
It’s important to exercise your muscles. To help your posture, but also terminate calorie excess. Some of the energy from your food will go to building muscles.

- As well as getting to a high step count. This will not only burn calories, but it is also good to keep maintain a young brain. Try to distribute this throughout the day, because when you sit still for too long your metabolic rate goes downs."
Advice,fdnsrb4,t3_emd20w,1578592091.0,"If you want to lose weight you have to start by adjusting your diet. I’d suggest that you try to shake off sugar. But don’t forget to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, thus you don’t go around too hungry. Starving yourself isn’t sustainable. 

If that doesn’t work, you could try (LCHF) Low Carbs High Fat diet. This means that you cut out almost all carbohydrates and replace it with healthy fats. Avocado, eggs, vegetables aso... there is plenty of recipes in that community. 

Then in addition to that you could start by power walking, but look out for knee, hip or back problems. Walking/running does counter back pains but you have to make sure you’re walking correctly. The key is to have the right shoes."
monkeyspaw,fdlbqhn,t3_elz7tr,1578520628.0,Can you link us to the original thread?
Anxiety,fdguqe6,t3_elcf1p,1578408810.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I used to get that a lot after I had fapped when I was 13. I used to talk on random clash of clans global chats and freak out. I used to want to have my brain stored up on a computer chip or something, but as I grew older I understood the true powers of boredom. It is something I had forgotten about, due to my anxiety. 

If you like probability (almost facts) , you will very likely live for a long time. You got plenty of time to figure this out. Today I’m 19 and I rarely think of death in a scary way, but it still happens occasionally. I got other problems and death in a way works as a motivation to do what’s expected of me and take good care of myself."
BingeEatingDisorder,fdg7xwc,t1_fdg36z4,1578383797.0,"Well, I’m a fan of arugula and I don’t mind eating eggs. But for most parts I don’t love Vegetables, I usually just put it on spicy food."
relationships,fddrzvv,t3_ekv11y,1578322455.0,"I don’t like the impression I get from this guy, would you want him to keep nude photos (trophies) of you if you broke up?"
BingeEatingDisorder,fddac5j,t1_fdcz3sx,1578302335.0,Thank you for replying. I suppose I could eat more vegetables and I will try again.
Anxiety,fdbrs0m,t1_fdbl0db,1578261034.0,"You’re parents are adults. It’s always frustrating to lose money, but nobody is hurt and that’s your parents concern. Their job is not to ground you for your mistakes, it’s supposed to help you. Punishment is supposed to help you understand that you’ve done something wrong and then help you reflect upon it. 

But first of all, you haven’t intentionally done anything wrong. Everyone will give you a pass on this one. This anxiety is already punishment enough, you don’t need to be lectured. 

Instead you ask your parents for help, tell them that you’re worried and that it is bothering you."
Anxiety,fdb9v26,t3_eki0gq,1578255274.0,"Don’t worry, if you bought it you can always fight it, since you can’t be hold accountable for a purchase given your age and anxiety. I presume you don’t have your own credit card? 
Even if you somehow managed to buy it, calm down, you made a mistake. What’s important is that you feel okay. That should be your priority."
gonewild,fd9rpx0,t3_eke5d9,1578237146.0,Where specifically? Or do I get to choose?

Anxiety,fd1zhl3,t1_fd1xyjh,1578139245.0,"Well my mood can fluctuate a lot. One moment I miss my dad next I hate him because of his loud breathing. I know that it’s my fault, but I feel that if I wasn’t so anxious all the time I would yell more. I do get mad and struggle to sleep but I just don’t express it loud."
chubby,fczd8cq,t3_ejf4hh,1578098597.0,"Believe it or not, but I actually suffer from some body dysphoria I think. But you’re confidence, happiness and body just looks amazing."
Needafriend,fcza2dw,t3_ejo6ho,1578096724.0,"You just have to chase that magic. You’re in a tough spot and what you’re feeling is natural. I suggest that you should get cognitive behaviour therapy. This could help you with anxiety, depression, self harm/suicidal thoughts or poor body images. It is supported by research and I looked at your profile and I can assure you that a lot of people think you’re beautiful. Don’t forget that"
