aww,fe92v0k,t3_eo135x,1578933608.0,It is so intentional on the older cats part. She gets it untangled and walks away!
aww,fdmc4yg,t3_elxvtw,1578545243.0,"Jg307 says their mother needs assistance. This sounds like she needs a dog for the Deaf. One that alerts you when you drop things, the door bell rings, phone ringing or smoke detectors. Maybe beyond using hand signals to get the dog to respond to standard sit and lie down commands."
