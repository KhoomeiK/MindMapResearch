dating_advice,fdk3qpq,t3_eleoxp,1578495327.0,"Something similar yeah but worse.  Not dated, but I had a friend. She have really bad anxieties and really bad depression. Which I don’t have any problem with, but she constantly acts like she’s the victim and always tries to make you look like the bad person for not trying to “understand” her situation. But what got me to stop being friends with her was when my dad passed away 2 years ago and i wanted to talk to someone but she didn’t even care she turned the convi around and made it about her (like always). And how she always expect me (everyone actually) to drop all our problems and be there for her. If we’re not she goes and complains about how she doesn’t have any real friends or shit like that. Cut her off then."
dating_advice,fd36gbc,t3_ejrv7o,1578155190.0,"I definitely agree. I don’t want someone who picks and chooses when to text me. I truly understand we’re all adults and have lives and work, i don’t need you to text me every second but if you disappear on me for days and tell me you’re busy........ yeah i’m not having that."
depression,fcrvl2p,t1_fcqksif,1577907209.0,It’s kinda hard to be there or help others when you can’t even help yourself.
depression,fcp1vej,t1_fcoyuki,1577847917.0,"And i don’t wanna be that person who keeps telling them to not give up, that it’s okay, that it will get better one day because they know that and most of the time it actually upsets them more (i’ve seen it happen) also, i once suggested to another friend to maybe talk to a therapist but they took at the wrong way and got mad and i don’t want the same thing to happen this time. and please don’t apologize it’s no problem at all."
