DIY,ffjbhe2,t1_ffjb21v,1579994807.0,That's nice of you to say. Thank you.
DIY,ffj9uur,t1_ffi13sn,1579993820.0,I thought it was rough when I bought my apartment years back. Guy with mental issues and self harming. Took a long time to clear up but nothing as severe as your place. Good job.
Naturewasmetal,ffgg2yo,t1_fffjz8f,1579905435.0,Do mining companies have to rescue fossils? I know that probably might be different depending on region but if they have no commitment to safely extract fossils then it's quite good that they at least try rather than just digging through it because it's in the way.
thisismylifenow,ff7f0n1,t1_ff7007q,1579648035.0,As a Brit I have also thought it's a bit odd. Apparently there isn't a specific law about driving and drinking an alcoholic drink at r same time. But it is illegal to drive while over the limit. If true then one can actually drink and drive (alcoholic or otherwise) so long as within limits.
CasualUK,ff6yrag,t1_ff5lzlp,1579637651.0,"Used a similar thing for my wife's car years ago. Worked better than not having one but still took a while given that it only outputs to a small area. I still have it somewhere, should probably try it again."

classiccars,fey3h0y,t1_fex63oa,1579440298.0,I bought a Rover 100 for my wife her as her first car about 10 years ago. Cost £100 then. You don't really see them on the road much anymore.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fe7dclk,t1_fe6n3ly,1578913017.0,Like some do in r/aww. Look at this happy little lizards smile.
WTF,fdwny7n,t1_fdui8nw,1578760677.0,Kind of opposite to one of those snot suckers.
dashcamgifs,fdu82tm,t1_fdr1rvm,1578729210.0,I do the same. Why ruin somebody's day. When I first got my licence years ago I accidentally soaked a woman and her child (I hadn't considered the puddle to be really deep what with limited driving experience). I still feel bad about it to this day and really don't want to repeat that.
dashcamgifs,fdu7f99,t1_fdqgy4u,1578728899.0,I'm using Relay. It's ace!
CarTalkUK,fddqkyd,t1_fddj2hh,1578321345.0,That's interesting. I sold my tubular exhaust manifold to a guy who put a kv6 into a ZR. Just assumed it would be inanely fun to have.
CarTalkUK,fddi5ek,t1_fd9jlru,1578313257.0,I think so yes. They put it in a few others models like ZS but yeah mainly the 75 & ZT. I think I saw a Kia Sedona or something like that had the KV6 engine also. I read somewhere that the predecessor was the Honda 2.7 used in the Rover Sterling's (800 was?).
CarTalkUK,fd8ps3y,t1_fd7k5uo,1578221548.0,"I had the KV6 engine in mine which was solid apart from the VIS motors failing and weak thermostat housing. People would always comment about head gasket failures just because of the reputation Rover got but in reality that issue wasn't common at all on this engine.

The ZT190 was perhaps the best car I've owned to date. I really regret getting rid of it. Used to have a ZT260 also but I much preferred the 190. V8 was over rated by enthusiasts."
funny,fd3s85x,t1_fd3126u,1578161239.0,"My wife is from Jakarta. Flooding is just expected while she lived there. When I first visited her family I asked why was their fridge was on a small table. I was told it keeps it safe when the ground floor floods. 

Later we were driving on some street and they were rebuilding it but it was easily 1+ metres higher than the old road. I asked way, was told it's because the road floods. So what happens to the houses next too it. They will flood next and the owners have to live with it or rebuild their houses higher."

todayilearned,fcsj2ht,t1_fcrkwtt,1577917500.0,"I work in the same company as my brother in law. It is very flexible for stuff like this, he has no excuse from an employment view. We're also in the UK so no complications having to pay for a visit. But I do understand the whole out of routine thing. I'm probably guilty of that too with some things.

My thoughts with health, if there's any doubt then there's no doubt. Go to the doctor."
todayilearned,fcs3xkm,t1_fcrgjre,1577911110.0,"Totally agree. 

My aunt has been a GP for decades. She sees patients as a mystery or challenge to help them. She once explained it that she enjoys the challenge to figure out the problem and help people. The nature of the problem doesn't really factor for her (meaning whether it's the heart, arm, cock, vag, etc). All the same, but the severity might not be hence the need to investigate."
todayilearned,fcs2jyk,t1_fcrz7h2,1577910507.0,I'm in the UK. Health care free (unless Boris fucks up). I hear financial horror stories from the US. I honestly don't know how people for with it there. Must be such a worry all the time.
todayilearned,fcr3p1e,t1_fcqyg8t,1577896329.0,"This happened to my brother in law, apart from the dying bit. He had an infection on his leg which he though would heal itself and told nobody about the severity. He was limping for a week but we all thought it was jogging related. When it got very bad he showed it to his wife who took him straight to the doctor who referred him directly to hospital. He was in for almost a week and 3 months later still not able to jog properly. They were worried that the infection might have spread north especially to his kidneys. Thankfully they had it under control.

GP's are there to help and nobody should feel silly for going. The embarrassment he would have felt going with a small problem is minor compared to the embarrassment he felt after leaving it too long."
AdviceAnimals,fcokjex,t1_fcofbtc,1577834546.0,"That's very kind of you, thank you! I wish all the best to you and your family also."
AdviceAnimals,fcodoay,t1_fco7ps2,1577829702.0,Slightly different scenario for me and my wife. 7 years of trying for a child with a couple of unsuccessful pregnancies. Got to the point where we had accepted it wouldn't work. While it affected us both it actually made us closer. Luckily she did have a successful pregnancy and it's been all good since.
techsupport,fcmvdqm,t3_ei1k25,1577794046.0,"I had a similar issue when upgrading to Windows 10 1909. It would run for a short while then blue screen sometimes and other times the screen goes to no input. Turns out there were two issues. First was a driver left over from some dvd software I had years ago (driver didn't uninstall when the software was). And also my GPU died. I still think it's too coincidental that it died within a couple of days but I bought a new card which worked perfectly.

To check what drivers may have caused the bluescreen I downloaded BlueScreenView which opens the dump files.

To identify the drivers I used a Microsoft tool called Autoruns. This shows you which drivers are loading on boot. Firstly ignore the MS drivers. Then look for anything which looks a bit odd and delete it from start up. Did that one driver at a time and found the faulty one. 

To get to safe mode or system repair the boot needs to be interrupted I think 3 time. After my pc beeps on boot I hit the reset button. Did it 3 or 4 times and it goes to repair. From there can choose to boot to safe mode. If you have no output on monitor then switch to using the onboard output."
techsupport,fcmuou3,t1_fcmolv3,1577793141.0,I had a similar issue once. I had onboard sound card and an Asus one on pci. The pci board produced a lot more noise than the onboard but still noise on both. I never figured out why but put it down the the motherboard. In the end it annoyed which is what prompted me to make an external dac (bought a DIY reference kit). Been running the same setup for about 4 years now.
techsupport,fcmo5x4,t1_fcmkgtm,1577783891.0,Using an external USB DAC instead of onboard audio should remove the issue. Did for me anyway. Not had much experience with PC's buy with car audio the same ground loop issue can occur where the alternator hums over the speaker with the engine speed. This can be removed by putting inline a ground loop isolator on the audio wires. From memory this happens when the grounding points are at difference locations on the chassis and different grounded devices interfere with each other. I don't know if the same would apply to a houses electrics.
Ford,fcguyek,t1_fc385r5,1577644253.0,I recently hired a car for work and they gave me one of these. Think it was the 125 version but not sure. It was actually great fun to drive and for such a small car it was comfy on a 300 mile round trip. It had loads of good features but I couldn't figure out the cruise control (probably me not knowing how and just gave up) and very economical. Wasn't keen on the tablet style screen though. Great little car all round.

CasualUK,fcdkvnj,t1_fc9fbji,1577610987.0,The one where you put it on top of a cup of tea for it to soften? Those things are great.
atheism,fc5yz3m,t1_fc5uwbx,1577468755.0,"Thanks for taking the time to respond. Sounds like a very good approach. I haven't given much thought to how to deal with these challenges as a family as my son is only two at the moment, hence the questions. I have some time to figure it out still. (Also I need to figure out how as a white father of a mixed son how to deal with potential racism as he grows older as it's something I haven't had to deal with before - that's a totally different matter though!)"
