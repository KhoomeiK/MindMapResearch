The next morning was the first time that I ever said to myself, ""I need a better relationship with alcohol"" and I'm happy to say that the month that's happened since then has been alcohol free outside of a couple of days where I had 1-2 beers, and with every day that goes by I really hope that I don't have experiences like I just had in the future. Distancing myself even this little from it is the longest I have since I started drinking and it's really making me think about the health complications and that all of the side effects are just not worth it."

Voting in this country has been based on the idea that white men who lead families vote, and post Suffrage sometimes their wives vote too. If you can make the white men happy, then you'll get the votes you need. Until recently people just didn't have a voice, and what we are currently going through is the creation of a new class of American voters who are racially and ethnically diverse, educated, gaining wealth, and who believe that the Republic is a place for ideals and can be reformed beyond the white men club that it's been forever."
PaMedicalMarijuana,ffdvrcr,t1_ffdu901,1579830135.0,"Depends entirely on how they legalize. They can legalize without touching the medical program, and without significant legal changes medical dispensaries simply can only sell to card holders. 

In reality, PA would probably do what a number of other states who have moved from a medical program to legal + medical have done, which is that they rather quickly and inefficiently decide to open up medical dispensaries to anyone after a certain date. The dispensaries themselves then largely try to control the flow of new legal patients by jacking up prices and only selling small amounts to them, while trying to maintain the medical market as it is. Sometimes this works well, other times it can mean long lines and no product for everyone.

Over a long enough timeline though, in any legal market that doesn't artificially restrict growing licenses too harshly, within 1 or 2 years there's generally plenty of cannabis and prices begin to drop and stock improves. 

Honestly, it's hard to see the PA Medical market as being strong enough even in 2 years to accommodate a legal market without shutting down from lack of product or by being criticized for a lack of dispensaries. They'd be much better off setting up a completely different system (that's also more fair and doesn't have as low artificial restrictions) and then seeing if the medical market can survive separately in the no-taxes, prescription-only world. Currently medical growers and dispensaries in PA are running at heavy losses, hoping to build some relationships and brand strength before full legalization happens while being supported by large parent companies. If legalization doesn't come to PA quick enough, it's possible that we could see mergers and closings of existing licensed growers/dispensaries, which could be an even bigger problem for the program.

Maybe people just aren't so into Halo as they used to be, or it's just no longer 2004-2008 where Halo was so popular that people literally started a digital animation studio from videos they made in-game. Halo was a cultural phenomenon, and I don't see any amount of work 343 putting into it reviving the franchise without really re-engineering and re-thinking huge portions of the gameplay in order to draw in the generation of teenagers playing CS:GO and LoL. Maybe Halo: Infinite will be that project, but the MCC is largely Microsoft's attempt at ensuring that the Halo franchise will play back-compatible on current and future Microsoft devices for the foreseeable future. They know people who are 25 and up will love Halo, and they'll love it when they sell it to them in Windows 11 and on the 2026 Surface and on Steam.

In a lot of ways, it's up to the fans today to make Halo relevant enough again to ensure that we get proper support. Selling games isn't enough, especially when you're a big company like Microsoft with 450 people to support making Halo content. There needs to be a cultural reason for employees to invest their time into staying late and ensuring that the sound programming is perfect, or to really refine that unlocked FPS mode, or to clean up a couple textures that Bungie missed. Everyone knows Halo on Steam is going to sell boatloads, at least temporarily. Nobody knows if anyone is still going to want to play it after every Halo is released on Steam and Infinite comes out. Support the game and if we're lucky we will see support. If not, Halo is over.
