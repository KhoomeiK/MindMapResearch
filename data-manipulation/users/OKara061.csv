> You said you workout, which is a really good thing, but if youve managed to become really buff 

Im not buffed, no not at all. I have like extra 20 pounds that i need to lose right now(im around 200pounds) but other than that, i feel like i am muscular enough. I dont want to be like the Rock or anything, just wanna feel good in clothes that i wear, thats all. I dont even want to have abs.

&#x200B;

My main problem is, and i know that is 100% the problem, i always have that voice in my head telling me ""You are not enough. Why should she like you while even you dont like yourself. She is just acting kind, there is no deep meaning of her acts. She has a friendly character, thats all."" And comments like these. I have been trying to get rid of that son of a bitch but he is just stuck there. I have a close friend who had 3 girlfriends since i met him. He tells me that all those girls were curious why i dont have a gf with my looks but i feel like he is just saying this to be kind to me. Thats the problem. Even when people say good things about me and my looks and my character, im just doubting them and thinking they are just being kind. I can't believe anything they say because of that voice, no matter how hard i try. I dont know why im telling these stuff to some random person on the internet but it makes me feel better to write these. 

&#x200B;

You are right about reaching out and meeting new people. Have been trying that, met a new girl. Grabbed coffee twice and had awesome time. But then that fucking voice came in and i kinda ignored her. Now the energy is gone. You know what i mean, like when you first met with someone everything goes good and once you stop talking, now you are strangers again. Yeah, im like that right now. I really liked that girl and she showed some interest but that fucking voice ruined my life, again. Anyway, what i wanted to say that, you are right about meeting people and thank you for giving me advice."
