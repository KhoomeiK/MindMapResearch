SkincareAddiction,ffghqcx,t1_ffgfqni,1579906500.0,"Well my problem for a long time was acne so I would use retinoids, but that went away after 6 mo of accutane. I wash my face with a clean washcloth morning and night, but avoid my cheeks bc they don’t get oily enough. It sounds lame but switching to the washcloth for exfoliation was the single best thing I’ve ever done for my complexion. We wash our pillow cases once a week.i use some pimecrolimus cream (alternative to steroid) above lip bc I have this weird rarely recurring red scaly crap like eczema or something. Im a guy so I don’t use anything for makeup, makeup removal, etc. 

Now I’m experimenting with some cerave on my cheeks for redness and looking for a good daily facial sunscreen, if you have any recommendations. I’m also looking for something for enlarged pores on my nose. That’s why I joined the sub."

I think capitalism should run its course as it normally does, and then at the end of the day we have a common sense progressive tax program that creates safety nets on a per need basis, at the expense of those it will hurt the least (and whom taxing will hurt the economy the least), the uber wealthy, who have billions of untouched dollars sitting growing in a Swiss bank account somewhere."

politics,fffr0bo,t1_fffo33j,1579889915.0,"Great question. I volunteer for a group called Wolf-PAC that is trying to pass a campaign finance reform amendment through article V of the Constitution, which is a way of passing federal constitutional amendments at the state level (it was designed as an important check / balance against an inactive federal Congress). 

Historically, many (most?) federal constitutional amendments started as article V state pushes. Generally when Congress sees that the states are going around them, they will nip it in the bud by passing an amendment at the federal level.

Beyond that, I would just support Congressional candidates that have gone on the record supporting a Constitutional amendment supporting campaign finance reform, because after the Citizen's United precedent, an amendment is necessary."

politics,fffdh6s,t1_fffdaef,1579881552.0,"My point is that often founders and CEOs take a salary that is already much higher than the other employees.

And I mean, the wealth is skimmed from the other employees and stake holders at a disproportionate amount, almost by definition. No one personally generates a billion dollars of value in their lifetime. Our perception makes us think they do, but really it's just individuals taking more than their fair share of businesses that hit a critical mass of growth, made up of hundreds of thousands of people all getting paid less value than they produce. That's basically what a successful business IS. We're just advocating for lowering those margins a bit. It wouldn't even affect the incentives to create a successful business or take risk."

Generally, so are the CEOs. What people don't seem to understand is there is a big difference between saying ""people shouldn't be rewarded for risk"" and ""there should be some common sense limit on accumulated wealth"". 10 million dollars is a reward for risk. A billion dollars, you and all of your descendants can live at the height of luxury for their entire lives. 72 billion dollars? Welp, we could feed and house every needy person in the entire country with that, and stimulate the economy to unprecedented levels, enriching the middle class too, but we'd better just let it rot in Bezos's index fund out of principle."
politics,fffcslx,t1_fffaaxt,1579881121.0,"> aren’t billionaires billionaires for their way of thinking and not so much for the work they do?

Yes, the question is how much are we willing to reward people who are really good at playing the game. We don't hate billionaires, we want them around revolutionizing the world, we are capitalists, not communists.

We just advocate for a reasonable limit on the amount of accumulated wealth. It is at an absolutely absurd level. If we taxed Bezos at like 50% after his first billion, his life would not change in any meaningful way, and we could [literally feed and house every homeless or hungry person in the country with the money](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wall-street-bonus-alternatives_n_5000118?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHjGqmEMdVZb-6pNaxUWT-o6pGYL30sEEYiaRqaeHE2bQON2HOflPqsWU1Bi16oKkxkEVrrNvTBYjLIL2K0mkhr7gPUtoTIRxXNLyMH1i1GkjYxqC_GM05kZk99i3YvqrHW1PlmXnjj2sm0hxvjHdC2an8MN8CqscsL61egz1y5n). This is completely justified because of the pittance that Bezos and Amazon currently pay in taxes. They pay a significantly lower % than you or me. Why is such an anti-progressive tax fair?

How much do we think people deserve for good ideas? Everything? Because that is what it is costing us."
politics,fffc2uu,t1_fffamhi,1579880673.0,"I'm rolling my eyes because that is not what I said and you know it. Let's put it this way with some admittedly fuzzy math: 

1) Jeff Bezos is one of 750,000 employees at Amazon. 

2) Amazon's valuation was 1 trillion dollars in 2018. 

3) Jeff Bezo's net worth is $72 billion. 

That means his fortune is 1/13 of Amazon's total value, whereas the average employee's is 1/750,000 of Amazon (or actually much less because of how much of Amazon is owned by investors and the average Amazon employee has nowhere near a million $).

Do you Jeff did 58,000x as much **work** as the average employee? Does he DESERVE 58,000x as much as someone who is also working full-time (or more than that, given the reports about hours worked at Amazon)? Does anyone *deserve* a massive amount of money that they can't use, when there are hundreds of thousands of other stakeholders also working full-time and who could stimulate the economy by actually spending the money on their basic needs?

How much do we think a good bet, anti-competitive business practices, and a whole lot of luck *deserve* be rewarded? I've heard the idea floated that any income beyond a billion should be taxed at 99%. I'd like to hear an economist's take on it, but that seems reasonable to me."
politics,fff98py,t1_fff5wy4,1579878851.0,"Really great points, but Paul inherited $200 million from Linda 20 years ago, which would make up a large percentage of his current fortune (after investing/interest), and he also earned a disproportionate amount of the royalties from the Beatles' discography (compared to the other bandmembers) due to the others' deaths.

However, he's still a great guy and a great example.

Now, Jay-Z, on the other hand, literally started as a crack dealer, which he built his early career on. Now he's a record producer, who are notorious for taking a ridiculous amount of their musician's earnings. He made a lot of the rest by investing, which is glorified betting, not really producing anything of value."
politics,fff8cjn,t1_fff6a1e,1579878245.0,"""Take"" was the word, not steal. The wealth that they received is disproportionate to the effort they put in relative to the rest of their company. Their value is not in what they produced, but figuring out vulnerable markets and positioning themselves to benefit, while creating a valuable product in the meantime. Should they be rewarded for that? Sure. Should they get billions that they don't need and can't use while their underlings get a meager salary and no stake? No. And we're also ignoring the anti-competitive actions that are almost *necessary* to create billion dollar businesses, subverting the incentives that make capitalism a good system in the first place. The best case is acquisitions / mergers (which still hurt consumers), and the worst case is deliberately making your competitors products worse, possibly through patent trolling, legal action, or bribing Congress (which is why we need regulations like campaign finance reform).

Bill Gates is a notable example of a benevolent billionaire, but interesting note - he and Warren Buffet are a select few billionaires that also advocate for much higher taxes on the uber wealthy - because they know that their fellow bilionaires can not be trusted to do good of their own volition, even if it wouldn't affect them at all. Maybe that should tell us something."
politics,fff7q14,t1_fff66qx,1579877813.0,"Oh I'm incredibly pessimistic towards government right now. It just so happens that currently, the group that moans the most about government overreach are the most corrupt - the ones lining their pockets with bribes, attacking other countries, etc., the exact sort of thing that Libertarians hate. There are no true libertarian candidates right now, not even close.

But I wouldn't vote for one anyway. There are government success stories. Socialized healthcare in nordic countries is a model for the rest of the world, and our regulated utilities work incredibly well here - landline phone, electric, etc. we can basically just take for granted and get at a reasonable price, and everybody acts like doing the same to mobile/internet would be a disaster.

Beyond that, the fact of the matter is that certain issues require collective action to accomplish, like solving global warming- there is no incentive for the individual to act, but there is great incentive for the group to act. That is why government was created, and I don't think the fatalistic notion of ""well government sucks at everything"" rings true."
politics,fff73vu,t1_fff38mg,1579877389.0,"My gut reaction was like ""Are you saying they didn't earn their money? They started an incredibly profitable business"" 

... And then I started thinking about billionaires and their companies and what a tiny infinitesimal fraction of the total work the founders/CEO did compared to the other employees of their businesses (let alone the anti-competitive action they usually need to do to create a multibillion dollar business). And if you look at those that make their money speculating on the markets, it's even worse. What value do they provide other than ""providing liquidity"", something with nebulous intangible benefit? Every dollar they make by speculating is effectively skimmed out the market, out of the pockets of mom and pop investors trying to use the market for what it was actually designed for."
