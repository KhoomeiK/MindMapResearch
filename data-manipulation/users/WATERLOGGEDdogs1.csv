I was getting Food and was checking out, I put my money on the counter for the cashier, a highschool aged African America girl. She looked at me and said ""Is that for me?"" And I said yeah. ""You oughta be more respectful, I am a person, don't make other people's lives hard, treat others with respect."" And ever since I have ALWAYS handed money to the cashier. Never on the counter. I wish I could go back and thank her. She taught me a valuable life lesson."

Gamecube,ff6j2gk,t1_ff6fnhd,1579628269.0,2013? Either way I was going through an oatmeal phase and wanted a microwave. Just easier to fix than replace. Not to mention it still worked and was like 100$ cheaper than a new microwave

I was working at a Gas Station around independence day so it was kinda busy. This dude came in and the best way I can describe him is the stupid kid with the propeller hat grew up to be 7 feet tall. Anyways, pulls up to the counter and asks if the Lady working earlier like the book he got her. We had a 70 year old lady named Susan who was a 100% Boomer working and she mentioned she like John Wayne, dude went and got a book for her, and she had left it, but I told him she had received it and loved it, then he wants to show me his coin collection. I deny and he just pulls it out of his back pack, sure enough MF had all the 50 state coins with a story bout his Grandpa. Wants me to hold it behind the counter. Whatever, just move let me deal with these Customers. I start ringing people up, moving the line, and he eventually makes his way up the line, and he bought 2 bottles of Caffeinated water. Began preaching the miracles of the stuff, how it changed his life, nice and refreshing. Dude basically started a religion around caffeinated water. Mentioned he had a youtube channel about taste testing food or whatever. That's nice, move so I can help these customers. He continues to move about in the store again. Another 10 minutes and he pulls up with 4 bottles of Soda, wants 2 per bag, double bagged, and on separate transactions. This stuff continues for about an hour or so. Just constant summer saults on the Register, double bag, 2 per bag, keep this behind the counter, separate transactions. Eventually comes up to the counter with 2 bags of chips, ring him up, mother fucker says ""Can I change these? I don't support Ruffles as a Brand"" dude, what do they do? Lock the potatos in cages for their entire life? Are you worried about them tormenting the potatos? I go to my supervisor and she said it's time for him to head out. I ask him to leave and tell him he is loitering. Dude gos bananas, starts threatening us, telling us to make him leave acting all Agro. Told him the cops are on their way. He dips out pretty quick. Found out later that he went to one of our competitors and did the same BS, got asked to leave, refused and got tazed and tackled taking out their muffin display. Im told it took 5 or 6 cops to get him down.

TL:DR: Giant guy comes in, has me do ""Summer saults"" on the register. Doesn't support ruffles as a brand, gets asked to leave, gos to competitors and trashes their store."

DarwinAwards,fepn5vj,t1_fepf191,1579324973.0,The way I understood it is an explosion launches the bullet out of the chamber into the barrel and out the gun. A blank works the same way except no bullet. So essentially you are forcing a small explosion into your head. Not a smart Idea.

AskReddit,felrm8w,t1_felq87f,1579229231.0,"I was worried about opening the second ammendment can of worms but since you did, a Japanese General said ""There will be a man with a gun behind every blade of Grass"" and this is the truth, even today. In 2018 they figured all the hunters that went out in just Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin would have made up one of the biggest military forces in the world if they decided to get together. I'll try and find the article and post it in an edit

Edit: Couldn't find the article I wanted, and though this article is about the decline of hunting, in 2016 they figured almost 12M people hunted in the US. The US has about 1.2M soldiers with another 800k in reserves. So any nation wanting to invade would have to fight off almost 15M people. Wowzers!

The clitoris isn't as small as a lil ball on the top of the vagina. It is a whole network of nerves that make an arch over the top of the vagina. You need to tap and rub the top of the vagina. This should be where the G spot is. I used this knowledge with my girlfriend and got her to squirt. She never even knew she could do that!
