politics,fff1jxa,t1_fff049s,1579873157.0,Yeah but they dont do anything at a physical except tell you what's wrong. If you mention any problem they start adding codes and before you know it you have a balance.
amibeingdetained,ff1wx1a,t1_ff0w7sq,1579488050.0,I would think most doors would be badged/key pad and not physical key locks.
titanic,feu5jn8,t1_fdor5es,1579383343.0,What kind of energy or machine would they need to raise one?
Kitboga,fel0oq3,t3_ep5a3e,1579211545.0,"I think your address would be right if you typed ""PERIOD LIKE A DOT"""
radio,fekhb0b,t1_feiwprb,1579200034.0,I don't work in the radio industry but how are companies allowed to put a non-compete clause in when they are laying you off? That seems absolutely unfair when you have skill sets to work in the same industry and they know you need to find a job to pay your bills.
dogs,feeezoy,t1_fedy01e,1579032390.0,In Texas you get a new spare dog every few days! Our dogs coat can't figure out whether to stay winter mode or summer mode lol.
dogs,feeesln,t1_fedzqjs,1579032271.0,"I could see an appropriate way to ""gift"" a dog is like if you have a young teenager and they have expressed some interest in a dog get them a leash and a few books on raising dogs. Then offer to take them to the shelter and walk some dogs and get to know the process of picking one. That would be a better way than the typical here is a puppy in a box gift."
dyson,fe3skzq,t1_f9our8x,1578852492.0,In my opinion these dyson units heat the room so fast that we dont need the scheduling but prefer the upgraded filter and 350 degree oscillation over the 01 and 02 models.
explainlikeimfive,fe37fna,t1_fe33qlx,1578846665.0,Isnt a loaf of bread 1 piece of bread before all of the slices are cut? Could one argue that all sandwiches are actually hoagies?
Costco,fdkyb2o,t1_fdkus4n,1578513661.0,"Wow, I wonder how many deliveries a Buccees takes if it says Costco takes 6-12 deliveries per day!"
Costco,fdkxuxe,t1_fdko8ja,1578513397.0,"Just look at all the graphics around the pumps, it's a total marketing scheme. I just get gas wherever it's cheap and convenient. I will say that I think Exxon might have the highest marketing at the pump for ""clean"" while Valero has very little marketing at the pump. I had my previous car for 6 years using all kinds of gas and it never had any engine trouble."
ProtectAndServe,fdkhggi,t1_fdfehwj,1578503960.0,"NOT ON THE LEASE? Great Scott, call in the FBI!"
dogs,fdhap3k,t1_fdfoxfd,1578418984.0,About half of my apartment complex sends their unsupervised 4-10 years olds outside with dogs big and small who obviously cant control the dogs. It's aggravating and shocking that people expose themselves to such liability let alone putting their kids in danger. What if the dog turns on the kid walking it? Hopefully some day we will have a house with a big enough yard that my mastiff can get exercise without aggravation from idiots.
dogs,fdha8t6,t3_el4u0u,1578418739.0,People who let children (note under 13) walk dogs alone or unsupervised aggravates me to no end. I see it all the time in my apartment complex where they let 4-10 year olds walk BIG DOGS without an adult it's just asking for an attack to occur. I have had numerous run ins with my mastiff on leash being harassed by a dog where the kid couldn't hold the leash and just let it go. I usually yell at the dog NO firmly and most of the time they stop but my mastiff barks loud and he will let them know he is not there to play. I am almost tempted to get a body camera like the cops have to defend my dog when crap like this occurs.
RedLetterMedia,fdgqc8t,t1_fdge0f4,1578405537.0,That storm trooper is from Wisconsin.
cowboys,fddxz6h,t1_fddsu9k,1578326698.0,McCarthy has been in the post season 18 times while Garrett has been 5 times.
Costco,fco9p0v,t3_ei6toc,1577826943.0,Cant you just make one on Word...its just times new Roman lol
dogs,fc6ou3s,t1_fc6d4l6,1577485736.0,Why is he a bad example of the vet community?
dogs,fc5pkoi,t1_fc5kmnd,1577463248.0,"If you watch Dr Pol's show they put down a lot of animals when it is not cost effective or feasible to fix the issue. I think people living out in the country/farming communities still hold this ideology especially when you can raise a new dog, pig, or cow within just a few months."
GoogleMaps,fc5na0o,t3_eg8xhd,1577461982.0,"I drove past a streetview car 4 years ago and waved at it. I always check all of the imagery on that street to see if it ever shows up, they were probably done filming and just leaving the area."
waze,fc5n10j,t3_egb22x,1577461850.0,"I disagree, I don't think people should report moving police. When they are moving they are less likely to be running radar and more likely going to or from a call or the jail. I get phantom police reports all the time that I assume was someone reporting a moving officer since there is no one around pulled over."
amazon,fbsxsh5,t1_fbsewbr,1577063044.0,"I did put detailed instructions in there, the only thing on the box when it finally arrived said ""driver aid: palms"" and none of my instructions. Anyhow both gates were obviously open so I don't know how they couldn't access it. Anyhow the box finally arrived at like 11:30 am today. I wonder if it's because people were taking $100+ blocks with like 60 packages and people are rushing? This was at STX2/VTX2 Carrollton was where my box came from."
