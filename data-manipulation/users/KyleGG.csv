Here is a better write up of why tabs suck: 

https://stackoverflow.com/a/27425022

Also I do not agree with the argument that it is changing one setting with tabs and not changing one setting with spaces. 

You argue that converting 4 space tab to 8 space tab in an editor setting is somehow different from converting 4 spaces into a configurable tab length.

You could implement the same conversion 4spaces -> 8space tab on the render side as tab -> 4space tab, tab -> 8 space tab. With editors like vscode or atom it would be a simple package. 

This functionality isn't built in because no one wants it. Because everyone uses spaces anyway according to the dev survey. But the behaviour is not any different. If you needed a specific tab length write the package to convert spaces yourself."

agreed, much easier to hook up a raspberry pi to an array of COTS sensors and just read the outputs. 

I suggested building units as you could make make them and test them without much investment, then scale. For a project this aligns really well as you can show the design work, and if it doesn't work scale it up or project performance with more units.

To give OP more context, something like:

[x===][x===]...[x===]

Where [] is some non conductive material, === represents parallel conductors, and x represents a sensor to detect the projectile. 

Once you have build one unit, you can build several [x===] and code in a way that you can support N [x===]. This means you can test parameters like conductor length and electric field using the components you have on a single unit or a couple then scale."
ProgrammerHumor,ffta32q,t1_fft9gmm,1580214004.0,"It affects alignment. You cannot do alignment with tabs, so you have to use spaces for alignment, which in my opinion means you should always use spaces.

4 space tabs: 

    Foo myFoo    = Bar();
    Foo notMyFoo = Bar();

8 space tabs 

    Foo myFoo        = Bar();
    Foo notMyFoo = Bar();

I think doing this sort of alignment is bad practice, but it can look really nice:

    my_really_long_foo_function(Foo(),
                                Bar(), 
                                Fubar());

    my_really_long_foo_function(Foo(),

Obviously you can line break and do the following but there are many many other instances where you can use alignment to make the code look nicer:

    my_really_long_foo_function(
        Foo(),
        Bar(), 
        Fubar());


Here is a better writeup which explains why a \t is not always a \t. TLDR: Lots of the time a developer wants a \t to be 4, 2, or 8. Not all 3 at once. In other renderers a \t doesn't even mean a tab in the same way. 

https://stackoverflow.com/a/27425022

Regarding the bastardizing history, you will have one developer correcting alignment for their setup and another developer re-correcting it for his over and over and over. To them it just looks like an oversight. I have seen repos with hundreds of 'fix whitespace commits'. There is not question if you use spaces. You set a convention (4 space tabs) and it will look the same everywhere. So any pieces of code that break indentation rules or have poor alignment can be seen by everyone."

There is nothing wrong with that comment. 

Parents of the daughter almost always get the kid, because the daughter has to breastfeed the baby. I have personal experience with this.

This means that the work is heavily software development as you need to turn off the previous field as the projectile passes by. To do this well you need many sensors to know where the projectile is.

Prototype a unit capable of detecting the projectiles presence within a long apparatus and turning on and off the acceleration field. Build and program it in a way that this can be scaled. 2,4,6,8,...,64 acceleration and detection units. Chain them together. Have them each generate a field and turn off when the projectile is detected.

Since the field doesn't go that far, or isn't that strong past a certain distance you can then optimize power efficiency and turn further units off and on when a earlier unit triggers detection. 

Building scalable units will let you scale in the event you don't get the acceleration you desire. As long as each unit accelerated the projectile a little bit you can keep adding them for better performance.

I suppose how far you go is based off what this is for. My capstone team humored the idea of creating a railgun in our EE degree. I think another team did it but it sucked. I don't think it's particularly difficult however i don't think it's cheap either. You also cannot underestimate the software component of something like this.

Mageblade to mages. 

Choker to mages.

Like it's literally not possible unless a backdoor was written in. One of the primary reasons why people should consider going open soure is things like this. However this is simply just so far fetched. 

Sure you can hide instructions in h264 encoding. But you'd need the decoder to be looking for it on the target system.
