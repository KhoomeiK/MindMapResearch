There are people well in the six figures with blogging - thats the exception, or course

At least it could help you build a good portfolio or networking with publishers along the line if you are willing to work in that environment.

Haro is help a reporter out, meaning there are reporters requesting your feature in areas of expertise for there articles.

So if there's an article about retail for example, you can give your experience and will be featured in this article.

If you like marketing, copywriting could be rewarding for you."

Go ahead, apply for sales, entry doesn't require a degree.

But you will soon enough come back, whining how tough it is.

Go into stocking shelves, construction, factory work.
Oh, thats to hard? Well maybe you are now humble enough to admire a decent degree.

Business majors still pay better than stem, good lawyers will always be ahead, but good luck handling the stiff competition.

Nobody tells you to go into stem, do whatever alignes with your goals, values and lays within your talents.

For communications you can gladly stick with written emails and such, for client communication try mimicing your coworkers, keep it professional and dont be afraid to ask for help.

Also, to avoid future bullying or else from your manager, dont call out any mental illness directly if not necessary instead frame as 'I havr problems with such and such' 'not that social' whatever, point them directly to solutions that would help you instead of soulstripping yourself.

It is like asking your employer to split deadlines to keep you on track for adhd folks, or pointing out an ergonomic workplace would help your productivity (instead of telling about your back problems). 

It could leave you vulnerable, if you disclose yourself at work.

It's actually a healthy and encouraging attitude to be curious and interested in multiple areas!
(especially if you are in your twenties /early thirties, like I guess). 

However these are mocking interview questions.
So if you are unsure, if your study choice leads to a good first impression, my best advice is to put out some bullet points, why this would benefit the company:

the hiring manager doesn't care about your interests, but surely about his boss and what a great steal he got with you for the company! :)
HR to boss:
""shesskatingbackwards is
a women with proficency and interest in the field PLUS bigger picture thinking abilities and courage to expand, proven by law school attendance!"" 

Sounds better than not finishing law school, right? :P"

First, its cool and social to eat in cafeteria with your study buddies and helps you stay in touch with news and friends.

Also, I bet you are not forced to get breakfast or dinner there.

You've gotten in shape, so you surely know good nutrients and meals.

The most convenient way is to get a crock pot and prepare oats for breakfast everyday and potatoes/rice with quality meat for the evening.
Thats what serious college athletes do.

You can also bag healthy snacks like eggs, prepared veggies or fruit for library through the day.

Plain, quality food is cheaper than processed and with clever prep you will always have tasty, good foodchoices at hand (and even share with dormmates or friends comming over).

careerguidance,fegwgi9,t3_ep1n8y,1579104067.0,"Look at it this way - the best way you can invest is learning.

Focus on what you learned in your attendance and how it snowballed your knowledge to another field and when your interests where covered, you choosed to opt back into the workforce.

Interviews are all about selling, so make sure to sell yourself good (eg you have more broad education than somebody with the same master).

Eventually questions on your ""lack of focus /commitment/ success in law/lack of interest in your field"" will come up, but you can put aside any doubt and frame your studies as a bonus, instead."
socialskills,fe99pz4,t3_enlypa,1578935624.0,"First try do play the objective, meaning giving calls to your team if you have Intel.
Your basically feared of judgment most likely - nobody will be pissed about good info.
If there are social people in your team, one will strike conversation naturally.
Dont make casual conversation overcomplicated (easy to say from a distance, I know, hah).
People might actually approach you alot, since woman are still underrepresented in online gaming - just keep it light and don't take horny teenagers to serious eventually :P
There are actually more (vocal) idiots in ego shooter games, those games attract a higher number of such people.

I'm talking especially counter strike, but also met hilarious people there!

But in 90% of conversations you will meet cool people and nobody acts shitty - good example, you posted here out of the blue and everybody reacts with the same kindness you sent out to the internet! :)

So there you have it and even if somebody tries to bully online, its just because of there own feeling of inadequatcity and the same goes for the real world.

careerguidance,fe48ayh,t3_enh06q,1578856725.0,"Vast majority of programming jobs don't require a master, except maybe high competitive finance /Quant jobs.
If you want to take a master, make sure its for the right reason, which might be

A doubling down on a very specific area that you bring high interest in

B you want an academical career

C you want to switch fields to business or such


If you want to hone your skills, you are better of doing your own project and document them via blogging /github etc
If you are looking for a pay rise, change companies often, become 'unfireable' etc - statics show a master isn't necessarily a good financial decision.
However if you are willing to educate yourself more or are a curious person, don't be stopped, its a very personal decision and not necessarily only about a better paycheck."

Persons with psychopathic traits gravitate toward certain roles more, you might want a surgeon whos not so much bothered emotionally when operating literally.
Also leadership roles are sought after by psychopaths, one might argue humanity would benefit without cutthroat capitalism or power hungry politicians.
Its just another spiel of nature, a generic mutation and evolution will erase this trait if it's not survivable any longer.
But in certain situations, psychopaths seem to make more rational decisions and thus prove 'evolution worthy' (remember, its still survival of the fittest) 
According to kevin dutton, you can run brainscans to reveal psychopathic neurodiversity. 
Highly recommend his books btw, they are entertaining at least. 
However, most people with aspd can lead normal life's and blend in well with society, everybody is on a spectrum, somewhat."

The headline reads a bit different then your text - meaning i dont get the impression your persona changed, but your fed up with circumstances and things started affecting you at personal wellbeing.
This means you might not enjoy an introvert job at all (because you are still extraverted), however check out everything technical /computer related,if you'd still like to get into a whole different workplace.

I for example am a technical designer and after meeting and when handling a pressing project, I could literally dig 8h into my pc (excepting some interruptions or client communications).
I can tell you this became daunting to me fast, having little interaction and stuff might kill a bubbly extravert (good friend changed to teaching in college after 2 semesters, admire her lol).

However, if you think your personality didn't changed, but circumstances created stress and bad mood, consider other jobs that are more aimed at extraverts.

There was a reason you went into Healthcare, find it and re - asses.

Maybe think about radiology, less troubled I heard.

Think about elder care, very though after and well respected here (europe).

Dabble into medical sales, much money to be made and given your experience a less dramatic but quite competitive environment.

All the best, make sure to come back and give notice how things went!"
