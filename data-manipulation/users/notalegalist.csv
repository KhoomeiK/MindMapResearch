insaneparents,ff91as5,t1_ff8jxfl,1579702341.0,"My mother used the fact that she sometimes paid for my food and clothing as blackmail for me to accept her abuse. 

My mother said that I had to do ridiculous things for her to love me. 

My mother stole money from me beginning in elementary school and then told me I didn't love her when I asked my dad for necessities. 

My mother expected me to be her parent, therapist, my severely disabled brother's caregiver, and so on from an early age. 

Any gripe from me was met with screaming and crying and emotional manipulation. Her feats of narcissism were and still are absolutely ridiculous. 

I shouldn't meet a particular checklist of ridiculous demands just to have my basic needs met. That's what I mean by unconditional. I wasn't a bad kid. I was beat into respect and submission. My mother basically wanted to bill me for all of the ""sacrifices"" she made for me barely surviving growing up. ""I'm your mother. You have to give me [blah]."" That's what I mean I owe her nothing, I owe her nothing for just doing the bare minimum, I don't owe her for giving birth to me. 

Definitions can be weird, yes, but I mean it in the most basic sense."

insaneparents,ff77592,t1_ff5mccv,1579642447.0,"Bingo bongo, that's when you get the ""respect"" some parents feel like they are entitled to for just doing the minimum amount of effort to keep their kids alive. When in reality, it's a mutually loving relationship between parent and child, and those are pretty nice."
insaneparents,ff76t7u,t1_ff69daa,1579642256.0,"Totally fair. I'm generally a proponent of the ""respect must be earned"" kind of mentality, to varying degrees. Some parents feel as though they are entitled to ""respect"" (i.e., treat me as an authority and I'll treat you as a person) for just being a parent. There's differences in definitions, but where a lot of focus is, especially in this sub, is when parents expect respect or what have you when they have done the minimum of parenting — feeding the child, buying clothes for the child, driving the child to school, etc."
insaneparents,ff6ihy0,t1_ff5gbwe,1579627919.0,"Big mood. Tbh, I made this, because my abusive mother attempted to break my no-contact with her a few days ago by showing up at my house unannounced. I haven't been dealing with it well, but it has absolved me of any of the little guilt I had left. I'm not her, I am so much more than her, and I deserve love the way love should be given."

aww,ff377km,t1_ff333fg,1579535332.0,"Neutering/spaying a dog can *increase* their risk of hip dysplasia, especially before 12 months of age, as the developmental hormones are decreased before fully developed. Neutering can slightly decrease their risk for some cancers, but it can also increase their risk for bone and prostate cancer. 

There are pros and cons to both, but you can't just do a ""simple"" Google search. When researching for *both* sides, you have to vet and judge your sources and studies."
aww,ff32uga,t1_ff3201u,1579532234.0,"I'm generally in the boat of owner decision either waiting until a ""maturity safe"" age or not at all. Personally, with any future dogs I have, I'll opt to keep them intact, unless there is some medical necessity to neuter. So yeah, I definitely agree with you; keeping them intact is better for their overall health. 

I didn't really mention personal views, because I know that can be considered a *spicy* take. If people are going to choose to neuter, it should at least be done when the dog is fully developed."
aww,ff319yl,t1_ff2nocf,1579531008.0,"Yes, but responsibly. Neutering a dog *too early* can be detrimental to their health and negatively impact their skeletal and muscular development, especially in giant, slow-maturing breeds such as the Great Dane shown here."
aww,ff30uzm,t1_ff303q1,1579530676.0,"Idk, I think it's a lot to due with thoughts on irresponsible breeding, some beliefs that keeping a dog intact is bad for their health/prevents a small amount of cancers, practices with shelter dogs, etc. 

This is one of those topics that always has a strong rhetoric around it (similar to ""adopt don't shop"", the service dog/ESA debate, and Pitbull bite statistics)."

I'm still so fucking shaken up. Fuck, I've cried so much over the last day and I have spent so much time in bed just watching videos, because I don't want to leave my room. 

There are still tinges of guilt I feel every once and awhile for cutting ties with her. Nope, nope, not anymore. She's a sadistic witch that deserves no sympathy, because that's exactly what she wants. 

Good on you for starting to yeet that toxicity out of your life! I hope it goes smoothly (ya know, as smoothly as these kinds of things can go...). You only deserve happiness and warmth. Reciprocation of hugs and high fives."

And ew ew, that's so disgusting they did that to you and your son. I don't know what they think these kinds of things will accomplish. It's terrifying, it's creep. I'm so glad your friends were able to help you then. 

I also totally feel you on the nightmare front. Mine subsided for a bit, but I'm scared they're going to come back more after this. I had some bad ones last night. 

Thank you for the reassurance. I have a peephole, thankfully (I just never think to check it, because it's *normally* either maintenance or the bicycle Mormons). I'm going to look into cameras. I need to see if I'm allowed to have them where I live and if it makes sense cost-wise (livin' it up in my student debt)."
raisedbyborderlines,feyd5up,t1_fetd21d,1579444003.0,"That's absolutely horrifying and disgusting. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Honestly? It's a whole 24 hours later, and I'm not doing so hot. I handled it better than I ever thought possible, but I haven't cried this many times in one day in a hot second. I feel on edge in my own home, and I hope, like you said, I'm able to feel safe here again.  

Luckily, I'm gone for a solid part of the days most week days for school, but that's not really a solution to anything. I'm hoping the feelings will go away."

Love it, lmao. My mother did something very similar. I was still under her plan, she never respected my boundaries, I went NC with her, she detonated, started threatening to cut it off and was about to. So I changed over to the non-abusive parent. She emailed me to tell me that she decided not to cancel it because ""she knows what unconditional love looks like"". Literally last message I sent to her was basically ""Hey, you threatened to cancel, so feel free. I got a different phone and number. Peace out."" She went *ballistic*, and it felt so good to shut her down and remove that control. 

I'm glad you're not under her plan any more and it gives you some more breathing space. You ain't got no time for that kinda crazy."

My oldest sibling is also NC with our mother (for slightly different but ultimately similar reasons), and our mother sent him weird presents...he lives in a different country.

I've considered a cease-and-desist letter, but I know anyone can send those, and I'm not sure it would do much, ya know? 

Dude, it seems like my worst fault in all of this is my paranoia/overwhelming curiosity. I get the letters and I think ""Oh no, what kind of awful things did she say this time? What kinds of stunts is she trying now? Oh no, what if she's going to do something bad that affects my brother that still lives with her?"" But it's not ever, ever worth it for my mental health and my safe place. 

My first boyfriend was abusive, and he gave me all these stuffed animals. When I finally got away from him, those stuffed animals just sat in my room, making me feel so unsafe. So I burned them. Me, the pyrophobe, burned those stuffed animals, and it felt so good at the time. It was so relieving, and yeah, cathartic. 

I have no place to start a fire at my current place, and I don't really want to, but maybe just throwing them away can suffice. :)"

So the first one, I had actually put into our recycling box, didn't even want to touch it. But it just sat there, eating away at me, it actually felt like it put pressure in the room. My dog knocked it out of the box, and I ""had"" to read it. Tbh, it might be a paranoia thing, but idk. 

I probably shouldn't read any of the next ones. Who knows what they'll have, but I think that's also scary to me, ya know? But is it worth it? Probably not. Don't need those kinda bad vibes in my safe space. As you kind of suggested, I might just have my partner immediately throw them away. I don't feel comfortable anyone reading those. 

I had a similar thing actually happen to you: My first boyfriend was abusive. I finally had a mental break and dumped him over the phone and didn't contact him again. He emailed me these long sob story angry emails afterwards, and unlike you, I read them. It did awful things to me. It was manipulating me all over again. Ya know, now it feels like in a similar situation with my mother since you mentioned this. Wow, that really just hit hard. The curiosity isn't worth it, you're right. Thank you for this."

When I first cut contact with my mother, I had to block her on every form of communication. When she was super desperate, she tried sending me little bits of money over a money transferring app that let you put small messages on them, things like ""why because you hate me"", just really destructive stuff. I sent that stuff back, man. That was dirty money, even though like you at the time, I really needed it. 

Someone else suggested it, I think I need to follow your example and just stop opening them, have someone else throwing them away. The curiously absolutely consumes me, it's like a weight living there if I don't, but what good will that do me?"
raisedbyborderlines,fd9er6m,t1_fd7dod4,1578232405.0,"That actually is a pretty ingenious idea, I love it. My main concern with doing that, sending a cease-and-desist, etc. is that I feel like at that point, she'll snap again and take it out on my disabled brother who still lives with her or my father who still has to communicate with her to get said disabled brother from time to time. Idk, it might actually be worth it. She'll only use my brother as a pawn to manipulate me, but would never actually hurt him, and my dad would just ignore her otherwise."
