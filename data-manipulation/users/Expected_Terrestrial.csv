Edmonton,feaff8w,t1_feae39p,1578948040.0,"> It’s disgusting coming up with ideas and suggestions to kill a dog.

No.  It’s only disgusting to come up with ideas and suggestions to kill a *healthy* dog.

I see no point in shaming people for doing their best to be merciful to a suffering animal.  Shooting any animal probably isn't the ideal solution for anyone post-Gen-X, but it's certainly not ""sick"" and it did just fine for a few hundred years.  I don't think veterinarians possess some mystical ethical mandate when it comes to ending a pet's suffering.

To me, it seems far more sketchy to charge $300 to $500 for a $6 vial of pentobarbital, an $8 needle & IV interlink, ten minutes of a vet's time, and a $50 disposal fee.  And that's setting aside all the potential upselling, like the ceramic paw prints and the jewelry made from Fido's ashes.  But maybe I'm not woke enough."

Clearly there is, or we wouldn't be discussing it.  If a pet owner euthanizing their dying pet with helium is just as peaceful and painless as paying a vet to start an IV of pentobarbital, then what's the issue?  

By the way, at no time did I recommend shooting the dog, but it's ridiculous to refer to this method as ""sick"" considering that every pet prior to the late 1970s was put down this way.  Sometimes, and particularly in rural Alberta, it just comes down to the most expedient way to quickly end an animal's suffering."
Edmonton,fe9vzux,t1_fe9ldvs,1578941918.0,"Well, you *did* ask for affordable options... and you also floated the idea of your husband just shooting the dog.  Is helium more or less ethical than that?  Well, helium is not only less messy and stressful, but it also eliminates any possibility of causing undue suffering, so I would argue yes.

If you have in fact managed to find an Edmonton vet that will euthanize and dispose of a 100 lb. dog for $100 (with no required exam or hidden fees), I encourage you to promote their clinic here for future Redditors.  Maybe even edit your original question and add it there."
Edmonton,fe8zxli,t1_fe8nbtq,1578932758.0,"> Vets to Go


(FYI: According to a Calgary subreddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/4l1d9k/in_home_pet_euthanization/d3jim6d/) from three years ago, the **Vets to Go** cost for a 27 lb dog was ~$500 for euthanasia and disposal.)"
Edmonton,fe8z0ek,t1_fe8t0hk,1578932446.0,"I wouldn't recommend discharging a firearm within city limits. 

That being said, paying $300 for euthanization (and another $100+ for disposal) is absolutely insane.  Truth be told, you can safely euthanize most pets at home, using a $40 helium tank available at most wedding/party rental stores.  You'll even have leftover helium (and balloons) to throw together a celebratory wake for your beloved pet, if you're into that.

There's an economical pet crematorium in Eastgate Business Park, or a much cheaper option (not to be crass, but it's roughly $1 a pound) if you're willing to drive to Atim Creek Pet Crematory.  Inside the city, the ashes probably go to a landfill.  Outside the city, they get scattered in the fields."
