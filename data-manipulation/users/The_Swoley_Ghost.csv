Sorry for quizzing you on all the details.  I am using a kut-thaka and since that increased my wheelbase by a few inches I've noticed that the CX trucks are way less capable of pumping, so I'm trying to remedy that.  You seem to have found a good fix, so i'm very curious if you might have the solution to fix my setup.    


Did you go with the 10 degrees or the 15 degrres de-wedge in the back?  Right now it takes a lot of effort to pump continuously, to the point where i'd rather just push....."
