Relying on an employee to count, handle and store cash is completely different than relying on an employee to process electronic transactions because of the increased potential for internal theft which, again, has a cost.

The flu has a very low mortality rate, but that rate jumps significantly if you change the sample size from “everyone who’s had the flu” to “people who are hospitalized with the flu” which is what the sample currently is for this strain of the coronavirus. The pool of confirmed cases is disproportionately  drawn from people who presented with the most severe symptoms as they would be the ones to seek treatment.

On charity navigators website they have a 4/4 in the accountability and transparency category, they have a gold star transparency seal of approval, and they check every single box in the 990 information provided category under information and transparency. 

Why are you so attached to this notion that 1 dollar has to exactly equal 1 tree? That’s not how the real world works. If you have $1 it’s very hard for you to plant one tree. If a lot of people pledge one dollar, it gets easier and easier through the consolidation of resources. That’s literally what charitable organizations are, and how they work. The Arbor Day foundation, which specializes in planting trees, is very good at planting trees. They have established an infrastructure that allows them to plant trees efficiently. Whether it’s paying for the expertise of someone to know where to plant what, or buying seeds in bulk, or paying travel, all of these factors contribute to the overall efficiency of the organization. 

You seem to be stuck on this naive notion that the only expenses associated with planting these trees are the literal cost of the seeds and the labor to plant them. In reality, with an organization of this size, the money is used in a variety of ways that contribute to the existence and maintenance of an infrastructure that allow the trees to be planted in the first place."

There is a ton of transparency and accountability.
