BeerHammer,fghqvzn,t3_eykaru,1580791350.0,"Most importantly you need more infantry. You’re gonna need 6 squads total for good board control and screening. So start there. 


Next your going to need two more tank commanders. (With plasma sponsons).

That’s 600ish points.


Then you’ll want some at to artillery pieces to flush out enemies on that back line and deal damage to monsters at range and without LOS. You could easily get 3 basilisks in for the remaining points and still have a bit left over.

I’d fill the rest of the points with astropaths, and a ministorum priest for your bullgryns. 


Tank commander w/ plasma sponsons x 2 = 384

5 infantry squads = 200

3 Basilisks = 324

Ministorum priest = 35

Astropath x 3 = 45


Total = 988


That should get you to a fighting 2000."

Christianity itself is a plague, and Christians are a scourge to the world. How many must die in the name of god? How many US citizens are forced into gay conversion therapy in the name of Jesus?
