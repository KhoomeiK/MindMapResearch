Here's how I would word a longer version though...

Then before you know it, you're in a seedy bathroom stall, freebasing Pepsi, when you look down, and see a pair of clown shoes in front of you.

You'll say ""Who is it?""

Ronald McDonald will open the door and say ""I am the one who knocks.""

Grimace will be behind him and ask ""How's the Pepsi, Bitch?""

And that's when you realize... The Hamburglar was the good guy. He was trying to save us from obesity. He's even got the mask and cape. He's Batman to Ronald's twisted Joker."

StandUpWorkshop,ff80olj,t3_ers5sb,1579662937.0,"Personally, I like this setup with your original punchline. I think saying 'hamburgers are like a gateway drug' gets the punchline across adds the option for fast food taglines (unless you want to build on insulin).

Turns out the Hamburglar is just a really good dude trying to save us from obesity. One hamburger at a time. (change this to play on him being actually being a superhero since he has a mask and cape?)

They literally put in additives that prevent your body from getting sick of the taste of their food. You know if a drug dealer knew how to figure that shit out, they would do the same thing. ODing is bad for business.

McDonald's giving out free toys in happy meals is just them getting kids hooked on their product at an early age.

Ronald McDonald and Burger King look like they're into some heavy drugs. And I know Wendy's doesn't look old enough, but she's got a serious Molly problem."

I'm sure there's more, but those are the ones that I notice myself doing.

StandUpWorkshop,ff57cjf,t3_erobay,1579582349.0,"I think OJ is a pretty well worn topic, so you'd need a really strong punchline and unique take on it. It's going to be hard to do OJ jokes, because they've been around for so long now.

There are memes about how OJ drove a slow white bronco and Peyton Manning is a slow white bronco.

You might be able to do something with the glove thing, but I think it might be hard to to prevent people from seeing the punchline coming.

This is my best attempt at misdirection, but I don't think it's very strong:
Say what you will about OJ, but he was an amazing football player. And according to court documents, he never needed gloves.

Maybe you could tie the two together with a one liner:
When OJ was driving the Bronco, do you think he was wearing driving gloves?

Or: Did you know that the cops only arrested OJ after the highway chase because they found out the driving gloves actually fit?

Everyone will know the glove reference, so I don't think you need too much of a setup (unless it's a young crowd, but they're not going to get the joke anyways)."

StandUpWorkshop,ff2ag1j,t3_er4ee3,1579498658.0,"I see the link between enjoying hobbies on your own vs performing in front of people, but this version sounds a little forced.

You could make a connection between the endorphin rush of being on stage vs masturbating. Like they both give your brain the same drug, but only one activity can be performed in front of people... in most countries at least.

You could also play on the speed of both activities. Masturbating in public needs to be done very quickly, whereas stand up is more like sex where you're trying to stretch out the material to last as long as possible."
StandUpWorkshop,ff28gsb,t3_er3fo7,1579496866.0,"Maybe re-frame it to talk about how your/their parents talked about safe sex, and how this technically counts as safe sex? My punchline needs some work, but maybe you can do something with it:

As a teenager, my parents always harped on me about having safe sex, but they never walked me through what that actually meant. We never really had the talk, they just said be safe.

I think that is what the foot fetish porn category is all about. Horny kids, all over the world, had to find ways to be sexual without getting pregnant or contracting diseases, so they started sucking on toes (scraping nail polish).

I'm not a fan of that category, but it makes me worry about whether you can get athlete's foot in your mouth. Is there an STD test for that?"

I remember having an imaginary friend too when I was a kid. All the other kids were doing it at the time, so I gave into peer pressure and tried to find one. 

Mine was a little different though. He was a 43 year old alcoholic with a head wound. He was really surprised when I started talking to him. He said I was the only one who could see him, so I knew he had to be an imaginary friend. We had the best time pickpocketing people and stealing cars.

I was arrested for driving erotically last week.

I was stuck in traffic and the woman in front of me had a ""Honk if you're horny"" bumper sticker.

So I honked. A police officer comes out of nowhere and starts yelling at me: ""Lemme see your hands! Lemme see your hands!""

It might be possible to write a script like this, but I find it bad taste to rip off so much of the core story and just say it's ""inspired by"". It's just a re-imagination of the original film in my mind.

The book/movies my script references are about a decade prior to IAMMMMW, so they aren't in the public domain.

My script will just be a good portfolio script, so I'm not looking to change it so that it's not an adaptation.

If you can, definitely try finding a therapist that you like. It really helps to have a sounding board that you can trust. Someone who is knowledgeable about coping with different types of anxieties.

You also might need to see a couple different therapists to find the right fit, so don't get discouraged. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find a therapist that is knowledgeable, friendly, and communicates well.

It's completely worth it to push through and find the right one though. They can help you target what you need to focus on and make working through things a lot easier."
mentalhealth,fctw4en,t3_eiwp44,1577962564.0,"Do you see a therapist and/or pysch doctor? Medication and professional therapy helped me the most. I did my best to manage anxiety on my own, but it was too much to handle by myself. The was/is no amount of self-will that allows me to fully calm my mind.

One small thing that helped me a little is repeating a mantra in my head. I actually started it after watching the movie What About Bob? Bill Murray constantly repeats to himself ""I am good. I am great. I am wonderful."" I have to repeat it many times until I feel the words sink in and it calms me.

And since DBT is all about staying in the present, I sometimes change the mantra to use variations with the past/present/future tenses: ""I was ok. I am ok. I will be ok.""

Definitely talk to a professional if you aren't already. One of my biggest regrets in life is not doing so sooner. It would have saved me MANY years of pain."
