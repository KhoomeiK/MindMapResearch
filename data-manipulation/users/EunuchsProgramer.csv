But, the criticism I heard of him was that he had Alex Jones on, and let Alex Jones spew a bunch of Sandy Hook conspiracy theory crap for a few hours without much push back.  Then, according to the Sand Hook parents, they got a big uptick in of death threats... Then, Rogan invited Jones for a second time on his show once again still without challenging him. 

Basically, the argument is some people are truly vile, like Alex Jones. Their message harms innocent people, like the Sandy Hook parents. It's irresponsible to amplify their message."

worldnews,ffgn1fa,t1_fffuk53,1579910044.0,"For a long time, for a large segment of Republican voters, the top issue has been basically there are too many immigrants here and the country is changing too fast. They'd get primary candidates willing to throw them dog whistles and send winks that they'd stop/limit immigration and/or deport all the illegals in the primary. The standard ritual was to go to a Southern, private, University (not bound by Civil Rights laws) that openly discriminated against minorities and give a speech on ""States"" rights. Typical ""moderate"" Republican presidential candidates giving a wink to racism since Reagan.  

Republican voters would then find, every time, once ""their"" guy won the primary, he'd flip and go full, ""I love diversity let's do an amnesty deal."" The loyalty to Trump is finally getting a candidate who stayed with them and didn't treat them like an embarrassment post primary."
