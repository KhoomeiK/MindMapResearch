Lucas and Spielberg are friends and collaborators, they worked together on a bunch of stuff (such as Indiana Jones); of course they were cool with the other making these jokes/references. To generalize it by saying that because these two guys were friends, directors used to be more friendly is a bit absurd."

Or else it'll be situations where the value in the exponent is exact, as in someting^(3) or something^(1/2) . Off hand I can't think of an equation that works like in your question where both the base and the exponent are measured values, if one did come up then both would matter; I would answer  12.576^(1.2/.000673) with two sig figs, not five."

In other words the compass is ignored. It's more like a visual list of instructions, turn right here, pass this city, etc. The one I link is of the Mississippi river, which obviously is not straight, but you can see how it would still be helpful to navigate the river. These maps, then, are for routes rather than places. The Iter Avto presumably doesn't know if you turned, it just assumes you've stayed on the route."
explainlikeimfive,fek1ba9,t1_fejx6wc,1579190483.0,"Some radioisotope dating does work that way. Carbon 14, for example, is produced by nuclear reactions in the upper atmosphere, keeping the ratio of 12C and 14C in the atmosphere more or less constant. Living things have the same carbon ratio as the atmosphere because they are constantly consuming carbon that comes ultimately from the atmosphere, but when they die the ratio begins to change. By measuring the ratio (and knowing the original ratio) we can determine age."

The unit of extinction coefficients is usually given as M^(-1)cm^(-1) so it *must* be independent of path length (and concentration). Since the extinction is ""per cm"" it doesn't matter if you have one cm or a thousand because the extinction coefficient describes how much absorption you'll get for each cm of pathlength; that's what the cm^(-1) tells us."

chemhelp,fdpspaz,t3_emm7p4,1578638984.0,"Absorbance. At low pH, HIn >> In- and absorbance is 0, at high pH In- >> HIn and absorbance is max. From this we conclude that HIn does not absorb at 590 nm and can get the extinction coefficient of In- by assuming the indicator is 100% protonated at pH 10. Knowing the extinction coefficient of In- we can determine its concentration at any pH using Beer's Law. Once we know the concentration of In- we also know the concentration of HIn and can calculate the ratio."
