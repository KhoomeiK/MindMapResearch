AskReddit,ffajy3o,t1_ffac88q,1579737598.0,"I think my own use stems from 2 places.

The first use stems from playing games online. When you die, it usually gives the enemy advantages. If you took enough resources or got kills on your way out, you'd yell something like ""worth it!"". Overtime, this evolved into a joke where you shout ""Worth!"" whenever you basically give up a free kill due to your own stupidity. Over the years, (this was a thing since like ~2013 in my online gaming circle) ""worth"" has pretty much completely taken on this meaning in my regular dialog.

My second use is used regarding online sales. Someone posts a good deal on something you've been looking at but you're not sure you want to splurge on? You ask ""Worth?"" And people will tell you some more details if they know. Also, a common response on a really good deal is ""This is it, chief"".

Trump lowers business costs through tax reform = no benefits to the consumer. Just making rich companies richer by increasing profits.

Trump raises business costs through tariffs = the consumer is getting fucked. Businesses are going to pass that cost onto the consumer so it won't effect profits.

There's no winning here. It's rigged. That's when I started questioning everything. I also like to ask myself ""If Trump did the opposite just now, how could I spin this to still be bad?"" Turns out, it's really, really easy. Thats when I became waaaaay more moderate than I once was."
