Out of all the scientists in the relate fields, ~97% agree that man impacts climate change in a noticeable way.  Guess who the other 3% work for?  And while some of the 97% MAY profit off creating a scare, for the vast majority they get paid for their work regardless of the findings, and have no incentive to risk their career/reputation on a lie.

Turns out even the gas companies leadership knew about climate change in the 80s, they just hid it from the public.
