\*sigh\* son, you don't see shit.

The triple AAA games are scam because the effort put into them doesn't add value and most of the money made from them doesn't go into more development, it goes into investor and executive pockets.

It's the same reason I think Harley-Davidson bikes are a scam: They're decent bikes but aren't worth they money charged for them and sales are driven largely by the culture surrounding them.

Yes, games cost millions of dollars to make, and if you sell enough at $40 per, you make your money back and then some. There's nothing magical about a $60 price point that suddenly makes the millions worth it. Coke costs millions of dollars to make. I expect to pay 75 cents for a can because I know how many get sold.

I even said micro-transactions are fine as an alternative to traditional game sales, but they have to be used responsibly. And, again if believe:

> Microtransactions are the single best thing to happen to the videogame industry in decades.

Without qualification, you really need to re-examine your value system. They are good, but like so many other forces of progress they're also damaging to the industry when not implemented responsibly. That money isn't going where you seem to think it is."

Wow. You sincerely believe that? Because reality and economics totally contradict that. There are plenty of profitable small and medium sized developers that charge under $50 for games. 

Triple A games are a total scam. The bloat and waste that goes into those games is what makes those games expensive, not to mention the multibillion dollar executive salaries and dividends that go to investors. Besides, most triple A games already cost in excess of $100 with season passes and \*also have mtx\*. If what you're claiming about the scaling were true, then the triple A games would be cheaper than indy titles and double A games because the scale would allow them to undercut the Indies with a better quality. 

If you think that's the dichotomy of choice F2P games with abusive mtx or nothing but $100+ triple A games, I don't know what to tell you other than get your medication adjusted. There are tons of great indy games and double A games that are developed on a budget, sell well, don't have mtx, and didn't need to be subsidized by mtx. 

Because it needs to be said again, triple A games are so expensive because the publishers (mostly) and developers (to a lesser extent) have fucked themselves with ludicrous promises to gamers and investors over the last 15-20 years.

I won't argue if a game wants to go free-to-play, they have to make money via other streams, be it micro-transactions, premium features, or selling ads. I never really played F2P games much, and their practices have become so abusive I won't anymore."

Currently, *lots* of the UK's housing is heated with natural gas. Mixing 20% H2 gas into the *existing* natural gas infrastructure should reduce CO2 emissions with virtually no modification of the system. Only a injection system at the source would be needed, all the distant pipework remains intact. The distribution network exists.

Also, its only being done at one University right now. That scale is simple. It's just proof of concept.

It has nothing to do with cars. Its about heating homes and cooking food. According to the article, burning gas for heating is responsible for \~ 1/3 of the UK's carbon emissions. So, 20% of 33% is \~ 6% of total. Not major, but more than nothing.

Long-term storage of hydrogen (more than several days) is a problem. Short-term (overnight) is not. This amount of hydrogen can be synthesized daily *de novo* without much trouble.

To make a the whole system work, you're right that it would need lots of hydrogen, but we're not at that step in the project. This is the starting point. You have to move through this transition for industry to mature, and this project will provide critical industrial knowledge as we move towards a hydrogen economy and away from a hydrocarbon economy. Compare this to nuclear power, when we had to build shitty Gen I BWRs to learn how to build slightly less shitty Gen II PWRs. 

Massive private capital might not be interested, but there's lots of venture capital interested in hydrogen tech, and again, this will produce vital practical knowledge for that industry.

Ultimately, though, this is a band-aid. Long term (decades to centuries) the UK, and basically everywhere else, needs to move away from burning fossil fuels for heat. That very well may require new infrastructure (improved electricity distribution).

Greyhounds,fcuhj5v,t1_fcu2hv8,1577981103.0,"I had no idea Australia had BSL for greyhounds or that they were considered an 'aggressive' breed. They  shouldn't be let off leash in open areas, but not letting them run free in dog parks is absolutely awful."
technology,fcuh2er,t1_fcugc9o,1577980787.0,"I don't think this is a ""simple problem."" Long-term hydrogen storage (albeit liquid) has been a long-sought solution for fuel storage in spaceflight applications.

Basically, NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, China, and their collective public and private academic institutions haven't solved it yet. I don't think it qualifies as ""simple."""
technology,fcug790,t1_fcuckg4,1577980196.0,"I dont think it's less bulky than hydrocarbons, and hydrogen tends to diffuse out of containers so long term storage is challenging compared to natural gas."
technology,fcufx38,t1_fcudd0f,1577980001.0,"The idea *should* be to use renewvale energy (e.g., wind or solar) to produce hydrogen from water.
 
My understanding is that currently most industrial hydrogen gas is produced by ""steam reforming"" natural gas. Obviously, that shouldn't be used for this project."

atheism,fcty49y,t3_eiuexq,1577965344.0,"> The leader of Washington’s House Republicans JT Wilcox called Shea’s participation in this chat “deeply upsetting,” and promised that “My conversations with Matt and the leadership will continue.” But Wilcox did not feel that Shea’s actions required his expulsion from government.

The continuing 'conversations with Matt': ""Please stop saying the quiet part out loud."""
Fallout,fctahea,t1_fct8571,1577937287.0,"I suspect this is coming down the pipe. After Shitshow 76 and the acclaim Outer Worlds garnered, I don't think Bethesda is going to do shit with that IP, but Zenimax won't leave it idle.

Solution: third party dev. Just like EA, Respawn and Star Wars."
Fallout,fct9h4h,t3_eiosr1,1577936470.0,"After the way they wrecked Fallout 76, I don't think I'd trust another Bethesda project, even a remaster. Hell, especially a remaster at this point. These old game engines need to die."
