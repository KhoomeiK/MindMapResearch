Take her to an art supply store and buy her some TOP quality materials. Not the kid stuff, not the cheap set. It’s so much easier to learn with professional grade materials; the kid/cheap stuff makes it much more difficult and frustrating. Invest upfront, by giving her access to the ACTUAL materials she needs to learn how to use and how they handle. 

ONE NOTE OF CAUTION: 
Study the safety precautions and proper handling - oil paints, pigments, and mediums can be especially toxic.  Watch out for anything that produces a fine dust. This is also invaluable to learn at an early age as well."
