Around then it would slowly start melting and by April there would still be snowbanks on the ground. Doesn't really happen anymore tho.

I don't think this game should ever be viewed as a responsibility and you definitely shouldn't have to access anything OUTSIDE of playing the game to understand the game characters. Maybe the meta, or the complex nuances? Sure. But what a character DOES should never ever be something you have to RESEARCH as an obligation to play the game."

LivestreamFail,fgerobm,t1_fgejvzh,1580707647.0,"I had started to experience weird visual things in my vision after years of on/off recreational usage (molly for a while and then a long time of only weed). I thought it was something wrong with my eyes so I went to multiple doctors expecting I was going to go blind. The doctors said nothing was wrong, and even sent me to a Corneal Specialist that was highly rated. He told me that my eyes were incredibly healthy. He told me it was possibly ""visual migraines"" and that it would come and go, but I told him it was a constant 24/7 thing and he looked kinda nervous and told me to go see a neurological specialist.

I'm beginning to suspect I am neurologically damaged in an unfixable way. But it's been like this for a year now almost exactly. I constantly feel like I'm seeing something out of the corner of my eye and I go to look and there's nothing there. Stuff floats across my vision.

I didn't go to a doctor because I didn't think there's anything anyone could do and honestly I've never told anyone the full extent of it.

It started one day when I walked outside and it was blanketed in snow and I could see stuff everywhere that wasn't real just floating around. A year later it's still there but you kinda just get used to it. But it can still scare me from time to time especially if I see movement out of my eyes.

IMO it's a similar condition to HPPD. And I definitely think it comes from actual brain-damage which can definitely happen from ONE time.

  
Don't let others tell you what you are or not experiencing, as someone who relates it's weird. Like you said most of the time your life is just normal."

You're in for a much longer rocky life if you think lawsuits do fuck all against private people. They're way better against large companies. Judge Judy isn't real life.

And you're not guaranteed to win in court no matter WHAT you claim. Also there's still legal fees at work that you usually have to pay up front. And honestly even if you win you might never see a dime, and now you have REAL problems with your landlord.

Nah dude, sometimes you need to learn when to hold em, and when to fold em. I don't know what this case is because I'm not OP I don't know their lives, I don't know their circumstances.

GetMotivated,fg74a0f,t1_fg6nue5,1580583649.0,"Tbh, it doesn't really matter how much you game, as long as you're balancing it out equally. You can do 6 hour sessions. Or even play for 24 hours straight. The important thing is to make sure it's not the ONLY thing you're doing. Go to the gym, go hang out with friends. It's fine to make video games your passion/hobby and do them as much as you enjoy them.

&#x200B;

I think the real issue is most people end up NOT being happy doing these things. If you're happy, like genuinely happy playing video games a lot. It's fine to do that. It's only when it's all you do 24/7 AND you're clearly miserable, that it's a real issue. I play video games for the majority of my free time. It's a social outlet for me and I spend a lot of time with friends doing it.

&#x200B;

But I've always actively had other hobbies that I engage in whenever I'm not playing games or taking care of responsibilities. I have my cats, I like card tricks, playing guitar, photography, working on cars, biking, etc etc. I have many many things I enjoy outside of video games even tho they are my primary hobby. But it is absolutely something you have to balance out with other parts of life.

Subsequently if you're a competitive player like me, balancing out your life is usually better for your skill anyway. You learn and grow as a person which helps you in every area of your life."

todayilearned,fg4ceth,t1_fg486n6,1580500781.0,Yes. After my appendix was removed I started gaining weight within weeks lol. My whole life I was < 150 and now I'm almost 160. It happened FAST too. And it wasn't just cause I was being inactive. I'm always on/off for activity and a couple weeks of downtime was nothing new. Especially since it wasn't even summer.

pcmasterrace,fg2nzv6,t1_fg263km,1580449458.0,How does that sub fit. That's for stuff you can't remember the name of but know you know it. This guy said he didn't even know the name of it lol

We're still friends and sometimes I get the urge to just randomly apologize for it, cause I truly didn't realize how oppressive wanting to be together 24/7 could be. It's just bad for both parties. It's usually a sign of codependency as well which is unhealthy as well."

no really. A lot of people are depressed and don't actively try to do anything about it. It's an illness like anything, you need to treat it to get better."

toptalent,ffxbjmy,t1_ffx7rmv,1580321774.0,"I love watching Nardwuar for that reason. There's a lot of mainstream people that always seem like they just got randomly famous, but then he interviews them and you see how hard they worked and how deeply involved they were in the music even from a young age. People like Lil Wayne and shit. It really makes you understand that it couldn't have just been any other artist. That these guys earned their spots."
