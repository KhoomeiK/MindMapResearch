FundieSnark,ffag3fc,t1_ff9y8ng,1579734934.0,"The way I see it, moral wrongdoing = something that hurts a sentient being or makes the world a worse place, and sin = anything that brings you away from the purity of God.

So if you're trying to be a moral person, there's absolutely nothing with swearing when you're alone or with people who don't find that uncomfortable, but it is wrong if you do make people uncomfortable, or the situation is otherwise inappropriate for it.

But if you're trying to avoid sin, even thinking a swear is wrong. God wouldn't want you to do that because it's impure.

I try my best to be a moral person. I have no desire to avoid sin, unless the sin is also morally wrong."
FundieSnark,ff9ra98,t1_ff7620s,1579719354.0,"I mean, part of the reason I wouldn't want to be Christian is because I'm not very... Christian. Sorry, I want to be gay, consume horror, and play cards against humanity without berating myself for it. 

Plus, I have bad thoughts, and why would I want to think that the all-powerful controller of the universe is judging every last one of them when it's so much more comforting to think that so long as I don't hurt anyone and am trying to unlearn problematic mindsets, it doesn't really make me a bad person. 

So yeah, I do want to sin and that does turn me off of Christianity. I might not be a model atheist, but there it is."
BendyAndTheInkMachine,fery6tw,t3_eqcg54,1579359539.0,"Well, you're making two interesting assertions here. I'll go through them one by one.

1) Lost ones are most likely what happens when a human is corrupted by ink for too long. That explains why they're humanlike- they were never intended on being anything but. That's why Sammy became a lost one after ingesting ink, even though he's most often the one who does the sacrificing.

2)Sammy is massively delusional about the intentions and capabilities of the ink demon. In-game, he believes it can and will save him from the ink. In-game, he also offers up Henry as a sacrifice, but Bendy doesn't go for it then, either. Bendy is either a) a mindless predator, or b) sentient, but not a creature who cares for human sacrifices.

These were interesting ideas and not ones that I've ever heard before, even if I do disagree. Thanks for sharing."

Of course, that doesn't really work if you think that Tom and Allison are dead. (And I do. Dreamfisher actually explained this to me and it's such a simple, Occum's razor explanation that it's a miracle neither of us ever came up with it.)"

I've always wondered what was different about the coffin characters. Perhaps they're the people that Joey a) killed while the studio was around and b) Joey personally wanted dead (everyone else was just, I wanted cartoons, and you were there, having a soul. Or, I know nothing about you, but you had evidence that I wanted to hide away.)"
BendyAndTheInkMachine,fe2m29q,t1_fe1xuij,1578840331.0,"Well, two good questions to ask are a) how she was created and by whom, and b) how the cartoon character she was based upon fits into the cartoon."

fatlogic,fdldmix,t1_fdl56p0,1578521770.0,It seems very nihilistic.
BendyAndTheInkMachine,fdj0236,t1_fdip1vw,1578455027.0,"Firstly, I'm flattered that you looked into it that deeply!

Norman and Grant’s friendship does not have the dynamic you described. While yes, Grant is very neurotic, he also fits into society a hell of a lot better than Norman. They both have their issues, and they’re pretty much equal. The reason why Grant doesn’t try to comfort Norman after his worst memory is because he knows that Norman hates being the center of attention and wouldn’t want one more person fussing over him. He gives him an opportunity to talk about it just between the two of them instead, because that’s the kind of support that Norman would find useful. Meanwhile Grant wanted reassurance that he was still respected, and that’s what Norman gave him. This fic wasn't the place to go into their relationship or make that obvious, but I thought it would be good characterization to make them act like they know each other intimately.

Allison is kind of a big sister to Susie, yes, but consider that she’s at a very vulnerable time in her life because of her recent transformation. Had their friendship come at a different time, it would be more equal. (Although Allison is quite a bit more stable/secure than Susie in general.)

I don’t really get what you’re talking about with Sammy and Jack. All the fic does is mention that Sammy knows what Jack’s house looks like. Anyhow, both have their vulnerabilities and strengths.

I don’t get what you’re talking about with Bertrum and Lacie, either. I see them as basically acting like a bickering old married couple and the story barely included any interaction between them beyond Lacie teasing Bertrum.

Henry and Joey definitely had the dynamic you mentioned. Henry was barely out of his parents’ house when they met and Joey had plenty of experience being an adult, plus a boatload of charm. I think given the circumstances, that dynamic is only realistic. Plus, Joey seems like the kind of person who would love to be idolized. If they were to rekindle their friendship now that Henry is older, wiser, and more self-assured, he’d be the big brother friend to Joey if anything.

Sorry for the long comment."

I hope chapter 4 wasn't too much. There are characters that I don't like characterizing and I'm sure no one else wants me to see me struggle with, and there's characters I love and know others love seeing as well, but I think Norman is the only one I like more than is good for me.

BendyAndTheInkMachine,fc39rim,t1_fc2hu86,1577384903.0,"I agree with DuskEalain, mostly. However, DCTL revealed that Buddy, after his transformation, was sharing a body with the consciousness of Boris the Wolf himself. It seems likely that many if not all (aside from Bendy, of course) living cartoons are the same way: a human and a cartoon character sharing a body. They probably have different levels of control and cooperation depending on the individual, however.

Adobe Outdesign actually has a really interesting alternate theory on this: that the deep voice is Alice and the high voice is Susie. Susie's voice is much closer to the high voice, and as DuskEalain said, she isn't evil at all. I could try to find a link for you if you wanted."
