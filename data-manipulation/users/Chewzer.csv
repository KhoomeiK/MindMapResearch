cars,ff31w7i,t1_ff2pyjs,1579531504.0,"This engine really surprised me. My gf at the time wanted me to get rid of my WRX, I was willing to do it as long as the next car wasn't ridiculously boring to drive. I found a mint condition 2012 Civic Si, I took it for a test drive and it turns out the damn thing was faster than my WRX. Left the dealership with it that day and still daily it years later."

Doom,feiszvg,t1_feisqof,1579146429.0,I went with the RST gold on both the outer and inner lens. After seeing how the RST blue looks on yours I think I'm going to order that one for this next season.
Doom,feij44j,t1_fei9pwa,1579139713.0,"It's such a badass a helmet, I bought it way before I even got into motorcycles. Most people I run into call it a Master Chief helmet but I was aiming for Doom Slayer. https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/icon-airflite-battlescar-2-helmet"
wholesomememes,fedw257,t1_fedk0fg,1579021100.0,One of my best buddies just started dating a girl after being single for damn near a decade. Seeing him go from cold and jaded to happy and chipper is so damn awesome.

AskMen,fdm7ad9,t1_fdl66fd,1578541547.0,"When I started I was traveling to different colleges teaching basic 3d modeling and animation. Then one day the college I used to attend called me and asked if I'd be willing to come work for them as a teacher/3d artist. Me not wanting to work in the games/movie industry I jumped at the opportunity.

It's honestly really hard to find these types of positions though because the people making the job postings have no clue what it is we do 90% of the time. The job posting I applied for to be a 3d modeler and animator was something like ""IT Programmer and CAD Designer"". Most of the job offers I've gotten came from my LinkedIn and just knowing people in lots of industries.

I would look into medical universities though, that's where I've had some banger job offers. Damn near every medical school wants to be the next John's Hopkins and they think AR/VR is the key. 

Hopefully this helps a little, good luck!"

The guy you're talking about sat down and started chatting and asking why we gave them a shot. Next thing you know we're hanging out there all the time years later eating and drinking for free because that dude was the owner."

todayilearned,fc5pgee,t1_fc5nh12,1577463184.0,It's such an odd car following. I was part of the WRX crowd but we had monthly meets were all Subaru owners were welcome. It was such a wholesome and fun gathering. [It's a good cult!](https://youtu.be/_e5IgRYBq58)

AskMen,fbvllhl,t1_fbvhxux,1577132570.0,I would recommend a knife over a gun anyway. Most situations a knife is far more beneficial than a firearm. That and if I have to carry an additional item on me it may as well be something that's multipurpose.
