I tried doing some other music but YouTube wouldnâ€™t let it play due to copyright BS. This is just part of a song by The Crystal Method. Itâ€™s from their Vegas release.

One of the motor mounts was torn and the guy helping me suggested those motor mounts plus new diff mounts. I wish I had just gotten the Mazdaspeed mounts.

I got a bunch of grief from the guys at Miata.net about not needing the coolant relocate that I didnâ€™t do it.
