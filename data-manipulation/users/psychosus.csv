truelesbians,ffcx5pd,t3_es4s4v,1579809116.0,I am more annoyed by NB people who don't identify with a gender but dress and act in the manner of their biological sex. If you're a woman and you're NB then why the fuck are you dating a man and dress obviously like a woman. What gender roles are you not following that you can't identify as what you're presenting?

We aren't going to have a perfect candidate as Democrats that will galvanize our entire voting Bloc the way Republicans use spite, so splitting us up is fairly easy. We're not willing to compromise our morals for a candidate - but we should be doing it just to get a foothold back in Congress.
