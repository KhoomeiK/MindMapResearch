dankmemes,ffq3y19,t1_ffpchw7,1580119118.0,this is the real issue. coming in ten minutes before close for a beer and a quick bite? easy. no problem. coming in ten minutes until close and hanging out for two hours? bruh
reactivedogs,ffmmins,t3_eu7m6t,1580056703.0,"agility is great. it’s mentally tiring and my girl is definitely proud of herself after every task. but i’d say the biggest help for me has been hikes on a long lead- it has really changed my dog’s behavior a lot. she gets to explore, sniff, run around, practice recall. we go to a trail 4-5 times a week. if i let her burn off some energy and excitement on a hike and then we walk around my neighborhood, she is much calmer and less skittish. she has a serious case of stranger danger and my neighborhood is fairly busy.

i haven’t really done any sort of official nose work practice, but we do a lot of “go find” type games. she’s a lab/gsd mix and her nose is always on the ground as is."

hopefully OP’s relationship can get past this, just not a dynamic i personally would bring to a relationship. they take enough work without one person being indebted to the other."
AmItheAsshole,ffje8i8,t1_ffjc353,1579996410.0,"because even if you’re very well off, loaning money just adds such a weird, shitty dynamic to any relationship... as evidenced by this post."
AmItheAsshole,ffjaj0c,t1_ffja0zl,1579994252.0,"it’s okay to feel the way you feel. we all have feelings that aren’t exactly logical or rational sometimes. but i don’t know man, it still seems like a pretty dick move to both of these people in your life, so it’s worth some reflection about."
AmItheAsshole,ffj9q2u,t3_ety61l,1579993737.0,"YTA. i studied abroad in france when i was in college. it was exhausting. there’s schoolwork to be done, classes to go to, things to see, papers to write, and planned activities- it’s not just run around the country doing whatever you want. it’s usually very regimented. she is probably trying to squeeze as much as she can in because she may not get another opportunity like this. i don’t know where you’re located either, but if there’s a time difference- that makes everything ten times more difficult to coordinate. when i was studying abroad i barely spoke to my family because they were sleeping when i had free time and i was falling asleep when they were free. it’s tough. 

she’ll be back soon. don’t make her feel bad for doing something that’s a really beautiful opportunity for her."
AmItheAsshole,ffj94rp,t1_ffj8q5t,1579993366.0,"can you gather *why* it makes you uncomfortable? 

presumably this artist is local, right? and has tattooed people other than you? there are other people who already walk around with your artist’s tattoos. does that make you uncomfortable?"
AmItheAsshole,ffj8qff,t3_ety1qk,1579993116.0,"YTA. first, your wife is not your property. she was comfortable with it and can probably handle herself when she is uncomfortable me. i get why it might not be your favorite thing, but it’s really not a big deal at all, and you shouldn’t make it one.

i have shared a hotel room with my heterosexual best guy friend and similar things have happened because there was only one bathroom. we’re adults who don’t want to bang each other, so.... it’s a non-issue."
AmItheAsshole,ffj842d,t3_etxpu3,1579992732.0,"YTA. if it was your birthday, fine. but it’s your mom’s day and if she’s acting like you ruined the night it’s probably because you did ruin it for her."
AmItheAsshole,ffj7veg,t3_etxtaq,1579992578.0,"YTA, to both your friend and your artist. one is missing out on potential business and the other you are denying the benefit of your experience for no rational reason."

AmItheAsshole,ffdur69,t3_et2tjk,1579829423.0,"ESH. he definitely could have supported you better and found a better balance between his activities and you, but if you want a relationship to work you can’t just tear into someone’s character for forty minutes straight. you need to be able to communicate your needs without being nasty. if he really is that selfish and lazy, it’s time to re-evaluate why you’re with him. but if he’s a generally good guy who messed up and you lashed out in frustration, try to avoid personal attacks. you are understandably stressed, but there is a “nice” way to fight."
reactivedogs,ffdng55,t3_esyifc,1579824609.0,"My dog does terribly with any drug that has any sort of sedative effect. I think it honestly makes her more upset because she can feel her body not responding normally and freaks out because she feels even more defenseles. it makes sense because if I was slipped something sedative without actually knowing I took it I would probably freak out too. i wouldn’t sweat it. shit happens, and now you know."
dogs,ffbuk22,t1_ffbqelc,1579783244.0,this! just keep your dog from messing with it as much as possible. my dog had one left in when she had acute pancreatitis so she could get more fluids the next day if needed. they wrapped it gently in a bandage and i kept a cone on her to keep her from trying to mess with it.

OSHA,ffaqsu7,t3_eshars,1579742319.0,it was very common to steal and play with the fire extinguishers when i was in high school. perhaps that was what kept happening here and they stopped replacing them?

dogs,ffak8x1,t1_ff9dpu8,1579737815.0,"this. my dog came with a lot of behavioral problems from an abuse/neglect situation. she’s good with dogs, but she was very fear aggressive toward people at first. i used a vet that had incredible protocol for dealing with her- entering and leaving through a back door and clearing any area they needed her in, using large red flags to warn and transport her. i muzzled her constantly, kept her on two leashes, one attached to a harness and one a collar- as well as carrying a back up muzzle, leash, harness and collar in case anything broke. it was a lot of work and required being very meticulous in my planning. but she never had a chance to bite, ever. 

with a crapload of training, obscene amounts of exercise, and repeated positive experiences with people, she is a big, friendly doofus whose main method attack is slobber.

in situations like this, it’s best for a veterinary behaviorist to evaluate the dog and determine a plan of action- it’s really not something internet strangers can properly assess."

dogs,ff9k1gt,t3_es6wjv,1579714654.0,i bathe my dog once a week because she goes to work in a dirty warehouse with me and is very fond of mud puddles. i use a leave in conditioner after shampooing to avoid her skin from getting too dry.
dogs,ff9jpk3,t3_esc0uv,1579714456.0,ACV may take some of the itch out (humans often use it for eczema and psoriasis) but it’s in no way a cure. your vet should be able to point you to a treatment plan that is more effective.
dogs,ff5nthf,t1_ff5cht3,1579602273.0,"“no” is a confusing, non-specific command for a dog. punishing a reactive dog for reactive behavior, depending on the source of reactivity, can actually be incredibly detrimental to the animal and further cause reactivity and behavioral issues. 

if the dog’s barking is out of fear, the last thing you want is any sort of negative association with the things it’s barking at. you also never want to train a fearful dog out of it’s warning signs- that’s how you get a dog who, when uncomfortable, will not show signs and instead just snap. if a dog is telling you it is uncomfortable, you need to listen. simply training a dog not to bark or growl will not change the fact that it’s uncomfortable. 

if the dog is barking because it’s excited, instead of saying “no” (which again, is a confusing, non-specific command) a good way of teaching it’s behavior is not acceptable is by moving away from the trigger. they see the dog and want the dog. if you bark or pull towards the dog, we go the other way. if you behave calmly and quietly, we can continue looking at the dog. in this case there is a “punishment” and “reward”, but specific to this behavior. 

you are not training “no, don’t bark” in this instance. you are training the dog to react calmly and confidently around its triggers. teaching specific commands like “leave it”, “sit” “look at me” “quiet” are much more effective than “no”. they teach a specific behavior and are not being used punitively."

povertyfinance,ff3syij,t1_ff2v82f,1579548177.0,"it depends where you are. a lot of cities are really lacking in public transportation. what takes me 30 mins to drive would take hours on my city bus. the stops are very far apart and there aren’t many buses to begin with. we got trains recently, but they only run certain hours of the day and are yet to branch out and offer more routes. i’m very jealous when i visit other countries and can hop on a bus or train easily."
