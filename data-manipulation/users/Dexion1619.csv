Handed over my badge and cleaned out my desk.  Losing your first real job sucks, but being able to look at yourself in the mirror is worth it.  Not gonna lie, dropping that during an interview sure as hell impressed people

AmItheAsshole,fffupt9,t3_etddwo,1579892208.0,"YTA.  I have been in this guys shoes, having a sick kid in the hospital and having to juggle that and work.  Fortunately my boss wasn't a monster,  and now I'm one of the most dedicated and productive people they have."

You say you don't feel responsible for his actions,  that fine, do it to protect yourself.  By Semiautomatic Firearm I'm assuming you mean a Rifle?

In addition,  this reads like a really unhealthy environment.  Before someone jumps down my neck about that... Reverse the genders here, and have it be the Husband that storms out of the bedroom, kicks the Girls out, punishes the (Step) Daughter and then blows up at the Wife with the old ""My House My Rules!""

I despise HOA's and busy body's, but Plastic film on the windows instead of curtains definitely sounds terrible.  Not every house needs to be a Home and Garden contender, and I can understand wanting a natural look, but it's not unreasonable to expect the new neighbors to cut the grass, trim the hedges and keep things orderly. Just because you got the property at Fire-Sale prices, doesn't mean you should leave it run down.  If the other houses on your street are going for $250k, it's not unreasonable for your neighbors to expect basic upkeep and updates on your end."

battletech,fdcfkhq,t3_ekm423,1578273670.0,"I'd probably suggest checking out Ariesgamesandminis.com  .  They are generally cheaper,  and you can pick which figures you want.  For example,  If you want an Orion, but want a newer sculpt,  you could buy the Orion, ON1-H.  Unlike WH, it's totally ok to use an ON1-H to represent, for example,  an ON1-K.  That way you are not locked into just the lance packs and possibly getting  units you may not want."

Using the spider too jump into cover for 6 evasion and sensor locking is always useful, and being able too jump into a Rear or Side armor shot and opening up with 2xML, 2XSL as a finishing blow against weakened targets is a nice bonus."
