conspiracy,ffm4xzv,t1_fflus7p,1580048625.0,"I've heard way too many times that the internet ""connects"" us. It may transfer ""information"" quicker and to a broader audience, but no ...it doesn't necessarily connect us. It's the face to face interactions that connect us. It's seeing my friends, being actually/literally...in that moment that connects us. And, I'll state the obvious...the internet as means of communication...has actually contributed to misunderstandings and dissention.  Additionally,  someone has made gains by doing this. The way to break a system...or influence a large group of people...is to ""enter"" the system/ thought process and sway or break from within. Just like you are careful about the foods/ chemicals/ medications you put in your body, be mindful of what you let dwell in your psyche."
