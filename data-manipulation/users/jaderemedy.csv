gifs,fgnfg7w,t3_ezcveo,1580943730.0,"I know from experience what that is like. The embarrassment and fear of others knowing that I covered up how I was noticably injured by an abusive partner. 

My ex-wife slammed the corner of the door to our apartment into my face, splitting the brow above my right eye open. I told people that I was in a rush out the door and did it to myself on accident. I was ashamed that it happened to me, that I let her do it to me and I was scared of what people would say to me about it. 

Leading up to it, I was in the shower before having to go to class for a final exam. She got in the shower with me and tried to have sex with me, but I was stressed and distracted by the exam and couldn't get an erection. She interpreted that as I didn't think she was attractive and must be cheating on her and started fighting with me. I got out of the shower, dressed quickly, gathered my stuff and started heading out the door. She came charging out of the shower at me and grabbed the door as I was opening it, smashing it into my face. I was in denial of what happened and tried to tell myself it was an accident. She seemed genuinely shocked and remorseful. I look back now and see that she was just a master at gaslighting. I'm glad that I eventually found the courage to leave her, even though it cost me everything."

Keep documenting everything and talk to your lawyer. If you don't have one, search around for family lawyers and schedule a consultation. Most lawyers don't charge for a consultation."
politics,fg59izc,t1_fg57gyk,1580521695.0,"Their game is to fill the courts with conservative judges because those are lifetime appointments. They know that they will lose the Senate and the White House and they'll never regain control of the House of Representatives. Their plan after appointing all these judges is to then use the judiciary to dismantle every bit of progress this country has made over the last 70+ years. These scumbags are the absolute worst of the Boomer generation. They were children at a time when minorities had nothing and could do nothing. They were young men and women during the civil rights era and they hate the progress that was made then. They miss the world of their youth and want more than anything to bring that back. 

As long as these Republican Boomers continue to draw breath, they'll destroy everything they can. The world will be so much better off once they've all died off."

Veterans,ffc8g1g,t3_esqw60,1579793925.0,"The Unemployablility Classification is basically how they handle it when you can no longer work. If the VA deems you unemployable, you're paid at the 100% rate, even if your actual rating is not 100%. Many states don't require you to pay any property tax if you are 100% disabled or considered unemployable.  I live in Georgia and that's how it works here."

AmItheAsshole,felbjsr,t3_epkhy9,1579218326.0,"NTA. Dude, your GF sounds like my ex-wife.  She would behave exactly like how you describe you GF behaving. What she is doing is manipulative, controlling and abusive. This is a massive red flag, especially the ""We'll see if I come back."" line. Threatening the future of your relationship in order for you to cave to her demands is disgusting. I'd recommend you reflect on your relationship with her and think about other ways in which she has displayed this sort of unacceptable behavior over innocuous things cause I'm almost certain this isn't the first time she's treated you this way."

He was lamenting the cost of books and showed me one of the books he had to buy for his history class. He had bought it used. When he handed it to me, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This book had literally never been opened before. No spine wrinkles or cracks, no finger smudges on pages, totally pristine. The kid that had the book before my brother probably paid $100+ for it and sold it back for $10, and had never once needed it for the class he was required to buy it for."

I've been out for 12 years now and I still to this day feel completely detached from everyone I know and love.  While you are in a foreign land fighting and fearing for your life, everyone else back home is just carrying on like nothing is happening. It makes it so incredibly difficult to relate to anyone.
