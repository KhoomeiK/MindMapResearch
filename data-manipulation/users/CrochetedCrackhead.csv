DeepRockGalactic,fgsx7gl,t1_fgso8yc,1581094523.0,"I think my argument is that solo perks that help you not go down are never as effective as a team perk that help someone get you back up. I’d rather my teammate carry the iron will and field medic perks than personally carry the sweet tooth and thorns perks. The teammate perks seem to be pretty good in a firefight where you’re always on the brink of losing, while the solo perks seem to be best in a light wave of enemies or while exploring the cave."
DeepRockGalactic,fgswpba,t1_fgsuvfm,1581094226.0,"Sure, benefitting at all from your own perks will help the team, but beast master won’t really do as much as shield link for your teammates. 

*Myyyyy* gramps always said “Be prepared” (actually that was my dad but still) and being prepared means bringing the gear to help you out of the most likely and most dangerous situation. I’ve never had a life-or-death situation where I desperately needed a friendly bug (as much as steeve is helpful), but I end up needing iron will and field medic ALL THE TIIIIME when a mission goes sour. Just yesterday I had my most impressive team-revive yet, where everyone was down, I had iron will and I got everybody else back up before I collapsed.

Maybe my argument here is that some perks are still more useful than others (loot bug perk comes to mind) but what I’ve noticed is that the team-oriented perks most frequently top the must-have list.

On the other, color is an incredibly important part of game design and it allows the players to instantly know what they’re looking at. If you’re in the middle of a firefight and you think you’re about to go down right next to the downed gunner, you might activate iron will to get him up so he can put down a shield and rez you.

DeepRockGalactic,fgok6f6,t1_fgmzpmn,1580973088.0,"Absolutely. Iron Will was a band-aid placed over some pretty substantial balance issues with the game, such as an enemy with super-high ranged damage with no telegraphing and with no glowing parts (acid spitter) or the COUNTLESS stuns that make this game downright infuriating to play sometimes. 

A stun is totally tolerable (but maybe not pleasant) if there’s some warning and some chance to extricate yourself from the situation through clever playing. A great example is grabbers: they’re loud and they give you the chance to stop them before you’re snatched. A really goddamn awful example is jellyfish: they’re dead silent, they come in big groups, they have tiny little hitboxes so they’re pretty hard to hit with bullets, and sometimes they come from an infinite source that takes wayyy too long to take down if you’re stuck in the middle of a swarm."

We can all agree that iron will was a must-have perk. I’ll personally state that I feel like the game was pretty well balanced before the rework of iron will. If a game is pretty well balanced only as long as everyone uses the same perk, I feel like that perk should stop being a perk and should start being a core mechanic.
