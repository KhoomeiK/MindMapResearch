HVAC,ffdvatk,t3_et2odg,1579829814.0,Thank you I'll try that.
HVAC,ffdv7cn,t3_et2odg,1579829746.0,"The heat is not switching off. Both the blower and heat were running. It was around 27 c in the house when I got home from work. Turned thr stat right down, then switched it from auto to off and waited around 10 minutes, didn't shut off. So I switched the breaker off."
ATRIALFIBRILLATION,ffdjjri,t3_et19qa,1579822221.0,I've been on xarelto for almost 4 years. Dr kept me on it. I didn't have any heart rhythm issues for the longest time. I recently started getting palpitations again. I'm kind of glad I'm still on it. I've had no ill effects.
depression,ff9ajqr,t3_esdfuk,1579708581.0,Just try to work on one small goal. I'll do the same.
Anxiety,ff3dfzf,t3_erdbtw,1579538896.0,"I know 18 to 21 seems like a lifetime to you now, and you are only reflecting on what you have not accomplished. Take a bit of time to reflect on what you have accomplished. 

""I really want to make the most out of it since I didn’t at age 18, 19, 20. My peers are all out partying""

Trust me the time you took to focus on yourself, and your studies while staying away from partying had put you in a better place, more mature, and able to make less reckless choices.

""I feel so lame. I want to do things! But its hard when ur constantly thinkingg in the back of ur mind people dont like u""

I think you have answered this yourself... You constantly think in thr back of your mind that people don't like you... You're overthinking this. I respect you for taking it easy the first 3 years of your adulthood and allowing yourself to grow into your life. You are moving at a great pace. Celebrate this. It will all come together."

Divorce,feoot43,t3_eq6ztr,1579303248.0,"You're welcome
I read it, it reminded me of where I was 4 years ago when my life was also a dumpster fire. I wish I could pluck the pain right out of you. But I can't. You're gonna have to go through more shit. But I can tell you... No... I can promise you that it's going to get better... Way better. Keep venting when you have to."
depression,fen3g4k,t3_epydpj,1579276121.0,"Even taking a break helps, I shut down my social media like Facebook, and Instagram. The political back and forth is toxic. Great idea I wish you success and happiness."

ATRIALFIBRILLATION,feka1bg,t3_epm9di,1579195722.0,"Calling 9-11 while you're at the ER? Are you in Canada? I had problems at one hospital, they kept me over night. I told them I wanted to see a cardiologist. They prescribed meds and sent me on my way. I had a conversation with the Med tech taking blood from me, she shut the door and told me that I need to become my own advocate as far as my health was concerned and not give up until I recieve the care that I wanted. I drove to another ER. I was still not shown a cardiologist. I was told I had afib, and I would recieve a letter from cardiology when an apointment was made. 7 months later I had a cardioversion. Good for you for calling 911. These medical professionals at times play God. Hope you're feeling better."

ADHD,fek63qw,t3_epkomz,1579193390.0,"I have a big problem getting to sleep. My main problem is this addictive little hand held computer that keeps me up. I've planned to leave it in the kitchen and read before bed. I just keep screwing up. I've thought of a plan. I have a rule with my 10yr old son that electronics off at 8:30pm. In going to include me in that rule and have him enjoy the satisfaction of taking mine away too. Anyway try to stay off the device, could be messing with your bodies natural sleep rhythm."

ATRIALFIBRILLATION,fek39sy,t3_epl7vh,1579191690.0,I would seek out a different family Dr if the one you have now will not refer you to a specialist. If your heart begins to palpitate again. Head to the hospital.

NoFap,fejynaq,t3_epfsk6,1579188829.0,"I'm surprised there isn't a push for legislation on prohibiting the free online porn sites, this content obviously gets into the hands of young children, creates mental health issues. Tears families apart. I'm on day 4 of abstaining. It's definitely an addiction that should be taken seriously."
