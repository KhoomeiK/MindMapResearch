You should ask this question at a more generic Linux subreddit.

For me, in addition to ""the Amazon thing,"" the most concerning issues all come back to inserting themselves into the commercial end of things, in very Microsoftish ways.

Snapcraft is the current clusterfuck, owing to their attempt to control distribution, the auto-update fiasco (I don't care what these people say, it's a backdoor) and general performance misery (I don't give a fuck how hard they're working on it, it's been years and *it's a backdoor*.)

As to the rest, you're right (ofc) that a great deal of American-owned wealth is offshore. However, that's not why we're broke. The money missing from government coffers doesn't generally come from existing wealth, though more of it certainly could with a wealth tax, if one were so inclined.

Tax havens are a problem because the money never turns up in the first place, and was therefore never taxed as income or capital gains. That's a big problem, and should probably be a crime, but, if it were taxed, it would still be a drop in the bucket. Your work is critical because it exposes the mechanics of tax avoidance, but the deficit lies elsewhere.

Which is why I mind tweets like the OP. *For this subreddit's purposes*, it's a red herring, a symptom and not a cause of inequality.

As of 2016, so as not to utilize cartoonish post-McConnell/Ryan figures, America's tax-to-GDP ratio was lower than the UK's by, if I recall, about 3% of GDP, which *was* the deficit, almost to the penny. The UK's ratio was still lower than our other peers'.

Just buying a smartphone costs 100 hours' wages at federal minimum wage, or 50 hours' at Seattle's. Then, between a phone plan and web access, you're talking about *at least* $75/mo, and it could be twice that."

That doesn't mean the work isn't important. It means that pretty much anyone can do it, which means it's accessible to people with no particular training or expertise.

A storefront can't function without cashiers, but it doesn't take more than a few hours to learn the point of sale system. Now you're a cashier. Did you just learn a skill? No, you learned to use the software that makes the cash register open and print a receipt.

Portland,ffdvfep,t1_ffatd21,1579829903.0,"> Yes, this system that is still in production was designed in 1969. It's been upgraded, for sure, but it's not exactly ""patched"" anymore. Is your InfoSec spidey sense tingling? Don't worry, they built security into it back in 1985, so, it's good.

No, my senses aren't tingling, because, yes, it is good.

A system that old is inherently *easier* to secure *precisely because* it's ancient. Banks do the same thing. The US military often does the same thing. You don't upgrade because you think the mainframe is a security risk, you upgrade because you've finally exceeded its capacity to process the data you need to process.

Infosec is a neverending arms race because we keep introducing complexity. Introducing complexity is both good, on the whole, and necessary for advancement, but it also introduces new and novel attack surfaces.

Hardware from 1969, running security measures from 1985, using extremely limited capabilities, simply lacks the hundreds or thousands of attack vectors to which a typical server is ostensibly vulnerable. It's vulnerable to a *handful* of attacks, all of which have been well understood for decades.

The security concerns come into play when they approach modernity, not on account of they haven't yet."
