relationship_advice,ffekc5u,t1_ffeiza2,1579851623.0,I don’t like using dating apps/websites
relationship_advice,ffeeg6s,t1_ffeean8,1579844956.0,"Yeah true. I was quiet for a period of time before too, in the last 2 months. He even mentioned it. But I was going through stuff with my family. I’m also going back to university to study another profession this year. He said that I have to stay in his life forever and that I shouldn’t leave my current profession. I promised I would stay in touch with him. Lol. But he’s just kinda quiet lately. I wish I knew why."
relationship_advice,ffee1z7,t1_ffedxda,1579844567.0,I don’t think so. He’s been in a relationship with his gf for 16 years. I’ve known him for 10 years. He still reads my messages and looks through my Facebook stories and everything.
relationship_advice,ffedovu,t1_ffedjr9,1579844210.0,What does it mean when one of my guy friends whom I’ve known for years suddenly becomes somewhat distant? I’ve asked him if he’s okay and he sorta replies selectively to some of my messages. He is in a relationship so I’m not hitting on him and vice versa.
relationship_advice,ffedgay,t1_ffedaip,1579843980.0,"Yes I like a laid back guy. Someone kind, caring, empathetic. Smart. Someone who can go swimming or hiking with me, and someone who isn’t too serious about life. He has to have a good sense of humour. Is that good enough for a description?"
relationship_advice,ffed2iw,t1_ffecn0q,1579843619.0,Same. I feel the same way so I stopped going.
relationship_advice,ffecwkd,t1_ffecrsj,1579843461.0,"I actually can’t tell. Shitty guys I’ve met come in all sizes, shapes and forms. Nowadays if they start sending me a picture of their junk or ask me to send them pics of my private parts or they mention their ex, I just run away as fast as I can. 

I’m not sure what my type is. I like a guy who likes me for me. Likes my personality, not just wanting sex. Someone who is kind and caring, and smart."
relationship_advice,ffeckl5,t1_ffeceqw,1579843146.0,I’ve been to multiple churches and it’s been similar.
relationship_advice,ffeccud,t1_ffec7t9,1579842945.0,Thanks. That’s why I pursue goals nowadays rather than people and relationships with guys.
relationship_advice,ffecbb3,t1_ffec66d,1579842906.0,"I’ve met guys from church who are fellowship church leaders and work as a medical doctor. You would think based on that, they would be somewhat decent. But no, they just wanted sex, while they were already living with and having sex with other women already."
relationship_advice,ffec88o,t1_ffec11g,1579842828.0,I never go to bars or dating sites. And I do have friends that are guys but they’re in relationships already.
relationship_advice,ffec5ac,t1_ffec0kc,1579842751.0,Yeah I find most guys I met are players.
relationship_advice,ffec2ca,t1_ffebynh,1579842676.0,"Yes I used to go to music classes and tennis, and other classes. Haven’t met anyone I like yet."
relationship_advice,ffebxoi,t1_ffebuwh,1579842559.0,What do you suggest though? What kind of different areas? Or different approaches?
relationship_advice,ffebu1f,t1_ffebp2h,1579842466.0,I feel fine. I have male friends that I’ve known for years who never hit on me. We’re just platonic. Nope they don’t introduce any friends to me.
relationship_advice,ffebktn,t1_ffebgfh,1579842233.0,"No I usually initiate conversations with men too. I have friends that are guys. I go to church, and I go to volunteer groups. But some of the trashiest men are from church. They ask me for nudes or try to touch me inappropriately, even though I don’t know them."
relationship_advice,ffebb8x,t1_ffeb7uq,1579841992.0,I never accept their proposal though. I always refuse and ignore/block them.
relationship_advice,ffeb98w,t1_ffeb3vn,1579841944.0,"Well I don’t dress provocatively. I don’t even go to bars to drink and I don’t openly flirt with men. The men I meet are from church, from online forums like Reddit, or just when I’m out and about everyday."
relationship_advice,ffeax8m,t1_ffeatq1,1579841646.0,I don’t select them. They select me. I don’t even go to bars or other places where you would expect trashy men.

depression,feikkau,t1_feikhz2,1579140688.0,I haven’t actually done any coffee dates or catching up with anyone in over 2 years
depression,feikgh8,t1_feik9yl,1579140616.0,That sucks. Sorry to hear that. I did make a genuine effort to keep in touch with my old friends but they didn’t seem interested in hanging out with me anymore

depression,feafhy9,t1_fe7e95m,1578948076.0,Well I don’t know about you but it certainly does keep me from drinking alcohol and doing drugs. It says in the bible not to drink anyway.

depression,fe54kjp,t3_eno7v3,1578865583.0,I believe in God but still feel like crap. It does help having a relationship with God as I don’t turn to drugs or alcohol for comfort though.
GradSchool,fdp23h9,t1_fdozu2r,1578618167.0,"I’m seriously thinking of removing myself from the waitlist. It’s been very stressful (the whole process), and I felt that they shouldn’t have done reference checks unless they actually had a place available for me. Or they could’ve communicated that they’re just doing reference checks “just in case” (but they didn’t). It just temporarily got my hopes up and now my hopes have come crashing down again after they mentioned they did the reference checks “just in case”, AFTER the checks were done. The university could’ve also updated those on the waitlist that all places have been filled and that everyone who was offered a place has enrolled in the course (but they didn’t tell us this, until I asked yesterday)."
hellofresh,fcw9bt3,t1_fcw8xpq,1578020123.0,"Hi everyone, Please note: I posted a picture of what would be called Tex mex beef tostadas I made from a HelloFresh Recipe. On the recipe it gave the option to not bake the tortillas, and since I did not have an oven I followed that option and did not bake them. Someone here is saying that since I didn’t bake them, they would be called tacos instead. However if you were to bake the tortillas, it would be called Tex mex beef tostadas. Also please note that I didn’t add as much of the Tex mex powder to the beef mince either as I didn’t like the spicy taste."
hellofresh,fcw87h7,t1_fcuwk17,1578019377.0,I don’t have an oven to bake them.
FREE,fct7to2,t3_eipbbx,1577935162.0,"Yes please. I’m a Christian, but feel free to send me any quotes. Thank you. I’m struggling in family, work, and health."
gradadmissions,fct7e9h,t1_fct7b9f,1577934836.0,How many places were available? Also Were you number 7 in the waitlist ?
gradadmissions,fct798u,t1_fct701s,1577934727.0,"How is it possible though? It would mean 13 out of the 14 students who got offers have to reject their offers, and/or 12 people ahead of me in the waitlist have to request to have themselves removed from the waitlist plus one person who got an offer rejects it, and/or 6 people who got offers have to reject their offers plus 7 people ahead of me in the waitlist have to request to take themselves off the waitlist."
gradadmissions,fct4972,t1_fct3y0y,1577932482.0,"Wow that sounds amazing, PhD in biomedical engineering I mean. What did you apply for that got you waitlisted? The admissions team told me that they always have only 14 places each year. 

I know they’re saying I’m qualified as I’m on a waitlist but then why wasn’t I offered a place then? I feel so upset. It’s like they’re saying “you’re qualified but you’re our second best option, we believe we have better candidates ahead of you, if they don’t accept then we will offer you a place”. How do they decide who gets an offer and who goes on the waitlist??"
gradadmissions,fct1yc5,t1_fct1lrh,1577930771.0,"Thanks for explaining. What are you doing these days? I feel so disappointed. What’s even more disappointing is that I’m already a health professional, I applied for another health profession programme and got waitlisted. It feels like they’re saying that I’m not competent to be a health professional but instead of outright declining me, they put me on the bottom of the waitlist instead so as to not hurt my feelings. The program I applied for was in an allied health profession and I’m already an allied health professional, but just in a different field."
