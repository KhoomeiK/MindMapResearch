teenagers,ffemrmn,t1_ffe5ide,1579854859.0,"I'm sorry (I'm really not) that I use such language to describe your parents, but they're cunts. That's why I'm happy that I was able to finance my university studies through working on the side and getting good loans.

I hope you make it though, my dude."

""You got out of your home, left your childhood and all that sh\*t behind, and managed to become a mentally stable human being very close to have a doctor's degree in astrophysics? HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!""

And I would probably tell him to just fight through, stick to your friends, and get into therapy as soon as possible."
Kappa,fegf4e4,t1_fef64xk,1579090625.0,Here you go.
Fighters,fedjybd,t1_fedjixg,1579013420.0,"Yeah, I agree.
I should have clarified that I was talking about commentary duos in general, not specifically Tekken; I should have clarified that especially since the thread's about Tekken commentary."
Fighters,fed0dqy,t3_eodni8,1578992380.0,"Tekken has Steve and Rip, who would honestly argue against that? There's only one commentary duo that's more hype and that's TastyJam, but that beast is so powerful that it needs all the event organisers on the globe to shakle it with iron chains (i.e. almost everybody schedules the two of them such that they basically never get to commentate together, which is a damn shame...)

Edit: As was pointed out, Sajam isn't a big Tekken commentator, so I should have clarified that I was talking about TastyJam in a general context, whereas the purely Tekken side TastyRip got covered."
Kappa,fe8r61h,t1_fe7rsip,1578929654.0,"I know this r/Kappa, but, tbf, modders didn't do it yet, because it is an (almost) impossible task. SFV's netcode is just a bugged/flawed rollback netcode. Fix the bug, and you have good netcode.

Tekken's netcode is classic delay-based, so all the necessary structure you need for rollback netcode isn't there. The last time a game switched from delay-based to rollback it took multiple engineers close to a year for that task (which was MKX). This isn't gonna happen for T7 through mods, when you also need to reverse-engineer the code."
pcmasterrace,fe6v4or,t1_fe2y6oc,1578905913.0,This has been hanging on the wall next to my setup for what feels like 10 years now lol
gaming,fe6uf5d,t1_fe6st3p,1578905466.0,I should probably respect that.
MonsterHunter,fdpznwc,t3_em88cg,1578647608.0,"If I have the choice to play any kind of action game at 30 fps on a console, or 60+ on PC, I'm ALWAYS gonna wait for the PC version; easiest choice of my life :P"
Shadowrun,fdji2k4,t1_fdi2pxc,1578471776.0,"Well, shouldn't really surprise anyone, since LaTeX isn't designed for this sort of work, but rather excels at typing in a scientific context for which most of those decisions have been made."
aww,fdhbdeh,t1_fdhahj4,1578419340.0,"Depending on your viewpoint, I'm neither that lazy nor that efficient :p"
aww,fdgv2g0,t1_fdguk82,1578409047.0,But... it's an informal post... who cares? xD
MonsterHunterWorld,fdgtdgj,t1_fdgrl6d,1578407829.0,"Ha, didn't know it was that much less of a hassle for XBox... here's hoping Sony improves that feature for the PS5 then xD"
aww,fdgqh78,t1_fdggqg1,1578405643.0,"Exactly, that's not hope, that's extreme stress. And not exactly unjustified considering where that kitten is, and how old it is."

aww,fdgph8y,t1_fdgl8pu,1578404851.0,"No, little penguins are not necessarily living in large colonies like most other penguin species (little penguin being the name of the species, though they are also called blue penguins, little blue penguins, or, in Australia, fairy penguins (didn't know that one a minute ago, tbh)).

I quote: ""Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially"", and ""\[they\] spend the largest part of their day swimming and foraging at sea."" ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin))

I'm gonna take a wild guess that the rescue did their due diligance and released him or her in an area where others of that species are also foraging.

Edit: Forgot a word."
space,fdgc7fr,t1_fdfyetp,1578389655.0,"Exactly. I'm REALLY skeptical about this one... Even if the event happenend in the dead angle of the second detector (unlikely, but possible), then the event needs to remain unconfirmed; literally, since no confirmation has been made."
Guiltygear,fdgaw1y,t1_fctmaeq,1578387751.0,"So it is written... (I know, wrong game, still fits tho)"
dbfz,fdd9t03,t1_fdb68oo,1578301547.0,This. I'm kinda surprised he's still allowed on this subreddit.
shittymoviedetails,fdd99yv,t1_fdd3r42,1578300766.0,"Neither should Rian Johnson. He basically made a live action Star Wars anime.

But, to your point: JJA trying to then do his own thing on top of that instead of working with what he's got is equally terrible."
dragonballfighterz,fajxb23,t1_fajwmxt,1576156663.0,"Oh yeah, good point with the power up. So main game plan is gonna revolve around 18 and Broly bullying the opponent behind Black' assist, and then having Black as an anchor.

Thank you! :D"
