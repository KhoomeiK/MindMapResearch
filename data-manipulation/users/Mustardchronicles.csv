selfimprovement,fffpn4i,t3_esyh28,1579889068.0,"I think a part of it is wanting to finish a book or artwork for the sake of finishing it. It seems more like work, more like an accomplishment. You're not doing it for the thing in and of itself.

When I was a kid, there were a lot of books that I picked up and just skimmed. Or didn't even finish. I just didn't beat myself up about it. I followed my own interest flow. It's easier to remember the exciting books that I devoured.

So maybe that is the thing. To go in without expectations. Exploring genuine curiosity/excitement, instead of trying to be a particular sort of person. No ""I should""s, just playing."

selfimprovement,fffdg3g,t3_etadg4,1579881533.0,"Where to begin, oh man. Insecurity can eat up a lot of your life time and happiness...first and foremost, I would suggest you limit Instagram scrolling as much as possible.

Why? It's an avenue for comparing your worst/average to everyone else's best. It's all curated content. You don't see other people's insecurities.

(And I'm sure those pretty girls are doing the same thing to themselves. Think about how you separate good pictures of yourself from how you ""really"" look--they're probably rationalizing similarly. ""Pretty"" is this ethereal, beautiful concept that is hard to feel consistently as a whole human being. When you feed insecurity, you will pick out your flaws regardless of how you look...and you will miss the good/beauty that is there.) 

Think about all the celebrities you find attractive. They're all on top of their games. But they all have unique vibes...it's hard to choose an all-time, ""most attractive"" person when there are so many different sorts of attractive out there.

You are a unique person. There is nobody like you. So just be the best version of yourself, because you have a beautiful vibe that nobody else can compete with. 

What helps me feel like the best version of myself? 

1.) Exercise (I recommend yoga!). Moving the body around at all when you feel sad WILL help your mood.

2.) Showering/bathing (and picking hair/skin products that smell/feel really lovely to use). Also regular haircuts. 

3.) Wearing clothes that I really genuinely like, that make me feel that cute energy (trust your own sense of fashion).

4.) Drinking water regularly, and eating healthfully. You feel less sluggish, more alivey that way. Very confidence building.

5.) Watch videos that make you laugh. Genuine laughter kicks up your brain chemicals to a more positive, more confident place. You're forced to ease up a little."
depression,fehqqi1,t3_ep7v5x,1579121990.0,"That is perhaps how they feel when we isolate to ""test"" those connections.

Basic human compassion offers so much good energy. It asks for nothing and needs nothing. Tap into it and you don't need to prove anything.

I love so many people and regardless of the rest of our lives I will go on appreciating them. We're all on our own journeys."
depression,fehpt5r,t3_ep7s8c,1579121457.0,"Potential interpretation:

He was reacting to his feeling rejected. He immaturely wanted to put you down in that moment because he felt socially uncertain and bitter about it.

I'm a quiet person too. I've had similar moments of judgment/rejection. But it's a valid, totally understandable way to be in this weird world. Please don't give up."

UnsentLetters,fefpcub,t3_eop358,1579061466.0,"Just because they didn't love you doesn't mean they didn't want to.

I know. It sucks. But it is good/beautiful to be able to love so deeply."
depression,fedjw20,t1_fe5ebqm,1579013376.0,"That's fair. I have this problem too. 

In my case, here are components:

The human condition being inherently lonely (you can't completely 100% share your experience).

Isolating myself emotionally, not really interacting with those around me. So I feel alone, because I'm not genuinely involving myself in them or what's being talked about.

Not feeling able to be myself around certain family members, so the whole interaction feels empty on my end. Maybe they have aggressive personalities and/or different moral values. 

Looking for why I'm separate and alone, vs looking for similarities. In any social situation, I'm in the former group. And it's a dead end conversationally. 

Idk it helps me to write it out like this and notice my own patterns. Rethink and reframe.

Tl;dr--I relate to your response. When I think about my own struggle w/those feelings (the situations that aggravate them) I notice aspects I can control/modify."
depression,fdwm3kq,t3_cml6ni,1578760104.0,"On the plus side, I got ready right away in the morning. Dressed, teeth brushed, fresh clothes. Even before any caffeine (gasp)

On the minus side, I am still unemployed and need to figure that real bad. My stomach drops when I think about my resume. I lie in some way on every application I just feel so much shame about where I'm at."
depression,fdwl0gg,t1_fdvo6y1,1578759817.0,"We are social creatures. Your evolved human body longs to interact and communicate with other humans, because it's how we've flourished/survived on the whole. 

Loneliness is a serious, big problem. Just because there are ""worse"" problems doesn't mean loneliness is easy. Loneliness is so difficult and confusing.

Some days it feels like it's killing me, too. 

There should be a site/app truly for platonic friendships. A hub for lonely, socially awkward types to interact with others in the same boat."
depression,fdqiwd3,t1_fdqcstd,1578667778.0,Yes! Such a good feeling. That's a nice moment to read about right there.
depression,fdqie3b,t1_fdqeuph,1578667426.0,"Hey that sucks that your therapist was nodding off, I have never heard of that happening. That's uncalled for/completely unprofessional. 

It might be worth rebuilding with another therapist. If you feel like you're drowning--that's important to attend to. You want to trust that your therapist is (wakefully) there for you.

At the least, try talking about this with the current therapist. Maybe there was a reason they were extra tired that day. Either way it should be acknowledged.

Anyway. I feel you. The struggle is real af."
depression,fddu6ci,t1_fddhu40,1578324064.0,"You have a respite from the struggle. You're in a situation where you're removed from that negative cycle. 

I'm not saying the hospital is a vacation. Far from it. But when you are rock bottom, when depression has taken over totally, it can give you the space/distance to assess/plan/hope."
depression,fddtha1,t3_ekpvdz,1578323559.0,"I want to feel the way my pug does after a bath. Swaddled in blankets and hugged so tightly (she gets nervous about water). 

I want and/or need to feel that way, maybe always?"
yoga,fcyp5ui,t3_ejjbok,1578084264.0,"I'd recommend some mindful/extended trees and goddess/horse poses. Focus on spinning the knees outwards, constantly opening up while tucking the pelvic muscles up and in. Engage the muscles all around the pelvic region, integrate them into the pose. They're opening up with you (as cheesy and unintentionally sexual as that sounds). 

Knit your stomach muscles up and in, too. They are critical to moving weight off your lower back (which might be your problem). 

I dealt with pelvic tilt and have previously noticed issues at least similar to yours. This helped me! Idk"
