HomeworkHelp,fflpew2,t3_eu5wbk,1580042424.0,"This is the triangle inequality. You can prove this geometrically or a number of different ways.

however, assuming you are simply looking at the absolute value (and not a generic norm over vectors), the simplest approach is probably to just brute force prove it.  For instance, looking at just two variables, X and Y, then abs(x) is either x if x>=0 or -x if x<0.  Abs(y) is similarly either y or -y depending on y. For the four possible combinations, you can show abs(x + y) is either equal to abs(x)+abs(y) (when x and y are both positive, semi-definite) or it is going to be less than abs(x)+abs(y) (when either variable or both variables are negative)."

Pandora will go under soon because they lose money each year (the record companies have a strangle hold on this industry, they set the prices and the amount artists make, and they set the price to make sure companies like Pandora won’t be profitable).  When Sony finally strangles out Pandora, you’ll happily be back to paying the full price Sony wants to charge you, so you will only be able to listen to the songs you have paid $20/album for or $3/single, and you’ll be back to having no ability to listen to any other songs you didn’t buy... so start saving money from your paycheck... but I’m sure you’ll love to pay that $15/month to Sony streaming subscription service.

And when Pandora goes away and you are happily locked back into Sony’s ecosystem, Pharrell will still only get $3K/quarter for the song, because this is the price Sony has dictated.

Pandora has no control to set the price per play or the amount an artist gets from playing a song.  Sony sets the price it charges per play and sets the amount it pays to artists.  Pandora never had any control over any of this."
todayilearned,ffk1sdu,t1_ffk11g3,1580013182.0,"Actually, Pandora would be paying Sony $600K per year to stream Happy.

Sony only pays the artists $10K/year from this?

todayilearned,ffjyknh,t1_ffjs6uv,1580010509.0,Yeah I read that too and I am wondering WTF people in this thread are talking about.  Pandora is paying a lot of money for streaming Happy to Sony.  Sony is keeping all the money and giving almost none of the profits to Pharrell.

Damn I should have been a music company executive.

I’m wondering because I don’t think anyone actually read the article, you are just assuming Pandora isn’t paying artists from the title of this post.  The article says the opposite, Pandora is paying a lot to Sony, but Sony that isn’t paying its artists."
todayilearned,ffjxb3c,t1_ffjg2ix,1580009507.0,"So Pandora pays $150K to the music label company (music publisher Sony/ATV) for the first 3 months of this song, and the company turns around and gives the artist (Pharrell) less than $3K of this?
