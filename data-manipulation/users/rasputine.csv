The actual legal entity of the Green Party formed in 1983 in Ontario, but it didn't spring from the aether fully formed in that year. Members of the Wilderness Committee quickly became involved in the new environmentalism political party that rose out of the Small Party...three years after the party started as the anti-nuclear-energy Small Party.

Maybe you're thinking of the *revival* of the national Green party? The federal party collapsed under in-fighting in the mid-80s, and was effectively re-founded in the late-80s by the BC Greens, who were *very* closely related to the Wilderness Committee, and *also* founded in 1983, a few months before the Small Party founded the Green Party of Canada?"

Thou, thee and thine/thy were generally used as either informal pronouns (so you'd call your friend ""thou"" but your coworker ""ye"") or used when speaking to someone socially beneath you (so you'd call your boss ""ye"" and your boss would call you ""thou"")

Still common in at least French and Spanish. In France you'd use ""vous"" for formal and ""tu"" for familiar, pretty well exactly the same way.

English usage of the familiar ""thou"" dropped off sharply in the 17th century, and was basically gone by the 18th century. I've read a lot of various reasons, but the one I'm most convinced by is that the King James Bible had god saying ""thee"" and ""thou"", and it became primarily associated with instructions from god, rather than familiar fondness.

Wait time for HRT was the amount of time it took between me deciding to start HRT, and me seeing my doctor. She had me take a blood test, ECG, urinalysis, (because I'm old, therefore more at risk of brain explosion) then discussed what schedule I was comfortable with on starting HRT. Total time before the process ""began"": one week before she had an appointment available. Total time between deciding to start HRT and getting my first prescription: One week, 5 days. Total cost to that point: $0.

Canada doesn't cover drugs for everyone, and I make too much money to be covered. It costs me ~$60 CAD/month($45 USD), for my prescription. My work-provided drug coverage knocks 80% off that cost.

There's basically *zero* overhead for beginning HRT in a functional trans healthcare system. It required nothing more than a quick chat about what I wanted and what I expected, and a checkup to ensure my  brain wouldn't pop.

I have no personal insight on surgical wait times. They used to be two-years-plus long for bottom surgeries, but they have recently opened two more surgeries. Top surgeries for trans men do a bit of a rollercoaster as people with breast cancer tend to jump to the front of the queue. Breast augmentation has a very short wait period, but is only covered in some cases.

canadaleft,fgnnxme,t1_fgnfr1o,1580949019.0,"> Is it mainly just that libs still believe in capitalism?

That's a pretty big start. The entire left side of the generic political spectrum is ""fuck capitalism tbh"", and the right side is ""capitalism is good, actually"". 

Definitively liberal marquees (in theory, not always practice) are representative democracy, free market, nationalism, free trade, limited government, negative rights (this is the kind of right established in our charter of rights and freedoms, or the American bill of rights, ""the government won't oppress you in this way""), and primacy of private property (not to be confused with personal property). Things that are also directly tied into it, because liberalism either allows for, encourages, or simply demands, are imperialism, incredible wealth disparity, a rigid class system, extreme poverty, colonialism, racism, tripping dick-first into fascism in a frothing terror that poor people might get rights, losing the space race and slavery.

Definitively socialist marquees (again, by theory) are workplace democracy, positive rights (the right to clean water, the right to healthcare), some variant of social ownership of private (again, not personal) property, some combination of tightly controlled market and non-market allocation of resources, the annihilation of the class system, racial gender and other assorted equalities. Things that are also directly tied into it, because socialism either allows for, encourages, or simply demands, are near zero wealth disparity, zero poverty, anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, anti-racism, literally defeating the actual Nazis, winning the space race, anti-slavery, getting blamed when the country with the largest military on earth overthrows your government for not letting them steal your resources and murder your children, largest number of doctors-per-citizen, world-class transgender health care, legalizing homosexuality in 1917, having to fight liberals who have sided with the Nazis against allowing jews, homosexuals, romani, the disabled, jehovas witnesses, slavs and poor people to not be burried in a mass grave in poland, and a smaller forced labour prison system than the USA, but with a scary name so it's worse now.

You may note that the ""socialism"" marquees listed above are a bit vaguer than the liberal ones, and there is a reason for that. Liberalism is a fairly closely defined thing, it is *an* ideology, with some space to walk around in terms of how those things are defined/implemented or who counts as a ""person"" who gets rights, but it's pretty well just one thing with wiggle room. Socialism, on the other hand, is an enormous spectrum of disparate ideologies. Communism, Marxism, Syndicalism, Democratic Socialism, Guild Socialism, State Socialism...are all very different creatures. This is a bit of why ""leftist infighting"" is a bit of a meme. On the other hand, the last Canadian election was five right-wing parties, and one centre party that sometimes drifts a little left."

Mmmk. The country that unambiguously kicked the absolute shit out of the United States is a unified communist state, broadly successful despite 35 years of anti-imperial wars, twenty further years of trade embargo, and huge swathes of the country poisoned by illegal chemical weapons, illegal cluster-munitions and illegal land mines. Hundreds of Americans deserve to be tried and hanged by the Hague for their crimes, but the USA has repeatedly threatened to arrest the ICC if any charges are brought against their war criminals.

The country that fought the USA to a standstill is still divided in two. One a fascist dictatorship for decades, where it remains a criminal act, punishable by up to seven years in prison, to criticize the president or certain major corporations. The other, crippled by US war crimes, the loss of the vast majority of Korea's arable land, is a hermit state, banned by US-led embargoes from trading with the vast majority of the planet. Mysteriously, the economy seems to be somewhat hampered by those embargoes. Literally the best thing I can say for America regarding the Korean war is that they did not allow one of their generals to carpet-nuke the entire Korean peninsula, like he wanted to.
