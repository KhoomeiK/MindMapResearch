I don't know where you are at, but I can't imagine being sentimental about a house that is worth (at most?) $50,000.  A house in general I consider a liability, a house you don't live in??-- Absolutely a liability, I don't care what the balance sheet says.  She will probably figure that last part out in time."

todayilearned,fcieosq,t1_fchyuzp,1577661418.0,"There is probably a little gamesmanship to all of it.  I mean the reddit mouth breathing crowd thinks just say 1 billion dollars Austin Powers style.  Until you figure out that a company like Apple with about 4000 lawyers that will just ascend on the local city council and promise jobs and tax revenue so now you start the eminent domain game and now you wind up with about 1/4 of what you could have had if you hadn't tried to be the smartest guy in the room and just named a salty, yet price the company wouldn't otherwise bother with fighting...."
science,faue4xt,t1_fatrvvc,1576347195.0,"I think there is more nuance than the ""obvious"" comments above.  NPR had done an interesting piece on charities a few years back, and one of the frustrating things from the charities perspective is say you donate to the Redcross (any charity organization that has multiple projects they are working on) for help with 9/11 (any big well publicized tragedy) and even though 9/11 has ample funds bc of how well publicized it is, federal relief, etc, if they do anything other get your dollars to 9/11 that you donated under the guise of 9/11 to those victims and word gets back the charity basically loses it's credibility going forward.  So say you had a tornado hit a trailer park in kansas and these people don't even have drinking water, let alone college funding for their great great grandkids, the Red Cross wouldn't dare send those desperately needed dollars you donated to the trailer park as opposed to the college fund for great great grandkids effected by 9/11.  Human behavior is funny and frustrating.  Anyhow my guess is that is what the article is alluding to...  Maybe not I generally don't know shit."
