teslamotors,ffelrzc,t1_ffdhb8o,1579853495.0,"That's simply not true. I have a Tesla. The slowest one. When the cruise control accelerates all on its own from standing still at a light, it is not ""very slow"".

All these safeguards are software. Where there is software there can bugs, even if they require an extremely unlikely combination of circumstances to trigger. Even extremely unlikely things do happen. I'm a software engineer, I know what I'm talking about.

Note that I'm not saying Teslas have an unintended acceleration problem. They probably don't. Just that this guy's story is not watertight."
AskReddit,ffbe0kr,t1_ffaulc3,1579761297.0,ZZ Top were right all along!
teslamotors,ff9s2kq,t1_ff89c4t,1579719960.0,"> The drive units contain at least three distinct pieces of hardware that all simultaneously crosscheck any pedal input. The pedal hardware itself contains two independent sensors that must agree as well. This way, only a genuine pedal input will cause torque to be commanded. There are additional crosschecks of this in other modules as well, such as the ABS.

This is obviously not the entire story, otherwise cruise control, Autopilot or self-driving would be impossible, all of which happen without any pedal input. There is software which can command the drive unit on its own, and where there is software there can be bugs."
