cpp_questions,ff706b0,t1_ff5y12n,1579638482.0,"Have you looked into OpenCL? It can do matices easily on GPU. Disadvantage is that you need to maintain separate source file, there is extra biolerplate code that goes into invoking kernels (opencl functions) and debugging is difficult as computation is happening on GPU. 

Then there is TBB (intel's thread building blocks) which makes multithreadong quite easy. There are other intel libraries like MKL (math kernel library) which does math stuff. Though I haven't used it personally. But I have used opencl and tbb and they are good. 

Then there is CUDA but it works only on nvidia gpus and you need specific compiler for it. Advantage is you can have your c code in the same file as cuda code so you don't have to maintain separate source file."

cprogramming,ff3rfey,t3_erhk03,1579547237.0,"What is value of n when you define arrays a[n] and b[n]? You haven't initialized it. 

If you want to use VLAs, you need to define them after you get value of n from user. So first do your scanf and then do int a[n], b[n].

Are you expecting user to enter single digit followed by enter? What if user enters

123

456

789

Are you gonna reverse it as 789 456 123? 

If your purpose is just to display numbers, you don't need to reverse-copy a[] to b[]. You can just print the numbers right there in reverse order."
