Cityofheroes,ff9y1g6,t3_erwezw,1579723967.0,"Controllers are great at making things go smoothly but have some important distinctions in powersets: needing to hit foes, needing foes to be in range of effect, controls only affecting foes in range at that time, and if the controller gets mezzed.

While all controllers are fine if things are going well, sets that rely on hitting like dark tend to not save you when things go badly.

Ice/time has a great continuous control with 2 toggles, but the foes have to be right around you.  On the ITF you will get hit from foes at a distance, so this is unreliable.  In general this means you are going to want powers that buff your allies rather than debuff your foes so they always work.

Controls only affecting foes in range at the time means hitting an AoE hold vs. dropping an earthquake.  If more foes move into the area the AoE is like goggles but the earthquake affects the adds.

And the controller getting mezzed and toggles dropping is a problem unless you have substantial mezz protection - so this varies.

On the control side I would go with earth or electric.  Earthquake and static field are available a lot and are reliable control even when foes move into an area.    

On the buff/debuff side I would go with thermal.  The shields protect your allies from any foes.  You have heals if you need them when things to badly.  Heat Exhaustion and Melt Armor are great for taking down AV's and EB's you encounter in the ITF.

So earth/thermal or electric/thermal controller.  These are not the best for making a TF that is going well go faster, but for making a TF that is going badly do fine."
explainlikeimfive,ff9kanf,t1_ff9ezca,1579714803.0,"They take longer in two ways.

Cells in different parts of the body reproduce at different rates - basically the expected rate that they are needed to be replaced.  Your stomach replaces cells quickly, but bones are not expected to break so they do not produce a lot of new bone quickly (your bone structure is not actually cells).

As a note - in your bone marrow is where your body produces blood cells - those do reproduce very quickly.  So part of what is in your bone reproduces very quickly, part reproduces slowly.

But the bigger part of bones healing slower is strength.  A fractured bone will have connections made fairly quickly, but it will not be strong enough to support weight for weeks.  That's because bones need to be stronger than other body parts and because we are talking about complete breaks.

If your achilles tendon is torn and repaired with surgery it takes weeks for it to repair itself so it can support you.  At 6 weeks you can only stand on it for 10 seconds at a time.  At 4 months you will be basically back to normal, but not fully.

A broken femur bone in your leg takes 3 to 6 weeks to heal.  So that actually recovers faster than your achilles tendon."
