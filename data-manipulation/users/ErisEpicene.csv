mildlyinteresting,fgtg2mv,t1_fgt6da3,1581104035.0,"Honestly, I think Walmart is on the verge of a tipping point. There's no respect or communication up or down the ladder. Most of the management is abusive. Those who don't quit stop caring and trying as a defense mechanism against it. Those who work and try harder receive more abuse and higher expectations, but not increased compensation or opportunities. They fire good employees for shitty reasons (they just fired my MIL, an assistant manager, for not working deli because she had the flu and was the only one working front desk customer service) or technical errors in their systems. People who have been around longer are either part of the problem or say the company gets worse all the time. Corporate constantly sends erratic, changing, sometimes fully contradictory instructions. Several times in less than two years I spent a full day or two on a major project, only to go back and undo it/redo it ina different way within a week. I was regularly given bad information or just plain lied about policies, resulting in things like benefit delays. The only metric they keep is attendance and the only behavior that matters is authoritarian obedience to the manager talking down to you in this moment.

If you want total control over the course of a somewhat less flavorful story, custom main is the way to go. If you want more interesting twists and are okay with choices occasionally being made due to your character's backstory, origin main is the way to go. If you want an origin main story, but also to have a custom character to rp and feel like ""you"" you can start a local game with two players, create one of each, then drop out the second player.

It could be a very frustrating experience. The predictability was a trade off to create more control for the player."
DivinityOriginalSin,fg1bg6v,t3_evvx72,1580424179.0,"I decided on a structure to see all of the stories that makes sense for the characters. My first run is full party Ifan, Sebille, Lohse, and Beast because only Sebille is a real loner, but she gets along well with Ifan. I also have builds for all of them that suit their personalities (Ifan ranger, Sebille necro-knight, Beast poly dual wield, Lohse healing summoner) that also make a well rounded physical team. I generally let their personalities dictate the story choices. I choose the one that says [NAME] every chance I get. Then I have plans for Fane and Red Prince to each have their own lone wolf save files. Fane will have a custom undead geo summoner and he will be a necrogue. They fill the world with poison that heals them and hurts others. Being ancient undead, their concept of living morality and indeed life itself are loose and malleable. These are the Sourcerors they warned me about in Source Hunter class all those years ago. RP will have a custom lizard partner who is explicitly his slave. I don't know what builds they will have, but it's going to involve fire. That'll get me the story of all the characters in ways that make good canon sense, which is how I usually like these games. But I do realize most people don't enjoy planning ahead as thoroughly as I do, preferring a more organic experience."
DivinityOriginalSin,fg12qb9,t3_ew6w2y,1580419661.0,"So, in DOS1, the AI is really, really bad at handling fire. It straight up shuts off enemies way more often than you'd expect. If you put them in a large enough lake of fire (not difficult between fireball and all the oil spreading options) enemies will skip their turns over and over again. Even ranged characters that could lob some arrows your way without moving will refuse to act. I won so many battles with ease because one or two characters would just stare at my lake of fire and cry the whole battle. The other elements have more potential for direct CC with freeze and stun and ice knockdown, but no CC is as strong as an enemy just giving in to the fire gods."

DivinityOriginalSin,ffz9qqo,t3_ew118t,1580368693.0,"> I keep hearing about ""not having a mixed party"" but the heck does that even mean? 

The game has a two faceted armor system. Characters have physical and magical armor, and every attack targets one of these armors or the other. Status effects, which are crucial to controlling the field and flow of battle, are blocked by one armor or the other. So the common strategy is to focus on eliminating one armor pool across the whole enemy team. A mixed team will eliminate armor pools more slowly than a team that focuses on one, and therefore apply status effects more slowly. That said, you can still use a wide variety of interesting skills no matter what your party composition. Necro and poly do physical damage. Summoners can use different elements to choose to be physical or magical. Archers can enchant their arrows with elements. Pyros can hit things with staves that throw burning sparks. Hydro has enough healing, buffs, and utility to have a place on any living team. And you can make it by with a mixed damage team. You'll just have a generally easier time if you're all working together on the same armor type and set of status effects."

GF&O is one of my favorite bands. I appreciate that people talk about them at all, but I wish it wasn't always the same song. Save the Rich is so relevant right now."

I think it could have been two books that better fleshed out each half of the story: the first starting with the superflu and going until the survivors meet and form two major camps, throw in a little foreshadowing; then a second book that focused on the showdown and Dark Tower connections. I think both of those books could be better than the halves they would replace. But few things are their perfect form."
worldnews,ffcrjor,t1_ffcirfn,1579805786.0,"Honestly, it's better to think of The Stand as a Dark Tower universe novel than a horror novel. It fits really well into King's full scale fantasy universe. It's about lonely, desperate people coming together for a somewhat abstract battle of good vs evil. It's a common structure for Dark Tower stories."
