cats,ffejme1,t1_ffe7xqj,1579850725.0,"I was right there with you, misunderstood what was going on due to the weird perspective. I thought the cat was on the ground and op was referring to the cat as ""it."" 

Turns out the camera is on the ground looking up at the cat, and the ""it"" is in reference to the camera. 

I have to admit I was sharpening my Pitchfork, as I think it's kinda fucked up when people refer to their pets and/or babies as ""it.""

I once worked with a guy who was telling me about how his gf left him after giving birth to their daughter and left the baby with him. He kept saying things like ""it's mother left me and now I have to take care of it by myself."" All I could think of was that poor baby being raised by someone that thinks of and refers to her as an object, without a name or identity, and how it was an inconvenience to him.

Luckily, his mother ended up getting custody of ""it"" and gave her the respect and love she deserved.

But I digress, I'm glad I misunderstood in this instance."
