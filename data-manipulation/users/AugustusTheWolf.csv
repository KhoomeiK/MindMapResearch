As he pointed out, wolves are opportunistic predators and will take advantage of our massive deer overpopulation here in Colorado before they damage elk herds. They will also curb CWD, as we've seen in other regions, wolves target weaker members of a herd. Curbing our massive mule deer populations will also reduce the number of deer related traffic accidents, and less to denser flora in Colorado without deer rampaging through it all.
