TwoXChromosomes,ff5bql0,t1_ff5026b,1579586462.0,"Someone mentioned a lot of it probably goes toward insurance. 
I worked at a daycare last year, got all the training and was so excited because I could take my baby. 

I got paid $11/hour but had to pay for my kid to be there and they didn’t take taxes out (contract worker, working full time?) so I had to pay a ton back when it came to taxes. Also was sick, had pink eye most of the year. Totally wasn’t worth it."

Some people here are happy with it because they don’t want to pay for other people’s medical costs and if you can’t afford to go to the doctor you shouldn’t have a cell phone or TV or car or whatever. Bootstraps."
AskReddit,fevxdqx,t1_fetd3d8,1579402697.0,"I have a cool story of this happening to me! 
So I had a specific dream that I was with my friend and this random thing happened, well I knew I’d forget about it so I told that friend all about it the next day. YEARS LATER we’re walking down the hall at school and it all happened. Just like I said it would. I looked at her in complete shock and excitement and when she looked at me I knew that she’d remembered too! It was unbelievable!! We still talk about it!"
