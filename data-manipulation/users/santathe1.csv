ChoosingBeggars,fggg6du,t1_fggd39t,1580761191.0,"Your idea is a good way to destroy those jobs. 

I’m saying, increase the price of the food to include the salary. This way, not every customer has to freely hand out 30% of the bill. It would be covered by the totality of the customers. Common sense: Employer wins, employee wins, customer wins. With tipping: employer wins, employee neutral/wins, customer loses always. 

I can pay for the food. I will not pay someone else’s employees. I’ll let the employer do that. No ones giving me free money at my job."

ChoosingBeggars,fgg8zd7,t1_fgg8loh,1580756822.0,"I agree. 

Increase the price of the food to be able to pay your employees a living wage.

As for your Brazil example:
Some countries call it a “service charge” and it is optional (in some countries). If they add it to the bill, you can ask them to get you new bill without  it. Don’t go to that place again tho, to reduce your chances of eating adulterated food."
