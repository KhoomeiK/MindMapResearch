Barbie’s one of a kind, loves to be near you a lot but if you pat her the wrong way she’ll let you know about it with a nip. Also hates being picked up. 

She’s our eldest girl out of our other cat and dog, and we adopted her from an animal shelter where she actually let me hold her. When she licked my face and I saw her sweet kitty soul, I knew she was the one. 

She’s helped me through a lot too, we adopted her not long after we had a little kitten named Ziggy of a few months that sadly passed away of heart failure (rescued from a pet store and he was my everything too.) I didn’t want to replace Ziggy but knew that he would want me to give another kitty like Barbie a loving home. 

Love you Barbs x"
