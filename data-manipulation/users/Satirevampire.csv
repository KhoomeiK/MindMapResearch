calmhands,ff5lq7l,t1_ff5lbkg,1579599073.0,"Ah yes, similarly afflicted with thin and bendy. I had a few gel manicures, and my nails did grow, but were basically like paper when they were removed, so not helpful!

Which treatment are you using? I'm UK so may not be available here, but I'd be interested to hear in case it is.

Ha! I hear you on the sharp tool resistance! If only it wasn't so satisfying! ;) this is the year I have beautiful nails though, so I must be strong! I did have a wee chuckle at your descriptions of your use of cuticle oil - sounds familiar too - one obsession for another!! :)"
calmhands,ff5k5j5,t1_ff3zhax,1579596732.0,Well done!! I'm late 30s and just trying to get this shit in order! My nails are really splitty (I take vitamins/have a good diet) so I wondered if the picking/biting has messed with my nail beds and that would heal when I stopped. Did you have splitty nails prior to stopping too by any chance? Thanks! :)

piercing,fdi72u6,t1_fdi2ikb,1578436893.0,"Absolutely! It healed quite nicely as well - I don't tend to do much with my piercings, and do the LITFA method unless there's an issue, which so far, has worked well! If you have long hair, it might tangle a bit, mine did, but nothing serious. I actually cut my hair shorter not long after getting it done - definitely not to show it off, nope definitely not!! ;) I see above someone else commented about your tragus. Will you get it redone do you think? I think it looks amazing, shame it's a bit shallow just now, but it happens! I'm now toying with the idea of a vertical tragus in my other ear!! Lol! Also, I love the link to the jupiter earring another poster made, it's such a pretty style! :)"
piercing,fdi1wil,t1_fdh9wkp,1578434264.0,"I have a daith, and it was no worse than my tragus if that helps! Worst bit was getting the jewellery in as my piercer fluffed it a bit - she's usually flawless! Love the teeny hoops! :)"

chernobyl,fdbu08q,t3_ekd1px,1578262083.0,"Chernobyl Prayer by Svetlana Alexievich is brilliant - all the chapters are monologues from people who were there. Chapter 1 is Lyudmila Ignatenko's story. I read the whole book in one sitting.

Eta: no science in it really though - more the human experience. I'm at the start of Midnight in Chernobyl, and so far it's great.

Eta2: Chernobyl:History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy is also interesting, but I haven't finished it yet."

AskWomen,fd1p1yj,t3_ejqvkp,1578134578.0,"£0 both times. Apart from my NI contributions over the years. With my first I had a 5 day stay with baby under UV lights, in a single room, after giving birth in the midwife unit. With my 2nd, I was taken for an emergency C section, had an epidural, and was in for 4 days, in a 6 bed ward. Care was excellent both times.
Prescriptions for anti depressants were also free (Scotland) afterwards! 
ETA: probably £10 in parking - and £30 for a parking ticket, which was later refunded."

If you've got a spare few dollars/quid, then go get yourself a copy of 'the gift of fear' or get it out of the library. Read it cover to cover, and digest it all.

Plus I can tell when my kids are lying (just because I know them so well) and it drives them nuts when we play games/cards/anything involving bluffing, as I can see right through them!"
AskWomen,fcql1fy,t1_fcpu7is,1577887881.0,"Yup! My friends are a bit freaked out, as I just seem to know things, but it's not hard - I pay attention and listen to what's not being said/body language/tone. It can be a curse, when I don't have the time/inclination to deal with someone who's a bit 'off' but equally I can weed out liars with ease. 
Also, always always always listening to my gut instinct - it's never steered me wrong, and I've regretted it when I haven't. It's not some supernatural thing, it's just my brain processing things I haven't (consciously) noticed yet."

Of course, people in the waiting area don't see everything that's happening behind the scenes, or that the staff have just come out of a child resus attempt, or trauma situation, so need 5 minutes to get their shit together, before they deal with the next person, who has a 6 day history of moderate tooth ache, but is screaming that they've waited 4 hours and they're going to report you!
