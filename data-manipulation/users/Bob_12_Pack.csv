ITCareerQuestions,ff9sdfj,t3_esc5by,1579720179.0,"I've been working in state funded higher-ed for the last 20 years after working in the corporate world for 6 years, we currently have about 17,000 students.

I started as a developer but after a few years, trained to be an Oracle DBA in order to support a new ERP system that was coming to replace our aging mainframe.  One of the great things about higher-ed for me is that I don't just do DBA work, I'm also responsible for the installation and maintenance of the ERP system which includes many tomcat servers, various other linux and Windows VMs that run products that integrate with the ERP system.  The ""jack of all trades"" thing is partially true, but I've mastered the technologies I'm responsible for.  I don't do hardware or infrastructure, we have other people for that.  I've turned down offers from corporations because they wanted me to do Oracle 100% of the time, I like having a broad skill set.  Currently we are migrating everything into the cloud (because we are prone to hurricanes), that's been really exciting and also still adding new skills at age 47.

One of the startups I worked at in the late 90's functioned more like we do because of the small staff, but some of our larger ""sister"" schools in the system function more like large corporations, with dedicated people for each and every thing.

Personally I like not having to be concerned with layoffs, stock price, etc, and I will have an awesome pension coming before long."

tifu,fehutrm,t3_ep5mcc,1579124306.0,"I had to take a makeup a exam once for a very difficult Comp Sci course because I had to leave school a few days for a funeral.  Everybody knows you don't get the same exam as the rest of the class when to take a makeup.  The prof posts test answers online, so I studied the exam that the rest of the class took, even printed a copy because it was an open-book exam.    Lo and behold the makeup test was the exact same exam.  I really struggled with what to do, it was my senior year, I could really use an A in this class.  Ultimately I decided to fess-up and inform the prof that I had seen the exam, at least I would still have my integrity.  He was so impressed with my honesty, coupled with the fact that he fucked-up, he just gave me an A rather than put together a new exam.  

End of story, right?  No, it turns out another student had also ran into this same situation, but instead of fessing-up, he took the exam and scored the highest grade in the class. The prof confronted him in front of the whole class, gave him a chance to fess-up, and then booted him saying ""C students do not get 100% on this exam"".  It turns out there was 1 question nobody got correct, and even the posted answer was wrong, and this kid used the posted answer.  Oof I dodged a bullet."

ITCareerQuestions,fegx9g0,t3_ep25oy,1579104581.0,"I've worked closely with sysadmins for years, and currently I work as part sysadmin and the full-time sysadmins work under me.  We typically deal with developers, analysts, etc that work regular business hours, but we work regular hours plus quarterly maintenance weekends, monthly patch nights, and basically are on call 24/7.  We have developers/analysts that will enter a ticket/work request, then email us about said ticket, then call or even show-up in our doorway.  We can certainly come across as grumpy when interrupted, and some sysadmins aren't quite as social as others.  A few things that really peeve us is asking for help with a problem that we've showed you the solution for before, or asking us to do something you can do yourself, not researching the issue (i.e. Google) or not providing us with key info (such as error messages/numbers) that helps us diagnose the issue, telling us ""such-and-such is broken"" without any additional info.  The best devs/analysts are the ones that say ""this is the error we are getting, I believe this is the solution.""  I work with some awesome sysadmins and we have a reputation for being top-notch, but that can lead to others getting lazy and just passing problems on to us without doing any legwork themselves.  We are happy to help, just don't pass the buck, and don't create extra work for us because you couldn't be bothered to backup your files or put them in version control."

I’m not saying you should not bond with your baby, but there is an instinctive visceral bond that develops between the mom and the baby, and I really believe that needs the time to occur.

AskReddit,fds0s7q,t1_fdqpbx3,1578692469.0,"This is one I don't have a problem with.  Mom's need to physically and mentally recover from giving birth.  They also need time to bond with the baby, and establish new routines for the household.  Dad's should be there at first to support the mom while she is recovering, but let's face it, we aren't really needed as much once mom gets her groove back.  

So these workplace norms are established for the traditional family, but of course not all of them fit the mold.  I don't know how same sex parents would fall under these rules.

It was important to charge by the day, because sometimes the parent will pick the kid up early and you have lost the day, also helped with planning income.  Every kid she ever kept either belonged to a friend, or was referred by a friend.

She had retired, but a friend practically begged her to take on her kid for 2 days a week, and now it's down to half days because he is in preschool, still gets $45 per day for him.  The great thing about this is that all of the kids she has kept (and their parents) are still in our lives and my 13 year-old son is still best friends with one of them that started coming here at 6 weeks old.  She treated each kid as one of her own, taking them to the beach or whatever she was doing with our kids at the time.

You are exactly right, comparing salaries can lead to low moral and cause drama in the workplace.  When you hire someone, you make an offer, there may be counter offers, etc, so some folks may accept less or demand more, and it creates a natural disparity.  

I work for a state university, all of our salaries are posted online, and it does cause drama.  I'm an Oracle DBA and have been well compensated for many years at this place.
