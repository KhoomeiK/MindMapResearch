fatlogic,ffdbd21,t1_ffbzob3,1579817224.0,"The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists states that a BMI of 15.5-22.9 is normal for Asians. This has been disputed, esp by the WHO, but it's worth noting that the AACE focuses more on individuals and the WHO on populations. I don't want to drop to a BMI of 15.5, in fact I like being in the 17s and am healthy - I get my period regularly, my bones are good, I have no deficiencies. I appreciate yout concern, but I am not trying to be unhealthy with weight loss.

I do acknowledge that I have some disordered thoughts and behaviours and I am trying to overcome them. I am not using this sub to fuel my disordered thoughts in any way - in fact, some of them are rooted in fatlogic. But we need to separate this from the facts re my weight,"

I sympathise with heroin addicts suffering homelessness etc because of their addiction, even though the homelessness may be viewed as a ""natural consequence"" to it. Some people are obese because they are secret eaters and don't realise how much they are overeating. Others may have binge eating disorder and want to change. Even fat activists may be defensive and arrogant because they're lying to themselves and they know deep down that they are faced with problems."

fatlogic,ffb4cmp,t1_ffaxpc6,1579751461.0,Thanks ahaha. I know I have a problem with overeating - oatmeal fills me up for the whole day. My night binges are mostly psychological. I agree that I need to cut down and find a way to listen to my hunger.

fatlogic,ffaq8s5,t3_esd9hw,1579741947.0,Silly question: is it fatlogic to eat a large breakfast? I eat about 1.1-1.2 metric cups of oatmeal every morning (380-414 cal) and it’s probably more calories because I sometimes add a bit more. I eat it even if I’m bloated from stuffing myself the night before. I’m wondering whether it’s fat logic to overeat like this every morning.
fatlogic,ffamq8u,t1_ffajqho,1579739575.0,Don't get me wrong - it must be very annoying and embarassing to buy two seats on a plane or to feel like you're taking up too much space. That part I sympathise with. What I don't understand is why this author makes up ridiculous examples like this to back herself up.
fatlogic,ffammxz,t1_ffaluad,1579739513.0,"I have ADHD too - fidget toys and bouncing my leg help a lot. Also wriggling my toes in my shoes and taking frequent bathroom trips. I've only ever lay down on the ground once, when I passed out in a plane from severe altitude sickness. The flight attendant put me in the recovery position because I began puking. It was very uncomfortable and stanky when I lay down."
fatlogic,ffam08n,t1_ffaigth,1579739087.0,"That's really interesting, actually. I don't know whether the samples of Asians are different between the studies the organisations conducted. Also, I don't know whether either organisation controlled for things like substance use, alcoholism, carbohydrate intake. etc. which all affect health. The AACE studies may only be conducted on American Asians who may have a higher quality of life and a healthier diet. Also from my experience, rural Asian cultures may discourage seeking medical help from Western doctors, so a lot of medical cases may go unreported.

The WHO aims to reduce the global health burden, so they may have a greater focus on populations, whereas the AACE may focus more on indiidual endocrinological health. In the latter case a doctor would obviously use common sense when deciding if someone is unhealthy (i.e. if an Asian girl walks in with a BMI of 16 and she's lost her period and has osteopenia, she probably needs to gain a bit of weight). I'm curious whether individual Asians may be fine at a lower BMI, but on a population scale, this may be different.

I've got to admit that I'm not a doctor (just a dumb med student)  and am not in any way an expert in the field. I don't want to argue with you or disrespect you - I just really like scientific discussion and am always open to new ideas. You're a very insightful member of this forum, and I appreciate your concern either way."

Also when I'm 44kg and above, my BMI is above 18. At 100lb it's very close to 18.5. Right now, without bloating, I am probably 44.5 kgs. My BMI is 18 at 44.0 kg, 17.5 at 43 kg (95lb) and 17.0 at 41.7 kg (91-92 lb). The standards for average weight ate 15.5-22.9 for Asians, but there is a grey area from 15.5-17.5. I wouldn't drop under 17 BMI because aesthetically, that isn't my thing.

I do have an unhealthy relationship with food, I'll give you that. But it's mostly bingeing and purging. I have disordered thoughts and behaviours, yes, but that doesn't make the facts and figures any less true."

I know I can stop this when I reach my goal weight (it's underweight but not very severely - BMI 17). I do lose control when bingeing, but purging is a conscious act for me. I honestly started claiming an ED when I dropped below the underweight threshold. Which is stupid because I'm Asian and this is healthy for me.

I fit the criteria for Anorexia Nervosa B/P subtype, except I don't restrict that much and I sometimes gain 2-3 lb by overeating. I aim for 500 net calories but I feel successful when I eat under 1000. I get guilty above 1500. Someone with a real ED would get guilty at 501 calories. And they wouldn't count net calories.

Physically I am healthy - maybe a little too fat. I don't look skinny - in fact, most people say that I look healthy/normal/chubby. I'm only slightly underweight by BMI. You can't see my ribs. I have fat flabby thighs and a round stomach. I get my period every so often and my heart rate is normally 50-59 resting. My hair doesn't fall out that much. I've never passed out. There are people a lot sicker than me who deserve help.

Mentally I feel fine. I do get these thoughts, that if I don't weigh xx kg for my exams I'll fail, but everyone has them. I also feel like people are judging my fat body whenever I go out. I also have nightmares where I'm bingeing or people are telling me that I'm fat. I cancel a lot of social engagements because there will be food, or because I feel fat and unworthy.

1200isplenty,fdzs38n,t1_fdso0qm,1578794476.0,I'm 17 and have a liver problem where I can't drink. I've lost friends over this.
fatlogic,fdzgv5p,t1_fdz1bc5,1578790093.0,"No thanks I’d rather control my weight and tie it down under my set point. When I was 13 I was at my set point weight and ate intuitively. I had depression, high blood pressure, period pain, joint problems and no friends."
fatlogic,fdzgt3k,t1_fdzfulp,1578790071.0,I get anxious when I diet and get skinny. I get depressed when I’m fat. I like anxiety more than depression so I control my weight.
EDAnonymous,fdyq948,t1_fdyq1ol,1578782485.0,Sorry for the downer message I just woke up when I wrote it
fatlogic,fdybrrf,t1_fdxmtsp,1578778061.0,"Yes, when I'm heavier I find that I get depressed and suicidal. Weight loss is the only thing that makes it stop."
fatlogic,fdybdvs,t3_endjcj,1578778008.0,"I work hard to maintain my weight because I know that if I let myself go and intuitively eat, I will become morbidly obese. So what if I dedicate my whole life to it? Weight loss is one of my passions."
EDAnonymous,fdyas5v,t1_fdyaf6e,1578777806.0,I mean I never restrict and only overeat (very rarely purge) so objectively I don’t really deserve to eat as much as I’m eating.
EDAnonymous,fdyamjc,t1_fdwv2zs,1578777743.0,Same when I was 8 I got teased for my lunches and my friends were teaching each other to purge and they were too embarrassed to let me eat near them.
EDAnonymous,fdyad96,t1_fdvy6g2,1578777694.0,No I was being a selfish waste of life and talking about myself. I’m a massive narcissist and lack all compassion.
EDAnonymous,fdy9qee,t1_fdwkk2d,1578777529.0,Secret eating is the reason I’m a plump failure
EDAnonymous,fdy9och,t1_fdy1aqo,1578777508.0,I always hide in a corner when I’m eating or get a salad.
EDAnonymous,fdy9lyi,t1_fdxnuvr,1578777483.0,I don’t have legitimate anorexia so I always overeat in public. And I never purge. I’m not like visibly skinny tho so people don’t notice.
EDAnonymous,fdy9hh8,t1_fdxlvh2,1578777437.0,I’m so sorry to invalidate your struggles. That sounds absolutely awful and like hell. Your ed is valid regardless of your weight
EDAnonymous,fdy9ck9,t1_fdvtwcf,1578777386.0,I am so sorry that happened to you omg. Stupid bitches don’t have anything better to do
EDAnonymous,fdy4eyv,t1_fdvi7gq,1578776021.0,">This emotional gymnastics has no benefit

Mental illness...is useless and toxic?? What is this sorcery?

Seriously tho thanks for the logic. It’s a pleasant surprise when your ed is bombarding you with irrationality"
