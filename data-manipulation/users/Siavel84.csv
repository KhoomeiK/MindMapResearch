I still think healthcare should be socialized even though my healthcare is not lacking. I still think that people providing water to illegal immigrants in the desert shouldn't be punished even though I have enough water."
MurderedByWords,fdgkp6u,t1_fdggntg,1578400558.0,Exactly. It's also why they qualify their rain predictions with a percentage chance. A 30% chance of rain is a 70% chance of not rain.

* Asking why it is ""AVoid"", and not ""Avoid"".
* Complaining about login IDs.
* Complaining about things that mods cannot fix, such as that fifth glyph's continuation in our host platform's formatting.
* Submitting a post in which OP is using words that should contain that fifth glyph, but OP just omits it \[xmpl of omission\] or subs a stand-in symbol \[lik- th' usag\_ h3r3\]. 

I know that our info bar only displays this info if you look at this forum via its ""old"" layout and folk unfamiliar with that layout won't know to do so, so I would also fancy a link to an HTML doc that lists our community laws and information. Or mayhaps u/AvoidBot could auto-post this info."
