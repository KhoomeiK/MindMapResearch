worldnews,ffzguq7,t1_ffz8nv8,1580378434.0,"You were talking about 1857 as well, unless you were referring to Gandhi's peaceful rebellion as ""one of the bloodiest""."
nottheonion,ffuwoj8,t1_ffuiwfi,1580250765.0,"If it's not ""cheaper or healthier or better"" then what the hell's the problem? Nobody would buy it if it's as bad as you say it is. Something tells me you're wrong and chicken from the US would probably be much cheaper. They have a reputation for that.

Also, even alcohol produced under regulations is more dangerous than chlorinated chicken so why not ban all alcohol?"
nottheonion,ffuixhk,t1_ffudyrg,1580242926.0,">I'd be fine with that if the law said the package was required to have a giant label that says ""THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OR WAS TREATED WITH CHLORINE. CHLORINE IS KNOWN TO CAUSE _______ IN HUMAN TRIALS.""

But that would be a lie as even the EFSA [agrees chlroinated chicken poses no threat to our bodies](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.297)."
nottheonion,ffuilan,t1_fftkgqn,1580242717.0,And what's the counterargument to that because it seems like a pretty good point to me? Alcohol is sooooo much worse to your body than chlorinated chicken will ever be.

worldnews,ffqnb03,t1_ffqlsj6,1580139098.0,"No, we shouldn't ""do nothing"". We should listen to the proper authorities, that's all. The IPCC for example says we should get to net zero by 2050. That's a reasonable target."
worldnews,ffql2r4,t1_ffqj75o,1580137494.0,"I'm not a conservative and the only troll here is you. I refuse to believe you don't know the difference between ""collapse in the next 20 years"" and ""collapse in the 21st century"". You know the difference, you just act like you don't because you're arguing in bad faith.

And not only does that book not say what you think it says, but it's also been dismissed by academics as a doomsday prophecy."
worldnews,ffqidjs,t1_ffqi1t0,1580135437.0,Can you answer my question though? Or do you expect me to read a 400 pages book in a language I don't understand? You're more delusional than I thought.
worldnews,ffqh3u5,t1_ffqch29,1580134418.0,"Ok, so where exactly in all this mumbo jumbo am I supposed to read about the world collapsing in the next 20 years? Is it in the 400 pages french book?"
worldnews,ffq79vk,t1_ffpznhw,1580124247.0,That last point you choose to ignore is so outrageously stupid it makes the whole speech a joke.

Net zero emissions? Now that's different."

Yeah, I agree. But everyone should know how bad Trump is now. And only 54% of berniebros supporting the democratic nominee after 4 years of Trump is absolutely disgusting."

MurderedByWords,ffcbqpt,t1_ffcam7s,1579796012.0,"Oh wow, is that really your argument? Of course the bank paid that interest with the profits made from their business. How the fuck else are they supposed to pay it?

Using your same logic, the bailout was not actually to the banks, but to the people, because the money that was received by the banks was distributed to people, because you know that's what banks do, they lend money. It's a dumb argument.

The bailout saved us from another Great Depression, and also made the government some extra bucks. Most economists agree that it was the right thing to do."
MurderedByWords,ffc7wjw,t1_ffc71y6,1579793578.0,How in the blue hell did YOU pay that interest? Explain.
