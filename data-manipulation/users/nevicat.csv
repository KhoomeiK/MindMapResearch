fatlogic,ffed6vw,t3_et3f6y,1579843733.0,I feel a little richer now that I spend less on food. does that count?
fatlogic,ffcnqzc,t1_ff9rpc3,1579803370.0,excellent work!
loseit,ff9nmnx,t1_ff8wfly,1579716770.0,"I started biking to work this past summer, with a similar time of about 20 minutes. I also started IF/skipping breakfast to help combat my large-bagel-with-cream-cheese habit, and found that drinking water when I got to work helped a lot--even if I didn't think I was thirsty. I also like to have black coffee once I'm at work to help get through to lunch time. it took a little while to adjust, for sure. over the summer/fall I was able to do longer fasted rides, around 1-1.5 hours. I always bring a snack though, just in case."
fatlogic,ff76u9u,t1_ff6uuqf,1579642272.0,"I think you can end up with a decreased number of beta cells with type 2, due to damage from sustained inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. the mechanism is currently under study, but the result would be insufficient insulin production that could be supplemented by injection."
loseit,ff70mjf,t3_ero09b,1579638742.0,"good on you for switching surgeons. how terrible to imply you couldn't do the work and suggest additional risk via surgery. 

I'm glad you've got a good relationship with your endo--I think it's really important to be able to discuss symptoms with someone who will listen, especially for thyroid issues. finding the right balance with meds can be tricky, and often symptoms are the first indicator that something might be up.

great work!"
loseit,ff6xo19,t3_erwj5x,1579637014.0,"one of my why's is just being done with obese. I've been obese most of my life, and realizing I was at a BMI of 39 was my I'm-done-with-this moment. I want to try out life in the normal BMI range. 

in the day to day realm, I remind myself that time will pass either way, so do I want today to help support my goal (deficit) or am I ok with a little slow down (maintenance). I try to avoid framing days as ""cheat days,"" and instead try to work at maintenance levels to accommodate... well, life. 

lately I've been finding ways to work in more exercise since winter has dampened my cycling plans. for me that's been walking home (2.5 miles) some days, and waking more on the weekends. it doesn't always need to be high intensity or early morning gym (which I know myself well enough to not attempt, ha)."
fatlogic,ff6u1be,t3_eryxo6,1579634871.0,"thermogenesis also burns some calories, but I'd rather go for a walk than stand still outside in sub zero temps to burn energy."
fatlogic,ff6try3,t3_erzds2,1579634718.0,"dietary fats get emulsified into chylomicrons, from which free fatty acids are deposited at adipose tissue and the remnants are taken up by the liver. in the liver, fatty acid synthesis can occur, and fatty acids are then taken by VLDL to adipose/other tissues.

it depends on your metabolic needs, I.e. if you have low blood glucose, fatty acids in the liver will be used to fuel ATP production and gluconeogenesis. if your blood glucose is sufficient, excess energy (glucose and fats) are stored as fatty acids. muscle can also use fatty acids as an energy source, but I think some portion of dietary fats are likely stored as fat--it's an efficient energy storage."
fatlogic,ff6su82,t3_erw0ky,1579634166.0,"why do the only options seem to be a) if you're working to lose weight/be fit you must hate yourself or b) the only way to love yourself is to ignore/accept your weight and accept that weight gain is inevitable.

why can't I love mysepf whatever my size, while also working to lose weight and be more fit? because, I'm pretty sure that's how I feel. my decision to lose weight was entirely because I want to treat myself better than I had been, and I want to enjoy doing more active-things."
fatlogic,ff6p5a3,t1_ff6oz7m,1579631957.0,"I think it's a pika. I mean, pikachu sounds just like a pika."
fatlogic,ff4kxxf,t1_ff4bdth,1579566117.0,yes. several people have pointed this out. I concede the point: I certainly have never had the opportunity to ride a horse and have little knowledge of the requirements.
SelfAwarewolves,feza7zb,t3_eqy1xh,1579455266.0,"it only counts if its *on purpose,* not a side effect. no one's trying to change the climate here, so it obviously can't be human-driven."
fatlogic,feyryja,t1_feyq1b9,1579449839.0,"that makes sense. I've never heard it described as ""excellent"" exercise before, but then again I don't really know any equestrians, professional or otherwise. 

do horse riders generally do strength exercises outside of riding to help improve their performance?"
fatlogic,feyppn3,t1_feypa12,1579448878.0,"is that true for a galloping horse too? I knew trotting was the part that requires some leg muscle, but it still seems like a very small, muscle specific type of exercise.

edit to add: by ""small, muscle specific"" I meant it didn't seem like a full body workout. as has been pointed out, it requires leg and core muscles to be done well. I still think the horse might be getting more exercise--cardio and weight lifting!"
fatlogic,feyopiy,t3_eqvdn9,1579448435.0,"horse riding is an excellent form of exercise? do they mean for the horse? 

granted, I'm sure certain muscle groups are used to keep your balance, but it's basically sitting. bumpy sitting."
fatlogic,fev2vp7,t3_eqnw7s,1579392538.0,"not all sugar is the same, and it's not processed the same biochemically: glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, galactose, sucrose, these are different trips of sugar.

part of the reason fructose is problematic is it enters the glycolic pathway, but doesn't generate the same insulin response that glucose does, and therefore effects you differently. 

some people lack the enzyme that processes lactose, and a small percentage of babies are born without an enzyme needed to breakdown galactose, which can be fatal if not identified.

saying all sugar is sugar is reductive and simply wrong."
fatlogic,feuuo15,t3_eqi4rp,1579390115.0,"*Yes it takes work but it IS possible.*

ditto weight loss, turns out."
fatlogic,fel9svp,t3_eppewe,1579217191.0,"see: *biochemistry*

dammit."
loseit,feka4xm,t1_fejvi1e,1579195781.0,"that's a good reminder too!

I tried my first spin class last month (after cycling all summer/fall!) and wow... my legs hurt for two and a half *days*. this past week I did my second and third sessions with only a little soreness the next day, but the stats slow I've put in more work each time."
loseit,fejsjtu,t1_fejpvqt,1579184799.0,*wi-fi
fatlogic,fej1r24,t1_feiycr8,1579153748.0,A-line looks so weird on me.
fatlogic,feixzw4,t3_epe33v,1579150354.0,"""When we say an item of clothing is “flattering,” we usually mean it’s slimming.""

I thought it just meant it looks good on them, on their particular body? I didn't realize good always means thin and bad always means fat."
fatlogic,fehjq21,t1_fehc4q0,1579117945.0,our brain cells and red blood cells literally run on carbohydrates. it's called glycolysis.
