Just thought I’d throw that in there, as there’s a lot of misinformation about St. Louis out there."
AskAnAmerican,fem5it3,t1_fem0w94,1579240487.0,"I would like to say that a lot of this is confined to the northern part of the city limits. Most of the city, including downtown, south STL, and midtown where SLU is through to Forest Park and WashU, is very pleasant and doesn’t look like a ghost town.

Beyond this, the county is very nice. West County is home to some of the wealthiest and safest suburbs in the country. Even north county is doing well. 

Really, outside of East St. Louis (which is an entirely different city) and north of downtown, it’s a super nice place to live. We have a bunch of free attractions, including the Zoo and art and history museums, the city museum downtown, the Gateway Arch, two world champion sports teams, two top-flight universities, and a ton of good places to eat and drink.

“A lot of it” being a ghost town is just untrue.

Yeah... that's the point. It's called character development. JJ was pointing out that Luke had grown and realized that how he had been acting in the last movie was wrong."
StarWars,fe2ptga,t1_fdzv0cc,1578841600.0,Yep. And now TFA is generally seen positively now that everyone hates VIII and IX so much more. I guess we'll just have to wait ten years and the sequels will get their due.
