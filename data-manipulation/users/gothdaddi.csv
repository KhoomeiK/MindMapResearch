TargetedShirts,fferbok,t1_ffen75q,1579861676.0,It’s almost as though you’re a cis person with absolutely no concept of what it’s like to struggle with gender. Almost. It’s like you’re trying to be oblivious to people unlike yourself.
TargetedShirts,ffeeb51,t1_ffe4emr,1579844818.0,"“Trans-slender” is absolutely not a thing, and it’s a play on “transgender,” which is absolutely a thing. Co-opting the identities and words of a community you’re not a part of in an attempt at irreverence is at best not funny, at the worst offensive. Remember when we were using the word *wigger* to describe white people who acted black? Turns out that’s 100% racist. 

Also, the idea that somebody *is* fat but they identify as skinny, therefore they are trans-whatever implies that trans folks are actually their birth-assigned gender, they just identify differently. 

This shirt is an unfunny mess."

television,fdjf3uh,t3_eldap5,1578468138.0,"Honestly, this show has done a lot for me. A friend told me to start watching because, “You’re basically David Rose.”

As a queer person who’s always had a hard time dating a lot of cis-hetero women, David’s arc and his view of sexuality is a moment of clarity for a lot of people who have a hard time seeing romance outside of a binary.

The moment he has when he’s comparing his sexuality to wine is something that resonated deeply, and a reference that has made me a lot easier to understand.

So thanks, Schitt’s Creek. You’re making the world a better place disguised as brilliant character comedy."

Nobody wants to hear this: billionaires are unlike us, and they don’t give a fuck about us. Everybody reading this has more in common with any given member of the working class than a billionaire, and they are so fucking pleased if you’re a dumb enough motherfucker to turn against your own class to serve their self interests.

news,fbin4sk,t1_fbi935b,1576906289.0,"Can confirm. I used to be in a youth-based alternative court, and would usually go watch trails if I got done early. I got to know who the public defenders were, and always looked forward to the questioning/cross of the defendant in those situations. You could see the headache grow on these poor soul’s faces as the defendants regularly just gave new, non-coached information during the questioning by *their own lawyer*. My favorite one was a guy who admitted to stabbing his wife in the leg, but only because he was *trying to cut an orange she had sitting on her leg.*

Somehow that one was a hung jury. Justice is funny."
