clevercomebacks,fgr02pd,t1_fgqwiex,1581035191.0,I understand where you are coming from. They do have more in common than I'd think before you put it that way.
clevercomebacks,fgqvx4x,t1_fgqv9fr,1581032620.0,"Of course white supremacists are worse, but I'm not sure those two positions really relate to one another very much. Yes, they are both some form of superiority complex, but I feel like the root causes of each are so different. I wouldn't even think to associate the two, aside from both being able to somehow technically fulfill the term ""superiority complex""."

quittingkratom,fgpth2d,t1_fgps66u,1581011680.0,That sounds like a very thoughtful and fair way to look at it. Thanks for clarifying your opinion and I'm happy you're figuring out what works for you and what doesn't.
politics,fgpqrm8,t3_ezqmpl,1581010180.0,Can we stop being vectors of the narrative that we should tolerate even the possibility of Trump refusing to leave office? Merely etertaining the idea is a step toward tolerating it. This is how propaganda works.
quittingkratom,fgpqjbn,t3_enfslo,1581010054.0,"Thinking of you and proud of you. I'm very sorry for your loss, I know how painful it is."
quittingkratom,fgpps4z,t1_ffvdy86,1581009632.0,"Kratom can be very helpful, depending on a person's discipline and how it affects each person. I find that opiates have drastically different effects, person to person. I choose not to use it anymore, but it helped me get through a lot. People need more information, it needs to be studied, and people need to know themselves better. They need self control and need to honestly assess themselves and their choices. No doubt, certain ways if using kratom can be extremely destructive, but just because some people have harmed themselves with it, doesn't mean it should be demonized or branded good or bad. That is absurd. It is an object; just like a knife, a food or any other drug. Sorry for the rant. I don't mean to single anyone out, and I know you are celebrating someone's success, which is an amazing thing! I'm new to the sub and just thinking about a lot of things. Thank you for reading; I mean this comment with kindness."
quittingkratom,fgpitnc,t3_ezmw1j,1581005652.0,"Is there a point when you realized your body and mind totally were clean of the kratom's influence? I don't mean mental habit and craving, but a a point when you realized it was out of your body completely, and your mind was back to where it was?

Kratom gave me such happiness and relief in tough times, but it wasn't worth the days after, where the problem I was treating with kratom would just come back but worse. I think it should be legal, but it didn't have a healthy place in my life. I wish it did, because it helped when I needed comfort."

And I agree, we have a responsibility with this knowledge. Everything is perfect, but always room for improvement. People need help and we need to do what we can to help them. Very happy to know you're out there, trying to do that with me."

terencemckenna,fgmfn9z,t1_fgmbik7,1580923568.0,"Wow that's awesome. I felt the presence of a benevolent, merciful, motherly presence on a DMT experience over the summer. Whenever I feel guilty for no reason or generally sad, thinking of ""her"" reminds me that I'm a good person and there's no reason to feel bad. What a gift, right?"
terencemckenna,fgmb69n,t1_fgm766t,1580921274.0,"Thank you, your process sounds a lot like Tibetan buddhist mediation technique. Starts with one pointed concentration, then insight and mantra,  and eventually deity meditation. I like the mantras, but youre probably right, that it's more complex, because I start analyzing the meaning of the mantra and get sidetracked. Maybe setting up a certain environment, like you do, would make it easier for my mind to say ""oh, it's time to meditate"". Thanks a lot for the advice. You should check out this incense called Loban. I really enjoy it. Beautiful sweet smell and some people things it helps release dopamine or some other kind of feel-good endocrine. Maybe I should try focussing on another body feeling, like you, instead of breath or mantra for a few weeks. Thanks a lot this was very helpful."
blackmagicfuckery,fgm6a4p,t1_fgm2tni,1580918757.0,"Right, and I'm sure the bottom isn't flat. I just thought that didn't seem very odd."
terencemckenna,fgln70s,t1_fgj41wc,1580905130.0,"Can you give a short summary of what you do once you sit on the cushion? Do you just follow your breath? Meditate on a different topic each time? Thanks for the advice you already gave, either way. I really enjoyed those podcasts, too."
ObscureMedia,fgln1qv,t3_ez2t1k,1580904982.0,That's one of my favorite YouTube channels. I really like watching the footage of old towns and restaurants.
