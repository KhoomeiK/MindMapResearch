SelfDrivingCars,ff89tnb,t1_ff7tdze,1579670277.0,"My guess is design and production schedules were laid out years ago and were based on overly optimistic timelines for Cruise software. That work continued despite slowdowns on the software. Now they have a hardware platform that isn't useful yet because the software isn't ready, and which doesn't meet government safety requirements, as they're based on human driven cars. They now have to play the waiting game on software while continuing to lobby for changes in regulations."
