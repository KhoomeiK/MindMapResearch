DigimonMastersOnline,ffige0u,t3_etpfbo,1579973239.0,"Other returning player here! Dont buy MC6 greater than 21M It's not a profit. Mc1 are around 5\~10m, mc2 anything less than 10m is good, mc3,4,5 10\~15m mc7 for 20m is cheap, anything under is a steal. Why am I adding this? Because you can sell all of these for 5m more than you bought them, the mc3,4,5 might not sell as fast though but 2,6,7 will sell like hotcakes.  If you have MC6 sell the Marine Devimon seals for 89\~90m. They're rare. Money in the maze? Kill Giromon and sell their seals for 10\~15m. Diaboromon don't drop expensive seals, but I know it gives ok coin drop at the top. But I'm not too sure it's worht the grind just to get it.

Check shops EVERY day, get used to prices, lots of things changed. DON'T KILL YOUR BOSS CARDS. There's relics now. They don't drop anything anymore anyway. Anything you kill in maze=profit and good xp now

Also level cap from loot has been removed so you can now farm any digimon with any level digi."
DigimonMastersOnline,ffheukd,t1_ffhax2m,1579932323.0,"But a VERY important note before that. There used to be a really common place to use monster cards: Western village. Western Village and Snowstorm Village used to be hotspots for people to chill find carding groups and you'll always pass by newbies. It put you in their path so they can see, and ask what they need to. And the game is HEAAAAVYYYYY P2W now. You used to be able to sustain yourself EASILY F2P. They removed the ability to summon monster cards in areas now(Yes I know ""Spirits"" can be summoned those who pick detail, but nobody really cares about them anymore.) They erased one of the only few ways inexperienced players passed by beginners. I do my best to communicate with beginners though. Half the time they just ignore me XD If you have a discord, feel free to message me your discord ID and It'd be a much better way to communicate."
DigimonMastersOnline,ffgw3c3,t1_ffglnc6,1579916544.0,No problem. Most people don't care to explain things to beginners and then they wonder why nobody new is joining dmo?
DigimonMastersOnline,fffzoh8,t1_ffbx6m8,1579895306.0,"Hey there, me again. Crowns is cash shop currency, game is very P2W in a way. Ok so to set up a shop there will be a man when you're coming down the slope into the DATS building, and he will be in the very middle. He will sell a shop licence, which you can sell 3 items total at this, But you must be online to sell (yeah it's dumb). Idk what rank your starter digi is but he's decently strong I'd put him at maybe a 4/5 in power level. You can't scan regular eggs to get mid data. There are other ways to get it though. Through Events, Daily rewards (data will be marked (MID))  Not sure about dungs im not too familiar with them. Okay so to identify your chips you have to go to an attribute merchant and you can Identify them there. To find this person you can press (m) to open your map and look for (npc). Keep scrolling down until you see someone named Attribute Merchant and you can identify the chips for your clothing so you can start benefiting from them.   


Important note about scanning: ONLY scan data. Buy food from venders. Other eggs are basically useless for you at the moment. So scan eggs that say ""DATA"" not ones that say ""possible data"", return them. Eggs you have that have a bright blue background with a digimon name are eggs you can possibly hatch (like you did in the tuitorial with kunemon, but not as easy. They will break. A lot. Don't worry too much about those that you find and put them in your warehouse. There's a cool event going on where if you press the (e) button you can see the events going on for the day/period. You will get a free GARENTE LV3\~LV5 (Lv3 being small and LV5 being large and stronger) egg. Also Size %= how strong your digi is. So If you have a Digimon at 80% Size, he's 20% weaker then his average self. But if you have a digimon that has 120% size, he's 20% stronger.   


Focus on collecting data for these eggs because they are MUCH stronger then your tuitorial Kunemon, unless you're connected to him I'd not put too much focus into leveling him and just your starter. One last thing, you're still VERY new into the game and it's not too late to re-join a different server, I know a decently low leveled guild that'll take you in and I could help you out along the way. Just food for thought though, I know some people dislike starting over so early in a game because it can feel very repetitive.  

On another note, it's great to see new players get into the game. The community really neglects beginners as it is now because they're so absorbed in their P2W paradise.   
Oh crap I forgot to press send lsat night. Whoops."
DigimonMastersOnline,ffbetip,t3_esdn5j,1579762219.0,"1. Guilds are a nice start.
2. Don't buy crowns too soon, wait until you have a good understanding in what you might need.
3. Take your time looking around at shops, if you see something you might like look and see if it's cheeper on another ch/shop
4. Type /shopfinder (Text in a shop name) To highlight all shops possibly selling that item. For example, Monster cards are abbreviated with  ""MC"" So looking up that you'll see a variety of different shops selling.
5. Having a 3/5 Digi is perfectly fine. Just don't invest too heavily into it.
6. You can clone your digimon to give it increased stats, try to only do this on 4/5 5/5 eggs.     
7.  Those numbers are the level of data imputs.8)Only scan data eggs, you can tell the quality of egg in it's description.
8. Create an alt account to store tradeable items. In the warehouse you will see a 2 row bar at the bottom of it, you can trade that across other accounts on the same server. I mostly use mine for Digieggs and Seals. Don't worry about seals too much for now, more of a later kinda thing.
9. Digimon 6\~7 levels below your digi will give a lot less experience.
10. Having a hard time finding Evoulters? Become social and peppy with a high level player and have him do your monster cards for you :D The red orbs that drop are evoulters.
11. Don't be afraid to stock up on food/drink. Saves you the hassle of running around. If you have any other questions just reply with things I might of missed and I'll try to cover it after I fall asleep. Btw which server are you on? If you're on Lilithmon I can help you with anything you might need. But odds are you are in Omega lol"

You are young enough in a low enough pay salary to probably join.[https://www.joinjobcorps.com/gen/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAxrbwBRCoARIsABEc9si56t0pUzKHm\_q5Ihhe087uiezFiEzEB4g-\_DbHhDe8xrWBtggjuqcaAjviEALw\_wcB](https://www.joinjobcorps.com/gen/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAxrbwBRCoARIsABEc9si56t0pUzKHm_q5Ihhe087uiezFiEzEB4g-_DbHhDe8xrWBtggjuqcaAjviEALw_wcB)I went there when my dad lost his apartment, there might be a recruiter near you to speak to, or you can call them.It'll let you start your life over, and they provide high school classes to get your diploma and trade school to help you support yourself. Along with some areas giving Advance training and College, it's a great opportunity.

Job Corps won't be a wonderland, drama always exists no matter where you go, but it will help you a lot. They also have many supportive people on center to help you, living on-center and some things to do on your down time. There's always a chance to start fresh. I gave my friend this suggestion when she was suicidal and with an abusive boyfriend, she's on her way to becoming a dentist now. I don't know too much about you but I know all you need is a little help in the right direction, hope you see this."
