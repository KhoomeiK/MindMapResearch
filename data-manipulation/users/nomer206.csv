BlackPeopleTwitter,ffdm2e5,t1_ffctbij,1579823764.0,A teenager at my school was killed while crossing the street after her friend who works at Burger King asked her to ride her bike over on her lunch break and have lunch with her there.  She called in sick  the next day. It was her BEST friend and she felt like she caused that poor girls death—and what did Burger King management do the next day when she didn’t go to work? They BITCHED HER OUT.  And she went back to work the next day.  What the actual fuck.
