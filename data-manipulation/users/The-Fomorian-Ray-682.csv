AskReddit,fepg93d,t3_eq48n1,1579319734.0,"I had an aunt who I never met, since she lived somewhere around the 1940’s or 50’s, but she was a liberal in Colombia who lived in a small town. Now, here in Colombia in that time there was a huge conflict between liberals and conservatives, she was a liberal and tried to get more rights to the farmers in the country (my grandfather was a farmer). Now, the thing is the reaction it had, she fought for what she believed, a hero to my family, but what was described to me was horrifying. She was hung at the center of the town and her breasts had been cut off."
