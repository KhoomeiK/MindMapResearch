I would not say there is no reason or evidence to believe it. That’s just blindly believing a body that has lied in the past and will lie in the future. I’m not trying to be sensational or anything but if there’s some government fuckery going on and people are trying to speak out, shouldn’t we treat them seriously until disproven?"

I like being high up with a veiw, on the fourth floor overlooking a small park. It's beautiful and the city does I great job of maintaining it. 

Ik most apartments don't have great views so that's obviously specific to my experience but it did make me appreciate public space a lot more. One night after a bit of cannabis enjoyment I was looking outside at the fountain with the street lights illuminating the trees and grass, thinking damn that's pretty neat to have a fountain and well maintained garden in your front yard. Like that's what rich people with massive homes do. I'm never going to have a mansion but I least I can feel like it with a shared space like that."

Futurology,fffsiy5,t1_fffi3ad,1579890852.0,"At the expense of the fucking environment. That’s the cost of raising this speed limit. More wetlands drained, more streams ditched. It should be more expensive for the company, it should be more expensive for us. Water is a precious fucking resource, biodiversity is important, the overall health of our ecosystems are valuable and if protecting it is gonna make things slightly more expensive then it what we need to do. It won’t kill the economy if a developer has to pay a bit more to build something. People act like these 2015 WOTUS rules forbid all this development and progress and Trump is making it workable again, that’s not the case."
Futurology,fffby4d,t1_fffa1gc,1579880591.0,"Properly regulating streams and wetlands will not hurt the economy. Yes it will make developing land more expensive but that’s a good thing, that means the costs aren’t as externalized and folks are more incentivized to avoid negative impacts.

It’s literally my job to tell companies what’s on their land and what permits they need to build their projects. The vast majority of projects can be done without impacting streams and wetlands, it’s just more difficult. It’s disingenuous to say that these regulations hurt the economy. It’s like Fedex fighting to increase speed limits bc they can marginally increase their profits by driving faster."

> They focus their efforts on Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) enforcement although they are empowered to enforce all laws of the state. Their mission encompasses two broad enforcement areas: fish & wildlife and environmental quality. Fish & wildlife enforcement includes addressing complaints of poaching, the illegal sale of endangered species, and checking hunters, fishermen, trappers and commercial fishermen (lobsters, clams, bait fish, food fish) for compliance. Environmental quality enforcement includes investigating timber thefts, illegal water pollution, improper use or application of pesticides, commercial vehicles producing excessive emissions, freshwater and saltwater wetland degradation, illegal mining and almost any area that affects air, land or water quality law violations."

The media landscape as a whole certainty does not, they will **always** find someone that pays attention, positive or negative. We as a society cannot possibly think it’s possible to get *everyone* to ignore it. And that’s what you’d essentially need for your approach to work. Near unanimous agreement among the media consuming public to ignore this stuff. It’d be amazing if that would work but that’s just not going to happen. They will get attention, people will react.
