Upvote this comment because anything anti-antivax=hilarious. This is an objectively good comment, because that's how this all works I guess."

Reddit's new dominant culture is transgenderism. Not subscribing to that new ideology is obviously the counter-culture. That's just facts."
Cringetopia,fggvd9x,t1_fgg0bot,1580770404.0,"> you do everything right maybe it dies anyway.

eh, not really, barring actual medical conditions.

SIDS is just a fancy way of saying ""Yeah, sometimes new mothers break under the stress and that's totally understandable, so we're giving them an easy out for doing what anybody might do under those conditions."""

DarkHumorAndMemes,fggpf5t,t1_fgfb0tg,1580766679.0,Boomers have no idea what transgender is. That concept doesn't exist to them. This is basic counter-culture.
TrueOffMyChest,fgfbqp9,t1_fgf8i85,1580733658.0,"That's straight up not true. Those statistics are beyond fucked because of the duluth model and similar mindsets. Female abusers are much less likely to be placed into the statistics, and because the statistics say there are less female abusers, less people are willing to believe there are female abusers, which leads to there being less cases where female abusers are placed into the statistics, which..."
suspiciouslyspecific,fga8oo2,t1_fg873en,1580648226.0,"Porn is about more than just nudity, but yes, there is nudity. There's this whole body painting category. Then there's just the ""mostly nude"" attire that's considered fine because nipples and such are technically covered up.

There's been some pretty messed up intercourse going on, fully allowed. There's a 5-10 minute compilation out there of all the times this one cam girl let her dog hump her."
suspiciouslyspecific,fg8621a,t1_fg704nv,1580610480.0,Twitch has been full of cam girls for a long time now.

todayilearned,ffzg9ah,t1_ffzd5qj,1580377570.0,"I'm not sure how many ways it has to be spelled out for you.

When they're gathering the HIV statistics, they're not accurately labeling whether the positive diagnosis is referring to a gay person because they're just getting an HIV test, not a diagnosis of gayness. You're less likely to label yourself as gay when you're gay at the doctor, and that skews the statistics."
todayilearned,ffzfw6k,t1_ffzf65d,1580377039.0,"No, racism is the belief that there are differences. You're thinking of prejudice. That's a pretty common mistake."
todayilearned,ffzfnh8,t1_ffzeptn,1580376682.0,"I love so much how people accidentally came back around to the original definition of racism, which is just that ""races exist"".

And now they're trying to say races don't exist because races have mixed enough to make it real complicated."
insaneparents,ffxze96,t3_evpbls,1580335446.0,"So, why is it that in all of these outrage subreddits where people black out the names, they're always clearly visible?

Is this just some openly defied rule that none of the mods don't care about? ""Like, alright, it kind of looks like you made an effort to not dox this person, and I'd rather they be doxxed anyway, so you're good."""
TrueOffMyChest,ffx86t1,t3_evigjf,1580319772.0,"Your experience is the norm. You've seen first-hand how people don't want to hear about it not being devastating. They get very spiteful about you not aiding their narratives.

That, and people have less reason to write stories about how they did the thing and everything was fine. People don't share those stories because they're not emotionally compelling. They don't get attention because ""Well, nothing happened"" is not news.

This is nothing to feel guilty about."
cursedimages,ffubb9i,t1_ffu4uba,1580238377.0,"Hey, buddy. I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't think it's particularly acceptable to use any event as an excuse to push your fetish shit on people or be hyper-sexual in public. That doesn't change based on your sexuality. Stop trying to turn any criticism of that kind of thing into an attack on homosexuality. That's an ugly mindset to have.
