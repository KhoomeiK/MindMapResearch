I have pretty much the exact same story. Dad is an alcoholic/drug addict that hasn’t really been in my life at all. Mom got remarried when I was around 9. He’s unpredictable, he’s rude, he’s mean, and he has been physical before. Anytime I ever said a bad word about him, mom would get upset. I also moved out when I was 19, saw him less, and he still refers to me as his daughter, etc.

It’s your wedding. It’s your choice. It’s your life. If you don’t want him in it, you don’t have to. Sometimes cutting off toxic people can “rock the boat” for a while, but you need to do what’s best for you."
bipolar,fd9kufv,t1_fd7agiw,1578234769.0,I’m sorry that happened! I have heard about those two and refused to take them. I only have occasional hallucinations that aren’t too bad. I just wish I could find one that didn’t have terrible side effects but still helped.
bipolar,fd9k8fx,t1_fd6xnj3,1578234570.0,I’m glad the Abilify is working! Unfortunately I had the side effect of muscle spasms which I was told can be considered a major (bad) side effect.
bipolar,fd6g7nc,t1_fd2cud5,1578190515.0,"It’s such a good feeling to not be alone with this. The whispers and music are bad enough... but the damn shadow people. In my last house, I got so paranoid about a specific closet and one watching me while I slept that I had to completely change my house around."
ptsd,fc5tx6z,t1_fc5ky2y,1577465801.0,"That specific medication made my depression much worse (to dangerous levels) and my doctor wouldn’t help me get off it. While I was trying to find a new doctors, which was an ordeal within itself, I tried weaning off it. I was dumb at first and just quit - horrible idea. Horrendously sick, nauseous, dizzy. During those few days I couldn’t go to work or get out of bed. I ended up having to get back on it until I found someone who worked with me to switch to something else. I read on a thread somewhere that their withdrawals were worse than when they got off crack."
ptsd,fc3xdpl,t3_eg0mys,1577401074.0,Those are the WORST withdrawals I have ever had. Proud of you for sticking through with it!
