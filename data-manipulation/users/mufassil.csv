badwomensanatomy,fgy8rzf,t1_fguysya,1581180701.0,Oh gosh yes. I appreciate that sub when people with average bodies post. But it got taken over by people that clearly photoshop and spend hours at the gym daily. I want to see the body of someone mid 30s that occasionally works out because work is draining.
normalnudes,fgukvw1,t3_ejzxpz,1581123351.0,Thank you for posting this. I'm happy even at my smallest. It's nice to see I'm not alone.

badwomensanatomy,fgtonno,t1_fgskx6s,1581107325.0,"Fun fact, nipples are weird. They arent beautiful little circles. Sometimes you get these white bumps. Sometimes they fade off oddly, some are big, some are small, innies, outies... we need a sub where people post their real bodies. I thought my dimples on my hips were abnormal. Nope. I just wasnt using photoshop."

HumansBeingBros,fgspoe2,t1_fgsah05,1581089976.0,I live in a city where this is true. I passed out once from an undiagnosed blood sugar issue while driving. I hit 3 cones. No one stopped. Now I'm much better but more aware and less apt to judge shitty drivers.

socialanxiety,fgevq1x,t3_exvrlb,1580711831.0,"I didnt always have social anxiety. Or maybe I did and ita just worse now. So in college I went into a very social part of the medical field. I literally can not afford to not work or go back to school for something else. So every day I pull out every trick I've learned about acting like a functional human then go home and just hide. Yesterday a coworker had extra tickets to a play and I turned them down because I needed to detach from the world. It was too much peopling. I had to switch branches of medicine within my field because I was having such bad anxiety that my resting heart rate was tachycardic and I was constant at the doctors. I was popping my emergency anxiety meds daily just to get through the day. In a perfect world, I'd go back to school for library sciences. As an adult that seems damn near impossible because not only would.i need the money for school but also enough to pay for my house, cars, family, etc."
socialanxiety,fgev7mn,t3_exzli0,1580711259.0,This might help. I met up with someone I had casually knew in high school. We were acquaintances through a mutual friend. Fast forward a few years and we all are in the same town for college. I was talking to her and she thanked me for being the only.person that said good bye to her when I left school. I dont even remember doing that but it meant a lot to her apparently. You make impacts on the world in ways you dont even realize.
socialanxiety,fgev3hy,t3_exzmn6,1580711135.0,It depends on the strain for me. Certain ones make it worse while.others make me a whole ass functioning human. Avoid edibles though.

socialanxiety,fgeubwp,t3_exya4q,1580710299.0,"My mom thought it was hilarious to tell me she paid my friends. If I made a new friend, she would say, ""I didnt even have to pay this one"". It took me much too long to not be completely paranoid about that."
socialanxiety,fgeu9d1,t3_ey1khm,1580710223.0,Then you follow with something trying to redirect the co creation and come off as a bumbling idiot because they see both texts and nothing was actually wrong with the first one.

death,fg85c98,t1_fg84zrh,1580609939.0,It's really difficult to watch. I really dont understand the logic that people are okay with VSED but not assisted suicide.

death,fg7wlf8,t1_fg7wdsj,1580603322.0,Thats really disheartening. Are you able to get a second opinion? COPD is really difficult to deal with to say the least.
ChristianApologetics,fg7whci,t1_fg7w1t4,1580603238.0,Not according to the dsm 5. Hopelessness is on of 8 symptoms of depression. Of which a minimum of 5 if the notes symptoms must occur over a consistent period of a minimum of 2 weeks to qualify.
insaneparents,fg7w611,t3_exegxt,1580603005.0,I was friends with my pastors kids growing up. I went to their house for the first time and broke down bawling because their family was functional.

death,fg7r0y3,t1_fg7qfss,1580599299.0,It shouldnt be. Not today. The right to die shouldnt be removed because people are uncomfortable.
ChristianApologetics,fg7moes,t1_fehkvf0,1580596237.0,Heck. This is so true. Even driving to the store. You're not 100% sure your car will make it there. That someone wont hit you. That your tire wont pop. And even once there that they will have what you need. And that the check out process will go smoothly. So many variables.
ChristianApologetics,fg7mh61,t1_feylhbm,1580596098.0,This is close to my interpretation. The big bang is completely possible. I just believe God made the beginning happen regardless of when and how.
ChristianApologetics,fg7mbat,t1_fg5hu7k,1580595985.0,Sad and depressed are vastly different.
ChristianApologetics,fg7m6f5,t3_ewqjia,1580595891.0,"Yes. I have a salty relationship with the church because I have run across so many pastors telling their congregations that Christian's cant be depressed or sick. I get that God can and will heal. But he also gave us medicine and doctors. Heck, Paul was a doctor. For anyone reading this, realize that you can be depressed and it 1000% not be your fault. You are not less of a Christian for being depressed. Talk to a psych doctor. Learn some mental tricks and potentially take meds. Its It's okay."
ProRevenge,fg7lr0n,t1_fg7le5k,1580595594.0,Also try r/christianapologetics and of course r/dankchristianmemes

death,fg7elyw,t1_fg7bllp,1580590628.0,"Its not at all. These individuals explicitly say they want to die and we remove every option they have in doing so. I've seen residents refuse medication, food and water until they ultimately starved. It's hard on them and the family. And if any one aides them in it, they go to prison."
videos,fg77w3b,t1_fg72q9y,1580586067.0,Oh gosh. It's impossible to grow that much food and work full time. I grew up on a farm and that was a family job.
death,fg6rimp,t1_fg6er4m,1580575218.0,"Honestly, that's how we are in front of family. When we are alone with them, we often try to let them know it's okay to pass if they are holding on. They we understand them. Things like that. I try not to cry or anything in front of them. If they can communicate, I just listen. If they cant, I put on their favorite shows or music and brush their hair. Treat them like a human rather than an object in the room. Also, (for legal reasons I donr do this nor do I know specific people that do), but for years nurses have pushed extra morphine to help ease them into death while not being in pain."

Vent,fg5ftst,t1_fg5bu7z,1580526321.0,"I agree with both of you. Just say something like, ""I appreciate the concern. This is a personal problem i dont feel like sharing right now. I just need some space and time. I'm safe and nothing bad happened. Just normal life stuff."""

That particular resident had a condition that caused them to be covered in blisters. They could barely sleep or be functional from pain."
