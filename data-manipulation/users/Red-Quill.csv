AbruptChaos,fghioxa,t1_fghietm,1580785700.0,"I said it isn’t the same exactly, meaning that I could be disagreeing with any aspect of the word, not just it’s definition. It’s usage is not exactly the same, thus my statement is correct. You’re being a pedantic dick"
AbruptChaos,fgheuuv,t1_fgheoxh,1580783270.0,"I’m not disagreeing with you about the meaning, just stating that the reason dethaw probably sounds correct is because people don’t use defrost in relation to food (at least not in my experience) and because another word, like “defreeze,” doesn’t exist"
