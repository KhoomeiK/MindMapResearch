apexuniversity,ffjtx2q,t3_eu0s6u,1580006837.0,"Alrighty, you did very well but If I were you I would pushed that squad more aggressively since they were afraid of you... your nades were good but that would have been the best opportunity to push while using your gas traps as cover to dodge and weave as well blind your enemies. Also you should be more confident you looked shaky have confidence in your abilities and your abilities won't betray you."

apexlegends,ffiwzul,t3_etvtkb,1579984761.0,Good clip but you have gone for the melee
ApexConsole,ffiwoz0,t3_etvug9,1579984541.0,"Alright, their a couple of things you could have done differently...you were by yourself against from what I see 2 potential squads I personally would have gone on top of building and assess the situation a little longer if they push you on top of the building it would have been a one on one and you could have had the upper hand. If it was 2 squads like I think their was you could have waited until they fought each other and shoot them from the top only to third  
Party later...if your portal is not ready yet forget your teammates if it was pick them up and continue the match."
