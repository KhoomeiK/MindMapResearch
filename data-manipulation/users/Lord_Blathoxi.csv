Not sure what you mean here. Do you mean that if one homeless person does something illegal/bad, then that means that all homeless people are bad/evil and should be gassed in gas chambers (or at least left on the street to die on their own)?

No, what I'm saying is that these types of people will go online and bitch about the homeless. Then they'll call the cops and bitch about the homeless. And they'll constantly complain about taxes. Then they'll go out and vote Republican, and vote against tax increases on the wealthy because ""the government is inefficient"" and they never give to actual causes that end homelessness (like rehab centers, shelters, housing and work programs), they give to churches that in turn contribute that money to Republican Super PACs or other organizations that actually CONTRIBUTE to increasing the homelessness problem (for instance, religious organizations that ostracize gay and trans folks, so that these kids are rejected by their families and are forced out onto the streets.

These are the people who SUPPORTED Reagan decommissioning the california mental health system, instead of increasing taxes so that it could be fully/properly funded so that those places weren't hellholes.

They say ""The homeless should just pull themselves up by their own boostraps! They're a nuisance and they're failures! They're barely even human! Are there no workhouses? Are there no prisons? You say that many can't go there, or they would rather die. Well, if they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population!""

>[This feeling](https://www.taxjustice.net/2014/10/08/money-taxation-isnt-theft/) that your pre-tax income is ‘your money’ is difficult to shake. It’s hard not to see the pre-tax figure on your payslip as representing what’s really owing to you for the work you’ve done, and hence to feel that the state is taking away from you something that is yours by right. However, a little careful reflection shows this almost universal assumption to be utterly confused. There is no sense in which you have a right to your pre-tax income.

>To see this, we have to ask what kind of right it might be supposed one has to one’s pre-tax income. Presumably, it is either a legal right or a moral right. Once we separate out these alternatives, we can see that the former option is incoherent, whilst the latter is utterly implausible.

>You clearly don’t have a legal right to your pre-tax income, as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it. This is a simple analytic truth that follows from the definition of taxation. People who don’t take pay their taxes go (or at least legally ought to go) to gaol.

>So if there is a general right to one’s pre-tax income, then it must be a moral right. But it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pre-tax income, for that would imply that the distribution of pre-tax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just, and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pre-tax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pre-tax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer. This is just an accident of the way our market economy is structured. To hold that each person has a moral right to their pre-tax income would be to hold that the market economy just happens to deliver to each person exactly what they deserve, and this is clearly not the case.

>Perhaps there are specific cases in which a person happens to deserve their pre-tax income; these would be rare and happy co-incidences in which the market happens to deliver exactly what is deserved. But the mere fact that your pre-tax income is £X does not entail that in any morally significant sense you are entitled to £X. The money the market happens to throw at you is not necessarily the money you deserve. No doubt you have worked hard for that money; no doubt you have made a contribution to the public good; you have special talents that others lack, etc. But others also work hard/are talented/make a contribution, and the market has not taken these morally significant factors into consideration in working out what to give to whom. For better or worse it’s almost certainly not fair that you have what you have relative to what others have got.

>Your pre-tax income isn’t the money you deserve; it is the money the amoral market has gifted you. A government may have cause to respect the whims of the market as a matter of practical necessity. But the state has no moral reason to respect the whims of the market. The only legitimate bar to redistribution is economic reality. Any politician who thinks it a good thing, in and of itself, to give people more of ‘their money’ is confused.


I hope that enlightens you a little bit.

> More than any of his predecessors, **Wilson took steps towards the creation of a strong federal government that would protect ordinary citizens against the overwhelming power of large corporations.**[326] He is generally regarded as a key figure in the establishment of modern American liberalism, and a **strong influence on future presidents such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson**.[2] Cooper argues that in terms of impact and ambition, **only the New Deal and the Great Society rival the domestic accomplishments of Wilson's presidency**.[327] Many of Wilson's accomplishments, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the **graduated income tax, and labor laws,** continued to influence the United States long after Wilson's death.[2] Wilson's idealistic foreign policy, which came to be known as Wilsonianism, also cast a long shadow over American foreign policy, and Wilson's League of Nations influenced the development of the United Nations.[2] Saladin Ambar writes that **Wilson was ""the first statesman of world stature to speak out not only against European imperialism but against the newer form of economic domination sometimes described as 'informal imperialism.'""**

>Your total tax bill would be $13,459.
