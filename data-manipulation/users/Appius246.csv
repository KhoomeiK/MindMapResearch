The rocks BMI is 32.5... NOW i am not saying i am the rock because 1 that would be a grandious delusion. 2 I am white as fuck 3 cause no one is that riped"
bipolar,ffryzl1,t1_ffrwj1m,1580169137.0,yea! Now I am wondering if I actually have horehounds cardio or if hacking away at ice and heavy packed snow then shoveling it is actually a hard job?
bipolar,ffrvonp,t1_ffrsab7,1580166905.0,"yea, i was trying to go on 30 minute walks everyday but I stopped doing it, I should get back into it my dog loves walks!"
bipolar,ffrvma0,t1_ffrow20,1580166860.0,I think im around 25% body fat? Which isnt bad but could be way way better... I would like to lose 40 pounds but I guess being 40 pounds over weight at 280 isnt the same as being 40 pounds over weight weighing 180?
bipolar,ffrlbzu,t1_ffrciuc,1580160398.0,"well I got muscle I guess?

I am 28"

I know what its like to have to much time on my hands, its never ending boredom until I find something."
schizoaffective,ffhucwd,t1_ffhuahc,1579954318.0,"plus i got my arms to measure 18 inches at the biggest, im still 280 pounds but like a healthier 280 if that makes sense?"
schizoaffective,ffhuahc,t3_etlfsq,1579954226.0,"your weight gain story is THE EXACT SAME as mine. Was 180 (6'4) and now I am at 280 plus or minus 5 pounds.

&#x200B;

I turned it into a plus and packed on muscle so thats an option? Started nearly 2 years ago only being able to do 5 knee pushups and now I can do over 40 full body weight pushups. If you figure the ratio of body weight 280 x .7 is how much lifted in a push up, it is the equivelant of benching 200 pounds!"
bipolar,ffhr5v7,t3_etj2k3,1579949557.0,"I agree the worst is when family members say ""God healed me, he will heal you to.""

&#x200B;

Then eventually I cave cause I hear it so much then 1 night without taking meds I look in the mirror at 2am and my pupils are going nuts and I am like ""yea no!?"" Just because your back got better doesnt prove God did it or if it just got better, and just because your back got better does not prove my bipolar is just just going to get ""cured.""

&#x200B;

Honestly had to tell them about a guy I met in a psyc ward that had just got in and had bipolar as well and while manic convinced himself he was invincible and stabbed himself in the neck with a knife. Made my aunt cry and say ""we have been telling him he could be healed!"" Well yea you have, if thats what it takes for you to realize medication literally keeps me alive... then yea, sorry not sorry?"

bipolar,ffa1bc8,t1_ff6qmp9,1579725887.0,VERY TRUE!
bipolar,ff6h0if,t1_ff6gkw0,1579627011.0,"well techniquly ""if you ONLY go hypo manic"" and not above (to mania) then you will have depression for your brain to recover from it (Best case). Always a danger that you go manic for the first time and/or go psychotic. ( worst case)

Another time a girl told me she was moving away and now i realise that she was strongly hinting at me asking her phone number when it was the last day of job training.

I have been reading stuff since I was 13 but never came across autism because there was an autistic kid that went to my school that was sort of low end on the spectrum and it just never came across my mind.

&#x200B;

But like to be classified as schizoaffective is legit because they dont know what to say it is . Some professionals dont even consider it a real illness. Then my new psychiatrist was all gun-ho to diagnose me as bipolar because ""I think you have difficulty remembering the order in which things happened."" So I just went with it.

I kind of want to see a autism specialist somewhere else then come back to this newly graduated psychiatrist and be like... so guess what... I have aspergers you idiot!"
