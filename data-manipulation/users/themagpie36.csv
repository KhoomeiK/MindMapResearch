When people compare Trump to that time they are not comparing him to literal Hitler killing millions of Jews.  What they are comparing is how the environment is now compared to how it was at the time before the war started.

The fact they have a strong enough country footbsll team means they would also have a lot of youngsters developing those core skills at a young age. 

A Mayo team would do fairly well I would say but the question is who would be willing to risk throwing their money into such a project. 

You also have the FAI coaching course which takes place in Castlebar (did when I lived there at least) so you could definitely take advantage of people willing to get some experience in taking sessions at either the youth or an senior level."

I'm from Ireland where we claim the same but it's simply not true. You import millions worth of Palm Kernel Extract (PKE) for your cattle each year and it keeps growing year on year.

So yeah you are murdering those animals PLUS the 'fluffy animals' as you call it. Whereas at least being a vegan means you aren't doing both.

Veganism requires less land overall than a meat based diet according to scientific research  so less death of 'ugly animals' as you call them and a better future for biodiversity of our planet in general."

If I remember correctly he had a freak accident where he cut top of his finger off off in a door and after his surgery he went off form a bit. Not sure if it was related but it was bad timing given his form at the time.
