iphonehelp,ff6rokv,t1_ff6dhze,1579633467.0,"i'm not sure exactly what you are looking for but it appears to be version 13.3 if i'm not wrong. i made a couple searches earlier in the day for fixes but didn't quite have time and internet was messy. finding the solution or knowing if it works the same for my iphone model is hard.

gonna quote something from a post i'm reading:

>5. Disable VPN  
>  
>One of the most common reasons that seem to cause WiFi issues has been VPN. If you have enabled via the Settings app or a VPN app, then try to disable VPN to see if it resolves the issue. You can disable VPN via the Settings app and navigate to the VPN settings to disable the Status toggle from Connected to Not Connected. If you are not able to disable it then launch the VPN app to disable VPN temporarily to figure out if it resolves the WiFi problem on your iPhone or iPad.

i have barely tried the iphone without the vpn but i disabled it early in the day and i believe while i was on a ride after that when i was going to the dentist in another city i don't visit very often, i didn't have any problems with the 4G connection. Will confirm this further tomarrow.

forgot to mention that vpn started appearing automatically after the iphone update after i have had them disabled for a very long time, so this seems like a promising explaination"
