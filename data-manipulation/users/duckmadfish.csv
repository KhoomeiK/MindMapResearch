>The whole point was to flesh out oden character and yet he skips through majority of oden life and gives more time to the wb and Roger . We still don't have the emotional connection with the scabbards as this whole flashback has been oden whitebeard and Roger

I don't think the Oden flashbacks is meant for fleshing out his character, but more on giving an insight on why Oden was so important to the Scabbards and the story of One Piece as a whole. Unlike the flashback on Robin, Law, Sanji, etc. these characters are currently alive, while Oden is dead. This is a flashback meant to push the story forward at the same time give context to why things are the way they are now. For the scabbards, they aren't the main focus of this flashback but this flashback proves their loyalty to Oden even more. 

> Wb Shanks rayliegh not going to wano makes no sense there is no excuse oda can cook up in which makes sense everybody yonko and marine know kaido is in wano

How do we know that everybody knows that Kaido is in Wano? This was 20+ years ago. We didn't know if there was Yonko's back then. The Great Pirate Age hasn't even started. I think your point makes no sense, as how can Shanks, WB, Rayleigh just go to Wano when they don't really know how to get into Wano in the first place. WB ended up in Wano by accident iirc. 

>Toki what's her purpose she's dine nothing she was born on the void yet we haven't given her any time and then then oden leaving he in wano makes no sense when crocus the world best doctor can heal her and the Roger pirates are strong as fuck she would be safer there but nope let's leave her in wano for olit convenience

Again, it feels like you're nitpicking things just for the sake of not liking them. Buggy was sick and you could say Crocus could have healed him but still got left behind. Toki's info about the void century is probably going to come later on before her death. I say this one needs more chapters to be fleshed out.

>This latest chapter makes no sense I don't get what u say oden for 5 years doing nothing even though his family nearly killed his dad was killed nope lemme dance in the streets for 5 years then when hyo is captured and wife killed even though this is so obvious that orochi is a scumbag now he decides ""I'm going to defeat ksido "" why not do that 5 years ago . And then people are gonna say ""we need context "" what context can someone please explain what does orochi have over oden which oden has to do this and why has it changed now technically wouldn't the same threat still be there now compared to 5 years . I have faith in oda but the way wano has been going on losing it but I still have faith if this is explained well in the next chapter then this is an overreaction but still this chapter wasn't good apart from the last 3 pages

Seems like nothing in this flashback makes sense to you, hence you hate it so much. Oden has been carrying some burden all on his own as said in this chapter. When Oden asked Orochi if his dad died from illness, we get a cut of Orochi smirking. So, it's not even confirmed that his dad is dead. Even tho it wasn't revealed we can speculate that Oden had bigger things in mind. And you have to remember, One Piece isn't an anime where you can solve everything through violence. This isn't the first time that this happened in the story (Shanks, Luffy) for example. Some things I can think of that Oden would endure 5 years of humiliation. 

a. His dad is still alive

b. Oden thinks opening the borders by overthrowing Orochi would still be too early.

c. Oden is preventing the slaughter of people by the hands of Kaido

d. Something else entirely"
