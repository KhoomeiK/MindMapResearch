I can actually see myself doing what you did, now that I think of it. If one of my above-mentioned male friends did that, I can see myself maybe not mentioning it to my partner, not even in an attempt to deceive but just because I’d be so squicked out, and maybe suddenly questioning myself that I hadn’t realized that he felt that way, wondering if it WAS my fault, and just kind of trying to delete the whole experience from existing. There’s sometimes the feeling, for me, that once I talk about something to someone else, it makes it more real. And there have been disturbing things that have happened, on occasion, that I simply don’t repeat to anyone because I want it out of my brain. Its kind of a head-in-the-sand strategy and probably not a healthy one, but it isn’t based in deception.

I think if you own up to the entirety of what happened, allow your girlfriend to ask any questions and answer them fully and honestly without and hedging or evading, you should be fine. 

Don’t beat yourself up. I think some of the comments in the other threads were judgy and mean in the way that some redditors tend to be. And I think your situation is very much like the comparison I made above. We know now that it’s not cool to blame a woman when a man comes on to her with an unwanted advance, you are entitled to that same assurance of blamelessness."
relationships,fevownf,t1_fev0xps,1579399793.0,"For what it’s worth, I don’t agree with most of the opinions here regarding going back to her hotel room. If the two have you had an established platonic friendship and you, until then, had no reason to think she had feelings for you, I can see doing that after a work party in a hotel. 

Like, if it was a male work buddy, and the party is ending and they’ve given last call and the two of you were in the middle of a fun conversation, could you see going to one of your rooms for another drink? Or if the work function is really stiff and full of higher ups that you can’t relax around. I can see reasons why two friends would go to one of their rooms for a nightcap without expecting sex to enter into it.

I travel fairly often for work and am good friends with a number of my colleagues and this happens often enough. Granted, I’ve never specifically done this with a just a straight male colleague (I’m a straight woman, in a longterm, committed relationship) but I think that’s more because the situation hasn’t presented itself. I can think of a few (straight) guys who I’ve known for years, who are like buddies to me and I wouldn’t think anything of being alone in a hotel room with because ... well, the idea of either of us making a move is hilarious. 

SO, if my partner came to me with the exact story you have here, the only part that would trouble me a bit would be the fact that he hadn’t told me originally. The fact that you went to her room (and then rebuffed her advances and left when she made a move) doesn’t seem damning to me. It’s not like you guys were in the town you live and decided to get a hotel room together, she had a hotel room because she was staying in it. Going to visit your friend for a drink in their room is comparable to going to hang at their apartment for a drink.

I’d focus on the only real fuck up here, which, in my opinion, was lying about it in the first place. And, considering how freaked out something like this could make you, it’s not all that heinous. In a way, it reminds me of how women will often blame themselves, and be blamed, for being assaulted because they should’ve known better than to go to a guys apartment.

The statements I’m seeing here about how the only reason two adults would be alone together in a hotel room is to have sex with each other is just not my experience."

thatHappened,fe92x6g,t1_fe834w6,1578933637.0,"FWIW, it’s not the norm by any means but I’ve experienced it a number of times - it’s usually at the end of a particularly turbulent flight, or one with delays or something. And it’s more like a smattering than a big ovation. Like just a lighthearted “Yay! Finally!”

Come to think of it, though, I can’t recall it happening recently - maybe it was just a thing people did for a little while back in the 80s or something, and then the joke got old. Because it’s weird reading the comments here with some people saying “Yes, it definitely happens” and others saying “Nope, never happens”.

I’m 53 and have witnessed it a number of times so maybe it’s just age related?"

aww,fdof03b,t1_fdobvux,1578603866.0,"That looks like a golden doodle (even though it’s black, it’s still a golden doodle) - they are half standard poodle, half golden retriever and my understanding is that they are often hypoallergenic because poodles are. But apparently you can’t count on that some are - some aren’t. So if you want one, you should spend some time with the specific dog before committing to be sure.

I’ve known several of them and they are wonderful. Podles are the second smartest breed and golden retrievers are of course, unbelievably good natured (on the whole) so, speaking anecdotally, they are utterly delightful.

In the video there’s a bit of a creaking sound - is that just some sort of ambient noise or does Joe Joe make that sound?

And, if that’s not him making the sound, does he actually make any sounds?"
