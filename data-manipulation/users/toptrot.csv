Showerthoughts,ffy11zi,t1_ffy00v7,1580336438.0,"Exactly. For literally a century people have been making crap music that gets some radio play, makes a few bucks but makes no lasting impact on the culture or conversation and is immediately forgotten. 

The reason older pop music seems better is because it was the best of the slop produced in its time. For every hit there are 1000s of shit songs we’ll never hear. 

That’s my non-expert analysis at least."

Perhaps one day they’ll gather the courage to steal a pair. And the students will band together to replace them. 

And the cycle continues."
