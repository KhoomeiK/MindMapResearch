you are conflating two things many americans do. *impeachment* is not the same as *removal*. impeachment means that the house of representatives believes that there is sufficient evidence to remove a federal official for cause.  quite literally any federal official could be impeached for wearing a white shirt and black shoes using those two facts as cause if the house feels like impeaching someone."

politics,ffecfzg,t1_ffdajqg,1579843027.0,"not really. we're in a perilous time period where whether or not the gop remains dominant as a decided minority is going to be determined. 

there is in charge of the executive branch people who not only believe that our previous election was not interfered with by outside sources despite literally every intelligence agency saying so. the same executive branch also believes that our elections won't be interfered with again. the same executive branch is in charge of running the census which determines congressional representation and attempted to put on the census a question almost guaranteed to underreport the count. 

there is in a majority of the states republican run legislature that will draw district lines using that census data to make seats safer for republicans and even increase republican seats because the supreme court of the united states has decided this kind of thing is a political issue than a legal one. also in these states there are increased restrictive laws on voting keeping people from voting which were put in place when the same supreme court struck down key portions of the voting rights act.

we have a supreme court that rules nearly everything 5-4, and the reason why it's not 6-3 is b we are all reliant on an 85+ year old multiple time cancer survivor to survive until january 3, 2021 when the next congress convenes subject to democrats winning the senate and white house.  things not certain because of outside interference not prevented by a republican executive that benefitted from that interference, republican lege states who have artificially placed unnecessary obstacles  in front of the voting booth, and have drawn district lines in 2012 designed to get republicans elected.

politics,ffc38k0,t1_ffbmitb,1579790438.0,"no. term limits only cause a lot more turnover of people who don't know how the legislative bodies work, thus exponentially increasing the power and influence of rich donors, rich lobbyists, and rich corporations.  you would essentially let more different mouthpieces of the elites get recycled every few years.  and if an actual person who cares about doing good government gets elected or even a majority of those kinds of people, all a powerful backer would have to do is wait since they would only have so many years to work with. 

 one democratic candidate proposed a 12 year term limit. know who that would directly effect? adam schiff, who has 11 years in the house already. term limits would keep adam schiff out of the next congress and I would say that he's been one of if not the most effective member of congress this session. another would be elijah cummings, he would have been gone years ago.  same for john lewis. bernie sanders would have been banished more than 10 years ago. 

if you want to fix politics, step one is to get the big money and hidden money donators out of politics, publicly fund all federal campaigns so there's an opportunity for anyone to run without needing to fundraise for tons of money before even declaring a candidacy, and allowing candidates to raise funds after getting in only. plus regulate facebook so that these deliberately false ads can't be propagated.

step two is to have those people who can vote but don't, who think both parties are the same and don't hold their elected officials accountable actually go vote.  voting is it's own term limit. get enough people to vote and bad people go away. bad people probably won't even run since a lot more people will be there to catch the bad candidates.  an excellent election day is when 45% of people vote. that is a pathetic number. that's the reason why the bad people in government do bad things; they know that less than a third of people are paying attention and will go vote back home. if you have 90% of your constituents voting in every election who are you going to be more responsive to, the people who vote or the people who make substantial campaign contributions?

unregulated capitalism is operating as it should.

the folks back home are utterly convinced that ""low skilled"" jobs deserve low pay and are filled by teenagers and at the same time actually believe that them working 3 jobs to barely make ends meet is a temporary situation only.

and on that low skilled point, they think that flipping burgers is an easy job.  that particular skillset isn't that hard if you pay attention. thing is, that's not the only skill that job entails. you have to be able to make a sandwich correctly quickly consistently and during peak periods sometimes with 4 or 5 items on an order on multiple orders. the people who bitch the loudest that fast food is easy either haven't done it or haven't done it in decades and i'm convinced that none of them could hang in the kitchens for 30 minutes.

worldnews,ff3a88b,t3_er8zfm,1579537263.0,"for capitalism to work, it requires an entity to buy stuff which isn't the problem. totally unregulated capitalism means that the entities producing stuff can also be bought which can lead to consolidation and monopolies forming which leads to higher prices due to less market pressures. it also means that the main concern is to make as much money as possible. one of the leading sunk costs is labor, so you pay your labor as little as possible. with no rules in play capitalism will lead to gigantic and larger companies owning a particular market charging high prices (cause they can) to a marketplace that doesn't have a lot of money since wages are low. unless you are insanely rich which is not the case for just about every single one of us that kind of arrangement will not work.

i think that the reason capitalism is losing favor in the united states is because it is no longer sufficiently regulated since regulations directly cost corporations profits.  simultaneously I think that socialism is looked on more favorably is because capitalism (the way its been run in the united states the past 40 years) has failed the middle class but the people in charge refuse to make the changes to make it work better and the rest of the population sees how the more socialistic countries have higher standards of living."

the afr family led by businessman tamer afr was interested in upper level minor league hockey and the american hockey league (think aaa hockey to the nhl) granted them a franchise.  the afrs put it in louisville to play games in freedom hall. this move displaced the frogs from town, so no more romps in the swamp (broadbentarena). that was mistake 1. games in 16000 seat freedom hall versus, I don't know 3-4000 in broadbent without gaging if there was that much interest.  freedom hall didn't sell out (even though the panthers made the playoffs in the first year) and rent to play there was very high. put a pin in that.

while the team was here the afrs bought iceland (renamed it pantherland) and used it as the practice facility. and apparently didn't keep up with their financial and sponsorship agreements. like they expected to have a business buy a sponsorship but not do much for the sponsors in return. and then go demand higher sponsorship rates year 2.  that was mistake 2.  they didn't do much for iceland either and had financial issues with that too.

as for year two, go ahead and take out that pin. for an 82 game schedule and 41 home games, quite a few (say more than 5 less than 15) were not played anywhere close to the commonwealth of kentucky.  and there was another ahl team playing games in rupp arena at the same time period. some games were played in grand rapids where the afrs were from and had a facility. some were played on the opponents home ice with the panthers designated as the home team. and you could barely pick up the games in town.  year 1 games were on 970 with a nice clear signal. year 2 games were on 680 which half the county could just barely pick up if they didn't get bounced by any nascar races.  not just winston cup races, busch and craftsman truck races also took priority.  there was no other radio outlet if there was a conflict and no tape delay aired. no games were ever on tv. basically the team management coasted not on their year 1 success but their initial announcement of a team for their only two years and got lucky year 1.  

oh, and tamer afr managed to con~~vince~~ arena football 2 (minor league to the arena football league) to award him a franchise there with the louisville fire.

by the middle of the off-season of year 2 it was clear that he wasn't paying his bills locally or to the ahl. the team announced it was suspending operations, the team moved to san antonio as the rampage, afr was relieved of his franchise which laid dormant for a few years before being moved and revived in Iowa.  he managed to hold on to the fire for a few years before being forced to sell them off.  I might be conflating some memories but I think that afr was later sued for nonpayments or he got charged with fraud.

the afrs dealings with the business community I really believe soured them on hockey, and the echl was not likely to come back after afr killed any foothold had by essentially not promoting the louisville hockey team in louisville. which really was a shame since ROBERTO FREAKING LUONGO played here for like a season and a half.  it almost killed the fire too. they probably survived longer because of local ownership being involved in the local business community.

so yeah. why isn't there hockey in louisville? tamer fucking afr.

this statement works equally as sarcasm and the honest truth.

i work in fast food management. my company trades on a major stock exchange. I've been with them for nearly 16 years. I've been averaging over the last couple of years at least 2.5 hours of overtime a week and I get paid less than $15 with only 2 weeks paid vacation, no sick days or personal days. yet (as of right now last I saw) one share of stock for my company trades for 3 digits.  

you can't tell me that people who work that long for a company that is doing that well, especially in some sort of management capacity, don't deserve more than that.  apparently treating your workforce like shit pays off if fear of losing a paycheck may mean a decision between eating, medicine, or rent, and your workforce doesn't have many other viable options available.  they're very productive because they're scared of losing their job to someone else possibly better, faster, and cheaper with open availability. that's also partially why you will not see a massive protest or general strike for more than a few hours from labor across all industries. 

the other part is that for some odd and perverse reason the american people overall believe that some work deserves far less pay for just as stressful (physically and mentally) work than others and that the reward for the people who work the longest for those stressful jobs daily is the satisfaction of a job well done ~~baku~~. that kind of protestant work ethic belief never made any logical sense to me. especially if working really hard in some jobs like mine or any other service retail job rarely pays off and doesn't pay well in this time of high prices for daily necessaries.

all workers in the richest and most productive country on the planet (including middle managers) at minimum should be guaranteed 4 weeks of paid leave with paid sick days and paid personal days on livable wages. but there are so many social issues in this country that making sure people can go see a doctor and not be charged half of a paycheck is seen as socialism. I'm not sure if the political pressure can be applied to just at least make the system balanced instead of skewed so heavily towards business like it is now."

if a corporation could get rid of its largest reason for spending money (which typically is labor) and still make massive profits they would. but since owning people as property so you don't have to pay them is illegal in this country, paying them serf wages is the next best thing"

Kentucky,fecrshf,t3_eo33ap,1578982168.0,"in a state where it's already hard to vote and on the regular less than 40% do, we need ***MORE*** laws restricting voting.  because as we all know voter fraud is wild and rampant throughout the commonwealth. 

healthcare? increasing revenues?  education? transitioning to a non fossil fuel economy? completely unimportant. we need to prioritize laws to prevent felony voter fraud (which statistically doesn't exist) and preventing cities from becoming sanctuary cities (which there aren't any).

ladies and gentlemen, this is your republican state general assembly doing the work to improve the outlooks of all of the citizens of the great commonwealth of kentucky. I want to point out that if voter fraud were that big of an issue the general assembly would have brought it up at least during the time that dubya was in office. but there was a democratic secretary of state then. the fact there's now a republican SoS I'm sure is a total coincidence."

politics,fe2nc6h,t1_fe03e1l,1578840882.0,"I've been going to professional sports since 2002, 5 champcar races from 2002-07, major league baseball games since 2008.  and I hated the pregame ceremonies. it all seemed forced, even before I actually started going to games.  I pegged the hypernationalism-cloaked-as-patriotism pretty early, say a few months after 2001 when I strangely realized there were a bunch of american flags hanging on the front porches in the neighborhood, and every other neighborhood on the way to school. then suddenly every game broadcast also made sure to show the playing of the national anthem as well. I admit getting caught up in it a little since that was my senior year of high school and this was the world being given to me. so just like every other dutiful american I stood and took off my hat for the anthem and pledge like a good little drone because I didn't know better.

i kept thinking that all of this symbolism and military worship was over the top but just went along with it until around 2006.  I read a story about a little town out west that had a dirt track and a yearly tradition of an annual school bus race. I thought it was kinda quaint until I also read in the same story how the attendees at this race are very patriotic. so patriotic that they physically accost anyone (actually any man because women don't have to take off their hats at any time for any reason or occasion) who does not take off their hat for the anthem. that got me to change my thinking. if someone doesn't want to take off their hat for a meaningless ceremony saying ""yay, go us!"" at an unimportant sporting event why can't they? and if they don't what business is it of yours to make sure they comply with unwritten unofficial requests? it's their freedom and liberty, which is what the military fights to protect.

it had also come to light that the department of defense paid teams in the big 4 major sports and to the leagues themselves to honor selected veterans or active duty service members attending the game. the DoD also spent money sponsoring racing teams as the primary sponsor or secondary sponsor given the primary feature during big holiday weekend events especially memorial day and independence day. 

that was my straw that broke the camel's back. I was disgusted. that's not patriotism. that's using fear and a never question authority attitude to browbeat and harass people who might question what our government is telling our military to do in our name across the globe into compliance. because what patriotic american is going to say they don't support the troops?  and what patriotic american won't rise to their feet, place their hands or hats over their hearts with the presentation of colors and the playing of the anthem? and what patriotic business wouldn't give vets and active duty military discounts to thank them for their service?  they had that kind of attitude in germany in the 1930s and 40s too, and look at what also happened there. 

since then I've kept my hat on. I'm expressing my first amendment right to free speech; the anthem and flag presentation pregame is stupid, and glorifying war (which is what the star spangled banner and flag presentation does) before every single public gathering where athletic competition takes place sends a bad message, and soldiers shouldn't be singled out for honors for doing their jobs because their job is tough.  you know what is also a tough job? garbage collector.  teacher.  trauma nurse.  public service worker.  over the road trucker.  farmer. air traffic controller.  anonymous workers just doing their jobs and keeping the country running, except they don't have flag patches on their sleeves. 

and as an aside, I work in the food service industry as a manager. I have to deal with a bunch of crazy karens on a regular basis while running a shift with a group of teenagers who are more interested in their phones than work and getting customers their food in a quick time period. especially during rush periods. not many people can do that either just like some people could never join the services. so when will people come to me if say ""I could never do what you do, thanks for your service""? (rhetorical question, I'm not or ever would pander for recognition for doing my job.)"

Kentucky,fdqshux,t1_fdqp1rq,1578673926.0,"what's the unspoken reason nationwide for voter id? that's what republicans are banking on for their reasoning behind the bill.  and the reason it sells with the folks back home is the same reason why cutting the social safety net programs sell back at home, the voters think that it's going to hurt black and brown people who typically vote for democrats. in reality it's going to proportionally affect republican base voters more but because they're all spread out in low population areas you won't hear any stories about it unlike in city dwelling high population areas.

I'm saying it's a bad bill and that poor people are going to be affected regardless of preferred party. that's a bad thing in a state that doesn't really vote now as it is or cares that much about voting.  if it is as serious an issue as being portrayed, then it would have been proposed back when dubya was pushing the issue. but we had a democratic secretary of state back then. I'm quite sure that because there's a republican secretary of state now who is totes okay with this bill (and nationwide republican socs have also been okay with putting not enough voting machines in high population areas, non functioning machines in those same areas, approving paperless voting machines, and kicking as many people off the rolls as possible.  also totally a coincidence I'm sure). 

and by the way, you're talking about intentional voter fraud, the stuff that gets prosecuted in court. that's not what this is designed to prevent and a total seperate thing. and even talking about intentional voter fraud statistically that doesn't happen either. voter fraud is not an issue we need to be worried about. election fraud is."

they have obviously written this to prevent democratic leaning voters from voting. I'll bet you that per usual this is a bill targeted towards one group that disproportionally affects the other. how many white and poor people out in the commonwealth are going to be negatively affected by this modern day poll tax?

I'm calling this a poll tax because yes the proposed bill calls for providing a free id for voting purposes. but what about renewal time?  is that going to be free as well?
