I do think that Rage is definitely a special case though. Their political messaging is pretty much their signature thing. I could easily excuse people for not listening to lyrics in songs, even from their favorite bands... but Rage? It must take some serious effort to tune out ALL the lyrics, especially when so much of the energy in their music *comes from the lyrics*.

AdviceAnimals,ff79ya0,t3_erj1d1,1579644203.0,"Be sure to drive your car farther than that once a week or so. If you don't let your car heat up fully before you shut it off, condensation can build up in the crankcase and mix with your oil. Normally, your engine will heat up and any water in your oil would evaporate once above 100C. If the engine never gets that opportunity, water may build up and that isn't good for a number of reasons.

If your drive is short enough that your heater won't heat, you're thermostat isn't opening because the engine isn't up to temperature."
Showerthoughts,ff73jds,t1_ff6vtzu,1579640404.0,"Similar thing happened to my old Galaxy S4. The charging port is on a separate circuit board so it was easily fixable. I was able to swap out the board with one I ordered from China.

Took a few weeks to get the part and I had no wireless charging... so I spliced up the charger I had and sandwiched the wires right between the phone and battery terminals. If the cord was plugged in, it would charge. When it wasn't, it was still attached but coiled up in my pocket.

I had to be careful though, bypassing the charging board means it wouldn't shut off power when the battery was full... so I had to babysit my phone while charging it.

Got the new part and swapped out out with a couple small tools and was back to 100%! Used that phone for like 2 more years afterwards."

Diets are not a ""do this for a while until you're skinny"" thing. If a diet is being sold/marketed as such, it's most certainly bullshit and is trying to take your money.

If you ""go on a diet"" you are doing it wrong. The correct way is to change your diet (for life) to something healthier. If you stop after a while you're just relapsing.

It's why good drug rehab centers focus on lifestyle changes that help the former user to not revert to the behavior that got them addicted in the first place. If they measure success simply by someone being sober for a moment, they are missing a huge part of the problem.

If you measure your weight right now and it's healthy because you've been on a diet for a while... Why would you give up? You had better not do so and expect to stay healthy, that's just moronic.

I was raised in pretty redneck part of NY and if it weren't for education and higher learning, I'd have likely just fell into the same pit of racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and general ignorance and stupidity that many of my classmates did. I actually hung out a lot with these folks because of my brother and some mutual friends. The camaraderie they build is real and it feels good to be ""among brothers"" (and they are fucking awesome to drink with), but when the shit that comes out of their mouths is morally disgusting, you gotta choose between that camaraderie, or all the signs in your head that point to ""these people have got some shit wrong up there that's just too inexcusable to overlook"".

Then I got out, moved to VT, and met people that are actually good folks. I realized what I had gotten away from and knew I could never go back. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find that same sense of camaraderie elsewhere, but I'm okay with that. Others might just need that though, more than they need ""facts"" or ""knowledge"". It was really telling when my redneck high school buddies seemed to be proud to be uneducated. That just really did not compute for me at the time, but I realize now that it was the tribalism that was mostly responsible.

If we could break down the tribalism, a good number of folks would see how fucked up their behavior is. Not all, not even most, but *some* would do what I did. Without everyone around you being racist (just one example), you might actually realize that you, yourself, have no actual qualms with anyone of another race... and that maybe those racist thoughts in your head are simply just other's thoughts playing back on repeat and aren't yours at all... but you have been letting them play back for years... burning into your brain... without really even *listening* to them, because others you trust say the same thing and it just gets accepted as fact. Only after you're removed from those negative influences do you start to see *yourself*... who *you* are and how *you* feel based on *your* experiences. Some folks will probably still be flat-out racist, some would probably feel conflicted, but stick to their guns because change is scary, but there would be some (and I'd bet money on it) who would break away, given this chance.

I guess that's just how most extreme groups operate though. A sense of camaraderie and tribalism. It's incredibly effective at keeping folks in the group, but it's not great at converting others who are already outside of it. This basically just explains the whole reason the GOP is against having good education though. Indoctrinate them while young and ignorant because it's hard to indoctrinate a well-educated adult.
