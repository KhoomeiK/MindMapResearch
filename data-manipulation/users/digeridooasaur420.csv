It is easy to forget this since they often cast 23+ year old models to play teens but think of the teenagers you know and imagine them in that predicament, if it were 14 year old me in that situation I would probably just start crying. On top of all that have you guys ever tried running in the woods at night without tripping? It's harder than it sounds even during a full moon."

nfl,fdr659o,t1_fdqe4xg,1578680032.0,That's actually one of my favorite games. I liked the intensity on both sides and you can tell they weren't pulling punches. You kind of knew going into that games how much they hated each other that season.

nfl,fdr3ro7,t1_fdqqpww,1578679128.0,"This might sound weird but I kind of wish there were more touchdowns. It was cool to see a shootout but I kept getting blue balls whenever New England would get in the redzone. New England was obviously very good that year but I can't help but feel as though that team and offense really missed Edelman, like Tom would have 40 touchdowns and 5 picks that season and won that super bowl. 


I think it showed in the regular season some but really showed during that super bowl because iirc they would keep getting into short yardage situations but not be able to convert so they would go for the field goal."
