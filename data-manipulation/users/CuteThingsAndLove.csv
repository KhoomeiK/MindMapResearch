NSFWFunny,ffnu3ma,t1_ffnecvo,1580070842.0,"No it doesn't. Women shouldn't be expected to be hairless because nobody ever complains about men with pubes. People have this fetish over women who look prepubescent and to expecting us to be clean shaven is annoying.

This guy is complaining about this girl because she's annoying and supposedly brought back the popularity of the bush, and I'm saying that women have stopped shaving down there because we've realized that the expectation to look like a child who hasn't grown pubic hair yet is stupid. Waxing hurts and shaving leaves razor bumps. We don't like it. Some women prefer it for their own reasons, fine, but it's wrong for them to feel pressured into having no hair when it's natural."
NSFWFunny,ffntbhn,t1_ffn3dl7,1580070523.0,I don't care about women who prefer to shave. I care about men who find bushes gross because women aren't hairless. It's stupid and gross to be turned off by a grown woman with a bush.

relationship_advice,ffka33q,t3_eu05o8,1580019425.0,"Remember that your mother had a choice to keep you, give you away, or abort you. She chose to keep you, and raise you, and love you. You may be the result of the worst day of her life, but clearly she does not regret having you.

How do you live with this new knowledge? That's up to you. You can pretend he never reached out to you and never speak of him again. I don't recommend answering his message or *ever* meeting him in person (even on his death bed).

What I do recommend is that you take this moment to cherish your parents and your sister... but really, especially your mom. Show her more appreciation (not pity) and love. Make sure you tell her you love her after every phone call or every time you leave the house.

Your DNA doesn't define who you are. The people who raised you, the environment you grew up in, that stuff helps shape you, but even that *does not define you*.

The only thing that defines who you are is you. You choose to be defined by whatever you feel. You can choose to be the rapist's daughter. Or, you can choose to be your mother's daughter, your father's daughter. Yourself. It's not *his* decision to take away from you. Just like your mother did not allow him to define who she is.

I recommend seeing a therapist to help you sort your feelings out. But you know, deep down, that your existence is not wrong, you didn't do anything wrong. You are truly loved by the people who matter. And you need to realize that you *do* know that already. You just need to find that within yourself again.

Good luck hon, I really hope you get through this. My DM is open if you ever want to talk, vent, etc."

AskReddit,ffhfuiz,t3_etcyd6,1579933470.0,"From what I remember reading somewhere, there was a theory that the reason suicide rates are so high for men compared to women, is because men typically use more immediate methods of killing themselves, which can usually be more painful, or destroy how they look. Women typically avoid these methods and go for things like drugs to overdose on, which is usually easier to recover from than, say, a gunshot wound to the head.

So my first idea is one that would likely be turned down by a lot of people, but I'd say stricter gun control would possibly lower suicide rates. If people can't get access to guns to immediately end it in one shot, they would have to try to turn to other, less ""appealing"" methods. Turning to other options, they might find themselves too scared to go through with it, or even be able to be saved.

I also imagine that a lot of suicides happen when people are in a state of mind where things feel slightly unreal. I say this as someone who typically dissociates on a daily basis, where things feel very dreamlike and my actions seem like they have no consequences. I imagine that in at least *some* cases, people don't really feel the weight of their actions when they are committing suicide. So someone using a gun really has to decide in one quick moment to pull the trigger (although I'm sure it would take most people *hours* to really come to that conclusion). Whereas a drug overdose, or staring at how far down the jump is from a bridge, when you're already halfway through with your choice of suicide method, there's still the option to back out to safety.

Speaking of bridges, I watched a k-drama where the main character went to a bridge while she was grieving, and there was a phone there that she picked up and was immediately sent to a 24 hour hotline for suicide prevention. I think if more bridges had these types of phones installed, maybe more people will seek help when the option is right there in front of them.

Emotionally speaking, society really needs to get a grip on the sexist attitude it currently maintains. When women have problems, we are seen as ""emotional"" which, first of all, implies that only women feel emotions, and takes away from the idea that men also share these complex feelings, and second of all, implies that having emotions is a negative quality. If a man or a young boy cries, we sometimes hear the phrase ""man up"". This pushes the idea that men do not feel emotions. And that being a woman is a bad thing. And that having emotions is a bad thing.

Sexism is a problem that affects us all. Women are usually the ones who are talking about it, so the term is usually understood to mean ""issues against women"" but the problem is that, any stereotypes placed on women immediately place the opposite stereotypes on men as well.

Sorry, I went on a rant."

You need someone to guide you with your feelings and how to share your feelings with them. A professional is better suited for this than Reddit is."
