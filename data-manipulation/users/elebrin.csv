Self esteem is a phrase kids hear pretty early from adults, and when I was first playing with the idea, steampunk was getting some attention and phone selfies were first becoming popular.

facepalm,ffk2zim,t1_ffjz1q9,1580014218.0,"> Obese people aren’t always overeating either

Maybe not all of the time, but they are overeating. Overeating is the only way to become obese. Anyone who tells you different is simply incorrect.

>in no way shape or form a research based approach

I don't feel that I need a ""researched based approach."" I know exactly what a doctor would say to them, because I know what my doctor said to me, what my mother's doctor said to her, what my father's doctor said to him, what my sister's doctor said to her, and so on.

>Being kind and compassionate with tangible options is a more effective approach

Kindness is looking out for one another. Both I and my girlfriend have family members who are slowly killing themselves with food.

>Also assuming somebody hasn’t gone through some traumatic event, has an underlying disease, has been this way their whole life

I actually assume all of those things are probably true in the case of someone who is obese. If you are soothing your emotions with eating, or eating because you are stressed or bored or in pain or as a distraction or whatever, then you need to see a psychologist and get your issue dealt with. And I have told people they need to do that. Politely. I wish more people in their lives would say that whenever they are overeating instead of enabling them.

As a general rule, I don't give food as gifts to overweight or obese people. When I cook for and serve them, I serve a them the same carefully calorie-counted plate that I serve myself and everyone else. If we go out to eat, I don't let them pick the buffet or somewhere where they can gorge themselves. If they ask my advice on what to get, I suggest something I know they like that has a reasonable calorie count (if I know them well enough. Otherwise, I'll just suggest something that I like that has a reasonable calorie count). I'm not in-your-face about it, and I'm not a dick about it, but if someone calls me out I am honest. If they are obese, I will tell them that they are obese and that they need to eat less.

It is lying for me to tell someone that it's OK because I simply do not believe that it is OK. I know what the endgame of obesity looks like.

A guitar doesn't really have a single ""natural"" note. It has six. You can think of the natural chord that they create a few ways, but it can be interpreted as a sort of E minor or maybe a G with the sixth and ninth thrown in. I think that's sort of it's natural, all ""open"" sound. 

As noted elsewhere, it is considered a C instrument because all the open strings are unflatted and unsharped and therefore fit in the key of C. I would argue that the key of G major is the easiest key to play in because the three main chords in that key have simple open chords (G, C, and D) while C tosses in an F chord which is a bit more work to play (and is often the bane of many young guitar students). Indeed, G, D, E, A, and C are the most common keys I have seen songs written in for guitar unless an alternate tuning is used."

I'd be more concerned about water, because it has a bad habit of not drying completely for days/weeks after cleaning and unless you are getting deionized water and testing the pH of it, the chances you will get a residue or some corrosion are worse just because it lingers.

getdisciplined,ffcm3y8,t1_ffcik95,1579802362.0,"Well, there is a difference between ""needing it"" in a healthy way and ""needing it"" in an unhealthy way.

At their best, relationships do a few things. First, they motivate you to get and stay disciplined, because you have responsibilities you want to fulfill that require strong discipline. Second, they give you help with those things so you aren't entirely on your own. Third, they provide positive and negative feedback on a sliding scale and directly reward you on how well you are doing.

>It's also way less pressure on a relationship if you're not having the thought of ""needing it"" in the back of your head.

I'm not convinced that's a good thing. If we need our relationships, that's just a sign that we are invested in their success. If we don't need them, then the second something better comes along, it's over and that's not a good thing. There are, of course, healthy ways and unhealthy ways about that too.

We don't need to try to be ultra disciplined in a vacuum. If we have reasons for what we do and we evaluate them and work towards them, then we will fare far better than if we do something ""because someone told me once that I should."" Those reasons often end up being other people. And, if that makes my life better, and it makes their lives better, why is that a bad thing?"

getdisciplined,ffcbhtf,t1_ffc5ish,1579795857.0,"Right, but MY point is that it's far more difficult to do all of those things without help. Additionally, these things feed into each other: going to the doctor means you are getting advice about your diet and exercise. Going to a dentist means you are getting advice about brushing and flossing. Trying to manage your diet and exercise may drive you to talk to a doctor and start getting regular checkups, and brushing and flossing may bring to light dental issues that you want to talk to a dentist about. 

Having a relationship is the same way. You can't have a person over to your place if it's a mess, and you can't even attract someone to come to your place unless you are taking care of yourself and your environment physically and economically.

Taking the relationship out of it removes a cog that is important to a very large number of people. You've broken the positive feedback loop that makes managing everything easier.

Wanting to find and have love in your life is a good, wholesome motivation. You aren't entitled to it, of course, so it seems like an impossible goal to many (including myself for the longest time). 

>Have a look at the list above, imagine someone achieving all of it except marriage - would you say that person doesn't have their life together?

No, but that situation isn't long term sustainable. I spent my late 20s trying to take care of all of those things all by myself with little to no help and it's very difficult. One lax day was enough to set me back and ruin my ability to get everything done for weeks after, and essentially all of my non-working time was spent on chores. Two or three days of being sick and unable to work or handle my personal business, and I was underwater. A good relationship gives you help with that burden, and you can share some of the load. Shared living space means only one person has to clean. Shared bills means only one person needs to manage them. Fully integrated finances... well, we aren't doing that, so I can't speak to it. Getting married would be fantastic, because then only one of us needs to handle insurance stuff. We are looking at going down to one car between us, because I work from home and can rent when I travel. Shared resources take a LOT of the workload of being disciplined off, and it also gives that feedback that keeps you on the right track.

I think there are other ways to go, too, that can provide that feedback loop. Communal living with family or a social organization (Fraternity), being in the military and living in a shared dormitory,  and working for a factory that has a shared dormitory are some of the examples I can think of off the top of my head but there are likely others too. It's a safety net, and an external factor that keeps you on track in your own life and gives you a REASON to stay on track in your own life.

Part of good discipline is putting yourself into situations where you can do the right thing easily. Do you make bad food choices at buffets? Don't freakin' go to buffets! Or, if you do, just get a drink and have some food later but don't eat there. That's what I had to do for a long time before I figured out how to manage my nearly uncontrollable appetite."

MensRights,ffbxpiw,t3_esoreh,1579786127.0,"You have a few choices for how to go through life:

You can stay naive and just trust everyone outright. Probably not a good choice, but most of the time this is reserved for kids. Often it's what we like about kids.

You can become pessimistic, nihilistic, jaded, or cynical. Sometimes this happens after you've gotten burned for being naive, sometimes it comes because you have seen other people get burned, and sometimes people just choose this for some reason because they've found a reason to grow hateful. A lot of these women are here. It's a stage in the maturation process that a lot of people never move past. We live in a world these days where you can get away with it - you don't HAVE to interact with people or severely limit the people you interact with if you choose to after a certain point so it's very easy to just stay here for a very long time. There are consequences though. You can't develop an intimate relationship here. You can't build a family here unless you are an absolute tyrant and find someone willing to be with a tyrant. You can't make new friends, and it's likely you will lose the friends you have over time as you become more and more stuck inside your own head from the self-imposed isolation. I don't have anything to back it up, but I feel like this is the same thing that really drives and feeds into sexism, racism, and any of the other exclusionary sorts of behaviors.

Finally, you can understand that some people are shitty, learn to mitigate some of the risks, and ultimately start trusting people again. Maybe not all of the time, maybe not everyone, but most people, most of the time. You hand them a little rope, then see if they hang themselves (or try to hang you) with it and you figure it out by trial and error when you need to trust people further. Someone might and probably will try to hurt you again, but you can learn to identify it by watching their behaviors, learning their motivations, and figuring out what they are trying to do.

That second category is a terrible place to be for any extended time. It's a place of anxiety and hatred, and that's exactly where these women live.

Instead of actively trying to make a better experience for themselves, they reject everyone and everything, isolate themselves to tiny little cloistered communities, and that's that for them.
