 - ""you having a good night?"": framing the positive instead of the gut-reaction to confront a possible threat after they failed initial compliance. 

 -  avoided excessive eye contact: eye-contact is wired to the reptilian brain, intense eye contact usually triggers emotional reactions escalating the situation (eye contact from a predator in the jungle means you're about to get eaten).

 - organic pauses giving him the mental space instead of pressing him for an immediate action: pushing crazy against the wall usually leads to escalation so ""give them the illusion of control"".

 -  kept playing with your toy to put him at ease preventing escalation while controlling the frame,  but the side glances demonstrate you kept  situational awareness.  

 - usage of [""motherese""](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/10/12/uncovering-sound-motherese-baby-talk-across-languages) to sooth the beast instead of a loud aggressive tone of voice.
