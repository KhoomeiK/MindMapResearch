witcher,ff977tb,t1_ff96ffi,1579706461.0,"I agree with this being not the best way to get your hands on needed resources and this is disgusting behaviour. 

However the part with the WHITE supremacy and the “I fucking hate Americans” was the racist part. 
Because if we go into the more fact based part, he was born in South-Africa and his mom is Canadian, while his father is south-african. 
Just because he studied in America and grew up there, doesn’t mean that ALL Americans should be hated. 

What he did was disgusting indeed however."

KingdomHearts,fcng80g,t1_fcneo6h,1577811066.0,"Yes. Not fond of it in the slightest. 
They did it once in Final Mix. Why not be smart and add this shit in the first version of KH3? Because money. 
Not saying other developers aren’t doing the same. But at least they don’t explain the story with an extra paid DLC. Again as an example: FF15 the episodes. 

If you need a DLC to explain plot points in your story and they need to be paid for, those games can fuck right off."
KingdomHearts,fcnd5ji,t3_ei0rqx,1577809176.0,"Not getting the DLC for fucking 30€.
