gtaonline,ff32znc,t3_erd6x3,1579532344.0,"What I don't get is how the Hunter and (the stealth chopper, its name eludes me at the moment) are so fucking dumb to fly! They wobble and are so unstable, they're a joke.

Now, I know some people are just gonna reply 'get good' but that's my point, I am a skilled pilot in the game and have a tough time flying and attacking with those two, whereas anyone can get on an Opressor and feel as thought they're actually skilled.

Vehicles in this game should have been level related, not money related, any lvl 5 can get an Opressor nowadays and grief the shit out of actual players, I rarely see a lvl 100+ griefing on an Opressor."

I think he did it himself for internet recognition. I know of no one that would take their hard hat home, that's what lockers in work are for and at the end of the job, leave it there."

You could always do Titan of a Job, Blow-Up, Diamonds are for Trevor, etc on a playlist.
Or try a dedicated X-Box Reddit. Shame this game isn't cross platform. Good luck, Dude."

IsItBullshit,fdltzac,t1_fdkky2x,1578532444.0,"Okay, someone mentioned sampling, so I'll hit on that briefly, you understand the basic concept, person writes song, person records song, person releases song and whoever's name is on the writing credits will be getting paid EVERY TIME that song is played somewhere in the world, if you write a big and popular enough hit, it will keep getting played for years (Slade- Merry Christmas springs to mind here) that particular song only gets played one month per year, yet it nets the songwriters roughly half a million pounds in that time.

Now, the 'sample' has already been explained, just hitting on that, if you have a 'sample' from someone else's published record on your song, then they'll take part writing credits and part royalties, rightly so, they originally wrote it and it's enhancing your song too, so then some clever dick decided to sample THEIR OWN previous records on their new songs, you can see where this is headed.

Now, we've covered actual 'songwriting' the thing about rappers is that most of them can just, well...rap! They can't write or make music, they may have a 'beat' they rap over, so they go to a label and the label assigns them a 'producer' so the rapper and producer get together in a studio, the producer lays rhythm, beats, samples, etc and by them doing that, gives them a, you've guessed it, writing credit!

Oh boy! Don't get me started on producers and 'executive' producers!

I'll leave it there for now, before the internet runs out of ink!"
IsItBullshit,fdjouxn,t3_elif05,1578481406.0,"To get paid in the music industry, it's not about rapping, singing, performing, it's ALL about the writing credits, it gives the all important ROYALTIES.

Vanilla Ice is a prime example here, he had a worldwide number one hit and Ice Ice Baby made a hell of a lot of money literally overnight and thrust him into the spotlight, he was in huge demand so TV shows that wanted to book him, they pay a fee of around, say, 5000 dollars, He turns up, does a quick interview and performs his 'new song' and leaves, he could fit 3, maybe 4 'Personal Appearances' in a day, leaving him with say, 15-20,000 dollars, he's happy, the audience are happy, the TV show is happy, his record label are happy and more importantly, everyone is getting paid!

However, there are people here who are NOT getting paid and they are the songwriters of the original track (Under Pressure- David Bowie and Queen) so, they, quite rightly, take Vanilla Ice's record label to court, win the case and get ALL the royalties, both past and future from Vanilla's record.

I could go on about this all day, but phone formatting keeps it shorter (lucky you)

Hope you get the gist."
