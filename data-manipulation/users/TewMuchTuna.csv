Yes, which is what it would do to a person as well. Because it's a scared animal. Again, if it wanted to, it could hang on until it was dead.

Literally this whole thread was that a cat could thrash it's way out of an owl's clutches, and then maul it. When in reality the only reason the owl would ever let go would be if it were scared or tired."

Not being able to visually see where your fingers are on the neck or how wide the frets are has got to be extremely challenging if you've never held a guitar before, which is where everyone starts. But once you've got the feel down, which is not an easy task, I can see there being an advantage to there just being you and the guitar. Also wouldn't be surprised if the vibrations you feel in the guitar itself are that much more heightened to where you can physically feel the tones you are producing. If you blindfolded and plugged the ears of an experienced guitar player they could still tune it with nothing but feel because you can feel when the tones match up in your hand holding the neck.
