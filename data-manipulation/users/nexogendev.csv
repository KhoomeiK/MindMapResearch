macsetups,fflkv9m,t3_espiq8,1580040823.0,Well that was interesting music I just listened to that link you sent me.
macsetups,fflk077,t1_fflj1je,1580040543.0,"Reason is an excellent DAW. I also used Reason for years.  You can’t go wrong with Propellerhead Reason. May I also suggest Studio One 4 Professional. You can actually rent-to-own on Splice for $16 a month as well. It has a plugin called “Chorder” which allows you to play in key for faster composing or for those who are still learning. It’s one of the best DAWs I’ve used. Even though I am a major Logic Pro X user, I couldn’t resist Studio One 4 with the sampling and remix workflow they have as well."
macsetups,fflihqe,t1_ffl00ht,1580040005.0,"When I first started, I was 15. I knew how to play the keys but I wasn’t Beethoven by any means. I can say that today you do not need to know a lick of music theory to get started and with the right DAW (Digital audio workstation/music production software) Like FL Studio for instance is perfect for beginners (I used to use FL Studio) You do not need to know the keys as you can place the notes quickly and easily where you want them and make quick chord progressions and melody’s and in no time you will have composed something. As you continue to make your compositions, you will naturally get better with this hands on approach. All it takes is a decent system and the desire to create."

cats,ffk6aql,t3_eu23a9,1580017279.0,My Cat figures out how to turn it on herself but she doesn’t turn it off after! Arghh!
cats,ffk5wr5,t3_eu0sbe,1580016911.0,You are a good man! It can be addicting. My sister once had 23 Rescue cats. She rescued her first litter out of a dumpster in Seattle Washington. She was a beautiful person.
