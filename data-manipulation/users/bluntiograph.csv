AskReddit,ff837jq,t3_es1gaf,1579664787.0,"Me and a friend got every thursday off from school by breaking the rules in a specific way, and because of the way it was set up the end result for notification to parents was a letter that had to be signed and returned, no phone call. 

We would ride the bus to school, walk to the gas station a half mile away like we did every day before school, and then just walk another mile to the mall. We would hang out there all day, then walk back to school before it let out,  and then ride the bus back home cause the bus stop was visible from both of our houses. 

I wound up getting into a fight with some kid in gym class in 8th grade, and got suspended, which nets a phone call, so my parents knew about this one. Didnt know about the other stuff that had been going on for the last two years. They decide to appeal the suspension because ""I'm a good kid and deserve to be in school."" Told them nah, it's cool, I can just work hard after I get back and pull my grades up, but they insisted on going to bat for me. 

Sitting at the appeal hearing at the school, and the principal and two counselors were sitting opposite from my folks and me. Vice principal comes in with my file. Its 6 inches thick and sounds like a dictionary being dropped from the second floor of a library when it thuds in front of my dad. My forehead hits the table in despair as I just say ""fuuuuuuuuuuck.""

My parents go through this file, taking ages to look in disbelief at perfectly forged copies of both of their signatures staring back at them. I was always good at art, drawing was really all I did in school for the most part, so it was easy. 

I dont have any memories past that point until the very end of my freshman year of high school, which was right as magic the gathering unlimited went off shelves, as I learned to play it. 

Needless to say when my sister went to that middle school as I suffered through first year high school, she told me the disciplinary system was basically just everything gets a student suspension and phone calls. No more letters, no more gaming the system, fuck up and you just disappear for a while, and your folks know why."

Main differences are you have to carry your own workers comp or a waiver if allowed in your state, commercial insurance, and you have to stick to your appointments no matter what as you are getting work entirely by reputation.
