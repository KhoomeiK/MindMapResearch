ladycyclists,ff3trha,t1_ff147x9,1579548672.0,"A word about ""deals"" buying a bike:

Bike shops don't have a lot of wiggle room. So it's nothing like buying a car and passing a post-it back and forth with the salesman as he says ""let me go talk to my manager"". Your price is what they have. 

The ""deals"" so to speak are on service. A good shop will offer discounts on equipment, come back for a free tune up (a good idea because as you ride the power train stretches), things like free exchange on the seat if you need one, upgrade on parts, discounts on a bike fit and so on. 

So you're really shopping for the bike shop that gives you the best service. Forums will come and go, your friends will roll their eyes at your questions. Find yourself a shop that will be there for you. 

Are you taking the bike to Tuscany or does the tour provide one?"
ladycyclists,ff09sf5,t3_er1jf4,1579466689.0,"That's good information for us. Really helps us quite a bit. 

Are there particular bikes your LBS (local bike shops) carry? Shopping for a bike is not at all like buying a car where one normally has just a few manufacturers. There are hundreds maybe thousands of bike builders when you consider smaller and or custom builds. But unless you're in an urban area with a lot of shops to pick from, sometimes it's best to start with the bike builders you have available and then suggest models from them. Because otherwise I could say ""Go get THIS"" and nobody sells it near you. 

That being said for what you want: short to mid distance riding, able to handle gravel, fat tires a plus, you're biking to work so might want to be able to add a rack and whether the bike goes with you to Tuscany or you're training for the trip you need to be able to handle distance these are some I like.

And what am I doing? Surfing reddit ;-)

If you or anyone you know and or love is 50 or older get that colonoscopy. It's really not that bad, they give you good drugs. You have a day of prep in the bathroom with quality time reading reddit. Do eet. 

But here's the thing again; your doctor says ""Happy 50th birthday! It's time for a routine colonoscopy!"" Why 50? What's magic about the big 5 oh? 

Your doctor would rather have you take that gold standard test at 45, 40 ... earlier based on family history. My wife's tumor had probably been there hanging out, safe and warm in her colon for 10 years. So why 50? 

It's because insurance generally will not pay for the test until you are 50. And early colon cancer is on the rise. Sure, your doctor could use Cologaurd or what we call the ""poop on a stick"" test. But it's not accurate giving more false positives and negatives.

She worked at first but as a treatment plan unfolded and chemo started, and chemo sucks big pointy rocks BTW, she began using up vacation, then FMLA, finally stopped work entirely.

Now decision time; go on COBRA to stay with her care team, or to ACA with a discount but totally different provider and team. We chose COBRA at huge expense plus deductible to keep her awesome team intact. And we’re mighty glad we did. With her diagnosis having a survivability rate of 10% she is here, No Evidence of Disease.

retirement,fehi76j,t1_feh2o2y,1579117051.0,"My guess is her contract will specify qualification for the pension and amounts. Assuming she qualified at the time of retirement her manager should have instructed her how to get that. Or it could have been covered on an exit interview. 


I would call HR or a benefits department whichever she has and explain the situation. It's like in my case I was waffling about the decision; I'd declared retirement, even planned the retirement dinner and then suddenly ""Maybe I'll stay"" because the job was about to change for the better. So I called benefits and asked ""What happens if I just stay?"" ""Well, we'd be confused but we'll figure it out"".

crows,fdpydyw,t3_emj45z,1578645873.0,"They are normally on the way to a roost. Crows roost together en masse in trees for safety. Any sound of approach may be caught by the tree or by an alert crow. 

There’s a roost near me that serves thousands of crows each night. Studies and counts say close to 20,000. Crows head there daily from up to 50 - 60 miles away. As they make their way to the roost often they do mini gatherings. They seem to flock to a point like a tree and when a certain number is met then move on. Or maybe they’re waiting for Fred and Martha to get there (“They’re always late, you know. Remember that party where we were all heading out, party’s over, they show up and scoop up the leftovers and drinks?” ). So we’ll see these huge groups in trees and when they reach a particular mass they all fly further towards the roost.

Numbers are huge now but will dwindle as they mate and nest. During nesting season I’m guessing there may be only single crows, because while they mate for life if a crow looses it’s mate they will normally “remarry”. Also may be young crows who have not mated and perhaps are not helping another pair. Young crows often do not mate themselves their first year or two. Instead they might help “the folks” with their nest thus learning the routine like babysitting your younger sibs. I do not know if these babysitting crows roost near the nest or go to the regular roost. 

Amazing birds though."

As for selling one residence while buying another we managed that by overlapping. We bought the new pad first, moved in while our realtor made minor modifications and fixes to the old joint. Having it empty, clean and fixed made all the difference. It sold for near twice what we paid. 

Both condos, old and new, are single story, in locations near public transportation and recreation options such as cycling and hiking trails. I wanted both because you never know when you can't drive or have to stop. And active motion keeps us both healthier and fit.

cancer,fckzcvg,t3_ehogz2,1577736445.0,"My wife, who has princess tiny, dainty veins, chose to have a port installed. It makes things so much easier. Well not that cancer is easy but it's just one less thing to manage. They can use the port for chemo and even whatever the bleep she gets for CAT scans. Very handy for a lot of treatments. 

Now that treatment is ended she has to get it flushed every few weeks. I forget the exact schedule. I would need to check her calendar but your mom's oncologist can tell you and schedule it. Our oncologist told us that if her next CAT scan is clear as well, then she could have it removed. It's not a permanent thing. 

If she gets a port you may find just a couple of inconveniences. We keep a small very soft scarf in the car; silk, cashmere, something like that. This gets wrapped around the shoulder harness. Otherwise the harness rubs on the port a little. It's worse when she's a passenger. Not a problem when she drives. 

You'll want to chose clothing that makes accessing the port easier during treatments. For women that's mostly a women's style deeper neckline, or kind of like a Henley with buttons ... experiment with fashion. I'm sure many here will have ideas. 

The skin around the port may seem drier. You do not want anything remotely even near or in the port but a mild unscented massage oil or skin cream near the area can help. 

She also might get lymphoma, swelling at the shoulder or under arm. Your oncologist or a lymphoma specialist can help. There are ways that she or a cargiver can relieve that. You want to look into that so the swelling does not become permanent. 

But even with all that, a port is a wise idea. We even had one nurse, a breast cancer survivor, who simply left her port in so she can demonstrate it's use and management to patients.

We have a friend, a neighbor who is very religious and said she is setting up a prayer wheel for my wife. I don't even know what that is ;-) And when I told her ""Thanks. We're not believers per se but I appreciate the support"" I got such a look! But this neighbor really came through for us for example planning meals for me, the beliegered care giver when care taking was difficult. And even a celebratory dinner for us when my wife's treatment was done (and is successful so far!). 

When people thank God for her recovery I just respond that ""We're thankful to her care team, nurses, doctors, surgeons. We bring them chocolate. I can't bring chocolate to God."" Well, I'm maybe not that snarky but that is what I feel. My feelings about religion and my spirituality are complex. But it may come down to that we do what we can as best we can. If at the end of the day you've done all that you can do then maybe it's time to ask the higher power of your choice. But during this endeavor I was simply too busy caregiving and doing what needed to be done to ask the flying spaghetti monster for help. And you know who was really, verifiably, truly, actually there for us? Doctors, nurses, techs, care professionals. So if there is a God it's them. 

There will be those who want or need religion. And that's fine if they do. But I do not want to be involved in proving their hypothesis. In other words they have the belief that God solves all things. And you have cancer, and they prayed for you, and you do better or maybe even go into remission or NED. So it works! They're right! You're the proof. 

Go find yourself something else to experiment on or maybe (like in my fiends case) go ahead and pray for us but do something useful too. I know that messes with the experiment because now we don't know if prayer worked or if it was that you helped with caregiving.
