WatchPeopleDieInside,ff6pstq,t3_eru2yh,1579632347.0,"My first driving experience was with my dad in a very large, empty, movie theatre parking lot. My dad would create a mock scenario “ok, stop here. A car is approaching from the right. Now turn left.” etc... a few minutes later he said “Watch out for that car coming from the left” except this time it was an actual car and I was just going through the motions by this point. Luckily we just missed a collision, and that’s how I almost got t-boned by the only other car is a giant empty parking lot."
