I agree with you that hard work is what will take someone to greatness. However, hard work has limitations. You can only go to your physical limits if it is something athletic for example. 

No matter how hard someone who is 5’1 works they will never be able to compete against Lebron James who also works hard but was gifted a 6’8 frame. No matter how hard someone with impaired vision works they will never be the best fighter pilot. So obviously physical limitations can impact your success regardless of effort. 

The same limitations exist in business. You could know all your shit and put together the best presentation you could ever do but if someone is more attractive than you and has more “natural charisma” and they also know all their shit and put together an equally impressive presentation then they will win the account. 

To say that the advantage is only 2% is wrong. If both parties do all the same hard work then the advantage is 100%."

politics,ff8nooe,t1_ff6m02d,1579687716.0,"In 1980 a right wing party was created in the west(Alberta) known as the reform party. It was struggling along with the progressive conservative party(Centre-right). They merged in 2003 to become the new Conservative party of Canada. The two combined bases won the election in 2004. 

So for the majority of our independence we had almost all left leaning parties(3 major) and only one major party that was centre-right. 

It’s only been 15 years that a Conservative party has existed and because of that we probably won’t see someone like Andrew Scheer get elected because he’s not conservative enough for the radical rights and too conservative for the Centre-rights that make up the Conservative party. 

Harper understood the balance of supporting liberal views of morality(mostly) while advocating conservative views on economy."

You’re looking for fit guys. Don’t ask guys for nudes that tell you they are average-fit and then tell them you want someone more fit.

That being said, if those averages are considered true then the average grandparent is in their early 50’s and the average adult in their 50’s works full time. 

So this is why I believe grandparents aren’t seeing their grandkids as often. Because they are working more than they used to.
