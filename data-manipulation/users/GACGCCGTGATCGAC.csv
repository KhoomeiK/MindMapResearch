If you watch basketball, it's undeniably funny because of the word play.  If you don't watch basketball, it comes off as a normal response to someone dying young in a tragic accident.  And the heavy part is that any basketball fan must have understood the joke, laughed at it, and then felt sad.  Because ""Kobe passing"" actually makes you question your own mortality, since no one expected it and it ""can't be true.""

Let Lamb come off the bench.  He isn't a defensive liability off the bench and can dominant the ball more.  He is wasted in a starting line-up with Sabonis and Warren.

Really, we are talking about small differences in offensive efficiency.  I think Lamb starting is dumb because his real skill is offense.  We need a 3&D player (Justin Holiday?) to start at SG.  None of it really matters, though, since Oladipo comes back within the next week."

There was a time when I could have made a post like, ""Paul George is a superstar,"" and people would have laughed.  YOU see all the talent, but can't understand how other's do not.  Doesn't matter once you are in the playoffs because people are forced to watch. PG delivered some lame games for OKC, but he always elevated his game in the playoffs with the Pacers.  PG's crossover and then dunk on birdman in the ECF is one of the most ridiculous plays I've ever watched live.  Those moments are what make a superstar.  Trae needs those moments but it will only happen when people are forced to watch him play, like in the playoffs.

Point is, if you have a small fanbase or small market team, the only way for casual fans to respect your team or players is to make the playoffs and really challenge the teams in the spotlight.  Trae's an INSANE offensive player, but he will constantly be disrespected until he makes it to the playoffs and has the ability to showcase his talent.

science,ffdsu68,t1_ffdpknr,1579828056.0,"That is my interpretation as well.  If all the bits on a harddrive are 0 or 1, then the drive would be in equivalent states.  It's either 'ON' (all compartments store 1) or it's 'OFF' (all compartments store 0).  There is literally no more information content other than those two states, if all compartments are 1 OR 0.  The information on the drive is 100% predictable and certain.  It must be in one state or the other, but not both.  



To illustrate how ridiculous this would be, if you had a 1 terabit harddrive, you have a MASSIVE number of ""compartments"" to store 0 OR 1 (1 x 10^12 ).  So in the ON/OFF situation above, ALL 1,000,000,000,000 compartments would have to be 0 OR 1.  That is a massive waste of space.  The same amount of information could be stored in a single bit (1 OR 0).  Which is why you can compress redundant information if it doesn't have an affect on the overall state.  If I have a terabit of information in which all my bits are on (1) or off (0), then why am I wasting a terabit?  Might as well compress the message down to a single bit which does the same thing without insane redundancy.



On the otherhand, if the harddrive is half-filled with 1's and half-filled with 0's, then the information content of the harddrive is maximum, because each bit can be in either state (0 OR 1) with equal likelihood;

bit 1 == 0 OR 1
bit 2 == 0 OR 1 
... 
bit 1*10^12 == 0 OR 1


Which gives you the maximum combinations information could be organized on the harddrive.  The bits are unpredictable or ""random"" at this point because, compared to all 1's or all 0's, this is the least predictable state."
science,ffdkszz,t1_ffbz1v2,1579822987.0,"Nice explanation.  I haven't had a chance to read the paper so maybe the paper discusses this, but why assume the methylation is selected for and not the underlying DNA sequence?  Perhaps the DNA sequence is more likely to be methylated, and the DNA sequence is actually what is being selected for.  I realize a majority of studied methylated genes are silenced, but that doesn't necessarily mean they aren't in some way impacting the fitness of an organism.  

I suppose it is a bit of a chicken or egg situation; is the metyhlation pattern or DNA which happens to be more likely to be methylated selected first."
science,ffdiutd,t1_ffddv4l,1579821795.0,"I'm generally curious, why do you find this interesting?  Assuming that info/bits and mass are 1:1, then you'd expect something like this wouldn't you?

1 bit weighed 1 x 10^-38 kg

terabit in kg = (1 x 10^12 ) * (1 x 10^-38 ) = 1 x 10^-26 kg

Unless the people who created this did some genetic engineering to create many ""off"" switches, it's possible something like this could devastate an ecosystem.

For instance, imagine this sort of ""organism"" made it's way into an actual frog.  What happens then?  Does the frog's immune system kill this organism which is almost identical to itself?

Don't get me wrong, it fucking sucks, especially if you attempt to move your leg (or whatever surrounds the dislocation).  That actually hurts like fucking shit.  But once you realize you can't move shit and ice it, it really isn't so bad, despite looking gnarly as fuck.  My knee dislocation happened in a college gym during an intramural game in peak hours.

It was a nice change of pace and all of those characters [Snoop, Chris, and Omar] were authentic.  All of their actions had meaning within the story and were driven by the larger events of the story.  They had some characteristics which felt dramatized, but their characters had enough authenticity to get away with it.

Probably the most unrealistic character was Brother Mouzone, who I actually liked because he was such a contrast from the typical ""muscle.""  I appear to be in a minority on that."

Nowhere does OP imply a bear finds a deer a day.  That means a group of four bears *could* catch a single deer and feed their caloric needs *assuming they just ate that single deer and nothing else.*  

Your post implied it wasn't possible for a bear to find a deer every four-to-eight days, which is ridiculous based on the ratio of bears-to-deer.  Not only that, but the OP never said they ate ALL deer.  They merely stated a bear could reach it's daily caloric intake by eating a quarter or half a deer.

OP's point is a single deer feeds four beers.  You are taking this far to literally.  I could hit my caloric intake on pizza, but I don't eat one pizza a day."

science,fco8jah,t1_fcldeys,1577826151.0,"That is an interesting observation.  I think the authors try to answer that in the Results section:

> We attribute the limited overlap to the relatively lower coverage of the proteomics data (Fig. 1D).

So the authors attribute this to the limitations of their methods which makes sense to me.  If you can only sequence a small read of amino acids within a protein you are losing a LOT given the degenerative nature of mRNA sequence.

But yeah, definitely interesting.  I think the authors also try to describe the potential difference in overlap:  

> While the majority of the regulated proteins are metabolic enzymes, the majority of the regulated transcripts are associated with signal transduction through the Pi3k-Akt pathway (Fig. 1c; Suppl. Table 3), which plays a pivotal role in regulating organ growth and metabolism across species20,21,22,23.

When they go into hibernation their cells contain high levels of proteins for metabolism, while their mRNAs regulate the ability to communicate between cells.  Makes sense IMO.  Proteins are more stable and when their metabolism speeds up they will need new waves of proteins which allow cell signaling to release stored energy."
