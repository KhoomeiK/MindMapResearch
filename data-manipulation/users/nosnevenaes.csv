But ive also stood at the bedside and watched loved ones die several times also.  Ive lost plenty.  Its just a natural part of life.  Ive also been near death myself.  All these experiences have helped me to be able to understand the cycle a little and most importantly be at peace within it.

I never lost consciousness during the ordeal but i definitely experienced a major shift in conciousness."

LifeProTips,ff7lzbi,t3_es3ogp,1579652730.0,not really the best advice.  yes it can happen but arranged marriages result in less divorces than marriages where people were casually dating and then eventually got married.  getting married because you love somebody isnt really always the best idea either.  getting married to somebody that you can be married to is a better idea.  and you have the rest of your life to work on loving that person.  if you marry for love youre gonna end up doing the same thing but with less success.
