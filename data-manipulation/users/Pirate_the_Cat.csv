AskReddit,fffi21i,t3_etcvy9,1579884420.0,"I haven’t, but I’ve heard two different reasons why. 

1.  They’re drug dealers. 

2. They ran away from home."
AskReddit,fffdddv,t3_etak9h,1579881485.0,"I had a woman ask about our bread options for a sandwich, because the *flatbread* was “too much bread”. She didn’t want it wrapped in lettuce, and she was telling me this as she’s devouring the complementary loaf of honey wheat bread on the table. She also wanted me to cut up fresh strawberries for her strawberry lemonade (we already used natural strawberry pulp, no artificial syrup) but didn’t want to pay extra for the added, fresh strawberries."
AskReddit,fff2en1,t3_etakd4,1579873853.0,"Sometimes you just need a break, or new inspiration for a hobby. If you’re losing interest in a person, I think that’s harder to get back, but not impossible. You have to assess what interests you about them, and why you’re losing interest to figure out which direction to go in."
videos,ffeyw2o,t1_ffehujx,1579870803.0,"Because of the diseases they research and contain. Most new disease outbreaks are zoonotic diseases that originate in animals. Plum island specializes in livestock diseases, they’re the only facility in the US that study Foot and Mouth disease, a disease we have eradicated from our livestock population. They are the only facility in the US, and one of 3 in the world, that studies anthrax. They also study hog cholera, ASFV, and other diseases that all have one thing in common: they’re *foreign* animal diseases that we do not want in the US. But you put that right in the middle of the country, and that could change. My pet food is manufactured in Kansas, so that scares me a bit. We don’t want foreign animal diseases getting into the U.S. wildlife population, mutating, and causing a new epidemic we don’t have a treatment for. Also, the Plum Island facility has already had incidents of disease leaks, but because they’re on an island they were able to control it. 

China is having an outbreak of ASFV right now in their pigs and they’re already losing millions of dollars to it. They’ve lost over a million pigs in a year. Mongolia has lost over 10% of its swine population to ASFV in the last year also. People start caring a lot more about animal diseases when those diseases spread to the human population."
AnimalsBeingBros,ffdo7it,t1_ffdiwp9,1579825069.0,I didn’t say it doesn’t alter their behavior. I said the rat’s behavior doesn’t seem abnormal.
AnimalsBeingBros,ffcxjvk,t1_ff9o6pf,1579809349.0,"Toxoplasmosis is the infection caused by *Toxoplasma gondii*. About 50% of cats have it. They get it from eating rodents, or eating food contaminated with feces from another animal. It’s commonly spread in shelters and group housing situations. It doesn’t usually cause a problem in cats. The main concern is for pregnant women.  
I don’t think Toxoplasma is causing the rats behavior, they’re curious and social by nature. It looks to me like the rat is actually barbering the kitten and trying to establish dominance, probably because his scent is stronger than the kitten’s."

videos,ffcov49,t1_ffcnht8,1579804051.0,"There’s a facility in the US, currently on an island called Plum Island. They’re planning to relocate to Kansas, the facility is currently being constructed. It’s almost inevitable something will get out at some point, it always does. No biocontainment facility to date has ever been able to completely contain 100% of biologics indefinitely."

AskReddit,ffakmik,t1_ffaehdq,1579738100.0,"Yeah I personally do not think Hillary was a good alternative, but I hate the setbacks the Trump administration has created for environmental issues."
AskReddit,ffakh4l,t1_ffacdxf,1579737984.0,"This is my biggest issue with him. Slashing the EPA budget which almost disintegrated the Great Lakes project, anti-vax tweets, denying climate change, challenging science as a whole, overturning pro-environmental acts for the sole purpose of discrediting Obama, running massive pipelines that are highly detrimental to the environment, his proposed rollback of the National Environmental Policy Act, lifting the requirement for oil and gas companies to report emissions, and eliminating a number of other federal regulations that were put in place for a reason. His administration also failed to follow traditional policy for many of these ban-lifts and regulation rollbacks. I also don’t like that he was so pro-2A but has changed his stance.  
Edit: I forgot to mention I dislike how he has changed our foreign relations."
