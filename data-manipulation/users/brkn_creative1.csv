Etsy,fd6v9mf,t3_ek6w32,1578196159.0,"I have about 1500 followers which is far from successful in Instagram terms but I find I gain the most followers by posting as often as possible, really hitting the right hashtags for my cliental and believe it or not I find when I take more amateur photos it pushes the handmade feel further. I do like that most of my followers are constant likers and I donâ€™t have many fake followers if any."

Etsy,fczvb6o,t1_fczqphx,1578109224.0,"I was not discouraging him as my first sentence stated "" having your own website is a smart move"" But was merely replying to his remark  ""the freedom is worth the hit on ""traffic"""""
Etsy,fczkx4k,t1_fcyl03v,1578103480.0,"While having your own website is a smart move to not have all your eggs in one basket, you need to understand itâ€™s not the hit in traffic. For example my website on an average day will have 4 to 5 times the amount of hits as my Etsy ship, meaning if my Etsy shop has 100 hits, my website will have 400-500 hits. The difference is more Etsy shoppers come with the intention of buying something, where as my website is normally just views who saw an ad and clicked on to check the price. At the end of the year with 5x the hits on my website, I will normally only have the same amount of sales as my Etsy store. Donâ€™t kid yourself running your own site is both more expensive and much much more work!"
