misanthropy,fggs4ru,t1_fggrfaq,1580768337.0,"I don’t manipulate anyone, I offer a service that combats that loneliness. How is it manipulation just to offer something? Sex work is just as valid as any other form of work, and as someone who’s been sexually assaulted it gives me the illusion of being in control of my own body which is a comfort to me. If sex is something that someone can be robbed of then surely it can be sold. A majority of the customers I’ve encountered are awful people but it’s better they’re expressing these things to me than terrorizing unwilling others, because I can take it and it’s mutually beneficial. Also, the definition of a thot is someone who has many “casual sexual relationships.” I do not. What makes you feel so superior to everyone, as evidenced in your post?"

BipolarReddit,fged7q6,t1_fgecznv,1580696870.0,"The majority of side effects aren’t safe, but they’re useful in determining what works. That’s why prescriptions are monitored so heavily. I’ve also seen multiple other people on bipolar reddit that have found out they’re bipolar through being prescribed an antidepressant, so it’s either a mistake every time or more common than you think."

BipolarReddit,fgecgle,t1_fgebuj9,1580696386.0,"That’s not my experience and my family’s experience, and I didn’t say a responsible doctor. I was originally prescribed Lexapro even though they suspected bipolar and when I checked back the next week with mania they switched to Lamictal. It’s really not that crazy of a concept because prescribing and diagnosing is a huge gamble anyways, me telling you that often that’s done to rule out bipolar is with people who are presenting with symptoms of depression at the moment before the diagnosis. I’m not saying they diagnose someone bipolar beforehand and then give them antidepressants to make them manic. My first manic episode was caused by SSRI’s, although I did have delusions for years before. Is it hard for you to imagine that doctors prescribe things and then study the effects it has on the patients in order to gain more info? Lmfao"

BipolarReddit,fgea5xg,t3_exycnc,1580694889.0,Doctors prescribe ssris in order to check if someone is bipolar occasionally because it will cause mania in those with bipolar. There’s a reason we become manic on just antidepressants.
