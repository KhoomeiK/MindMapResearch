I have an Omega Seamaster Bond 007 Limited Edition Mens Watch 2226.80.00 MINT Full Set. Condition is excellent.

The watch has remained in its box since I purchased it. It is in great condition and includes its Certificate of Authenticity, international Warranty card, and original packaging.

You will not find another James Bond 007 at this price- this is priced to sell.
