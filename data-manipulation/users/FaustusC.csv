AskReddit,ffjx51r,t3_etts4s,1580009373.0,"""A considerable percentage of the people we meet on the street are people who are empty inside, that is, they are actually already dead. It is fortunate for us that we do not see and do not know it. If we knew what a number of people are actually dead and what a number of these dead people govern our lives, we should go mad with horror.""

I know that even though I'm suffering, at least I'm not empty."
Tinder,ffjfup3,t3_etvwne,1579997366.0,I remember getting postage stamp sized tiddie pics on my color nokia. Fuck. I'd kill to have em for posterity.

nosleep,ffisr2l,t3_etrnpa,1579981786.0,"Y'all need to keep something in mind: The demons are better off torturing people with truth.
Demons telling you God is real and allows suffering to happen is worse for faith than a lie. 
Knowing takes away all the point of faith."

talesfromtechsupport,ffi0qwj,t1_ffi0hao,1579961563.0,LTT showed something like that during one of their wish builds I believe.

40kLore,ffhy54i,t1_ffhse8s,1579958929.0,"To further expand on this: Especially in the 40K universe, you may be called upon to kill things pretending to be your family or friends, potentially something even more innocent. 

Consider the Kaibiles: a real life special forces group. They're forced to raise and live with a puppy. Then... Kill and eat it. That's why there's no punishment. Our real world is cold and cruel. 40ks is even worse. Killing a fellow Aspirant just means you won't hesitate if you see the flickers of chaos or are given the order to fire by someone who does."

You're either a paid shill or the worst human on the planet. Either way, Winnie the Pooh will never notice you."
AskReddit,fffgkcu,t1_ffeirfx,1579883491.0,I wouldn't. They'll make you eat the rat.
ftlgame,fff87fa,t1_fff2ub4,1579878145.0,"See, the thing is though, we don't know that for sure. The Chinese government is keeping everything locked down so tightly, it's impossible for us to verify that. 
It's deeply concerning that they'd shut down civilian internet access over *flu season* if it's as minimal as you say."
facepalm,fff76sk,t1_ffem0l5,1579877444.0,"... because the check showed as ""VOID"". IE, Fraudulent. And the writer would not verify the authenticity.

So he showed up, made slightly suspicious requests with checks the writer wouldn't admit to that also came up as void when inspected. 

But. Because he's black, that's not suspicious?"
facepalm,fff71t2,t1_ffem39s,1579877347.0,Plenty of other ways? Like the ones that they claim showed the check as void? Like attempting to contact the paying party who refused to verify?
facepalm,ffehang,t3_et1yu3,1579847981.0,"A man walks into a bank, with nothing in his accounts. He tries to deposit 2 high value checks and cash a 3rd, while requesting a brand new debit card.
And y'all think that wasn't red flag worthy?
The teller who waited on him was black too. Smdh"
discworld,ffe0lqd,t3_et0nbz,1579833609.0,I would literally pay money to have a copy of this so I could frame it.
science,ffd2p64,t1_ffd0q9x,1579812238.0,"NFA for one. The magazine/stock bans.

Think of it this way: a Society that hates speeders. 
They stop imports of ""fast cars"". Then, they ban Turbos and wastegates under the guise of ""BUT WE DIDN'T BAN THE CAR ITSELF!!!"" But then slowly, they ban any accessory that potentially adds to the cars speed until you're left with nothing but bone stock."

Retailers need to just start marking demo units at 900x the retail price to stop morons like him from pulling this.
Yeah, it means having a 20,000 price tag on a tooth brush, but it means an end to this crap."
