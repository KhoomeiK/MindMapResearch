worldnews,fejqk65,t1_fejktn9,1579183331.0,Stop abusing the word miracle. It is not a fucking miracle. Its science. Lots of research and time spent into making this happen.

adultsurvivors,fed5i1o,t3_eo9u3w,1578999871.0,"I've found an interesting way to explore blocked memories. I love to have phone sex with older guys, and lately I've noticed myself more comfortable talking about my CSA to these random phone guys...It has kind of, in a small way, alleviated my anxiety about my CSA and unlock a memory or two! I swear. Its cathartic. Maybe bc I'm in such a good mood while phoning and the conversation is about my CSA, it's almost like some therapy shit lol"

Lexus,fdqe6o2,t1_fdpo7qt,1578664328.0,"I did the same. Til I ran into a very respected car detailer in the Tampa area, he said the headlight cleaners, no matter how much you spend, will last as long as spraying on bug spray."

Lexus,fdnr1dw,t3_em6gs5,1578591167.0,"I know this will sound silly, but try applying some bug spray with DEET to that left headlight. More DEET ratio the better. It makes them look almost new! I swear!"
aww,fdklhws,t1_fdkfm16,1578506021.0,"Lol I'm having a great day. I just cant stand people that humanize animals. The city I live in has an insane overpopulation of deer, with some of the highest transmission rates of Lyme disease in the country. All because the precious animal lovers don't allow culling herds due to dumb trucks like you that find them ""cute"" and feed them."
aww,fdkf0dk,t3_eln2x3,1578502474.0,"Cute ""Darcy"" is gonna have offspring and will fail to show them how to properly find food in winter because you're too fuckin dumb to realize feeding wild animals goes against their survival abilities. Good job, you just doomed her fawns"
aww,fdjtyly,t3_eln2x3,1578487399.0,Nothing like making Darcy dependent on your fucking apples in winter to really help the herd learn how to feed themselves.

Rapekink,fc5zpvv,t3_egbwo0,1577469157.0,"I've done this similarly...I was on a trail, known for dudes prowling to fuck, and it was dark...had a guy following me, I slowed down a lil and smiled back at him. He eventually grabs my hips from behind, pulls my shorts down and starts sliding in. I'd act like I didn't want it and start walking away. He again would grab my hips and slide a little more in. We did this like 3 or 4x times til I couldn't help it and came on the spot. Felt so fucking good and a little rapey"
conspiracy,fc3yzg6,t1_fc3ufkk,1577402272.0,"I just cant get behind any of that doomsday talk. There are things that benefit is from living in fear, being consumed with it.

Oh so my 100ish years of existence is going to sort me to the good place or bad place, forever and always, is so silly because the universe 4+ BILLION years old!!!! Get over this blink of an existence determining eternal fate. It's so dumb. Stop fearing total unknown"

Yet when you finish with ""But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned."" Its just pure nonsensical talk. You're forcing to believe because you dont want it to be false. The evidence is based on pure woowoo in the end."

conspiracy,fc2u3fu,t1_fc2tr4d,1577374075.0,"I think religion was created to make men weak and not overthrow the elite. For men to give up any credit that we accomplished something, to say ""it was God's work"" or ""a miracle"". We give our own lives meaning. The universe is mindblowing massive, and old.

They may well be, but it is still an assumption based purely on your perspective. I just find it incredibly strange that a 2000yr old story written by the same creatures (humans) that have written other religious texts that are obviously false and pure fiction, is still controlling so many points of this world. Could it be possible that some parties are doing things to make events seem as though the bible prophecies are being fulfilled to ignite their slav..I mean followers? Absolutely."
