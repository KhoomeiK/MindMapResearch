I have found the Vyvanse helps me in the sense that, it's easier for me to use the skills I learned in therapy, rather than just sitting there thinking about it. 



One thing that helped me do much was to actually physically write down the things I want to get done in the week. Whenever I feel I my burst if energy to do something, I look at my list and pick something I have the energy for. Sometimes I have to psych myself up to do some or the more challenging things but it helps. 



There's just something about crossing stuff off the list that makes me want to do more stuff. It's like having the tasks in a video game."
NoStupidQuestions,fgkpew6,t3_ez1jie,1580870711.0,"Well there's lots of stuff to experience in other cultures. 


I enjoy traveling because I like meeting new people and trying new foods. I also am very interested in things like Ancient Rome. The remember seeing pictures of all the amazing ruins and just in awe that people built all of that without the good technology we have today. 


I also enjoy ecotourism. I have my college degree in Environmental studies, and there are some things that have to see in person to believe it exists. I learned to scuba dive in California, and I'm originally from Chicago, so being in a kelp forest around s bunch of cool animals, was probably one of the coolest things I have ever done in my life. My instructor opened up a sea urchin and I fed a fish with my own hands. After that I wouldn't shut up about it. I told everyone about it. 


But for some people, adventure isn't for them. Some people like that things they already have around them and that's ok too.


Thankfully the United States is diverse enough to allow you to explore other cultures without having to go to far."

So first thing I'd make sure all of the factories I have meet the same standards as best to my ability. (For example, if I had a factory in India, I'd pay the workers the same as I did in the United States.)


I'd be pretty strict about water usage and other resource management, and make an extra effort for environmental mitigation. (For example, I'd buy property in the area I'm taking resources from for the sake of preservation, and more importantly make sure I don't pollute the water) 


Obviously for both it those things I'd have to adhere to local laws that prevent me from doing this kinda stuff. But hopefully with some well funded advocacy I'd be able to help change the laws for the better.

personalfinance,fgkay6c,t1_fgk9azs,1580861354.0,"Yeah, my general rule is that don't lend money you can't stand to lose unless you have a written contract. 


Even in really amicable loans and deals it's good because sometimes money changes people. My family right now is going through a lot if inheritance bullshit right now and everyone involved is acting terribly. They have never been this bad with each other ever. 



Thankfully there were important things in writing and my mom was able to hold my aunt accountable with money that was spent for the funeral.


With the amount of money you are dealing with, it would be fair to even get a more formal contract written up that has witnesses. I don't think you have to go as far as hiring a lawyer, unless something comes up, but definitely keep good documentation of everything to do. Like record the details of the day you agree to the loan, keep a file of the payments and checks. That way no one can try the whole ""I didn't get paid/I thought I already paid"" lie to make an extra dime. I know it's really pessimistic to think if your family that way, but some people lie to the family members for the sake of money.

NoStupidQuestions,fgjumvk,t3_eyu4f6,1580851712.0,"""while"" describes a period or time in between events. Most people use this to describe the passage of time between routine or regularly planned events. 


Examples: ""I missed many AA meetings because it has been a while since I left the house"" or ""I'm going to have to wait a while for my sandwich because the first one got burnt""


""Once in a while"" is used to describe frequency over a period of time. So people would use to describe something not happening as it was originally planned. 

Examples: ""I only go to AA meetings once in a while because I am trying to avoid going to the liquor store on the way home."" Or ""Ordering takeout is a once in a while treat for me since I'm trying to get better at cooking"""
NoStupidQuestions,fgjsycb,t3_eyu7kx,1580850782.0,"Costume changes can happen in different ways but most if it is designed to be ripped off quickly so that the artist can go right back to performing. It's mostly why a lot if the costumes are seemingly ""skimpy"" because having a lot of fabric makes it hard to change quickly. Lots of times, there will be parts to the outfits so that there can be multiple ""reveal"" moments. 



Usually there will also be some stage direction to create a distraction while the artist is getting changed. Sometimes the dancers will huddle around the artist while a couple of the other dancers or stage hands will do the change if they have to add more clothing or expose private parts. 


Like when all the kids came out to sing, jlo went to the back of the stage and got the flag cape from someone who was standing there ready to put it on her for her. 


There's also usually special stage mechanics that might let the artist drop down below the stage to get completely undressed and have a completely different outfit.  This would likely happen while the other performers are on stage. Shakira probably did that while jlo was doing her part."

Couldn't you argue that it provides an unsafe work environment? I mean, legally they  have to make sure that the workplace is safe for everyone who is there. Meaning, they may be required to build a daycare since your office wasn't designed for babies. I'm not a lawyer but if you or your coworkers are at risk for getting sick or injured because of the children being there, your company could get sued up the asshole for it.

One of my close friends from childhood was diagnosed with schizophrenia when we were in high school. His meds slow him down a lot and he isn't very expressive. He can get overwhelmed pretty easily which is hard to manage in a grocery store. He bags and cleans mostly. He's still a person with interests and hobbies. He loves to talk about music and movies. His sister is getting married but he hopes he doesn't have to give a speech. He's very much still the person I used to play Mario kart and Pokemon with. We talk about our old friends from back then. 

 One thing I noticed how coworkers do was playing ""the price is right"" with the grocery tab. The cashier and my friend would look at the cart and try to guess the price. They let me guess too even though I kinda already knew since I was sticking to a budget. The cashier won and he gave himself a sticker. It's no pressure and it's fun. Customers fucking love it.

AskReddit,fgj2dfq,t3_eyqsc4,1580835666.0,"I worked retail with people who had significant disabilities. 


For the most part, customers were pretty understanding since there were some visual and auditory social cues that out them for their disability. 


One time a customer got really upset with a co-worker with disabilities for struggling to help find a product. As soon as I saw the incident, I told one of my supervisors right away to maybe check on my coworker to see if he was ok. Getting yelled at is stressful for anyone, and it's much harder to deal with I'd you have a disability on top of it. I explained my coworker did everything he was supposed to do, and left when it was appropriate. The customer seemed to be having a bad day or didn't realize who this person was, but he really was a bully to my coworker. It broke my heart.


After my supervisor chatted with him he seemed fine and had a moment to collect himself. 


The best thing I can think of, is ask yourself, ""how would I like to be treated, if I said something out of line, even if I didn't intend to be mean or inappropriate?"" 


There's usually a way to give criticism in a kind way, it just takes some creativity and honesty.

Also, most people who work who have significant disabilities will have an advocate to help (like a legal guardian or a social worker). Sometimes companies will reach out to them to see if there's anything the store can do to be more helpful. Usually for reviews and related things require them to be there so that your coworkers don't get railroaded by management. Sometimes is better to have your supervisors give constructive criticism especially if it means an advocate is there."

I wound up getting so sick I had to call out of work, which I had already been doing a lot that couple months before that. So that call out was the last straw for work and I got fired. 


I haven't been able to get a job since. Trying to kill myself made everything so much worse. And having to tell people was the absolute worst. I never ever want to look a friend in the eyes again and tell them I tried to kill myself. I have never seen a more heartbroken expression in my whole life. It's like the sheer thought of me not being there, broke his heart do badly it ruined his whole fucking day. The only time I've ever seen that look before, was at my grandmother's funeral, and seeing my grandpa having to say goodbye. 


I hope whatever brought up these feelings, isn't worth having to go through the trauma of trying to kill yourself. I'm sure I was pretty close to death that night, but for whatever reason, my body held on to it's last thread. I really should have died. My doctor was shocked it didn't. But here I am.

I had a tutor, who was originally my 2nd grade teacher, and she helped me in ways that no saint could outdo. she was patient with me, and talked to me like a person and not someone who has a significant learning disability. She even advocated for me when my 5th grade teacher decided to be a dick about a final project. (He tried to get out of letting me have accomodations for it which is illegal).

I also had a tutor in high school who basically had to teach me an entire huge concept in math in about two weeks so I didn't have to drop down to the easier math class. I wanted to be in geometry do badly I went in every morning during my free time to learn more math. I had extra work and I still got a B+ I'm geometry, after starting with a C-.

That's how you sound. Its stupid, what's the point of even clarifying what the person's relationship preferences are? The sentence should just be ""sometimes bisexual people can be homophobic too, it seems to be a problem in all the communities.""


Clarifying who the bisexual is dating, and what gender they are doesn't contribute anything positive to the conversation. You make it sound like only bisexual women who date straight guys are homophobic, when in fact, anyone from any walk of life can be homophobic. Nothing about anyone makes them special enough to get a free pass to be homophobic.

Abusive relationships are messy, and complicated, and it's very hard to figure out who's telling the truth if there isn't a lot of evidence. There's lots of types of abuse and some of them are really really hard to prosecute because people suck at being honest. 

I'm inclined to believe Johnny Depp's story, but I could be wrong too. I also have to consider that Jonny Depp might also be omitting important details that change the context of what happened."
rant,fgbla27,t1_fgb8kxu,1580663319.0,"A lot of it has to do with tone and context. 


A good comparison I'd when someone refers to any race as ""those people"".  On paper it probably seems pretty mild, and in a lot of contexts its not a big deal. 


But when it's Thanksgiving and your drunk Uncle is ranting how ""those people"" are not welcome in America, it's racist. 


It's a passive way of being disrespectful. I mean using only the term ""females"" for all women, makes people sound like an evil villain who's so jaded that they can't even refer to women as women. A lot if it stems from incels and people like that. 


Odds are you are being respectful, but just be mindful of how you pick your words."

Like, it literally looks like something out of a cookie cutter guitar manufacturer that mass produced the same thing in every color."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fg7kb6f,t1_fg7k9oq,1580594587.0,Ok fair enough. Lol

And I'm sure my comic Con this year will be fun. There's always something cool each year."
ATBGE,fg7acy4,t1_fg75gu3,1580587733.0,Exactly! I love the colors too. It looks like something a rock star would use as part of a specific look. People are so judgmental...
dogs,fg79zxb,t1_fg76yss,1580587486.0,You seem old enough to know better that talking this way to people isn't very mature either. Let people enjoy shit. If you hate people talking like that then maybe avoid dog people and dog related subreddits.

answers,fg6yiad,t1_fg6tocc,1580579826.0,"Actually one of the only other times that something like this happened (at least that comes to mind), is the Christians taking over pagan territory, and then adopting pagan practices. 


I'm being general about this so if there's details I got wrong or left out, please correct me."

AnimalCrossingNewLeaf,fg00dfc,t1_ffzzr5n,1580397387.0,"Yeah that's kinda why I like games like this do much. Like you don't even have to play yourself. I just like putting fun clothes on a character. 


The Sims is the same way. You can get really specific with the gender settings for each sim. Like you can have any combination of genitals to gender to who gets who pregnant. It's wild. I honestly didn't think I'd ever see a game with that level of freedom."

ForensicFiles,ffynite,t1_ffyk05o,1580350638.0,"Yeah same. I was always under the impression that people found it kinda normal to bring a balloon or a cupcake to a grave as a way to remember a dead loved ones' birthday. I mean maybe it seemed unusual to have a full blown party but by no means would I deem that as ""evidence"" that she's heartless."

Also it turns out I have a total of 4 characters that you need. So I guess we'll have to time travel 3 times? (I'm bad at math so don't quote me on that)"
