... so we cancelled our trip today. Gonna do it Friday instead, where we'll have a sitter, and he'll be around 2 other dogs that he... tolerates."

antiMLM,fgfa1mc,t1_fgdjgtp,1580731840.0,"I remember working for a make up store,  a bit like sephora. And the high profile makeup brands would pay for us to come to conferences, pay hotel with spa but no food. All we had to do was show up on an adress, in walking distance from the hotel (or they would have payed a bus/taxi) to listen to, how their creams were superior, how they would penetrate the epidermis deeper than any other creams, and the science behind it. Afternoons was for makeup tutorials. And we left one week later with our ""signature"" ""parfume"", a few drops of our choice, in a teeny tiny bottle. The store gave us 200€ which was for food. We just had to save every receipt.  

That was fond memories. The high profile brand would see an excellent sales rate in the coming weeks, after our conferences, which benefited the store and the franchise. Which also made the high profile brands compete against each other. By giving us the best treatments. So many years later, and I'm still fond of the brand, when buying makeup. 

If pyramid schemes truly believed in what they sold. They would do the same."

wholesomebpt,fg1rvoz,t1_fg1evd7,1580432291.0,"I had sort of the same ephinay with my niece, 7 months at the time. And we were playing peekaboo, with her wanting to hide her face. Sometimes not well enough to actually cover her face, so I would tell I could see her. And she readjusted the fabric, or teddy, or what she used to cover her eyes. And everytime I said ""where's baby?"" She would toss the teddy aside. So precious."
