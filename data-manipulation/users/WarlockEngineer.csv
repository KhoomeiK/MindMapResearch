A corpsman found him and started first aid, then the corpsman was attacked by a Japanese soldier but managed to shoot him. Jack was tied to a stretcher and loaded on a ship, then large waves made the ship tilt and his stretcher slid all the way to the edge of the ship before someone secured him.

-His fall from the plane was 3500 feet but he executed a perfect rolling technique and was back in the air two weeks later.
