PurplePillDebate,ffw5ykd,t1_ffvmp4j,1580285872.0,"You're confusing respect with either courtesy or lies.

Men generally don't respect by default. At best they'll be not rude. You gotta have something going for you. This is doubly true for getting respect because you aren't gonna be respected by default. This is why the PPD version of Chad who comes up in discussion is way more muscular and rich than most actual guys who fuck in real life.

A man won't respect a woman by default because he won't respect anyone by default. He's just more likely to lie because game is mostly mental and making a woman feel respected and important matters. Since a lot of women(not all, probably not most) are used to lies they don't really act in a way an average man would consider respectable. So they don't get actual, sincere respect."
PurplePillDebate,ffw5kt6,t1_ffw042y,1580285361.0,Yeah. I think the difference is women have the advantage in early stage dating when men are doing performance stuff and men have the advantage once a threshold gets crossed. So women thing it's fair to date around and go on a bunch of first dates and sleep with who they're attracted to. The fact that a dude can only get the same advantage by essentially plating seems mean but that's mainly because they never have to look at anything else from the other side.

Suicides are skyrocketing. Wages don't match real job effort or inflation. The healthcare system costs the most in the world but is constantly overworked and undermanned and not serving what it needs to.

People are just plain coping more because they need to. If you aren't succeeding you aren't getting that dopamine hit and you're going to feel crappy and live in a crappy situation. You're going to turn to fast food because sugar and grease is a controllable variable that'll make you feel less crappy for 10 minutes. So people will turn to sugar and grease as much as alcohol or drugs to feel better. All of these problems are correlated with education and income despite the fact that stupidity doesn't make you fat and being fat doesn't make you poor.

I was fucking monstrously huge a few years ago. Because I was broke and jobless and sat at home trying to break into a field that was barely taking anybody and my major became useless as I was studying it.

Once you go through a lift of broad traits that are favored by the majority and have someone who fits that you've cut out a majority of dudes before getting down to who's artsy vs a manly man. Even if an individual woman will compromise on a few and be real she probably is still firm on many or even most of the others. 

This isn't even theoretical. I actually went to art school. Most of the women were still into traditionally attractive dudes and I was there when Tinder took off and they all loved talking about it.

Modern life is about men being dominated by women in their formative years. Most younger grades and day care and babysitting is run overwhelmingly by female authority figures. Most single parent households are run by women. Most dudes subconsciously think of women as having some kind of authority over them. This also means those women punish young boys harder for the same thing and that masculine behaviors are often penalized when they begin to form.

Most women also don't want to be dominated by most men. Lets get real every other female user here who talks about being a sub has also mocked the idea of doing any of that shit with an orbiter or a simp or any guy that isn't a hottie even if they're playing games with those dudes, as some posters will cop to doing.

PurplePillDebate,ffp20t5,t3_eufj3b,1580084583.0,"Disagree. Most other great apes aren't monogamous(especially the ones closest to humans) and so I doubt there was some switch moment before civilization began that suddenly turned humans that way.

Monogamy is *great* for a caveman looking to make civilization. It makes tracking lineages easy with clay and ochre and cave walls and carvings. It establishes hard boundaries for who is and isn't in a group that benefits from hunts and harvests. It lets you trade offspring if you lack other resources or have an imbalance in your group. It lets you dot your i's and cross your t's and turn a bunch of hairy primates into an orderly society you can designate and order around and have do things.

Monogamy is *awful* for a caveman who wants to be a dumb ape and just do ape things. Less powerful males reproduce. Less fertile females get paired off and have more chances. Less viable offspring from both are cared for by two designated parent. Individuals will pair off with other individuals they don't necessarily have instinctual attraction to and get told to suck an egg.

PurplePillDebate,ffisxjb,t1_ffhucpx,1579981916.0,Yeah basically every woman in my family assumes I either get laid like tile or could if I put in a slight modicum of effort more; because I have a few things going for me and they have less on their list but get hit on by dudes of quality. They really don't get how much more a dudes gotta have or the effort you gotta take.
PurplePillDebate,ffisnn8,t1_ffhxyj1,1579981717.0,You're old so lemme give you the benefit of the doubt but your stereotypical person slinging incel around like an insult isn't another dude. Its an insecure young woman who tags facebook groups and tries that same shit on Pick Mes.
PurplePillDebate,ffhiz7d,t3_etmmdz,1579937394.0,Beauty and the Beast was a metaphor for arranged marriage interpreted by a bunch of tradcon white dudes working out of a compound in California. I'm not saying it's the most or least unrealistic thing in the movie but you gotta be aware who's writing the material.
PurplePillDebate,ffhit73,t3_etls7p,1579937175.0,"Just the opposite in fact! There's a slight bias to males at birth. Men tend to die younger even in modern times so somewhere in their 30's a population demographic will reverse to mostly female.

You need to understand biology is a highly non sentimental thing. Males are more immediatley viable on a macro level due to physical power and thus are produced more. Women are more immediatley *valuable* since making a new human that can act on it's own takes multiple years after conception. This has only created societal differences in modern times because automation steadily kills the need for physical power while reducing the time a woman spends rearing children is still a pipe dream beyond shaving off fractions.

This is the same as say, plants and animals that die shortly after reproduction, or are wounded in the birthing process, or a million other organisms out there. Yeah it sucks to be the one in the situation but nature doesn't care so long as you nut and make a replacement."
PurplePillDebate,ffhh6zt,t1_ffhe6xh,1579935082.0,You know what if a woman was that concerned with my orgasm then sure but I already gotta bring a shit ton to the table to get considered by someone putting in less effort.

PurplePillDebate,ffhc6yf,t1_ffhbqfj,1579929551.0,It's obvious right now you're just playing blame game and trying to put dudes in the hot seat rather than being open to having your view changed.
PurplePillDebate,ffgxlc4,t1_ffgrw9a,1579917656.0,I know the difference and legit prefer actual no makeup. Yeah your lips don't pop and your eyes aren't contoured but theres something to be said for the rawness of it.
todayilearned,ffgoqs8,t3_eteezt,1579911236.0,Oh as in **cola**. Man I assumed a whole lot of other stuff from this headline.
PurplePillDebate,ffg2hou,t3_etfvlq,1579897037.0,"My sister sometimes hangs around sluts, either because they're friends of friends or because they hung out as kids. She has absolutely no respect for them even though they aren't going after the same guy and their thottery doesn't actually affect her.

I think in a real sense some women just have an aversion to sluts the same as men. I'm not a woman so I can't say if this is true or why though."
PurplePillDebate,ffg2adm,t3_etfnoo,1579896911.0,"It depends on what you're looking for and who you are. There was this one woman I knew with weird proportions. She looked like a midget scaled up to normal human height. She met her BF on Tinder, and he was a standard vaguely not overweight dude who did blue collar work. It didn't sound like a huge ordeal for her.

Meanwhile I see some other women who are also weird or else overweight or single moms and they're literally on these apps for *years* at a time. Any time I download the apps I'll match with a small group of repeats pretty consistently. But these women aren't attractive, want to play aloof hot girl games, and are also holding out for a top guy.

Women who actually want dates and not NSA sex and aren't delusional seem to get them with guys willing to go for romance. It's just that there are women who severely overestimate themselves or not understand what a lot of guys there want and they're the ones who get burned."
PurplePillDebate,fffxafe,t3_etezwp,1579893823.0,"Most of the older women I've known who are single tend to be either looking but somehow never developed a realistic idea of what men are like, or else are fixated on some one that got away. I wouldn't call them happy simply because they're laboring over something they don't have an ability to fix.

But that's my morality and they'd tell you something different, either sincerely or to save face."
PurplePillDebate,fffx0u3,t1_fffr71t,1579893659.0,">Which is why it's comical when girls here try to whitewash that.

It's one of those things you either don't believe because you've never seen it, or downplay because you know people who do it and never have to deal with the consequences."
PurplePillDebate,fffwq6b,t1_ffftf1s,1579893473.0,That's random and not really related to my point.
MawInstallation,fffo970,t1_ffflrxy,1579888216.0,"Those do exist ...in tabletop games and some spinoff material.

Star Wars is Star *Wars*. It's fundamentally about people who want to save the galaxy or control it and some random guys doing their own thing in a corner don't factor into this."
MawInstallation,fffo1c7,t1_fffi3j6,1579888085.0,"Yeah, because the EU started primarily with some tabletop games so the assumption is everyone in a species is roughly similar, so players know what they're getting into and GM's have a framework to build off off. When the lore was written it was written so regular people without much experience could write stories, not million dollar authors.

NuCanon is primarily oriented around movies and TV shows, where you need large and diverse casts. So all that stuff got changed. Except even though characters can act different from the norm Star Wars is now almost entirely about young people discovering the force and fighting an evil empire, so things have actually gotten more samey, not less."
PurplePillDebate,fffmmip,t1_fffi8vh,1579887227.0,"Which is the obvious bonus no detractors talk about. If you've never dealt with or at least seen what the most brutal of young women will do when they find a mark, or if they just want to put someone down in some cases, you won't get it. But things can get really bad when they go bad and a lot of women who do shit like that don't realize the effect it can have on men, or else don't care."
