>State and national health officials on Friday announced steps to confront the global spread of a novel coronavirus that emerged in China last month, following the discovery of a second confirmed U.S. infection in Illinois and 63 suspected cases — including two in Minnesota.
The Minnesota Department of Health issued an alert to doctors and other health care providers in the state this week asking them to alert authorities about any patients with respiratory symptoms or fevers who recently traveled in Wuhan, China. The callbacks from doctors resulted in officials sending lab samples from suspect patients for testing by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“While the available information suggests a low immediate health risk for the general public, we consider any new infectious disease a serious concern and we are taking precautions,” the state Health Department said in a statement released Friday morning.
CDC confirmed two cases among travelers returning to Washington state and Illinois from travels in the Wuhan region of China. Testing ruled out infection in 11 suspect cases, and are ongoing in the remaining suspect cases, the CDC reported on Friday.
In the two confirmed U.S. cases, the travelers returned from China before symptoms emerged. CDC officials said that delay could make it hard to catch cases via heightened airport screening as infected travelers return. The CDC advised that no Americans take nonessential travel to Wuhan, and to take appropriate public health precautions such as wearing masks and washing hands while traveling to other regions of China."

I should have dropped his ass then and there. Should never have listened to him. It planted doubts in my mind that what he was saying was true. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend. Literally the worst mistake of my life thus far. I've been trying to get back together with her for the last month and a week. She doesn't want to ever date me again. She just wants to be friends. It's been agonising, not being with her anymore. Like not having oxygen for hazardous amounts of time. I feel empty, lost, and confused about what I want to do with my life. I want to get her back, but I'm losing hope of it ever happening again. Part of the problem is she just got out of an almost decade long abusive marriage. She has trust issues, and I don't fault her for that. Just makes it hard to convince her that I'm serious about wanting to change my ill-mannered behaviour. I understand that it's my fault for breaking up with her in the first place. And in case you were wondering, I'm not friends with the jealous guy anymore."
