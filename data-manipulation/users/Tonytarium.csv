BlackPeopleTwitter,ff9oz8y,t3_esb7k7,1579717648.0,"Y'all should listen to the latest episode of Chris Hayes' podcast ""Why is This Happening?"" On it they discuss the NFL and race and the differences between Labor and Management, how Blacks are kept in positions of labor and how laborers (of any profession) are not expected to share politics or opinion. That is why Kaepernick and Lebron are told to ""shut up and dribble"" when expressing their political opinion."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff9of6o,t1_ff907iz,1579717255.0,"There is still a difference between Labor and Management, never forget that. Doesnt matter if you're a multimillionaire or a slave, if you got other people in charge of you, making your career decisions, you are Labor and you will be treated as such. It's no coincidence that the Coaches and Owners (and fans) are predominantly White even though the players are predominantly Black."

Almost every podcast has ads, and they're usually the same advertisers, Hello Fresh, Meundies, Quip, Ziprecruiter. Seems like a silly complaint for their podcast specifically when its free weekly content and you can easily skip through it, again like most other podcasts."

It's revisionist history to assume leaders must be male. And I agree without ""male"" in the op comment the sentence would have made perfect sense and would have been more accurate for it.

In addition, many Native American tribes taught men and women how to hunt and track, so the assumption that those roles are inherently male is simply incorrect.
