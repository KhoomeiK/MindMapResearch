uAlberta,fdpesm4,t3_emiz41,1578626775.0,You can probably still return it if you haven’t used the code yet.
Edmonton,fdfz0z0,t3_el4pt5,1578374260.0,I’ve done it lol
bipolar,fde4vst,t3_eksrmk,1578331236.0,"Wouldn’t it be nice if once you found your best combo, they could just put all your prescriptions in one pill?"
uAlberta,fcyxtzi,t3_ejmc0q,1578089459.0,"You put in a program change you might be interested in, and it tells you what you need to take to satisfy it! 

It also is helpful in telling you what you need to take for the program you’re already in. I use it when making my schedule (I just put in the program I’m already in) because it’s all the info in one place. It also tells you what won’t count towards your degree if you’re enrolled in it for the upcoming semester. I love it.

So like, basically a straight answer to “what if I wanna switch into _____” it also tells you what courses you’ve already taken that will apply to the program you want to switch into."
uAlberta,fcvno26,t1_fcvehib,1578006016.0,100% agree

bipolar,fcoraa3,t3_ei8a0t,1577839433.0,"20! I also brought myself to the doctor after my worst manic episode. I read my journal from when I was 16-17 a couple weeks ago and I was talking about how I thought I had bipolar. I don’t really even remember thinking that, so that’s crazy hey"
uAlberta,fcok3cz,t3_ei8dnk,1577834223.0,"Personally, I wouldn’t go into 5 if you struggled with 4."
