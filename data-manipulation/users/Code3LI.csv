I lost a lot of attraction to her, not gonna lie. She had a little bit of a belly after and for awhile, as in she didn't TRY to lose it. I've seen other women bounce back with hard work and determination. And she was crazy, which isn't good for a relationship lol.

Anxiety,ffs9kc4,t1_ffs9ajb,1580176466.0,Thank you. I'll take a look into it :)
Anxiety,ffs9815,t3_euy6y8,1580176235.0,"Well, at least you know the issue is, in fact, anxiety. You can work from there. Before I even did medication, which I truly do suggest as it has helped me immensely, I did exposure therapy to myself. Even going to the super market killed me initially, so I stepped back and maybe went for a walk or I'd go out in public that I wasn't in close proximity to anyone like the park (I'd bring my daughter). Then I'd move it up to a super market where's the definitive human interaction but overall within a brief time frame (go in and get maybe two things versus an entire cart, then move up in volume of items bought). Then I'd go to get togethers, small events, etc. Work your way up over time.


But as bad as it feels, know it's anxiety."
Anxiety,ffs8yad,t3_euy90r,1580176052.0,"She probably does it to everyone. Some people just have weak handshakes, of which you may not realize visually by seeing it done to others, but you feel it when you experience it.


Either way, if she does do it to you only (doubt it), that's on them. They're being a bad sport, not you."
Anxiety,ffs8nuu,t3_euxi1b,1580175851.0,"Yes. I've read that the feelings can be a coping mechanism for anxiety. I guess it tries to suppress the anxiety and this causes you to feel this way. So in and of itself it's a symptom of anxiety then.


I've felt it many times before. It has gotten better with medication for sure. But at my last time I'd drive a lot and I'd feel it. I'd feel totally out of it, and that was always the best way I could describe it to my mental health professionals."
Anxiety,ffs8fa9,t1_ffs86bf,1580175685.0,Sorry to hear that. Anxiety can be quite unreasonable at times.
Anxiety,ffs7rex,t3_euy9ur,1580175224.0,"Depending on how you look at it, I'm lucky in that alcohol doesn't really give me anxiety too much. When I have my first drink I'll have anxiety about mixing meds and alcohol, but once I get a buzz I don't care. This is one reason I don't drink too much anymore; that and the massive hangovers that do lead to anxiety for days.


I looked up the Long Island Iced Tea (I've had them before, but didn't know the full ingredient list) and I don't see anything that'd cause massive anxiety. It's not like you were downing a Red Bull and vodka or something. So I think it was all in your head versus the actual alcoholic drinks causing the attack. Still, it feels just as real - I know. 


It could've also been social anxiety if you were in a place full of people such as a bar."
Testosterone,ffntrpn,t1_ffnrq7n,1580070708.0,"Wow. Crazy stuff. TRT helped me with fatigue and sexual issues from antidepressants. Antidepressants helped with MOST of the anxiety. But some manifestations such as dizziness still remain, sadly. Best of luck with TRT :)"
Anxiety,ffex0oe,t1_ffekte9,1579868956.0,"I've never heard of that. But I'll look into it. Thank you.


Edit: it looks like that's usually related to coming off of a ship or airplane. I haven't been on either in a long time."
Anxiety,ffex00r,t1_ffe5b3k,1579868937.0,Exactly. And it isn't all of the time. But when it happens it can be very bad. I had a very bad case yesterday that was around a 9/10 in intensity.
Anxiety,ffe03sj,t1_ffdzw81,1579833251.0,"I've been to many doctors, including an ENT, Gastroenterologist, Endocrinologist, GP, Cardiologist, and more. No one can seem to find a reason.


I am going to vestibular therapy with a physical therapist once a week. A Neurologist I saw recommended it after she ran an MRI and ambulatory EEG.


What do you do for the dizziness?"
Anxiety,ffdszxs,t1_ffdso8q,1579828172.0,"Routine check-up isn't a full cardiac workup. A cardiologist will run an EKG, Holter Monitor, Echocardiogram and Stress Test. Well, mine did.


But talking to a Psych would be very beneficial because it CAN totally be anxiety (not a doctor, but the symptoms of anxiety can align with what you have from what I've read). 


Maybe ask about sliding scale or payment options? I think some doctors will be a little easier on you financially if you explain your situation."
Anxiety,ffdss57,t1_ffdsn6a,1579828014.0,"Benzos are benzodiazapines (probably spelled wrong). They're meds that are fast acting for anxiety. Klonopin, Xanax, and Ativan are common ones. However, they aren't used commonly long term or frequently due to the fact they can become addicting and habit forming."
Anxiety,ffdsj59,t1_ffdrxm4,1579827833.0,"My Psych ran a genetic test to see which meds should work best for me. It's a new type of test so it may cost some out of pocket money. But it was on a sliding scale when I paid for it and it was super cheap. They bill the insurance for whatever they can get as well.


Two is nothing, though. I've been on probably a dozen and a half different meds over the year. Not to discredit your work thus far, but you've only tried the tip of the iceberg thus far. The genetic test can help hone in on the meds that may work best for you.


One last thing that I do is Spravato therapy. It's a newer type of treatment that is meant for treatment resistant depression. I think you've had to have tried at least two meds before and must currently be taking an antidepressant as well (it's meant to be used in conjunction with it). Essentially it's a nasal ketamine spray where you feel a bit out of it, they monitor you, and you leave after a couple hours. Initially it's twice a week for a month and then once a week a month thereafter. After that I think there's boosters you get once every two weeks or whatever... I've been doing once a month for quite some time now since we are working on the dosage and my other meds.


Regardless, you at least have a lot more territory that you can look into. I would also add supplements. Fish oil is supposed to be good for depression. Magnesium is supposed to be good for anxiety (get the right type... I use the Doctors Best brand off of Amazon).


If all else fails, Benzos work like magic as needed. Klonopin was my benzo of choice for awhile. Even just having it on me made me feel much more at ease."
Anxiety,ffdrxkh,t1_ffdrlky,1579827433.0,"Have you been to a doctor yet? I've never passed out before. But I have been to many doctors and specialists. If you haven't already, I'd suggest seeing your GP. The first thing my did was send me to a Cardiologist for a full cardiac workup. Other doctors I've seen: Rheumatologist, Endocrinologist, Acupuncturist, Chiropractor, Psychiatrist, etc.


What has helped the most is antidepressants. I'm currently on Effexor and Vraylar daily. I am also on Spravato therapy once a week for the time being."

Anxiety,ffdqrkx,t1_ffdqlr7,1579826672.0,"Exactly. When I was at my worst it felt like this. One time it got so bad at a family shindig that I had to use the wall to wall through a crowded room... Somehow without making it seem like I needed to. 


I guess my stress is high, which can definitely do it. My sleep is ok. I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. :/"
Anxiety,ffdefrn,t1_ffdebax,1579819148.0,I've tried Googling different terms and stuff. I've seen so many specialists. Nothing else comes up other than what I've been checked for. It stinks. My quality of life has been drastically reduced due to it.

Maybe it's because I feel trapped, as in leaving my seat is generally frowned upon? Either way, I try to think rationally and relax. But I have been there where my anxiety is so bad where I can't even focus on the movie that's on.


What helped me a lot at my worst was keeping a small dose of Klonopin or Xanax with me. Just knowing that I had it on me to take whenever made a huge difference."
Anxiety,ff4rxvt,t3_ern52b,1579570995.0,That was one of my first symptoms. I went to an ENT and they shoved a flashlight tool up my nose and down my throat to check it out. It came back clear. It's quite common.

My job isn't that demanding at all, I have 10 years in (almost), I get paid time off, a decent salary (wish it was more), benefits, etc. 


I try to keep the above in perspective at all times. Even when feeling my worse. And by doing so, I feel things have gotten better, even when I still feel the symptoms daily."

I've had the dizziness for awhile now. I've tried changing meds a few times to ensure it wasn't them. I don't think it is. It has generally gotten better, but I still have worse days at times. The past few, for whatever reason, have been bad."

Anxiety,fdzku90,t3_eng13n,1578791166.0,"Absolutely. Especially on the left side of my chest I'd have super bad tightness that would restrict my breathing. You're not alone.

Anxiety,fdzkhw6,t3_encdbg,1578791086.0,"When my anxiety first started to effect me in a physical capacity, nausea was the FIRST thing to hit me. Even before I knew it was anxiety, my stomach would churn. I had seen so many doctors and even was in the hospital before a doctor mentioned the word ""anxiety"" as being the cause.


With medication things got a lot better. I rarely have nausea, if ever. My anxiety manifests different ways such as dizziness now, but I cope with it as best as possible.


While meds start to kick in, I suggest treating the symptoms. When my stomach hurt, I took emetrol, which is like a syrup that helps with nausea. It helped me a lot. Nausene (may be spelled wrong) helps too."

Partially due to many social  experiences involving alcohol, which I'm trying to stay away from; partially because I lack the energy to get out.

depression,fdk885w,t3_elqwy9,1578498309.0,"I don't know what causes which... But I believe that my anxiety and physical symptoms thereof cause my depression, as it holds me back from doing many things ranging from regular stuff that anyone would enjoy to my dream career.


Every day is like torture. I'm tired, lethargic, dizzy, can't focus, etc. I've tried so many meds, treatments, specialists, etc. I feel like I'm never going to feel like ""me"" again. I mean, I'm a lot better than I've been in the past, that's for sure; but it isn't optimal. I never feel ""good.""


I just increased my medication (Effexor), so hopefully that does the job. I'm also on other meds and Spravato therapy.


Idk why, but this morning was especially tough. I felt like such shit rolling out of bed and driving to work. I could barely keep it together. But here I am, at work. I am proud of myself for grinding out going to work despite not feeling well daily. I have a decent amount of time saved up but want to continue to accrue it, not use it. But the thought of using it is like crack. I just imagined using a sick day today and I felt the tension release so much in my body."
