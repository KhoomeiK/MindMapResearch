WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffydf4l,t1_ffx8q3n,1580343771.0,"Idk if I have pics of her doing that. She passed away 8ish years ago now at the age of 17. So when she was able to do this trick and if we took pics, it’d have been on film and my mom would most likely have them. We called it sitting like a bear."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffwybyz,t3_evlpti,1580313758.0,My jack did the same thing.

Damnthatsinteresting,ff888l5,t1_ff7y98h,1579668845.0,"Seriously! I had to be constantly eating when nursing my son and I still had a hard time not going under 100lbs, I’m normally 115lbs and I was no where near producing as much as her."
coolguides,ff876ko,t3_es09pw,1579667938.0,"So if your looking for say a brain aneurysm, wouldn’t an MRA scan be better than a CT scan even with the dye or whatever they give you?"
specializedtools,ff86jeg,t1_ff866ai,1579667393.0,"They did it at the same time as taking my tonsils out so I wouldn’t know about during, but I didn’t feel any pain in my nose afterwards."
specializedtools,ff85omm,t1_ff83wx4,1579666694.0,I never had to go to the ER for my nosebleeds but I did have to get the vein(s?) cauterized because of how frequent and bad they were.
toptalent,ff6m9gm,t1_ff62qd1,1579630214.0,My friends 2yr daughter bent her collarbone a few months ago. Was super weird.
IRLEasterEggs,fepiemk,t1_feobumr,1579321292.0,Yes!

IDontWorkHereLady,fe8idvm,t1_fe6pqgt,1578926469.0,When my first child was just over a year I had an old man call me disgusting after asking if she was mine.
myfavoritemurder,fe07wt3,t1_fdzux9e,1578805449.0,I want to embroider too but feel the same way. Seems so much more intimidating than cross stitch. I compare it to painting free hand and paint by number.
SherwoodPark,fdehqsf,t3_ekou96,1578339283.0,"I’m about 45km NE of Sherwood and keep telling my husband to cancel our Shaw since our internet, which used to be great, now really sucks and we can’t watch the cable because it’s always so glitchy or just doesn’t work. It’s been months of this now. The only other option we can have though is Telus sat and last time we had it we canceled because we lost our feed constantly."

KeanuBeingAwesome,fd3esfe,t1_fd2ydp3,1578157646.0,He reminds me of Eric Clapton here.
microbork,fcxtqjo,t1_fcxcvaf,1578070293.0,Antlers and bone (no idea about kneecaps) are great but should only be given to dogs with strong teeth. My jack russell LOVED them but my chi/daschund cross broke a tooth from an antler.
