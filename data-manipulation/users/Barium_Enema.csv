I do though meet many people who are willing to do zero while they blame others.   Again, its not a supply issue, its a demand issue and I see few willing to reduce their demand.  

I do agree that corporate power and influence though ARE a major concern especially in jurisdictions where running for office requires mountains of money."

facepalm,ff49ynf,t1_fevq3qj,1579558762.0,Haha - it's a reference from old Bugs Bunny cartoons.  It's an intentional mispronunciation for moron.
facepalm,fevdck1,t1_feu1m78,1579396072.0,LOL - are you serious?  If you are then you probably park like this maroon.
facepalm,fevd8ou,t1_feuerkc,1579396022.0,In will do everything I can to avoid parking beside a bad parker exactly for this reason.
videos,feexs57,t1_feejvnj,1579043540.0,"A couple of thoughts - should people feel compelled to respond to rumors?   IMO, No - that's because they are rumors.  Anyone could start some about you - should you justify their existence by responding?  Plus, just because a guy has sometimes been repugnant doesn't mean that all his accusers are correct and that he is wrong.  I may be an ass, but I am not universally flawed, so everything people might say about me may not be true."
Whatcouldgowrong,feeu47z,t1_fee4nqe,1579041249.0,"IMO, age has little to do with it. I've seen plenty of these cars wreck while driven by young people, too. Training and experience are the big factors.  I'm not sure why people who can pay so  much for a car won't get training and some track time.  At the very least, learn how to do burnouts, etc. in a parking lot rather than the street."

Not wanting to be around the dog variety of choice of dog fighters given its tenacity, violence, strength and size is just good judgement.  Therefore, changing the words are meaningless, but on the other hand, I do find the tone of some commenters here to be eyebrow raising in their hatefulness."

AccidentalComedy,fdhsx8h,t1_fdhp1kx,1578429564.0,"Ok fair enough - sorry if I misunderstood your position.  My issue is that in no way was Iraq war part 2 motivated by humanitarian notions.  Too often we have seen any positivity overwhelmed by negative consequences.  All other things being equal, the death of an American is not any more important than the death of anyone else and too often people just don't get that.  The fallout from this ill-conceived attack has already bore rotten fruit.  I want big brain time, not ego-driven knee-jerk responses."
AccidentalComedy,fdhocgu,t1_fdhn4ow,1578426891.0,"As the greatest aggressor in the region, which lead to countless Iraqi deaths and the creation of ISIS from the resulting power vacuum, I guess you think ""Might is Right"" and that dysfunctional and counter-productive US foreign policy wears the ""White Hat"".  Learn your history of failed foreign policy (such as the US lead overthrow of the legitimate democratic government of Iran in 1953) that continually kills other people and then comes back to bite you in the ass.  I am a big fan of America, but your ""team"" should more often consider keeping it's hands out of other country's business - especially when it is just to distract, make profits or for ""prestige""."

AccidentalComedy,fdhmp6w,t1_fdhl0as,1578425908.0,So he was personally responsible for the embassy attack?  Just wondering how you folks justify an act of war by killing a high-end figure in someone else's country (Iraq)?  Talk about terrorism. How many US figures are responsible for a much higher death toll in countries like IRAQ (very many  - and why the fuck is the US there in the 1st place?) - would you condone a missile attack on them as long as it was done in a third party country?  Especially when it nets such a negative shockwave of reaction.  Keep on creating enemies - it's worked out great so far. /s
holdmyfeedingtube,fdhkv0c,t1_fdh5qr3,1578424792.0,It's pretty obvious that you like making groundless accusations.
AccidentalComedy,fdhko5n,t1_fdfxvjs,1578424676.0,"LOL -  please show us a source for what he was planning.  I guess that's only ok when the guys with the white hats do it, right?"
AccidentalComedy,fdhkgtw,t1_fdhfzm7,1578424553.0,Trump greatly escalated the situation when he unilaterally pulled the US out of the nuclear deal and then hit Iran with punishing sanctions even though Iran was 100% certifying with the tenets of the nuclear deal.  I am puzzled why the US has such a hard-on for Iran when Saudi nationals were responsible for 9/11.

IdiotsOnMotorcycles,fc6y7yz,t1_ew1bb7o,1577492568.0,"As a rider, we know shit like this happens, so in my opinion our lack of great foresight and planning leaves us at fault, though not legal fault, at least 95% of the time.  We need to be better at anticipating and if need be the rider should go slower, leave a bigger gap, get out of a blind spot - basically pretend like they are invisible.  We are the only ones who can ultimately protect ourselves; to leave our safety in the hands of the idiot masses makes us idiots, too."
