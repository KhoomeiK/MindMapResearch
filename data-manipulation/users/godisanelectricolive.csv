Beliefs and rituals were be different from city to city, cult to cult, or even family to family. In Sparta Artemis was a virgin huntress while in Ephesus she was a fertility goddess with many breasts. 

There were loads of contradictory myths about different gods out there but none of them were seen as objectively more correct than another. People just accepted that the same gods could reveal different things to different groups of people. Writers were free to use gods in their works to convey whatever ideas they want, they were basically literary stock characters in a sense.

It was only much later when a diverse selection of myths were codified together into some form of an official canon that we still recognize today. By Ovid's time Roman writers were referencing and satirizing earlier literary classics in the Greco-Roman myth genre like The Odyssey or The Aenid."

A lot of the exotic animals like snakes or peacocks or procupines are actually farmed but the farms probably are also rather unsanitary and inhumane. 

They are more expensive than normal meat too so it's not because people can't find anything better to eat than bat or snake. It's seen by some as a status symbol and more nutritious than domesticated farm animals. There are also folks who are just curious what monkey brains or wolf pups taste like. People are willing to pay a large some money for unusual animals to eat so it's not easy to suppress these markets."

That's obviously the joke. A beer drinking Roman. Ha!"

You don't have a third hand do you?"
worldnews,ffgcyq3,t1_ffgalqk,1579903480.0,"The term ""aboriginal"" is by no means restricted to Australia. It just means indigenous or native. For Peru it just depends on what translation you want to use.

Aboriginal used to be the politically correct term in Canada but now ""Indigenous"" is preferred instead, although the term Aboriginal is still in the Constitution. In the past the terms  ""Aboriginals"" or ""Aborigine"" were also the official English names for the indigenous Malaysians or Taiwanese."
