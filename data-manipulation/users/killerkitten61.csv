cats,ffmywmj,t3_eu9kly,1580060293.0,"It is sometimes challenging to keep my cat an indoor cat because our house has more exits than an apartment would, but it’s worth the struggle to me because I don’t trust letting my black cat roam freely in my area (we have some weirdos and terrible drivers). Just get into a routine with your family and make sure everyone communicates when they come and go, and it will become a habit. Example: my boy loves to dart for the garage door, when someone opens it we first check if he’s there, then whoever’s home watches the door, we don’t even talk about it anymore we just go to our places, all for the cat."
