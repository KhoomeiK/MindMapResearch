I'm not sure which the correct way it goes but I thought it was topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight. I'm curious, do you not see the jump or do you think each interval of time reproduces equal amount of skill?

This is the first time I'm able to vote and so I've been watching everything closely, and it's horrid how biased, irrelevant, and downright rude some of the questions were. In fact, in psychology, the type of questions they used (leading, nay/yay saying, double barreled, etc) would be considered unethical and unable to be used in research.

Why did you say that, 30 years ago?"" and when he answered to their satisfaction, they literally asked Warren ""so what did YOU think of the comment he made 30 years ago?""

They kept trying to start shit between Bernie and Warren with the ""woman can't vote"" accusation and when he answered their extremely irrelevant, biased, and downright rude questions, they fucking asked Warren the same thing. Like what the fuck? Who gives a shit about whether or not someone believes a woman could be president 30 YEARS AGO. Aren't there more pressing and important matters to discuss rather than wasting air time on this bullshit?

niceguys,fdfmwbv,t3_el2m1q,1578365386.0,"His [latest video ](https://youtu.be/oGrlnIispeM) talks about how he sexually abused his dog, but tried making it sound like he was the one abused. He talked about how he and his dog played a ""game"" where they would get under the covers and he'd let the dog mount him, but he was describing it like he was the victim and was all cry-y about it and saying that when people ""bully"" him out in the real world, he ""just thinks about Boaz (the dog) inside of him"".

And his second latest video is him being all maniacally happy that he won custody of a dog, which I have a sick feeling about. I reported both videos and I think that dog is not safe with him considering his previous actions toward animals. What a freak. What's hypocritical is that he used to bully people who had mental health problems.
