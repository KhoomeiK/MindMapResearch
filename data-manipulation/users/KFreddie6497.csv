depression,fdpbsiv,t1_fdpbjrj,1578624690.0,"All I can think to offer a friend going through this is support: just being there for them for whatever they need. Most of everything else I'm thinking is probably very unhealthy advice like ""just push through it""."
depression,fc1rfwu,t1_fc1r8dj,1577327360.0,"I've been trying not to eat my feelings either. The hard part is making sure I still eat. The healthy balance is hard to find. Baking isn't really my thing, and my mother has taken over my kitchen, but what I take from your comment is the advice to find something to occupy myself with and sort of distract from the bad feelings. Good night to you too, and I hope you feel better as well."
depression,fc0p2zv,t1_fc0oq4b,1577296288.0,"Exactly, I think the guilt about feeling like this just adds to the feeling, and there is the danger of it spiralling down. It's nice to have someone to pull you out."
