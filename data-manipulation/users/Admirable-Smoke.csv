tippytaps,fgjus4h,t1_fgjqbn0,1580851793.0,I have one for each of my two cats and they have to stay in sync(feed at the exact same time) otherwise my bigger cat will end up eating all the food if it's not timed right and he will end up fat.  If I tried using only one feeder then of course the big one will end up eating it all.  I keep them pretty separated otherwise the big one will somewhat continuously switch feeders because he wants what the other one has.  I keep a pet cam near the feeders and will occasionally check on them while they eat to make sure they are being fair and everything is working as intended.  The feeders also have batteries so they remain on in power outages which is nice peace of mind when on vacation. I also have a petsafe brand automatic cat box for them so really I just have to refill food once a month or maybe a little longer and swap out the box twice a month.
tippytaps,fgjbmj3,t1_fgjatnu,1580840703.0,I had similar issues but the other way around.  Lol @ your adult cat who let's that happen.  That's adorable.  My auto feeders would sometimes get out of sync somehow and I had to replace one to get them to feed at same time or else the younger cat would yell at me and start messing with things in the kitchen.
tippytaps,fgj573x,t1_fgirvhd,1580837197.0,I feed my cats with automatic feeders for timed portion control and it works well.  It also gets them to stop yelling at me every time I come in a room at certain times of day when they stop expecting me to feed them.

worldnews,fgfk3xc,t1_fgfhmxp,1580740905.0,I am also married with kids.  Obama had a social security payroll cut that was equal to or even more than the tax cut that trump gave.  Only difference is Trumps tax cut was far greater for the super rich.

europe,fg36h7a,t3_ewkyd1,1580472252.0,I wonder if this affects smart watches and small vape pens.   I have a pax 3 that died a few years ago and s3 watch that died about one year ago cuz I just got tired of digging out their little cradles.  So I decided it's easier to just smoke weed and to look at my phone for the time than do all that extra shit.
