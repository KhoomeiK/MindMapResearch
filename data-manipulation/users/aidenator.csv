dataisbeautiful,fdagr6m,t1_fda9s45,1578245924.0,"Being left handed is also a 10% probability. That's not the norm, but it happens so often that it's not some strange anomaly either. Their brains are wired differently whether they like it or not. Why can't being gay be the same idea? Left handers didn't get nutured into it."

Games,fbx4r4x,t1_fbx4jnz,1577169309.0,"Valve has been weird with them, but never has supported them directly.

They originally made them remove the word ""Source"" from ""Black Mesa Source"". But they allowed them to continue the game... Then after the initial free release in 2012, Valve saw that it wasn't a shoddy product and allowed them to charge money for it on Steam. Which is a little weird because they were promising for like 7 years that it would be absolutely free. It's worth the money though and I like supporting them."
