facepalm,fezmbs2,t1_fezlj1t,1579458951.0,Dude I was just joking this was just a post to say look at these white people wearing a shirt that says this thing that does not match the thing. Hahaha. And I went with that this person did not say anything about trump he just showed a few pictures that he found funny so take of that tinfoil hat and relax. Reddit is for fun nobody is here to make fun of you or anyone specific. We make fun of everyone including ourslefs and we are fine with that so if you can't laugh at this stuf get of this subreddit and find a site that does care about  actual politics. I am here for fun and didn't meen to insult you.
