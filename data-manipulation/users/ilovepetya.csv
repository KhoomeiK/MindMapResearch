IWantOut,fem1mcu,t1_feljm77,1579236816.0,"Yes, for the most part. If you plan on returning to the states down the line, this would not be a wise option, as not paying back your loans will destroy your credit rating in the US. It's not like the US government is gonna send Interpol on your ass for not paying back student loans, it will just make your financial life much more difficult should you come back. 

I was in a very similar situation as yours when I was 17/18, I was even homeschooled for part of high school too. I considered studying abroad in Europe (non-EU too) for a long time, before deciding eventually to just go to college in the states. Honestly, while I racked up around 70k in total debt, I don't regret my decision. I found it much easier to craft a good social life, and have a fun college experience in a place where English was the primary language, and things were a little more familiar. In addition, most countries universities do not offer bachelor's degrees in English, and in countries like the Netherlands or Denmark, international student tuition fees can exceed $10,000. 

I'm in the process of obtaining a masters degree in South Korea right now and it's English taught and much cheaper than comparitive programs in the states. As others have mentioned in this thread, most countries offer plenty of masters degrees in English, and even give you a visa for 1-2 years usually to search for a job there. 

It's your decision, and I think it's definitely possible to do your undergraduate abroad, but staying in the states at least temporarily for your bachelor's might have some more subtle benefits. And especially if you plan on living or studying abroad after you graduate, you may not have to worry as much about student loan debt."

college,fe9bljv,t1_fe3a80z,1578936082.0,"How would it consume your life, assuming you're working around 40 hours a week? 8 hours of sleep, 8-9 hours of work, and that leaves you with 7-8 hours of time to do whatever you want. Yes, you have more responsibilities than in high school, but you also have more freedom."
college,fe37oj3,t1_fe2d4d5,1578846750.0,"I don't get it. Didn't you have school and homework in high school? How is that different from college or having a job? You still have plenty of time after work and responsibilities to have new experiences, although maybe not every day."
ApplyingToCollege,fdzm5bd,t1_fdyy8km,1578791581.0,"Oh yeah man, I totally understand, and I agree with you! I thought maybe you were referring to responsibilities in terms of paying rent, and other more ""adult"" responsibilities like that."
ApplyingToCollege,fdyxivt,t1_fdyokyg,1578784577.0,lmao what responsibilities do you have in college that you didn't have in high school?
ApplyingToCollege,fdhflt5,t1_fdhe2fn,1578421616.0,Who says a school with an 87% acceptance rate is a diploma mill? Are you just another salty community college student?
LifeAfterSchool,fczo5qj,t1_fcy4qk2,1578105511.0,"Strongly disagree. A graduate from an ivy league school will most likely have much better paying jobs and more prestigious job offers out of college, compared to a student from an average state school or worse. In addition, I'm almost entirely sure employers would rather hire a graduate from an elite school and work experience, than a graduate from an average school and work experience."

college,fbzhr64,t3_ef3qp3,1577247108.0,You sound like a drag. People drink because it's fun. Do you really think people shouldn't drink past 18/19? Or just never talk about drinking at all? Sad.
