I’m a licensed massage therapist and you wouldn’t believe the legal and financial hoops I have to go thru to prove to the police and the municipality that I’m not a prostitute. 

I am not against prostitution, but it’s very possible there are people there against their will. I think you should offer an anonymous call at the very, very least."

You gave him information that will help him to understand as he grows and possibly save him time wondering if he was the reason his mom left. You’ve also helped him to trust you, which he probably really needs right now and for the rest of his life. His grandmother is hurting for both of you and wants to protect you both. I’m sure she gives good advice, but trust yourself. You’ll make mistakes. Always be honest and you and your son will get thru them together. Good luck OP."
AskReddit,ff551qc,t3_erpak9,1579580439.0,Two weeks ago I threw away all the dishes and silverware that had been in the sink. I just couldn’t stand that no one else ever bothered to clean them.
AmItheAsshole,ff4y92w,t1_ff4toaj,1579575334.0,*slow clap* completely agree.
AmItheAsshole,ff4y4v5,t1_ff4lmq3,1579575254.0,"I agree with you. 3 months and she won’t let him go without her as chaperone? Red flag. 

OP NTA but tho you can decide the terms of this experience you friend might not want to go along and decide to stay home. I’m on your side, but it’s a possibility."
