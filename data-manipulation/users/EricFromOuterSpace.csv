The easiest way to make that clear is just remove the part of the transporter where it appears to vaporize you. Presumably, as Star Trek technology advances, eventually they could scan your body and rebuild you on the distant planet, without vaporizing you. Because of course they aren't ""sending"" your atoms over there — if they could do that they'd just send your whole body intact. They are rebuilding you with available atoms on site. 

OK, if that's the case, then what if the new transporter could just scan you, and then build your copy. Now there are two of you. And then a second later Scotty says ""OK, time to kill you now, you're already on the planet."" Well, what is ""you"" ? Certainly ""you"" that is still standing there like a fool on the transporter station wouldn't want Scotty to shoot you in the face. And ""you"" wouldn't care that someone who looks very similar to you is on that distant planet.

Here, you can read about the design give-aways that lead to this term from the very blog that coined it:

[https://mcmansionhell.com/101](https://mcmansionhell.com/101)

That's a 101 primer on ""what makes a McMansion."" Here is a breakdown based on architectural principles:

I don't doubt many McMansions are built with ""Cheap materials,"" but that isn't what makes it a McMansion. Some McMansions are probably built with the highest grade materials possible, for example. It could cost millions in custom finishes and rare materials. It's still a McMansion."
Houseporn,fdi136k,t1_fdhztye,1578433860.0,"I am currently in the late stages of designing a modernist house. It has a lot of glass and a fair amount of concrete and steel. So this is anecdotal, but  based on my experiences I'd say this house is somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million. Glass and steel, unfortunately, is extremely expensive."
Houseporn,fdhzj21,t1_fd32o6u,1578433024.0,"I don't think you understand what that term means. 

It refers to design, not materials. 

And either way, this would not qualify as a McMansion either per design or per materials."

Definitely a shared aesthetic."
Houseporn,fdhkmk2,t1_fdhiyki,1578424649.0,Honestly it might be my favorite all time.

The idea is that there were many failed Soviet programs that resulted in the deaths of the cosmonauts, and all of this was kept secret by the USSR, but amateur radio enthusiasts of the time recorded their messages. 

From what I read, it's mostly all debunked, but it's really fun to read about."
