shittymoviedetails,fevjv1l,t1_fevhnac,1579398223.0,Russian Ark is my go to example. The cooridination required was insane.

ObscureMedia,fes0x8a,t1_fepuzgz,1579360275.0,don't kink shame me.
boston,ferzltl,t1_ferwow3,1579359926.0,Thanks. I might have missed the subtle humor there.

ShortFilm,feru3a1,t3_eqazb6,1579358348.0,this is pretty damned cool!

ObscureMedia,fe3bkq9,t1_fe2xgfv,1578847798.0,"ehh.. i personally wouldn't have submitted here. I usually think stuff like long lost vhs's or weird ""educational"" films when I think of this sub but....I guess people enjoyed it so what's the harm?"
ObscureMedia,fdogcub,t1_fdlkxm7,1578604591.0,"I forgot people forgot the meaning of ""socialism"" that was used for almost 2 centuries when posting that comment. Apologies."
ObscureMedia,fdl81e6,t1_fdl4zdp,1578518615.0,"That's a weird way to phrase it. I know what you are talking about. And the subsidization and all that nonsense and wasted money are ridiculous.

But if it was just ""socialism"", the actual farmers would own their own farms and equipment etc, and they wouldn't be in debt to corporations who they grow food for under contract. 

I think by ""socialism"" you might have meant ""hugely aggressive and monopolistic capitalist corporations that corrupt government spending""."
hiphopheads,fdk9469,t1_fdgyv7v,1578498876.0,Ok.
ObscureMedia,fdk1kpd,t1_fdk05fj,1578493780.0,"Sometimes entire alliances of farmers in an industry advertise their general product. Back in the 90s dairy farmers in the US did it with a milk campaign (""got milk?"") involving celebrities. There was a pork one, too. ""Pork: the other white meat."""
ObscureMedia,fdk1fal,t1_fdjzn6i,1578493672.0,"I guessed the latter. Much like the ""Got Milk?"" campaign of the USA dairy industry."

YouShouldKnow,fdk0exd,t1_fdjyikl,1578492928.0,"I love how one of the most watched and well funded channels that is in millions of homes doesn't consider itself a a mainstream network. You need to believe in yourself Fox! Your're a flower, you're a rainbow!"

politics,fdjzazx,t1_fdjwt32,1578492067.0,"I like pointing out to these people that hearing ""press 1 for English"" when you call a company IS the company directly responding to the free market. Those people who speak other languages are a big enough demographic that it is worth their time and and money to have such an option."
hiphopheads,fdgoepc,t1_fdg3e61,1578403953.0,"It's January 7th. I've probably only seen like 3 new things yet, personally."

hiphopheads,fdgo6bu,t1_fdf7r7d,1578403755.0,"Everyone is bugging out about dancing cuz they don't seem to know any hip hop history. DJ/MC/Breakdance/Graffiti. I don't like this song or video, but it has nothing to with dancing. In fact, that's the one part I liked."
YouShouldKnow,fdgnfdx,t1_fdgkwau,1578403112.0,We do?
YouShouldKnow,fdgnc5q,t1_fdglguz,1578403034.0,Weird. When I went to school in the 90s I knew not to lean my head back. I mean it even seemed common sense to me to not...you know... bleed down your throat. I thought tilting your head back was one of those dumb old wives' tales that people stopped believing in 60 years ago.
offbeat,fcu9h66,t1_fctw16e,1577975708.0,"It's pretty cool that he left behind an early life of crime and being in a gang to finding a more profitable and positive way to take care of his family. After that, he even went on to start a youth football league for inner city kids and helps a lot of people.

 I also rarely, if ever, have noticed him use the word ""retarded"" twice in one poorly constructed sentence."
