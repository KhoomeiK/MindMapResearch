AskReddit,ffaetgv,t1_ff9tux8,1579734017.0,This is not true. You can leave and come back as you wish as long as you have proof of your flight (boarding pass) to get back through security. If you're traveling internationally you'll need to clear customs and immigration first of course but once you're stamped into the US there's no restrictions on leaving and re-entering the airport.

But man, she is just not in tune with ""fit.""

""Overall, the fit is fine, but it definitely bunches when buttoned, even though it’s my regular size."" If the buttons pull, it doesn't fit! It's not your size!!!! It makes me mental when people comment that something is off with a garment when they can't get into the size that they insist they are.

Clothing reviews like this are largely unhelpful without framing them in terms of the reviewers proportions and measurements. Garment sizing is so arbitrary, especially in fast fashion, that you really have to be descriptive about your starting point for people to use your feedback in a practical way. And we know Emily would never divulge anything other than she has a large bust, and is a size XS.

Also, there's a big difference between suiting blazers and casual blazers. The two sort of serve different purposes, with more structured suiting blazers being fussier for fit and more likely to need a size-up (or even tailoring) than other garments, and casual or tuxedo styles being more flexible. I wish she'd addressed that more clearly.

It’s just my spouse and I, and there’s no way hulk shopping benefits us. We made a one-time large item purchase that justified the cost of a membership but after that, there’s little appeal for a household of two. We can’t store that much, and we found that a lot of the stuff was so oversized that we’d never finish it by the allotted expiration dates (even knowing those are soft dates). Unit prices aren’t better than our local market for the stuff we’d consider buying in bulk, like meat or paper products. We don’t have access to Kirkland booze at “our” Costco and aren’t incentivized enough to drive further to a location that does carry it. They don’t carry the pet products we prefer.

TwoXChromosomes,fez0l0p,t3_eqphay,1579452781.0,"I don’t understand how you can determine you don’t want children for yourself, but be pro-life when it comes to others. Especially when you’re in a sexual relationship and when it’s common knowledge that no form of birth control, short of abstinence, is 100% effective. So either you’re truly ok with possibly having children, or you’re pro-choice. Not pro-life. 

I realize the above is judgmental, and I guess that’s coming from a place where I’m actually more disgusted with pro-lifers who suddenly flip flop when they’re the ones facing hard choices, as opposed to those who are staunchly pro-life and stick to that belief. 

That said, I’m glad for you that the privilege of having choice still exists in this country and I hope that you‘re vocal about the need to keep it that way going forward. And I genuinely hope that you’re doing ok after this experience. It’s hard, no matter what."

The abuse she's received is a thousandfold amplified because of the internet and social media. It's not accurate to say, well, everyone else suffered the same. Maybe the tabloid press *was* just as vicious then as now, but today there are, for one, a lot more gossip/tabloid channels in general and second, each of those have a massive platform with access to vastly larger audiences. 

The nastiness has existed for decades but the current kind of **viral** nastiness simply wasn't at  this magnitude even just fifteen or so years ago. What is happening with Meghan *is* different imo.

blogsnark,fdlhbsw,t1_fdl9m4q,1578524024.0,"And reading the headlines today, it makes me wonder of this is something Harry has wanted for a long time—to live a more private life or at least one out from under the direct control of the family. Marrying a non-British commoner who already had an established life and network outside of the UK gives him a foundation on which to do that. Not saying that’s why he “chose” Meghan but perhaps it was a serendipitous benefit. However, the gossipy part of me wonders if it’s possible for Harry to understand just how deep his privilege runs and what it would be like to have those apron strings cut. Meghan is obv aware of what it’s like to have to work and to earn the things you have, but Harry hasn’t a clue.

The press and the internet have been terrible to them. But I also think that from the beginning it was unlikely going to work for them to remain “Royal” with Meghan being 50% of that partnership. She’s an independent, self-sufficient, American-raised, 21st century woman who made a public name for herself and earned her own income.  Basically, all the qualities that would likely fall in the “avoid” column, when identifying a wife for a prince of a conservative monarchy steeped tradition and privilege. 

To believe she’d just seamlessly suppress a great deal of the day-to-day freedom she previously had to be herself, under all that musty protocol, is kind of bananas to me. Especially given how fairly quickly they went from dating to engaged to married to parents....I don’t see how the enormity of the change she was making could have really sunk in until she’d been immersed in it for a while."

I also think there are a lot of very astute and nuanced observations in this thread about what is “right” with regard to grieving, and what grief looks like when your life and livelihood is based on social media. I don’t have children but just the thought of something happening to my nephew or nieces makes my heart pound. I cannot begin to fathom how a parent survives a situation like this, much less have the presence of mind to follow what strangers believe is proper “grief etiquette.” I’d never heard of her before this thread but I assume she regularly does a lot of “in the moment” posting. So I can understand how she might continue on like that, reflexively, even when in the midst of tragedy. (Though I agree with many others that it’s hard not to side-eye the posed bathroom photo.) I’d guess I’m concerned  that they’re sharing this tragedy very publicly and in real-time because they’re not in a clear frame of mind, and that they might have handled it differently if they could think more objectively. Even if your paycheck comes from sharing your life online, you’d 100% have the right to exclude this from the public for the immediate time being, especially when so many people are consuming the story for entertainment. Id hate for them to feel regret because they’ll already have such a long, hard road to travel in the aftermath."

My reading abilities tested at a high school level in third or fourth grade, and I could read very quickly and retain what I’d read. My teachers actually didn’t believe I was consuming books as quickly as I claimed, so they did impromptu tests with unfamiliar reading material and it turned out I wasn’t lying, LOL. I could read faster than they could. However, as a result and as I got older, I never really developed good study habits because I could read/cram and regurgitate it as needed to pass tests rather than methodically building an understanding of the material. And that approach didn’t work for math, where I always struggled. I really only liked reading for pleasure, not for study, so that also lead to the bad habit of doing as little as possible to get decent, but not excellent, grades.
