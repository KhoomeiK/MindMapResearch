MobileLegendAdventure,ff5bd3q,t1_ff3hymf,1579586083.0,Get in the order this poster says. Rainbow teams aren't great and in the long run you'll want Karrie
LegalAdviceUK,ff5b9us,t1_ff48y71,1579585993.0,But the rocks take up far less space than your neighbors van would. It still seems like this would work well (but I can't see the layout of the area)
LegalAdviceUK,ff5b5jr,t1_ff4glb7,1579585875.0,This is exactly what I would do. Leave the bags there for as long as it takes to get the management company to do something about it in future.

afkarena,fd1h4cy,t3_ejtkf5,1578131313.0,I wonder if they are counting all of the inactive accounts in this. There must be a lot of accounts that people have abandoned which might still be automatically placed at the bottom of the rankings.

MobileLegendAdventure,fcvhmqv,t1_fcv9oi9,1578002274.0,"Only some reset, others are one time purchases. E.g. the legendary items for 6k coins are one-offs. The 8k one does reset. The named heroes reset, the generic frags don't."
MobileLegendAdventure,fctvdw1,t3_eiwczt,1577961493.0,Equally terrible in AFK Arena too. They did have a Christmas event but it required doing almost nothing that needed any thought.

afkarena,fcmwy90,t1_fcmg44j,1577795972.0,"1. Its not really an event. There's nothing to do in it. You just play normally and hope you get enough epics. If there was lots of time to prepare or if it was a regular thing and you could use strategy to save up the required epic summons then I would think it was an event.
2. The rewards are fine but the reward people will want most is the Brutus skin, which is the bit that I think of as a cash grab as that is not easy to get without spending or previous saving of resources.
3. I'm fine with Lilith doing whatever they want with their game. I don't consider this to be a fun ""event"" and I consider it to be a cash grab. It's still free stuff for almost everyone though. Its just really boring. Its not helping me to enjoy the game more. The lack of actual events requiring strategy and clever gameplay is worrying. And the recent Christmas event was more of the same problem."

MobileLegendAdventure,fcmenuj,t1_fcm79e4,1577772495.0,If you are lucky you can get to 1350 without spending money. Getting summon tickets is usually a better choice than the hero offered at 1350 however
MobileLegendAdventure,fcl4wtg,t1_fcku8sd,1577739881.0,"I used to prefer AFK Arena to this game but MLA has overtaken it in terms of features, fun and freebies. Afk arena is just too slow to add new features and they dont have anything like the guild functions of this game. I'm not sure I'd try it now if I were you"
