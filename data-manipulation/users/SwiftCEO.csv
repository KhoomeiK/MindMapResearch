NoStupidQuestions,ffepft8,t1_ffeljub,1579858847.0,Just wanted to add that Starbucks Baristas in SF make $15/hr and it’s not rare for them to quickly get raises. A family friend was making $17/hr.
Workspaces,ffcxndd,t1_ffcpeix,1579809406.0,I have a few friends that have had success with aftermarket chargers that are significantly cheaper.

college,ffbbpu8,t3_esnya0,1579758783.0,"Hi! I was in the exact same situation before I transferred out.  All my friends had left for college and I only saw my gf on weekends. It gets lonely very quickly unfortunately soI just learned to stay busy.  I know it’s easier said than done. 

I started working for ten hours a week at a restaurant,  joined a club on campus, and started working out.  Gradually, I started meeting people in similar situations and made a few friends. On top of that, my grades improved as my mind was more simulated and my time had to be more structured.

Looking back, that period of my life was when I “grew up” the most and really came out of my shell.   It’s tough but worth it!"

CSUS,ff5eouk,t3_erqpdn,1579589663.0,There’s a list of classes that qualify as elective classes. You can find them under your class planner in the student center online.  It should list all the classes that will fulfill the elective requirement. Some classes may even fulfill multiple requirements so be wary when making your choice.

whatisthisthing,fezunhd,t1_feypcbo,1579461878.0,"Having stayed at a few hotels like this, I’ve come up with a theory on why the design choice is becoming so popular. 

I think it’s a way for hotels to limit their water usage.  If a guest is worried about getting the rest of the bathroom wet, they’re more likely to limit the water pressure and take quick showers."
CSUS,feqb5mu,t3_eqe90q,1579339665.0,"Hi! Last semester was my first and it took me a while to figure out a system in order to get a decent parking spot and to avoid the traffic. Warning though, I like to skip traffic so arrive to school early. 

My classes start at 8:30 and I tend to arrive around 7:30 to avoid traffic.  I park in structure 3 on the underground level. I’ve found that there’s usually not a lot of traffic (less accidents) going through there and it’s quicker to get out.  If you arrive around 8, you’ll still be able to get a decent spot but it’ll be in the upper levels.  

Just remember to not park on the edge and I wouldn’t try to fit in the “compact” spots if you have a larger vehicle. I got a nasty scratch on my car this way. People just don’t care.

Leaving around 12:30 to 1:30 may cause you to end up being stuck in traffic just to get out of the parking lot if you park in structure 3 though.  I’ve been stuck for upwards of 30 minutes. Something to keep in mind. 

You shouldn’t get much traffic leaving around 3. Good luck!"
