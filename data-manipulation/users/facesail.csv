depressionregimens,ffcrib9,t3_esuqew,1579805763.0,Hey this is a great idea and if it helps you great.  I think a platform that helps people is great. My biggest issue with all of this is there is so much conflicting information that it causes inaction also setting ground rules of positivity would be good because this can be a toxic bunch. The fact that you’re raising this is great. Pay attention to the words you use about yourself as it’s not helpful to you. Let other help -doing this on your own is not a good practice
depression,ffb07k1,t3_esbfsf,1579748579.0,I was just as bad as you and I recovered. You will too
depressionregimens,ff4mbxs,t3_er7vml,1579567081.0,Look on the website and buy what you need fixed. If you need stress relief take that one. If you have memory issues. Take those. It really helped me. I took twice a day.
depressionregimens,ff3agc6,t3_er7vml,1579537385.0,You need to be doing more than a multivitamin. I would look into the Amen supplements. They moved the needle for me
depressionregimens,ff0wjk0,t3_eqnan1,1579472956.0,Great post fNeezer. Not sure if I accidentally deleted it? First with my post I have omitted much of what I have learned in an effort to not have to write war and piece. So I don’t get into the why.  Second you primarily ask how do you know what works. It’s kind of the reason why I wrote what I did and feel so strongly. First you do know. I Went from living a perfect 10 life to a -35. To now I’m a 6 or7. Had I not did what I did I’d likely still be at a -20. I found psychiatry is a black box. Psychiatrists are able to help you take baby steps when there are treatments that will help you leapfrog. Most depressed people just give up and accept that this is how it’s going to be. I can tell you I am 1-2 rounds of treatment with mushrooms where I’ll be normal again. That’s how you know it works. The other thing you keyed on is how do you know your depressed. You know. And I will also say psychedelics will be a first line some day. They work that well.  They should be first line for minorly depressed people. It just clears things up in ways that meds can’t. I’ll also say I’m into recreational drugs. I don’t even think pot should be legalized. I do think the feds should approve mushrooms for treatment for depression
depressionregimens,feu2oea,t3_eqd7ee,1579382549.0,Read my post yesterday. I forgot to add in exercise/nutrition. Etc. Johns Hopkins protocol- mushrooms. It is the closest thing to a cure. It will put you in a vastly different place in 4 hrs. No bullshit
depression,fesbdmf,t1_fepotw4,1579363475.0,"Precisely! In the 50s the government was successfully treating PTSD with LSD. They shut down the research due to the war on drugs and concerns over abuse. No more research was done until now and the drug industry took off. Had this not occurred you would have your research. One way or another. My tipping point was when I met the person who administered the JH Protocol and he also takes people to South America to do Ayawaska with jungle tribes. He was also depressed for 15 years and this was the only thing that pulled him out. It seems “people” have been treating anxiety and depression for thousands of years successfully. Mourning, trauma and sadness is nothing new. We in the west have a different viewpoint on Psychedelics. To further support this I was told but my psychiatrist. The only one that has been comprehensive. He said Nothing he could give me would be more effective than mushrooms and to continue to microdose. The real reason I take the position I do is because this A/D is horrible.  2) The current scientific research points in every direction and concludes very little. 3) People hold onto all of this inconclusive information and do nothing or give up. When I can tell you from experience what worked for me in the shortest amount of time. I can also tell you the general percentages that it will work for you. If I told you you had an 80% chance of feeling 60%-70% better in 4 hours and you have 0 risk of harm. Would you listen? How hard would you pursue this? The one thing I’m mixed up about. Is how hard to recommend this. I say if you are moderately to severely depressed do JH protocol mushrooms. I really believe that even if you are slightly depressed or struggling a little bit do mushrooms. It works that well. Also to clarify I’m not a recreational drug user. I hate all of this. I don’t want to use anything. Not even multivitamins. Thanks for the post. Hope this helps"

depression,fepn70i,t3_eqbxri,1579324999.0,Appreciate your perspective. I posted this another place and got similar response. I put my title for a couple of reasons mostly because it has allowed me the ability to try just about everything and to figure out what works. I’m also in consulting and I can tell you if my people were consulting like the psychiatrists are and giving advice like I’ve been given we’d be out of business. Everyone points to the research like you did. I can point to for and opposing research that will try to prove/disprove everything on this topic. My personal favorite is the one where the asked psychiatrists if meds worked 1/3 said yes 1/3 said no 1/3 said they do more harm than good. So 2/3 said meds were no good. Studies show that meds are 50/50. This is the dangerous path to only follow. Meds are a part of getting healthy it will just take you years to get there
depression,fepcrz2,t3_eqathg,1579317339.0,Good for you! Never go back. My mom is a 50+ year smoker and not only is she going to die a terrible death from suffocation. But I have deep regrets about not being able to get her to quit. You are so much better off.
depression,feilyd1,t3_ep4bw6,1579141630.0,Hey. You will get out of this. Everything you have said I have felt and I can tell you you will get better. My guess is that you are getting bad advice and doing things the traditional way. Look up my previous post on reddit. Follow the steps. You are unique but you are not that unique. I know may people who have gone through this and claim to me 110% better. Sounds like you need to start with Ketamine.
u_jenn1983,fefwrhs,t1_fe6sekk,1579067740.0,Hey I’m interested. I’m 40 and nice looking. Please PM me if interested
depressionregimens,fdjat8d,t3_ehk1i8,1578463581.0,It should be mandatory. It narrowed down the list of drugs that would work. It’s not perfect but very helpful. People point to studies that say it is flawed. The reality is I can point to a study that contradicts anything you want to bring up. If you are depressed you need to be comprehensive.
depressionregimens,fdjad2s,t3_eja6ki,1578463150.0,Johns Hopkins protocol and mushrooms will fix you. Micro dosing is good too. You need a heroic dose. Mushrooms have worked better than anything else.

DepressionRecovery,fdj0b6d,t3_el3o4k,1578455202.0,Hey you got this. Start with SS and get started. Tell your employer you need to delay your start due to a death in the family. Not sure where you stand on meds but start there get that going. Get functional. Check out my previous post about depression. Put in place a plan to follow the steps I laid out. What you can afford and save up for. Given your situation I would really do only things covered by insurance from your new job to start. Then - This is going to sound crazy but find your way to the Johns Hopkins protocol. The only thing I would add to my previous post is the Johns Hopkins protocol with  psilocybin. this is as close to a cure as there is. In 4 hours under this approach I came down 60% - 70% better and have continued to get better. It is by far the single biggest thing to move the needle. For people with severe anxiety and depression this is the best thing you can do. In three years I guarantee this is widely accepted. Know that others have successfully come out of this that we’re just as bad off. You are unique but not. Just get through this time. You got this.
socialskills,f5z4xk5,t3_dpie3x,1572567258.0,I think most people do this. At least sensitive ones.
