SuicideWatch,ff2ivqd,t3_eqw4e5,1579508117.0,"So that we wouldn't offend the person or other people around us. More if the people around us though. The person who they ""care"" about doesn't give a shot if they say they care. It's just some words. But if the people around them heard, people would get angry, and sad, and ashamed.. I have a friend who has deppression and wants to die.. we both know that we just say that we ""care"" so that it wouldn't get awkward. In reality, we both have bigger problems of our own that we need to solve.
(This is from my view of it, don't hate me)"

SuicideWatch,fefs8jw,t3_en3mit,1579063655.0,"Here is a virtual hug. It isn't much but I hope it helps. I also need hugs from time to time, and if you want some suggestions I would suggest stuffed animals. It is childish, but it help me. Just hugging them relieved stress. The bigger they are, the more you can hug, so I recomend the bigger plushes if affordable."

Dogfree,fectgjz,t1_fecmzsn,1578983953.0,So people know that both tigers and dogs do this but they still think it is sensible to keep a dog as a pet? What is happening to our world. Glad their is this sub and still people who are sane enough to know that dogs are dangerous
