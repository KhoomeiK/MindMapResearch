depression,fcmg4xl,t1_fcmah8d,1577773995.0,Im so sorry to hear that :(
depression,fcm4yqj,t1_fcm48aw,1577764366.0,Thank you so much! Maybe the expectation that i must do something big or something special has to happen on my birthday or else it's not my birthday is really what makes it harder to cope with my birthday after all.  So i guess i'm gonna cut myself some slack and just enjoy the day.

depression,fcm3no8,t1_fclmso4,1577763392.0,"Hi, first of all happy birthday to you :), i hope you have a great birthday with all my heart.Thank you for taking your time to read all of the mess i wrote, it meant a lot to me.  And yeah sometimes i do think that there's something about my luck as if i don't deserve to be liked back, but it is what it is. I know what it's unfair to expect people to like you back just because you have feelings for them, they have their own lives and probably their own crushes as well, so to cope with that and avoid the selfish thoughts i always want the person i like to be happy with whoever he's with and it doesn't matter whether i'm with him or not. Picturing the love of my life being happy always soothes me a bit. Sometimes it feels unfair and hard, but that's just me being impatient and acting like a spoiled little kid who isn't getting what he wants so it's nobody's fault, just me dealing with all my insecurities and emotions haha.

I think dating apps are a great way to meet people. You could give it a try if you get interested in it in the future, maybe you'll end up finding someone there, just don't be so hard and obsessed with it and you'll be fine.

And yeah i'm trying my best to have fun, and replying to all your guys' comments really helps not to care so much about the sad stuff and i really enjoy it.

For the last part, my native language is Vietnamese. I spent the last 2 years teaching myself English as if I'm in love with the language. Everything about it is magical."

depression,fckz3ui,t1_fckuvn4,1577736291.0,"Absolutely not! And I‚Äôd love to know about yours too. Mine is a very silly one but because i was told that nothing is too dumb to be a dream, or a life purpose but it was what motivated me to get better for the last 7 months. I used to long to be in love and able to start a life with my partner being a part of it, there was not a single day went by that I didn‚Äôt dream about having my feeling reciprocated by the person i love at night.

Tldr: i wanted to be loved

It motivated me to improved my english which is not my first language and my drawings skills.  It even prompts me be more confident about my art and i start selling it to make more money.

And I met this very cute guy who works at a coffee shop i used to come all the time. And suddenly he talked to me and then I realized that I‚Äôd developed a crush on him and tbh i never saw it coming .I started to come to that place more often just to see him, we barely talked and because i was somehow intimidated by him i tried my best not to steal a look and pretended i didn‚Äôt care about him, i tried to acted cool and every time i left the place i was always mad at myself for not trying to start a harmless small conversation with him.

I really didn‚Äôt want him to feel awkward or worse, hate me and i figured that it would not be very possible that he liked me back , given that we are both boys and tbh I‚Äôm the only gay kid that i know irl so it just seemed too good to be true so i always avoided him.  i decided that i should try to move on, and it hurt like hell having to force yourself to stop having feelings for a person you like so much.

i went there one last time after two weeks of staying home to see him and quietly read my book and left at 6 so I wouldn‚Äôt miss the bus.  When i was paying he was outside smoking cigarette, the moment i walked out of the shop he saw me and then said ‚Äúbye-bye‚Äù which caught me off guard because he and the rest of the people who work there usually said thank you when i paid my bills and left, but this time when we were alone he said ‚Äúbye bye‚Äù as if were friends. I tried not to overthink and ran to the bus stop without looking back at him because i thought that he might just want to be polite or friendly because there‚Äôs no way he would feel the same, id been coming to the coffee house for months and we never really talked , but that was the best day of my life when he said good bye to me.

The next day i came to see him, he left the moment i arrived so i spent 3 hours there reading my book and then left. And I figured that maybe it‚Äôs only in my head, this whole crush thing and i needed to stop before things got worse and i ruined everything.  

I stopped showing up on weekends and it hurt so bad not being able to see the person you like. And it feels like im seeing my future being faded away before my eyes, passing right through me. 

it‚Äôs been two weeks and it still hurt so bad but right now i‚Äôve given up on the idea to be with him,  now i just hope that he‚Äôll be happy and that‚Äôs all. I barely expect anything for myself anymore because it wouldn‚Äôt matter. It hurt so bad knowing that it‚Äôs impossible for the person you like to like you back but it is what it is. Im gonna be fine.

Wow this is so long and i feel so guilty  to make you read all of this, i know is ridiculous as hell haha. And sorry if this is too hard to read my english is garbage

If you want you could tell me about your story as well! I really wanna hear it :)

And i would like to know when is your birthday as well if it isnt too personal."
depression,fckuaml,t1_fckso0i,1577733340.0,"For me it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve lost my sense of purpose recently and it dragged all the colors i had left out of my life. And without a life purpose it doesn‚Äôt really matter if you‚Äôre living a healthy life or not, it‚Äôs like living on a day that keeps repeating and it won‚Äôt ever change ever.
It‚Äôs no point trying hard to be the best version of you because at the end of the day it wouldn‚Äôt really matter.
 
And it makes you forget how alive you used to feel years ago. Right now i can barely feel like im living at all.

Tbh losing my only life purpose which is the only reason im still holding onto life is the worst thing that happened to me this year. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my identity, my imagination and right now it doesn‚Äôt matter if im having a good life or not. It also makes my birthday become a day i wish never came."
depression,fcksjky,t1_fcks8iv,1577732258.0,Thank you so much! You are really kind and i‚Äôd love to be online friends with you :) And i wish the same thing for you too!
depression,fckrsjg,t1_fckqghq,1577731797.0,Thank you so much ! And I know what you mean. l used to be very fond of choosing people‚Äôs gifts for their birthdays and tbh all i want is to see them being happy on their special day but when it comes to my birthday it just feels like a very rough day i need to survive.
