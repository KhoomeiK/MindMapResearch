AlternateHistory,fe1ywmn,t1_fe16xsl,1578832510.0,"Typically when people refer to Eugenics as a pseudoscience, they are referring not to whether or not it is possible to breed humans one way or another, but the methods for judging human worth based on physiological or genetic factors. Phrenology, for example, was often an element of eugenic thinking. As a modern example, you could look at IQ as something you'd want to breed for. However it's been shown in study after study that IQ has much more to do with economic and social factors than genetics, so you could breed the two people with the highest IQ in the world generation after generation and still end up with some rando who has a higher IQ based solely on those factors.

Critiques of eugenics nowadays, besides the self-explanatory moral repugnance of any such practice, often point out the issue of unintended consequences. Many genes are affected or affect other genes, creating extremely complex networks that are functionally impossible to map out. Sure you could, for example, purposely ""breed out"" the pinky-toe on your foot (for whatever reason) but that missing gene for having a pinky-toe may also influence sweat regulation, or hair growth, or the effectiveness of the mitochondria in the cells of your colon. Then there's the fact that purposely limiting human reproduction necessarily limits genetic expression and bottlenecks the genetic population, making it more susceptible to unforeseeable diseases.

Essentially, based on our current understanding of human genetics, it would be impossible to breed a superhuman, there are simply too many variables. If you were to apply stock breeding techniques, you'd have to have a very specific goal in mind for what you wanted, and the result would likely negatively affect other elements of that person's life. This is fine if you're breeding hens to lay more eggs or sheep to grow more wool or dogs to have a smooshed-in face, but each of those comes with consequences. Domestic chickens become egg bound easily and use up far too much energy to survive in the wild. Sheep who escape captivity become so matted and covered in hair that it effects their mobility and can lead to infection. Pugs have so many issues that it borders on animal cruelty just to have a purebred one. These flaws may be acceptable for an animal, but anything similar in humans would be absolutely unconscionable. As is the whole practice in general.

EDIT: That also doesn't even address the whole race element, which is pure pseudoscience on the face of it."

There are several Greco-Roman characters who were bad, but they were typically one-offs who are punished by the gods. The gods did shitty things but were kind of above reproach.

In Egyptian mythology Set and Apophis are the big bad guys and may be worth looking into."
trashy,fcw698h,t1_fcvvntb,1578018111.0,"A) regularly means not constant. Those people are probably employed, leaving in the morning and arriving late at night, and experiencing all of the smells all around them, only coming back around dinner. It's also possible that those people were only cooking smelly foods every couple days or so. Both scenarios leave plenty of time for the nose to re-sensitize itself to the smell. If they were immersed more regularly or for longer periods of time, I'm sure they would become desensitized.

B) If Indian people themselves choose not to cook Indian food because it smells strong, that's perfectly valid. It does smell strong. I don't think anyone is arguing that. It uses very strong smelling spices that aren't standard in the West. If those Indian people aren't immersed in the smell of Indian food very often they would of course be able to smell it. If they are regularly partaking, then the smell may become much less noticeable.

It could also be some form of social unawareness. Cooking fish to some people may be associated with a delicious meal, and therefore they may like or at least not mind the smell because they associate it with the taste of delicious fish. Other people who eat fish less regularly may find the smell completely abhorrent and extremely strong. That's why socially it's rude to cook fish in a microwave at work; the smell is strong and unpleasant to lots of people. The inevitable people who do cook fish in the microwave just don't consider that smell as bad; it means they're gonna eat a tasty fish after all. Or they may eat fish regularly enough that they don't notice the smell at all. Likewise people with bad hygiene can smell completely awful and have no idea. In fact when Fabreze was invented it sold very poorly because ""their patented odor blocking technology"" merely blocked odors, but did not have any smell of its own. People who could not smell anything wrong in their houses did not notice a change, and stopped using the product. So Fabreze actually had to add smells to its recipe in order to convince people who had gone nose-blind that the spray actually did anything lol.

The point I was trying to make earlier was that strong smells can easily become dulled, regardless of where you are from or your culture, and they're more easily overcome if you become used to the smell from an early age or associate it with good things. :)"

As an  example, my mom bought burger king two days ago. She didn't eat it in her car, but she had it there. I've been visiting her and borrowing her car to get around. I don't eat out very often, so my nose is sensitive to the smell of greasy fast food. the smell of the burgers only dissipated today, lasting two days. Someone who eats greasy food more regularly would be unable to smell it at all. If she were putting burger king in her car every day, it would take a lot of work to get that smell out, or a long time."
