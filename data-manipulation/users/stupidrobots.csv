keto,fek6tue,t3_epltvx,1579193818.0,">Question 1 I used the Keto Calculator to estimate my macros. It says my TDEE is ~2200/day. Other calculators say my TDEE would be 2400-2500/day. Is there any reason for this difference?

You have no idea what your actual TDEE is, and no calculator will tell you a correct number.  They are estimations, and the keto calculator is conservative.

>Question 2In your opinions, do these macros make sense, keeping in mind that I do plan to stay on a 1600/cal diet until I reach a healthy weight. https://imgur.com/a/oZwkz1e

Yeah that looks fine.

>Question 3 I love some carb-heavy foods. I'm Canadian and I adore Poutine, among other things. I can be very diligent/disciplined in limiting what I eat on a normal day-to-day basis, but quite frankly I don't want to go through life without getting to indulge on some of my favourite foods on occasion. Especially if I'm out with friends or family. (lets say, once per month as a benchmark). I understand that carbs will likely knock me out of ketosis, and possibly trigger keto flu. The question here is: What is the effect of switching into and out of Ketosis? Will it get harder or reduce the benefits every time I do so? Or is it just going to make me feel like garbage for a little bit? Essentially, what are the long-term metabolic downsides to cheating? The FAQ says it takes 3-4 weeks to become Keto Adapted... am I going to have to spend a whole month re-adapting every time I cheat?

We all love carbs here, that's why we got fat.  The biggest effect of leaving ketosis for me is hunger returning, followed by bloat and gas, and of course water weight gain.  Ultimately doing keto for weight loss is about reduction of appetite and stabilization of energy levels even with long periods of fasting.  I have also hear of a study where 1 group stayed in ketosis and one group cycled in and out every week and while they lost the same amount of weight in the same time, the people in constant ketosis lost more fat and less muscle.  If fries covered in cheese and gravy are really truly special for you, enjoy them on occasion and recognize that it's a treat and not really food.  Deal with the consequences like an adult and get back on the bus.  You got this.

>Question 4 Once I reach my ideal weight, I would switch to a maintenance, or muscle building calorie intake. At that point I'd very likely want to go back to a non-exclusion diet. Assuming I continue to watch my weight and not over-indulge in carbs what would be the downside to this? Obviously, people do lose weight without doing Keto, so it's possible to maintain a healthy weight without it. Will going on the Keto diet effect my body in such a way that would make it difficult to maintain my weight with a ""normal"" (NOT SAD) diet, assuming I continue to still eat healthy foods and a proper amount of calories?

The downside is that you're playing with fire.  Doing what you do when you got fat once will often make you fat again.  I'm basically where I want to be weight wise and I do keto for reasons other than weight.  I just feel better on it.  I don't limit my calories or count, and I indulge in more treats if they are truly special.  If you don't eat too much you won't get fat, but eating foods that encourage overconsumption in moderation is something that virtually everyone fails at.

>Question 5 Can I still have my protein shake?

If it fits your macros and you enjoy it, sure.  I find protein shakes to be low-satiety though personally.

>Question 6 I'm already losing weight on my current diet, and at a pretty decent pace. I know one thing people tout about Keto is the increased mental acuity and energy. Aside from that, would there be a huge benefit for me doing Keto in the first place, given my propensity for carbs and likelihood to cheat? Putting your admiration for the Keto diet aside, and being objective, do you think I should just stick to my high-protein, low-carb diet instead?

A lot of us arrive at keto because we tried everything else and our insulin resistance or carb addicted nature would not allow anything else to work.  Keto has done more for me than weight loss, however.  It cured my acne, gave me more energy and focus, fixed my libido, stopped my dandruff, eliminated my joint pain, and more.  Even weird stuff I've noticed recently like: I don't get the hiccups anymore.  I won't tell anyone to stop doing what they're doing if it's working but I can say that weight loss is only one part of keto and it's honestly the least interesting part.

>Question 6.5 What would be your answer to question 6 if my weight loss dropped at some point from 2-3lbs/week to 0.5lbs/week?

If what you're doing stops working, change something.  That change may be keto.  Do what you like and good luck to you!"
