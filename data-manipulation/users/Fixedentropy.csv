Music,ffymowz,t3_evxo8g,1580350080.0,"I’m not a fan - I think she’s talented but not my taste, but I can see her appeal. 

She’s non conformist, talented and doing something very different. From what I understand her lyrics are very personal, and not about (excuse my bluntness) money, bitches, drugs or some fanciful Hollywood type life. They are self reflective, about mental health and are far more connective to the fans that she has, all which seem to be diehard fans at that. 

She has a beautiful voice that really doesn’t sound like anything else out there and it’s nice that she works with her brother creating something unique. 

She’s like the Etsy of music, home made and filled with honesty."

But have you considered when?"
TwoXChromosomes,ffunvhk,t1_ffumj9i,1580245895.0,"Even the simple act of not taking it the exact time every day can be enough for someone’s body to reassert itself. 

The pill is not 100% effective and many people get pregnant while on the pill. Which means they clearly ovulated. 

I’m assuming you ended the pill at the end of a pack, cause why waste what you had paid for... at the end of a pack one would get their period. It is also very possible to get pregnant while menstruating. Highly unlikely but it’s happened. 

Being off the pill means you no longer have the false hormones stopping your body from ovulation (in perfect conditions) and your own body will reassert itself in to its regular cycle immediately. 

It’s also why doctors tell you that if you miss some pills or when you first start using BC, to be extra careful and use alternative protection when being sexually active as the active effects can take 2 full cycles to be properly functional in the body (everyone is different clearly) 

Some cycles have early ovulation anywhere between 3-15 days after menstruation. Again, everybody is different. It would be dependant on the length of your full cycle. If it’s a shorter cycle you ovulate earlier as a result. 

It could also be possible that your body is just adjusting to being off of the pill, but there are other ways to discover if you are in fact ovulating - your body raises in temperature slightly - as far as I’m aware there are also kits you can use to measure your hormone levels with too, but I don’t know too much about those or how to obtain one, I just know they exist."

TwoXChromosomes,ffrtzb3,t1_ffrt9wm,1580165779.0,"This. 

Birth control can cause serious havoc on your body in the right circumstances. But having them sore all the time, that’s a red flag for sure. 

The only times that breasts “should” be tender or sore  is a few days prior to the start of your period, if you are pregnant or breast feeding and you need to pump or have a clogged duct. 

I write “should” instead of should because pain/physical discomfort is your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong. 

See your doctor ASAP. And don’t let any doctor bully you in to just taking some painkillers and be done with it. Make sure you’re heard and understood."

books,ffrnmk0,t3_euuuke,1580161788.0,"I used to be like this when I was in elementary school. Grade 3 or 4 ish. For me it was that I hadn’t found a genre that I enjoyed to really follow along with what I was reading and had a hard time paying attention to what I was reading. 

I also feel this way now, as an adult when I have to read a textbook or something that doesn’t follow a story line. 

Or if I try a new author when I get used to someone’s writing style. I had a tough time getting in to Anne Rice, her style is very much like poetry with multiple descriptive layers just to describe a rusty fence. It took me a while to get in to a flow when reading her books. 

What worked for me other than reading things that sparked an interest (horror, sci-fi and fantasy) was taking notes or highlighting passages (if it was my book) when I learned something new, or had a question or thought I picked up on some foreshadowing. 

It also helps me to have a regular reading schedule, right before bed is key for me as reading helps me fall asleep but you’ll have a better shot at remembering what you read after a good nights sleep. There are countless studies that show a nap or a sleep that hits rem sleep assists in boosting your ability to remember things that you have learned. 

It also helps to have a friend to read with, I have a friend who enjoys the same content as I do and we read a chapter and have a Skype chat about what we read, and discuss what we think is happening next. 

Maybe try shorter stories vs novels - it might take some time to learn to visualize and remember. A short story will help you flex those “muscles” so to speak. A lot of genres have short story compilations or award winning short stories for you to start with."
dogs,ffrdgas,t1_ffrcuzu,1580155816.0,"This! Excellent advice. 

You want to be kind and polite cause you’re a decent human. But you have the right to set boundaries for yourself and your dog. 

I hate it when I ask people to not pet my dog because she gets too excited and I’m training her to be more relaxed with strangers (especially in elevators) people argue or say “no it’s ok” when I’ve tried to set a boundary for my dog. No it’s not ok, I just said it wasn’t and that won’t change because you want it too. Your dog isn’t community property."
rant,ffqwv32,t1_ffqvhw2,1580145458.0,"People are far to selfish as a species to “help the world” when they could help themselves instead. We think in such limited capacities in many different ways. 

It’s broken logic of course, helping the world ensures that you can continue to help yourself (in terms of climate or our ability to thrive on this planet in the future.) 

Our limited perspective (because of our limited time here) prevents us from seeing the big picture or the scale of what’s to come after we are gone. And frankly lots of people don’t care what happens after their gone or they don’t actually believe that anything bad will happen to the planet, it’s been here for billions of years, it will be here for billions to come. 

I agree with your statement, but lots of people with privilege, might not see the privilege based on the frame of reference of said privilege. 

If you have a roof over your head and aren’t worried about where your next meal is coming from, to many that’s privilege, and that’s not even touching in racial or gender inequality, or a list of other privileges that would fill volumes of books. 

It’s such a vast scope to put all in to one little box called “privilege” 

Not wanting to be involved with politics can mean so much more than a lack of understanding in terms of being privileged. For many people, politics is just a bunch of useless rhetoric or a group of people that they wish to avoid cause let’s face it - regardless of where you live the political landscape is a disaster ripe with liars, thieves, opportunistic scumbags. Granted there are some people trying to create real change, but they are fewer than those who abuse policies that were created to fill pockets and not to support anyone or anything except self interest."

Hamilton,ff6rs9g,t1_ff6ovqw,1579633530.0,"The generational groups may be contested by various sources, however 1995 is the most agreed upon end date for the millennial or gen y population. 

The biggest determining factor isn’t always just the date but the similar characteristics (preferences, values and social behaviours) exhibited by a group of individuals born and raised around the same time. 

Where people are more than just their generational label - the things that influence specific ages tend to differ immensely. Those clues become apparent when viewed at a distance and in larger groups overall.

The things that effect a millennial are different than what a gen z faces, they are at very different points in their lives, and their parents also (typically but not solidly come from different generations) eg. Most millennials parents are boomers, and most gen z have parents who were members of gen x. 

The reasons there are differing age ranges is twofold - just to be over simplified for understanding sake. 

People who talk about generations have reached different conclusions— a lot of people don’t do actual research, so they’re just guessing. Or sometimes trying to be a little bit different in comparison to a different outlet, almost as if they are sharing “new information” to appear relevant in the conversation. 

Generational birth years can vary by geography, just as you’ll see varying characteristics in different parts of the world, they have different things influencing their behaviours, ideals and primary goals. 

Someone who is currently 24 doesn’t have the same ideals as someone who is 38 - they had different generational role models and ultimately grew up in very different worlds even if they are from the same city. That 24 year old is much more gen z than gen y in their ideals and behaviours."
Hamilton,ff6lgp9,t1_ff6kqes,1579629725.0,"Various outlets have varying date ranges between generations - some sources claim gen y or millennials start in 1980 where others claim anywhere between 1980-1985 ending between 1995-1998.

There will always be an overlap in generational date ranges and a mixed opinion when posting down a start and end age range."

history,ff4zq8i,t3_erhy4k,1579576385.0,"History is very subjective. Yes there are facts, but history is written by people who have opinions and history tends to be written by those with power. They don’t typically write about themselves in a poor light. 

We didn’t have the types of sources that we have now for what will be considered history in the future, social media, images, posting in real time etc. 

It would be dependant on whether those in charge, currently or in the future purge records for a purpose of hiding facts, changing the narrative etc. but getting rid of it all along with the collective memory of stories being passed down... still some bias no matter what. 

Even the reader has their own bias as to what they think about what history they are reading and how they will talk about what they read, in favour or against. Those opinions based on that persons influence should they have any can change opinions who don’t take the time to read the first or second hand source and they stick with the here say opinions. 

We also have a tendency to fill in the blanks and substitute information we don’t know with assumptions based on our limited understanding of any given topic. We in general don’t like to tell people we don’t know something."
