I held a driver's license here for 10 years and they fought me on me having a copy of my Certificate of Birth Abroad (which they told me was fine), despite them having scanned in my old one and having it in the system, and me having had my license here before and I still had to wait because the person at the counter decided it wouldn't work.

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffubt23,t1_ffu10lb,1580238671.0,"I did 15 months in a maximum security Juvenile Correctional Center for violent and sexual offenders. Interestingly, most people in the VADJJ have what's called an indeterminate sentence, where you're sentenced to ""a period not to exceed 7 years or until 20 and 6 months"", and you're given your Length of Stay at the Reception and Diagnostic Center. 

But because of how it's structured, they can extend your sentence at any point without going back to court. You aren't allowed to leave within 30 days of a minor charge (i.e. fighting on the unit) or 90 days of a major charge (fighting in DCE), so dudes with Juvenile Life, or judge time, or pending adult time would play something called the ""Setback Game"" where people would swing on you every time you got close to getting out because you'd probably catch a charge, as well.

And since facility rules were set up, a dickbag CO could find any reason to write you up and fuck you over.

I've also been to big boy prison and it was nowhere near as bad. There was a several month period where I'd get in a fight, go to lock for 24, get out and go back to the pod, get in another fight within a couple hours, go back to lock, rinse repeat. In VADOC, I just chilled."
