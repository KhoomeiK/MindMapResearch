Again, the North invaded the South in a war of conquest and the international community rightfully came to the Souths defense. 

And of course the South has more support, the North has closed itself off from the world and is the most brutal and oppressive nation on the planet.So much for self determination."

Yes South Korea was a dictatorship that killed thousands but the North was too and did the same. And would you really want a United Korea under the Kim family because thats what would have happened had the US and dozens of other nations not intervened. It was a UN operation to push back an invading force. Whether the decision to then invade the North was moral is another topic but the war itself was justified."
