I don't know how I'll ever get my self esteem back. I feel guilty for even talking to people now."
halo,fdcbmvg,t1_fd9wwwv,1578271056.0,"This is a beautiful comment for this heartwarming situation, hit me in the soul.

My brother and I grew up on Halo. He's a lot older than me, has a son now. Left me his Xbox when he went to war when I was a kid and we played Halo 3 from all over the world. It was the only relationship I had with him for years and years

When he came back and I was an adult we just haven't quite gotten along. It's been 5 years now and we only talk for family stuff. We can't just hang out or anything. I'd kill for him to want to jump on Halo Reach once in a while now that it's on PC. Just stick our headsets on and be brothers and kids again for a little while every now and then. I'm really lonely these days. But he has no time to do so or interest in doing so. 

I don't know why I'm posting this here. I guess that Spartans never die comment just hit me hard and I have noone to say this stuff to. Had to get it out

I'm really happy for you OP. Treasure these memories forever!

Keep taking the fight to the Covenant. Always!"

Unfortunately I dont really have friends to chat with these days, but that'll come with time.

Tomorrow I'll start my day with a run. I haven't ran in a long time, will try to build back up and yeah, I'll start with reading. Hobbies are expensive lol. 

I am terrible at cooking, will find a subreddit to help with that. I don't know why I struggle with just picking a routine, this kind of guidance is really helpful. I've been a total waster for years."

GetMotivated,fckxi2r,t1_fcj0xkz,1577735306.0,"The more you go out the better it gets. The other dude is 100% right, go outside with purpose. Running is mega uncomfortable for a while and it becomes the best thing ever but you gotta power through. If it's not your thing find an outdoor club for something in your city

Sit outside at the bar or at lunch and stuff. Spend some time meditating or something outside when you're not really thinking about being out there

And take your time with it. Be patient. You'll adjust and be happy with yourself but don't put too much pressure on instantly becoming an outdoor person"
GetMotivated,fckxagw,t3_ehdy5f,1577735178.0,"I'm looking to try and establish a healthy routine. I feel like I'm just trying random healthy ish things both for my body and mental health but it's disorganized

Those of you who are happy with your routine, what's it like? A typical, good, healthy productive day?"
GetMotivated,fckx6tt,t1_fck4odj,1577735115.0,"Daniel Sloss' 'Jigsaw' on Netflix helped me a LOT when I was suddenly abandoned by a partner of 5 years recently

I'm still trying to figure out how to be better, and that other guy is right about moping. Feel your feelings, get it out there, but try not to sit around. Other human interaction will probably be the greatest thing that will help imo

Stay strong. I believe in you. And you will come to believe in you a lot more too!"

Halfway through I met who I thought would be the girl of my dreams but she left after 5 years out of nowhere. 

Wish I could go back to 2014 and not waste my time. 2020s will be better, I hope"
