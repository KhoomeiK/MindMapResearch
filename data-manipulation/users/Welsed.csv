TikTokCringe,ffdp9hl,t1_ffdoxyq,1579825727.0,"No. You miss the point. ThIs particular COMMENT THREAD and subsequent discussion DOES. Again, do try to keep up."
TikTokCringe,ffdouz6,t1_ffdnx1w,1579825474.0,"We’re talking racial oppression in the US. Not historically irrelevant oppression EVERYWHERE BUT. Jeez, stay on topic. lol You need a study guide? You need to make flash cards? Tutor? Its ok, we’ll wait for you to catch up."
TikTokCringe,ffdogdm,t1_ffdlxdc,1579825219.0,"I mean, inherently, when it comes to this context of being able to tell racially charged or motivated jokes, yeah, they do have it hard. Take for instance Jo Koy. His bit about different asian voices is so spot on and hilarious. My filipino gf identifies with it and laughs her ass off. When mexican comedians talk about mexican life, i laugh my ass off because im mexican. I relate. I wouldnt do that if a white person said those same jokes, even tho theyre funny. Actually, i might, if the joke was good. But that is the pt. They have it tough when it comes to racial humor, delivering and being the punchline. Which sucks, to a degree. But that is what being a descendent of historical oppressors gets you.m, unfortunately."
TikTokCringe,ffdleyu,t1_ffdjmff,1579823365.0,"To a degree. That’s the downside of white privilege. Then again, as a fan of comedy, I think every race should be made fun of, especially if the humor is good. White people just have it hard in America because history isn’t on their side."
TikTokCringe,ffdfraf,t3_esy1rs,1579819942.0,Yup. Thats what systemic oppression gets you.
