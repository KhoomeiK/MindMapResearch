Bill Shorten was actually a far better option however the media here in Australia is dominated by Rupert Murdoch's right wing sources, who effectively ruined Bill Shorten's campaign."

nba,fe5xke0,t3_enq7h3,1578877179.0,"I think  that it only feels weird because they were expected to be an extremely talented and cohesive defensive unit with players like Kawhi, PG and Beverly. Instead they have been winning games by being great on the offensive end and have been letting opponents like the Knicks score 132 on them and the Grizzlies score 140 on them, both on their home court too."

worldnews,fe5wlzd,t1_fe5dl24,1578876578.0,"Extremely sad. The worst part about it is Scott Morrison HAS done something about it. He cut funding for the fire services, drained the waterways in Australia and allowed LNP cotton farmers to steal water in massive quantities. He then AS THE FIRES WERE BURNING decided to go on an unplanned trip to a luxury vacation in Hawaii. Then as word of it got out and he was rightfully scrutinised, he said he would come back to Australia and fire affected communities. Then arrived late from when he said he would arrive, then attempting to forcibly shake people's hands for a photo op. As the people seemed to be visibly upset and angered by his presence he decided it would be best to turn his back and head off in his BMW.

So Scott Morrison HAS done many things, all of them bad things."

nba,fe0koug,t3_enk0sl,1578815109.0,"Well lets assume LeBron won in the 2009-10 season with the cavs so he wouldn't rejoin the cavs. LeBron joins and the warriors would win the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons easily. Kevin Durant then still joins in 2016 off season and having LeBron at the helm of the side he would likely trade Draymond for the center they would badly need at that point. The center they would get would be none other than DeMarcus Cousins likely as he was quite sick of Sacramento and the fact that the Sacramento front office would likely trade DeMarcus for Draymond considering they wouldn't win in this warriors era anyway so then they would get draymond in prime and some 1st rounders or Iggy to rebuild with a future young core.

The From the 2016-17 season to the 2018-19 season the Golden State Warriors would boast a lineup of

G - Steph Curry

G - Klay Thompson

F - Kevin Durant

F - LeBron James

C - DeMarcus Cousins (prime)

This means the side would have not only the best player in the league, they would have the best, 2nd best, 3rd best players in the league whilst also having the best center in the league whilst having a 5/5 all star starting lineup.

They would undoubtedly win all 5 seasons from 2014-15 to 2018-19 whilst breaking records everywhere and likely sweeping the entire PLAYOFFS multiple years straight. I would assume the team would disband in the 2019 off season with LeBron going to the LA Lakers like he did in our timeline and he would do it with his great friends KD and AD likely winning many more championships in the purple and gold.

LeBron would probably end with something like 11 rings after going to the finals for literally the entire 2010's and a bit of the 2020's, 8 or 9 FMVPs and would likely still post all time career stat highs and would likely be known unanimously as the GOAT."
