stepparents,ffe4bow,t3_eswddi,1579836345.0,Congratulations on the victory for your SD. It is incredibly sad how adults abuse children to get back at the other parent.

AskReddit,fcvvpxg,t3_ej6wrz,1578011175.0,Not a lawyer but had an attorney argued that a filing should be void because it wasn't double spaced and that was required. It was thrown out. He didn't have to argue the merits of the case which made it easier.

AskReddit,fcu0y6d,t1_fcu0uem,1577968785.0,Depends on the person. Sometimes it is tragic to see how sick a person can get. But other times it is annoying that the person seems to enjoy being sick. But I deal with a lot of people.

AmItheAsshole,fcsofcg,t3_eiphwd,1577921066.0,NTA he isn't always right and needs to stop acting like he is; no one likes a know it all.
AmItheAsshole,fcso8wi,t3_eipi0z,1577920943.0,ESH he was acting like a toddler. He asked to play and you said no and asking over and over again is ridiculous.  But you could have handled it better.
AmItheAsshole,fcbkm4x,t3_eh0ev7,1577587959.0,NTA She has very little trust if she is going through your phone. And poor boundaries to involve her mom. She needs to own that she violated your trust.
stepparents,fc7k8j6,t1_fc7jvc4,1577510105.0,"That her child ""falls"" and is a bettter response than the real reason is bs. Seems that this child is falling so much she is not attentive."
stepparents,fc7igvn,t1_fc7iblq,1577508445.0,It is disturbing she would be okay saying her child fell. That is weird.
stepparents,fc6lojk,t1_fc6ky84,1577483519.0,I deal with teens with anger issues. So many kids who are good kids most of the time will get out of control when they do not get thier way. He is young enough that this behavior can be controlled. You do not want to deal with an anger strong big 15yo boy. Children have poor impulse control and things can get out of hand easily.
stepparents,fc6ld98,t3_eg9caq,1577483308.0,The part that is concerning is that she has a carpet burn for about a week. The masturbation isn't the issue but the lack of supervision at her mom's.  You need to take photos of the injury each time it happens and sent the pictures to her mom asking what happened and if it could be prevented as it is painful to SD. The documenting is important as you may need to encourage her mom to prevent this injury. Unfortunately you may need to threaten court to get her mom to pay attention.
stepparents,fc6k776,t1_fc6jqci,1577482533.0,The guilt will cause this child to grow up entitled. He may be a good kid but if he is allowed to manipulate people his behavior is likely to escalate with age.
stepparents,fc6hf50,t3_eggbm0,1577480643.0,Hell no! She doesn't live there but she is acting like the lady of the house. You are not friends. Contact her in writing that she is not allowed in the house without an invitation each time she will be coming into the home. It is your home and place of business also and having her waltz in is unacceptable.
stepparents,fc6gp38,t3_eggiln,1577480159.0,You need to have a serious conversation with your husband. He can not sit back and let other children be hurt and bullied by his kid. Before getting married did he treat SS differently?  Does he feel guilty and allows this behavior to not deal with his son bring angry with him? He is 9 but what will happen when he is 15? I have witnessed violent behavior because the child continues to escalate when challenged.  It is time to have a united front when dealing with SS behavior.
JUSTNOMIL,fbv4x7f,t3_eekrnr,1577125504.0,Start using a back up birth control method. This type if behavior happens more often than people think. It is messed up to get someone pregnant against their will.
