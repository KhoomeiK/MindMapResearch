You have to remember everyone in the villa was constantly repeating ""she's a really nice girl"" re: the Connagh situation, and they live with her 24/7, so think they're probably gonna be a good judge of character?"
LoveIslandTV,ffltlbr,t3_eu1v84,1580043971.0,"Amy was hated and got death threats from some very pathetic individuals. Her criticisms of Lucie turned out to be fairly accurate though as Lucie spent most of her time on the show spurning the girls and following one bloke around while telling her partner that it was all innocent (it wasn't lol). The only girl she ever really got along with was Maura, they teamed up for a cringey double dumping where they both acted about six years old. I prefer Amy over Lucie, Lucie is ""I only really hang around with boys, although yeah I shag most of my boy mates but who doesn't?"" whereas you can't really help but feel for Amy through her journey in the villa. Although, that's just me."

Shaughna and Callum seem absolutely fine. And as for Connor, I think Sophie is handling that situation perfectly. She outright called him out on being sensitive and says it's okay if he needs to ask her for reassurance. She understands he is motivated by insecurity, I wish everyone else could have a bit of understanding before they go straight in with the harsh criticism of him."

She was definitely a bit OTT about Nas but we don't know how much he was sticking it on her. When you see the clip in context it's not like she is actually deluded enough to believe she is the one making the choice to chuck him. It's more like she is just affirming her self-worth and self-esteem the ways girls do when they get dumped, like ""well whatever he wasn't that great anyway, plenty more fish in the sea"".

I totally get that she can come across as a bit of a princess but I hope we don't go in on her too much. Ol quirky Fudge has graced us with some great moments, let's not forget :)"

Maybe this is a leftover from his police days and having to put up a barrier of sorts when dealing with the public in his role? Whatever it is, I think Leanne can maybe sense this and it's stopping her from getting fully close to him - because there is no 'real him' for her to get close to?

Or maybe Leanne is just not feeling it for other reasons. Either way it'll be interesting to see what happens!"

It is highly likely they will want to get you into weekly counselling as soon as possible and possibly start you on a low dose of antidepressants to help manage the symptoms of your anxiety.

When I was 17/18 social anxiety suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, I went from being relatively confident to being gripped with self-consciousness. Like I remember I could barely EAT in front of people anymore, like the actual acts of chewing and biting and swallowing were like laden with anxiety, that people were looking at me. It came out of nowhere and really affected my life. But I read and worked through THE BEST book. It has a bunch of exercises to do that all use CBT to challenge your inner negative thoughts and beliefs. The author talks about identifying your ""bottom line"", like the root cause of your negative self-esteem, the ""facts"" that we ""know"" that aren't really facts at all, like ""I'm boring"" or ""I'm unlikeable"" etc. It helps you step out of your comfort zone in the best way possible, asking you to really think about the worst case scenarios of putting yourself out there, and using CBT to back it up. I can't rate this book enough, honestly.

You CAN do this. You are smart, you are talented, and you have already achieved so much to get into this uni and move to a new city by yourself. If you can, I would really really try to check out some social clubs, because they truly do have clubs for everything. My uni (Keele) had a fucking Quiddich team man. No matter how niche your interest, there is a club for you. Don't compare yourself to others; there will always be people doing better than us, and always those doing worse than us. But start with your doctor and getting on the waiting list for counselling. Once you are seeing a counsellor they can vouch for how well you are doing and advocate things like giving you extended time limits to submit essays, deferring, repeating a year etc. The uni do want to help and support you and will not kick you out before offering lots of ways to help you, I promise.

One conversation has just organically died out from both sides, we are not going to be lifelong friends but we had some nice chats - that is fine! But one conversation I just got suddenly ghosted. We were writing long-ass messages to each other and then nothing. Initially you feel bad and sort of blame yourself, but then you realise the other person is just being rude and it's not your fault - plenty of other people want to talk to me, after all. But it could have literally been ended politely with a simple, throwaway line, like ""Hey it's been nice chatting to you but I'm getting kinda busy with school/ work/ whatever and might not be able to reply so much anymore."" Or hey, be radical and be honest! ""It's been nice chatting but I feel like I'm kind of running out of things to say to you, but I don't want to be rude and just ignore you"".

I firmly believe that people can improve their social skills. Nothing is set in stone - even the 'big five' personality traits can change over life.

Are you in therapy now? If you are in any way able to afford seeing a therapist (they don't all suck!) on a regular basis, I would consider this the best investment you could make in yourself and your mental health. Your childhood and abusive parents have left you with low self-esteem, and you need to work on how you see yourself and write a new story. I'm so sorry you had the upbringing you did, and it may feel as though you are scarred for life, but I promise you that with the right tools, you can change and grow and truly learn to love yourself.

About 15 years ago I read this and it helped me a lot:  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Shyness-Gillian/dp/1849010005](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Shyness-Gillian/dp/1849010005). She talks a lot about your 'bottom line' and working out what that is: why do I feel so inadequate and how can I start to see myself in another way? It's useful because the CBT uses an evidence-based approach and encourages you to challenge things you 'know' about yourself, like a person who 'knows' they are boring is invited to see the situation from other perspectives, etc. I am not explaining this too well ha but CBT in general is a wonder tool, being willing to consider the evidence and put in the work to change assumptions about yourself. A lot of it does involve doing things that put you a little bit outside of your comfort zone, but that is the beauty of it. The more practice you get at conversations, etc, the better you become. It also helps you to face worst case scenarios: e.g. I want to ask a girl out but it could go terribly wrong. So, say you ask a girl out and it goes terribly wrong. You have just faced your worst case scenario! She gave you a weird look and walked off! But you are alive and better for having done it! You didn't die, she didn't kick you in the balls, you didn't vomit in her face. Things get easier with practice.

Some people's skills lie in social intelligence and awareness, others don't. It is not at all uncommon to meet people who don't take to the rhythm of social interaction as well as others. People generally accept this and make allowances for it. I personally think you are harder on yourself than anyone else is going to be, dude, and that is a real shame because you seem like a nice guy with a lot to offer as a friend."

You are a smart, independent, talented young woman: keep reminding yourself of that. I don't know why people think it's okay to talk to you this way.

Politely but firmly is the key, if this happened to me I would go wild lol which is probably not the best reaction either.

I think your recovery is the most important thing. Your body is craving dairy, which to me suggests a deficiency in something, possibly calcium or B12. I do not think you should feel bad if you seek out the most ethical dairy products possible in order to get your body back to optimal state. Your situation is an unique one, you have just been discharged from hospital after all. Going forward, you could bump up your supplements with a view to cutting out dairy again if that was what you felt you wanted to do.
