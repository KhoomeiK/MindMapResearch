todayilearned,ffh84p6,t1_fffzzpb,1579925824.0,"Historians spill rivers of ink and, I presume, get into scores of street fights arguing over questions like that. You could spend a lifetime trying to study the reasons why Europe, seeming so puny in the first half of the Second Millennium, would grow to conquer the world in the latter half, but at the end of the day we just don't know. We only have 1 history of the world, thus any attempt to separate out the crucial factors for Europe's advancement from the mere incidental details is always going to run into enormous difficulties."
todayilearned,ffg71j7,t1_ffg56bh,1579899840.0,"Uh, no? The Humanists of the Italian Renaissance of the 15th Century propagated the term ""Dark Ages"" to refer to all of the history that separated them from the ""Fall of Rome"" in the 5th Century. It was part of a conscious rejection of the trends they saw as dominant in the society they lived in, in favour of values and ideas they perceived as belonging to the ""lost"" Roman tradition. They had set up a brand new organisation of the history of the world for their own purposes, we are under no obligation at all of thinking along their structure, certainly not when the field of history today is far more sophisticated, more analytical, and integrating of incomparably more information than was capable of the 15th Century Humanists. Imagine scientists today going ""Well, the question of whether or not atoms exist has been a source of vigorous debate for thousands of years, with many arguments coming from both 'For' and 'Against' camps across that time, so we see no reason why we should rule that atoms definitely do exist just because this Albert chap wrote some paper a century ago claiming that they do."""
todayilearned,ffg52uy,t1_ffg30me,1579898633.0,"Newtonian physics is just as ""bunkum"" as the Theory of Humours is ever since it was superseded by Einstein, but we would hardly say that the conclusions it reaches are ""meaningless"". The fact that it's obsolete doesn't take away from how it can at least approximate the Universe better than a completely wild guess, at least make predictions well enough to serve some practical uses. The same basic principle applies to medicine as Rhazes had understood it, even if it doesn't quite meet the same balance between accuracy and simplicity of application as Newtonian physics does."
todayilearned,ffg2zrj,t1_fffcjwk,1579897347.0,"The rate of witch-burning in the Middle Ages is actually surprisingly low (at least given the popular connotations of ""Medieval""). The general doctrine of the Church across the period 500-1500 CE regarding witches was that they *aren't* real, that at their worst they are simply con artists and confidence tricksters who couldn't lay a finger on any soul protected by God no matter how much they wanted to - troublemakers, but not really guilty of anything that warrants execution. The Witch Finders of the 16th and 17th Centuries really had to work to convince common folk that witches had any kind of supernatural power, and even at the height of their power neither the masses or the intellegensia were very credulous."

And, while stating ""Western Europe went through a process of social and economic simplification after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire"" is pretty non-controversial among historians, ""living in their own shit"" is probably too unkind to them, particularly after the first few centuries after the Roman era ended. For one, people are people regardless of the period they lived in, you don't need to know about Germ Theory to instinctively get ""Washing regularly = Good"" and ""Human Faeces = Bad"", and only a few people would've lived in the kind of densities which would've seriously threatened to tax the local freshwater supply. And for another, the Middle Ages saw innovations in Western Europe that the Romans never saw, from the heavy plough and three field rotation to the blast furnace and mechanical clocks."

todayilearned,fffyb8x,t1_fffh3wi,1579894461.0,"Many Medieval Islamic scholars are known in the West by Latinised names, due to the bodies of commentary that Christian scholars created around their works, the Crusades only serving to increase and regularise contact between Christian and Muslim intellectual worlds. It's a bit like how everybody today refers to Gaius Julius Caesar by dropping the ""Gaius"", pronouncing the ""J"", and saying ""see-sore"" rather than ""kuy-sahr"", and how his great rival was ""Pompey"" rather than Pompeius and his lackey was ""Mark Antony"" rather than ""Marcus Antonius"" - at some point they started being referred to in a more localising, familiarising way, and the new way of referring to them became so entrenched that it would just be more confusing to change them back."
todayilearned,fffwxa8,t1_ffff1o0,1579893596.0,"While acknowledging the enormous intellectual debt we owe to the Renaissance, I take glee whenever the ""Middle Ages"" is able to briefly escape from the reputation that the 15th Century Humanists gave to it in their crushing fanboyism over Classical Rome. Alhazen was overturning Classical theories of optics before William the Conqueror was even born, and Roger Bacon was able to write compendiums to the Pope detailing everything from mathematics to theology, from the recipe for gunpowder to theories of universal grammar, all to advance reform to the medieval university curriculum."
todayilearned,fffu78p,t1_fff3g49,1579891886.0,"It's commonly thought that ignorance and irrationality are the same thing, but rationality - the state of being persuaded by the force of reason - only requires a commitment to find the truth via enquiry. Even faulty premises can be built upon logically and can *approximate* the truth, at least until conclusions are reached which are clearly irreconcilable with each other or with observation of the world. Aristotle was incorrect in much of his worldview, but it wasn't irrational - what would've been irrational was if Newton, Einstein, and Darwin were able to go back in time to explain to him their discoveries and how they reached the conclusions they reached, and him still rejecting them after they had clarified all points."

I would argue that it allows both a purer version of capitalism *and* voluntary socialism to exist, by sweeping away the economic forces that allows, encourages, and reinforces aristocracy. By releasing you from the threat of absolute poverty, and letting you keep the full value of what you earn (by removing other, less efficient taxes, like Income Tax and VAT), you are freed to develop yourself and your income however you see fit."

That when your encounter a subject that gives you a bit more trouble than usual, that there's something about it you can't work out and you need some help in order to make it click, you feel like you can't tell them about it and ask them for help because doing so is only going to get you another lecture about how important it is to work hard, making you feel like you're failing before you have even actually failed. That they are not motivating you to find success, they're making you terrified of failure, or even appearing to have any imperfections at all, and that it is stopping you from learning effectively.

You need to bring it up with them unprompted, not when they come to you to ask how your grades are going, you can't let them feel like you're just deflecting.

Only then, when the forces for liberty and democracy have asserted their dominance, having closed ranks and made a thorough rejection of what the far-right stands for as being antithetical to what their society stands for (see the reaction in New Zealand following the Christchurch shooting as an example of this), can appeals be made in earnest to members for them to split off and accept deradicalisation."
