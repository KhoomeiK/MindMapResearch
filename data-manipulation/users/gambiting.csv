So if you happen to make loads of changes to your account very quickly you will get blocked until customer service unlocks you. I'd only get concerned if they refuse unlocking your account despite legitimate use."
WTF,ffbnfy0,t1_ffan8uv,1579774163.0,"Why do cards even have a magnetic strip still anyway. I haven't seen a terminal that can accept those in years, and nowadays it's very rare I can see a customer-facing chip reader either(I'm sure they have one behind the till if you need it, but almost every shop only has a contactless pad with a pin pad, no actual slot for the card anywhere)"
