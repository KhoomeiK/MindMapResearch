Meanwhile in the western African countries, people were refusing to admit they had it, or not taking family members who had it to the hospital. The result of that was 11,000 deaths. People obsessing about this might seem stupid, but China has locked down over 50 million people, they don't do that every day. It's possible the virus is a lot worse than we're being told, and due to past events getting worse because of denial, people are taking the whole thing very seriously.  
What's worse long term? People ""panicking"" and wearing a face mask when they go to an international airport, a preventable measure that could stop the spread of the virus, something that hurts no one and only protects people?

You don't usually just wander around a war alone and pick up followers for your own personal mission. Everyone has orders and commanders and places to be.  
Sending two people is the best way because if you sent more, things could get complicated. If people get injured, separated, or died, it'd make the act of getting the orders to stop the battle less likely to happen in the 16 hour time frame. And even with all that said and done, 1,600 people is a lot to try and save, but overall in a war that cost 17 million the best you can do is send two people to try and stop it. If he failed, well, everyone tried their best. There are other more important battles and moves to be made and more new troops being shipped over every day.  
Fun fact though, troops were not moved by trucks in ww1. The motorized vehicle was a pretty new invention and the technology to transport that much weight over that uneven of terrain did not exist. WW1 soldiers marched everywhere."

Sure we sacrificed, but there would be battles where germany/russia/france lost hundreds of thousands of lives. 400,000 American lives over the period of a year is terrible, but there are two battles where Russia lost a million people, at each one. France got invaded twice in 30 years. Civilians in London were bombed for 3 and a half months by the Nazis, killing 14,000 civilians. The narrative of ww2 seems to be drifting away from an alliance of different nations sacrificing together to stop the Nazi's steamroll across the world, and more towards ""America solely did it on their own, uphill, both ways, in the snow, in the dark, and you're terrible for suggesting otherwise.""  
That's the part we need to focus on, as the current American administration is backing out of several economic and military alliances that were forged from the sacrifices our soldiers in ww2 died for.  
What's all that sacrifice worth if we break away from the nations who sacrificed with us, and claim we did all the work?"

It's about the rise in white supremacy in late 2010s America, but with masks, and it focuses a lot of how we believe what we want to believe. The show runner put out a podcast talking about the episodes and what he's trying to say. It's good to listen."
television,fcfxf81,t1_fcft64k,1577634629.0,"There was an episode of the animated batman cartoon back in the 90s that sort of did that. Batman and Robin went to some low level dude's apartment to try and get info, and batman was being real rough, and the dude's kid was watching. Robin was all ""woahhhh lets chill out for a minute"" but batman kept going. I guess they were under a deadline or something. I believe it was the episode where Robin quits and then becomes Nightwing.  
edit: Old Wounds was the episode. https://www.topcartoons.tv/old-wounds/   
I've always wondered how batman felt technically being a criminal himself. Breaking and entering. Assault and battery. Removing evidence from a crime scene. A super villain trying to stop Batman could arguably be a hero in his own mind and by the letter of the law."
