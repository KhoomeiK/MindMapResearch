Mafia,ffcu194,t1_ffctvok,1579807248.0,I just personally have somewhat of a hard time believing Carlos portrayal of him as somebody who essentially would have been a serial killer otherwise. This just further proves to me that I can't take anything he said seriously. If I know damn well he was full of shit about Kuklinski and casso there is no reason to believe he was factual when it comes to Pitera

Mafia,ffcm8up,t1_ffcm0rj,1579802443.0,Seriously! The iceman was one long fairy tale. Literally almost nothing in it is true. Gaspipe is a completely self-serving rag which basically kisses Casso's ass the entire time. From what I have read elsewhere Pitera has been described as kind and generous with his fellow prisoners and extremely respectful of women. A real jekyl and hyde

Sonsofanarchy,fe2hzjx,t1_fe1s86k,1578838515.0,"No. But The Wire is def 95% believable to anyone who has been involved in hard drug culture. And the sopranos while more violent than actual modern mob life there was nothing even remotely close to as unreal as season 7 soa. The dozens of meaningless murders, chibs and the cop, not to mention the whole juice getting raped by the ab which was so ridiculous to anyone who has been to prison all i could do was yell at the tv. When a show goes so far beyond the realm of believable it hurts its overall quality. That being said, seasons 2-4 of SOA is some of the best tv ever made"

Sonsofanarchy,fdzfxpx,t3_en7egc,1578789859.0,"Without a doubt for me its Marcus Alvarez. Its often overlooked but imo he committed the most evil act to take place throughout the entire show. He delivered his son, his own fucking child, to be murdered to settle the score with the Sons. Happy kills his son right in front of him and its just another day. At least when Jax kills his mother it was to avenge Tara. Alvarez had his own child killed just to appease Clay and gain access to weapons"
Sonsofanarchy,fdwgn0c,t1_fdwf6v4,1578758450.0,Season 7 fucking sucked right up until the last 2 episodes. The ridiculous amount of meaningless violence and that stupid storyline with chibs and the cop. And yes the were committing what would be considered mass shootings weekly. The fucking national guard wouldve been called. You appear to be taking it personally that season 7 went off the rails
Sonsofanarchy,fdwcd85,t1_fdv6ryp,1578757271.0,Youre kidding right? You didn't find killing dozens and dozens of people every single week with no repercussions to be believable? Season 2 the club killed 4 people all season. The killed 4 people every 15 min by season 7. Its the reason The Sopranos and The Wire will always be better

Sonsofanarchy,fdt3vx5,t1_fdrv4d1,1578711580.0,Seasons 2 and 3 are by far the best seasons imo. The violence actually had meaning. By season 7 they were committing mass murder on a weekly basis. It got ridiculously campy.
morbidquestions,fdsaaa2,t1_fds9juc,1578697974.0,Yes a pacifist would almost certainly be seen as a coward by most especially in a close or max security joint.

rva,fdrgfec,t1_fdrfd78,1578684096.0,Thats true its why my neighbor gets 18 bucks an hour with minimal benefits while my father made 45 an hour for the same job and now has an 800 a week pension until death.

Down here from what a friend told me he was offered 10.50 an hour. Same with construction. What someone would be paid $40 an hour for in north jersey is getting maybe $15-$18 an hour.
