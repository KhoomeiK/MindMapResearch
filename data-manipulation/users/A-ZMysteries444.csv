OCD,ffit7vw,t1_ffisv5r,1579982124.0,"I- I didn’t. I chickened out and now I fucking hate myself. 

I’ve got another chance, we scheduled a physical in a few weeks and maybe I’ll talk then. 

But fuck me, I didn’t go through with it. I sat there furiously fighting with myself waiting to start talking and I just stayed quiet, the doctor left and then I got my stupid flu shot. 

I’m no inspiration and frankly I think I hate myself too much to actually do something productive for my health. 

Maybe I’ll say something my next appointment, I’ll have to or I will literally break down."
