depression,fcrmnin,t1_fcrbg92,1577903803.0,"You seem to have it half way done, so you are not far from the progress you want. It's like you said, it's all the little things. You don't need to finish it all in one go. Imagine, reading a book 1 page per day, in i year you would read a book that contains 365 pages . Not bad, right? Similar approach can be applied to life, talk each day a bit, maybe 2-5 mins. And by a month you will know more of what you can talk about to that person. Small steps, lead to a goal. We get overwhelmed when we think of a big picture or how we want it to be, but we forget all the steps that we need to get there.  


I hope it helps."
CasualConversation,fcqasif,t3_eig8ua,1577882326.0,"Those are some good thoughts that you discovered there. Don’t get me wrong with my post below. Everyone who comes in our lives bring a new experience for us, with that new experience now we need to get most of it/ learn from it. Some people need this more than the others but everyone is a like a mirror to use, where we could see in what area we need most help with. May that be human interaction, treatment of yourself with self respect, taking other opinions with grain of salt or just being kinder to others. 

It’s scary to move on and find someone who you could trust your deepest fears but you can’t give up. There is someone who will make you happy no matter of your issues. While that will take time, you work on to be become the best version of yourself everyday. Even if you are not the best version of yourself today or tomorrow, it’s s ok. Do better next day :)

Wish you best of luck."
CasualConversation,fcq9fpp,t3_eiekil,1577881524.0,So cool to hear this! Happy for you and happy new year bro.
depression,fcq8sgz,t3_eidxlt,1577881141.0,"Hello, sorry to hear you feeling this way.

Can i ask what do you regret the most from this last year?"
depression,fcq8d5g,t3_eibb6g,1577880893.0,"I’m sorry to hear that. Some people are not at the emotional level to show slight care for another human being and they act rude and insult all of the place. In fact those people need so much love but they just dont know how to show it. In my opinion if you accept this information it could help you cope with your next encounter. 

Stay strong."
depression,fcq5hnq,t3_dvcbu0,1577879155.0,"Hello, i wouldn’t say that you are sick in any way because of how you are atm. I have a girl that feels down sometimes and that is normal. Sometimes we all do shut ppl out for no apparent reason. I would ask you to do is keep asking yourself why do you do some thing you do, write it down and ask again why is that thing affecting me and what outcome scares me. You might get a new insight into why it’s happening. 

You are never alone in this so asking for help is a really good step."
