My comment was mostly about other commenters saying why this sub is garbage because we gave him advice where if we said go with the big company or don't go with the big company people are never happy about the suggestion. Can't please everyone but doesn't mean this sub is bad just there's a vary amount of opinions.

Also I love how everyone now gets on the bandwagon of how this is a horrible sub for advice yet the advice was valid and good. Even OP said himself he got what he wanted out of the choice being able to wear multiple hats.

Those extreme cases you have can be possibly paid by from your homeowners insurance maybe go over your plan you have with your agent to get a better understanding of your coverage. If you house was built along with other similar houses you can look on Zillow to see how other people are keeping up with the maintenance that you might be inspired to do.

Besides that maybe get on some anxiety meds if these things are still bother you for the past 2 years which is a rather long time to be worried about it."

personalfinance,fek1tc8,t1_fejs717,1579190794.0,"They can definitely try but they have no legal leg to stand on. It would be no different than an alive parent defaulting on their credit card or medical you get calls from collectors trying to milk you for money saying you have a ""moral obligation"" since they're your parents. It is however not a legal obligation or else they would just skip the nonsense and take you to court.

Edit: Also I'm not sure if this is how it works but I believe they could write it off as a loss and take a tax break from that so they still gain something in the end. Student debt also only stays with the student unless the parent cosign some kind of private loan. The student loans will not transfer to the parents if the student was to die that would be really messed up if your kid dies then you get all their student loan debt."
personalfinance,fejrbd2,t1_fejmjd0,1579183897.0,"That would be pretty illegal to just transfer debt from one person to another even if they are related. Imagine you haven't talked to an abusive father/mother in decades and he dies then they give you his debt f that I would be so pissed.

Unless you cosign the debt or loan you have no obligation to pay for a family members debt their estate does that. Anyone that says otherwise is probably a debt collector and you shouldn't take advice from your opposition."

It really lacks any progression at max lv besides the constant grind which yields very little everyday say leveling up your troops takes days since it's limit locked instead of being able to grind hours.

personalfinance,fejbl4n,t1_fej8yon,1579165777.0,It's completely reasonable owning a house is expensive just trying to keep up with the normal wear and tear will eat at their money. 35k/yr seems pretty low I can only imagine if they had car payments and the cars need maintenance or say the heat or a/c breaks that's easily a few thousands.

If you're looking to win and get some gift cards or an IPad or a big fat check or whatever they give now a days. There are some hackathon where the winners are usually people that have worked on the project extensively beforehand or reusing a previous project it's best to avoid those. Besides them the ones where you're not given the task beforehand it's best to stick with what you know as you realized you will spend an excessive amount of time learning something new where time is precious.
