fatlogic,fffoimr,t1_fffj8zm,1579888373.0,"That reminds me of a friend of mine who is losing weight using a low-carb diet.  A friend of his in Europe (we live in the US) was like ""But you need carbs!""

He pointed out to her that she lives in a hugely walkable city while he lives in suburban sprawl and that she usually gets more steps walking just to work than he gets in a day and she regularly trains for and runs 10ks and half-marathons.  *She* needs lots of carbs.  It's almost like different people have different nutritional needs and different ways to meet them and that people should mind their own business."
fatlogic,ff9xljv,t3_es20yb,1579723704.0,"This stuff pisses me off.  I have a friend who has a health condition (not weight related at all and nothing to do with diabetes/pre-diabetes) and her doctor suggested that she try a keto/low-carb diet since there was emerging research that it might help her manage her condition.  She was concerned that it might lead to weight loss/make people think she is trying to lose weight intentionally.  And many people on her friends list were saying things like ""It's probably not worth it, it's a risk to your health, and it won't set a good example for your daughters.""

And it's so frustrating.  She is seriously thinking she shouldn't try a dietary change that might help her manage a condition that she is so frustrated about and that is sometimes debilitating (she developed it about 2 years ago so it's pretty fresh comparison) because she's worried it's not body positive because ""weight loss is bad"".  Isn't trying to manage your health condition body positive?"
fatlogic,ff3jlyl,t1_ff09vda,1579542441.0,"My brother was like this as a kid.  No matter what he ate, he did not gain weight.  He was always super skinny and had tons of gastric issues.  Some of it was traced to food intolerance, but there was still a problem after cutting out the problem food.  The doctors couldn't find any other specific issues beyond ""something is causing inefficient food absorption.""

He went to join the military and the first time they y turned him away for being underweight and told him to gain 15 pounds.  And then in basic, they gave him double rations because he kept losing weight and having dizzy spells without the extra calories.  He's older now and it's less of a problem, but yeah, it's weird to see a fatlogic argument be ""true"" in real life (never mind that my brother is clearly a medical anomaly)."

AmItheAsshole,fef7n97,t1_fedupcf,1579050106.0,I spent more than $100 on my *prom dress* and that was \*cough\* years ago.
AmItheAsshole,fef6g5f,t1_feequom,1579049297.0,"I was freaking out a bit about what to wear to a company party once because I'd been having a hard time with my body image and it had been a hard few months.  My boyfriend was trying to be nice and didn't have much money, so he looked on Wish and bought me a dress that he thought I would like (based on the pics).  (He has a really good sense of what I look good in and 95% of the time if we're shopping together and he suggests clothing, it looks awesome when I try it on and I get tons of compliments, so he's usually really good about it).  He meant to surprise me.

Unbeknownst to me, that site was Wish.  And he didn't know what it was.  The dress arrived 2 months late (way after the party, we had to do some emergency shopping in the week before) and was a mess.  We had a good laugh.  But yeah, people still fall for it."
AmItheAsshole,fef5u6n,t1_fef213p,1579048883.0,And that's just called tailoring.  Which is what he had done for himself on the tuxedo he is wearing.

And Emma should run.  Because you sound like a controlling asshole."
FundieSnark,feeznqy,t1_feeycip,1579044758.0,It's quite possible that she sits on a throne of lies.  I wouldn't put it past her.
AmItheAsshole,feezdmz,t3_eoo84b,1579044576.0,"NTA.  So much Not the asshole.

Your mother's behavior here is *awful*.  It's bad enough that she continues to deny you privacy and agency after you've asked her to stop recording you, but she also sounds like one of those ""AuTisM MoMs"" who use the fact that their kid isn't neurotypical to get attention."
WelcomeToPlathville,feeov4i,t1_feenh2x,1579038123.0,"The subject of a sentence is what does the verb while the object is acted upon.  In this case the implied subject of the sentence is ""you"", since it's an imperative (as in ""You should come meet us!"").  If the contest was to meet just him and not Marsha, the correct grammar would be ""join *me""* not ""join *I*"" because the (implied) subject of the sentence is you.  You (subject) are meeting him (object).  Adding another person to the group of people to be  met doesn't change that they are still the object of the sentence.  So ""Marsha and me"" is correct."
FundieSnark,feelcws,t1_fecwnmw,1579036091.0,"There are many many branches of fundamentalists that subscribe to the whole ""Ham was the cursed brother who was sent to Africa and so black people are less than us"" kind of thing.  So maybe hashtag notall but there is a strong thread in several of the communities"
FundieSnark,feektbt,t1_fecdx5s,1579035772.0,I was just coming to say that.  It definitely resonates with the IBLP umbrella thing.
FundieSnark,feej0t7,t3_eofrfx,1579034735.0,"With regards to discussing it online, she's doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.  Her silence is to ""avoid controversy"" when the best response is ""It's none of your damn business what my kid's dick looks like.  It's not my right to disclose that kind of information about my child's body.  It's a violation of his privacy."""
FundieSnark,feeh270,t1_fee3y4n,1579033603.0,"She talks about it here:  [http://archive.is/UOnXR](http://archive.is/UOnXR) 

I guess there was a CPS complaint."
AmItheAsshole,fe6sw7x,t3_eno5q8,1578903853.0,NTA. And he is rude as hell for asking what you’re taking. Your medication is none of his business.
AmItheAsshole,fe6stmp,t3_ensbqt,1578903752.0,"NTA. Also, I commend you as a parent for respecting his wishes. I see too many parents with disabled/deaf/neuroatypical children completely deny their children’s agency when it comes to their interactions with the world."
fatlogic,fdh9xdc,t1_fdh6zzj,1578418546.0,I hope that you and the doctors are able to come up with a good treatment/management plan soon.  Chronic issues suck and people are complete dicks sometimes.
fatlogic,fdh8v34,t3_el4ptk,1578417902.0,"Look, when my mom was severely anorexic, it was very apparent *from her weight* that she was sick.  When people are on My 600 Lb Life and can't get out of bed and have lymphedema everywhere, *they are sick*.  There is a point where weight does indicate serious health issues.  People with these kinds of health issues deserve and need compassion and adequate care, but that doesn't include pretending that their weight is not indicative of a problem."
fatlogic,fdegqc7,t1_fdedwty,1578338659.0,"Totally agree.  Also, the contestants on TBL were not given any actual skills/habits for weight loss or maintenance for once they were off the show.  If you put someone in a controlled environment where they only have access to the food you give them and their only job is to work out and focus on weight loss, of course they will lose weight.  But they won't be able to keep that up in the real world because they haven't learned any good habits about tracking calories, portion control, figuring out how to deal with social situations around a lot of food, fitting exercise into a normal daily schedule, and just generally keeping up these behaviors with *self* motivation instead of the external motivation of Jillian yelling at them."
fatlogic,fdbr3ic,t1_fdbqw7n,1578260596.0,I can see that too
fatlogic,fdbcid4,t1_fdah61o,1578255996.0,THANK YOU!  I kept thinking she looked like someone else now that she’s lost weight but I couldn’t figure out who
fatlogic,fb93xlt,t1_fb924hh,1576628735.0,I'm just going to say that at not that much smaller I absolutely lost weight eating 1400 calories a day.  I'm not even that active.  And I've been losing weight very slowly.  But weight loss happened.
