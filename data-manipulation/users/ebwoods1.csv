Did you wake up confused?"

Clearly your son is not a free loader. He's working towards his career. Would she have this issue if he was living home and going to college?

To reiterate what others have said, is there a way to set up that room so guests could use it as well? Is there an option for him to sleep elsewhere when there is company? (I have to think her desire to have her sisters around when the baby is born to partly be driving this). 

Is he willing to work on being tidier? I clean up after my sons and I admit, it wears on me. Wires and gaming items will become an issue when your baby becomes mobile. 

Either way. It's sounds like there may be some room for compromise. 

Congratulations on raising a young man (from such a young age!) who is goal oriented and working on a trade that suits him. 

Congratulations on your baby to be. He/she has a terrific father."

You said service dog. For whom? To do what? People who have service dogs don't tend to leave them locked in crates for so long. They tend to NEED the dogs to perform tasks.

3. Yet another cat who had a favorite color (green), only played with one specific brand of toy mouse (the green ones), loved playing fetch with this green mouse toys, and the would drop them in his food dish. 

4. And yes, another cat that would get on the roof and catch bats. BATS. We'd hear him running and jumping after them. He also once brought home a hawk.

Forgot one. Green mouse cat also likes lobster fishing shows. He wouldn't settle down to go to bed until we turned on one. Ended up having to record a few episodes when they switched the channel line up.

I can relate to your son, only I look 100% Asian. We moved to this tiny all white town. I felt so alien, had no clue where I fit in. I learned to despise my Asian features.

(not to mention the teasing I got due to looking different and my ethnic last name - the dropping coins on the floor to the sounds of ""Ching! Ching!"" stand out the most)

As I got older, and moved to a more diverse area, I then experienced dismissal from the Asian community b/c I don't speak the language and am only half (Asians can tell I am mixed). I basically went from being called ""chink"" to ""gweilo.""

EntitledPeople,fei91g6,t3_ep8p9p,1579132992.0,"Way to sexualize a toddler. 

They have serious issues."
AmItheAsshole,fei8lyi,t1_fehfp9e,1579132713.0,"That's a pathetic excuse. 

You're not forcing your religion on anyone. You're bringing homemade treats to share. What an ignorant waste of a chance to learn something cool about a coworker. 

Wish we worked together. I'd love to sample your sweets and talk about your culture and holiday."
AmItheAsshole,feh5rg8,t3_ep1uwm,1579109717.0,Nope. NTA. No wedding should break the bank. Goes double for a wedding that isn't your own.
aww,feh5ka5,t1_fegy8eg,1579109597.0,"Hahaha. Ours would do the same. Tight, angry ball, with her ears directed at you. She'd slowly inch her way backwards until she's alllllmost touching. Then it's up to us to reach the last few inches. Then she's purr and look pissed off about for a bit, then she's succumb to the warm lap (roast beef helps)."
aww,fegr4o9,t3_eowddu,1579100579.0,"Well yeah. There's a warming lamp, a soft bed and a friend. 

I'd stay in there too!"

You should never pull your hair back, you don't have the right face for it. 

You have such big She-Rah legs. 

You're wearing ... that?


I have boys. I will never talk to them like ... that."
AmItheAsshole,fegdyfy,t3_eos6j1,1579089351.0,"After reading your edits this is hard to judge. You really are TA for reading someone's private thoughts. But she's a teen who was never taught to communicate and was desperate for affection. Leaving her diary out was her way of asking for help. 

So in the end, you are a kick ass Bonus Mom who broke a rule to help your Bonus Kid."
IdiotsInCars,fef8hxo,t3_eoem27,1579050685.0,"11 years in SFL. That sh*t doesnt surprise me anymore. I learned very quickly to never just ""go"" when the light turns green."
aww,fef3vrr,t1_feet32r,1579047563.0,"Great shot kid, it's one in a million!!"
JUSTNOMIL,fef3ixu,t3_eopzae,1579047325.0,"I'm so sorry. That must be very difficult and frustrating. 

Please also consider that moving to the US will isolate you from your home comforts and support system. You will be on your own with your wife and HER MOTHER. 

The wedding has been postponed several times. Your fiancée has already given her answer. She is not ready to marry you if that also means drawing healthy boundaries with her mother."
AmItheAsshole,feenxfr,t3_eoonnf,1579037578.0,"NTA. 

She is in a bind but it is entirely not your problem or responsibility."
AmItheAsshole,fedu9u1,t3_eok9zk,1579020025.0,NTA. Wash the gloves.
