I've trawled through every search result I could find and this is the only one that remotely looks like a dedicated lumber yard. I have found that Southerlands has a reasonably good selection of plywood, some with hardwood veneer, and treated lumber."

BeginnerWoodWorking,ff78pug,t3_es0w8s,1579643334.0,This is a solid post. It is however shocking how lousy it can be to actually find a lumber yard. I'm in a city of over 300k people and I've been able to find literally one lumber yard.

personalfinance,fekznwa,t1_fekl101,1579210937.0,"You will have a transcript but it will show withdrawals instead of grades. In Texas, if you drop after the census date for the class, for full semester length classes that would be the 12th day of class (for the semester, not for the individual class) your transcript reflects a withdrawal. The state limits the the number of drops a student is allowed and they do impact your financial aid or veteran's benefits if you have them. The reason that you don't get a refund at this point is because you have already been reported to the state as part of our enrollment reporting."

Personally, if it were my problem and it really is fully cured, super light taps with a tack hammer to break up the resin and then scrape off the pieces. Start on top of the plate so that you don't damage the build surface, you might be able to get it all off without ever having to do more than scrape it. Maybe try a bath in IPA first to make sure it really is fully cured."

It wasn't so much that he didn't want to do it, it's that he did it in a meeting with the exec, her (I seem to remember it was a woman, I could be wrong) staff, and all of his staff, in the most confrontational ""go fuck yourself"" way possible."
AnycubicPhoton,fcb8tyw,t1_fcar0vy,1577583866.0,"It's probably not a size thing. You might need to check to see if it's formatted for ntfs or fat32. The printer doesn't recognize ntfs. If you're working from windows, insert your drive, open your computer directory, right click on the drive and format it. It should prompt you to select a type from a drop-down menu.

todayilearned,fcaw7kv,t1_fcaume9,1577577826.0,Titus tells the story of what happened. His version is that he told the execs that were trying to dictate the direction of the show to pound sand. They apparently responded by giving them the Firefly treatment and moving their timeslots over and over until their ratings were bad enough to justify killing the show. His pride caused the ultimate cancellation but that only happened because the Fox execs were dicks.

I rented in the bluff for two years before I bought a house in Calallen. I work in town and the commute is basically the same. Northwest Boulevard has a lot of development going on but it's still far enough out to have more of a small town feel to it. All of the important staples are nearby but if you need to go into town you can get most anywhere in twenty to thirty minutes. Downside is that if you're looking for any kind of night life, it doesn't exist out here."

I guess either the Dire Wolf or the King Crab. They're both better at their jobs than the Atlas is at whatever the hell the Atlas is supposed to do.

 In a sense, I like mechs that have a job."
