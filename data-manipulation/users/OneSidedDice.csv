Later, I dismissed it as a byproduct of jetlag or the spicy fish stew from lunch, but it seemed that the air became brighter--attenuated somehow. I inhaled the scent of growing things from a foreign breeze and heard the recording of the child's happy song echo from the blank facades of the deserted city. I felt the secretive allure of a world where mankind was gone, annihilated by our greed and our need to control, which led to experiments with poorly-understood viral DNA. A world free of its teeming billions to explore at leisure. A push on the exit door and a short step down would have taken me there, I was sure.

I thought of my family back at home. I looked around at the cheerful faces on my bus and the throng of people and cars surging through the streets. I turned away from the door and closed my eyes until I heard the engine rev. As the bus began to move, I turned back around.

The air smelled of combustion fumes, and the park's amusement rides were all in motion. Sometimes in my dreams I still hear the child's voice singing It's A Small World as if from a great distance, and wake with a sense of longing that haunts my morning thoughts."
