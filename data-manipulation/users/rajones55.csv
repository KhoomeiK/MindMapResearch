(24 now) What's helped me was (after a suicide attempt landed me in the psych hospital), I made 2 fabulous awesome friends and they helped me to gain confidence in who I am, not only my looks, but who I am as a person (humor, the way I express myself) and this was the most powerful tool in my journey thus far. It also made me realize that sitting down and being in my head was my worst enemy. I need to get up and take action, not ponder over things, because that ends up just making things seem bigger than they really are."

CasualConversation,ffusz4w,t3_ev9lpm,1580248765.0,"Short term: Trying to find friends with my same stupid humor and energy level and trying to build these friendships into meaningful ones. 

Long term: I got my first job at 24 years old recently and my first day is tomorrow and I'm excited! I have been struggling with anxiety and depression the last 7 or so years since dropping out of high school and it all amounted to a suicide attempt in mid-December, followed by a psych hospital trip for about 4 days. Those 4 days were the most impactful days I have ever faced in my life. I met people that taught me things and I met people that inspired me to get up and move forward and not be afraid of being myself. I made close friends, I grew my social skills, I was freed of everything that held me back, though the dark still tries to pull me back, I have the weapons to fight back now. I've grown into the person I wish I always was but I don't regret any of the time I spent in my early adulthood either. I now have a long term goal of making it to the UFC , the biggest stage in MMA, so that I can reach people who need help the same as I did. I have a goal thats bigger than me. I never want anyone else to face this same pain that I once faced, the same pain I once felt. I wanna be able to let people know that there is hope and there are hands ready to pull them out of the dark. I wanna be the lighthouse that guides the ship through the stormy dark night. I wanna fight for more than a belt or money. I wanna fight for and in honor of the strangers who need a voice and a hand and in honor of the ones I care about. 

The friends I hold dear, the faces I've met and the loved ones I hug and kiss give me the strength to be myself and accomplish this goal. Theres no more fear in my heart, there is only the energy in my action."

Don't worry so much about being lonely though. I think we tend to forget about a lot of the small things in life, we are never as lonely as we think and besides, people change, they come and go. Get up and go live, things happen for a reason. Give me a smile. Life goes on. ;)"
