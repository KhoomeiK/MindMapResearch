funny,fgsrmbb,t1_fgsppm5,1581091180.0,"I got a message from a pretty, interesting, and reasonably local girl the other day. I was very excited. We were talking about movies and TV. Fifteen minutes in, her replies really slowed down. At the one-hour mark, I realized that a lot of time had passed since my last message to her, so I refreshed the page to see if the green dot would change color indicating she was no longer online. Instead the whole conversation disappeared because she had unmatched (and presumably blocked) me.

I was so sad. She was probably chatting with a couple of guys at the same time and I just didn't keep her attention.

It's just one interaction with one random woman, but the downside to living in Hazzard County is that there *just isn't anyone around*.  Anybody halfway desirable is snapped up in a heartbeat. The profiles that are most compatible with me are always an hour and a half away, on the far side of the nearest major city."

Exactly! For some reason, at the gym, with the phone in my pocket, it gets skippy and broken up when i move my leg. I don't know if all the gym goers with their Bluetooth headphones creates interference or what.

The big manufacturers have been eliminating the jack on their premium models since Apple declared it ""courageous"" to do so. They've been spreading the practice to their mid tier devices as well.

AskReddit,fgqauo5,t1_fgpz0up,1581020964.0,"I'm in my 40s and I do the exact same thing. I've got two bicycles and I love to leave the car behind for short trips. There's a country road nearby with a wooden bridge beside a lake. That road goes past a horse farm and a field with some sheep on it. I love to cruise down it in the late summer evening as the fireflies start to come out and glow. 

There's also an abandoned house I found that you can't see from the street in a car because the plant life has grown up around it. It's collapsing dangerously and is missing an entire wall. The floor has fallen into the basement. Water can be heard trickling down there, and a million bees buzz in the walls and ceilings where they've made a giant hive.

I would never have seen this stuff from a car, or even my motorcycle.

I was there once. Fucking bike had developed a charging system problem. My gf and I were supposed to ride to breakfast, but after we geared up and got on the fucking battery was dead. So i pushed that heavy fucker up a slight gravel incline out to the main road, which was fortunately atop a decent hill. Coasting down the hill allowed me to pop start it and ride back up to the top. She got on but the bike was now wedged against the curb, and in trying to ease it off I stalled it. 

So I had her get off again and pushed the bike around to face down the hill for another pop start attempt. In turning it around, in my sweaty exhaustion and emasculation, I dropped it. 

Now I'm *really* embarrassed! Panting, I asked her to help me right it. This pop start attempt failed and now the dead bike was marooned at the bottom of the hill.

I finally accepted defeat and asked her to drive us to breakfast.  At least the pancakes were good."
