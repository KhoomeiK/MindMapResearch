offmychest,fg4qp5x,t1_fg4q3qm,1580508990.0,"I’ve been trying to find the purpose for years. The only thing I could be thinking about is something personal that doesn’t happen anymore. 
I’m someone good with tech so I do help people with that it just doesn’t make me feel good idk why.
My “community” is small cuz it’s a small town. We don’t have anything that goes on really. 
And Idk for goals 

Thanks for your help"
offmychest,fg4qhd8,t1_fg4pea4,1580508850.0,"I am gonna have a talk with them tmr. I’ve been planning this sense Tuesday. I already have a coping mechanism either eating, not eating, ignoring it, or keeping myself busy. 
I do talk to a therapist. He isn’t really helping I give him something in my life and he either doesn’t help or he responds in a way which makes me think he doesn’t understand"
depression_help,fg41i80,t3_ewlc5d,1580494193.0,Did you start antidepressants? Or what did you do?
AppleWatch,fg3uiyp,t1_fg3u8ss,1580489959.0,It is registering in the actual app. During school I can do between 4 and 25 minutes for exercise so tnah could possibly be it. I have the same route everyday but that’d make sense thanks.
unpopularopinion,fg3trpw,t3_ewktc2,1580489500.0,That’s kinda funny now that you think about it. But we would still have to brush our teeth so we don’t smell
depression,ffc2bm9,t3_eslvlt,1579789773.0,"I read a interesting article about this, sense myself I don’t want to get better. You should read it too it can answer a lot of questions.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201405/why-dont-you-want-feel-better%3famp"
depression,feycatu,t1_fetlgnr,1579443663.0,It’s not worth it imo it’s so common and it’s just not worth it for me
depression,fess4xu,t1_fesrey8,1579368452.0,I know I just don’t see the worth in me getting help cuz I’m a piece of shir and don’t deserve it. I know I’m depressed the doctor diagnosed me but when I go back in a month I’m probably gonna deny it cuz fuck me im meant to be this way for a reason
depression,fespqxj,t3_eqc90a,1579367727.0,I’m like that too but I don’t feel like I deserve help and probably won’t get any help
Windows10,fejvp3r,t3_epiw7u,1579186931.0,I got that glitch a few months ago. It is a cool glitch and I like it that way. They should make it a option. It woudnt be that hard
AppleSupport,fehctzk,t1_feh5w4b,1579113923.0,I did a reset with a iCloud backup. I dint really use that many apps. I have Snapchat but I don’t use it that much
depression,feh4sfy,t1_fefb5k5,1579109140.0,I’m just like that too. I suck at everything here’s what I’ve done. Just kidna given up. You don’t need a gf to live
Windows10,feh4lpd,t3_ep272d,1579109029.0,My old school still had xp when I graduated (2019) and they probably still do. But they did upgrade some computers to 7 so they might’ve went to 10
AppleSupport,fegauh4,t1_feg481k,1579085424.0,My overall battery health tells me I’m at 89%
depression,fefcm81,t1_fefc55s,1579053408.0,Amen brother. I have nothing against medicine or lifestyle changes or anything but it’s just so crazy
depression,fef30dk,t1_fef1l2v,1579046980.0,"God damn, I’m sorry.  Addiction is a horrible thing. I’m sorry the antidepressants didn’t work on ur mom and now ur experiencing depression.
Stay strong."
depression,fef0g0y,t1_feez4j5,1579045271.0,"Yeah I get that, I’m very hesitant to go on antidepressants because I’m nervous they won’t help and it’ll change my personality, my therapist rly doesn’t help with my issues and call them “teenage things” don’t know why. I’ve heard from a few people who’ve been on antidepressants they work but still."
depression,fef08ht,t1_feeydo8,1579045133.0,"You’re one person you can’t cause a huge mental epidemic. This isn’t like the flu where if your near someone who has it you can get it. It probably is our society, everyone cares abt social media and such. I just don’t get why when they see someone post something on social media think “well they had a good time today, but I know they don’t have a perfect life cuz no one does. They just hide it behind the scenes.”"
depression,fef01nj,t1_feeygzb,1579045010.0,Yeah I get that. I’m depressed (I’ve been sense 8) and i don’t rly see a issue with it. It’s normalized for me like your psychologist said.  I don’t think my depression is half bad cuz all I feel is numb and empty not even sad that often.
depression,feev5ca,t1_feeo7sa,1579041889.0,Maybe it’s because you grew up this way and it’s like second nature to you?
depression,feev3hr,t1_feegrjp,1579041857.0,"Yeah ikr, like I get why some are depressed (abuse could be a reason) but it’s overall just sad."
depression,feev126,t1_feebg9z,1579041815.0,Oh jeez I’m sorry. That sucks. It’s crazy how the world is now
depression,feeuxln,t1_fee8vwg,1579041756.0,Yeah I get where people get depressed over social media. People just don’t understand that others don’t have a perfect life and stuff goes on behind the scenes. I have social media but i don’t care about what people post. I just use it for texting.
depression,fdw6n90,t3_en7336,1578755599.0,"Yes! I get that, I want help but at the same time I don’t. Idk what the cause it but I’ll probably stay depressed. I completely get you"
depression,fdkag2g,t3_elqwy9,1578499713.0,I’ve been constantly criticized by my parents basically learned nothing was enough and I think chemical imbalance
Windows10,fdf8ut4,t3_ekzbmo,1578356010.0,Wow
depression,fddi4rf,t3_ekqoek,1578313237.0,So have I. I’ve seen a therapist for a bit of time and I might go on meds. I’m proud of u random stranger.
