gaming,ffflehe,t1_ffffq3f,1579886482.0,Not for me.  Two 12 hour days of classes and a full 50 hr a week job.  When I graduated it was like holy shit **TWO WHOLE DAYS TO MYSELF**?!?
politics,fffkemr,t1_fffj843,1579885869.0,"Mass chaos...authoritarian.  Honestly that sounds pretty dumb or that you’re purposefully pushing a fear narrative that spooky socialism is going to turn America commie.  You love the status quo because you’re an Obama democrat (that doesn’t see his flaws apparently) and support Biden and Buttigieg.  It is what it is.  I’m not going to change your mind but people like you ARE part of the problem because you have no issue with a corrupt American system.  

You say Bernie will not win, I say Biden will not beat trump.  You call me naive, I’d like to point you back to 2016 when the same shit that you’re peddling now wasn’t enough to keep trump out of the White House.  Now we have Hillary Clinton .5 who stumbles in his speaking consistently and does *unbearably* creepy shit on camera.  I’m pushing for Bernie as hard as I can but I know exactly what we’re up against.  Biden is going to be eaten alive by Trump.  You’re hilariously naive if you don’t see that.  I didn’t like Hillary at all but at least she was honed razor sharp.  Biden is a loaf of bread in comparison."

politics,ffffyxh,t1_fffbb3c,1579883124.0,"Well yeah, of course you don’t.  You’re part of the problem we’re trying to fix and one of the things anyone supporting Bernie has to deal with.  You love your status quo, we don’t.  That’s fine but I really hope your guy loses and I hope you vote blue even if Bernie wins."

technology,ffd2lyi,t1_ffd1tbr,1579812189.0,"If you want to apply the purity test, Sanders comes back looking better than all the other candidates by a large margin.  If you care about corruption and money in politics he’s the only one I have any faith in to address it at all.  I get it, you don’t like him and you see too much of his supporters on reddit.  But equating Bernie supporters to Trump supporters just seems silly to me.  Your prerogative though, not like I’m going to change your mind."
