Well maybe Internet Wokies should have thought about that before they curated a culture of stuff like ""Woah dude, you had someone do a voice over on your content that had/has a NoNo thought? Sorry bruv you're *cancelled*"" and then act shocked when that shit gets turned on them because Bernie had a guy they've literally called a 'Pipeline to the Altright' (and worse) endorse him.

politics,ffsrtlj,t1_ffrpvvb,1580190169.0,"If Bernie is betting on California, that isn't/shouldn't be a super comforting thing for him or his supporters.


Hillary won it both times she ran, and if Biden *is* HRC version 2.0 like Bernie supporters have been calling him, that should be alarming yes? California very much favors ""Established"" Democratic candidates. Now does that sound more like Bernie or Biden?

Anyway, since Mondale (around like 36 years ago) every eventual Dem nominee has won California- minus Obama. If on Super Tuesday Biden wins it instead of Bernie, that's going to be a serious kick in the balls to the Sanders campaign. Add in Biden more than likely running a wheelhouse in the southern state primaries and I just don't see a surplus of hope for anyone not named Joe.

politics,ffsq9dk,t1_ffrsf24,1580188695.0,">So, your opinion is that Hillary Clinton is so politically inept, she had no idea that her opinion as the 2016 nominee on a potential 2020 nominee would be major news?


Man this would really be a toughie tbh. Because even just going solely on what we all saw during 2016, there's arguably enough evidence to make that case (the politically inept one). At the same time, there's no way her hubris would allow her to *not* think that whatever she said woul be major news.

Source? Which university/research foundation published this?

>Fallon Fox HAS lost a fight to a cis woman, which kind of blows up this theory.

This is flawed logic though? The guy you're replying to didn't say it made them unbeatable. That's not what he was saying claiming no? 

Also just because a person has an advantage doesn't guarantee them a win 100% of the time right? ""See this thing happened before, so it disproves what you said"" seems like a flimsy argument."
