Marriage,fgn2r48,t1_fgl8kly,1580936579.0,I’m in therapy. I was on medication before I tried to conceive. I’ve been trying to avoid it while I’m pregnant if I can help it. The second I have the baby I have zero issue with going back on meds.
Marriage,fgks9ty,t3_ez1bnf,1580872480.0,"I was always against them, until recently when my husband started his own law firm, I started a new job, and was going through IVF. My anxiety has been out of control, and I’d wake up in the middle of the night with him not there and panic, or I’d not be able to get a hold of him for hours because he was with clients and freak out. 

He turned on tracking so that if I woke up and he wasn’t there, I could easily locate him and not start having a panic attack (anxiety is such a bitch). 

It also comes in handy when I texted him hours ago and didn’t get a response. Oh, look, he’s still in court in a Brooklyn and probably has barely looked at his phone. 

I don’t check it a million times a day, and I never thought I’d want to track my spouse. For me, it’s just a way to curtail my anxiety (“husband isn’t answering; he must be dead” is where my brain automatically goes) and that’s all."
