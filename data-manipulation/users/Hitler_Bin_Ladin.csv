Terraria,ffhcs4d,t1_ffhbcsd,1579930139.0,Glitches that make the game way too easy are just not fun for me. Like how in minecraft my friend showed me a duplication glitch and we started duping everything. It got to the point where there wasn't a need to build farms or anything anymore because we could just dupe a shulker box full of anything which just sucked all enjoyment of the game for us.

Hes been under a lot of stress especially with the 10 million subscriber mark he just passed. He also went into some past stories about how he was bullied throughout school, and how an organization (cant remember if it was make a wish, but something similar at least) reached out to him about helping a really young kid who had leukemia.  He said he feels like retiring, but hes not going to. He also mentions that hes not promising that he wont retire."

PublicFreakout,ff5g3wi,t1_ff5f4sa,1579591358.0,This is correct. Racial discrimination was abolished in America in 1964. There are still people today that would not hire a black man or women simply because of their color. India has honestly had it worse with how openly discriminatory the general public is. I'm Indian and have spent a lot of time in India and I can say firsthand how backwards thinking a lot of people are over there.

This has led to a lot of people being treated as subhuman, especially untouchables which are the lowest caste, because their religion allows it. It has gotten better over recent times, but the tradition has been around since before christ and at its roots is disgusting."

The first step is to remain calm, or else you're as good as dead. Always look a cougar straight in the eyes and never turn your back to it, EVER, or it will attack. Always stand tall and don't run because they see a sitting or fleeing human as vulnerable prey. Stretch your arms to the side as though you were t-posing (It sounds like I'm memeing but I assure you it helps) and say something, anything, in your best intimidating deep voice. Try to give the thing a couple escape options so that it won't attack you out of fear of being cornered. Back away slowly. If it still follows you then throw things like rocks or branches near it to scare it, but DO NOT throw something at it and provoke it. And if everything fails and it still charges at you then do your best. Good luck."
