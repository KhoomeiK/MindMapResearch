Question though- do you ever allow yourself to have ""off days"" or little short periods where you don't correct said thoughts? It seems very tiring to need to rebut your thoughts at every turn. Do you not feel mentally exhausted? What kept you going?

And the journal is a great idea. (though sometimes I'm unsure that I can find one good thing lol)

Did you do other things together besides those you stated? It would be a miracle if what you said alone can change one's way of thinking.

selfimprovement,fcn9au3,t1_fcmhsyu,1577806567.0,"- Current stresses... Being able to support myself in the future? The depression and anxiety makes it hard to keep a part time job for very long. I can draw, but its not at a level where I can be a professional artist, and art isn't looked well upon in my country.

I get nightmares often and take a long time to sleep. To be honest, I can't entirely remember the bullying outside of several specific but very clear moments of when it happened. But at times I still get nightmares about it and real life stuff etc and that doesn't help.

Wanting to stay alive is another one. My grandma having dementia is yet another. Another would be being a burden on my parents. They're supportive now but idk..

Another would be just being lonely and having nearly zero friends who I can talk to about depression or my concerns. I can talk to my mom and shes understands better than a random passerby, but it's not really at the level where its helpful when I have urges to die or am severely depressed. 

My parents are trying but sometimes I feel sad that I'm not progressing much interms of healing or in life. Seems like everyone is progressing ahead without me. (If you watch steven universe future, this weeks's episodes 9 and 10 are basically what I'm experiencing. Helping others but to the point where I'm suffering with no one left to help me. And in the meantime, everyone is changing or has moved on.)

Anyway, I'm surprised that I rambled so much. If you read this much and have a reply at all, kudos to you for taking the time to help. I appreciate that dearly."
selfimprovement,fcn8lqf,t1_fcmhsyu,1577806078.0,"Thank you for taking the time to comment. I'll type what I can but my mood sucks atm.

I basically have diagnosed depression, anxiety and derealisation/depersonalisation from high school bullying for 2 years.

- My parents as a kid (mostly my mom) were pretty much the I want you to score well, strict type. Got lots of canings as a kid lol. After I got depression though she's become more understanding, encourages me to ""just do my best"" and our relationship has improved.

- Bullying was more psychological and with words. (Eg. I was suppoed to hand the class rep the class key one time, and they literally stated in my face that I needed to wash it first before giving it back.) There was one main bully that basically had one giant clique etc. They still think they've done no wrong till today lol. The whole class basically sans two people treated me like the plague. Didn't help that the school did a LOT of group work and I was always the last to be picked despite being a decent (B?) student. Another example was when we were supposed to sit in two columns in the morning as a class but everyone refused to sit next to me. The people behind also left a giant gap and didnt want to shift forward. Things like that that I endured for two years, while I tried to be a nice person. I cried a lot in the toilets, and was alone and frustrated. I transferred out in year 3 when I found out that the main bully was going to be in the same class as me again.

Honestly if i could go back, fighting back would have been what I'd have done. Or at the very least, gotten my parents to get the school to be more serious about disciplining them. 2 years of ostracising to the point of torture-- till I became afraid of school, broken self esteem, self hate, depression and anxiety without proper punishment for those people is just terrible. (My parents tried once, but the school didn't take it seriously or help.)

- I'm on viepax right now, one pill a day. It ""helps"" somewhat I suppose? It doesn't make things worse but I get cycles of depression still.

- It depends, it gets triggered by unkind people/something badhappening in my life, when I get too anxious/stressed out continuously and then it stays for several days and hits like a truck. At times the depression just causes it to come for no reason. It slowly subsides slightly but my mood at best is neutral. My guess is that the cycle repeats itself every 2 weeks, give or take a week or two?"
