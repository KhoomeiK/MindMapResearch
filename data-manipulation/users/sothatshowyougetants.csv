I understand fully that everybody gets flamed, but being flamed for your gender is a totally different ballpark than just being flamed for in-game reasons. I've also heard how people react to another player who sounds black... that shit makes my heart hurt and I empathize with them."

I adore dogs, cannot wait to get one. But I'm not gonna be patting myself on the back when it bonds with me. That isn't impressive in the slightest, it's a dog. Now, my cat missing me when I'm gone for 2 weeks and greeting me with enthusiasm when I come home? Epic. Him refusing to be away from me if he can help it? Amazing. He cuddles me just as much after he's been fed, it isn't for food. He comes to me for comfort because he loves me. Dog people don't understand though, they genuinely think only dogs can love their owner. It's a very simply mindset."

Cats feel certain vibes, I'm sure of it.  I don't know if the word I'm looking for is 'worthy', but... they probably just don't vibe with you much. Some people are just naturally more appealing to them."

aww,ffcodjh,t1_ffccytj,1579803757.0,"But... you're just further proving small dogs are too inbred to be healthy. You shouldn't need to pop his legs back into place. I can't imagine financially supporting breeders who would sell you a dog that literally has to have its legs popped back into place and telling you to your face that the dog is 'just as healthy' as other breeds. That's wrong. I'm sure you love your puppy and I'm sure it is super cute and adorable and I don't mean to be rude, but it's strange to be talking about how healthy it is when it was literally born with an incurable medical condition."

&#x200B;

Conan Exiles, Ark: Survival Evolved, 7 Days to Die, Minecraft, The Forest - all of these are crafting/survival type games where you have free roam and can build a base and work together. Personally my absolute favorite way to game with my partner. I love feeling like we are building something together, it's like the nerdiest version of playing house imaginable. The only shitty thing is that these games are usually glitchy and can get boring once you have everything, there's typically nothing left to do other than raid other people and that can become a nightmare with how toxic teenage boys can be. If Ark had an adults only server and they patched some of the awful game-breaking glitches I would be playing it all the time again. Honestly it is so much fun starting out in Ark and Conan, and you can get a lot of hours into it even if you eventually get bored. It takes a while to get to that point. The Forest is probably the best survival game in terms of story, AI, and how smoothly the game runs. Barely any glitches. But it isn't as robust in content and is honestly kind of frightening lol. 

&#x200B;

Apex, Fortnite, Titanfall, Left 4 Dead 2 (only on PC and Xbox I think) are fun shooters. Overwatch as well.

&#x200B;

Civilization 6 has been pretty fun to play with my partner mainly because we can do couch coop and not have to be on separate consoles/different rooms. You can also play online together.

&#x200B;

We also like playing single player story games together, mainly Life is Strange. Just take turns with the controller."
