I’ve had treatment and thought maybe I was “normal” for a spell, but there’s always that consequence of growing up depressed, right? I mourn it, to be truthful."

Thanks for the support! I wish you well ^_^"
depression,fe3991h,t1_fe334lx,1578847166.0,"That’s awful dude. Do you mourn the loss of all of it? I certainly do. I missed basically everything. I’m high functioning in that I learned to mask it... but yeah... 

I don’t really have memories from it either - though I remember being care free, or perhaps that was just youthful naivety."
depression,fe38htm,t3_enosxw,1578846938.0,Theyll usually ask you about your background to get you started and will guide the conversation for you if you’re struggling. You can cry

replications,fe35yup,t3_eegz9g,1578846253.0,I had a “trip” this intense from smoking plain old weed... I didn’t even smoke that much but I couldn’t even understand words for a while and became pretty detached from my body. The sky was pink and I was in tv land. Everything was tracking like this :O

depression,fe2yfu5,t3_enkkm8,1578844228.0,It’s not your fault our society values youth and despises ageing. I’m 38. And a woman. I never had beauty though but if I did I’d have used it too

depression,fe2x1jz,t3_enmd5q,1578843779.0,"Have had fluoxetine/Lovan. It differs for everyone, but I found them to be fine. The first couple of days you may feel a little lightheaded but you can start on a lower dose and work your way up if that helps.

For the record I’ve been on sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and citalopram.

citalopram was by far the best.

I have taken them since I was 18 and I’m 38 now. I’m one of the unlucky ones who has to be on them for life. 

But your doctor knows more about the body and how it works than your mother. Trust your doctor."

depression,fe2vvwy,t3_enomtx,1578843389.0,Hug her daily. Tell her how amazing you think she is. Cuddle her and pat her and let her stay in your bed if you must. Bathe her and treat her really well. Show her that she is loved. You can do this. Give her a fantastic whatever time she has left

depression,fe2u6s7,t3_enkj5q,1578842893.0,Try a K10 questionnaire - they’re used to screen - it’ll give a likely idea of if you are. If you google “K10 depression quiz” it’ll come up with it.
