fatlogic,ff7rf92,t3_es20yb,1579656541.0,"isn't this sad...like damn, this person really has been brainwashed to a point where they think it's okay to put their own health to the backburner for people who would hate her if she wasn't obese?"
fatlogic,fcswqah,t3_eibhqb,1577927048.0,"why would you even WANT to eat these foods everyday? like they're yummy foods and I enjoy them a lot, but i know for a fact if I ate them more frequently, I would grow tired of it. isn't that kinda sucky? why would you willingly take the enjoyment out of food lmao"
fatlogic,fbgas3q,t3_ed0tb5,1576842882.0,"why is it so difficult for them to be 192lbs? that is SO much weight, my friend who is 6'1 (24, male) weighs about 150lbs. he doesn't really track calories, he eats as he likes (he does have a well balanced diet though, he's korean so he eats lots of balanced meals), and he's a dancer so that's his main form of exercise, unless he doesn't have a gig, during which he will actually go to the gym for a bit. weight really isn't that hard to lose/maintain assuming you don't have an eating disorder of some sort, they're so dramatic, it pisses me off."
