relationships,ffdrr4w,t1_ffcka56,1579827312.0,"100% agree, dude works with kids, doesn’t have relationship, and uses tickling as a form of sex.  Pedos find ways to be around kids, and he wants to hang out with you and the kids instead of just you?  And his preferred form of contact is being initiated on your daughter, even after her protest...this isn’t normal.  Think of it another way, if he had a foot fetish and was trying to massage her feet, you wouldn’t second guess that as strange or predatory behavior"

dbz,ff92ug1,t1_ff8z1wz,1579703480.0,"I would say this was the best overall fight.  Goku vs Freeza is the most iconic, literally the most powerful (by leaps and bounds...outside of his family) mortal and ruler of most of the known galaxy vs a common low level warrior who against all odds fulfills an ancient alien prophecy and avenges his people, is what people think about when they think DBZ.  But all around, this was to me a better battle...the animation was for the most part top notch (the Goku Freeza fight had to be remastered and in some spots redone bc the quality wasn’t very good), the stakes were higher, if Freeza beat Goku would anything in the galaxy really change that much, meanwhile if Cell beat Gohan the Earth would have been destroyed along with countless other worlds (Freeza wanted to rule over everyone, Cell was created to destroy).  There was more filler in the Goku/Freeza fight bc it was only those two for *cough* 5 min *cough*, so we’d leave the battle to see what was going on back on Earth or at King Kais place.  Meanwhile anything that was cut to during the Gohan/Cell fight was adjacent to the battle so even in the background the fight was still going on.  And there was a sense of urgency during the Cell fight, everyone was counting on Gohan and even tried to help, while the Freeza fight had the planet disintegrating around the fighters, and somehow it still felt drawn out, I guess what I’m saying here is the pacing was better during the Cell Games.  While I enjoy Freeza more now bc of his continued story in Super, for years I thought Cell was a better villain and character altogether.  I feel like Freeza will clone himself some how in the next movie and that’s how we’ll get Cooler, but I wish Cell would come back, train with Freeza and we’ll get 2 on 2 Goku/Vegeta vs Freeza /Cell in the next movie"
