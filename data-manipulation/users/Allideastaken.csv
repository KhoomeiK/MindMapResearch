melbourne,ff9vt51,t3_esc44l,1579722603.0,Our pool looks the same!!
aww,ff8q3sf,t3_erwh76,1579691300.0,Were you in my house? I have basically that same couch and that same cat who sits the same way. I wish I had a photo.
TwoXChromosomes,ff5oqa8,t1_ff4hrvz,1579603646.0,(I'm in Australia) but I also waited until my oldest was nearly at school....then I had twins.....there went all my budget plans!!!
AskAnAmerican,ff2vlwe,t1_ff1pmlq,1579525866.0,Have you ever looked at a map of Australia?? Now we have some BIG states.
AskAnAmerican,ff2vhvc,t1_ff19x2w,1579525750.0,"Haha....still a dream for us Australians. Its a 9 hour flight JUST TO get to Singapore, then another 13 hours or so to get to London."
freefolk,ff2utzw,t1_feyoja4,1579525039.0,"At the same time, most people recommend shows while they're 'on TV' because they want someone to include in their conversations. When most shows end, recommendability wears off."
AskReddit,ff2rdeu,t3_erb7gz,1579520693.0,"Confidence. And I have no idea why. I kick ass at being a mum and don't doubt a single decision.  I've got 3 kids including baby twins and I believe in myself in every way with raising them. I'm not a mumsy type either, I dont know where it comes from.

In my professional life however, I hate the thought of having more responsibility, where I have to believe in my decisions, speaking in public makes me go red and sweaty and having a job interview is nearly soul breaking. 

I have no idea why I'm so different between the two. I was the same before I had kids too. I kinda hoped that after going through labour twice with about 15 people in the room seeing my hoo-hah would have helped me get over my fears at work, but seemingly not."
Showerthoughts,ff2bktp,t3_er27ao,1579499755.0,"It's more of a LPT than a showerthought, but yes, this is what I do and so walking the trolley back isn't a pain in the butt."
science,fewksan,t3_eqjmaw,1579412932.0,"I live in Australia. Have 3 kids, twins and a singleton. All born premature. Have spent months in hospital overall and have lots of tests and follow ups etc and it has cost me not a single cent. Totally and utterly free."
TwoXChromosomes,fewjbp9,t3_eqphay,1579411759.0,Hopefully it means you might see others' perspective on a range of other issues too.
nottheonion,femkquf,t1_felsugw,1579260458.0,Same here. Just arriving in America sounds stressful and unfriendly in every single way.
AmateurRoomPorn,fe78h90,t3_ensrs7,1578911404.0,Reminds me of Hannah's house in 'Girls'. I guess there are lots of similar apartments in Brooklyn. (Never been). Love it BTW.

parentsofmultiples,fdkzojl,t3_elthme,1578514449.0,"I've got nothing relevant to say about your bubs situation (however my small twin does have a port wine birthmark on his eye that has required some eye checks and an mri) but hope it all works out ok but just to say, my sons, born at 32+6 had significantly different weights. One at 1.475kg and one at 1.83kg. So the small one has had heaps of extra checks because he was under 1.5kg at birth  that the bigger one has never got!"
aww,fdjrgsh,t3_elkvc0,1578484728.0,There was another photo posted from the 80's recently and everyone commented on the 'brown'. Why did we all like brown so much in the 80's?? My parents had brown carpets with a red pattern and it seems it even extended to our clothes. Just a general aesthetic of brown....

thexfiles,fcmrlnk,t3_ehw12j,1577788792.0,He tried but he couldn't do it. No way GA and DD should go back to that dumpster fire.
MadeMeSmile,fcaw3ic,t3_egsnt0,1577577762.0,Great idea. Kids love pools. Doesn't matter if they're rich or poor they go nuts for whatever they have.
AskReddit,fcauors,t3_egqchb,1577576970.0,I'd be right where I am now.

CasualConversation,fc21w9y,t3_efgw4s,1577337147.0,"I'm white and my family is white so not the same obvs....but this is my experience with Chinese Tourists in Melbourne: I have the child Trifecta to the Chinese I guess....3 boys, a set of baby twins in that mix and all with orange/light hair. 
I was out in the city for a day out and we'd set up a little picnic. I was putting something in the pram then turned around and these Chinese tourists had grabbed my 5 year old son and were taking photos with him and posing his arms in different ways. My poor son was wondering what the hell was happening, I was nice enough to them, I know in their culture that giving someone space and getting permission isn't really a thing. Next thing I know, one is reaching to pick up one of my babies, I had to put my foot down at that moment and say No. They kept on insisting and asking and I kept denying them. I started to pack up and they were STILL taking photos of all of us. 
Like, I get it, different culture, but holy moly, why would anyone want photos of us, just the fascination with difference is insane."
