There isn't a ""should"" about it. That's why its so dangerous. There isn't any rationale. Theres no reasoning about it."
gaming,fd6n66d,t1_fd69elb,1578193344.0,"Why do you think I play them drunk? Lol I like them but they do get old quick and I'm not gonna sit down and play them really but they're really good for 100%ing imo.

Some of its puzzles and they are easy but I think that's kinda the point. Just casual sit down and play something mindless and semi funny.

I wouldn't mind a game where they took themselves a little more seriously. Marvel Superheroes and the Police Detective games have some really good elements to them. They're my favorite ones that I played. I like the open world element a lot. Finding all the stuff in those games is honestly fun af. I have no clue why but it's nice when you finish.

And I dont really know if they could really make a GREAT game but I'd like to see them try and come up with something serious. Itd be fun to see them aim for GOTY one year haha we might get a fantastic game

Tldr tho: I agree but there's some parts of them that I genuinely enjoy and I cant explain why"
ImGoingToHellForThis,fd3ntfy,t1_fd3m3wd,1578160096.0,"Your whole comment sounds insanely entitled wrapped up in a ""I know better than thou"" attitude. I'm not saying you are arrogant or an asshole but that's the reason I commented in the first place.

You sounded mad so I thought you were frustrated but genuinely thought it could be a copypasta then your next comment was basically ""oh, I just want to complain about the bad trump jokes people tell because I'm a great judge on what's funny or not""

Going back to your first comment, know it's real, just makes you sound like a comedy snob.

I mean I agree with you, a lot of shotty Trump jokes going around constantly but the manner and wording you used comes off as some sort of arrogant rage."
ImGoingToHellForThis,fd3lsan,t1_fd3idug,1578159559.0,He isn't coming off as an arrogant asshole tbh. You were and you're other comments keep painting that same picture.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fd3kypq,t1_fd3kjj2,1578159280.0,"Lol what? You're comments were condescending as shit, I was just matching you which would equal civil discourse.

  


Sorry you're unhappy people tell jokes, bye."
