My GP never described my depression as clinical, but I have often has a momentary ""switch"" where I was fine and then ten minutes later decided I absolutely had to kill myself with no catalyst generally."
todayilearned,ff23g6q,t1_fezxhcz,1579492756.0,"Very interesting! I'm curious about your conclusion on hanging, however. Wouldn't hanging lead to the same excruciating pain because death is also caused by the severing of the spinal cord from the brain (but from impact vs axe)?"
todayilearned,fe37m0t,t1_fe1o5px,1578846726.0,"Ah, more bias. How about actual studies?
Here, I'll leave this article for you which links to several studies that back up my point. Not that I expect you will read them when you're this deep into believing your own personal bias. But just incase someone else is reading...

todayilearned,fdy0ct3,t1_fdvvm2q,1578774705.0,Backspits into the nipple?! Lmao do you have a source for this?
todayilearned,fdxyg9x,t1_fdx45e7,1578774208.0,Yikes. God forbid someone want bodily autonomy....
todayilearned,fdxxxsx,t1_fdxkq20,1578774040.0,"Yes. This is true with most of the studies showing benefits of breastfeeding over formula feeding. They did not control for socio economic status.  Plenty of studies are now showing the benefits of breastfeeding have been overstated. But the original research was pushed so hard, that the breast is best campaign has been drilled into mothers heads, along with the fact that low income mothers are pushed to breastfeed to save money on WIC."
todayilearned,fdxwq9s,t1_fdwy7a8,1578773711.0,What an awful thing to suggest.  Women don't need to try breastfeeding before formula. Fed is best. And that can mean for the mothers mental health. No one has to try breastfeeding and most of what you've said in this thread is only backed up by lactivists and not hard science. Formula is nearly identical to breast milk outside if the immunity protections of the first few months. There are zero long term benefits to breastfeeding.
todayilearned,fdxvmmj,t1_fdvwtrf,1578773404.0,"Ugh thank you! The number of upvotes on that comment is alarming. There has been a ton of research over the last few years showing the benefits of breast milk have been overstated.  Formula is SO close to breast milk, pretty much lacking only in the short term antibodies breast milk provides... But breast milk lacks adequate vitamin D, so neither is perfect."

Dogtraining,fdfkcdi,t1_fdf5vdj,1578363717.0,This makes sense. I think I'll try that. Thank you!
Dogtraining,fdfka6a,t1_fdf8ht7,1578363678.0,"Thanks! No, she isn't pooping more often. She's has one or two accidents in the house before but not in her crate outside of this frequency.

I'll try your suggestions and taking to the vet. Thank you!"
beyondthebump,fcxvopc,t1_fcxlcvm,1578071202.0,"While I don't agree with your perspective on this issue, I just wanted to say I admire the way you approached this and responded even when in the minority. It's refreshing to see a disagreement on the internet handled with grace and self reflection."
beyondthebump,fcxot1m,t3_ejf4ed,1578067983.0,"Oh gosh

- Labor wasn't at all what I expected or wanted. I didn't have contractions, it was just constant pain. I felt unprepared for that. Labor turned into an emergency and I needed interventions which made me feel completely out of control. It's had a big impact on my anxiety and lack of desire for another child.

- Reconnecting with my husband is a struggle. We both want baby time. We both want hobby/alone time. It doesn't leave a lot of time for ""us"" which we have to make more of an effort to do. Thankfully, we have a strong relationship. But it's been hard.

- Poops. And not in like the, ""ew it smells"" sense.  For weeks and weeks my kiddo would only go like once or twice a week and it was so much it was a huge production and always a blowout. She still takes huge poops but is more regular... Except it always ends up in her labia. Not sure what I was expecting just not that much spread haha

- Strained relationship with in laws. I've been struggling with resentment toward my MIL since baby was born. She's an excited first time grandma, but has some issues with boundaries.  Every holiday she sends us a ""baby's first"" outfit.... Which is frustrating because she doesn't ask, and assumes we don't have something we want her in, and then gets upset when we don't put her in clothes she buys. She has made comments about be going back to work and how bad daycare is.... We had a good relationship before but now I just find myself so angry at her for how insensitive she is.


Those are the big ones."
beyondthebump,fcxnoc4,t1_fcxmyl0,1578067256.0,Thank you for this perspective!
beyondthebump,fcxltkq,t1_fcxldv4,1578066036.0,"Thank you for saying this.  I think making the most of our time together is going to be a focus for me. I love the idea of no tv, putting the phones away. Thank you!"
beyondthebump,f1rvb1g,t1_f1p77lt,1569720642.0,Thank you for posting this. Not OP but FTM of a three week old. I've been so worried I'm causing permanent harm if I can't soothe her or figure out what is wrong quickly.
