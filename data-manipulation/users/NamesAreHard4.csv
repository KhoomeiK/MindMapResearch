AskDrugNerds,fgkdpkv,t1_fgkdfik,1580863167.0,Because Seroquel has serotonergic activity you run some risk of serotonin syndrome if you combine it with DXM. Higher doses of the Seroquel = more risk; higher doses of the DXM = more risk.
AskDrugNerds,fgkd0c3,t3_ez06fy,1580862707.0,"The overwhelming majority of people going through withdrawal from medications tried to go cold turkey, which is not advisable for drugs you've been taking for a long time. Your body is expecting to get the medication and has adapted to it, so you've got to wean off in order to let things readjust more smoothly, or you will suffer dearly for it. Usually drugs with very long half-lives are the exceptions to this rule because they essentially taper themselves. It takes so long for the body to get rid of these drugs that the brain can adjust gradually to not receiving as much of the drug without you needing to taper off.

It doesn't really matter how it compares to heroin withdrawal in ""severity"". The withdrawal syndromes are different between the two drugs for one, and two: severity varies between individuals for each drug (i.e. Risperdal withdrawal may not be the same in severity as it is for you, and the same is true of Heroin) and depends on the dose of the drug taken as well as the length of time it was taken for. And perhaps the severity of the underlying illness the drug was intended to treat."

todayilearned,fgjs7pv,t1_fgjpiw0,1580850365.0,"Okay hold up, you don’t have to insult my character bc it seemed to me you were one of these people who didn't grow up around people addicted to alcohol or drugs and were stigmatizing those who have been / are going through that struggle. I was basically trying to socially protect people like you/us. People who’ve been through that don’t need the stigma of the ignorant outside world. I didn’t mean to insult your character, I was just saying it looks like you don’t know what you’re talking about. But you do. And it’s okay that you said what you said bc I understand what it seemed like when you read my comment. We’re on the same side, don’t worry.

However I will say it’s not the same for everyone. I grew up in a small town where a lot of people get addicted to drugs bc there’s nothing to do out there and a lot of poverty and mental illness; both my parents were addicted to multiple drugs including alcohol, my brother is addicted to alcohol and I was addicted to a drug as well. I’ve lost friends to drugs and addiction. It varies but some people lose the cravings for whatever drug they were addicted to (less common for nicotine, very unfortunately). And some people acquire the ability to control themselves and others don’t. I know people who can drink socially who were addicted and are ok. Takes experimenting with low amounts until you get a little buzz and some friends to keep you under wraps and keep you occupied. But if it’s too much of a risk for you definitely don’t worry about what I’ve seen work. Personally I’ve never really gotten addicted to alcohol but I used to use it heavily and got myself in some very big health trouble so since that happened to me early on it was enough to keep me from ever drinking too much again / drinking too regularly. Now I can just drink a little wine and be fine. With the drug I was addicted to I also know I’ll probably use a lot of it in a given session if I do use it but there are times that I can just get a little / reasonably high and not go too far. But I don’t keep it around my house bc I know I can’t control it. And I don’t crave it often, luckily. To me that’s an impulsiveness problem. The cravings I consider akin to cravings for cookies or something— I know I’m not addicted but yeah it’s pleasurable and it’s okay if I want it sometimes. But yeah I’m pretty darn impulsive and always do high doses of drugs when I use them except alcohol now, and I’m impulsive in a whole lot of other areas of my life. Maybe that’s similar for you?"

I tried to be a server and had trouble with finding out I had left out important details in customers' orders and had to go back to ask what they'd wanted which made me look very bad. It's not like I don't understand the order. It's just that I have 0 chance of being able to remember it without writing it down, and I just have a lot of trouble in writing it down while ignoring all the other things going on in my head and while trying to focus on the task at hand instead of the things going on around me in a busy restaurant.

ADHD,fghwps7,t1_fggns2r,1580796224.0,"One of the reasons why BPD isn't considered a subtype of Bipolar is that the neurobiology between them are not similar. The medications that work for Bipolar don't work for them in quite the same way they work for BPD. In Bipolar with something like Lamictal you might see a decrease in the frequency/severity of manic/depressive episodes (particularly the depressive ones) which are pretty much the main causes of their problems as far as I know. People with BPD have issues like emotional over-reactivity \*(different from Bipolar episodes in which the episodes ""turn on"" one day for no apparent reason and can last for varying periods of time)\* especially due to negative events, impulsiveness, and anger pretty much all the time and these are some of the symptoms that Lamictal can help out with. So, behaviorally, the main difference is the cyclical nature of Bipolar, as well as BPD's tendency to ""split"", i.e. idealize and devaluate other people. And BPD's intense self-loathing and perpetual identity crises that certainly don't have a cyclical nature.

I have BPD and ADHD too btw. It's kinda cool to me to see other people with both. We experience life through a similar lens."
ADHD,fghu7ef,t1_fghqpfx,1580793996.0,"You could try to ask them about Kapvay or Intuniv. These medications work synergistically with stimulants and reduce heart rate. They're also FDA approved for ADHD. However, doctors can sometimes prefer to adjust the stimulant rather than add another medication because you never know if the additional medication will also cause side effects, so I think that's why your doctor decided to take your dose down rather than bring these drugs up. However, they can be pretty nice, especially for sleeping. Maybe see what they think?"
UNC,fghqhsi,t3_eyfz56,1580791054.0,"Freshmen can be that way. In freshman year they're all stoked about all the cool things they did to get here and think they're great. By senior year you've been humbled by your coursework here and other experiences. But we do recognize we go to a great school with a lot of opportunities and a great reputation and we will sometimes allude to that and it can come off the wrong way sometimes. So for example, if I went to UNC's Med school (I don't), I would definitely be happy that I didn't ""end up"" at any of the other medical schools in the state and it's possible that I might say that in the presence of someone who went to one of those other schools, though I don't mean to offend anyone. I'm just appreciating my hardwork and luck to the extent that luck applies. But it can very understandably hurt people's feelings.

&#x200B;

Because of this general issue, when we talk about these accomplishments to people who for whatever reason do not chase after ambitions much and maybe are comfortable with a more stable life, we can come off as jerks. Travel's a big one-- if you talk about how you've been to a bunch of cool places, a lot of people will take it as bragging. And ambitious people do tend to like to travel (though not always of course). It can be hard to even communicate those super cool experiences without sounding like you're bragging because we culturally associate travel so closely with socioeconomic status (perhaps because the correlation isn't an insignificant one). But again we don't really mean to hurt anyone. What would be the point of going out of our way to achieve things if we couldn't celebrate them? Must we then not share our cool experiences to people who we'd actually quite like to share them with (answer's yes in a fair number of circumstances)? In any case I'm sure this applies to students at other good schools too and I imagine they may have similar reputations."

smashbros,fgh3nio,t1_fgh1nc5,1580775925.0,"When I was growing up using “them” as a singular pronoun was actually incorrect. So our instructors told us not to say that and you came off as less educated / dumb if you did. The English style guides that decree what is correct English (e.g. MLA, Chicago, the same names of the citation formats you might be familiar with) had not adopted the word “them” as a gender-neutral pronoun until the past couple years actually, which is why a lot of authors would use their own gender pronoun to refer to a gender-neutral character. Recognition of gender-neutral people and non-binary genders wasn’t normal either. It’s not like it would have been a bad thing (at least to people who are open to the idea of non-binary genders) but nobody was conditioned to do it. So yeah it kinda just feels weird to refer to “them” as “her” bc of that conditioning. Either way it’s benign and doesn’t hurt anything regardless of what pronoun you use.

psychology,fggj60p,t1_fggat4r,1580762969.0,"I don’t think we have enough clear evidence to make a determination on whether these things can cure a real case of genetically-mediated MDD as compared to depressions caused by prolonged stress which might be more likely to be alleviated by things like this. Besides, while we know these things help reduce inflammation we don’t know about where exactly in the brain they help that if at all. I’m sure there are a handful of studies but I’m also sure the science is inconclusive because when you go to your doc and say you have depression they don’t tell you these things are particularly likely to solve your problem. It may be the case that SSRIs are particularly effective in reducing inflammation in the brain and pharmacological treatments are required to address the full extent of the brain inflammation behind depression bc while they don’t work for everyone, the evidence shows they work better than anything else (except therapy in a good number of cases which underscores the need to segment the population based on who must receive a drug to treat depression vs who can respond to therapy vs both). But your suggestions could indeed turn out to help enough to be sufficient. Or we may need to use combos of that + medications + therapy. There’s still a ton to figure out about depression as there are so many moving pieces as they say in this talk. Depression doesn’t show itself the same way for everyone. Therefore the treatment will have to vary based on individuals’ needs."

It is certainly conceivable biologically, but the frontier of cannabis research doesn’t seem to acknowledge this idea so I’m skeptical. In this case all you’re really seeing is that there’s another compound in some strains / samples of weed with a much higher affinity than THC for the receptors THC binds to. It says in the article they don’t even know if it activates the receptor. So it could actually be true that this drug blocks the receptor and therefore blocks any effect THC could have. It could also be in such low concentrations in most bud that it does not produce any behavioral effects regardless of its efficacy and its function as an agonist or antagonist.

worldnews,fgfy5qb,t3_ey5vuu,1580750162.0,"There’s a difference between potency and efficacy which these articles that talk about how certain drugs are x times more “powerful” than a more popular drug in the same class (i.e. Fentanyl vs Heroin) utterly fail to explain nearly every time. When they make these statements they’re always actually referring to potency. So this drug is 30x more potent than THC. So that means 30mg THC = 1mg of this drug. The absolute maximum effect (refers to efficacy rather than potency) either drug could cause however depends on those drugs themselves and may not actually differ meaningfully. So you could have a cannabinoid that produces THC-like effects with 30x potency compared to THC but it may not be capable of making you “higher” than the maximum of what THC is capable of regardless of how much of it you take. You could take 100mg of this 30x more potent cannabinoid and it wouldn’t necessarily make you higher than the max effect of THC. It could also be capable of producing an even stronger maximum intensity of effects, or weaker. It might actually be nice to have a far more potent cannabinoid that has significantly less efficacy so you get maybe to the medium level of highness that THC can cause without having to use a lot of the substance itself relative to how much weed you’d have to smoke to get to that level. These stupid articles never get as far as discussing this though, partially because it can be a lot harder to extrapolate from quantitative efficacy data to behavioral phenotypes. Moral of the story: just be an informed consumer of information.

Edit: wow, the article does indeed mention potency vs efficacy although the title of the OP and the article title itself misconstrues the actual meaning of the article for clickbait. Nonetheless, the above info is important for you to know when reading these articles"

How do you manage the dosing? Do you take it everyday? I keep hearing people generally will avoid taking it on some days (i.e. weekends) so that their tolerance to the medication can ""reset"", so that when you take it, it retains more of its benefits. And do you take both an extended release version as well as instant release for ""boosters""? Lastly, do you notice a crash?

ADHD,ffzahqn,t1_ffy39gu,1580369621.0,"I agree with pretty much everything you've said. I would just want to note that after reading your response and thinking about it + my case, I am leaning more toward the hyperfocus + saturation hypothesis for the video games and music, while the food may just be a self-soothing / impulsive behavior related more to BPD. On the broad psychopathology test I took when I got my ADHD testing done, I did have statistically significant but mild scores for the obsessive trait as you said (and comfortably significant scores for BPD), so again you hit the nail on the head. With respect to ""needing sameness"", I happen to have a friend with Asperger's so I think I have seen this in real life, and I think that's not quite what's going on for me. I am a pretty impulsive and spontaneous person, and I don't need consistency to feel content, though better structure in my life would probably be a lot healthier for me with respect to my ADHD issues. Nonetheless you helped me disambiguate those other issues I talked about from splitting, which is much appreciated.

DrugNerds,ffy16x0,t1_ffxuo2n,1580336520.0,"One problem you should be made aware of if you are seeking ketamine infusion treatment or just on a conceptual basis is that virtually all research on ketamine used in depression has shown that its antidepressive action is *transient,* including this paper. This means that the effect is temporary. If I recall correctly, most research finds about a 2 week period of significant antidepressive action from a single administration. This paper is using the assumption of 1 week in its experiments.

It will definitely take a very long time to figure out depression. So many neurotransmitter systems are probably involved, agonism/antagonism at certain receptor subtypes can paradoxically result in the same effect, not all agonists of the same receptor subtype are the same due to biased agonism and for other reasons, a drug can be both an agonist as well as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) AND exclusively be either an agonist or PAM with respect to a different type of measurement used to measure cell activity and... so much more. We've got a long way to go.

Anecdotally I also tried a bunch of antidepressants and other drugs and have done so for many years now, and it seems Fluvoxamine works well for me. Could be worth looking into, ya never know"
AskDrugNerds,ffxyu6e,t3_evqcop,1580335113.0,"A lot of drug design is based on ""high-throughput screening"" in which they basically have a massive number of cell cultures expressing different receptors and they use a machine to administer drugs to determine which receptors a given drug binds to, called ""hits"". There is still drug design more along the lines of what you're describing but my understanding is that there is much less of that going on. 

Nonetheless, there are papers that go into exactly what manner a drug changes the conformation of the receptor, the parts of the drug responsible for eliciting the conformational change, as well as the resultant intracellular events. If you're interested in psychedelic research, I have a paper bookmarked that is an extremely long and detailed review of the state of psychedelic research as of 2016 that goes into what you're looking for in great detail if you would like me to link it. Regardless it is a very good example of what you are looking for."

If they turn you away for that, they clearly don’t care about you and instead they care much more about themselves and imposing their view on the world. They also would likely turn you away / dump you later if you happened to do something else they didn’t like in particular. Those people are just liabilities. There are plenty of people out there who do give things like ADHD respect and have some humility. Just takes time to find them. Being near generally colleges helps"
