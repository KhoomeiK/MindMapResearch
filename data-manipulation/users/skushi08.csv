science,ffn7llz,t1_ffjwmtq,1580062847.0,"Thats weird. FEMA flood maps here in Houston definitely take elevation into consideration. Flood maps nicely follow logical contour intervals areas were also surprisingly accurate during major flooding events like Harvey, at least for direct bayou caused flooding. Street flooding is a whole other issue all together though."
science,ffn6ezi,t1_ffjx96y,1580062524.0,The one thing this doesnt seem to take into consideration is that people wont just migrate to the nearest city. Theres a combination of job market and cultural factors as well that will come into play. Memphis shares a lot of cultural similarities to New Orleans so it makes sense theyd see a large influx of New Orleans refugees.
science,ffn4rxm,t1_ffmpw2t,1580062080.0,"I did read most of the actual journal article. Blue as used in the linked summary figure are counties directly impacted by SLR. The white through red color scale indicates incoming residents. Its two color scales in one which is a poor way to visualize this data. Theres a binary blue not-blue then a red gradient. 

Whats not well described or indicated is that you can have impacted residents in those counties that relocate to the cities well above the SLR  zone within the blue colored counties. Maybe they understand the concept of elevations adjacent to the ocean, what is apparent is theyre pretty bad at making a map to fully represent the message theyre conveying.

County level is also a poor resolution to view this information. The directly impact will likely only those that live within the first mile or much less depending on what coastline youre looking at."

Other even more blatant ones like were all out at the pool and hey the hotel room is empty now we should sneak off and go take a nap. Then proceed to take her up on it and literally go take a nap.

mildlyinteresting,ffjotul,t1_ffjexo9,1580003240.0,If you think of the tent as a hotel cost then $50 isnt very bank breaking. I can definitely scrounge up a multi-use tent that comfortably sleeps 3 for around $100. Hotel on a vacation to any sort of decent destination will easily run you $150+ /night.

UpliftingNews,ffiu4lb,t1_ffi46fk,1579982775.0,"My biggest complaint is our small neighborhood library is only open after 5 one night a week and has terrible weekend hours. I use it a lot, but we can only make it once a week at most with our son at that location. I grew up with the huge county library in my hometown so I was used to libraries staying open late and being research quality. My first experience with a small local branch left me doing a lap to see where everything else was and then being shooed out at 5 on a weeknight."
UpliftingNews,ffitsb6,t1_ffhym9z,1579982529.0,"Anecdotally, my family definitely uses the library a lot, and were in a high income household. While we own a small libraries worth of books for ourselves and our son, kids books get old quickly. The library is a great way to supplement what he has for variety without cluttering up bookshelves more. Find one he loves then well buy it. My wife and I also just order books online to be picked up so that its a quick in and out exercise for us to grab a new book for the week. 

I think in large part it depends on the value people place on reading. For some poor people its just a free form of entertainment. For our family and many others its a great way to broaden your horizons and read material you might otherwise just pass by."
UpliftingNews,ffisvz9,t1_ffi035k,1579981885.0,"Most new movies make it to streaming within a few months these days. If my wife and I were to go to the theater were looking at $25+ for tickets plus the cost of a sitter. Even more if we get any sort of food or snacks. Or we can wait 2 months and just buy it for less than the cost of both our tickets. 

Some theaters are on the right track and realize they need more than the traditional experience to draw you in. Lounge seating and sit down menu service is a decent start. The issue with the nice theaters is they still fall short on drinks and or food. Food is still a glorified Applebees menu at places like studio movie grill or even IPIC. If you draw me in with a nice meal and seats at under $75/person, then it might become a worthy date destination. By nice I also mean nothing better have come out of a freezer into a microwave or high speed convection oven."

That being said, a friend had a bottle of mellow corn out for New Years and no one else would touch it. Ended up finishing half the bottle myself. I would be all over a single barrel offering."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffgdlmp,t1_ffg34zi,1579903878.0,Building management doesnt need court admissible evidence to do something about a resident that steals packages or if theyre not a resident to deal with loitering/trespassing.

funny,fff3hp7,t1_fff14h0,1579874708.0,Its not a very small group. A similar group would be a large number of hippies I knew in college. Theyd complain about the environment and the man while flying around to music festivals and summering from second homes. The no self awareness hippy.
funny,fff2vbf,t1_fff1ou6,1579874219.0,That was my hardest transition. I never had to work for good grades then went to a top 20 university and got my ass kicked at first.

baseball,ff8x0od,t1_ff87w00,1579698859.0,"Grew up outside NY during the 90s so have always been a Yankee/Jeter fan. Moved to Houston about a decade ago when they were terrible and in the National league. I loved watching baseball so I occasionally just picked up cheap tickets to watch the games. I grew to love them since I figured they were bad and would likely never have to face the Yankees in the post season, at least not frequently. They were my adopted team. Altuve was a gritty hard working up and comer that I had so much respect for. When we had our son he was such a huge Altuve fan. For some reason any time he sees a picture of him, Correa or Gerrit Cole he just shouts their name in excitement. This whole fiasco has just left me mad at them. I feel betrayed for cheering their rise to the top after Harvey hit the city."

They last longer than typical shoes even if you dont rotate them, and theyre comfy as hell compared to anything thats not a sneaker. The restoration service really is magic if you wear them out. They look brand new again for like a hundred bucks. Ive got a pair of cordovans that are my daily drivers. One day a week Ill rotate in a pair of black factory seconds. Key is to pick up during sales and good seconds finds. Plus if you buy conservative styles that will stay in style forever youre good to go. 

Ive only owned three pairs and two lasted my the past 10 years of my professional working career. For a brief window I wore a pair from their travel series, but those are comparatively crap."

politics,ff680my,t1_ff5t917,1579621311.0,"I think examples like this are a good case for campaign reform. Campaign and election seasons should be limited like they are in many countries. Not like the US where after one election is done folks start declaring their intent to run in the next. 

Campaign reform shouldnt need to just be limited to money and financing. I want it to also protect the collective sanity of the entire population subjected to one continuous campaign and election cycle/loop."

At least where I am in the US many completely disregard all traffic signs and lights when theyre required to follow all the same motor vehicle laws as drivers. Since I also like cycling with my family I hate it more because theyre the ones that cause drivers to be irrationally mad at everyone else on a bike. 

Side note, I love that your crossing guards are called lollipop men. Crossing guards are some of the most genuinely caring people Ive come across so for some reason that name suits them. Theyre always waving here with a smile on their face. Growing up one of ours in my small town was hit and killed by a distracted driver.

Family in need of good education and healthcare options isnt conducive to that lifestyle. If youre single with no ties or plans to ever have a family then by all means it could work. You also have to consider the fact if anything goes wrong youre screwed. Its not like when youre in your 50s or 60s youre coming back to the west doing anything other than minimum wage labor.

Whether its not wanting to open where people have less money to spend, or the increasing crime rates in poverty stricken areas.

Not that I dont believe you, but do you have any sources to back up that claim? Dont many countries with M4A also regulate prices? That seems like the only way to prevent runaway profiteering and cost increases to the programs. If its regulated then that cost of doing business cant be passed on to the healthcare system.

Theyd have to keep the tax increase under 2.5% to manage that. Then unless the savings my employer realizes translates over to salary raises, theres very little chance its a net positive for me or most folks I work with. My hope is that it were to be combined with cost reform and regulated pricing at the same time, because thats really what causes runaway cost increases. 

However, universal healthcare is necessary. Too many people are suffering not going to a doctor because they cant even afford to let their healthcare, if they have it at all, kick in.

Not that I don’t believe you, but do you have any sources to back up that claim? Don’t many countries with M4A also regulate prices? That seems like the only way to prevent runaway profiteering and cost increases to the programs. If it’s regulated then that cost of doing business can’t be passed on to the healthcare system.

Then unless the savings my employer realizes translates over to salary raises, there’s very little chance it’s a net positive for me or most folks I work with. My hope is that it were to be combined with cost reform and regulated pricing at the same time, because that’s really what causes runaway cost increases. 

However, universal healthcare is necessary. Too many people are suffering not going to a doctor because they can’t even afford to let their healthcare, if they have it at all, kick in.

GetMotivated,fcziyac,t1_fczik20,1578102265.0,I think the differentiator is listening to pop top 40 or not. That’s the gist I’m getting from a lot of comments.
GetMotivated,fczicld,t1_fczdtj4,1578101895.0,"There’s a difference in the type of venues you go to and the type of music you may listen to on the radio between your mid 20s and mid 30s. 

33M here. I’ve probably heard a Lizzo song but couldn’t name it or tell you it’s her if I heard it start playing. However, I do know the entire Disney discography and can probably tell you after a few bars what song it is, what movie it’s from, and what character sings it."
houston,fczapam,t1_fcygi15,1578097106.0,Isn’t that kind of how next door works? It’s classic bystander psychology. Someone goes on there complains about something/asks if anyone else has seen such and such. Lots of people will say “call the constable or police”. Then unless the OP does call everyone else assumes it’s been addressed.

Futurology,fcxk2dm,t1_fcxf2l8,1578064854.0,In the US we have a lot of forestry services that have been gutted for budget over the years. Historically they also do controlled burns to help with fire management. Controlled burns help you prevent uncontrolled events like this and those we’ve seen in the States in recent years. It also doesn’t help that as suburbs around cities expand they’re expanding into at risk zones for natural disasters and exacerbating a lot of the local problems.
Futurology,fcxhgw7,t1_fcx9x40,1578063034.0,"I don’t build climate models, but I do build geologic models for a living. Long story short without going into deep details, all models you build will be wrong because you’re working problems with way more than even a few variables of uncertainty. However, some of the better models will still give you an idea of a range of possible outcomes. Should you take end member cases and assume that will be the outcome? No. These models also aren’t taking singular outcomes as their “prediction”. Those predictions are usually based on a statistical distribution of that range of possible outcomes. All that said, headlines and average people are bad about taking end member cases and painting them as the outcome."

CFB,fcwoumr,t1_fcw7ytx,1578031997.0,"Honestly, I get where they’re coming from. It’s chicken shit, but I get their logic. We were a 6-6 team without our star running back or our QB1, with an interim head coach that only has 4 years of college position coaching experience. A receivers coach no less, and it’s not like we’re known for our top talent receivers. 

On top of that, we were playing a team that was arguably better than their ranking indicated. With where the program currently is very little positive can come out of a blowout against a G5 team."

CFB,fcvsy8i,t3_ej2gj0,1578009393.0,I definitely understand why the AD said that Rich Gunnel wouldn’t even be interviewing for the head coaching job even though he was named the interim head coach. Nobody on the field or sideline looks like they want to be there right now.
CFB,fcvrta4,t1_fcvrht3,1578008658.0,Wonder if it’s the actual bands. I went to BC vs Arizona in Shreveport a few years back. Arizona hired a local band and gave them all Arizona sweatshirts to play.

The New Orleans bowl is a fine game for a Sun Belt champ. The issue is the lower level tie in with Conference USA. CUSA and Sun Belt are arguably about the same level even though historically CUSA has been viewed as the stronger conference. I think Sun Belt champ vs CUSA champ would be fair."
