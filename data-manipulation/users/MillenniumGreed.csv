PowerTV,fff79mg,t3_etb6z2,1579877498.0,"I imagine you're probably in a solid minority.

Honestly, I never liked Tariq's character. And I especially hate how he turned into the ""new Ghost"". All these attempts at making him into some bonafide gangster when he wasn't born into that life is annoying. Ghost is literally the smartest character in this show. Wants to go legit and save the people he cares about so that they can avoid things like Raina's death. Yet these last few episodes made him seem like he's some evil monster with no redeemable qualities.

I see it as no coincidence that the show took a turn for the worse once Tariq started getting more attention. And for the record, I have no issue with Tariq in theory - the idea of him going the opposite path in terms of characterization from his dad (becoming a more evil person as opposed to his dad becoming a better person) was something I thought could be cool. But like with any idea, the execution is soooo important. And in this show's case, the execution was sloppy."

Blackfellas,fdqgzqi,t3_emqrlj,1578666435.0,"You wanna know what else is bullshit? How people say ""you talk White"", when White people clearly aren't the only ones who speak like this. I mean, I've known Asians and Latinos who more or less have the same manner of speaking as White people do, and I've never heard someone say ""you talk Orange/Yellow"" or whatever. Cause clearly White people have a monopoly on everything.

These same White people love telling you you don't act like a Black person. At the same time...isn't that a gigantic self drag? I once heard some White kid who I was cool with at some point say about himself: ""I act so Black"". Damn. You realize you only insult yourself when you try to act entirely different?

Same White people don't care for Black issues. They see Black people as tokens. They love our culture, but only on a surface level so they can say nigga without hesitation and get ""cool points"" for dating Black men/women.

IWantToLearn,fdk9p5p,t3_eltxgk,1578499239.0,"The goal, in my opinion at least, should be to have meaningful, engaging conversations. Not just conversations with just anyone. The truth is, some people you probably just can’t have a good conversation with. You’ve heard it in breakups, but it’s also true with a lot of other things: “it’s not you, it’s me”. But it might not just be you. It could be them.

With that being said, I’d try to find a balance of asking questions and redirecting things to you. I know you said you’d prefer something else - this is about as good as it gets without doing something drastically different. Ask them a question, let them talk for a while, and then dependent on what they talk about, find a way to relate your own experiences to what was just said. 

Examples being if the person went through a breakup, and you have as well. Then you try to relate what was said to your own experiences with breakups. 

I’d also say that the human race is not some homogeneous species. This sort of ties into what I said before about not being able to have meaningful conversations with everyone; since some people are just far too different. You may be an athlete, they may be the complete opposite of anything resembling athletic. 

Even as far as related hobbies are concerned - you may be a basketball fan, they may be a football fan. 

You may love playing video games, they may love reading books. 

I wouldn’t stress over stuff like this too much, though. Everyone’s different. 

Last tip would be to read as much as possible, about as many topics as possible. This will help make you a well rounded conversationalist."

selfimprovement,fcu97fb,t3_eixloq,1577975543.0,"I think change is tough. Some changes you can make abruptly, others will take more time. From what little research I've seen, you're forming new habits, and your brain has to be desensitized to become adjusted to it.

You might need to change gradually. Start by taking one step, one bad habit at a time. Eventually, this will add up.

I've had trouble with: junk food, masturbation, porn, sleeping in, social media, and soda. I've quit one or more of them, and then relapsed. You just have to dust yourself off and start over again.

As for not being afraid of what comes next...that's not something I'm sure ever goes away. Just like your brain has to get used to new behaviors, this is a skill that has to be practiced. More than likely, you're not exposing yourself to enough, and this makes it difficult to move forward regardless. Don't let you being afraid control you. Instead, you need to control it. Because in reality? You never really know much for sure. Nothing is guaranteed in life. You just have to hope for the best and get used to the rhyme and rhythm of life as we know it."

IWantToLearn,fcn4zth,t3_ei12lt,1577803418.0,"Remember that there's a time and a place for almost everything, including your own feelings, and yes, including the truth. The problem with people who lack tact is that for one, they insert their unnecessary thoughts and observations in situations where people could have lived their entire lives without hearing what they had to say.

A classic example: ""you've gained weight"". You'd be surprised at how people think this is an appropriate greeting. Is it true that the person's gained weight? Yes. Does that mean you had to point it out? No. The truth hurts. So when you think about it, the truth is a weapon. And when do we use weapons? Ideally, only to protect ourselves or other people. You're mad at the gun that killed someone you cared about, but if it saved the person you cared about, you'd love it. You generally only point out things like that if someone asked. And even then then, it doesn't have to be rude or come off as rude.

""Hey, do you think I've gained weight?""

""Yes.""

As straightforward as it gets, but doesn't rub salt in the wounds. Remember - it's not just about what you do say, but what you don't say.

The aforementioned situation without tact:

""Hey, do you think I've gained weight?""

""Yes, you look like a fucking bloated whale.""

The point being? There's a difference between using the truth to help, and using the truth to hurt on purpose or without context. Context, diction, intention, and tone. Keep these in mind. Diction is important because you don't want to seem more abrasive than you are. Which is why when I tell the truth, I don't curse or add any other unnecessary language. Lastly, try to communicate in person - doing it in text will leave the tone ambiguous. It's not just what you say, but how you say it.

It's been said the definition of tact is telling your enemy to go to hell in a way they look forward to the trip.

Other things that come to mind: try not to start out your communication in an attacking way. As u/ZentraliTee mentioned, take responsibility for your words by starting out your sentences with ""I think..."" or ""I feel..."" or ""I noticed..."". Small stuff like that comes to mind. It's also a matter of the five W's, one H: who, what, when, where, why, and how."
