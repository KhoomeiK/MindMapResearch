You'll gain insights into how to make your own decks better and you'll find ways to build your decks to disrupt the decks everyone else is playing.

I'm glad you put it that way. The fun I get out of games, whether it's MTG, an mmo, or a game like torchlight or diablo, is from creating my own character, deck, or technique. I'll take a look at meta decks so I can learn techniques and bring that to my deck. Thanks for your response. This is really helping."
MagicArena,ffx86m1,t1_ffx6ypg,1580319769.0,"First off, thanks a lot for your detailed response. Lot to think about. 

>Do you play any cards that help smooth out your draws, your mana, or both?

Don't quite know what you mean by smooth out my draws or mana. I have a couple deadly visits that surveil two and a 6/6 flying demon that allows me to pay two life and surveil two, but they are expensive. I don't have any fancy artifacts that are mana related. It's just the lands that enter tapped and give either a white or black and a few other special lands, but the rest are basic.

When I say that I get ""bad"" cards, I mean good cards, but no lands to play them. I tried to balance the split between low cost and expensive cards, but it's not rare for me to get a hand with 1 land and all cards costing 4 mana or more, mulligan and still only have one land. Then I'll go 3 turns without a land. I have 26 lands, but it still happens often."
MagicArena,ffx1tit,t3_eufmqi,1580315934.0,"How often should a decent deck win and how often should I have ""bad"" cards in my hand (even after the mulligan)? I'm new to arena (casually played edh for the last year with a couple friends) and am having a lot of fun just creating my own decks with the cards I have (only been playing a couple weeks). I have what I call my black and white murder deck, which has a lot of cards that destroy creatures or enchantments and some good creatures to finish the job (low cost creatures have death touch and I have some interesting heavy hitters). My other main deck (black and white again) is based around life gain triggering +1/+1 counters. They're both a lot of fun and I win probably 65% of the games I play. 3 out of 5 loses are because I am having bad luck with the cards. The other 2 are because the opponent simply played better. I have 26 lands in my murder deck, but will still have games where I start with 1 or 2 lands and don't get another until turn 5. Is all of this normal or is it my decks? I would kill for some advice on my decks, but won't use meta decks people post online (most of my enjoyment in MTG comes from making my own deck and adjusting it as I play).

Edit: When I said I wont use meta decks (i don't know the jargon), I meant I won't copy an exact deck someone posted online (I will learn from their strategies though). I'm not against using meta strategies. Basically my joy in MTG comes from creating my own deck (with some help of course) and copy and pasting someone else's card for card takes away from that (I'm not saying there's anything wrong with copying meta deks, just that it's not for me)."
