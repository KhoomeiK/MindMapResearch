aww,fdr2h6y,t1_fdr16tf,1578678615.0,"AKC does not set the standards for breeds, dog clubs do and tell the AKC what is allowed. Most every single breed has a governing body made up of owners and breeders who vote on the direction a breed will take. They set the standards for what is allowed and not allowed for a dog to be considered pure within that breed.

New breeds can form when a group forms to govern the direction, establish the standard, close their stud books, and have a well defined and unique dog breed."
aww,fdr1mi0,t1_fdr0u96,1578678309.0,"You have your opinions but facts are facts. The Labrador breed was established and stud books closed January of 1916 and the only accepted colors were the 3, silver not being one. More than enough genetic results have been published establishing that the genetic makeup required to produce silvers did not exist in the Labrador breed until introduced through cross breeding in the 1950s. The only way to add silver as the 4th color is the LRC to approve it."
aww,fdr18ir,t1_fdqyp0u,1578678107.0,"Genetically they are not pure labs. Silvers were made in the 1950s and are the result of cross breeding with Weimaraner dogs. This introduced the ""d"" color gene which had never existed in the Labrador breed post stud books closing on January 1, 1916. Silvers, charcoals, and other variant colors, while cute, are a scourge upon the purity of well established Labrador bloodlines."

Per AKC and LRC governing bodies there are only 3 colors of Labrador and silver is not an accepted color, though the AKC lets it slide by registering silvers as chocolate."

Per my doctor and pharmacist friends the prescribed Meth is actually better than Ritalin (side effects, addiction, etc.). Prescribed cocaine is also a thing."
