freefolk,fd5lxdz,t1_fd5ib1i,1578178885.0,"An empire is a system of government with a centralized ruler. They can be tiny or massive, but size doesn't matter. What makes and empire is the fact that there is one figure that has supreme control over the territory.

Before Augustus, Rome had a senate that held power, thus meaning it was a Republic, not an empire. There's a reason that Roman history is divided into periods such as the ""late Republic""or ""Early Imperial"" that reason being the transition between different systems of governments and statuses."
