I.e: Mar7aba. Asslamu3laykum. 5las?"
saudiarabia,fgubq9l,t3_f0hkg9,1581116964.0,"I kinda feel bad for you and blame your parents. Some societies are very unready for bi-racial kids. Saudi is exactly that. The children are usually the victims of their parents poor planning. If you have a bi racial child, you should put 100% effort into familirizing the child with both cultures/languages. Assimilation is very important. People being left out/isolated is a horrible experience. That said, I wonder what's your dad's background. Saudi families, especially the traditional ones, are usually not okay with their men marrying an outsider. Yet your grandma took you in which is cool.


A while ago I read a post over at the UAE subreddit form a guy with a Filipina mother and and an Arab father. He was so sad and misrable I actually felt really bad for him. The Arab side mocks him and the Filipino side rejects him. He cannot into either side. He's basically fucked. You're obviously doing much better than him. Even still, it is a shitty situation that you did not choose to be brought into.


Anyways. I enjoyed reading your post. Salamat po and Shukran..."

saudiarabia,fgt370l,t1_fgsyq64,1581098095.0,"Well Saudis will almost always have huge weddings ceremonies BUT not for religious reasons. It is entirely a social/traditional thing. Basically a show of wealth and solidarity. Recently though, some Saudis have been shying away from wedding ceremonies because of how much money they cost."
saudiarabia,fgsxpyq,t3_f0cta3,1581094824.0,"What you need for a marriage to be accepted in Islam is the following:

1-Consenting Man and Woman.

 2-Two sane witnesses. 

3-A contract of agreement from both parties.


Anyone who says a wedding is mandatory or that there are addtional conditions is speaking out of his ass."
