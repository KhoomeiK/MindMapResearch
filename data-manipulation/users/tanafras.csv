ABoringDystopia,ff7bi9r,t3_erus6d,1579645568.0,"According to The New York Times, the richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.

Accoring to the Brookings Institute American households held over $98 trillion of wealth in 2018. Wealth, or net worth, is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. Assets are resources with economic value—think houses, retirement funds, and savings accounts.

Let's just round up to $100 trillion from 2018 to 2020 and make it easy to do the math.  

The top 1% in the US alone hold $90 trillion of the wealth in the United states. 

The bottom 99% own $trillion of wealth. 

Google 2019 results: 329.45 people in the US.

This means 3.2945 million people equals on average 2,731,825,770.22 PER PERSON in this class.

This is skewed though.  

According to Saez and Zucman's calculations, in 2012 the top 0.01 percent had an average wealth of $371 million, which would imply a collective total of $6 trillion. That same year, the estimated combined net worth of the individuals on the Forbes 400 list was $1.7 trillion.
And..

160,000 families with net wealth above $20.6 million in 2012.

The average US family size is 2.6 people.

So, 416,000 people control *AT LEAST* $3.29 Trillion in the US, and this is restricted only to capitalizing income tax returns by these families.

Therefore, appliying 1950's tax rate of 91% on that capitalizing income would mean that $2.76 trillion in taxes would flow into the government.  

Enough to instantly pay off all college loans, and providing enough money to convert all state run colleges into world class free universities for everyone to pursue as much education as they would desire to do - from certificates, to multiple PhD.'s, MD's, JD's, etc. Not to mention being able to pay off a lot of motrgages and free everyone from crushing debt interest to banks in the subsequent years, and to provide a universal basic income, and free healthcare for all. Of course, not everything can be done all at once, so these social policies would need to be measured and applied intelligently.
Given that the existing Federal government budget deficit was $984 billion, it would make sense to make the deficit $0 first, second, healthcare for all, if not 100%, say 70% coverage, third, a universal basic income (can cover the other 30%, buy goods, food, rent housing, etc., fourth paying off home loans and student debt equally so neither group feels like the other is gaining an unfair advantage.  Anything left over goes to pay down the national debt.
Within 8 years, most personal property debt is gone, existing student loans are gone, and everyone is going to school for free, the 99% is paying less taxes via the UBI payback, and people are living healthier and happier lives since the 1970, meaning less pressure on the healthcare system.  It also lowers incidences of crime making populations safer.
It lets you choose in investing in green energy, road and rail construction, atmospheric carbon filtering, ocean waste filtering, etc., as well as retraining workforces (CNG,Nuclear) to compete on the global scale in this new reality, and in safer, less hazardous conditions so they enjoy a longer and better life while undoing damage to the planet.
It also allows robotics and AI to become ubiquitous without threatening people wiyh loss of income.  
And, this leaves all existing expenditures exactly the same.  No rise in increased terrorism, geopolitical tensions, etc. No decrease in programs such as medicare, social security, etc.  
These changes also historically increase spending and commerce - GDP goes up,  and widens the middle class standard of living, bringing people out of poverty.
Overall, there's only one candidate whom I see who could bring that all under one roof and make it work for the vast majority of interested parties.  I think we all know who that is.

It's long past due that the average person in the US votes for their personal wealth increase, regardless of their party affiliation or ideologies.
