This is an organization that has funded BOMBINGS. They should be eradicated as an institution and their leaders prosecuted for their criminal activity."

NoahGetTheBoat,ffji4fb,t1_ffjdq0b,1579998715.0,"Everyone has shitty, uninformed opinions about stuff. Even if we're unaware of them, because if we knew more we wouldn't think that way. The issue is that they have platform for being famous entertainers, so when they go on Twitter and spout something utterly idiotic they get heard. Your aunt who reads naturalnews doesn't.

I agree that they shouldn't do paid sponsorships without due diligence, but we should collectively stop giving a shit about their political and personal opinions. They're allowed to have them like everyone else, but they're not why I know who you are."
NoahGetTheBoat,ffjd5ns,t1_ffjcuot,1579995785.0,The message of protecting animals isn't inherently bad. The celebrities could be uneducated about their activities. I always assume famous entertainers are clueless about orgs unless they're personally involved in the operation.
unpopularopinion,ffjcty7,t1_ffjciq1,1579995596.0,"It's pure propaganda. I mean, even the concept is crazy. It's an insanely anti-Western, pro-China forum that posts on a mostly American audience social media platform in English."
NoahGetTheBoat,ffjb5go,t1_ffjaa2y,1579994608.0,"PETA is a fucking dumpster fire. They sponsored terrorism. They kill more animals than any other sheltering agency. And their actual belief structure would eliminate the concept of pets.

PETA needs to be ended and replaced with an actual animal welfare charity."
unpopularopinion,ffjaiki,t1_ffir3ez,1579994245.0,"They would find a way to blame western countries for everything the Chinese fucked up about the situation. r/sino is a fucking joke of a propaganda subreddit, because it's so over the top and obviously exists only to obfuscate the enormous amount of CCP human rights abuses, mostly against their own people."

pics,ffbyq56,t1_ffbwtdk,1579786987.0,"I mean... All the myths and even many ""historic records"" of the time describe people with practically magic and superhuman abilities. Either you make the game a very boring and limited game set in real Grecian history, or you go myths and monsters to some degree and access the cool shit. It was probably made more for a stylistic and gameplay reasons, but it's justifiable because the historians of the time had a world view that accepted those things as real. They heard a story of some dude that was nigh immortal... Well, the king of their gods turned into animals and impregnated women, so yeah, sure."

unpopularopinion,ff7rnbn,t1_ff7reot,1579656696.0,"They're not functionally equivalent. Christians were required to tithe to their religion and pay punitively high Islamic taxes.

What rose colored bullshit history book did you read that thinks the Islamic invaders weren't total shit is a mystery, but you're factually mistaken."

unpopularopinion,ff7qjof,t1_ff7p7fx,1579655927.0,"The later crusades were for political power. First crusades were called due to the brutality of invading armies. And regardless, the Islamic armies invaded Jerusalem and the rest of Israeli lands, which means none of the Crusades were ""invasions"" but defensive calls to arms.

At what point after invading a country, murdering a bunch of civilians and colonizing it does the land become the invaders? Christians had existed there since Roman times. Islam was over a millennia behind and took it by the sword."
unpopularopinion,ff7otlz,t1_ff7mxyy,1579654717.0,"First Crusades was a defensive war against invading Islamic armies and they definitely thought the Christians would be back, so they brutalized prisoners to scare them off. Knights Templar were formed to protect innocent pilgrims going to Jerusalem. This is literally more of the same ""it's ok to demonize the Christians for existing but leave the poor Muslim murderers alone.""

Islamic countries today practice slavery. Christian countries were responsible for stopping the global African slave trade."

If two of your friends get eaten by lions that were hiding in their back seats, it's not phobic to check your back seats before getting in the car."
