It's a shame, I think if he'd bowed out of racing a few years ago then he could have had success with his own team, or coaching, or at least gotten some product endorsements.  Unfortunately he doubled down on it and has lost everything.
  
I think this comes down to not having the right people around him in the later stages of his career.  When you're a young up-and-comer everyone wants to help you, and many riders don't learn to be adults because they have people around them to do that for them.  When the time comes that those adults leave you, you're left a stunted human, used to the high life, but cast adrift in a world you're not prepared for.  Look to Zarco and Iannone for other examples.  Or, just look at pretty much any American Football player, nearly 80% of them will be bankrupt within five years of retirement because they never learned to be adults."

worldnews,ffbiw7r,t1_ffbhmvn,1579767394.0,I was taking aim at the people who won't donate money only time - because they don't trust charities.  If they were spending any meaningful amount of time doing charity work then they'd see the utility of money to a charity.  These sort of people are probably of limited utility to a charity.
worldnews,ffbhh6r,t1_ffbg68t,1579765500.0,"Sorry if I came across as shitting on volunteer work, I didn't mean it, I just meant that people shouldn't say that they will only donate time because they don't trust a charity with money.

Charities need volunteers AND funding.  Saying that you don't trust charities with money - only your time is suggesting that you think that all charities need is [unskilled] bodies.
  
Charities need people to help with low skilled work, but, there's a limit to how much they can do with unskilled labour.  They also need money to pay for relief packages, resources, tools, and probably people with more complex skills.
  
Think of the current bushfire emergency: If you can volunteer for the RFS then great.  If you have the skills in construction or transport to physically go in and work on the rebuilding process, then great.  But to rebuild a building you don't want a whole string of people to donate half a day each, you want a professional who will come in and work the project through - and that level of commitment is likely to require payment.
  
Someone like me, who doesn't have that skill, and doesn't live close to any of the fire affected areas can't reasonably donate their time.  The only thing I could really donate my time to would be fund raising - which would be pretty hypocritical if I had stated that I didn't trust the charity with my own funds.
  
This [opinion piece on voluntourism](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/13/the-business-of-voluntourism-do-western-do-gooders-actually-do-harm) explains some of the concerns.
  
Basically, unless you're filling a specific need then you might be better off earning a few more dollars at home and sending that instead.  If you can't give money, then do unskilled labour for the charity, but money is likely more useful to them."

And how much use is a flaky worker who donates 3 hours every few months to a charity:?

I don't shout my secrets over it, I use it for general purpose chat with people.
