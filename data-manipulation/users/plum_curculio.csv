fatlogic,ffeh6gt,t3_et4oms,1579847849.0,This is some level of cuckoo right here. The math is off for starters and this person is comparing two photos that don't correspond to the two weights she mentions—what did she weigh 3.5 years ago?  Should have had a photo from a month ago and a photo from today if that was the comparison she wanted to make.
fatlogic,ff8b9c0,t3_er9ovn,1579671647.0,"No. Emotional eating is not self-care. 

Just as emotional consumption of alcohol/cocaine/heroin/etc is not a form of self-care.

I think food can be a part of a self-care practice, but it's good healthy food that has nutritional value—not a pint of Häagen-Dazs."
fatlogic,ff8ahyg,t3_erotwi,1579670918.0,"My mom used to point out fat people at restaurants—it was so embarrassing going out to restaurants with her. She has mellowed out since I told her to stop commenting on strangers bodies and what they've ordered because it's creepy and embarrassing. 

So I get what this person is saying, they've probably been to a restaurant where my mom (or someone like her) has been overly vocal about the presence of someone of size being on the premises."
fatlogic,ff89l5e,t3_es20yb,1579670053.0,"This makes my heart hurt a little.

There is such a cult-mentality in the HAES/FA movements. I mean, feeling like you're betraying the movement because you want to lose a bit of weight so your foot doesn't hurt as much...damn."

fatlogic,ff36qwg,t3_erdmq7,1579535016.0,I don't understand how infinifat is a badge of honour rather than either a serious wakeup call or an insult.
fatlogic,ff36gke,t3_er5s1i,1579534821.0,Definitely don't want to be near the bathroom when this individual goes poop.
fatlogic,feyon1j,t3_eqmcd7,1579448388.0,"So drinking a bottle of wine to yourself is self-care too?

And hitting the crack pipe is also self-care?"
fatlogic,fewe10r,t3_eqob2b,1579409019.0,"Oh come on. This reads like it was written by my former roommate—who used to try to make me feel guilty for going to the climbing gym all the time. I get free passes with my monthly membership and tried to give her one once and she screamed at me for having the nerve to offer her one. I only tried to give her one because I thought maybe she'd have fun trying something new for free. 

I am so done with people who act as if my existence is offensive to them. They are the ones who are actively chasing misery."
fatlogic,fem51ml,t3_eplsn1,1579240008.0,"Ah yes, cite the Biggest Loser study...because it's so accurate and reflects the experiences of thousands of overweight and obese people who too, for a varying chunk of time are cooped up in a house filled with exercise equipment and screaming personal trainers—then without warning, released into the wild where they go back to their families, jobs and old habits. 

/s

The average Joe Schmo does not live like a contestant on the Biggest Loser Ranch. 

That aside, I want to give a shout out to #1 in that conversation. Way to tell it like it is."
fatlogic,fem3fks,t1_felbo3c,1579238465.0,I'm with you. I've never liked it. It is way too sweet and tastes gross.
fatlogic,fem2s2f,t1_fem097b,1579237858.0,">Social media is why I stopped trying to be an ally. It’s irritating and stressful trying to walk on eggshells with people like this. 

Feel the same. I'm done with engaging with people who are constantly angry—they're looking for fights and will pull one out of thin air if they want to."
fatlogic,fem1ics,t3_eppewe,1579236716.0,"Sugar and a diet of junk absolutely play a role in the development of T2 diabetes. I've known this since I was a child.

fatlogic,fehbr5x,t3_ep61tp,1579113292.0,"Witnessing the decline of western civilization right here folks.

This is so superficial and so dumb. It must be tiring to be a whiny fat person who thinks nobody likes you because you are fat—partially true, people probably don't like you, but it's because of your foul personality not your body."
fatlogic,feh1lv6,t3_ep2gek,1579107247.0,"He probably lacks ""compassion and humility"" because he has to talk to people like this person all day long and his patience has worn thin after interacting with people who consistently ignore his advice—knowledge he got after only going to post-secondary school for 8 years.

fatlogic,feh0rqp,t3_eorlnp,1579106738.0,"There are so many reasons why I do not want to be fat, most of which are because of health and mobility reasons. Looks don't matter as much as health and mobility—looks change and I'm cool with that.  I'm gonna be old and wrinkly one day—but probably a cute AF old and wrinkly person who will still be crushing 5.12s at the climbing gym."
fatlogic,fegztsl,t3_ep2d6m,1579106168.0,"Great, promote more mindless consumerism AND continue to put your body at risk. 

Also aren't HAES/FAs always complaining about the lack of choices they have for clothes?"
fatlogic,fegzku8,t3_eotyif,1579106016.0,"I am confused by what they are saying here. 

Are they trying to kill the fitness industry because they think the fitness industry is vilifying their existence?

Or are they trying to take over jobs in the fitness industry by getting fit?

Also plenty of HAES/FAs also use their bodies as a business card.

I also hate that hashtag and people who think they are cute for being sassy—nah, just rude."
fatlogic,fegy454,t3_ep26oc,1579105111.0,"Then why do so many people who align themselves with HAES or the fat activists movement often refer to themselves as fat as if it's the cornerstone of their existence.

For example: 

>""Fat bi poly cis-femme donut lover"" 

I am confused."
fatlogic,fegxkrn,t3_ep2e84,1579104777.0,No. This is messed up.
fatlogic,fegxfk9,t3_ep2rum,1579104687.0,"I don't think I've ever seen a post here that makes fun of fat person exercising—which is a lousy thing to do. 

This sub if anything, encourages people to see through the complete BS that is HAES and get their lives on a healthier path. We don't hate anyone here, but we hate the terrible advice that we see being promoted on social media. 

But if you don't like that, sure, continue to ignore your doctor's advice and come back to chat with us in ten years and tell us how much your joints hurt or how you have T22 diabetes or heart disease. Just because you're fine now, doesn't mean you're fine in later years—and this is true for people of any size, but for those with obesity, they're at a greater risk of developing health problems."

fatlogic,fdply4m,t3_emcqsi,1578632349.0,"I don't think anyone is saying ""All thin people are healthy.""

If you spend all of your time doing drugs and partying—nobody is gonna think you're healthy."
fatlogic,fdcjews,t3_ekkzhj,1578276381.0,"From an anti-diet book by a celebrity, not a doctor or a scientist, a celebrity who herself is not fat. 

You will most definitely regain weight if you lose it with the mentality that you only need to follow a certain diet and exercise program for X amount of time. It's not some big magical mystery folks. The weight stays off when you stick with a solid plan."

fatlogic,fdchl5j,t3_ekgr6e,1578275084.0,"I exercise because it's fun, I've met great people through climbing and gets me out of my anxious little head.

Yeah, it's cool to see my muscles grow and all, but what's even cooler is seeing my self-worth grow because I'm now able to do things I couldn't last year.  

Contrary to what they believe, it is not all about looks."

fatlogic,fd9zx6i,t3_eke8m4,1578240058.0,People 30 years ago did not regularly eat hamburgers the size of a 10 year old's head.

fatlogic,fd9vv1r,t3_ekcr9j,1578238705.0,"This person's friend should go see another doctor—who will likely tell her the same thing as the previous doctor.

Even a small-ish weight loss along with a healthier lifestyle could result in a lowered blood pressure reading. But she'll never go for it because she can't get too healthy.

What is wrong with these people? I would much rather be prescribed a diet to follow than to use pills to survive something that could be reversed with a healthy diet."

Anaphylactic reactions don't exactly seem like signs from your body that say ""go for it pal, you should have that peanut butter brittle even though it makes your throat close up.""

Who in their right mind would willingly eat something they know they would be hospitalized for eating?"

I hate how there is this idea floating around that you're not allowed to lose weight because it will offend other fatties. Why the fuck do you care what other people think about you? Offending people with your weight loss should be the least of your concerns—in fact, celebrate it—you don't need those sour faced people in your life anyways.

Also is  your fat getting in the way of progressing in activities you love? Lose the weight and climb that 5.12b like the fucking Alex Honnold that you are."
