getdisciplined,fd8gw8m,t3_ek9g86,1578218229.0,"I too was in your situation. I use the app called ""AppBlock"" to limit my screen time. You can try it. Other apps are ""StayFocused"" and ""Study Helper""

Because of these three apps I now use my smartphone less than 4 hours. Although my end goal is to bring it down to a hour and a half. These apps helped me, they certainly can help you."
DecidingToBeBetter,fd8ab95,t3_ek9d9h,1578215846.0,"This decision might just change your life. There are scientific evidences that exercising just not change our body but our mind too. Exercising will definitely work on your depression too.

Try this : Even on days you don't want to exercise still go to the gym. You will automatically would want to do at least one or two exercise. You will instantly feel better.

Congratulations on taking a life changing decision. I too am trying to changing my life and that is why I created a blog to get advice from those reading it."
NewYearsResolution,fd33qxx,t1_fcrcji8,1578154447.0,Yes. It is called [productivitysupplement.com](https://productivitysupplement.com) I am still working on it but I update it every week. I will update it tomorrow as well. My goal is to provide some insight on what goals I am achieving and how I am working on it. Will also try to write a few blogs.
productivity,fd32jv3,t3_ejwhgx,1578154175.0,I do agree that starting a new goal on new year is quite motivational but those who really want to change they start now. I am on what you can call new year high being quite productive with my studies and stuff. I have some goals but I have divided them based on my priorities so I do give myself that space to slack off on few tasks.
productivity,fd234pg,t3_ejp6a3,1578140958.0,"You can either go for ""AppBlock-Stay focused"" or ""StayFocused"". These two are the apps which I use. I mostly use AppBlock and I have given it permission to block Instagram from 9PM to 7PM next day because of which I hardly use Instagram nowadays and my average consumption is down to 20 minutes down from 2 hours prior to using this app."
nosurf,fcwzeo2,t3_ej2o9g,1578044287.0,"Of course you will. I personally don't use any social media apps that much. I deducted my FB use by simply using it on their laggy and non optimized browser website. This somehow encouraged my to use less and less FB. Now I hardly use FB once a week and that for like 5-10 minutes. I don't feel addicted to it all. 

Instagram also now with their time limit feature has motivated me to use it less than 10 minutes a day to my previous 1.5 hour of usage. Little things matter. I hope you never regret this decision ever. Have a best no surf life."
getdisciplined,fcwo1z2,t3_ej0b36,1578031226.0,That's a nice goal. Why don't you install a habit tracker app so you could track each individual goal ?
productivity,fcuk9cy,t3_eiyfnx,1577982897.0,"Lack of sleep, yes but getting a nice sleep isn't permanent solution to your lack of focus. I have read about this a lot and to be honest you're quite better since on an average our attention span is now 7 seconds (Less than a goldfish). I suggest you start meditating. If you can do the most boring thing in the world i.e focusing on your breathing for at least 15 minutes without a day without getting some other thoughts  in your mind I am pretty much sure you can focus on other things as well."
getdisciplined,fcqbhbq,t3_ei79rj,1577882722.0,Try one single thing at a time. One goal at a time. I have tried changing everything at once; it didn't work. I have given up on that. Now I am only focusing on self improvement goal at a time. You should try it too.
