I enjoyed the way that society corrupted his mind until he purged, rather than a chemical or something similar. In reflection its almost accurate at how we would act if there was a random man laughing constantly on a bus, it would make us feel uncomfortable, maybe even unsafe. Goes to show how everyday actions can make a difference in someone's life. Makes me feel quite saddened by the way I may have acted in the past. I hope that, that is what the whole team who created this movie wanted.
