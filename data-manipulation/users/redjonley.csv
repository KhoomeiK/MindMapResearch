eagles,fenunff,t1_fenmp8s,1579291062.0,I'd figure this is more to do with their seeming inability to get a quick rush and finish the play over the last few years. Way too much talent to not be one of the top teams in sacks over the last few years.
eagles,fenuf6w,t1_fenk554,1579290925.0,I think I recall reading that. I can't imagine that came from Pederson considering Wentz hasn't been given that to try out.
eagles,fenu8ip,t3_eq3p72,1579290814.0,I'm sure r/mikekafka is disappointed.
eagles,fenu2um,t1_fenmffb,1579290720.0,Yeah I mean going QB in the 4th makes a lot of sense so long as we don't get Marcus Smith'd again in the first few rounds. Having a young QB to develop cheaply is only going to help given Wentz's health and this teams love for trading.  For the record I'm not suggesting we trade Wentz for some 4th round qb. Having him come in to backup in case Wentz takes another cheap shot or whatever and eventually trade if a good situation comes up would be ideal.

As a white person I was in your shoes in high school hearing about diversity programs in colleges. It isn't what people make it out to be.

eagles,felq81f,t1_feli1nu,1579228281.0,"I see an institutional bias towards hiring white coaches. Along with every other profession in the US. Regardless of the makeup of the employees, management, and ownership tend to be white. That's what this is aimed at fighting. No one is saying there is a racist cabal of owners and influencers forcing black coaches to assistant positions.  The US has had a very overtly racist past (the not so distant past mind you) and as a result, the institutions we have are still coasting off that societal inertia.  Things like the Rooney rule are small attempts to curb these biases."
TumblrInAction,fel9b9i,t1_feks6le,1579216876.0,This would be the correct answer. I think I might be done with this sub. Thanks for posting a more articulate argument than I would have.
eagles,fekf6fc,t1_fek8f2i,1579198767.0,Got to say I fully agree with you. We have a capiable backup in Dillard that will come into his own with time learning how to run block at an NFL level. Who cares if he can play 16 games? He will be a top 10 tackle in the 10 games he does play in. Sounds worth it to me given the depth situation at that position.

These four should get ya started.  Better quality of life (happier), a higher chance of achieving the ""American Dream"" than in the United States, and healthcare and education guaranteed.  Seems like a pretty sweet deal for those in poverty now.

So far as I can tell from the second source, worldpopulationreview.com is just some guy from Connecticut named Shane. 

Again, on top of having actual figures from reputable sources I've been there (France, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium) and can speak from a first hand perspective to let you know, my guy, you are in fact wrong. These people work less and have far more guaranteed to them by the government than we do here. This hasn't made them some poor destitute nation of serfs.  There are still rich people, you can be rich if you're lucky or born into it, same as the US, in fact, statistically speaking you have a much better chance to be born poor and die rich in almost any western country than in the United States. 

You can have your capitalism and eat it too. I've seen enough mansions and flamboyant European sports cars to know you can do well for yourself, and have a government that ensures the average worker does somewhat well too."
PS4,feh5ni6,t1_feh4pr6,1579109651.0,"Assuming that the poor in the US have more than poor in other comparable countries is some pretty large conjecture. Being someone who's been to the comperable countries that are doing better than the United States, I can assure you that isn't true.  And yes, you can't *just* tax the rich and expect a different/better result. The same as you can't just lower taxes and expect a different/better result.
