OutOfTheLoop,ffbc1tw,t3_esnmfj,1579759133.0,"Answer: You are absolutely correct in this thinking, but this is complicated her by a few factors:

1) Sonos speakers are stupidly expensive. Looking at a quick Google search, the cheapest you can find is $150 USD with more expensive ones going for ten times that.

2) The update system will refuse to update newer models should one of the discontinued models be connected to a new one

3) The company has a trade-in system where one could trade in an old model for up to 30% off a new model, like trading in an iPhone or old car. However, unlike the two examples, the old models are set to “recycle mode”, which effectively bricks the unit and will not allow others to use it, even if you try to reset it to factory standards"
