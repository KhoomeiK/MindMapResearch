AmItheAsshole,ffd6l69,t1_ffcxbjv,1579814417.0,"Post partum depression is indeed a real thing and a nasty mental illness that women _can_ get after giving birth. That is a _whole_ other thing than calling them crazy because hormones. Calling women crazy just because they gave birth is demeaning and misogynistic. Note that I say and said “misogynistic”, describing a specific part of your comment, not calling you a misogynist. 
To which you, very eloquently, reacted by calling me crazy. I rest my case.

Edit: I see that I did make a stab at you in my original comment. Will delete that part, my apologies"

Wow, this does not sound demeaning or misogynistic _at all_"

AmItheAsshole,ffbdlno,t3_eso58s,1579760829.0,"I don’t get all these nta posts. He just lost his father very, very recently at a way too young age. He is grieving. Everyone grieves differently. He probably has anger about how unfair it is for someone, his loved one, to die too soon. That anger is going to come out. And that’s okay. This doesn’t mean he’s going to chew OP out every time she does something about her appearance. It means he’s hurting now and yes, overreacting. But we can’t blame him for that, not right now, days after he lost his dad. 
OP, you handled this very well. NAH"
