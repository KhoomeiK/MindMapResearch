Saying there hasn't been any innovation in the sciences because they're not as revolutionary as what has happened in IT is a little ridiculous. The sciences have been innovated and revolutionized countless times over thousands of years and that continues today (CRISPR, Exoplanets, Particle Physics...etc). IT is in it's infancy compared to sciences, obviously there will be more rapid development in those areas. If you think IT will be developing at this rate in 500 years you'll likely be wrong, just look at the obsolescence of Moore's law.

It's also not that crazy that you're not seeing as rapid development in other fields because everything is trending to digitization. Someone mentioned the phone, but it has been revolutionized! We don't even have them at my office anymore, everything is over Skype. That would be the case with a lot of ""physical"" things.
