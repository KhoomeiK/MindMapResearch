fatlogic,ffjce92,t1_ffija2u,1579995344.0,"That’s a valid point.  As well as food deserts do truly exist.  I do recognize that when I say that healthy food and exercise aren’t *that* expensive or hard to find time for, it comes from a place of relative privilege, with a 40-hour-a-week job with a reasonably comfortable salary.  So yes, I can purchase fresh produce and have the time to prepare it.

That said, the aggressive marketing from
Big Food companies is complicit.  It’s overall a complicated issue."
fatlogic,ffjbr66,t1_ffj7zfs,1579994967.0,"And in some cases - pure laziness.  I mean, the thought of not having to work, or not having to do anything you don’t want to is nice.   But most of us don’t have that luxury.  In fact, most people who are like that (and I don’t mean truly disabled) have the privilege of someone else to take care of them."
fatlogic,ffj77rr,t3_eto5sr,1579992124.0,"It’s not a lifestyle change if you slip back into old habits.  Much like a recovering alcoholic who must be vigilant about not relapsing, the same can be said for someone who might fall off the wagon when it comes to changing their nutrition and exercise.

We are human and flawed.  It’s easy to fall back into old habits, especially in times of stress.  It’s easy to get complacent and think ONE donut won’t hurt (until it becomes a daily thing again), or that skipping one night of exercise won’t be a problem (until it’s become a month).  It’s not that the healthier choices don’t work, it’s that people aren’t perfect and sometimes we regress without realizing it.

It took me 10+ years and numerous attempts to quit smoking.  Even going almost 6 months without a cigarette then saying “just one”.  So I get it.  But that doesn’t mean it was pointless to try.  Now it’s been 8 years smoke free.  Lifestyle changes do work, as long as we stick with it."
fatlogic,ffj6czn,t3_etu4s3,1579991528.0,"Hoping that this comes out how it sounds in my head.  Ok.  So I’ve noticed within the current iteration of the feminist movement, combating ableism and fatphobia are big topics.  As they should be in the context of not discriminating against people with disabilities, or because their bodies aren’t visually pleasing to the masses.  It’s good to address these items.  Especially when it comes to increasing access for people with disabilities.  However, within the same movement, but on the more extreme side, is this weird obsession with chronic illness/disability, which even borders on Munchausen’s.  Suddenly there seems to be a huge increase of young, mostly female people claiming to be “disabled”.  Along with that they insist that the expectation to be a productive member of society is patriarchal and capitalist.  And this ties right into the FA movement with the same claims of patriarchy and capitalism.

So apparently it’s come full circle and it’s not feminist to be strong and healthy and financially independent?  Feminists in the past fought for equality in the workplace (not that we have it yet but obviously more so than 30-40 years ago).  Now it seems that the feminist ideal - at least according to the far left (and I’m pretty damn far left) is to be sickly and physically weak and unable to be productive?  

Again I hope this came out right, but this current ideology of FA along with feminism seems counterintuitive.  Of course we should fight for people with disabilities, but purposely rendering oneself disabled then complaining about oppression just doesn’t make sense."

fatlogic,ffgnwet,t3_etg8n6,1579910640.0,"The hypocrisy is, broccoli isn’t exactly a big business.  There’s no fresh produce lobby.  In fact, most small farmers aren’t even subsidized - which is why farmers are truly struggling to make ends meet.  Meanwhile, big food corporations like McDonalds are a powerful lobby, they market aggressively, and they are the epitome of capitalism.  If anything is “patriarchy”, it is a huge corporation that profits off keeping people fat and sick.   It’s also weird to me that this bizarre obsession with being sick and disabled is somehow feminism - vs being healthy and strong and entirely self-reliant."
fatlogic,ffgndj1,t3_etgmzb,1579910275.0,"I like being able to go to the online menu before going out so that I can pre-calculate and decide in advance.

Sometimes I just feel like mindlessly snacking.  An entire bag of baby spinach is like 20 calories (and nutrient dense).  The bag of snap peas is a little higher in calories - I think like 75-150 depending on the size of the bag, but also packed with nutrients, plus filling because of the water and fiber content."
fatlogic,fff7379,t3_etaucq,1579877375.0,"Maybe perhaps just maybe - if nutrition and fitness were taught and encouraged in schools, it would be a first step towards reducing obesity levels.  Maybe if schools were actually properly funded and didn’t have to cut phys Ed while at the same time having to rely on junk-filled vending machines for revenue.  Maybe if those phys Ed classes were made to be fun, with teachers vigilant about preventing bullying of the less athletic kids.  And maybe bringing back home ec - for kids of ALL genders, and teaching how to prepare nutritious food for oneself vs relying on fast food or frozen meals."

That actually happened once - ran into an acquaintance who had lost some weight and made a well-meaning compliment.  Turned out she actually DID have cancer.  Oops.  So I don’t disagree with not saying anything unless you know.

But, if someone is trying and was successful, acknowledging and complimenting is giving encouragement, just like with any other achievement.  It’s not fAtPhObIc, it’s not saying they were less worthy before.  It’s acknowledging someone’s hard work."
fatlogic,ff8en24,t3_es6gf2,1579675234.0,"The disdain and derision they have for medical professionals is astounding.  

Ok, I’m a former smoker (quit in 2011).  As a smoker, I was still healthy because I was young and active - but the clock was ticking.  You can be healthy until you’re not.  And every time I saw my PCP (generally just for annual physicals), they talked about quitting smoking.  Of course they were right.  And yes I didn’t want to hear it when I was much younger (early 20’s), but I knew they were right, and knew it had nothing to do with malice or prejudice, and everything to do with the fact that smoking is not healthy.  Sure, you can get away with it when you are young and fit, but it WILL catch up to you.  You may be one of the lucky ones, but it’s a gamble.

I kind of see food addiction on par with smoking:  it’s not quite the same as alcohol or illicit drugs in that overdoing it can’t kill you instantly.   Most average smokers and average overeaters (not the FA’s, just the regular people) are just people who developed a bad habit, possibly out of stress or anxiety or boredom.  

And while I don’t doubt that there is some level of medical bias against fat people, I also think that most doctors are genuinely giving advice on what is best for their patients’ health."

It seems like the person with the middle seat should have a very valid complaint.  They should have their fare refunded - at least partially.
