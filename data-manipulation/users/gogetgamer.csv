I hope I never have to use them but if I do I'm rescuing the fattest lady, they have most buoyancy. They didn't teach us that at lifeguard school."

ShitAmericansSay,fgwvjrg,t1_fgwqrgo,1581166209.0,That seems to be the prevailing ignorance here. People with no knowledge of Russian/Soviet attacks on Finland are downvoting me based on their own ignorance.

ShitAmericansSay,fgwgue8,t1_fgwdymg,1581160931.0,"Maybe you've heard about Russia interfering in other countries business before, so happens that Finland has been the target of Russian and Soviet hostilities for centuries now. Russia is the reason Eastern-Europe cannot have nice things. 

Russia has used propaganda, espionage, bribery, sabotage, outright threats and a full on war to try to gain power over Finland - and they are still attacking Finnish media and free elections. 

It would take me all day to list the transgressions of Russia against the Finnish people, but overall Finland has not only managed to resist, they've managed to stay in the top 10 of the Human Wellbeing Index for some decades now, usually ranking in the top 5.
Where most countries bordering Russia have a hard time fighting Russian influence, Finland has flourished. 

Secondly Finland has one of the best school systems in the whole-wide world. Again, despite Russian attempts to ruin it."

I see you need to break free. Your family and hometown are wearing you down.

Here is some unwanted advice - take it or leave it, it is well meant and worked for me.

I urge you to decide that you are going to have a good life. Make that decision and tell yourself you've made that decision. This is your life. You only have one. Decide to live a good one. Then find ways to go there. You know all this. 

Talk to your inner parent and ask them to guide you to make only the best decisions for yourself. Talk to higher powers and ask them for help. Try motivational tapes and hypnoses. Remove what's holding you back. Or decide that it is not your problem in the case of your family. 

The best way to get economically stable and find a good job is to **move to a place where the economy is on the rise.** This is how opportunities are made, not by hanging around the same town where the same bleak opportunities are. MOVE!

You have to venture into the world in order to find your own opportunities. Go up North where the industry is booming, or wherever. Look at the economy map, you can see the counties/areas where new jobs are getting created and the economy is on the rise. MOVE THERE. At least while you get your working legs. Then you have opportunities to go wherever you want. This will also get you out of your parents house and out of all the patterns that are holding you back.

Wishing you all the best. And vitamin D."

You're projecting your feelings of defense onto me when I didn't say a thing about your position one way or the other. I thanked you for pointing out this marginal problem. Because research shows it is a marginal problem.

relationship_advice,fgrdtf9,t3_f01lne,1581044369.0,"Jesus Christ, you are dating a classic narcissist. Don't expect him to change. He will not only be like this, sucking the will to live out of you, he will get worse as the relationship progresses. And when you have children it will become even worse because he'll be jealous of the baby too.

he is not emotionally mature enough to have a relationship. He doesn't know who he is but he sure can make you responsible for everything in his life regardless.

You are only staying together out of duty and because it is too hard to break up.

Stop having unprotected sex with him to ease your upcoming breakup."

That his lying is pathological and a symptom of his sick inner man. A man that cannot for one moment be truthful about who he is: a lying cheat.
