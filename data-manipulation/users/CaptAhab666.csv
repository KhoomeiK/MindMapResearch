lonely,ffh8tq2,t1_fffdzgx,1579926421.0,"While I'd like to agree with you, I can say that is actually the opposite. Not everyone will have someone. 

I have not only seen 1 friend but at least 4 or 5 friends who are single at their late 40's and early 50's simply because no woman wants them. And this was unsurprisingly backed up by recent scientific studies and research. Ugly/short/fat men are more likely to die alone and end up being single.

I understand your good intentions but mostly the 'unattractive' guys that girls often say they're attracted to are actually fairly decent looking.
And regarding 'hope', us ugly men shouldn't have any in the first place. It will make things easier.

But anyway thanks for your kind words."
lonely,fffgfyx,t1_fffdmi5,1579883415.0,"And what do those guys get? A fake wife who doesn't really love them. Exactly what Im saying. The only way ugly guys get someone is by buying their love with money. But once the money dries out, she's gone.

That's a nightmare relationship. Its like starting a life with an escort. You can't have any emotional connection with that kind of woman."
lonely,fff8aps,t1_fff6akz,1579878210.0,"Its both. Gay men would have a hard time too bcos of the size of dating pool plus how certain parts of the world still treat gay people unfairly and poorly. 

Straight men have a hard time because the women are almost always the selectors and having social media with loads of fake people have driven standards up unrealistically. So the men who lack sick pack abs or are unattractive are totally taken out of the equation of ever finding someone."
lonely,fff4iyn,t1_ffeqvu3,1579875501.0,Not for this case.
lonely,fff4ia0,t1_ffeq90k,1579875487.0,Yeap it does.
lonely,ffegqda,t3_et3rzn,1579847357.0,"You're a girl. Trust me, some dude somewhere WILL find you attractive for who you are.

Can't say the same for guys. Ugly unattractive males are more likely to live and die alone. There is even scientific proof and research of this.

I'm not trying to make this an issue of gender but I hope you take comfort that for you ladies, there is somebody out there for each one of you. So don't lose hope and keep your chin up."
singapore,ff9f7ra,t1_ff98g1b,1579711729.0,"Nope not dagestan levels. Hahaha Im no Khabib or Fedor to tahan their training. Just simple basic catch wrestling. Nothing too in depth. I've trained bjj for a bit. Evolve is no doubt the best gym in sg  except I find it too pricey (but of course reasonable considering the facilities they have).

Impact sounds good though. Im above 18. Just want to do something I've been interested for since I was a young teen which is MMA. I like the wrestlers like Mark Coleman, RDA, GSP etc so I was thinking it would be nice to learn abit of wrestling."

If you're ok with talking to me, may I send you a PM?"
