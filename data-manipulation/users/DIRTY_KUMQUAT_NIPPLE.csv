The guy who has been fighting and advocating for the middle class for decades, on record as being one of the most consistent politicians in this regard, has been playing the long con the entire time and the reason you know this is because he decided to buy a third house? You want to tell me how that logic makes sense in your mind?  I don't give a crap what he does with his own money that he got from writing a book (except if he were to use it to manipulate special interests groups). What I do care about is policies that will make millionaires like him and billionaires pay more in taxes and create structural change in America that will help EVERY middle class worker in America, which is exactly what his platform is about.

He is advocating for structural change that would help every single person in America. Giving healthcare for all. Free public education.

changemyview,ff9f4no,t1_ff8zj9p,1579711675.0,"The problem with this logic, if this is why Hillary hates Bernie, is the two party system in America makes it extremely difficult for someone other than a Democrat or Republican to run for president. If people like Bernie aren't allowed to run in either of the two parties, it would severely limit the ideas that are being discussed in American politics. If Bernie wasn't allowed to run in 2016, I'm not sure if we'd be talking about the ""radical"" ideas that he has proposed. We'd probably just be discussing expanding on Obamacare or at most, adding a public option. 

To put my tinfoil hat on, I think this is exactly what the establishment wants. It wants to persuade people who shake things up too much from running so the status quo can be maintained. It'd seem rather silly to me if she was mad at Bernie just because he hasn't registered as a Democrat."

Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist but his policy ideas make me think of him more as someone who advocates for social democracy.
MemeEconomy,ff52zlj,t1_ff51fb8,1579578821.0,"Social democracy is different than socialism for way more reasons than not being a dictatorship. Socialism is the idea that the means of production/distribution etc. are owned by the collective and private property isn't allowed (Edit: The only exception is that individuals can own property but industrial production is completely government owned). 

Social democracy is where major aspects of the economy are socialized like healthcare and schooling but the capitalist aspects of the economy are still maintained (but usually more regulated). Very few people are actually advocating for full-on socialism in the United States"

You are right. if we do things the old fashioned way, there is no way M4A gets passed, even with a progressive president. The thing I like about Bernie is that not only does he a bold progressive agenda, but he has a huge grassroots movement behind, far bigger than any we have seen in America before. It'll take a huge movement like that, and people not only getting in the streets, but also putting immense pressure on their politicians if we ever want to get M4A passed. I think Bernie is the candidate that can rally Americans and make real change in America"
