She’s allowed to complain because she’s a child, and them getting offended is childish on their part. 
I dealt the same when I went to Japan and came back. I complained about so much, and hated so much of American culture and food. Still do, but I learned to deal with what I can afford. 
My mother hated when I came up with ideas and changes that would help. 
Like we could take our shoes off when we come in to not track dirt. She would end up making sure my shoes ended up back in my room. 
Both my parents got offended that I thought they lived better, and now I see how childish they were to be offended by a child who they sent to another country. 
It’s like sending a kid to a Christian school hoping they don’t turn out a christian (real life scenario btw watched it happen and super sad).
NTA just parents giving into their fragile ego instead of using event like this to teach and parent. Poor kid is going to just be resentful to her parents. Sorry you had to go through that.
That’s rough that they all turned on you. They’re the real assholes here."
exchristian,ff6dpcg,t3_erpuyx,1579624954.0,"I remember after an awful email from a friends mom defending her daughter’s delusional belief of her husbands leg growing back I told her I’m done with religion. 
Then I peek on her Facebook to see that she shared a post saying “religion isn’t God”

Like wtf...  I don’t speak to her anymore."
CPTSD,ff56vuv,t3_erkcyr,1579581948.0,"My father is kind of an enabler to my mother, and my mother is exactly this. She loves to bring up her fucked up past by either using it as shock value, or as a funny story, or to guilt us in how we get to live. 
My brother is now repeating the cycle by also being an enabler. My father said to me one day, “ I don’t understand how your mother seems to be okay with the kids being raised like she was” I gave a chuckle and was like “I do”

I should’ve said “ your wife is fucking sick and so are you, so get some therapy and get your shit together so maybe your sick son can see he can do the same”

My brother did mention therapy to me a while back and my eyes lit up so fast, and started telling about it, but again, I can’t change people and I’m done hoping anything for anyone. My door is always open for discussion, and closed for BS."
Psychosis,ff23mys,t1_ff1iw7u,1579492903.0,"Simple and to the point. I agree. It all sucks, and we don’t choose this, but we can manage it, and If you do your best then your son will understand, and hopefully you get you more stable.
Bad genes sucks, stress sucks, but meds and a support system to keep you in check are gold. Find trusted people that you’re okay with having some control in your life it happens again, and don’t stress just do what needs to get done for yourself health."
CPTSD,feypfd1,t3_equc8n,1579448683.0,"My boyfriend is Brazilian and though we agree that hitting anyone is just a no. I’ve been blessed that he’s such a quiet passive soul and never never yelled at me even when I did to him. His relatives I’ve friended on Facebook made me die a little. They all would say that we need to beat our children because they went through it and look how they turned out, and that’s the issue with this generation. I ended up defriending them and having a discussion with my boyfriend. I’m glad we agree that it’s never right unless it’s a dangerous situation and you hurt them to save them ex. In front of a moving car. That’s really the only exception. 
I hate hate hate when people talk about parenting like they know shit. Lead by example, but that requires work right? 

Yes we are out there, and I will fight with my last breathe to educate people that in no way should a kid be beaten or slapped or spanked. It needs to end.its abuse of power and leads us to live fearfully."
depression,fekci12,t3_epe2m7,1579197177.0,"Hey, it sucks and I feel you! I may have bipolar which has caused ups and downs which may explain why I tend to jump off my meds when I feel better. Only to crash. 
Here’s an awesome lecture if you have the chance to listen to about the causes of depression. 
So next time someone tries to offer advice you can hit them with biological facts.

I love how awesome this guy is “like hey they’re not just being lazy for the fun of it” it’s biological!! Dammit. 

I’m so happy for seroquel and mood stabilizers. Finally gettting the right treatment after 4 years of saying heyy something isn’t right."
AdultChildren,fek1p6x,t3_epgsk1,1579190721.0,"So I’ve been in therapy for I want to say 5 years now. Went from CBT counselor to EMDR and a LSWA therapist. I finished one memory of my earliest feeling of shame. It was amazing , and I’m nervous for more because that one wasn’t that hard. It produces vivid dreams, along with the meds I take also does so.
In one dream my mother came up to me complaining how my father treats her and I just bursted saying that she and my little brother could get on disability and leave. That I would not hear it anymore if she continues to keep herself in this situation.
I heard about covert incest today on a podcast and it stung. I knew about it before hand but it sting stung as they listed traits that were my own. It’s not incest but emotional manipulation by a parent. Family’s with enmeshment react together. If she’s sad I’m sad. Some people think they’re empaths, but it most likely shows that we suffered enmeshment. When my dad was anxiously running around the house for something we all were too. 
I feel you, and I’m glad I stumbled on this. I used to wish for my mother to die. Not because I wished that on her, but it would give me peace(I would think, I’ve learned a lot since then of all the work that needed to get done in myself to stop the pattern.) plus it seems as though she is constantly miserable even when she smiles. 
I used to hate her, but I’m in a better place now. It all sucks tbh, and once I move out I know I’ll have to go limited contact for my own peace. 

It sucks to watch the ones we love suffer, and worse to know they don’t wish to get better.

Hope we both get the peace we deserve in due time. 
Your feelings are so so valid, and I hope you know that. The amount of pressure and stress we endure is tremendous even if we can’t see it. 
Hugs."
depression_help,feeygmt,t3_eorrrl,1579043982.0,"Are you on any meds? also I heard a great TEd Talk of someone who suffered from chronic pain about exercise that inspired me. Just do 1 minute of exercise because 1 minute is better than none, and sometimes that one minute may turn to 5 or ten. Isn't ten minutes better than none? even if it seems lik its not much you will slowly train your mind and body that you can do it. I somehow fall of the bandwagon after a while and cant get back to it.

I understand you as you take the words right out of my mouth with that last sentence. I promise it gets better, its not your fault. If you want to see how not your fault it is I'm watching this lecture that shows how biological depression is.

baby steps, very baby steps, and maybe some meds or better meds to help so you can exercise. You deserve peace."

Empaths,fee9sw3,t3_eomdst,1579029348.0,"Beautiful, I’m going to meditate on this later. It amazing how much we treat water as healing. Even in the Christian religion of being baptized in water, is a symbol of rebirth. Also the fact that all life came from water, and we are born with water in the womb."

BipolarReddit,fedrah4,t3_eolj4u,1579018196.0,"My poor mother went from doctor to doctor with no results and she kept advocating until someone finally said “ You have a brain tumor” she was in bed spinning and nauseous constantly. So yes, we aren’t crazy, it’s just easier to think we are. Makes me so mad, but I hope you bask in that pride of standing up for yourself, it’s fucking hard work."
