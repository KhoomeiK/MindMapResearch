Comedowns are just the body returing its nurochemicals to normal, this is contarary to withdrawl where your nurons are not the correct quantity so even though your nurochemicals are normal they don't do what they need to do for your brain."

depression,fctl8hq,t3_eiq1ab,1577947414.0,I just looked at ur drawing and shut up they are amazing I can barley draw a stick figure well. You like to doodle that is a hobby also noticed the shrooms and I took shrooms and now I believe I have regained my ability to be happy. If you look at my recent comments I just have a hard time not talking about how amazing they worked.
depression,fctj351,t1_fcrl92c,1577945024.0,Yeah I always felt bad and even got a little mad at my friends when they felt sorry for me because it wasn't ever there fault. Just it isn't your fault and they just care and don't like it when you feel bad.
depression,fctiw4f,t3_eil5uo,1577944825.0,"If you feel this bad about something that you have zero control of then no faking for you. I am not a mom however due to my experience with them is that they want to get dragged into your problems because your mom always prioritizes you before themselves because they care, and it would be more of a waste of time if you were to not be there. Your mom will most likely never resent you or anything like that because you cause her time and energy. She has been doing that shit since you were born going through hell because she loves you. If moms didn't do that no child would keep their mom past being a teen if they ever made it past toddler. Her perspective of you hasn't changed she has always seen you as her child that she loves and wants to do well in life and be happy."
depression,fctibzu,t3_eip1gj,1577944258.0,"It is not and to answer your second question it used to all the time even thought of ways to do it with the least pain, and I am glad that I never went through with my desires. It doesn't take one event or even a single cause it is often a shit ton of small things that all add up overtime and then it may take a moderately stressful event that on its own will not lead to this severe depression. Also I have found something that helped without me talking to someone although you really need to do that in order to stay well holding it in is never good. Is there anyone that you know that would be understanding and empathetic to your condition. Because I know for a fact that if someone that only talked to my dad about life problems they would never feel like they could talk to anyone because although he listens and cares about me he never understands me, and he also has bad advice on dealing with problems. So you just might need to find someone who you know will understand rather than just someone who is stereotypically talked to like parents."
depression,fcthmr5,t3_eikk9a,1577943575.0,"There is no inherent purpose to live biologically other than to reproduce, but that doesn't mean that it lacks in reason. We aren't designed to be happy most of the time, but we are supposed to have a reward system for a reason to keep us doing smart things to keep alive (drugs can give that reward, but that is not on purpose alive, and when that messes up the desire or rather the lack of a desire to not be here. You just haven't found something that fixes your reward system properly, and that is different for everyone then you will be able to find your purpose to live. I know what helped me and I really love talking about it a small medium dose 2g of magic mushrooms (if you chose this route there are some general things you have to do so it can help you help yourself) and the only way i can describe how effective it was is magical. I went from recently entering a new but really bad epesioide of depression. (it was very episodic for me causing to be okay for a week and then going under again and it kept getting slightly better each time) it wasn't like the others because it was really exaggerated by events that happened causing it to be less just feeling empty and dragged down. To being such incredibly down where it felt like it was a boulder behind me dragging me back. But anyways I took it October 28th and I am still feeling pretty normal and very slowly getting worse at processing my emotions where shit just stresses me out for longer compared to being stressed to calm in about a second to some even very stressful stuff. Just gotta find your depressions Kryptonite. It is strong and powerful and may seem invincible causing you to be hopeless and lost, but just find that Kryptonite like I have for my depression."

Drugs,fctffi5,t1_fcsxo0p,1577941543.0,"I do really want to take MDMA, and good thing I know literally nobody that I can get it from, and when I do eventually get some I plan on testing it for one, and keeping psychically safe. What setting should I take it for the first time. Would a small party with a few friends be fine?"
Drugs,fctf7mk,t1_fct7w1p,1577941341.0,"There is always the rc market, but I don't plan on doing drugs on a vary regular purpose. Also I know that experimentation can def lead to addiction. That is why I ask about what to look out for so I can stop it at its tracks before it becomes a much harder thing. I managed to get out of a very mild (in the sense that I was able to not get really into it but there was cravings and it took much mental strength to throw then out after hiding them and pushing threw every urge)  addiction to high doses of benedryl I have no idea how that substance caused me cravings when it was never fun and I didn't remember/passed out during the main trip. Benadyl can be very addictive somehow."
Drugs,fcteifv,t1_fcsxrz3,1577940707.0,"I am pretty reseliant to peer pressure, and I never do something just to be cool or something like that. I will remain vigilant of people and there motives, but I won't let that get in the way of meeting new people and isolating myself."
Drugs,fcteax2,t1_fcsxhfu,1577940521.0,"I don't plan on using benzos except maybe a couple time just to know what it is like, but I know the withdrawals are very terrible, and I don't like to take anything to help a comedown because if I cant handle a comedown I can't handle the drug.  And i bet you are one of those people that get really affected by weed. I do however want to eventually experience a very strong weed trip like by taking too many edibles. Because i know that weed behaves like mild psychedelic compared to other psychedelics. I do plan on not going overboard with most substances. Except maybe once or twice with psychedelics after a lot of experience with ofcorse someone to watch me with personal experience. I also will not let drugs affect my school directly or indirectly in anyway. School is a priority compared to taking substances so I really can't take benzos on a regular biases if I wanted to."
Drugs,fctdnsw,t1_fct5q4s,1577939963.0,"I have had them help in the past with amazing success. That is why, but I totally agree with all that. I need better coping skills. I am slowly taking up meditation however. Witch I will do soon."
Drugs,fctdiij,t1_fcszptq,1577939837.0,"I know that is what I was planing on doing, but it was free to get so I profited all that I would make. Also i was planing on buying cheap on the onion with weed carts and reselling those due to a high demand compared to the LSD. I only took that low profit percentage because it cost him 3$ and he got 7$ per tab so he only made 1$more than me per unit, and he paid the upfront costs so i would never lose any if i couldn't sell it all. Its a win win because he is on probation for stealing laptops from best buy a few years ago witch means that he just can't get caught or back to juvie."
Drugs,fcsvr1m,t1_fcsthmn,1577926344.0,"Also I am what some would consider popular to to being well liked and just known so I know several drug dealers that have said that they would help. From commission. I actually was going to get 27 units of LSD for free to sell, and I would keep 2, and sell for 10$ getting 30% profit. And him getting 70%. (it cost him 3$ a unit) but he fuking lost it in the bathroom tring to hide it that dumb ass. I am going to go look for it with him when I have the chance. So i would have gotten 75$ for free, and I already new several that wanted some, and was planing on advertising to all the vapers in the bathrooms because they aint snitching and might be intrested."
Drugs,fcsut88,t1_fcstw7o,1577925657.0,Psychedelics are okay though? Because you aint stopping me from tripping every few months or so. Partly for depression treatment

Drugs,fcsujpc,t1_fcsrkjz,1577925467.0,"I know that all if not most drugs can potentially be used without problems. I just want to know what to look out for in the beginning stages of developing a addiction that the obviously biased addiction articles say. Like I know that education is one of the most important harm reduction techniques. I will always learn extensively about a substance and its effects before taking it. I am not using to feel good again because I am pretty happy just having a few things that are troubling me school wise that I am working on with progress. I consider myself  a very intelligent person, and I am comfortable with expressing my feelings just have a hard time doing it because I don't really know. But anyways I just want to learn how to be as safe as I can in the context of addiction because I know how bad addiction can fuck you up. (some are more functional than others, but it still creates a struggle.) I also am going to say that I am 90% sure that I have a higher genetic susceptibility to addiction than average. I bet alcohol is going to be my drug of choice because when ever i get a chance to drink as i said I binge. I also then really want it for the next day. I also want to add that I have very few healthy coping strats (but mushrooms can help with that.) so when ever I feel a little down because of any reason i am drawn to substances. Sorry for the wall of text, but there is so many factors here, and I want to get knowledge that may save my life, and all the dare and parents don't have the knowledge to help. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr I know that abstinence is the best. I don't use to cope. I want to learn. I love alcohol for some reason(i remember learning somewhere that alcoholics get more stimulant properties from it and if they give you a decent bpm increase after (10-15) your susceptibility is higher. I get a high heart rate from alch. I think it was something Peterson that i got that from) I am trying to be smart at stupid things."
Drugs,fcss1xp,t1_fcsr9wy,1577923666.0,Do u have any other advice.
Drugs,fcss17z,t1_fcsr9wy,1577923651.0,"I understand that, and I really know that I shouldn't due to health reasons, but I am very impatient, and very curious, and the 2 combined are a unhealthy combo. There is a few that I am not going to take till later. (mostly the expensive ones I can't quite afford) I am also planing on profiting from these and make a business to pay for fun things, collage, and my car."
