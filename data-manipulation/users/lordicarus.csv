I have a friend who had a son a few months apart from my own son being born. They're both about two years old.

Their son has been out in honestly fucking weird outfits and given weird encouragement towards what can only be referred to as gender neutral bias.

The mom of the other kid insists that she wants to send her kid to private school because in her mind that will be easier for a gay or trans kid to deal with. She buys him gender neutral clothing because she thinks he will probably be trans. She honestly wants her son to be trans so she goes out of her way to enable that.

There is nothing wrong with being trans or gay, I'm 100% with that. I'm not 100% aligned to an extreme on the [gender unicorn](http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/transparentexpedition/files/2017/12/genderunicorn1.jpg) and I'd be 100% supportive if my son turns out to be gay or non-cis gendered.

But this chick is pushing this on her kid. It's a real thing. She wants her son to experience a hardship that is unfortunately real in this world. You can't just be trans or gay, you end up being a pariah to some part of the populace, and she is basically wishing this upon her child.

The point is that using the colloquial meaning you referenced, the source data is not being distorted, but the resultant data (the delta from the avg temp) does shift as you said, which changes the way that resultant data is visualized (things that were blue may be red or vice versa depending on which average you use), which then completely distorts the intended meaning of the visualization.

Choosing 4,8,6 as my avg period would result in deltas of 

-5,-3,-4,-2,-3,-1,1,-2,2,0,3,2,3

If you choose a larger time scale as you are suggesting, then the average temperature will be higher, which would result in the warmer months not seeming so extreme because their difference to the average would be smaller.

Of course it won't completely mask the fact that more recent years are warmer unless there is a period in the past warm enough to make the average temp higher than recent years. You don't seem to be suggesting this though.

That counter top probably gets cleaned rarely and just accumulates bacteria (and allows it to grow by not being cleaned). Then you put something down on that countertop and end up transfering a bunch of bacteria to that thing. Having the counter sealed would certainly not solve the problem, but I'd bet it is at least better by not leaving pores open to just harbor the bacteria and be difficult to clean out.

Or maybe they are no worse than the bacteria on your hands. Maybe OP will prepare a sandwich on that counter top (I realize this is in a bathroom, or at least appears to be) and tell us if he gets sick."
Wellthatsucks,fdkyacx,t1_fdjbq6q,1578513650.0,It's really gross to think of all of the kinds of bacteria living inside the pores of that stone since it obviously isn't sealed.

Isn't it illegal to record people without former consent for entertainment purposes? 

I think they have to actually get consent to do a bit before they can record a ""prank"" which means all of them are more like ""expectant targets"" or more often than not on this show, just back office people pretending to be getting pranked.

I think the only loophole is in calling other radio stations where they are already broadcasting themselves. But I'm not even sure I believe the Tradeio guys are real."
