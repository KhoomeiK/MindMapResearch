You can go back in the air fryer after saucing but you can easily burn them.  I always just toss in a bowl with sauce just prior to plating them up."

airfryer,ffb276c,t1_ff9qhyc,1579749930.0,"Supposedly is right...

I used bp before getting an air fryer and it worked due to the longer, lower cook temps to render the fat and then crisped up with the shorter, higher heat final cook.

I've found that bp does nothing in the air fryer with the much shorter cook times and in fact, if you eat the wings with nothing else on them you'll definitely taste the bp.

If you want a little extra crunch, use a light dusting of corn/potato/sweet potato starch.  Adds a little crunch without affecting the taste."

As much as everyone would love to watch you pop them, it's best to leave them be.  They'll recede and dry up in a day or two if they're not irritated.  
Popping them does nothing beneficial and it could result in infection and further irritation.  
Fire Ants suck!"

airfryer,feuo0aq,t3_eqkkox,1579388385.0,"The air fryer method is so different, and so much more efficient, than cooking in a regular oven or even a convection oven, that you really don't need to add anything to make the wings crispy.

If you are going to add something... a small amount of some type of starch (corn, potato, or sweet potato) will add a nice crunch without changing the flavor like baking powder will."

airfryer,felagis,t3_enwvct,1579217610.0,"It's an air fryer.  For it to have good air circulation it draws in air, heats and circulates and vents it.  Standard ovens vent but not as much.  Convection ovens vent more but still not as much as an air fryer."

You're more likely to have your number considered ""dead"" or unused if it's the service providers default recording.  I forward all unknown calls to voicemail.  If it's really important they'll take the time to leave a recording.

Besides, as someone else noted... who actually uses voicemail any longer.  If my friends or family can't reach me by voice they simply send a text."
