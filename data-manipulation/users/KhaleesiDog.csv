facepalm,fcnf4qk,t3_ei3vms,1577810438.0,"As i see it, the facepalm is the fact that they used 12/31/99, rather than 12/31/1999.  This was the exact reason why it was feared that many systems and applications would crash.  Most dates were stored as two digits, so when the year turned to 2000, these systems would see ‘00’ as ‘1990’, a fatal flaw.

People joke about the Y2K bug as something we overly panicked over.  Believe me, the fears were very well founded, we just did a very good job updating our systems and programs and minimized the damage.  Partly because the issue was identified early and it was *usually* not extremely difficult to remedy.

For example, one of my first jobs was updating an airline automation system for the Y2K issue.  The system was used for airline accounting and parts maintenance.  Each of the millions of parts in an aircraft have to be accounted for with respect to flight time and warranty information to determine when to change them out.  Imagine if the system wasn’t updated; each part in every aircraft in several fleets would automatically expire and be sent for reorder.

Ok, planes falling out of the sky, etc... maybe not. But the implications in banking, security, databases, well... you get it.  Anything that relied on a year that was represented by only two digits was F’d.
