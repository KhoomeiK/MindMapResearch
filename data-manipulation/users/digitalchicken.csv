AskReddit,ffq6bq1,t1_ffq3t9i,1580122859.0,"Not famous, but I was deeply affected by a woman’s rape and murder around 10 years ago. I was working in a newsroom and it was a massive story. I think it resonated with me being a woman. She was walking home from the pub (500m from home). CCTV footage saw her walk past, and then the guy who killed her a few minutes later chasing her. I used to look up to the stars and tell her how sorry I was. Had trouble sleeping too."

AskReddit,ffq3pww,t1_ffq3jyb,1580118754.0,"I had a guy say “I want to know about sleepers” so I asked what he’d like to know. He said “you’re not very good at listening, are you?” I said “excuse me? Do you want pricing, technical info?” He just kept telling me to work on my listening skills, so I hung up. Fuck that asshole."
AskReddit,ffq3gks,t1_ffpp97c,1580118330.0,"I have done this, only to have the customer call back. My colleague answered and copped an earful. Once I got the same guy who complained I hung up on him, so I told him I wouldn’t if he’d stop being so rude. Transferred him to my supervisor who agreed he was a piece of shit. 

I’ve been told gently by managers they understand, but to stop hanging up on customers. No, I’m too old to be spoken to like shit by some old fucker who thinks he’s better than me. The amount of times men have spoken down to and ridiculed me is ridiculous."
AskReddit,ffq384h,t1_ffpik69,1580117949.0,"Yep. We had a man walk into our office asking to see a display (we sell concrete retaining wall products). We explained we don’t have a display at our office, but he would need to visit a different branch (35-40 minutes away). 

Man got very upset and complained about how our website stated that our office was a display centre and we should update it. My colleague apologised, I gave him the address for the other branch and he left. Cue confusion as she pulls up our website and nowhere did it say we were a display centre..."

AskReddit,ffpeabv,t3_eu725g,1580092889.0,"I was 13 and in Australia. I woke up for school and it was all over the news. My Dad said “half of America has been blown up!” It was horrifying and confusing, and school felt weird that day. I kept watching the news reports and it made me cry.

AskReddit,ffpe1a0,t1_ffmk7jh,1580092709.0,"My partners cousin is one of my closest friends, but fuck playing games with her. She’s insufferable and a very bad loser/winner. It ruins the fun. I’ve told my partner I no longer want to play games with her, as I always end up feeling like shit. (For the record I enjoy card games etc, I just don’t care if I lose or win. I don’t have a competitive bone in my body.)

Once her and her partner won a round of Pictionary and started playing we are the champions while waving a lighter. We won the next round and she started sulking and saying how much she hated the game. 

Super competitive people suck."

AskReddit,ffjjdnz,t1_ffhwcls,1579999551.0,"My manager tried to tell me Saturday shifts were built into my contract. They aren’t. The family business I was working for was bought out by a national company, and the old company opened for 3 hours on a Saturday morning. 

There were four of us who shared the shift, so one Saturday a month. When the business was taken over, they laid off two of the girls so it was just myself and another colleague who were made to do those shifts, plus working full time. 

The new company are refusing to get other workers to help because none of the other branches open on the weekends and they weren’t contracted to do them. 

My colleague got angry and told our manager Saturday’s aren’t built into our contract at all, that’s why we get paid over time. They promised it would only be for a few months and then made it permanent. Plus she’s been doing 7-4pm Monday to Friday because we are so short staffed, then expected to come in at 8am on a Saturday."
