I have a factory Beretta OEM 9mm barrel and a few OEM 9mm mags I’ve been using in my 96A1 for a few years now and probably have close to 700 rounds of 9mm thru it (including some steel case) and it’s been perfect. In fact, I’ve never had a single malfunction in about 2,000 rounds or so of both .40 and 9mm and I bought it used. One of my favorite pistols."

Let’s say you’re looking for a new holster for your 19 so you check out a bunch of different sites for holsters. Some prices are normal, some seem expensive, others have so-so reviews. One day you check Bravo Concealment or somewhere and that particular weekend they’re having a flash sale or they’re blowing out old inventory for half price. You order yours and if you’re so inclined, you post a link to what you found for others to enjoy the savings.

Head over to r/gundeals and keep an eye out for cases of 1,000 rounds. It seems like a lot to a new shooter but it really isn’t. Spending $170-180 might seem excessive compared to only $10 or $20 but like most things, you save by buying in bulk. 16-18¢ a round in bulk vs 20¢ a round at a store or 25¢ each round if you buy ammo at the range.

One of my coworkers was a Federal Air Marshal for a few years and has, and I quote, “a lot” of .357 Sig ammo. I again asked how much is a lot and he said “it’s... a lot”. Haven’t seen him in awhile but I told him I’d trade a bottle or two of Maker’s Mark for a can or two of ammo. Just a barrel swap away from a 3rd caliber and nerve damage!


3 calibers in one and now with the price of 22’s dropping further, it’s starting to become the better value. If mine is doing nightstand duty, it’ll be in OEM .40 configuration. Regardless of what this sub erroneously thinks, .40 is an excellent self/home defense caliber and 15 rounds of 180gr JHP rounds is pretty much good to go in my book."

Glocks are a perfect example. Since the mid 90’s or so, Glocks have taken over the law enforcement world so there’s a few generations of people who have trained on pistols with no external safety and gotten used to it. Me, for example. My duty weapon of the last 11 years has no external safety. 11 years of quarterly quals, drills, range trips, thousands of reputations and rounds downrange. My next duty weapon is gonna be a Glock so most of that training will carry over. More repetition, more drills, more rounds. 



You put a service pistol with a manual safety on it that’s required to be manually engaged while holstered? In a high stress situation, you may as well shoot me yourself cuz I’ll be a goner.
