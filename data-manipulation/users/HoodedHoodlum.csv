headphones,ff0bpnm,t1_feymt1u,1579467335.0,"One thing to note is that they have a pretty big null in the frequency response, I forget what frequency exactly, but it's around upper midrange/lower treble area.

I've been wanting to audition a Monet for a few years now, but of course with them being a Japan exclusive (until recently), of course it never happened. I hope FitEar releases a universal version, if they haven't already. Would love to try a pair.

Can you go into the Titan's signature a little bit more? How is the bass and midrange performance relative to the treble?"

It would be super cool if a plastic replacement can be produced, out of, say, wood or other cellulose fibers, that can be injection molded like plastic, but of course it's a natural material. Something that's not nasty like MDF."

headphones,fctdbnf,t1_fcstr03,1577939669.0,"I think storage plays a big role in how long they'll last. If properly stored, electret drivers shouldn't have charge issues.


Anecdotal, but I have a pair of Rotel RH-930 headphones (an OEM of Toshiba HR-810), and they sound pretty damn good for their age, no channel imbalance issues. They're in great condition aside from some minor dings on the grilles.


I also have a pair of bass-heavy version of the AKG K 340. I snagged them for pretty cheap on eBay. Cosmetic condition is great, aside from dust, as they were kept in a plastic container bin with a bunch of other stuff for who-knows-how-long in I presume a garage. Now, that pair definitely had imbalance issues with the electret drivers, with one driver being much more quiet throughout the midrange than the other. I feel like being stored in a garage is what might have messed up the drivers. I tried replacing the resistors used in the small transformers in the cups, but that did not work. Now, the electret drivers do not produce any sound.


There are two types of electret drivers, the better sounding and better performing back-electret, like those used in the Rotel; the other being bi-polar electrets, like those used in the STAX electret series.


Here's a quote from a thread I read: ""contrary to popular belief, electrets do not ""lose charge"" over time except in the geological time scale. However, the A-T/Stax design has a tendency to build up a capacitance that cannot be drained, which saps their sensitivity over time. You can read all about that in Sony's Uni-Electret patent.""

headphones,fcj712f,t1_fciz0l9,1577678857.0,"Well, the PreSonus Eris E5 are studio monitor speakers (I have a pair as well). Yes, placement matters, especially with monitors. The closer they are to a wall, the more ""boomy"" the bass will be, among other effects to the sound, like odd reflections. Whether they are ported in the front or back will also affect placement requirements. Also true if you have them in the corner of a room, like the speaker in the main OP's pic. Having them in a corner like that, and close to the walls as well, will exagerrate the bass response."
headphones,fcj664h,t1_fciukb2,1577678240.0,"Yes, that's why I mentioned it at the end of my comment."
