WTF,fg8hc8k,t3_exfsca,1580619507.0,Just wait till you see what people wear when driving scooters in Vietnam. Full on homemade head gear to try to stay pale.
todayilearned,fg7sdqi,t3_ex8v5e,1580600280.0,"Just walking down the street in Vietnam, you still see the effects of agent orange. Dwarfism is common to see but that's honestly the luckiest side effect. Lots of people are forced to drag themselves around on makeshift skateboards due to having misshapen or underdeveloped limbs. They basically make their living by getting donations from shocked tourists who have never seen deformities like that"
fatlogic,fg6gz2x,t3_ex0uow,1580567695.0,"I'm against dieting because dieting is a temporary attempt.
Yes, people gain weight back after dieting because it's a temporary change in consumption

So in that way, sure.

However I am for a change in lifestyle. 

Eat less, move more is not a diet. It's a lifestyle change. And I hear a lot of obese people say they can't move more because of so many issues. 

They have movement based exercise diets based on people who are 700 lbs. They have movement based exercise routines on elderly, on paraplegic, on quadraplegic people.

 Whenever they say they can't exercise because of their ankles or whatever disability, I just think of all the exercise programs build for people who are either 90 or have literally lost the ability to move half their bodies"

trashy,fg6dfxc,t3_ex3enl,1580564612.0,"I quite literally have a couple like this who lives in my apartment.

You would think them living there meant they would do this inside, right?

Nope, often too high to find the keys to get into the apartment, which results in late night screaming matches about sex and drugs when she's too fucked to get inside 

And kicker is, she owns the apartment due to an inheritance so we can't do anything"
trashy,fg6cz10,t3_ewyplg,1580564147.0,"So my husband had an experience like this. He was at a local bar years ago, where some women were having some kind of party. Wedding or birthday or whatever, he didn't know 

At one point, he pulled off his hoodie which yanked his t-shirt up as well. Whatever, all good 

Weeks later, he got a friend request. It was a girl from the party. We live in a small town so he accepted, not knowing she was from the party but seeing she had mutual friends 

He creeped her profile to see who she was, and she had photos from that party. Photos of him taking off his hoodie and exposing his stomach, chest and back. Her captions were similar to like ""yeah boy take it off ""

He asked her to remove those cause wtf. She said she was just looking and he should be complimented about it. No, he was not complimented. He was freaking creeped out that he couldn't take off his hoodie at his neighborhood bar without someone taking pictures, posting them and then ADDING HIM TO FB as if that was super cool. 

She was all confused he didn't want to talk to her"

ComedyCemetery,fg6be1y,t3_ex42jp,1580562483.0,"So I came back from China on January 8th. I only had a layover in China, so I was in Beijing airport like 6 hours 

I did two weeks of shifts before I came down with a flu/cold. 

I called in my first shift about 18 days after being back, but then went to my second. Everyone kept calling me chinagirl and asking about my bat soup. I kept joking about bringing bat soup to the next potluck. Keep in mind everyone knows I'm vegetarian, so I figured it would be a big joke 

Everyone kept asking me if I needed Lyme disease to go with my coronavirus. 

I called in my third shift because going to work with a cold made me feel worse and my husband was feeling ill. I received a call from work saying I'm not allowed back because there were ""concerns brought up"" at work. I have to get cleared by a doctor to go back."
todayilearned,fg6b64a,t1_fg6b3cs,1580562233.0,Honestly most likely. People don't look into this stuff so many organizations don't pay out and get used to that.

Still confused as to OPs initial question though."
