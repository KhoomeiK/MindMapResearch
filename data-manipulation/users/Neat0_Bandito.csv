I know that this will take a while, seeing as you're in high school, but when you can, leave. Don't look back. You especially need to cut your father out of your life. Don't even tell him where you're going, just tell him that you have to go. Trust me, there are a lot of fellow gay people who will support you, all you need to do is find them. It will get easier. High school just fucking sucks, and you're dad is an asshole. The sooner you can leave them both behind, the better.

These kinds of people have low standards for friends, and are willing to accept you, no matter how worthless you think you are, because they feel the same way. We are all in this together. I'm sure there are plenty of lonely people who would love to have a friend, and would be happy to ignore any flaws you think you have."
