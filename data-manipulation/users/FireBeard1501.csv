CasualConversation,fek1djv,t1_fek0ymw,1579190520.0,Yup snowboarding is easy enough but only if you go to the right types of slopes. You want wide ones with a steady decline and no flat or inclined areas because that's where the edge gets caught and you get stuck and are likely to fall. I was on blue slopes my first day of snowboarding just a few weeks ago.
CasualConversation,fek0val,t1_fek02i9,1579190209.0,You just lean on one edge of the board or the other until it's parallel to the bottom of the slope. The more parallel it is the slower you'll go.
