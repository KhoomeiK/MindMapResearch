fatlogic,fd59ey3,t1_fd53o7q,1578175374.0,"Going vegan doesn't help either if you overeat. Palm oil is part of the reason the rainforests are being destroyed, and its plant based. The whole midwestern US is overloaded with pesticides and runoff and they mostly grow corn and soybeans there."
fatlogic,fd57mf0,t1_fd4ywhw,1578174982.0,"There's also the damage to the planet. The pesticides from growing crops causes birth defects in much of the developing world. There are whole rivers and sections of ocean that are uninhabitable. My extended family lives in the midwest and has told me that there have been days where they have to boil their drinking water because it is contaminated from pesticides and crop waste from all the corn that is grown to be made into corn syrup. Parts of the Mississippi river are a dead zone from all the waste. Much of the destruction of the rainforests worldwide is for cows and palm oil. The latter is used in junk food.

There was an episode of My 600lb Life that made my blood boil because the guy - who was already mean to his father and brother - was snarfing down like 12 pizzas a day. All I could think was there are tons of people who could be fed those pizzas and here is one guy eating them, and he is 800 lbs."

fatlogic,fd4mjnb,t1_fd2fhe7,1578168917.0,"Purely a personal account, but it doesn't always reverse diabetes. My dad has type 2. He was barely Obese Class I at the time of diagnosis, so he wasn't huge. He recently got stage 4 cancer of the esophagus. He went from Obese Class I to underweight within a year. He's in remission now. He still has type 2, but only needs metformin. Before he was on metformin, some other med, and insulin. So the weight loss helped, but it did not cure him."
fatlogic,fcfga9a,t3_edbem6,1577629670.0,"When you fut into a small size small tunic from free people but aren’t actually small it’s not true to size. It runs huge. 

If I see more reviews of “I’m plus size and 200lbs and size XS fit me do this tunic is true to size” posts on the clothing websites I’m going to scream. 

Companies need to provide measurements for clothes. The reviews are becoming pointless."
fatlogic,fa99d5b,t1_fa31zpg,1575865958.0,"What states will cover varies from state to state. I moved from a red state to a blue one. The red state definitely required that families be more impoverished to qualify for healthcare for the children. And that red state's network for people who qualify is abysmal. I don't know why vldsa is getting downvoted so hard for stating that states differ in their coverage. And the south isn't that great about covering people. Kentucky was in the news last year because its governor was pretty much trying to cut the state's medical program for the poor to the bone.

Personally I resent the 'go see the doctor' thing so much because I don't have health insurance right now but last time I did it would have been $25 out of pocket to  'go see the doctor' and ask them about my weight.

It is far cheaper for a teenager in America to ask random internet strangers about health issues than it is to go see a doctor. Even with health insurance. Not to mention the waiting for the appointment if you do go and see a doctor. I've lost track of the number of times friends, family, and coworkers have ended up at instacare because their doctor wasn't available for an entire month and they had a pressing medical issue that needed to be dealt with more promptly."
