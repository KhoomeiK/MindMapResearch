Cimzia,fgjlnw4,t1_fg82rn8,1580846596.0,"Sudden increase in inflammation/symptoms. Can last days, weeks or months before subsiding to normal levels. Many people need medical intervention on their first one though."
rheumatoid,fgg5elk,t3_ey76jl,1580754622.0,My experience says joint pain will not resolve if I keep using the joint (or at least not for subtantially longer than if I gave it a rest). When I was seeing a physiotherapist and needed to work through an injury he warmed the joint before exercise and iced it afterwards to prevent additional inflammation from developing.
rheumatoid,fgg4fdx,t3_ey95c5,1580754025.0,"I found taking the mtx on a full stomach helped a lot. The hungrier I was the worse the nausea got (ironic). Ginger is good, I also had some success with peppermint tea. Also find the injections way easier than the pills. I found that once my system got used to the mtx the nausea stopped being all the time and became the 24hrs after my dose. If you know when you are going to feel bad having your meals prepped before helps."
rheumatoid,fgg3312,t3_ey9fam,1580753202.0,"Depression/anxiety and RA feed on each other. High inflammation can make depression/anxiety worse and stress can trigger inflammation flare ups. Now that you have been diagnosed hopefully getting the RA medicated will make the other better. The period right before and after my diagnosis were the absolute worst for me but things have been gradually improving in the years since then (most of the time, there are still some days that suck but it's no longer every day).  I hope you can start seeing some improvements soon."

I didn't see big improvements right away but gradual over a few months. One morning I got up and realized I'd been getting around better for about a week. Last month I only flared when my period started which is a huge improvement (1-3 per week has been normal for the last few years, milder when on other meds but never gone)."

funny,fg3jnf9,t1_fg25qy0,1580483131.0,"My dad too, he asked if he could watch during. Seeing something he hadn't seen before trumped risk of pain. Also said it wasn't too bad."
rheumatoid,ffzrn2s,t1_ffxephq,1580390903.0,"Some flares are worse than others. I agree with you but if you can get proof of inflammation it can help getting a diagnosis even if the rheumy isn't the best. I had trouble getting a referral to a rheumatologist, there has to be a reason why other doctors are suspecting rheumatoid. The wait to see a rheumatologist makes it hard to guarantee symptoms on the day of the appointment if they come and go."
AskReddit,ffzoajt,t1_ffwzj7z,1580387847.0,"In 20 yrs I've seen a large corporation use experienced employees to train new employees then had the original employees let go twice on a large scale to reduce the salary budget (you don't need a reason if you lay off a whole department, they just need different job titles to do this legally or at least in a way that you cannot prove that it was illegal). It's difficult to restart in the job market in your 50s (especially if it's a specialized skill set) so I can see why some people would be resistant to basically train their replacements. I see far more acceptance when employees are asked to apprentice their replacement after they have a set retirement date than when it is still years out. Job security is hard to come by in today's job market."
rheumatoid,ffxa2m8,t3_evngk2,1580320893.0,"Try to get the specific reasons why the doctors think it is rheumatoid. There are lots of seronegative rheumatoid patients (nothing in blood work), it's just a whole lot harder to get the diagnosis. Is there visible inflammation sometime, just not when you got to the rheumatologist? If so, see if you can get a photo of it. Log everything, every symptom every day, what helps, what doesn't. Also ask the rheumatologist why they don't think it is rheumatoid. It's frustrating that as the patient you basically need to know as much as a doctor about your own illness to be able to advocate for yourself."

AskReddit,ffql1yu,t1_ffpbh7t,1580137478.0,"The most sustainable changes are small ones, things you can live with for the rest of your life. I lost my first 10 lbs by switching from pop/juice to water (other than 1 cup of coffee and/or 1 cup of tea per day I only drink water, if you take cream/sugar gradually reduce how much). Gradually add more vegetables, a small salad before you eat lunch or cook dinner can help you fill up on lower calorie foods (in the winter cabbage soup is a nice warm alternate and freezes very well). Figure out what you can give up without missing it and what you are going to keep craving and work it into your plan. I went from a large pizza once per week (two people) to a medium once per month. A tub of ice cream to a scoop (fun date night treat). I added vegetables (spinach, zucchini mostly, already had mushrooms) to my pasta sauce (and chilli) and replaced half the noodles with spagetti squash (was not as good with just squash and still left me craving but worked well together). When I make tacos I replace half the meat with cauliflower and reduced the cheese by half but added more lettuce and tomato.


Remember, you didn't gain the weight over night, don't expect to lose it that way. Diet is where you will do most of it, they are not kidding when they say you cannot out run a bad diet. Exercise gets easier as you lose the weight so worry about that first. If you maintain a healthy diet 90% of the time you will still make progress, give yourself a break sometimes (I'm still going to have my turkey dinner with all the trimmings every thanksgiving with my family and my turkey with stuffing sandwiches the day after). I also eat comfort food when I'm sick, can be a good time to try eating at maintenance anyway."

Pets,ffprsgu,t1_ffp76if,1580103396.0,"Try to keep your routine the same as much as possible too, so she always knows where to find you until she is secure in the new location. It may also help to tire her out right before you go to bed (play then feed) so she sleeps as long as possible at night. Maybe also consider a night light that you turn on whenever you are in bed so she has a visual cue she can see from outside the room."
Pets,ffpqtb3,t3_euajit,1580102459.0,"Change in behavior could indicate a health issue.

We medicated (basically supplements) and put steps to their favorite spots that required big jumps and they went back to normal behavior."

It was intermittent so seemed wrong and we didn't think we had anything running that would emit carbon monoxide (summer, furnace was off and runs on oil, electric stove). They were nice about it and sent the fire department to confirm just in case. Turns out the detector had an indictor alarm to tell you it's not working anymore so you know to replace it (does the same for low battery but we checked that before calling)."
AskReddit,ffdgflm,t1_ffc4zd9,1579820337.0,"Depends on health and traffic. If you have a busy city commute with lots of stop and go it gets tiring to be constantly in/out/changing gears.
