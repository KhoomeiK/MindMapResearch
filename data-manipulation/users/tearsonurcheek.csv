How can *anyone* not directly benefitting from his grift think he's even remotely the right man for the job?

""We need a successful businessman to run our country.""

1) Running a business is not the same as running the country. Some of the skills might translate, but running a successful non-profit might be a better fit. A business focuses on making a profit. Government handles things you can't (or can't ethically) make a profit doing. Business can do things, like raise rates, that government can't easily do.

2) How is a man that bankrupted several businesses, including the license to print money that is the (multiple) casino(s), had multiple ventures shut down due to fraud, and had to settle *multiple* lawsuits due to fraud, even on the same *planet* as the definition of a successful businessman?
