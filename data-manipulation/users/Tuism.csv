OculusQuest,ffhz7x4,t1_ffhu8b0,1579960055.0,"Interesting, sometimes I see it flashing and I wasn't sure what the conditions was. But in the video they got up there, you can see a slight lit spot in those cut out parts, is that some cameras picking up IR lights?"
OculusQuest,ffhnnl1,t3_etl8q4,1579944137.0,How did you get to see through the controller's own plastic to see where the tracking lights were?

VR social needs to be ready player one."
OculusQuest,ffhjt7g,t3_etjzqb,1579938515.0,"The problem isn't that To The Top wasn't allowed. The problem is that they flat out don't give well-received titles any route into the store, and the one pretend route almost does literally nothing unless you're basically already minting money with your title.

But then they SAY you must pitch before you even start working on your game.

I'd like to see just even a single game that got through that curation process by pitching before they even started, without coming from a group that already had got titles or AAA backing.

It's a farce and that's annoying for developers. For users who don't give a shit about developers, yeah sure it's great.

OculusQuest,ffer07m,t1_ffepmg5,1579861206.0,I wonder what their user/sales numbers are like in Asia.
OculusQuest,ffep8xg,t1_ffeoote,1579858549.0,"I dunno if it's as simple as you say it is. It's not ""always there"", right now it's entirely only ever in the is layer that can't be touched by anything else. I dunno if they can do a display layer that must be blind to the developer (show only to user but never accessible via, say, rendertexture). I at least have never seen it in unity."
OculusQuest,ffeol0s,t1_ffennqg,1579857548.0,"Same difference. If they open it up to be displayed, the developer can render it out via any number of means and gain access to it.

So unless they crack that security lockdown layer, I doubt they would let anyone have access to passthrough."
virtualreality,ffeo6mi,t1_ffek1o5,1579856944.0,"So like, when you crouch IRL, the in-game view just stops going down, restricted, but everything else moves like normal?

OculusQuest,ffbs1uk,t1_ff9mx6w,1579780548.0,"This seems like a self-defeating prophecy. Oculus rejects things, they go to Sidequest. If they want something they only have to snap their fingers and I'm almost 200% sure the dev in question will abandon Sidequest for the main store."

polyamory,fewjhgr,t3_eqlc72,1579411871.0,"At the end of the day, what you consciously want and what your feelings are can often be at odds. And it takes time to adjust, even if you know what you want. That is even if you do.

You guys have been dating six months, which is a relatively short time. It sounded like she has given you an ultimatum in saying that she must be able to consider that possibility despite the two of you having started off in a monogamous agreement (you didn't state that explicitly but it sounded like it, if you guys didn't even discuss what form the relationship would take then it really should have happened), so your decision space is whether you are okay with that, and whether you want that.

And even if you want that, it will take a lot of time and adjustment, and support from your partner for you to be comfortable with it. And she must also support you through it in a way you can be satisfied with. It's a bi-directional trust thing.

But yeah, as flippant as it sounds, you have to be able to consider ending the relationship if what's on the table is not what you want, or is able to make you comfortable. YOU have to take care of yourself first."
polyamory,fet81j6,t1_fesmtux,1579372604.0,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but is it normal to bring up something as huge as "" asking if I'd be able to accept her having a baby with my husband"" early on in a relationship? It feels like a bit of a red flag if someone was in any way serious about a question like that before it was even near a stable relationship?"
