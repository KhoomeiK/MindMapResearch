NintendoSwitch,ffd8cw3,t1_ffd74u7,1579815403.0,"My only complaint with the pro controller, I would love if it would be a tad bit bigger. Just a tad.

The Wii U pro controller is in my opinion one of the comfiest controllers I’ve ever used, they really nailed it. It’s slightly bigger than the Switch pro controller and both joysticks are at the top of the controller instead of one at the top and one at bottom."

NintendoSwitchDeals,ff723g8,t1_ff02ios,1579639583.0,"And that’s exactly why I support my LGS. All used sought after switch games (think Smash, BOTW, Luigis mansion 3) are flat priced at 42.99. Good luck getting one but I’d rather hunt instead of paying GameStop’s $55"

GameDeals,felw0nn,t1_fel0ppg,1579232339.0,Because it’s a liability. The second you have an employee that fucks up and says something dumb or against the player base you’ve got a shit storm on your hands.

science,fein1b8,t1_feil4a9,1579142352.0,"It’s been coming out more and more lately that the “sodium is incredibly bad for you” thing has been entirely overblown. 

One study I read basically stated that unless you have some genetic factors (like high blood pressure) you shouldn’t worry much about it."
aww,fei7vg7,t1_fei6at5,1579132241.0,"And again, another person that has no understanding of the situation regarding zoos, we aren’t stuffing them in cages just to stuff them in cages, there are multiple species that wouldn’t even be on this earth anymore if it weren’t for zoos and breeding programs. 

Zoos are not inherently bad if they are ran correctly and animals are treated properly. As time goes on zoos will be the only thing stopping certain species from going extinct completely."

pics,feh76jg,t1_fego098,1579110569.0,"Doomer never has and never will be about people concerned with climate. 

It’s about a depressed person who can’t find joy in anything or anyone, works a dead end job with no hopes or aspirations and is usually addicted to alcohol and cigarettes and wants it all to end. Where did you get climate change?

Edit: just looked it up, apparently doomer is an actual term for people who are hopeless about climate change, but it is 100% not what this meme is about"
