AnimalsBeingDerps,feipq4u,t3_ep8ier,1579144148.0,Hahahaa oh goodness the noises I made watching this video for the first time. Why is this so funny?
UnresolvedMysteries,fefocxu,t3_eoqkvz,1579060776.0,"I don't get it. I read in the comments that the parents did not report him as missing the first day, they knew he ran away previously and hid in abandoned houses, and he was found in the house across the street? That would be the first place I would look. That poor boy. According to his YT video, he had a shitty home life. I hope he did not suffer for long.
RIP Harley"
