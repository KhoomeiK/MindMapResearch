You're arguing of the likelihood we reached the end result in the same exact manner, not just in any manner.

A primordial soup, some reaction, bam lonely amino acids. More reactions, two amino acids bump into each other, hey presto we're better than 1! Let's keep bumping.

Down the line, some basic bacteria can reproduce better if it can process different stuff, it outcompetes bam evolution.

Eventually we get multi-celled organisms to fill a niche.

Eventually larger and larger.

It's a series of very logical stes, but arguing against the likelihood of that specific set of steps occuring is not a valid criticism of the theory of evolution.

For example, the odds of you having a specific birthday are 1 in 365ish, the odds of you sharing a birthday with someone in a room of 23 people is 1 in 16ish, but the odds of any two people sharing a birthday are 1 in 2.  
Obviously that doesn't translate perfectly, but the point is that while the odds of forming a specific protein might be low, the odds of forming **any** protein is quite reasonable given that there are millions and millions of possible protein combinations.

There's nothing special about a protein, really. It's just a chain of amino acids that perform some function. So really, the odds are more like... inevitable.

I'm happy to hear your counterpoints that probably involve a tornado and a junkyard, your explanation for how intelligently we were 'designed' to excrete waste with our sexual organs, and why we can die from temporarily clogging our food hole (because we have to shove food into our wind hole or we die anyways)."

pics,ffdozid,t1_ffdnutx,1579825552.0,"I spoke the truth and will die on that hill.

There is no way to cook a sirloin or new york strip steak well done that isn't tough and/or dry.

A ribeye could still be eehhhhhh if it were particularly fatty and sliced thin, and a tenderloin would probably be edible. I mean I'd eat them, but I wouldn't feel great about it.


If you want a good steak but prefer well done, you need to go for thinner cuts.

The real disconnect is that most people don't know what well done is truly like, because when  people order well done at a restaurant, they're served mid well. If they were served well done, they would (with few exceptions) complain about how bad it was.  
So they think they like well, but they don't. 

Similarly, many people think they like mid rare but actually like medium, because many restaurants (even some steakhouses) tend towards cooking everything towards medium/mid well. When given an actual medium rare, they would call it rare."

Very fun with friends though.

https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ervzj5/be_happy/ff6o1iz"
gaming,ff6o1iz,t1_ff6d0bj,1579631292.0,"Honestly it *should be*, but it just falls flat.

So much breadth but lacking depth. We have this very complicated UI and crafting system but without any intelligence (aka, roasted vegetables required a pan, you cannot use a pot).

You can forage stones to make a stone axe... but it has to be a sharp stone. And you can't knap two stones to make a sharp stone. Can't use bone. Can't do makeshift metal axes, etc.

There are carpentry and metalworking skills, and just about everything you see can be dismantled and yet you can't build even a fraction of what you see. Buildings are not destructible and do not decay, meaning that building a zombie-proof floating fortress is trivial, rendering those skills even more obsolete.

There are no NPC survivors. At all. Some friendly, some hostile, camps, trading, etc would really spice things up.

Combat, especially shooting, feels super clunky. There are no reach-weapons (spears, halberds, etc) and very few craftable traps (pitfalls, nets, tripwires, etc). Aiming is frustrating and seems random. Sometimes I'll hit 10 shots in a row, other times I'll miss 10 in a row. When firing at a mob of zombies.

Where's the armor? Even a padded jacket offers no protection against bites and scratches. Why can't I forge some chainmail or something?

There are just so many pieces missing from the game. I think they'll get around to it, but they clearly don't have a large staff, so we're talking years and years before it's close to feature-complete.

It is fun though, despite all that, especially with friends.

Also note that some of the things I listed (not all) can be addressed with mods, but of course expanding menus and adding NPCs causes some serious slowdowns, hanging, and even crashes."

Blocking was as simple as timing, and was omnidirectional. This made fighting mobs of enemies (nekkers, ghouls, drowners, etc) a complete joke, rather than a harrowing experience. As a result, monsters that couldn't be blocked were significantly more difficult. Except...

Rolling and dodging is your 'get out of jail free' button. You're inexplicably invulnerable during a roll, and attacks tend to miss while dodging (even if they go right through you).  

There's no real benefit to alternating your attacks. Quick attacks do significantly higher DPS, and power attacks seem to only exist just so you can have 2 attacks.

Signs recharged much too quickly but were not meaningful enough even if you specced into sign intensity. Yeah eventually you got some pretty scary igni, but yrden and aard were set damage values based on skill level. Also quen was far too strong at any given time.

Bombs also suffered from the fact they did set damage. There were a few skills that buffed them, but they were largely a disappointment.

Oils were implemented in a very disappointing way. I understand they wanted to reduce the tedium of meditating to prepare and apply oils, and they fact you had to know what was coming in advance in order to properly make use of them... but now you have a bottomless bottle of oil that needs to be reapplied mid-combat for no reason. Should either be unlimited or not, because making me open the inventory mid-combat is not good design."

You put two pencils far apart on a table, one 'missing link'.  
Add a pencil in the middle. Two missing links.  
Add two pencils at the two midpoints of the 'missing links'. Four missing links.

And so on until it's a solid line of pencils which just means dozens of missing links.

You're arguing of the likelihood we reached the end result in the same exact manner, not just in any manner.

A primordial soup, some reaction, bam lonely amino acids. More reactions, two amino acids bump into each other, hey presto we're better than 1! Let's keep bumping.

Down the line, some basic bacteria can reproduce better if it can process different stuff, it outcompetes bam evolution.

Eventually we get multi-celled organisms to fill a niche.

Eventually larger and larger.

It's a series of very logical stes, but arguing against the likelihood of that specific set of steps occuring is not a valid criticism of the theory of evolution.

For example, the odds of you having a specific birthday are 1 in 365ish, the odds of you sharing a birthday with someone in a room of 23 people is 1 in 16ish, but the odds of any two people sharing a birthday are 1 in 2.  
Obviously that doesn't translate perfectly, but the point is that while the odds of forming a specific protein might be low, the odds of forming **any** protein is quite reasonable given that there are millions and millions of possible protein combinations.

There's nothing special about a protein, really. It's just a chain of amino acids that perform some function. So really, the odds are more like... inevitable.

I'm happy to hear your counterpoints that probably involve a tornado and a junkyard, your explanation for how intelligently we were 'designed' to excrete waste with our sexual organs, and why we can die from temporarily clogging our food hole (because we have to shove food into our wind hole or we die anyways)."

There is no way to cook a sirloin or new york strip steak well done that isn't tough and/or dry.

A ribeye could still be eehhhhhh if it were particularly fatty and sliced thin, and a tenderloin would probably be edible. I mean I'd eat them, but I wouldn't feel great about it.


If you want a good steak but prefer well done, you need to go for thinner cuts.

The real disconnect is that most people don't know what well done is truly like, because when  people order well done at a restaurant, they're served mid well. If they were served well done, they would (with few exceptions) complain about how bad it was.  
So they think they like well, but they don't. 

Similarly, many people think they like mid rare but actually like medium, because many restaurants (even some steakhouses) tend towards cooking everything towards medium/mid well. When given an actual medium rare, they would call it rare."

Very fun with friends though. 

Here's a long comment I made. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ervzj5/be_happy/ff6o1iz"
gaming,ff6o1iz,t1_ff6d0bj,1579631292.0,"Honestly it *should be*, but it just falls flat.

So much breadth but lacking depth. We have this very complicated UI and crafting system but without any intelligence (aka, roasted vegetables required a pan, you cannot use a pot).

You can forage stones to make a stone axe... but it has to be a sharp stone. And you can't knap two stones to make a sharp stone. Can't use bone. Can't do makeshift metal axes, etc.

There are carpentry and metalworking skills, and just about everything you see can be dismantled and yet you can't build even a fraction of what you see. Buildings are not destructible and do not decay, meaning that building a zombie-proof floating fortress is trivial, rendering those skills even more obsolete.

There are no NPC survivors. At all. Some friendly, some hostile, camps, trading, etc would really spice things up.

Combat, especially shooting, feels super clunky. There are no reach-weapons (spears, halberds, etc) and very few craftable traps (pitfalls, nets, tripwires, etc). Aiming is frustrating and seems random. Sometimes I'll hit 10 shots in a row, other times I'll miss 10 in a row. When firing at a mob of zombies.

Where's the armor? Even a padded jacket offers no protection against bites and scratches. Why can't I forge some chainmail or something?

There are just so many pieces missing from the game. I think they'll get around to it, but they clearly don't have a large staff, so we're talking years and years before it's close to feature-complete.

It is fun though, despite all that, especially with friends.

It's not that nobody noticed, it's that nobody gives a fuck because it's not noteworthy."
gaming,femrbnw,t1_felbgz4,1579267365.0,"There are some combat mods, the best would be one that removes the forced target lock in combat so you can move around and swing freely, not just directly at a target."
gaming,femr8uk,t1_felb4jz,1579267296.0,"The combat with W3 is not great and pretty shallow. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but it's not perfect at all.

You were locked onto a target which meant that all the grace and movement of your attacks were meaningless.  
I modded that out, now I can flow through combat, and even 'swing around' shields and use my forward movement to dodge attacks and create space.  

Blocking was as simple as timing, and was omnidirectional. This made fighting mobs of enemies (nekkers, ghouls, drowners, etc) a complete joke, rather than a harrowing experience. As a result, monsters that couldn't be blocked were significantly more difficult. Except...

Rolling and dodging is your 'get out of jail free' button. You're inexplicably invulnerable during a roll, and attacks tend to miss while dodging (even if they go right through you).  

There's no real benefit to alternating your attacks. Quick attacks do significantly higher DPS, and power attacks seem to only exist just so you can have 2 attacks.

Signs recharged much too quickly but were not meaningful enough even if you specced into sign intensity. Yeah eventually you got some pretty scary igni, but yrden and aard were set damage values based on skill level. Also quen was far too strong at any given time.

Bombs also suffered from the fact they did set damage. There were a few skills that buffed them, but they were largely a disappointment.

Oils were implemented in a very disappointing way. I understand they wanted to reduce the tedium of meditating to prepare and apply oils, and they fact you had to know what was coming in advance in order to properly make use of them... but now you have a bottomless bottle of oil that needs to be reapplied mid-combat for no reason. Should either be unlimited or not, because making me open the inventory mid-combat is not good design."
todayilearned,feiw0bq,t1_feglzyb,1579148731.0,"Also: Missing link is a terrible term.

It's fun to illustrate with something common like pencils. 

You put two pencils far apart on a table, one 'missing link'.  
Add a pencil in the middle. Two missing links.  
Add two pencils at the two midpoints of the 'missing links'. Four missing links.

And so on until it's a solid line of pencils which just means dozens of missing links.

Bonus points if you can do it with a pack of colored pencils and ask different people to point to, say, orange and record the different answers as a way to illustrate the ""fuzziness"" of an evolutionary tree, that it's not an ape giving birth to a human, but an ape with a slightly larger parietal cortex."

The only resource that became difficult to control was sleep, and that's just because you couldn't keep drinking cola forever.

It did rebalance the drugs though, which was nice, but it just wasn't enough to justify the additional headache.

A game like Zomboid handles food/water/sleep very well, for instance. The biggest limit is your more realistic carrying capacity means you can't take 3 weeks of food and water, 3 guns, and enough ammo to take down the Institute twice."
