For that matter, knowing who to hire and fire and valuing their input is in and of itself a rare and valuable skill.

And contrary to your assertion that anyone could have seen that private spaceflight would be big business, SpaceX was seen as an enormously risky venture. Private spaceflight struggled to get funding. None of the spaceflight companies founded by people much wealthier than Musk was at the time have been anywhere near as successful. For that matter, reusability itself was written off by most of the sector until SpaceX had already landed and reused several boosters.

When you don't allocate sufficient funding, you're going to experience delays, as Charlie Borden warned Congress in 2015. NASA also changed requirements throughout the program, adding additional expense and delays. SLS, on the other hand, has gotten more and more funding despite the prime contractor failing to meet deadlines. SLS starved Commercial Crew of funds with predictable results.

Commercial Crew has already flown twice with one partial but substantial failure (by the same contractor that hasn't delivered SLS).
