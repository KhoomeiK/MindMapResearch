YouShouldKnow,fet6t2d,t1_fenpbjc,1579372301.0,"I had 230 mb but when I tried to open the files through the browser they all said ""file not found."" I don't ever log into google though and I turn off all the tracking I can. I never use my gmail account and don't have any other accounts linked to it aside from youtube, but I rarely log into that.

Edit - it was only 34 MB! And another zip that was 410 kb. Nice try, Google."

financialindependence,fdy6o7z,t3_end0o4,1578776630.0,"A few years back my friend's boyfriend mocked me for ""working"" after he bought crypto with his credit cards. He went on and on about FIRE and how he was retired at 26 and I would work until I died, penniless in the streets. The market crashed, he's currently unemployed, used all his crypto to make the payment on his $60k truck and is now saddled with credit card debt from his hilarious adventure in ""retirement."" 

Not quite the same as what you referenced, but he did get kicked out of his lux apartment, lost the truck and now lives with his girlfriend who pays all the bills with her grocery store job. ""Retired."""

CasualConversation,fd04513,t1_fd01nbi,1578113352.0,"""Secularist"" here. My response to OP was not filling them with hopelessness. Maybe take your own advice and read up on the subject of existentialism before proselytizing."
CasualConversation,fd015jw,t1_fczzbjt,1578112082.0,"No problem. I've personally found lots of solace in existentialism. I had an incredibly difficult year and toward the end of the whole disaster-after-disaster thing happening to me, I just learned to laugh at the absolute absurdity of it all. There was no point in me looking for meaning behind all these shitty things happening to me. I wasn't being tested. I wasn't a bad person in a past life. Karma wasn't out to get me. The bad things happened because the nature of the universe is entropy - constantly hurtling through space and time toward chaos. Nietzche said "" He who climbs upon the highest mountains laughs at all tragedies."" So instead of getting kicked down by our hardships, let's toast to those who would try and stop us."
CasualConversation,fczz2qk,t3_ejr0x5,1578111106.0,"Maybe you're just reading into it wrong. As Camus said, ""This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."" Or in the immortal words of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, ""Sometimes you just have to bow to the absurd.""

Also, if you feel like you're missing religion, read some Kierkegaard. He was one of the first existentialists and wasn't critical of the idea of god, just institutional religion. I  love existentialism. There's so much more to it than angst and despair."
