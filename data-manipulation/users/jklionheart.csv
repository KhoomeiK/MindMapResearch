I’m in the middle of dealing with when I need to say goodbye to my cat too, and I feel the same about our bond (he was a backyard stray and our trust grew as we slowly bonded). I don’t know what to say to help but it sounds like he was yours and you were his and that bond and love will always be there. Sending you and all of those who loved your kitty lots of love and hugs."
