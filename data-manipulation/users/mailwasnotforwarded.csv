trashy,ffzoqc6,t3_evxmvs,1580388275.0,"If only a presidential elect made this one of their points. To require child support to actually go to the child and not let the parents abuse the funds. Wonder if anyone has thought of a way to just build a company that creates bank accounts for the children who are in the child support system. They will take over the duties of monitoring spending and getting reports from both parents and the child. Then report to the courts with the data saying the parent that was legally required to pay has been making the appropriate payments and the parent who is managing the funds has been spending it correctly. I feel like as long as the company exists it would benefit both parties because I have heard way too many stories of abuse of funds and everything.

The company could use AI to automatically track receipts for purchases to determine what groceries were for the child and which for the parent. (This way alcohol, cigarettes, and items that a child would not need would not be counted.)

Give incentives to the parents to purchasing at ""partnered stores"" where the company partners with them to get them the best price for items like school supplies. 

Obviously a 13yo child does not need a $1000 cellphone but purchases exceeding certain amounts can be flagged and both parents will be notified along with the child and they can dispute the spending to say it is in violation of their agreement."

But I would have been happy to get this kind of memory or experience regardless of the reaction or emotions because it is a learning experience. I think that even if the father were to snap that experience would have been a funny thing to look back at as a story in the future. 

On another note, I feel like the father should have taught him the basics in a parking lot first. It seemed like he didn't understand the pedals and how much to turn the steering wheel. I am guessing he assumed real driving was like how he experienced in video games and that is where his mistake happened because he kept the wheel turned and didnt adjust with where he was going."
relationship_advice,ff6tbs2,t3_ertsws,1579634455.0,Your boyfriend seems to have a very homophobic mentality associated with it. He probably had some experience as a child which is associated with boxers as being a masculine thing. You can try explaining to them that girls have boxers as well and even underwear called boy shorts. If clothes are really a turn off for him then start wearing like granny panties or super ugly women's underwear that are just as loose and comfortable. Does he do the same if you wear his shirts? You can tell him you feel more comfortable knowing you have something of his on when you sleep.

Tank  assume they are a damage role and will charge in without their team or they will not even lead the team into a fight and play with the fear of dying.

apexlegends,fehuo2g,t3_eow89v,1579124218.0,"My suggestion for crypto was to have his drone be controlled by pinging. It is lame how he has to enter drone mode. What if you can send his drone to locations based on locations he pings. If the stone gets out of range he loses video signal. Have him drone have a small video display in the corner or something showing tagged targets. As for his EMP it is a bit broken and stupid in large fights but at the same time it is easy to stop. I suggest instead of having EMP make it so his drone can stealth. This allows his ultimate to be similar to bloodhounds but gives him the element of surprise targetting.

Bangalore should really have a quick reload passive or something that would make her a viable pick. Since she brags about being a super soldier.

Caustic I think should have the ability to use different traps. Maybe onea that poison and ones that maim senses. For example one that would make someone feel ""drunk"" and causes their screen to wobble. Or ones that causes them to be dead when in the area.

Wraith would be amazing if they had a team save it teleport to teammates. Similar to her lore movie. It would be cool if she could just jump straight to a teammate and throw them into a portal.

Octane would be cool if he doesnt follow gravity. Give him super human abilities when he stims like longer slides and higher jumps. Maybe even give him faster reloads.

Watson would be cool to have a weapon class passive. Let's say she uses energy weapons she has a chance to regenerate shield when hitting someone.

Gibby ultimate is kind of useless as a support ultimate. I feel like it should really be a healing barrage and not a damage. Make it so he can pop a large aoe heal spring that heals teammates and increases med usage by a small percentage."

relationship_advice,feegznn,t3_eoihfs,1579033562.0,"Girls are actually very understanding, it is just guys that have the uneasy feeling that they did something wrong or embarrassing. I remember I met this one girl she pretty and we went on a date for the whole day, later in the day, we decided to hook up and like I couldn't get hard. I felt the nerves getting to me and it was wildly embarrassing but she kept comforting me saying it is okay we don't have to rush it. We ended up falling asleep and we woke up in the middle of the night and went at it because I guess the mood just struck a little late.

Guys think dumb things are embarrassing and assume girls think the same way. Just like when guys assume what girls want in a guy when in actuality you can never assume what a girl's preferences are. I have seen all assortments of pairings and I no longer question why did she choose him or why he chose her."
