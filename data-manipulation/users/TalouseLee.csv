offmychest,ffgw9j9,t3_et7o4i,1579916668.0,"Hope you’re hanging in, OP. Wish strength and compassion for you. 

I too work in the MH field. Specifically, adults who are severely mentally ill. Currently have a young mother (mid 30s) on my caseload who had her 4 year old son removed from the houses from CPS. This was a long time coming but after her 3rd suicide attempt in less than 1 year, medication + treatment non-compliant...it’s clear that she cannot care for him appropriately. 

In most cases of the child(or children) being removed from parental custody..it’s for a good reason. CPS doesn’t get their jollies from taking children away from parents but if it is in the best interest, it’s going to happen. 

When I saw the removal of the above-mentioned woman, I felt relieved even though both mom + son were hysterical. That child no longer has to see his mother give up nor does he have to continue to watch her self-harm or find her when she attempts. Now, he has a chance."

socialwork,ff5zlw8,t3_errn74,1579615253.0,"These kind of situations break my heart. Unfortunately, I also work in mental health, I see it all too often. It is about money and it’s also about the word “acute”; these short term care facilities seem to care about bringing the person back to baseline as quickly as possible, nothing else, then poof— discharge. I see how if there is no push for aftercare from family or community providers, unit staff push person served out without looking at the big picture. 

You’re right to question this and to feel that something is not right.. because it’s not. It’s possible not hospitals work this way but in my experience, seems to be.

My suggestion is always: water, water, water. Start fine tuning your diet if you haven’t already; leafy greens’ Get hormone level checked and a full blood work up just to ensure the essential organs are working properly. 

Good luck!"
