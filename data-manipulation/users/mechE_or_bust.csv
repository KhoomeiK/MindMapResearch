Taking notes on iPad is 100x better than paper and pencil - easy to erase, unlimited work space, no more papers to lose track of, seamless organization, all notes are digital, etc. All my textbooks are digital.

I'm an Apple person (Macbook Pro, iPad and Apple Pencil, iPhone XR, and Apple Watch) because I like how connected all my devices are. I can use my iPad as a second monitor for my MBP, I open any app or page on any device and I can quick open it from any other device, all passwords are saved, I can Airdrop instantly, all photos are on all devices, etc. I use VirtualLab for Windows-only programs like SW or ANSYS. Honestly I feel like it's the best of both worlds and I really enjoy it but obviously you don't need to completely convert lol"

If you want something more, then suck it up and force yourself to learn to adapt, because that's what you need to do in real, adult life to get onto better things. If you don't like your school, fine, but don't transfer just because you feel like you need to be closer to home. Learn to be independent and how to function on your own. 

Like the other comment said, things could change and your hometown may not be so comforting in the future - what will you do then?

I know people in my hometown that are comfortable with their lives, working a minimum wage job, living with their parents, never leaving the state. If you want that, then commit to it now rather than blowing your money on education. If you want something more, then suck it up and force yourself to learn to adapt, because that's what you need to do in real, adult life to get onto better things. If you don't like your school, fine, but don't transfer just because you feel like you need to be closer to home. Learn to be independent and how to function on your own. 

Like the other comment said, things could change and your hometown may not be so comforting in the future - what will you do then? You say you'll be far from home for graduate school - who says you'll change by then and graduate school isn't even a guarantee.  Might as well bite the bullet now while you're young and able to mess up with little consequences."
