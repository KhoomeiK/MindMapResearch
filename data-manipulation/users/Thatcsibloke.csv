1) I picked it because I was working in the states and was returning to the U.K. I needed a job and I had heard about civilian CSI jobs being created, so I thought my skill set would match. I guess it did.

2) the affects are different depending on your robustness. Once you are training and you go to your first post mortems you’ll realise that dead people aren’t a big deal, it’s how they got there. Death won’t affect you but the horror and tragedy that lead to it are the things that you might dwell on. I dealt with loads of deaths but I still think of the ones where there was sadness: the lonely old man dying alone; the old lady who planned her death and made sure her son in law found her (he was a policeman ... good call); the murder of the daughter of a guy I knew. That cut me to the core. The minibus load of kids run over on a motorway. 

True horror, in my view, is identifying with the dead. They are often just like you and me. Get help.

You have to remember that YOU couldn’t stop all those murders and suicides. It’s not your fault and you can do nothing to stop them, but you CAN do a good job to catch the killer and see him jailed. You can bring dignity for those who suffered and were broken by the actions of themselves or others. It’s rather oddly rewarding to pick up the child that’s died and talk to him, it makes you remember that you are both human. You won’t know if other people treated him with respect, and he’ll get little at his post mortem, but YOU know that you did a good thing. I had to move a dead boy, nobody else wanted to. I chatted to him and told him what I was doing. I told him his parents loved him (they were both dead too). That was tough, but I did it to cope.

3) My career was stable but I had a run of dead babies (12 years and no baby corpses, the occasional sudden infant death, but they had gone to hospital). In two years I got about 8, and then my wife gave birth. I also missed 4 Christmases, so I quit and now do similar stuff.

4) my advice is to wait till you are in your twenties, but get a job in a police force to get a feel for what the job holds, if you can."

forensics,ff7dsmf,t3_eparkq,1579647231.0,"It’s a tricky area because of the ethics surrounding using human flesh for training. Basically; it’s not often allowed. The dogs I know are trained on meat. So the answer is yes; confusion can occur.

Opinion on cadaver dogs is divided but they can be surprisingly accurate. In tests the dogs in Hamburg were found to be around 95% accurate in positive and negative finds in a lab setting. It was carefully controlled to ensure there was no contamination from previously dead people. They identified carpet tiles that were placed next to a body for a few minutes.

You need to remember that finding a hunk of flesh or bone is not the end of the case; DNA tests and anthropological analysis would still be required. Like all tools, you need a back up test and would never rely upon them or their “opinion” to solve a case. Anybody who does is a certifiable twat.

RBI,fdia0tm,t3_ekqzps,1578438430.0,"I am sorry you have been through this but, I have to say, the rampant speculation in here is astonishing and it’s alarming that people feel so free to provide bogus commentary and inexpert conclusions over what sounds like a routine burglary. I am on an iPad so I cannot pick out your points one at a time so I am working from memory. Apologies.

First off; most burglaries take a few minutes, are poorly planned and are executed by desperate people, not clever, thoughtful, criminals with sharp minds. Most burglars follow a routine and avoid areas of little perceived value like bathrooms and kitchens. The best stuff to steal is in the front room / family room / lounge and bedrooms.

1) It is unlikely they were “watching” your home and knew you were out. It’s possible they saw you leave and decided to have a go. Most burglars do not watch houses or plan who to steal from, they are generally incapable of doing this. All they have to do is see a house that looks like a good target and knock on the door. You say yourself that there is a high hedge (?) and that people go past your premises. Your place looked like a suitable target, end of. Concealed doors and bright spot lights shining in your neighbours’ eyes are perfect.

2) They kicked in the door glass because it was convenient, not because they knew what was behind it. It’s a house (or whatever) so it’s a “legitimate” target. Did the police take a glass sample? Did they examine the glass for footwear marks?

3) They searched through your panties because of the unswerving fact that enormous numbers of people (not all) keep valuables in their panty drawers. They might know this, believe it, or have experience of it. They nearly always tip stuff out onto the bed or floor. It’s unlikely they stole any. They were not impressed, fazed or bothered by your adult toys.

4) They didn’t steal small electronics because they don’t want them. Not every burglar wants your iPad and only an idiot would suggest otherwise. Decent burglars only steal what they can dispose of, which means they need to convert it to cash (normally) or keep it for themselves (enjoyment). What is stolen is C.R.A.V.ED. but burglars don’t always do what we think they would do. Your offender may be known to police so he can only really steal cash if he was going to head downtown and, maybe get stop checked. He doesn’t want to be caught with an iPad or whatever. This is not rocket science. He may not have the slightest clue how to sell a stolen device. Avoid listening to idiots who say it’s easy; it’s not so simple. He has to decide between getting caught doing it and the potential for gain, and if he is stupid he probably imagines he can be caught easily.

5) Are you from the Indian sub continent? When a burglar enters the house and thinks you are Asian then there is a strong possibility that they will carry out a violent and extensive search for wedding jewellery because, as we all “know”, Indians have loads of 24 carat gold wedding jewellery. If so; your burglar may be from your community.

5) They unscrewed the security lights(?) to prevent people seeing them, I presume. This is not uncommon, but it is odd to unscrew all of them as it wastes a lot of time.

6) Planting cameras is extremely unusual but show due diligence and check.

7) Stealing data is also unusual, but consider your banking security and maybe check for devices attached to your pc. Are you a special target like a government worker or something? Do you have shares, special files, critical data from work?


I forget the rest but do note two weird things; most burglars do not return because you are now prepared and have invested in security. There are plenty of other targets. Balance this against the fact that your house was targeted because it was suitable. This means, if you did nothing to improve security, it’s still a good and attractive target to another burglar. I had a regular client; she was burgled every six months (but refused to improve security). New security is good stuff, it’s called target hardening. Consider replacing your hedge with something spiked and evil.

Very rarely; burglars return a few months later (some say; after your insurance payout).

The police officer that advised you to get a dog should have explained why. Dogs generally do not really offer much security, in fact, most Labradors will happily show burglars where the jewellery is hidden.  However; a vocal dog (behind net curtains so he cannot be seen wagging his tail) is a useful first defence and deterrent, but so is talk radio left on during the day, and a TV at night. I have investigated dozens of burglaries with “savage” and “trained” dogs living in houses and they have been useless every single time. People think it’s cute and brave because their dog barks at the doorbell, or gets all excited when he hears footsteps outside and is boisterous with visitors but, when the chips are down, a swift kick in the face, or hammer over the dogs head, does the job. You’ll just end up with a dead or injured dog, a broken heart, and a vet bill. If you want a pet dog; great. If you want a pet to actively guard your house; invest in an alarm system. If you want a well-trained attack dog or guard dog then consider your priorities. Is it worth it? 

I know people will now chip in with one-off stories about what they heard once from Becky’s aunt’s neighbour’s post man, but the exception proves the rule.

Consider extending security to your grandparents’ home.

That’s all I can think of for now. I have had a hellish day and am a little drunk from G and T but I think I know my stuff; 14 years as a CSI, in charge of forensic stuff for crimes like this, 12 years teaching this, and I write training books on forensic stuff and consult.

You have been shaken to the core, your confidence shot, and you feel like you are being watched. I am so sorry this happened but you will be okay and you’ll sleep again when you start to feel confident and secure. You may be entitled to support from a local group, maybe your police force can put you in touch with someone?

Please note that most of what I say is couched with words like potentially and probably. Nothing is certain, ever. But trust me on the dog.

Edit: it’s trees and a fence? Plant vicious spikey bushes beneath the fence. If they are spindly then they will need many, many 2 foot long thin stakes to support them in your new, deep, border. Careful though; if somebody jumped your fence they might land on one and get injured ... have you ever seen someone speared by 2 feet of bamboo? Make sure you don’t plant them there to actively catch bad guys though, because you might fall foul of the law. You need to support those spindly, weak plants ..."

At first I was thinking he was covered in gasoline / petrol because you can very clearly see him and his hair ignite and the flames then spread around him as he shakes his arm downward. I was going to call this out as maybe being lighter fluid, but then the guy on the right erupts, as does the top right corner of the shop. If you scrub this video slowly with a finger you can watch the movement of the fire and see the fireball spread out from him. I think a critical part is where guy number two’s hair also erupts, maybe because the (natural) gas is caught in it: hair traps gas and vapours.

I once investigated a natural gas explosion where an old lady was ejected through where her wall was, a hundredth (or whatever) of a second earlier. She was thrown into the garden. She was fine. Theoretically, if you have to be in a gas explosion, you stand a pretty good chance of survival if you are at the epicentre because there’s limited shrapnel. And flying doors. I choose not to experiment though."

I have investigated a number of deaths caused by kicks to the head and neck, normally when one or both parties are drunk. This is potentially Grievous Bodily Harm and could have ended up as a murder or manslaughter."
