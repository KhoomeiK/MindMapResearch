politics,ffhruy7,t1_ffg5z7o,1579950642.0,For about 30% of Republicans that tweet proves that Trump loves them and the media is lying.
worldnews,ffhrobj,t1_ffhpq7x,1579950357.0,"This is right. While the infected number is probably much higher than what we know right now, the death toll is likely more accurate - meaning the mortality rate is likely much lower than currently thought. Nearly every fatality has been someone over 60, which is sad but not as scary as young healthy people unable to recover."
worldnews,ffhrhr5,t1_ffhnw69,1579950074.0,"It's closer to 3% that we can tell, it's not 50% mortality"
worldnews,ffhek3j,t1_ffhdp0b,1579932004.0,"I'm seeing 1.5-2.5, also Measles is like 30.0 so it's not like the R value is inherently huge or dangerous. I don't like the 3% mortality rate though."

AskMen,ffhe59r,t1_ffhc9r6,1579931562.0,Season 6 was a good comeback.

I used a wood pla for the windmill blades and they came out great, so excited to show this to my players, they're going to arrive at The Bonegrinder on Monday!"
AskMen,ffh18f3,t1_fffjdrz,1579920392.0,I don't think it's worth watching after S2E1
AskMen,ffh16oo,t1_ffgceg9,1579920356.0,5 was rough (but Hardhome is great) but I legit loved season 6

AskMen,ffh1052,t1_ffgwva7,1579920216.0,Winds of Winter S6E10 is my favorite GoT episode
AskMen,ffh0yf1,t1_ffgn2fc,1579920180.0,Season 6 is much better than season 5.
AskMen,ffh0x2e,t1_fffhomp,1579920150.0,"First three episodes of season 8 are fine, in fact I think S8E2 is one of the best GoT episodes."
AskMen,ffh0und,t1_fffgdw9,1579920098.0,"If you do finally get hooked, the first 4 seasons are perfect. 

Then watch S5E1, then S5E8. 

Then you can watch all of Season 6. 

Then S7E1, S7E4, S7E6

Then S8E1-S8E3

Then stop."
AskMen,ffh0lmf,t1_ffg5p7j,1579919906.0,Someone told me to only watch the first season and pretend they never made more. Great decision! It wraps up nicely and I love Heroes.
AskMen,ffh0i0l,t1_ffg82s2,1579919830.0,I liked the show until it became a family drama.

twilightimperium,ffgjrfh,t1_ffgi1xo,1579907838.0,"I somewhat agree. But also, I dont like that they can't adapt to getting screwed on objectives. Also, I don't think they're top tier, just that they're viable with enough luck. 

I still propose making them a scary military forced by giving them the inverse of the JolNar ability. When they use the Secondary of Warfare, they can also use the Primary for free. This has made the Norr a really fun faction to play with and against in my games."

movies,fffi5b4,t1_ffffrk5,1579884475.0,"I would recommend that you don't. I love Death Note, Dafoe and Stanfield, but Netflix's DN is *so* bad that none of that is worth it."

movies,fffhjv1,t1_fffg3l2,1579884104.0,"To be clear to anyone who hasn't seen the movie - the scene is *supposed* to make you feel that way. Not everyone wants to feel that deeply uncomfortable and that's fine, but it's worth noting that it was the intention of the scene."

twilightimperium,fff7ur5,t1_fff7gx2,1579877904.0,"If the other players simply let them set up shop on MR and don't know the game well enough to block Imperial or to take their Home System, then the Winnu are the easiest race to win with. Early on, Winnu win a lot of games until folks realize that it's the only thing they can do, and they're so pathetically weak that they're easy to just punch around in the 2nd or 3rd round and they'll never recover.   


They are the easiest race for an advanced player to stomp on, and there's nothing in their kit that can save them. This is why they are the worst. N'orr are VP challenged because of Tech but they can at least hold their own in a fight and can always hope they get lucky and no/few tech objectives are pulled."

twilightimperium,fff6k3t,t1_fff497d,1579876993.0,"Winnu are a decent race if you're playing against a bunch of folks who have less than 5 games under their belt, and they're much better with 3-4 players than 5-6 players.

Many of us play 6 player games against experienced players where Winnu are probably the worst, even worse than N'orr, so it's just weird to consider situations where they could be good - smaller player counts against inexperienced players."

twilightimperium,fff4qps,t1_fff47gy,1579875658.0,"It's more projection. I absolutely do that to other players, and it's the only defense I can think of. I also work hard to get the promise of protection promissory notes from my neighbors. If I can have 3 full turns of aggression from a neighbor before they can actually get to me, then I can completely leave my boarders undefended and focus all my energies in one direction. Being able to consolidate without worrying about my flanks means I can usually win one or two key battles, which is often all you need to win the game."

JOE BIDEN, 23 JANUARY 2018: And that is I’m desperately concerned about the backsliding on the part of Kiev in terms of corruption. They made—I mean, I’ll give you one concrete example. I was—not I, but it just happened to be that was the assignment I got. I got all the good ones. And so I got Ukraine. And I remember going over, convincing our team, our leaders to—convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.  


So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him.  


(Laughter.)  


I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.  


Well, there’s still—so they made some genuine substantial changes institutionally and with people. But one of the three institutions, there’s now some backsliding."
