adhdwomen,ffatvoz,t1_ff8w7ax,1579744374.0,How did you find a coach?
adhdwomen,ff96y3p,t3_cqs8zt,1579706287.0,Thank you for this. I don’t have a diagnosis yet but am off the charts on everything I read or any online checklists I look at. It looks so helpful and your video was awesome.
birding,ff5wbyj,t3_errpcg,1579612436.0,What a gorgeous little bird. Can’t wait to see one of these

camping,fexxix5,t3_equ9zj,1579437951.0,I don’t know if you noticed but there’s a dude up on the rocks watching you. Even looks all friendly like smiling for the picture but I’m onto him.
TwoXChromosomes,fextvrt,t3_eqphay,1579436143.0,Anti choice. Call it what it is. It has nothing to do with life.
londonontario,fetqfos,t1_fepayr9,1579378384.0,I don’t know if I’ve seen a less educated opinion on teaching. They are paid for 10 months of the year so summers are unpaid. Their pay happens to be spread out over 12 months (wasn’t always this way). Why are they not allowed to earn a professional salary for a professional career that requires education? Why are firefighters allowed to ask for an inflation increase but another profession is not allowed to ask for that without being shit on? Just some things for you to think about but I’m guessing you’ve already thought about them all and made up your mind. And by that I mean you made up your mind and then thought of all the evidence to support that.
BasicBulletJournals,femmzy1,t3_epzehn,1579263179.0,I bought cheap composition notebooks from the dollar store for my morning pages. I use them as a coMplete mental dump that I do not ever read again so these notebooks are easily burnt.
londonontario,fejr8dd,t1_fejp4bn,1579183837.0,Truth be told I’ve never seen an owl. They are high on my lifer list and I try to catch a Snowy every year but haven’t yet.
londonontario,fejnwru,t3_ep4deh,1579181152.0,Good for you! I mean this in the most sincerely way possible. Don’t be afraid to try a few until you find the one that works for you and with you. Not all therapists are created equal. Check your benefits to see if you are also covered for psychotherapy as it opens your options. Many benefits only cover psychologist or MSW.

sneakerhead,fe25m95,t3_enn934,1578834728.0,"Have you tried hydrogen peroxide? Obvi dilute and do some research so it doesn’t ruin the fabric, but it might be an option."
bulletjournal,fdzxau9,t3_eneejs,1578798055.0,Nice!  I plan about 3 months in advance and do the same thing with blank pages.
leaves,fdvwfrp,t1_fdg88g7,1578752425.0,Just downloaded the audiobook for Never Enough. Thank you for the recommendation.
freelanceWriters,fdqjhu2,t1_fdqitan,1578668187.0,I have a similar process. I look at the original as a very rough first draft or mental framework and then bang it out from there.
leaves,fdqdij3,t3_emob9c,1578663793.0,That’s amazing. Congrats!
CampingandHiking,fdk3flf,t3_elthky,1578495113.0,What are you supposed to do? Asking in case my life ever finds me in this situation and I randomly remember a reddit fact.
londonontario,fdf5awb,t1_fdf0gtn,1578353642.0,"This. Every picture shows curds and what they gave me was a pile of crap. Sure it was tasty. And fries with shredded cheese is ok I guess if that’s your thing. But it is not, was not, in ANY way poutine."
airpods,fde00eq,t3_ekvk8k,1578328072.0,Just wanted to add that I love your ring too.
airpods,fddzyxn,t3_ekvk8k,1578328045.0,Was lusting after these at the Apple store. Do they fit smoothly? They look gorgeous.

AskReddit,fd2lfzz,t1_fczppy8,1578148895.0,My kid and I skip everywhere. We get weird looks from people and when he asks why I just tell him to have compassion for those that don’t find skipping the best thing ever.
londonontario,fcqkdo9,t1_fcqbawa,1577887540.0,I have never not had burnt coffee there. Save yourself.
bulletjournal,fcqe5u8,t3_eih956,1577884204.0,Stunning. I am so in awe of this and your ability to do it.
