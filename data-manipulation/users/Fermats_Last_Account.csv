The Bible says good and bad things happen to both good and bad people. You atheists ALWAYS use the “If God ExiSteD why is TherE SuFFeRing” argument; it exists because that is the way the earth is. Many evil things are done by other humans.

The Revelation of John even explains that whatever bad things are happening on earth will happen anyway in order for scripture to be fulfilled. God will end all suffering when he comes back. Jesus explains many times that you should not focus too much on this earth, but of your eternal future.

AskReddit,ffxd71m,t1_fftfpl0,1580322741.0,"See the main problem with atheists giving this argument is that you give him attributes you think God should have and then judge God against that.

The Bible literally says good and bad things happen to both good and bad people. A lot of the suffering you mentioned is caused by other people. Or bad things happen because it can.

Even then, the fact that these bad things happen just support the Revelation of John of the things to happen when you know time is near of his return. As Jesus said, he will come like a thief in the night without you knowing. So you should always be prepared.
