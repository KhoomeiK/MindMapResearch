Hopefully, you've been using [The Slight Edge](https://www.masculinedevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-slight-edge-1.jpg) to your advantage during that time between 30-50.

If you've been a bum until 50, your chances of switching mindset gears, eliminating bad habits, and succeeding are almost 0.

Truth is, you'd better start early (before 30) and hold on 'til the bitter end (60-???) if you really want to maximize the chances of success.

We don't help anyone if we all just say ""yeah, I've been there...sucks, doesn't it?""
BTW, I've been debilitatingly anxious and motivationally anxious (within the past few months) and it's important to keep an eye on that ""motivation"" when you feel overwhelmed.

I know my comment would be triggering. I have a lot of compassion for anyone going through something. 

I merely wanted to show another angle.

If I had a point, it was this:

Most people thinking about stigma are just imagining stigma.

I understand this a hard pill to swallow as I'm messing with people's realities here.

Yes, parents can stigmatize and parents can fuck you up everyday.

Yes, if you're in high school, it can be brutal to admit you are suffering.

But, where else is the stigma? I'm actually curious. If someone has real life experiences of being stigmatized, please share.

People see what they want to see.

Mental illness is more accepted now more than ever. People write books about their mental breakdowns. Influencers have millions of followers while they talk about their depression. Pop idols cancel concerts because of social anxiety and fans have compassion. There are more resources now more than ever. More ways to connect to your tribe. Etc.

Genuinely, I'm asking everyone and myself...where is the stigma?

Not everyone. Maybe not the majority. Maybe a small percentage.

But, c'mon, most people say they suffer from depression yet do a dozen things on a daily basis which cause that depression.

Stigma is never good. Of course, not.

Maybe there is a lot of stigma right now. But, perhaps people feel stigma when they know on a deeper level they are not an innocent victim in this mental health illness and the judgement they feel is from themselves about being their own prison guard.

One enormously productive thing I've been trying to instill in myself is the belief that people either don't care about you or they love you.

I try not to create this illusion of someone expecting something of me. MOST people you think are judging you are worried they are not good enough. MOST people are just as fucked up as you think you are.

""People""...?

Mainstream society actually really loves ""fucked up"" people, all the way from Donald Trump and his narcissistic mania to Heath Ledger's madness. (Just two random examples...)

I just urge you not to make enemies out of an illusion.

It's bad enough to have a mental illness. Don't make it worse by imagining the world thinks you're an asshole for having it.

It HAS gotten a lot better to be a person with mental illness, as much as we might think there's stigma.

""I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one cheerful face on the earth.

Let me offer something...how do you think it feels to get tons of attention on your Reddit post?

It's surprisingly meaningless.

Getting a post upvoted by thousands on Reddit does very little to heal your depression.

It's an amazing community but you're foolish if you think you're going to come on the a subreddit and improve by more than a couple percent.

Get off the Internet. Be in someone's vicinity. Look at someone in the eye if you can bear it. Touch someone. Get real help. Breathe oxygen. Find the truth. Unplug and LISTEN to why you're depressed. 99 times out of 100, there's a very obvious reason you're hiding from.

Most posts on here are by lazy people who want a cheap, easy way to validate themselves. Now, some of the posts are genuine. But, a lot of people (I guarantee) post this gigantic plea for help and look at all the upvotes and genuine comments and time spent on them and shrug it off. People don't realize the time and effort it takes to write something to a stranger on the internet.

They say, *""Mehhh, I still feel the same...no one helped me...""*

**My advice:**

Do the real work. 

Wanna be depressed? Hang out with depressed people. Let it be normal. Let the thoughts of thousands circulate in your head until they are your own. 

Wanna be undepressed? Get out of the echo chamber where these voices knock around.

I'm only on this subreddit to spread this message anyway. Pretty sure I'll be banned soon because I'm encouraging people to quit it with this cheap posts seeking easy fixes."

Instead of arguing WHY it matters, why don't you prove to yourself that it doesn't matter.

MuayThai,fdzwhio,t1_fdzdikc,1578797474.0,"A) Most fighters who train can go many rounds in training but suddenly don't have ""any cardio"" when the fight starts. This is mostly a mental/nerves things. If you're not spending a lot of time mentally preparing for your fight, you're going to hurt your cardio due to an adrenal dump. Later, you'll wonder why your cardio was so bad. ""Shucks, I shoulda done more 5km slow runs..."" No, learn to lower this stress response through visualizations, sports meditations, seeing a sports psychologist, progressive desensitization, etc. Anyone who is a top performer has this stuff down. You don't get very good at anything until you are doing this kinda stuff.

B) Assuming your mind is right, here are ten workouts I'd do to prepare for a 5 x 3 minute round fight (that are more effective than a 5km jog)

1. Tabata for four minutes on the heavy bag (all out like you are going for the kill) X 5, two minute break in between rounds
2. Tabata for four minutes on the mitts (all out like you are going for the kill) X 5, two minute break in between rounds
3. Interval running (Fartlek) for no more than 20 minutes where at least 75% of the time is 80-90% pace
4. Sprint 4 x 800 meters as fast as you can
5. AirDyne for ten minutes (burn 300 calories on the monitor or you've failed the workout)
6. Tabata for four minutes on the AirDyne (all fucking out) X 3, two minute break in between rounds
7. Row a sub 8:00 2000 meter on the Concept2 Rower
8. Row for 15 minutes at 30 seconds all out, 30 second easy pace
9. Any kind of high intensity circuit training involving plyometrics, weights, bodyweight stuff like Gym Jones or (can't believe I'm saying this) Crossfit...so long as it doesn't require weightlifting technique and you stick to exercises that match ""fighting"" motions.
10. Combine any of these with pad work, bag work, sparring. Blast yourself on the other forms of cardio and then get in the right and do padwork when you are already at 0%. That's where the mental stuff synergizes with the physical stuff.

""What is this a catalyst for?"" is the question I'm trying to keep in mind as I undergo the darkest phase of my life (that I have a sneaking suspicion is a serious fuckin' spiritual awakening).

I definitely don't think most people are ready for these experiences. You don't go do ayahuasca and then go back to Sunday night football, voting in a two party system, watching the next season of the Bachelor, or so many of the things that just appear as offensively ridiculous once the veil is sliced through.

(Nothing against those things in particular, just examples of things you'd see after an awakening as silly.)

It's crazy to me how so many truly stripped away authentic people are ostracized by society and yet some of those same people like Russell Brand or Eckhart Tolle are exalted.

Thank god for the Internet. Imagine being awakened only to go back to your sleepy little village in the 1700s."
Nootropics,fdh5o7z,t1_fdgsj6b,1578415919.0,"While I agree with you mostly, the whole personal choice thing is a hard pill to swallow. Yes, I think DP and DR is a spiritual awakening but I also believe it comes with some serious neurotransmitter fuckery. I believe it's a deeply chemical and physiological thing morese than an ""experience"".

I recognize the link between your choice to have a disorder and having a disorder. Just go to r/depression and you can see a lot of people who clearly are choosing their depression and live on that subreddit for easy validation. (you post a plea for help and 400 people upvote you and tell you it's going to be okay.)

Meditation is wading into the waters of dissolving your entire reality. Having an experience that triggers DP or DR is being pushed into the pool at a pool party when you're wearing clothes.

Also...telling someone to use their brain (the VERY thing that is broken when you have DP, DR, Depression, etc.) to power through into a crazy paradigm shift instead of wallowing in pain is incredibly hard to do.

Hence, 47,000 Americans killed themselves last year and that number is only going to rise."
Nootropics,fdgpmoa,t1_fdgldyf,1578404971.0,"Yes, DP & DR makes you feel like you're in a terrible dream. Your loved ones lose their importance. You feel like your world is about three feet surrounding you and there's nothing beyond it. Like a video game character who cannot see beyond his bubble. You don't trust your own brain. While I do think it's possible you can somehow transform DP and DR into a transformational experience, it takes a long time.  


I had it in 2015. It didn't go away until I moved to an big Asian city and I was able to convince myself that ""sure, you're in a dream but isn't this a cool dream?""  


Meditation: Our consciousness is everything!  
DP / DR: Pretty sure my consciousness is the ONLY thing and everything I perceive is not actually there :/"

Weird advice.

Assume everyone likes you. Assume everyone wants to be your friend. Assume everyone, given the right circumstance, wants to ""seal the deal"" with you. However you want to define that. Business, relationship, great conversation, mentoring you, letting you in the club, etc.
