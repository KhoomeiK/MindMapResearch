The story:

I'm looking at buying a laptop. I haven't been able to find the particular model I want anywhere near me for physical purchase. But it's available on Amazon. Cool.

We've had a problem with some porch thefts at my house. I've started to get my Amazon purchases shipped to a Amazon Hub Locker 2-3 blocks from my house. I've had many things delivered there, including: $100 headphones, some sneakers, a Kindle, a doggie DNA test, some boots, bedsheets, and a router. Point is, I've had a myriad of items successfully shipped to an Amazon Locker.

When I go to purchase the laptop and set my delivery address as the Amazon Hub Locker, though, I get a message that says ""This item requires special handling and cannot be shipped to your selected location.""

But if I change the delivery address to my home (again, only 2-3 blocks away from the locker), the laptop is suddenly available for Prime delivery.

Anyone have any idea what's going on? A laptop seems precisely the type of purchase that you'd want sent to a secure location and not be left on your front porch."
