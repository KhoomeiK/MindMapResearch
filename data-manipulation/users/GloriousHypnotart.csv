Perhaps you should have thought of that and got a better paying job or had the foresight to be born somewhere else?"
AskReddit,fg6q9rs,t1_fg6o9gl,1580574406.0,"Seriously. The UK has spent three years behaving like chimpanzees towards the EU, complete with the ridiculous flag waving the other night. I know people who have left this country because of the hate they've been subjected to, and I for one cannot wait to go either. There's only so much shit one can bear to have slung at them. If this is how Britons treat their friends, I do not wish to see how they treat their enemies."

The evening truly is the best time to spend in the towns, and daytime is for eating gelato half dead in the shade. It didn't take long to adjust to the new schedule because it does feel more natural in that climate whereas at home I eat at midday and 6pm, otherwise I get hangry"
