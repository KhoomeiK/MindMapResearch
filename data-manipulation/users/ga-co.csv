TheRightCantMeme,ffnakaa,t3_eu775k,1580063733.0,Why are they so fixated on speaking fees? Do those automatically make the message untrue?

Showerthoughts,ffd3v7j,t3_esv8kl,1579812904.0,You're not accounting for the wear and tear you're putting on that bike that presumably isn't cheap. Maybe the gym should keep all of the electricity you generate while you wear out their bike.
MMA,ffaoqgu,t3_esh6gl,1579740934.0,"If he wants to say Maycee was in no condition to fight, fine... he should have had the corner throw in the towel. He didn't... and I can only assume that didn't help the extent of her injury."
MMA,ffaohrn,t3_esh6gl,1579740771.0,Disrespecting the nicest fighter in the game isn't exactly a smart PR move.
PublicFreakout,ff8d87n,t1_ff7h5n4,1579673666.0,Much less just casually let someone put their hands on it.
sports,ff89m4p,t3_es2g6r,1579670078.0,Someone get this man some help. He likely still has a lot of money and could live a comfortable life if he just isn't allowed to self-destruct first.
todayilearned,ff430nn,t1_ff42yni,1579554437.0,No clue. It seems dumb to me.
todayilearned,ff41zie,t1_ff41xu3,1579553801.0,Runners pushing strollers. I guess sometimes you can't get away from your kids.
todayilearned,ff3ocg4,t3_erem32,1579545355.0,"While running a 5k, the regular runners were given a 15 minute lead on the stroller division. I finished my 5k under 23 minutes so I was fine, but my manager said he nearly got passed by a woman pushing a stroller."

UpliftingNews,ff2hgbs,t3_er5poe,1579506299.0,"Meanwhile in America we have people who are ""sticking it to the libs"" by buying plastic straws. Good to see China (at least on this one topic) is moving in the right direction."

RepublicanValues,ff1x0lq,t3_er57wo,1579488115.0,"But you can't indict a sitting president? So let me get this straight... if he commits an actual felony that's on the books, nothing happens... and if he abuses his power in some way that runs counter to what we expect of a president, nothing happens. Am I getting this right?"
oddlysatisfying,ff1vf4m,t3_er4cdk,1579487051.0,Sorry. That Atari is a 1986 model. Not sure what you were waiting for those first 9 years.
TheRightCantMeme,ff0r5qg,t3_er0df3,1579471518.0,We’re not sure he is a billionaire and a lot more people are laughing at Trump than will ever laugh at me.
nottheonion,ff0p9bw,t3_eqy5c6,1579470959.0,Good luck with that. Boomers and their crappy politics have young people broke AF.
science,few4ok6,t3_eqjmaw,1579405313.0,"This amount would just apply to couples who are able to conceive naturally. Once IV comes into the picture, the numbers get a lot worse. To this childless male, it would seem that having a child is a terrible, terrible financial decision in America."

worldpolitics,few3rwk,t1_few3op1,1579404935.0,No. Now please point to anything that I said that is untrue.
worldpolitics,few3e44,t1_few1tlp,1579404782.0,I prefer a sane president who resorts to drone strikes over an insane president who resorts to drone strikes. Does that make me a bad person? Anyways... it was Obama who pushed for the development of drones that don't kill whole groups of people. The weapon that took out that guy from Iran a couple of weeks ago was a result of Obama's push. What sort of things has Trump pushed for to make the world a less deadly place?
MMA,few18by,t3_eqqu4f,1579404015.0,Worst possible night for Maycee. She lost the fight so that's a setback in the rankings. She likely suffered an injury that will take time to heal. Even worse... she lost the shit out of that first round and might lose a little bit of that confidence as a result.
worldpolitics,feubpb8,t1_feu5gxl,1579385019.0,"Yes, yes he did."
worldpolitics,fetmtys,t1_fesnv9d,1579376981.0,Nice whataboutism. Trump is crazy. That was the point.
TheRightCantMeme,fetmhno,t3_eqgcjo,1579376857.0,Those people know different stuff. Toss my white butt out in the African bush and I'd be dead by sunset. We're all different and that's not a bad thing.

MMA,fepivcm,t3_eq8msk,1579321639.0,Earlier someone said $5 mil and $2 mil. Maybe those were taking into account PPV points?

RepublicanValues,fel7fz4,t3_epk889,1579215688.0,"Considering that some separated children are being sexually abused, it's possible the elephant isn't barking up the wrong tree.

The complaints go back prior to the Trump administration, but spiked after the child separation policy was enforced.

TheRightCantMeme,fek2u2k,t3_epitju,1579191422.0,Let's not laugh too much at this. Those two oldest kids almost certainly have presidential aspirations.
