depression,fdt0itf,t1_fdszcyr,1578710345.0,"I’ve been more open about my feelings here on reddit on one of my like 3 reddit posts than I ever was with my multiple therapists, and I have no idea who you are where your from or how old you are.

depression,fdsyc7y,t1_fdsxd3c,1578709535.0,"I just had to live knowing I made somebody laugh idk why or what I got from it but seeing that I made someone smile just always made me feel like a slightly less shittier person. And I know that wherever I end up after this I’ll continue to do the same thing over and over again, because I never fucking learn.

Also how about Chernobyl’s glow sticks?"
depression,fdswqkb,t1_fdsvxp0,1578708937.0,"And I just keep burying it aswell. When I was still at school I’d hide all the shit and I’d try way to hard to make other people happy and laugh, it was the main reason I was always in trouble. And even though i did my best to make everyone smile, they never really appreciated the effort I went into thinking of jokes for my “friends” the night before that might be sad or creepy or desperate or whatever but it’s what I did and I now realise I never really meant anything to anyone. I just kinda existed in people’s lives you know :( .

And it has nothing to do with Russia but I’m grasping at straws: Nixon’s bookkeeper?"
depression,fdsvid9,t1_fdsu9go,1578708480.0,"I don’t know how long I’ve had depression for but I always remember feeling sadder than everyone else you know never really wanted to do much but whenever I did try to do things with friends no one ever wanted to go out or nothing so I just stopped trying and it’s gotten worse and worse.

Also he isn’t a soviet leader but he’s Russian: rasputins pathologist?"
depression,fdstiiz,t1_fdssqh1,1578707741.0,"People say you’ve just gotta keep on pushing through, but the thing is I’ve pushed for so long and look where I am I just don’t see a point anymore you know?
