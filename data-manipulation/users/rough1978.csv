politics,ffnxlcq,t1_ffnwa13,1580072056.0,"You automatically bring up guns. No jumping sharks, but you and I both know where you were about to go. Don't get all sensitive because your game is predictable and used up. We should make a law about bringing lame shit to the table, but you wouldn't abide by it."
politics,ffnvqal,t1_ffntgse,1580071452.0,"And as far as your anti-gun views... you do know that the highest rates for gun related crimes occur where the most idiotic gun laws are ""enforced"". Imagine that, criminals using guns, don't abide buy gun laws. Who knew? Ohhhh that's right, people with common sense. Making laws for criminals. Lol. Head. Out. Of. Ass. Google that too, don't turn a blind eye again when you see facts that don't correlate with your bull shit. Have a nice day."
politics,ffnu343,t1_ffnrx8v,1580070836.0,"Common sense. Obviously a foreign language. Allow drug dealers to roam free and this is the result. You're witnessing your ""progress"". You love it, right. Progress."
politics,ffnslxk,t1_ffnrwev,1580070238.0,And it has nothing to do with allowing drug dealers to have a safe haven right. Common sense. Try it.
politics,ffnpd68,t1_ffnkofk,1580068921.0,"Progress... that's a subjective term. When you make a city a sanctuary city purely for political reasons, I'm sure you consider that progress. Meanwhile there's a heroin epidemic in San Francisco directly related to being a haven for criminals. Going back to before the time of sanctuary cities is progress to anyone with even an inkling of common sense."
politics,ffkum0q,t1_ffjgjtq,1580029184.0,"I grew up a minority in a small farming town in California's San Joaquin valley. I was treated like shit for the majority of my childhood. I have no biases. I have no hate for any race. I only hate seeing people make everything about race. Until these bigots change their ways things aren't going to get better. Don't start your comments with ""I'm a (insert race and gender here)"" because it doesn't matter. If you have something substantial to say then just say it without pulling your numerous cards. Yes this country is full of racists, but guess what... the majority aren't white. (Gasp). White people this, white people that. Just own up to the fact that someone else isn't the root of the problem and take a deeper look at yourself. Have that ""Oh shit"" moment."

Y'all kill me with this oversensitive ""he hurt my pussy"" bullshit. Trump can say good morning and y'all are gonna claim it was aggressive and hurt your feelings. We're ALL tired of you fuckers whining about losing the election. Even the not extreme leftist antifa Democrats are sick of y'all fucking up their party. Get real. For the sake of democracy get real."
politics,ffj6k4y,t1_ffiudi7,1579991665.0,You just sound like you have hate for white people. Maybe try not being racist for one single minute and you'll see. Open your eyes. Democrats only pander to minorities for votes. Do you think Hillary and Bernie actually care about anything but your vote? Ocasio is a pawn. Quit making everything about race and shit will get better. The Democrats are the only ones bringing up race and that says a lot
politics,ffj5hy0,t1_ffi6a5a,1579990908.0,Don't forget about how Obama robbed from the VA to fund Obamacare. At least trump has returned funding back to the vets. He's trying to help y'all. Taking funds back from obamadoesntcare. I hate how it's all twisted but he has done good things for the vets.

I make a decent living. 28 bucks an hour. Rule of thumb is rent should be a third of what you make in a month. 3600 a month bring home. 1200 a month will get you a studio or a mom in laws quarters here. Gavin Newsome and Nancy Pelosi live in mansions while they're ""serving the public"" just sucks that they're serving us a heaping helping of taxes with a side of get ready for more.

Moved back to California 12 years later and this place has become such a nanny state that it's not even funny. What is funny, you think new Orleans is the best part of Louisiana, that city is a cesspool, but being from the bay area I can see why you think it's nice. As soon as I make enough to release this states economic grip on me I'm leaving like so many others have wised up and done. Won't miss California a bit."

Hell, Hillary and Bernie were best friends last election now she's basically calling him a piece of shit. Please open your eyes people for the sake of us. Socialism is not a good thing. Look at Russia, look at every country that has tried to make socialism work. They're all no longer countries. Greece almost destroyed Europe with socialism.

The majority of the quote from ""The Jerk"" which makes it even better :
