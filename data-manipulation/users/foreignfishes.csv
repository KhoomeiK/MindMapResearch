news,ffvkqg4,t1_ffvgeba,1580266413.0,"I agree with the general sentiment that the problem goes far beyond the existence of for-profit prisons, but I think it’s somewhat disingenuous to say “only 8.2% of prisoners are held in for-profit faculties, that’s nothing compared to the rest of the prison population” without mentioning that fact that privatization is rampant in publicly funded prisons as well. Basically every single service in corrections that can be outsourced has been in the past few decades; probably the only one that hasn’t been is actually executing people. Telephones, email, video visitation, food services, medical, janitorial staff, commissary, even the fucking library someone is finding a way to make money off a captive audience in publicly owned prisons and jails. It’s a symptom rather than a cause but still it’s pretty insidious."

climbing,ffscxzc,t1_ffrc3l0,1580178724.0,"So I’m usually a little bitch about sleeping on the ground because I’m bony and sleep on my side, but I slept on [this thing](https://gearjunkie.com/exped-megamat-10-lxw-review) on a wood floor at a friend’s cabin last year and it was super comfortable, I honestly felt like I was sleeping on an actual mattress. Not the world’s best actual mattress, but it’s thick and way better than any other camping pad I’ve slept on. It is big though, you’d definitely have to check measurements. 

Another option that might be worth looking into is the really cheap basic foam mattresses that Ikea sells. They have two that are for kids or daybed/futon type arrangements so they’re like half the thickness of a regular mattress. The absolute cheapest one is basically a mattress topper so I wouldn’t recommend, but the next one up is [this one](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/meistervik-foam-mattress-firm-white-50315875/) and seems like it could be decent. They also have a guarantee (can’t remember if it’s 90 days or 1 year) on mattresses so you could return it if it was uncomfortable."

blogsnark,ffs1ewp,t1_ffrgap4,1580170789.0,"I'll definitely admit to googling around for examples/""scripts"" when I need to send an email I don't know how to approach (mostly emails related to job searching/hiring, which I feel like is a process with a lot of unspoken norms that people don't actually agree on?), but I always chalked that up to being young and having relatively little experience in the professional world sending professional emails so I tend to overthink the ""important"" ones. But tbh email is different than talking because you can take time to write one without being weird or stilted...I can't imagine anyone reciting a pre-planned script to a coworker in real life without it being very odd.

climbing,ffrmyo3,t1_ffqlkwm,1580161387.0,"Another vote for just using a FB group. People are much less likely to participate if there's a barrier to using it like downloading a new app/making a new account, and while FB isn't 100% ideal it's something a lot of people already have an account for and know how to use. If your gym ever makes Facebook event pages for things they put on there's also the added bonus that it integrates easily with groups and whatever existing social media they have."
climbing,ffr5wwi,t1_ffr0jit,1580151151.0,"I’m also interested in the answer from someone who knows more about this but something that comes to mind is that your rope and your harness are two pieces of gear that being to you and can be inspected by you personally prior to use. Obviously that doesn’t prevent some sort of catastrophic failure (in theory, in practice I don’t think there are any cases of a perfectly fine looking rope just breaking out of nowhere), but it does provide an additional safeguard that’s usually not available for anchors or bolts. Most of us climb on bolts we didn’t personally set and rappel or lower off anchors that we don’t know the history of. 

Also one of the big arguments in favor of assisted braking belay devices over tube style ones is that the ability of the device to arrest or slow a fall provides a backup to the belayer’s hand."

todayilearned,ffmt7s8,t1_ffmlffa,1580058657.0,"That’s what happened at my previous job too. I worked for a large bank that you’d think would be conservative and slow to get with trends like working from home but they started making a huge telecommuting push when they realized that they could save on real estate costs and fit more people into one office while also making employees happy. 

Honestly it actually worked out pretty well, if you worked in the office all the time or had one day a week at home you got your own cube, and if you worked from home 2-4 days a week you picked from one of the unassigned desks. Hot desking was originally intended to be used for places where most employees are in and out of the office all the time and not everyone is there at once (like with sales teams where they travel a lot and aren’t in the office much), doing it with your whole team and making them come in every day just seems miserable."

climbing,fffl4p7,t1_fffdndy,1579886314.0,"At a lot of gyms they double wrap the TR anchors which adds a lot more friction in the system. With that setup you're not going to get pulled off the ground even if the climber is twice your weight. If the rope just runs up over the anchor and back down it's much easier to get lifted off the ground. You can brace your feet against the wall, find a sandbag/something to clip yourself to, or kind of sit in your harness when you feel yourself starting to get pulled off the ground."
