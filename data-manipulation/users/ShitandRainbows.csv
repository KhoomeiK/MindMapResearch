Disneyland,ffnj9cs,t1_ffng54k,1580066660.0,"I was evacuated twice yesterday as well. Sounds like the same area as you were. I finally did get to go on it ~11. It was a fantastic experience. I feel like I missed so much of it though because I was trying to see EVERYTHING, and in trying to do so I know I missed whatever was going on where I wasn’t looking. Keep trying if you live at all close to DL. I got there just around 5am, and into the park at 7:20. I was doing speed tests all around the park and was getting 120mps, but at 7:58 it it dropped to just over 1mps. The app was glitching on me saying,”Uh oh, Something went wrong” while people all around me were cheering that they got theirs. It was really stressing me out. Reloaded the app and got boarding group 87. 
Good luck!

Edit: what on earth about my comment would deserve a downvote?"

I have more expensive knives, but I really like this gyuto. It is *absolutely* rough around the edges. Mainly the spine, but with a little bit of rounding with some sandpaper, it’s very comfortable. The edge out of the box was fantastic, did an amazing job of shaving my forearm.  Have been using it since, at home not work, and it’s been holding up pretty nicely. 
Hope your mom enjoys and takes care of it.

Edit: it’s late and I thought this was a gyuto, not a pairing.   I bought the gyuto. Regardless, Tojiro makes a pretty damn good product."
