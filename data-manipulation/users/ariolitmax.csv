The_Mueller,ff8hq9g,t1_ff8g9d4,1579679015.0,"I don't have any professional experience with cults, I've read a few things here and there. I mention that just to be clear I'm throwing an idea out there and not trying to speak authoritatively. 

But I think it's difficult to empathise in part just because of how differently they see and understand the world. There are accounts of people raised in a cult, trying to cut ties, and then discovering that people outside of the cult don't even seem to speak the same language as them. Their cult had essentially developed its own dialect, with vocabulary revolving around its own core concepts. This created an isolating effect. People would feel overwhelmed and confused, and ultimately return to the cult because it was they only place where they could understand and be understood.

I don't think the American political divide has reached such an extreme, but the basic foundation is there. We have an unprecedented ability to ""unsubscribe"" from anything we disagree with. This creates a feedback loop where, virtually without regard for what our beliefs may be, we can present ourselves only with information that emboldens who we already are. 

I suspect that this collective filtering of ideas is beginning to manifest itself as a linguistic barrier almost as much as an ideological one. Conversations can only reach a certain point if, for example, the *word* ""socialism"" represents, to different people, both an optimistic goal as well as an existential threat to their way of life."

It really puts into perspective just how little people think about this stuff. The president aggressively withheld evidence to the point where an entire article of impeachment is about doing exactly that. The man is on tape multiple times committing that exact removable offense. 

Not to mention this same person also believes that the results of the impeachment (the president was impeached) meant that he was proven innocent, because he was still in office the following day. 

Yes, this person literally believes that lies are truth, and that impeachment is innocence. If Trump is removed from office, I would hardly be surprised if people started calling it a promotion"

Tinder,ff3tp2f,t1_ff3l93a,1579548631.0,"It do be like that

It's a tough reality for musicians who want to ""make it big"" with their own songs and their own band. It's crazy unlikely that that's going to happen without sacrificing something. 

A career musician will take gigs playing covers at weddings, bars, schools, musicals, whatever. Thus 90% of their time is spent not playing their own stuff. 

The alternative is having a completely different career with which to fund their music. Of course, this also means 90% of their time is spent not playing their own stuff, or even music at all.

Option 1 is the best just because of the hours you put into your instrument & the people you meet. But if you only want to make your own stuff and not rely on it to pay the bills, having a random other career can actually be a much better option. You won't be as good or have as many opportunities, but since music isn't your job you can take your instrumental progressive death metal in any direction you want without second guessing yourself"

But at the same time, it's so devastating for the person who reaches that point. We grow up so eager to get our license, to finally have that independence and control over our own lives. We reach so many important milestones, like buying our first car. We form so many lasting memories, like going on our first road trip, or packing up everything we own and moving somewhere new. 

I myself have a ton of precious memories of my late grandfather, who drove me to school every day when I was very young.

And then, after having that agency over your own life for as long as you remember, you wake up one day and it's all taken from you. You're stuck at home again, you can't just go to the store whenever you want, you have to burden others to do anything. And you realize that your age is catching up to you, and you start to wonder what will be taken from you next.

I found out years later that my grandfather could barely see, and just memorized all of the signs between our home and my school. He probably shouldn't have been driving at all, but it was his way of doing something important for me and for his family. Yearly testing is absolutely a good thing, just for everyone else's safety.

I like talkorigins a lot, it's a great resource. They address virtually every one of the anti-science tidbits on rotation at creationist churches. With citations, too.

It does always come down to epistemology though, and like you said, there's a certain amount of responsibility you need to exercise to apply it fairly and honestly. Creationists are motivated by things other than honesty, which unavoidably makes them come off as dishonest.

Whereas from their perspective of course, secular people are motivated by things other than faith, which unavoidably makes them come off as agents of Satan.

Don't think so. If they're saying the world is only a few thousand years old, they need to prove that. And they can't, because it's fictional. So they don't try, and instead try to relax and place the burden on others to prove them wrong.  Kind of like what you're doing"

People spend years in University just to learn about one area of science, and many more years are required to teach it. So the shotgun method of trying to just dismantle as many fields of science as possible is going to eventually make them feel like they've proven their point, since nobody is going to be an expert on every subject. 

The real solution, which they really don't like because it illustrates their bullshit, is not to let them steer the conversation in that direction at all. They're making a point, ""God created the universe last Wednesday"", or whatever. Now they have to prove it. They aren't correct by default until science proves them wrong, science has nothing to do with it as a matter of fact. 

Because no matter how educated you are, there's always going to be a point where you don't know something. The difference between a creationist and an intelligent person (whether they are religious or not), is that an intelligent person stops when they reach ""I don't know"", and maybe even tries to figure it out. 

The creationist leaps from ""I don't know"" to ""...so God did it!"". Listen carefully for the moment it happens if you ever suffer the terrible condition of speaking with one of these people. I guarantee that no matter what you say, they're gonna loop around to ""God is the only explanation""

Astronomy

""if we were one inch closer to the sun we'd all burn up"", ""Earth has an elliptical orbit that varies by ~25 million miles throughout the year"" 

Biology

""Nobody has ever been able to turn a zebra into a giraffe, or a frog into a lion, or a monkey into a man"" , ""The processes of speciation occurs gradually, without a goal in mind, has been demonstrated in animals & insects with short lifespans, and has irrefutable corroborating evidence present in both genetics and the fossil record""

""Carbon dating is not accurate beyond 50,000 years"" , ""radiometric dating is accurate for well over a billion years""

Ethics 

""If it weren't for faith, people would just rape and murder each other because nothing was stopping them"", ""Sounds like a you problem tbh""

People can be casually brutal about genetic factors which are out of people's control. Like being constantly bombarded with images and comments regarding the ideal breasts/weight/height/length/whatever the case may be. Of course being exposed to that is going to make you question your own worth.

If you watch any one of the public hearings in full (long, but worth it), what you'll see is a group of Democrats asking questions to witnesses. You'll see witnesses responding to those questions. 

You'll also see Republicans doing this uncanny valley screaming match. Picture this, it's their turn to ask the witnesses questions. You know, the entire point of the hearings? Instead, they completely ignore the witnesses and use their full time to give a deranged, gaslighting speech directed at nobody in particular. Full of literal lies, Biden misdirections, and disparagements directed at the Democrats.

It's absolutely surreal. At one point, during one of these rants, the witness just interrupted and said, ""Do you have a question for me or...?""

At another point, the Republican asked the witness a rhetorical question by mistake. The witness tried to answer it, and what followed was a 4 minute argument about whether the witness should be allowed to answer the question. The Republican argued that allowing the witness to speak would be taking away from ""His time"". 

It makes you wonder...""Why? Why are they being so weird?"". Until you realize, their strategy is 100% to just create highlight reels for Fox. Sure enough, in the days after, conservative media is plastered with nothing but clips of those bizarre, apropos-of-nothing word salads, and all of your conservative coworkers are just repeating what they heard and becoming even more entrenched in their beliefs. 

It's left us in this scary place where the people who actually watched the hearings are 100% positive Trump should be impeached, and the people who trust their sources and spent an hour or two listening to Republicans vent are 100% positive the Democrats are assholes and the impeachment is a sham. It shuts down any avenue of discussion because it's just *so clear* to everyone, depending on whether they saw it with their own eyes or believe the lies they were told.

The Republicans were absolutely demolished in the hearings, but that doesn't matter to their base because they just keep *saying* the opposite is true. And for their base, this actually nullifies the truth, because now it's a matter of ""they're saying one thing, I'm hearing a different thing, so I guess there's no way to know for sure and I have to just go with my gut"""

But I think it's difficult to empathise in part just because of how differently they see and understand the world. There are accounts of people raised in a cult, trying to cut ties, and then discovering that people outside of the cult don't even seem to speak the same language as them. Their cult had essentially developed its own dialect, with vocabulary revolving around its own core concepts. This created an isolating effect. People would feel overwhelmed and confused, and ultimately return to the cult because it was they only place where they could understand and be understood.

I don't think the American political divide has reached such an extreme, but the basic foundation is there. We have an unprecedented ability to ""unsubscribe"" from anything we disagree with. This creates a feedback loop where, virtually without regard for what our beliefs may be, we can present ourselves only with information that emboldens who we already are. 

I suspect that this collective filtering of ideas is beginning to manifest itself as a linguistic barrier almost as much as an ideological one.

It's a tough reality for musicians who want to ""make it big"" with their own songs and their own band. It's crazy unlikely that that's going to happen without sacrificing something. 

A career musician will take gigs playing covers at weddings, bars, schools, musicals, whatever. Thus 90% of their time is spent not playing their own stuff. 

The alternative is having a completely different career with which to fund their music. Of course, this also means 90% of their time is spent not playing their own stuff, or even music at all.

Option 1 is the best just because of the hours you put into your instrument & the people you meet. But if you only want to make your own stuff and not rely on it to pay the bills, having a random other career can actually be a much better option.

And then, after having that agency over your own life for as long as you remember, you wake up one day and it's all taken from you. You're stuck at home again, you can't just go to the store whenever you want, you have to burden others to do anything. And you realize that your age is catching up to you, and you start to wonder what will be taken from you next.

I found out years later that my grandfather could barely see, and just memorized all of the signs between our home and my school. He probably shouldn't have been driving at all, but it was his way of doing something important for me and for his family. Yearly testing is absolutely a good thing, just for everyone else's safety.

It does always come down to epistemology though, and like you said, there's a certain amount of responsibility you need to exercise to apply it fairly and honestly. Creationists are motivated by things other than honesty, which unavoidably makes them come off as dishonest.

Whereas from their perspective of course, secular people are motivated by things other than faith, which unavoidably makes them come off as agents of Satan.

People spend years in University just to learn about one area of science, and many more years are required to teach it.

They aren't correct by default until science proves them wrong, science has nothing to do with it as a matter of fact. 

Because no matter how educated you are, there's always going to be a point where you don't know something. The difference between a creationist and an intelligent person (whether they are religious or not), is that an intelligent person stops when they reach ""I don't know"", and maybe even tries to figure it out. 

The creationist leaps from ""I don't know"" to ""...so God did it!"". Listen carefully for the moment it happens if you ever suffer the terrible condition of speaking with one of these people. I guarantee that no matter what you say, they're gonna loop around to ""God is the only explanation""

Ethics 

""If it weren't for faith, people would just rape and murder each other because nothing was stopping them"", ""Sounds like a you problem tbh""

MurderedByWords,fdjv8pt,t1_fdjrmgx,1578488621.0,"People do talk about small breast syndrome. I think it's said as ""tiny titty committee"" more frequently. I agree a lot with the feedback loop described in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/elpdy3/promptly_blocked_after_this/fdjrwnn) in this thread

People can be casually brutal about genetic factors which are out of people's control. Like being constantly bombarded with images and comments regarding the ideal breasts/weight/height/length/whatever the case may be. Of course being exposed to that is going to make you question your own worth.

And then people turn around and demand confidence and self acceptance from those being thrown under the bus, or they risk not only having their physical ""flaw"", but deserving it because of their bad personality. Like we see in the OP, the dude has a bad personality so now it's okay to dig into him about his height. I'm not sure how we as a whole can really move past these things, but the whole vibe is really hurtful, and not always just for the person being targeted. 

As an aside, small breasts are actually awesome! You get the same number of nerves compacted into a smaller space so they're really sensitive and super fun. The same is actually true for penises but society isn't ready to talk about that yet."

politics,fdgv82j,t1_fdgqy9u,1578409156.0,"Dude the hearings were absolutely insane 

If you watch any one of the public hearings in full (long, but worth it), what you'll see is a group of Democrats asking questions to witnesses. You'll see witnesses responding to those questions. 

You'll also see Republicans doing this uncanny valley screaming match. Picture this, it's their turn to ask the witnesses questions. You know, the entire point of the hearings? Instead, they completely ignore the witnesses and use their full time to give a deranged, gaslighting speech directed at nobody in particular. Full of literal lies, Biden misdirections, and disparagements directed at the Democrats.

It's absolutely surreal. At one point, during one of these rants, the witness just interrupted and said, ""Do you have a question for me or...?""

At another point, the Republican asked the witness a rhetorical question by mistake. The witness tried to answer it, and what followed was a 4 minute argument about whether the witness should be allowed to answer the question. The Republican argued that allowing the witness to speak would be taking away from ""His time"". 

It makes you wonder...""Why? Why are they being so weird?"". Until you realize, their strategy is 100% to just create highlight reels for Fox. Sure enough, in the days after, conservative media is plastered with nothing but clips of those bizarre, apropos-of-nothing word salads, and all of your conservative coworkers are just repeating what they heard and becoming even more entrenched in their beliefs. 

It's left us in this scary place where the people who actually watched the hearings are 100% positive Trump should be impeached, and the people who trust their sources and spent an hour or two listening to Republicans vent are 100% positive the Democrats are assholes and the impeachment is a sham. It shuts down any avenue of discussion because it's just *so clear* to everyone, depending on whether they saw it with their own eyes or believe the lies they were told.

The Republicans were absolutely demolished in the hearings, but that doesn't matter to their base because they just keep *saying* the opposite is true. And for their base, this actually nullifies the truth, because now it's a matter of ""they're saying one thing, I'm hearing a different thing, so I guess there's no way to know for sure and I have to just go with my gut"""

You should consider fucking off like that cop up there. 

Once, an officer stopped me for no reason when I was 2 hours away from home. Thank God everything about my car was on the books, the dude spent ten minutes looking me up and even searched through the shit in my car. Eventually he lies about how fast I was driving and I had to go to court. 

Of course the date was a month away, and I had to travel back the 2 hours to the courthouse nearest to where he pulled me over. As someone who had to drive for work, the anxiety that month was through the roof. I also wasn't made of money, and had to not only miss work that day but spring for a 4 hour round trip. All for a 10 minute meeting where the guy just hand waves the whole thing away.

For years after that I would get a small anxiety attack any time I saw police lights behind me, knowing that my livelihood could be threatened by some asshole in a uniform having a bad day. 

This is not an uncommon sentiment. This woman, contrary to what you're imagining, looks like she's about to start crying when she realizes she isn't about to become a victim. There are very real risks when dealing with the police, most people are vibrantly aware of those risks, and especially with what's been going on lately it isn't unreasonable at all for someone getting pulled over to fear for their very life. 

Oh but ""y'all don't realize how good you have it and you just like being outraged over nothing"". Your stupidity is about as nuanced as your take on this situation."

That's why I wish her first story in the earlier scene was done in a way that Steve could have realistically misunderstood her, rather than in a way that was essentially him drawing the only conclusion he could have. 

It's been a minute since I've watched, but if I recall she pretty much just said ""I was obsessed with you"" without indicating that she was obsessed in a roundabout way because he was flirting with her crush. So I think it created a lot of dissonance later when she finally revealed that piece of information"

But I think the scene earlier on where she was strongly hinting at past feelings conflicts with the scene where she >!comes out!< and redirects their relationship. 

I kind of accepted it because they were in an altered state of mind, but I felt like the way she phrased her whole story underground was unambiguous. I would have liked to have seen a more realistic misunderstanding causing Steve to jump the gun, or more focus on Robin clarifying that the drugs kind of made her translate the story poorly"

Lighting, texture, audio signals, information on the HUD, differentiating the background & foreground in 2D titles. All things that might easily be missed if someone is just watching or doesn't have a lot of experience. 

It runs even deeper with that in terms of game-specific knowledge. My 22 year old friend who had never played Zelda before was stuck for almost an hour very early on because he didn't realize he had to pick up a stick, light it on fire, and then use it to light a torch on fire to unlock a door.

When you think about it, it makes no logical sense at all. ""I need to get this door open"", ""oh of course, I have to light these torches"". But that's just how Zelda is and it's the kind of speed bump experienced Nintendo fans just don't run into"

It also helps to have something to show people. Post something online, put some contact info on there. Maybe burn a few CDs and give them out, mention to people that you're available for booking. 

Go to concerts and venues that are playing stuff similar to what you do. Ask how you can perform. Be polite, be humble, be enthusiastic. The worst thing that could happen is they say no.

Check out open mic nights, or even look into organizing an event yourself. Depending on where you are and what your laws are, just take your equipment outside and start playing in a park or near the street. Put a bucket out for tips, have contact info ready that links to your online stuff or contact info. 

Find other musicians. Post on Craigslist or whatever, ""I do x, I've done y, I'm looking to do z"". See what happens.

Be safe. But for the most part, just throw yourself out there. The worst thing that could happen is for nothing to happen"
