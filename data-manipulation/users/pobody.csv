TeslaLounge,ffekedm,t3_et6ngi,1579851701.0,"My only regret was not getting the P. At the time it would have been +$15k to add everything and I couldn't justify it. But after riding in a friend's P and then when it dropped to $10k I was sorry I didn't order it.

The extreme example obviously is cancer. But mutation is happening all the time. Most times it's ignored as redundant copies override it, but not every time."

The second reason is, what would it do for us? We don't have a compelling reason for cloning other than to see if it can be done.

DNA mutates over your lifetime. You clone a 30 year old man, you don't wind up with a baby. You wind up with a very small 30 year old with a blank brain. So you've doomed them to a short, painful existence."
