nyc,ffiea6i,t1_fficroj,1579971799.0,"I agree. But that’s in large part due to the fact that NYC never had an abandoned city center like most other American cities. Boston and Philadelphia have “historical” centers because they were bombed out slums in the 60s and 70s. And there was nothing else going on. 

We have some of that old history here but it’s scattered about based only on what has survived. It’s actually one of the things I kind of like — go to Five Points and imagining what it must have been like. Or thinking about a wall running down Wall St. The structures are gone but the history is still there and it’s fun to find the clues. I love the Urban Archive app. 

And there are plenty of historical neighborhoods in NYC — LES, Brooklyn Heights, Red Hook. The Seaport is NYC’s Fanieul Hall. It’s just a kitschy tourist attraction. We don’t need to attract tourists! 

By the way I’m glad you mentioned the Dutch history of NYC. Reading “The Island at the Center of the World” was such a monumental revelation in my understanding of the City and of American culture generally — that conflict between the puritanical English and the commercial Dutch still defines why NYC is so different to this day."

There is much worth preserving but NYC is dynamic and ever-changing and that’s something to be proud of. Look at what’s happening in TriBeCa and the High Line. It’s demolishing a lot of “history” but it’s making the area more beautiful. Remember the protesters who objected to cleaning up Times Square in the 1990s? I get it, there was a morbid curiously about the sleaze and porn but can anyone really say that was an asset to the city? Not everything is worth preserving."

The car was fully stopped for quite a while. If the AI initially sensed the trick was there why would it change? Maybe he switched it off by accident and had creep mode on? Maybe the driver was wearing boots and didn’t feel his foot resting on the accelerator? This has happened to me. 
Maybe there was a defect in the software or hardware because it’s a car carrier and the gaps in the structure made the AI think nothing was there. There are lots of potential reasons for this. I just don’t really see what one video clip has to offer."

Even though you may actually agree that saving the whales is a good cause, the way so many activists go about it is so nasty that you just get turned off. So you turn it into a joke. 
That’s the thing about Trumpism — it’s fun to laugh at SJWs. I know people who detest Trump but would love this t shirt because they also detest the seemingly endless attacks on white privilege. I’m sure I will be attacked for manslpaining but why should today be any different?

relationship_advice,feyp9am,t3_eqvfzt,1579448558.0,"Middle aged male here. This is a difficult situation. From a relationship standpoint, sex is an important part of the relationship because there’s it’s the one thing you’re not supposed to do with anybody else. (I can’t comment on open relationships and that seems off topic.) But sex is not the most important part. My fear in this situation is that the sex isn’t just ok, it’s making you unhappy. Eventually, that will bleed into the other, more important parts of your relationship. It is something you need to address. The question is, how?
From a male standpoint, this guy knows he’s terrible in bed. He know he has a small penis. He knows he cums too fast. It must be so stressful for him and I feel sorry for him. Please don’t assume that he can just “fix” his premature ejaculation problem, any more than he can just grow a bigger penis. The problem can be fixed, but it is deeply psychological, and also part physical. He has to learn the physical sensations. But he also needs the confidence to be able to do it with you. It must make him unbelievably insecure. My guess is that the stress of having a small penis puts too much pressure on him and then he can’t perform. A catch 22. What a mess. 
I really don’t know how you can bring this up with him, but I feel like you have to try. Here’s the thing — you can’t make him feel bad. That will only confirm his insecurities and make the problem worse. Somehow, you have to let him know how much you love him and that you want your relationship to be so loving in every way. I would try to think of a way to say that you both get along so well and you’re so in love that you should figure out ways to spend more time making love. You want things to slow down and relax, and to be mutually enjoyable. It sounds like sometimes you’re satisfied and sometimes he is, so explain that you should both be able to please each other. (Even if it’s not entirely true that you’re satisfied, you have to lie a little to bolster him.) If you are really, truly loving and compassionate about it, maybe you can help him learn how to control his orgasm. Look up the stop/start method. Read up. It will take a long time. Many months. And he has to be a full participant. It will be hard and you might need expert help. But what he needs is the encouragement to overcome his insecurities and be fully loving with you. 
It’s possible but extraordinarily difficult. But if you’re really that much in love, then addressing this should strengthen your bond. His mind will be blown that he’s not only got a wonderful girlfriend from the outside but she’s going to help him in the one place where he feels most helpless. If you can help him with that, he will be yours forever, truly. 
As for the small penis thing, I wouldn’t address that unless you can fix the other bedroom stuff first. Short of getting an operation, what can you do? My guess is, if you are able to create a bond in the bedroom, then eventually he will bring up the penis size and ask if it’s a problem. You have to gush with love in response. Tell him how much you love him and how he’s a generous lover and whatever other stuff you can say, and everyone has to learn how to make love to another. Tell him that everyone is unique and what you focus on his how you are in bed together. I agree with some other posters who said bring sex toys and/or anal sex into the relationship might help with all of this. Maybe see if he wants to watch porn together? I’m sure he will run for the hills because he knows the guys will have big penises and he will be ashamed to watch with you. But if you can do this kindly without making him feel badly, I’m telling you this guy will do whatever you want. It’s a slow process and I’d start slowly by just being super encouraging when he does something you like. Maybe even mention it out of the bedroom — “omg I loved it when you did that thing last night”
I don’t know if this is helpful but I guess what I’m saying is that you have to address this. It’s never going to be like that mind blowing former lover. But it can get better if you’re kind a patient, and if your boyfriend responds well. There is a breaking point and only you know what it is. Maybe you’re there and this post was just a last ditch effort. But if you’re willing to give it a shot, compassion for his physical shortcomings (pun intended) is the only way. It’s like being upset at someone in a wheelchair for not being able to dance. Think about how you’d approach that person if dancing were important to you. You can’t change what you can’t change but maybe there’s a way to accept the reality and make accommodations for it. Dance sitting down. Dance using the wheelchair. Get a wheelchair that spins, I don’t know. Make it your special, loving thing that only you two do together and nobody else can do or maybe no one else even knows about it. Make the small penis a great part of your sex life. There’s a way, but the two of you need to find it. 
Best of luck."
