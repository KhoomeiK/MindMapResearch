Doesn't make you ignorant, who has the time, right? It's pretty damning. Yes I know breitbart and fox just kept chanting no collusion. Trump team had over 100 contacts with Russia. His son was meeting with Russia about Hillary's emails, remember they lied and said it was about adopting a baby. Mueller testified that it's was Trump's obstruction of justice and witness tampering that hindered the Mueller team. Furthermore, using the term collusion, didn't make any sense particularly because it's only used in antitrust cases."
PoliticalDiscussion,ff76t2z,t3_eryrw9,1579642254.0,"The Republicans are in a tight spot. Trump got caught once again. First he was working with Russians to help him win the 2016 election, this time he tried exploiting Ukraine. Got caught red handed. Yes the ""transcript"", which was a basic summary, didn't fool any moderates. But they can't impeach because the Republican base doesn't actually care if he committed or is committing crimes and will take it out on any politician who doesn't follow suit. All they can hope is enough moderate/left leaning voters won't like who wins the Democratic primary and in turn doesn't care to vote. This would once again be the far left vs the far right, and Republicans usually win this stand off because 18-29 year olds vote less the 50%. Where as the Republican base votes at a much higher percentage. So the Senate is just going to try and save face and hope Trump doesn't do anything else."
