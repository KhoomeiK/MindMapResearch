CanadaPolitics,ffcwt0w,t1_ffcse6m,1579808909.0,"I agree. Leadership races are one thing, but appeal to Canadian voters is a whole different ball game. Good analysis."
CanadaPolitics,ffclfa7,t1_ffck7x3,1579801953.0,"That is not my argument. I am not suggesting that they are not conservatives because I don't like them. Ideology is a spectrum. I align quite closely with them. But when it comes to politics, a general sense of conservatism should remain. I dont think O'Toole or MacKay are bad, but I think that sticking to the brand is important for unification and crafting a clear, coherent identity."
CanadaPolitics,ffcjpb5,t1_ffcj39l,1579800910.0,"I'm not suggesting it is. But conservatism is an ideology with core principles and of course Canadian conservatism has it's own core ideals, but I think that a party called the Conservatives should be conservative in ideology and governance. I dont think thats ridiculous to expect."
CanadaPolitics,ffcixfx,t1_ffbv34k,1579800444.0,"Not necessarily. I don't mean to be extreme, but parties should stick to their identity. The Conservative party should be Conservative. The Liberal Party should be Liberal."

CanadaPolitics,ffb1u5g,t1_ffb1fa1,1579749680.0,"I think Poilievre could be the leader Scheer couldn't. An Ontario seat with a guy that's part Albertan and Quebecois? Scheer always seemed fake in his attacks because he tried to be Happy Andrew but when push came to shove, his attacks looked out of character and weak. Poilievre has been fiery for years, and I think he will look more genuine."
CanadaPolitics,ffb0g1k,t1_ffazzgt,1579748738.0,"I agree on that front. I think finding a candidate that people beyond the base like is important, and where we went wrong in the past with Scheer. A return to a Harper type wouldn't be that bad, but I think the social issues have gotta go from the mainstream platform. Fiscal policy is the bread and butter."
CanadaPolitics,ffawlkj,t1_ffabmxv,1579746178.0,"I'm just concerned about a shift to the middle causing some identity loss of the conservative brand. If they tories run a watered down liberal, why not just vote liberal? I'm a red Tory myself, but Poilievre seems to be the favourite among Blue tories."
Emo,ff9x57y,t3_esd7r6,1579723427.0,Great video and great album!
CanadaPolitics,ff6oxrh,t3_ertsq3,1579631832.0,I think voting along party lines is nothing new. It's what we expect from out representatives now.
BreakUps,ff3vf2p,t1_ff3uel4,1579549702.0,No worries my friend! I have plenty more up my sleeve. Tomorrow is a new day! (Hug)
BreakUps,ff384ey,t1_ff369n4,1579535940.0,"Breathe! It'll be okay. After awhile, the same reaction you once had disappears. Eventually, they will just become normal parts of your workplace."
BreakUps,ff2toi0,t1_ff2tnda,1579523723.0,Anytime! Best of luck.
