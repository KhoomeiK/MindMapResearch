I would put paintings like 1 and 2 somewhere more private, like a bedroom. As a guest, I generally try to avoid people's bedrooms because I don't belong in there and I believe a bedroom is a person's most sacred environment. Because of this, I think paintings like the first two are more suited for a bedroom. The other paintings though would be fine for anywhere else in the house you can expect a guest to see."

InteriorDesign,ffqeug7,t3_eu2k4r,1580132489.0,"Do the terms of your lease allow the modification of walls in your apartment? Any solution you devise must abide by those terms. 

The only issue with LED strips is they have to be diffused or reflected somehow to cut the harshness of the light itself. This can be done with a small piece of trim or something similar, but how it attaches to the wall really depends on the lease agreement. Most likely you'll have to use adhesive to keep it up. Another challenge will be finding a light strip to be bright enough. Whatever choice you make will likely be better than no light, but light stripping I've only seen used is usually used to replace lamps. 

If it were me, I'd still have a lamp, if not two, and I'd use the brightest LED bulbs I could find.

I fall victim to the same trap sometimes, even in private text conversation, but I always have to cut the business-like concentration of my speech by throwing in a funny/unusual observation or setting up a punchline to a dad joke. In reality I'll never be able to converse on the same level a frat bro will be able to, but I will at least be able to keep a conversation going, even if it is superficial. 

When a conversation dies like you've described, find a question to ask them to keep that going. Make them seem like you're interested in whatever they're doing. But do not turn this into an interrogation. Ask them a question and answer it for yourself. This means you'll have to formulate even 10% of an answer and improvise 90% of the rest of the answer before they have a shot of answering. Or, if they know the answer immediately, that gives you time to formulate your own. You still have to listen to them though, making sure you grab the highlights from what they said. On top of all of this, you'll have to make a conversation interesting and engaging for the person you're talking to, which means lightening up a little bit or even showing a little bit of a smile once in a while. 

A lot of this conversation will be superficial, but at the end of the day you'll find someone you resonate with based on the answers they give or even the style in which they answer it and from then on you'll start to get a bit of a acquaintance or even a friend going."

I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a response that also made you hungry due to low blood sugar.

We should be focused on figuring out the quirks of the personality type and trying to build ourselves around those with strategic planning and optimization, two concepts which should be familiar with all INTPs. I find myself identifying less and less with this subreddit and I score solidly as an INTP. That's not to say I don't understand the struggles of being an INTP, but it's better to improve on the weaknesses in the type instead of accepting and dealing with it. 

Like any other INTP, I'm more than comfortable with sitting at home by myself, but it gets extremely boring to do so, especially when balanced with work. Now that I've left college, I have little chance to socialize with people outside of work and that does a number on you after you get in the habit of working, then going home and playing video games. Eventually you start looking for other stuff to do but it all loses it's appeal eventually where you want to deal with people. 

I get bored really easily and the one thing I've found that is constantly interesting is how different other people are. You'll find some people have really weird life goals or real weird quirks. Sometimes you'll find they have the same quirks as you. Sometimes you'll learn about a new way of thinking. People are really good about bringing about fresh ideas, something that fuels our thinking and discovery processes."

I went from 3600 cal to maintain weight down to 2000 or less, which is a 55% calorie deficit.

Stay the course and eventually poo will be firmer and you'll be able to trust farts more. (I say your gut has no memory because I believe the gut has it's own form of memory depending on the food it's eaten before. Because I've floated in and out of keto before, my gut bacteria should have an idea of how I eat on this diet, meaning that there's less changeover time whenever I switch on and off the keto diet. Newbies will suffer with this until their gut bacteria adjusts accordingly.)

keto,ffc0gkg,t3_esfnlx,1579788363.0,"Yes, it's basically just shirataki noodles. The Konjac root alerted me to this. 

How you'll want to cook it is by rinsing the cold noodles with hot water in a strainer over a sink to get all of the nasty lye water off of it. Afterwards, pan fry in a nonstick pan until all extra water is boiled off of it. Whenever you see no extra boiling or water added to the noodles, they are done cooking. 

Afterwards, you can add anything to them. I've added pasta sauces before including tomato and alfredo sauces with great results. I've also added pesto and I even added pure butter to make butter noodles and the noodles handled those excellently. 

Be aware they have a radically different texture than a normal noodle but they're easy to get used to after learning to cook them correctly."

Drinking just the one glass of water a day with salt is not enough to quench the thirst your body has. 

Your symptoms read like hypovolemia, essentially a low blood volume. This could be caused by a variety of things, but a common one is dehydration. Heart rate starts to climb with me and though I don't follow it super closely, it does fall lower after I drink a lot of water.

A symptom I have with dehydration is that I feel tired and fatigued, even after having both a Monster Energy drink and a coffee. After drinking enough water, I have enough energy that I can actually forego the coffee every morning, which has decreased my dependency on caffeine."

I find myself questioning a lot now whether or not I'm actually enjoying the food I'm eating and I'm more surprised than not at the results. 

I drink coffee with no sugar and with a lot of dairy-free creamer. Since I've been around the block, I basically consider this coffee to have 3-4 net carbs whenever I load it down with creamer. Yesterday I threw my cup out after I didn't get the right amount of creamer in it and it tasted bad. Before I would just drink it and hope for better next time. Same idea with a lot of other food now. If I order a steak and vegetables at a restaurant and either of those isn't great, I don't eat it and I go home and fix up something that is way better.

Do you notice a difference if you have a more lax feeding period on IF as opposed to a stricter period if you've tried it?

Regardless, I'm convinced IF + Keto is the way to go if you need to lose weight. The lbs are currently melting off of me right now and I'm having retention issues with my pants and belt that I didn't have last week. The IF forcing you to go into energy-burning mode for most of your day combined with not being able to meet your caloric maintenance level everyday really melts the fat right off."

Otherwise, consider running more mana rocks or mana dorks with a high defense because you can use those as either mill engines or for mana sources to fuel the Dramatic Isochron engine. Mana dorks are better for that. 

Commenting on Mortivore or Bonehoard, those cards are more conditional than Sewer Nemesis or Consuming Aberration because you may have opponents that don't run a lot of creatures. Just something to consider. 

Because you run Syr Konrad, you could run graveyard hate to make him more potent because his ability also triggers if a creature card leaves the graveyard.

Before this month, Thassa's Oracle wasn't even a problem. As soon as it was released it became a problem. What we can learn from this is all it takes is one or two cards from each expansion to break a format.

If we leave all of these cards in the cardpool and just ban Flash, we'll be looking for another scapegoat to ban whenever the next expansion comes out.
