medlabprofessionals,ffdmdk5,t1_ffd15tf,1579823958.0,Our supplier charges us if we do this. Ridiculous.
medlabprofessionals,ffazaua,t1_ffaxz91,1579747966.0,"No. We are still inspected and regulated by the same organizations other labs are regulated by. 

Here are the requirements from the lowest grade med tech position we have:

medlabprofessionals,ff37oh9,t3_erbkjw,1579535649.0,"It seems like you actually plan on trying to do this, and while I don't want to discourage you from scientific experimentation and hands-on learning, I don't really think this is a financially feasible project. The reagents you will need for this (both to remove/denature antigens and to prove you have done so) are fairly expensive and unless you are just trying to show what's already been discovered and is being used in immunohematology testing, I really don't have any idea where you would start in finding an antigen to try to ""remove"" that hasn't already been manipulated by researchers. Enyzme treatments to denature antigens are not new and like /u/MouthIt said, blood that's undergone these modifications is used for testing, not transfusion.

Perhaps there's another idea you want to consider or we can help you think of something?"
medlabprofessionals,fejoj5i,t1_feifiz7,1579181687.0,"To my knowledge, it can be pooled in the hospital blood bank (i.e. if a doctor would like to transfuse multiple units and the blood bank only stocks singles). The blood bank I work in pooled cryo some time ago. It's much easier of course to stock units that are pre-pooled by a supplier, pooling it on demand just adds extra time to an already short expiration window and a lot of times it's needed fairly quickly anyway.

As far as making cryo in-house, I'm not sure. Theoretically it could be done, the blood bank would need the proper FDA registrations to create products and things like that and not all do, but I don't know if it's done at large facilities or anything. We certainly dont."

todayilearned,fejicm5,t1_fej25c5,1579175551.0,"I had to do some research about when HLA antigens form in embryos (8 weeks or so?), but it seems like it's possible although far less likely. That's really not in my wheelhouse so maybe someone with more direct knowledge can answer that one!"
todayilearned,fei4ofc,t1_feh5f0y,1579130208.0,"Here in America, blood banks can't pay for blood. However, companies can pay people for plasma donation, but those donations don't go directly to patients - they go to pharmaceutical companies, research, manufacturing, etc."
todayilearned,fei3j3h,t1_fei35cu,1579129484.0,"I am not really sure your point here - I mentioned blood suppliers from the beginning which are strictly unpaid donations, I didn't bring up paid donations. I'm well aware of the uses of paid donations, but plasma for transfusion is in demand as well."
todayilearned,fei2rt2,t1_fehz9ww,1579129012.0,"Yes, if it's paid it cannot be directly transfused."
todayilearned,fehzjyg,t1_fehgzr2,1579127060.0,I like to claim I'm a reverse vampire since I give blood away rather than taking it!
todayilearned,fehzi2y,t1_feheqan,1579127028.0,"Does she wear a medical alert bracelet or carry a card or anything? Just curious! I know of patients with antibodies to red blood cell antigens who have received multiple units of blood that were later found to be incompatible with the patient's specimen. It seems the immune response is suppressed when the body undergoes trauma (and I have read some journals about it also). So I would like to think if she was in an accident and needed blood badly enough, there would be no reaction or less of a reaction. The situation isn't exactly the same but the premise is."
todayilearned,fehz1cw,t1_fehn0jk,1579126747.0,"You guys test everyone? That's really nice. I used to work at a blood center but left around the time HLA antibodies were becoming a big concern and suppliers were deferring donors without even testing them, just based on gender and pregnancy history."
todayilearned,fehyswq,t1_fehvwps,1579126607.0,"Plasmapheresis is sometimes used for unpaid donations too, it just depends on the blood center. We get about 50/50 apheresis plasma units and plasma from whole blood at my hospital."
todayilearned,fehyoeu,t1_fehfbva,1579126533.0,"Antibodies from the recipient attach to the donor red blood cells and cause an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. The recipient can experience a lot of different symptoms, including fever, chills, back pain (kidney related), shortness of breath and some have talked about feeling an ""impending sense of doom."" The antibodies attached to the donor cells activate a process that causes those cells to burst (not good) and release their contents, including hemoglobin (which carries oxygen) into the blood stream. The kidneys are usually heavily affected from filtering this junk out, and the patient may have hemoglobin in their urine. The patient can also begin developing small, weak clots in their vasculature (DIC, or disseminated intravascular coagulation), which use up platelets and clotting factors and can cause uncontrollable bleeding.

Giving O+ blood to an O- patient is normally not dangerous. While antibodies to ABO antigens are naturally occurring – we develop them without being exposed to foreign blood – the antibody to the D antigen, which is what makes blood 'positive' or 'negative' (you might hear Rh positive or Rh negative), is not developed until after exposure to a blood transfusion  or pregnancy. Even then, not everyone makes anti-D right away, or ever. In routine transfusions we screen for the presence of unexpected antibodies like anti-D before giving blood, but in emergencies doctors weigh the risk of a patient bleeding to death vs. the small chance of being Rh negative AND having an anti-D already. Since it takes time to develop an antibody like that, we can use O+ blood, which is much more common, until we determine the patient's blood type or until the bleeding crisis is over."
todayilearned,fehvkrh,t1_fehleki,1579124734.0,I don't know if HLA antibodies are a consideration for paid donations. My experience is with unpaid donations that go directly to patients.
todayilearned,fehcft9,t1_fehbrh0,1579113698.0,"Not a big deal! Yeah, for paid plasma the type generally doesn't matter."
todayilearned,fehbc07,t1_fegx2wd,1579113041.0,"You're right that plasma has no blood cells, but it does have naturally occurring antibodies in it (except for AB plasma). So that's why we must give compatible plasma, otherwise those antibodies can harm the recipient."
todayilearned,fehb6ah,t1_fegz86v,1579112944.0,"That must be awful! As someone working in a blood bank, we always hear about giving washed blood products, or IgA deficient products, to patients like your wife, but I've never actually run across that situation in my career."
todayilearned,fehan0m,t1_feha8z3,1579112628.0,"Interesting! Well, AB+ blood is needed too, and it is one of the rarer types. We try to always give patients their type, not just something that is compatible (say A to an AB patient), so that could be their reasoning!

They still get a unit of plasma from your whole blood donation, and potentially a partial dose of platelets. Every supplier has different donor demographics I guess!"
todayilearned,feh9n9j,t1_fegutqv,1579112029.0,"Wow. I work in a blood bank (hospital, not supplier) – that's pretty extreme. I'm sorry that happened."
todayilearned,feh9e4i,t1_fegst61,1579111874.0,We switch to the correct blood type as soon as possible. There is a very limited supply of O negative. In many situations we skip O negative and use O positive – it's acceptable in emergencies for adult males and for women who can no longer have children.
todayilearned,feh8rki,t1_feh2xpg,1579111494.0,"Are you female and have you had children or been pregnant?

Plasma can contain something called HLA antibodies, which are far more common in women who have been pregnant – they are exposed to their baby's foreign antigens and can make these antibodies then. If a unit of plasma or platelets (which generally contain some plasma also) with a high level of these antibodies is transfused, it can cause a potentially fatal reaction called TRALI – transfusion-related acute lung injury.

To help prevent this, some blood suppliers  don't create plasma products from female donors at all, or they test the antibody levels before doing so (which can be expensive and time consuming).

Sorry for the extensive answer – I work in a blood bank and it's part of my job!"

medlabprofessionals,fdr6zqg,t3_ems7wn,1578680320.0,"We used the Bloodtrack Emerge system at the trauma center I worked at.

https://www.haemonetics.com/~/media/sharepoint/software/bloodtrack/marketing/brochure/col-copy-000831_us_bt_emerge_trauma.pdf.ashx?pdfviewer=true

They are required to scan a patient label and we are alerted in the Blood Bank when the refrigerator is opened. Each unit is scanned and assigned to that patient ID. Emergency release forms were required if the units were used.

They can return the units to the fridge and it will track how long they were out and quarantine them in the system if they were removed for too long (IIRC you can set the time). 

I'd advise the use of something like Safe-T-Vue. We also went and checked the fridge after it has been opened and restocked if necessary.

They were not to use these units except for trauma situations, regular ED emergencies required them to pick up emergency release from us."

I can't really devote the time to a full program but I'm qualified to sit for the exam, so hopefully this plus the other review programs available will be enough for me to pass. If not, it's nothing lost – I don't get a raise for it, it's just for personal growth."
medlabprofessionals,fct0d29,t1_fcsqysq,1577929609.0,"First of all I wouldn't agree to work a shift with no scheduled relief. If there's an hour and a half gap between my shift and the next I'm calling management immediately, not waiting until the last minute to try to find someone else to take things over who isn't even trained in the department.

I'm not suggesting anyone work anything besides their scheduled shifts on a regular basis but if my relief is running late or in an accident or something, I know I will need to stay to cover because it's a critical area. This situation that OP describes shouldn't have happened in the first place but I still don't think it would be acceptable to leave the department without coverage."
medlabprofessionals,fcsj722,t3_eiolml,1577917599.0,"Absolutely unacceptable. Family or personal emergencies I could *maybe, potentially* entertain (but not likely approve of), but essentially throwing a tantrum? No way.

todayilearned,fbyw9c1,t1_fbxhea0,1577228043.0,Not true. Whole blood is used by the military and is actually making a comeback and is being used by a lot of trauma centers now as a replacement for ratio-driven protocols where we send out multiple units of different product types.
