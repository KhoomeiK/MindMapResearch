It’s your parents’ job to love and support you, even if you turn out a disappointment. Trust me, I know exactly how it feels to make excuses that your parents don’t want you or that you’re a failure or the kid nobody wants, but none of it is true."
depression,ff3m3po,t3_er2si8,1579543964.0,"Here, I have a method to steer yourself away from those thoughts. I call it the “Angela Method” (not my name). Basically, if you find yourself saying bad things about yourself (ex. It’s all my fault), say something as stupid as possible (ex. It’s not my fault, it’s Dwight Shrute’s fault!) it’s a fun way to distract yourself from those thoughts.

Hope this helps :)"
depression,ff2ioeb,t3_era3gf,1579507848.0,"Well, I would take the “Angela Solution”

Whenever you start telling yourself negative things (Ex. I’m stupid), divert yourself with the funniest comeback to yourself you can think of (Ex. I’m not stupid, Jazz is stupid)

Obviously it isn’t gonna work for all situations, but it’s a good way to distract yourself from those thoughts"
depression,ff2i7h7,t3_era6ur,1579507243.0,"Well, I think your brain has started to get bored and wants change. What you can do is:
-Try to introduce a new variable into your schedule. Something unusual that your brain will pay attention to
-Look into all the little things. Taking in every moment helps you cherish them more
-Stop saying you can’t have problems because you’re not in a tough situation. Depression affects the best of us, don’t beat yourself up for having feelings!

Hope this helps"

I bought a prepaid phone plan from T-Mobil’s, which you pay for every month. You can set it up to go automatically by setting up AutoPay, which I did. First month goes by, they tell me I didn’t have AutoPay set up. I set it up again.

Second month, they tell me I didn’t set up AutoPay again. I set it up again, p which takes longer than last time.

Third month, they tell me I didn’t set up AutoPay AGAIN. I set it while being VERY FIRM that I had to get this resolved 

Fourth month, they tell me there was an error in the system and tell me I HAVE TO SET UP AUTOPAY AGAIN TO FIX THEIR ISSUE

Fifth month, they tell me THERE WAS ANOTHER ERROR IN THE SYSTEM and that I have to set up AutoPay YET AGAIN

Sixth month (AKA the last straw), they tell me THERE WAS YET ANOTHER ERROR IN THE SYSTEM AND THAT IT’S ALMOST CERTAIN THAT IT WILL BE A RECURRING ISSUE

After that, I tell them that I was done with their service and was going to take it elsewhere. Luckily, Sprint took me in and gave me everything I needed, including unlimited service over the 5 gigabytes I had before.

T-Mobile, if you’re reading this, fuck you."
