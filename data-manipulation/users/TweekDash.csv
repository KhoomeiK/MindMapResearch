Jump ahead about 5 years, I'm playing Call of Duty: Black Ops on Xbox Live and become friends with this guy who supported the same football team, and I realise he only lives two roads away from me. During this period of my life I was spending 10+ hours a day on Xbox with this same small group of people from around the UK who I felt a really close bond with. One day in a call I mention the story of how I got sucker-punched, and my friend goes ""Was that by the Halifax?"" and I didn't even want to respond, I waited about 10 seconds and shouted ""Did you fucking hit me Martin?"" and he goes (while choking on his own laughter) ""I'm so sorry [u/Tweekdash]"".

He seems one of the best in the league at blocking shots but his short-passing and decision making leave me scratching my head. He has a good last-ditch tackle on him too. He's a good option for us but many people think he's our best player. Every match against an opponent from the top half of the table he is exposed and not enough people are talking about that.

Against Leicester he wouldn't come off the pitch when he was injured, 100% the reason for Leicester's first goal.
