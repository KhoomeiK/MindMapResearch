depression,fg0r1om,t1_fg0qsfd,1580413340.0,"Thank you. I wish it was that simple. Just for a brief time each day. I’m not greedy, but to “feel happy and good” for a while...I can’t even imagine that life."
depression,ffycs1z,t3_evp69q,1580343339.0,I lost 72 pounds in 1 year. Still depressed.
depression,ffwo096,t1_ffwd90i,1580306702.0,"I’m in Florida, U.S. and I’m paying $160 for a 15 minute visit to a psychiatrist every month so I can take drugs (that cost more money) so I can function/work to pay for this “course of treatment”.  Honestly - I need a job to pay for medication to get up and go to my job. What are we doing?"
depression,ffeyv62,t3_et5aar,1579870780.0,"I rarely brush my teeth when I’m down. I also don’t shower, eat or enjoy getting out of bed. But definitely teeth brushing is LOW on the list"
vagabond,ff94ed3,t3_esam80,1579704572.0,I’m from NC and it is pretty spectacular
depression,ff5x3by,t3_erqjbv,1579613137.0,I once debated throwing myself down a set of stairs in order to break my arm. That was it. Just a broken arm. I wanted to stop life for a week or two. Never had the guts but I still consider it.
Needafriend,fdqs6pf,t3_emozsc,1578673738.0,"Not in the UK, but I did the same thing while in high school. I stayed home, didn’t go out, etc... there is SO MUCH MORE fun to be had! I’m 40+ and honestly this is my breakdown:
Teens - people your age everywhere. Everyone is looking for friends 
20s - no clue what I’m doing, but learning a lot. Going out, having fun and planning things
30s - what am I doing? I don’t know. But I found a “tribe” of people like me along the way. Decent job. More money to do more stuff I like
40s - figuring it’s out as you read this. 
Everything is temporary. There is so much more waiting for you. Promise."
introvert,fdnk64u,t3_em5g4r,1578587506.0,"So relatable. I hate small talk. I want to get INTO IT if we’re having a convo. But most people want to leave things on the surface, chit chat. And I don’t see the point."
