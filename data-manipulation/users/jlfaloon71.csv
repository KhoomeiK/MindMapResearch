depression,fe5cbol,t1_fe4wyzr,1578867642.0,Not everyone here is trying to hurt others. Yes I'm in the same situation. I've battled being abused my entire life. From my dad my x husband and now my son. I have day's that I don't get dressed or get out of bed. I care less and less about myself. My brother blew his head off because of the abuse he suffered from our dad. Please feel free to talk/text me anytime!!
