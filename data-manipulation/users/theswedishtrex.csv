Also, it's fucking sad that husband doesn't realise wife wants him to pay attention and that wife doesn't realise husband wants to watch sports. I feel like this whole thing could have been avoided if they didn't try to multi-task."

horizon,fdeupxg,t3_ekz77b,1578346999.0,"SPOILERS BELOW! 

I think it would be cool for the story to take place during the Faro Plague. Even though we know what happens, it could still be really impact full. Like, the people being drafted, having hope in Zero Dawn and Sobeck, slowly realising that there's no way they're gonna win this. It would probably be pretty fucking sad and dark, but I still think it would be cool. It was because of those people that Zero Dawn could succeed. 

A bit similar to how RDR2 handled being a prequel, managing to make it extremely emotional despite everyone knowing how everything eventually turned out."
