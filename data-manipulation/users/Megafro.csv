joinsquad,ffvqws0,t1_ffvqgpo,1580270756.0,If its referring to what I think then its when the server is like 20v20 (thats the amount on most servers) and you have to fight over objectives instead of going anywhere else and on a server I played on yesterday you couldn't use armour or be commander or build placements until its 18v18 so basically it encourages people to fight over the main objectives instead of building strong fobs or doing anything else

joinsquad,ffrs2l5,t3_euu0tc,1580164565.0,"Probably the 2 times I slaughtered a squad alone

First one was on Belaya I was just walking through the woods and loading an rpg when suddenly infront of me there are 3 enemies, I kept walking for another 2 seconds until turning back and getting down on a small slope but they hit me so I started bleeding, I went a back and from the side and then sprayed down 3 of them, went back, reloaded, then come forward and shot down like 2 more people who were crawling, then I went into a bush and bandaged myself and went back to finish off a medic

And 2nd there was an enemy hab inside a bunker at that small air base in the southern part of that airfield on talil outskirts, they had a TOW installed, machine guns installed, and like 3 other people just spraying towards iraqi hangars with their own LMG's and nobody was doing anything and so after having a few long range gunfights with them I decided to go all the way around all of the walls so that they don't notice me, I slowly went up the bunker and killed like 5 of them in a spray but got killed by a guy who was coming up from the other side.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Killed like 5-6 people on Belaya while bleeding and sprayed down a firing squad on Talil Outskirts"
