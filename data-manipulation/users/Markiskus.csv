I work for a small independent work 9-5 and have about a 10 minute commute. I openly admit that I have depression, so if work gets to the stress levels I've seen at many chains, I just shut down. I earn probably 40% under industry average for my area but, I can definitely say I'm much happier, and feel some sort of peace. But again, this is your life and your decision, my friend.

SecondGalaxyM,fenk1ip,t1_fenedu7,1579286360.0,"I'm not a huge fan of the vanguards, I've lost 3 berserks in wormholes (sad days indeed) but i keep going back to them due to price/benefit considerations. you can buy a berserk for less then a revolution for a long time now, and that price holds even after the buff. and I'm a big proponent of ignoring the (lets say) suggested weapon for each class ship, unless by chance the desired ship and weapon coincide. I would say the most fun i have with the game is doing wormholes, and my best recruit is cruiser class, so I've noticed the sentinel class is favored (at least in wormholes) above the genbu and canticle line, at least in the realm I'm in.

And yes, centurion is a support ship thru and thru, but there is much value in that. I actually equip it with lasers and youd be suprised how many ships I've gotten final hit with in that support ship. That said, the SD is shit. 

Blasters are my most researched weapon atm, and it kinda ties in with my first paragraph. I am constantly seeing, kingsgaurds and guardians in wormhole. I have plans to eventually research fortress and make some sort of tanky blaster ship, but def will not use missles with that ship. 

Yeah no doubt its rare to see anything besides OE BSs in wars, and i remembers 1-2 wars where they got tricky with equipping rails, I think we lost that one, but it was a while back. I think their were a few T3 ships on the field as well from N13 using revelations with rails. They absolutely shredded."
SecondGalaxyM,fencpp5,t1_fen4fzi,1579281876.0,"Wow, really appreciate you distilling this information. this is awesome. I would say that you may have overlooked the sentinel in your assessment of NEF ships, as well as the centurion. Its a shame too bc resistance wise, with everyone and their sister using either lasers or rails in pvp they should have more potential then they actually do. And further, bc so few use NEF, blasters also kinda get pushed aside."
SecondGalaxyM,fenc3gm,t1_fen5cy2,1579281496.0,"oh yeah, definitely. What i was trying to say in my comment without actually saying that lol. timing, staggering targets etc. really need to work out the rhythm to maximize potential."

SecondGalaxyM,fek9ext,t3_epb8i7,1579195353.0,"In my experience, missiles are great for pve and bad for pvp (unless you solo pvp). Early in the game i focused missiles then switched to blasters eventually. I found in large scale fleet battles, my missiles would launch and everyone else would shoot their lasers and boom, target is dead before even one of my missiles even touched it. 

I also found missiles to be the most fun to use, because its all about timing. you need to know when to switch targets or stagger the firing so that dps is never lost on aiming at dead targets. Every other weapon type is basically shoot what everyone else is shooting at and hope you get the last hit for the loot."

I don't have to be the one to tell you to really try and give witcher 3 a real shot, but the thing that really got me into witcher was just how different each quest was. Yeah it has some boring fetch quest components (finding armor and weapon schematics) but all in all, the diversity of how each quest unfolded really was immersive. 

I think i saw someone reccomend dragon age origins, and i think this will also be a great RPG to get into. its been a number of years since i last played it, but i fondly remember my time with that rpg as well, and def consider it to be one of the best i've played of all time. lots of things to do, party based combat (bored of tanking? switch to mage. everyone dieing? switch to healer etc), story is good, and it wasn't overly difficult, but keeps you thinking."

I mean shit, the amazon is a RAIN forest, water everywhere for helicopters and planes to pick up.  Hell what about california, they love big government over there and yet fire still spread.

I would assume the CoGS would be 10 cents, regulatory would be much higher per unit or a flat rate, and then the manufacturer cut would added on top as cost plus pricing which would included fixed asset costs, depreciation coverage, and the desired profit. I couldn't imagine her margin would be that great with contract manufacturing and thus really push back a break-even point much less a reinvestment point.

Edit: Apparently from the link, the original article not on FEE, state that the father ""matched"" the investment. I am still skeptical on this notion as I believe it would cost considerably more to sell 70,000 lolipops. To add Fee quotes the original investment from the girl to be 3,500 but the linked ""today"" article says she invested 3,750."

It is law in the US that you cannot discriminate, and further, you cannot make someone give you their health information. Americans with Disabilities act, look it up. You can sue them and the hospital/ doctor for breach of privacy (HIPPA) AND discrimination (ADA).
