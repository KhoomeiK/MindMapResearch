Hint: it wasn't illegal.  

Does a president have the ability to investigate credible allegations of corruption? If the answer is yes, game over for the democrats.  And the answer IS yes."
politics,fg1g9q2,t1_fg1epkv,1580426561.0,"It wasn't even potentially illegal.  Running for president doesn't make your entire family immune from investigation.  It was a legitimate ask.

""Look in to this specific thing"" vs. ""Fabricate dirt""

They are not the same."
politics,fg1cuye,t1_fg1br4h,1580424867.0,"Again, that is not at all what his argument is.  Did you listen to the entire thing, with questions?  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt here. but that is the interpretation of the MSM and House managers.  Which is deliberately mis-framing his argument.  Not surprising, because it is completely damning to their case."
politics,fg1bdkb,t1_fg155w6,1580424144.0,"The argument is that if a politician does something that they believe benefits the country AND their re-election efforts, this is not impeachable just because it helps them politically.  You may disagree about whether it benefits the country, but that doesn't mean you can throw them out of office.  Every politician does things all the time that benefit them politically; it is always a consideration."

It's the difference between tax breaks for businesses and investment in things that actually make us stronger, vs. giving benefits directly to people who don't contribute anything to society.

I'll take a job in a strong economy over government handouts any day."
worldpolitics,ffxda10,t1_ffxc8dn,1580322789.0,"You seem to have a pretty good grasp on it, so let's go with your info.  20-39. You specifically said ""younger millenial"", taking about 10 years off your age.

Comments are public for a reason.  It's so you can figure out who you are talking to and get some context.  I am talking to someone who lies for no reason to complete strangers."

You might find me detestable IRL.  It's very possible.  I would not judge you as unintelligent because an inside joke from T_D went over your head.   

We undoubtedly have some profound ideological differences.  Accusing me of being dumb, however, I will not grant you."
