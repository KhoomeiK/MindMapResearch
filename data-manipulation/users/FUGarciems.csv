AlAnon,ffnf312,t1_ffncgg0,1580065155.0,I’m just trying to save you from hell I’ve been through with my own delusions— of waiting until he got better and could love me... My heart is broken and smothered and just repairing my own self at this point.
AlAnon,ffn7kc1,t1_ffkdgt2,1580062834.0,I think you need to be honest with yourself. If he drinks that much he is not loving himself. So he can’t love you like you deserve until he quits drinking and does years of recovery. Sorry for the blunt truth.
AlAnon,ffh5ski,t3_et293k,1579923899.0,"I totally feel you. I could have written the same. I too hate myself for it. It’s so difficult and I too am trying to just understand why I did it to myself. But the good news is, you’ve made a breakthrough with your realization that it’s not healthy for you and that you deserve better. Keep reading these posts along with the Codependency Reddit stream and your brain will slowly defragment and heal. I’ve just started myself. It’s the most pain I’ve ever endured, but it is a journey to real happiness. Good luck—never forget that you are here in this life now and deserve to smile, not cry."
AlAnon,ffgwzp5,t1_ffgl8rv,1579917202.0,"I agree, although a year does mean something, it’s a life commitment of recovery. A year as a marker for progress can mean so much but also mean a lifetime yet still to heal."
AlAnon,fffwo3q,t1_fffgq7o,1579893436.0,"Well, it kind of fizzled out as he went in and out of recovery. We stayed as strong codependent partner/friends until recently when he told me he started seeing someone.  This was before Thanksgiving and it absolutely shattered me, even if my loss is irrational. I feel like I was his placeholder who kept trying to love him, kept him alive but was never good enough for him, but I was always waiting patiently for him to get better and finally have a healthy relationship. It never happened. I thought he found someone new as he had been sober the last year, and in a way, knowing he was sober and never gave me a chance with his sobriety was worse— I felt very used and betrayed (and still do, very severely). But he did call one night before Christmas and I could tell he had been drinking. So maybe he’s not sober? The codependent part of me hopes he felt some longing for me, but I’m sure he didn’t. I desperately still long for him but know my love for him is not reciprocated. So I just started officially blocking him on my phone, even though it still physically hurts to do so."
AlAnon,ffffk0j,t3_etaea5,1579882868.0,"I lived through the same exact thing. 7 years later,  he’s still drinking. Save yourself and let him repair himself solo. He can’t give you the love you deserve until he can love himself, and if he’s drinking, he’s not loving himself. Sorry, just want to save you from the hell."
AlAnon,ffd7ysy,t1_ffd6d5q,1579815180.0,"I thank you for your post and your effort to clarify. I was in a 7 year relationship with my ex bf and alcoholic and I once posted on AA Reddit bc I wanted to help recovering alcoholics understand the pain we, the codependent partners feel—-not sure if that was out of line. But we are certainly not enduring the disease in a vacuum! It’s a 2-way street."
antidepressants,fe9l5f6,t3_envoky,1578938965.0,Yes but at least they can advise on what is the safe approach...
Codependency,fe63ci7,t1_fe62y8n,1578880856.0,"Ugh, I’m so sorry. Yeah my ex bf got sober and found someone new too. And here I am. I was just a placeholder I guess. But he called me drunk since so I guess in the end it’s all for the best that I’m on my own. It just feels like a dream—-all that time loving and caring and in the end nothing back. All that matters in this life is love, so it’s nice to be loved back, even though I know we need to be happy with loving ourselves. I’m so sorry that you went through that. Just know you are not alone and you deserve love and happiness and if he can’t love you, time to smile and keep looking."
Codependency,fe62bb2,t1_fdzd746,1578880198.0,I’m that person with that wound. A relationship with an alcoholic. 7 years. Now I’m in my early 40s...It’s killing me. I’m broken. Like resentment and pain beyond repair.
antidepressants,fe61su1,t3_envoky,1578879868.0,Why not call your doctor or pharmacy?
AlAnon,fe5kgmy,t3_enta01,1578870557.0,"I’m so sorry. When I read these entries I always feel like I’m reading something I wrote myself. As I take a step back and have not talked to my ex bf and friend alcoholic in 12 days now, I don’t know what to say except that it won’t work out until they stop drinking. And they need to want to stop on their own. And when they do finally stop, they are not capable of giving you the love you need until they love themself.  And they can’t love themself until major therapy and self help. I’m so sorry. I’m in the same boat and this realization hurts. My heart is still aching, Horribly. I hope you are ok."
indie_rock,fe5ecey,t1_fe5bze2,1578868329.0,"Also, not quite Punk but you may enjoy The Mountain Goats, specifically “Going to Georgia”"

seniorkitties,fe4wzcz,t3_enpzcj,1578863562.0,What a loved angel. He’s in good hands. Love is all that matters.
dryalcoholics,fdx0esh,t1_fdwz3c1,1578764062.0,"I understand. Warning to NOT READ if this may trigger some feelings—I’m on the other side of alcoholism. My best friend and bf of many years is the alcoholic in my life. It’s definitely a codependence issue  (from both directions, shared responsibility). I must say with all honest—with his sobriety I still hold so much resentment for his years of neglect of me while he only could love alcohol. Just saying, there is healing that needs to happen in both sides, so with your sobriety, don’t expect everything (and everyone your disease and actions) have affected, to be magically fall into perfect place at the same time."
dryalcoholics,fdvtrzr,t3_en6wo6,1578751389.0,"Is it possible that now that you are not numbing the pain and in a fog, that the reality of life and its hardships are just more prevalent?"
cats,fdpb6ax,t3_em9s6d,1578624263.0,This is amazing footage!
offmychest,fdp78dq,t1_fdoxfxa,1578621627.0,Yes Trump has endangered us all.
offmychest,fdomks3,t3_emaut1,1578608208.0,This is horrible. I’m so sorry for your loss. It’s horrible that Trump’s incompetence and irrational attack is resulting in passenger planes being targeted now. I wish he would be removed before more innocent people die.
AlAnon,fdm90oj,t3_em3lcn,1578542810.0,Making a screenshot of your post.
antidepressants,fdc1pvb,t3_ekhf1e,1578265383.0,"I think hopefully you can stay on them for life if required to, but you have to realize it’s not a magic pill. Your body will keep changing with age, and these chemicals affect metabolic signaling pathways in your body, so the effect and associated side effects will change as you and your body ages. I wish it was as simple as taking a pill daily for life an experiencing a constant result, but it’s not. I’m a biochemist—don’t hate me, I just know the science. ;)"
Codependency,fdbda9f,t3_ekgi3o,1578256223.0,Thank you for sharing this. Taking a screenshot as my guide. ;)
alcoholicsanonymous,fda4skz,t3_ek5tmt,1578241668.0,I’m confused by the “we” as well. I dated an alcoholic for many years. It’s up to HIM to stop drinking—-or so I thought...
lexapro,fd6kzs3,t3_ek5wwe,1578192569.0,"Why would you not follow a physician’s recommendation? These are chemicals, not cotton candy."
AlAnon,fcvvj4s,t3_eis5rr,1578011056.0,"Thank you kindly for your support. This realization of myself hit me like a brick in the face. Long story short, I spent nearly 7 years of my life “saving” my bf alcoholic..and we had been on good terms but not dating anymore but then he found someone new after a year of sobriety and although rationally it was fine, my heart and soul fell into a gazillion codependent pieces.  Guess it was the reality of what you said—-that—all this years——was NOT A RELATIONSHIP, it was something else....and it hurts. And then he called me after my mental break down—-and he had been drinking. So yeah, not only did I ruin myself all those years, but I didn’t even “save him” like I had always hoped. Anyway, thanks for listening. I’m seeing a therapist but am trying to figure out if I belong at an al Anon meeting or a Codep meeting... Thanks for sharing your experience, it helps"
AlAnon,fcuz7v2,t1_fcuy5pb,1577991452.0,Thank you for your reply. I find your response very enlightening. ;) I hope it’s ok if I also ask—are you also a recovering alcoholic as well or only your partner is? I am not an alcoholic and my parents were not (although problem drinkers maybe...) but my ex bf WAS/IS and so I’m just starting to realize my codependence this past month and beginning to ask WHY I (think I) need these dysfunctional people in my life.
AlAnon,fcusis7,t1_fct91p1,1577987642.0,This is the most coherent overview of relationships with alcoholics that I’ve ever read.  Thank you. I’m making a screenshot so I can reference it always as a reminder to why I don’t want that anymore.
AlAnon,fctbnxm,t3_eipce5,1577938265.0,"Yup, I’m 43 now, 5months continued to ...7 years, and no change. He won’t give you the love you need or deserve. Take advice—-break the codependence before it starts!"
antidepressants,fcspp2b,t1_fcskc9u,1577921968.0,"Wellbutrin gave me really weird side effects too, and mostly hit in the evenings for me—mostly agitation, hyperventilating, night terrors, severe panic attacks. I never took with Prozac but Prozac alone I just got headaches at higher doses. I’d see your doc sooner or give a call."
AlAnon,fcs7lhm,t3_einanu,1577912561.0,"I attended meetings with my ex bf (alcoholic). I had the same fears. I too found it comforting at the time so take that all in and be positive.  Perhaps you will find happiness with your relationship. All in all, my bf did fall on and off the wagon and, well, after 7 years,  we didn’t work out. He can’t love anyone until he is sober for years and has gone through major therapy for years, I find. Good luck to you, and keep communicating."
alcoholicsanonymous,fcr4mrr,t3_eigtjb,1577896720.0,I’m sorry to say it but he won’t be able to have you in your life (like you truly deserve) until he’s recovered.  And it will be years. I could have written the same as what you wrote like 7 years ago—just want to tell you to put yourself first and don’t get into a codependent situation like I did if you can save yourself.
AlAnon,fcqxy1j,t1_fcp8vnl,1577893881.0,Both—and he did stop drinking but still doesn’t love himself enough yet to love anyone else. And probably never will.
AlAnon,fcqxri8,t1_fcp4r8k,1577893809.0,These are great questions that make me realize that half of my love is an illusion in my head.
offmychest,fcov24a,t3_ei7crt,1577842352.0,"I get it. I got a cat in 1998 after college. He was my soul mate in cat form until last year! He was 21 years old and the love of my life. He waited for me each day to get home from work, he helped me when I was sad, I took care of him from a baby to an old-man cat, I thanked him when I had to put him to sleep. He was my savior from depression, and he had a happy life, and I was happy— because of him, and that was good!"
AlAnon,fcos3a9,t1_fcoruok,1577840041.0,"I do feel like I’ve made progress forward, but I’ve also dug a much deeper hole, and realize that this hole was at least half dug by myself. Pain."
AlAnon,fcorpna,t1_fcorn4d,1577839753.0,And I’m totally in withdrawal. It’s sickening when I see it as it is....
AlAnon,fcorf9w,t1_fcoqx0o,1577839537.0,"Thanks I hang out on that Reddit group too. This “ codependency thing” is this weird new realization to me, which is nuts and also life changing and also scary."
lexapro,fcmyn83,t3_ehvs0c,1577797826.0,"I just wonder if all of these awful side effects are worth it. Side effects mean your body’s physiology is changing and responding to these chemicals. I’m not convinced it’s necessarily something you should “get through”. Pills are not magic, after all. This drug is seriously altering your body.."
antidepressants,fcm0m7u,t3_ehqb3y,1577761130.0,"I had “night terrors”, waking up out of dead sleep and pacing around my kitchen, almost psychotic doom feelings. That was after just a few days on WB, but it terrified me so much that I had to get off of it..."
AlAnon,fclwk8y,t3_ehvpc1,1577758210.0,"You are NOT an asshole. My basement was a 6 year storage facility for my ex (alcoholic) boyfriend’s stuff that I “managed”, moving his stuff in and out, and even getting suckered into bringing it to a storage facility and paying monthly fees that he did pay me back for, but ) I had to worry about monthly etc. You have enough of your own shit to worry about let alone his life in boxes. Believe me, it’s too much, not your job. I did it and I have regrets. Maybe tell him once he’s situated in rehab that he has to move his stuff by the end of the month?"
AlAnon,fclvva1,t3_ehpbg0,1577757728.0,"Yeah, he needs to realize it. I’m not sure but you can tell him you will not be ok with him moving back until 6 months in sober living. I made that ultimatum once—he left after one month though and somehow I gave in. Now, 7 years later, he’s been sober a year, is with someone new, and then he called the other night drunk. So let’s just say—-put your foot down and save yourself before it’s too late like it is for me."
AlAnon,fckcn4n,t1_fciwvrr,1577722332.0,"I’m sorry —it’s the last thing you want to hear, but he won’t change, not for you anyway. He needs to change for himself first."
AlAnon,fck71sf,t3_ehkiru,1577718390.0,Your story is the same as mine except that I’m 40-something...and he did “get better” but he chose someone else in the end. Or so I thought he got better—- because then he called the other night after I released all of my hurt and sadness (over my feeling like I was his placeholder)...and I think he was drinking again. It never ends. It’s so sad and heartbreaking for both people. Better to be on your own for sure. And in time find someone worthy of you.
AlAnon,fbzc0ft,t1_fbzbvpq,1577241676.0,Thank you Dora-0801!! Yes you too. We can be broken together.
