assholedesign,ffooiqa,t1_ffonvxb,1580079952.0,"No biggie, lol. It’s still a complete asshole that hands these types of things as tips."
assholedesign,ffonpgi,t3_eudmn4,1580079645.0,"This isn’t Mormon. They have pass along cards but nothing like this. Also Mormons don’t believe in hell. They call it outer darkness.

Edit: don’t get me wrong, Mormonism has its own “unique” beliefs, but this is not theirs."

exmormon,fe65mj2,t1_fe61e0d,1578882323.0,I will have to check it out.
exmormon,fe5vw19,t1_fe5sn5j,1578876119.0,Thank you.
exmormon,fe5dh41,t1_fe5as5w,1578868079.0,"Thank you. I’m completely out, my DH probably never will, but he is pretty progressive for a TBM. My daughter is 13 as well, I hope yours is doing well!"
exmormon,fe56cbs,t3_ent15s,1578866034.0,"Today’s lesson culminated with my child hiding in the bathroom in tears. But one positive came of this, she finally had enough and it sparked a very important conversation with her TBM father. As of now she is no longer going to be attending church meetings and activities, and he knows the truth of her orientation. 

I’m proud of her. She asked outright in class why gay marriage is bad, and of course got the standard issue answer. Now for the “check ins” to start. But she has mine and her fathers support. It’s been an emotional day."

exmormon,fcgmaom,t1_fcd80gg,1577641689.0,"I don’t know if this is helpful,  and I know it seems like a huge deal right now, but one failed semester does not mean your goals are completely derailed. You just might have to step back, take a deep breath and reevaluate the steps to your goal. Maybe that means taking a job, going to a community college first, getting a two year applied degree first. Hang in there! I will be cheering you on from MT."
