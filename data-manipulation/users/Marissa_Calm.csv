Are you serious? 

Being Gender non conforming is a thing. 

Women can wear everything men wear, and if any cismen wants to dress feminine he is suddenly trans? 

What?

What a horrible thing to say when you clearly stated what you are comfortable with...

This is absolutely shitty behavior... And he doesn't respect your judgement...

Also, he seems to have some deep inner conflict if he used such derogatory terms without asking you and grabbing you and talking transphobic stuff... Doesn't excuse his actions at all! ...but god damn that doesn't sound healthy...

The public conception of trans people is still just very infantile.

Say whatever you think is right, and even if it is not perfect as long as you don't deny that person all is well. Even the original poster was just slightly annoyed and doesn't care that much.

As an explanation, in general, most people don't like it if you treat their old and new identities like 2 different people.

A lot of people greeted met that way, and I would prefer something else, but I get the sentiment and I know it is meant well so it is fine. 

Maybe 3 things to avoid: ""

1. Making that person prove her existence/legitimacy.

2. Asking whats in their pants.

3. Treating them not like a normal person. 

However well you can.

AskReddit,ffhk6pa,t1_ffgn564,1579939030.0,"It is rather easy to prove that the patriarchy and cultural bias towards men exist.

**But!**

**1.** That has **nothing** to do with man vs women.  (Nearly as many women uphold and actively support the patriarchal society as men do) 

**2.** that has nothing to do with the suffering of one individual compared to another individual. 
(This is about societal pressures and issues)

**3.** the evaluation for the suffering and pain is only possible to evaluate relative to the cultural measuring stick/status quo, and as long as we look at our patriarchal culture from a patriarchal perspective, yes you can say women have it clearly worse in that regard. 
(But that doesn't mean there are not horrible gendered issues for man, or that feminine man doesn't also suffer from sexism towards women, or that the patriarchal perspective is far from the only valid perspective.) 

**4.** intersectionality is important just picking one factor to evaluate such an experience is bound to be fundamentally flawed.

wholesomememes,ffheymh,t1_ffhdpbg,1579932446.0,"This is just wrong on so many levels.

The predicted average tax profit you create for your country is **way** higher than 250k.

Destroying individual peoples economy with high random debt on the other hand snowballs quickly into a horrible life situation for that person creating a sizeable loss for the economy on many different layers. (E.g in this case the suicide of this man would have costed the state at least over a million dollar due to many factors.)

Protecting your people from these situations via a safety net is a netwin for the whole economy if it is well installed. 

And we are not even into ethics yet at that point.

All you do is put a pricetag on people, you say: ""human right is to be saved from a medical emergency as long as it costs x dollars."" 

Yes these decisions have to be made in practice. But that has nothing to do with ""human rights"".

Yes having the right to be saved if it is possible to safe your life for a peanut money amount especially if it is not your fault by any reasonable measure is pretty intuitive right? 

250 k for a human life... That is so wrong on all levels... 

In the best case you just know little about state economy.

honesttransgender,ffhds7g,t1_ffgo4vj,1579931168.0,"I see where you are coming from. 

But the people who hate me for my existence don't really care if I am pre or ""post-op"", most of them even prefer me to be ""post-op"" if that is the alternative to me not existing at all. 

As a classical binary all-inclusive transness is most comfortable for regressive of all kinds as it is easier to fit into a binary belief system.

A feminine presentation and the conviction that my chromosomes don't magically define the core of my existence is enough to make them deeply uncomfortable.

I study ""irrationality"" and this is a very common defense reaction to me threatening their comforting polarising base assumptions. 

I don't think most of them really care about dicks, but they absolutely care about what a dick represents. 

There are different kinds of discrimination.

Being AFAB and trying to be masculine gets a response like: ""know your place, you can't keep up"" delegitimizing ability and value.

Being AFAB and trying to be feminine is an insult to their ideology, it is a weakness and a flaw and needs to be treated or punched out of you.

It is different to be hated for what you are, or how you act. 

If they hate you for what you are they treat you horribly and push you into ""your place"", disrespect and dehumanize you as ""lesser"".

But if they hate you for how you act, then they will try to change you, torture you, and despise you, and if you don't budge, and you are not alone... Find a category outside their ingroup and dehumanize you all the same...

There is no comparison here. There are just two different ways of being treated inhumanely. 

(Yes i am refering to certain landmasses patriarchal main stream culture. obviously there are smaller cultural pockets inside and outside with different or even reversed conceptions.)"
honesttransgender,ffgm1dw,t3_etg1i4,1579909365.0,"**Disclaimer:** To all readers not clear about the subtleties of gender theory, this comment is extremely simplified on many fronts and doesn't deliver a complete explanation in any sense and is from different ideological points of view easy to misunderstand, it presumes an optimistic reading and if you can't do that just don't engage with this comment it will just create pointless misunderstandings, I am writing this for OP.

I wouldn't personally be that Freudian genital about it, as I don't think it is necessary. But the symbolic penis is obviously a great summary.

Just Basic societal sexism is likely a large part.

If a man is feminine that is a problem because women = bad. 

If a woman is masculine it is more normal because man = good.

Another likely important factor is transmen being generally better at passing especially due to hormones affecting their voice, and not passing often doesn't seem trans to the uneducated public ""just a tomboy"".

Male culture and archetypes are just more valued in a patriarchal society. So that is just more relevant and jarring to that culture.

I think sexism is likely part of the explanation of the discrepancy of the commonality between male and female trans people, but that is a more complex subtle topic.

To be clear, my point is **not**: transwomen have it harder, we have very different and unique challenges. And as a bonus pretty much all transmen suffered direct sexism in their childhood which sucks a lot.

To the point of "" the pain of invisibility and denialism"" here an awesome talk about bisexuality that talks about that aspect really well https://youtu.be/Oa6AnOCQD50
