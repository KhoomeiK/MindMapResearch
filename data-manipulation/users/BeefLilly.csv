Also reminds me of a time where i pulled it left off the tee, and had a decent lie in the rough with nothing but fairway in front of me. That and two trees that framed my shot, but the gap was huge. Like 50-60 feet apart. I line up my shot in between the gap(again, plenty of room!), and drill my 3 wood into the tree on the right. Luckily it didn't come back at me, but i'm very familiar with hitting the objects I never thought I would hit when lining up a shot."

This conversation right now is about the platform he’s running on. He’s mentioned “starting a revolution” over and over again. Yang wants to evolve our nation into the 21st century. Bernie’s platform doesn’t do that. I’m sorry, but to me, it comes off as sticking it to the man. Also, if Bernie were to win the presidency, he’d do a great job I’m sure, but I think it still would be putting a bandaid on something that needs stitches."
