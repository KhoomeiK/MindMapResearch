Personally I also think we're soft. I just left for deployment, was going through my stepmom album. She had pictures of her father, building his homes, serving, and that post war mentality they all had of conserve. People actually conserved and re-used, because all sorts of materials were diverted to the war effort. All this bullshit about save the earth Reddit loves doesnt change the fact I got issued 4 sets of new uniforms on top of the 4 I already have, all in plastic. The utility is useless, it's  a cushy contract for vendors to make gear. We say we want to go green, but everyone wants a Tesla rather than a good public bus. A lot of the 'make america great' is lip service from both sides, and wont change until  it's too late not to. 'Impressionable 18 year olds' is a joke, were all impressionable at all ages.

We're always struggling to get recruits, taking out high school seniors would hurt numbers. NG units all over have been in the negatives. Also if we had to go to war again like surge levels, the age limit would not stick.

Upping the age limit to 21 would push a lot of 18 year olds to pursue either a degree or a vocation/trade. 3 years of education or work experience is going to change the minds of a lot who think about signing up. Loan repayments  is a big carrot to people, and you're talking a 3 year exclusion zone. The most likely pool would jump to 21-22, prime years for a lot of graduates or soon to be looking for tuition assistance. 

But maybe I'm just old and bitter now. I signed up at 18, and not everything was peachy but I definitely did fine and learned a lot. I feel like 21 is an excuse for people to push off responsibility for their own lives, and either parents are too protective or have done zero parenting."

gamedesign,fdq9a5p,t3_emkt81,1578660008.0,"I'm designing a similar game, but still early on. I'd check out desktop dungeons as a terrific example of bite sized quests, and Tabletop RPGs and Majesty are two games that I'm really focusing on as sort of the feel and aim.

My advice is make a simple not exhaustive skill system. Tabletops do this by usually limiting player characters to lvl 20, and each lvl you pick and choose skills that all are helpful in different ways, it's more to do with the environment, the narrative, and how you play the character.  A charismatic charmer  might be less able to fight, but they dont need to if they can sweet talk a shopkeeper to divulge information. Rather than making a difference between botanist and chemist, make a science skill and that gives a minor bonus to any research oriented rolls.

Limit progression, make it about the greater story. This allows you to have multiple characters per player and if they really like a specific character they could still play them, but they eventually stop growing. Characters 'given up' to the system can be killed off for story progressions or just become NPC's to flesh out the world.

The story is the meat and potatoes. Playing tabletops I realized the combat dice rolls were dull to me - what really made for a good session was players and a DM intent on creating a story, much like a good t.v show. I'll admit this is the hardest part I'm stuck at, how do you code an engaging game that essentially tries to mimic a classic TV episode where players pickup a character and play a game of TV Tropes. Tabletops are very off the cuff while cinematics are inherently  rigid. Consider having a player be a DM, presiding over the others actions and guiding along the session."

""FOCUS YOUR SHOTGROUP PRIVATE""

We spend weeks shooting in Army basic. A lot can affect your shooting, I initially struggled with getting good shots, only to follow it up with a mag that looked like ass.

That's life in a nutshell. Anyone can hit a target, but it takes focus and consistency to hit the same spot each time. For shooting, its breathing techniques, resting my eye shut rather than moving my cheek off the guard; catch phrases after a bad shot like ""reset"". Most important  was daily routine, and not taking the last score into the next round. 

By the end of training, I remember hitting nearly all my targets. When I went up, they told me I shot 23/40. I was dismayed, I wanted to call bulshit; the guy to my left apparently hit 38/40, something he didnt do the whole time in training. I graduated with a regular pass, he left with an expert badge. That resentment stayed with me awhile, and it's a feeling I've met countless times in hundreds of scenarios in my life. Getting passed on promotions, picked last in gym, or not bieng even seen by your high school crush.

It's pointless to worry though. I learned to become accurate and precise, on and off the range. I regularly shoot 38+ for every weapons qual, and I pride myself in it. I strive to focus my shot group in all walks of life. Sit on my ass all day and dont clean the house? ""Focus your shot group"". I'm up the next cleaning. Anyone can be accurate, but precision is a choice, a way of life.

Recently I was at a bonfire, we all got drunk and the next morning they pull out a few air guns. Lazily two friends are trying to hit the Red circle of a Miller lite some 25 yards away, not exactly technical stuff. After a half dozen missed shots, they joke and toss me the rifle for my turn. BB after BB I slowly open a hole in the red, and they're hyped as all hell. They asked me how I got so good and it made me smile. It felt like the work I've been putting into my life, all that struggle and frustration was vindicated. I was full of pride when I looked up at them with a smile and told them:

""I just focused my shot group""

gamedesign,fdq9a5p,t3_emkt81,1578660008.0,"I'm designing a similar game, but still early on. I'd check out desktop dungeons as a terrific example of bite sized quests, and Tabletop RPGs and Majesty are two games that I'm really focusing on as sort of the feel and aim.

My advice is make a simple not exhaustive skill system. Tabletops do this by usually limiting player characters to lvl 20, and each lvl you pick and choose skills that all are helpful in different ways, it's more to do with the environment, the narrative, and how you play the character.  A charismatic charmer  might be less able to fight, but they dont need to if they can sweet talk a shopkeeper to divulge information. Rather than making a difference between botanist and chemist, make a science skill and that gives a minor bonus to any research oriented rolls.

Limit progression, make it about the greater story. This allows you to have multiple characters per player and if they really like a specific character they could still play them, but they eventually stop growing. Characters 'given up' to the system can be killed off for story progressions or just become NPC's to flesh out the world.

The story is the meat and potatoes. Playing tabletops I realized the combat dice rolls were dull to me - what really made for a good session was players and a DM intent on creating a story, much like a good t.v show. I'll admit this is the hardest part I'm stuck at, how do you code an engaging game that essentially tries to mimic a classic TV episode where players pickup a character and play a game of TV Tropes. Tabletops are very off the cuff while cinematics are inherently  rigid. Consider having a player be a DM, presiding over the others actions and guiding along the session."

""FOCUS YOUR SHOTGROUP PRIVATE""

We spend weeks shooting in Army basic. A lot can affect your shooting, I initially struggled with getting good shots, only to follow it up with a mag that looked like ass.

That's life in a nutshell. Anyone can hit a target, but it takes focus and consistency to hit the same spot each time. For shooting, its breathing techniques, resting my eye shut rather than moving my cheek off the guard; catch phrases after a bad shot like ""reset"". Most important  was daily routine, and not taking the last score into the next round. 

By the end of training, I remember hitting nearly all my targets. When I went up, they told me I shot 23/40. I was dismayed, I wanted to call bulshit; the guy to my left apparently hit 38/40, something he didnt do the whole time in training. I graduated with a regular pass, he left with an expert badge. That resentment stayed with me awhile, and it's a feeling I've met countless times in hundreds of scenarios in my life. Getting passed on promotions, picked last in gym, or not bieng even seen by your high school crush.

It's pointless to worry though. I learned to become accurate and precise, on and off the range. I regularly shoot 38+ for every weapons qual, and I pride myself in it. I strive to focus my shot group in all walks of life. Sit on my ass all day and dont clean the house? ""Focus your shot group"". I'm up the next cleaning. Anyone can be accurate, but precision is a choice, a way of life.

Recently I was at a bonfire, we all got drunk and the next morning they pull out a few air guns. Lazily two friends are trying to hit the Red circle of a Miller lite some 25 yards away, not exactly technical stuff. After a half dozen missed shots, they joke and toss me the rifle for my turn. BB after BB I slowly open a hole in the red, and they're hyped as all hell. They asked me how I got so good and it made me smile. It felt like the work I've been putting into my life, all that struggle and frustration was vindicated. I was full of pride when I looked up at them with a smile and told them:

""I just focused my shot group""

Unfortunately for her she cannot kill me, though not for a lack of trying."

You dont need to be psychic hell just tell me who frequents the bars and who tends to stay in and is doing coursework. Show me who is saving their money for a house or some other goal vs who is wearing a new set of fresh civvies or got a new PS4. Education and economics are the easiest indicator of an individual, it's why we use it for security clearances."

I dont advocate seeing a sex worker, but ud much rather the two parties involved can do their business safely while the police find the unregulated because they're underage or exploited for it. Imagine all the time and resources that can be moved and refocused that way, plus youd have workers in the field not afraid to assist. It would completely change the situation."

Meanwhile Avionics and Crew Chiefs out freezing and swearing at New Years snow only to be dejected when they miss chow and the Amn forgets to bring them a boxed lunch again.

You could also argue that a person who got a job without a drug test has proven through, education, certs, or references that they're worthy of higher money(power) and so dont need to follow the laws of the poor. It goes against what our nation stands for....but since when has anyone actually meant what they say?"

How do I get her okay with bieng picked up, or to lay down while TV rather than just before bed? Shes just shy of 2 years, found her as a stray kitten so I'm assuming it'll take time and as she gets older, she'll want to cuddle more."

videos,fc2qav9,t1_fc25g7x,1577370848.0,"Ok well another way to think about it is imagine if when you opened your wallet, you could instantly see all your funds in every account you have, and you could transfer those funds instantly to whomever like handing a dollar bill. Better yet, nobody could steal from your wallet, because its secured.

That's essentially what blockchain enables. It cuts out the middle man (bank) need to verify and transfer costs plummet because of this; it's also useful in that it's not tied to a single currency making it easily transferable, like any country that has adopted metric is able to easily share goods without mathematical wizardry. 

The real genius however cant be seen until it was mass adopted, but it's also dangerous for the fiscally irresponsible. Imagine if your in Instagram, and you see one of those ads for say an ugly xmas sweater that you like. Rather than clicking it to go to a store page, and having to choose a card etc. Vendors could simply bake the payment screen into the advert. Simply tap, review and buy without going to other pages. Now do this with every site that uses this. Essentially itd be Venmo, for every store you've ever used or seen, regardless of physical location."

Also, you had some good movement but dont be scared of repeating a note or a nice progression. Give it a few runs and play with the timing, that alone is just as important as finding the next good note."
