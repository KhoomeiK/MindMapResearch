>The AR4 (Trenberth et al., 2007) concluded that it was likely that there
had been increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g.,
95th percentile) over the second half of the 20th century within many
land regions, even in those where there had been a reduction in total
precipitation amount, consistent with a warming climate and observed
significant increasing amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere.
Increases had also been reported for rarer precipitation events (1-in-50
year return period), but only a few regions had sufficient data to assess
such trends reliably.

Basically there is likely increasing extreme weather, but there's not much data (that's the nature of extreme weather) so they can't say for sure what the exact effects are."

>The supernatural does not exist BY DEFINITION.

That's simply not true in any way. Nothing about the definition of ""supernatural"" precludes it from existing.

>Seriously - name a SINGLE extant supernatural thing.

That's the argument that because we haven't experienced it it doesn't exist, not that it can't exist by definition.

>Basically, if there were a god that can take actions the results of which humans can perceive then that god would have been discovered by now.

See the definition of supernatural.

>(Disagree? You don't know enough physics to disagree.)

You may not be wrong, but you sound pretty douchey.

>Thermodynamics - if there is a god, where does he get his energy?

See the definition of supernatural.

>Reality does not care what you believe, what your opinion is, how you perceive it, how badly you wish it to be otherwise. Reality is natural, material, objective, and anthropic. Disagree and reality itself will correct you eventually. (And reality is totally amoral, impartial, and unfeeling.)
