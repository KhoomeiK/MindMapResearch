AskProgramming,fex9snx,t3_equ0uk,1579427398.0,"If you're sick of looking for a job, freelancing might not be a great fit. Finding a client is pretty much the same as applying for a job, except you'll be doing it continuously.

Also, if you're intending to work remotely, you need to understand that it's a global market. Any client you bid for is going to be flooded with offers from people all over who will do the same thing you will, but for pennies.

That said, it is possible to build a career doing this, and many people are quite successful at it. But in my opinion, it's much easier to make a stable income with a regular paycheck. At least until you have some experience under your belt.

If this is something you really want to do, try to find a niche. Back when I was freelancing, I had pretty good luck getting Spanish speaking clients, because there were relatively few Spanish speaking developers on the platform, so less competition. I still didn't get enough work to live off of, but it did help me get enough experience to get a full time position later on. My Spanish isn't even very good."

bestof,fetel36,t1_feq599p,1579374616.0,">I define power as the ability to make decisions that affects others without their consent.

Wait, so getting people to consent to follow you or be ruled is not a form of power? It's only power if you force people to do what you want when they don't want to?

By that definition, Kim Jong Un is probably the most powerful ruler in the world. The president of the United States, on the other hand, has no power, since the people elect their own leaders and consent to be governed.

Obviously, this is not accurate. Power is the ability to accomplish your goals. The United States, with consent and cooperation from other nations, can put sanctions in place to economically crush North Korea when they want to. North Korea is powerless to retaliate in kind.

Zero sum games mostly exist in textbooks or contrived situations. In real life, most situations are non-zero sum games, where individuals benefit more by cooperating with each other. It's kinda the entire basis of civilization.
