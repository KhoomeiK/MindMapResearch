fatlogic,feexnuj,t3_eomg76,1579043464.0,"I still live with my parents, and we also have a treadmill and a weight machine.

two summers ago I realised I really needed to lose a little bit of weight (I'm overweight, but not so overweight that I'm at risk of anything) so I decided to use said treadmill.

now, my mom (my non-biological one- I have two) started having foot problems quite a few years ago because my sister was being a brat and made her harm it. she's been having surgeries, taking pain meds, and the like since then. she is extremely grumpy and gets mad if she doesn't get her way when she is in pain. she's also morbidly obese.

my mama (my biological one) is also obese but is actually a chill person. not much other to say other than she keeps my mom in check.

now, the treadmill is in my parents room, and my mom used to watch tv a lot in said room. I told them both when I started exercising that I was going to start at 12 o clock and then end at 1. for the most part, my mom paid attention to the time and wasnt in the room when I wanted to work out because I wanted to watch tv while I did it. of course, there were a few times where she was in a lot of pain, but I just used Netflix/Hulu on my phone and plugged in ear buds. no big deal.

it wasn't until late that summer before school started back up when we started having problems. I would come in, and my mom would get hissy and mad. it eventually got to the point where she tried to GUILT TRIP me out of exercising. how did she guilt trip me?

""you dont need to work out! I'm in pain, and you're not fat!""

I haven't been able to exercise since then. I keep trying to get into it, but what she said makes me not want to do it because I'm scared of confrontations."

it wasn't like she broke my heart or anything (we dated for like, 3 days before I found out) so it's more of just a sour memory than anything lol

her and I have the same first hour and we're only mutual because we are both friends with this other girl. other than that we hate each other's guts. we are two COMPLETELY contrasting personalities. looking back on it now, I have no reason as to what I was thinking when I agreed to date her..."
