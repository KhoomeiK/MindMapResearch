personalfinance,fggvros,t1_fgggrdm,1580770657.0,"TurboTax in particular benefits from charging so little. It reels in customers, and all the while they lobby to make taxes more difficult.

Of course though, whenever a product is free, it means _you_ are the product. I am sure by using CreditKarma, I agreed to certain details being sold (even if anonymized) to third parties. But, I am OK with this because I'd rather not lobby against simpler taxes. (IDK if the recent IRS Free File situation affects ad dollars these sites can generate from your data.)

At the end of the day, it's important to look out for yourself. If you're unable to afford to hire an accountant, at least you're doing something to get your taxes out on time. But do know that TurboTax and others use dark patterns to force you in a paid direction, even if it's not needed. Like I said, my donations last year did not outweigh the standard deduction, so an itemized return wasn't needed. But because I answered YES to donating in 2018, TT sent me down the paid path. Even if I changed my response, I was locked in unless I restarted my session entirely.

Between what OP, me, and others have to say about TurboTax, use it to help shape your own views around this stuff. I hope whatever software/service you use this year is helpful!"

personalfinance,fgg2dbe,t3_ey8l7i,1580752753.0,"Please don't use Intuit services. They over complicate on purpose and lobby to make US taxes difficult.

Last year I used Credit Karma. I tried turbo tax only because it had my information from the year prior. I entered how I made donations. Even though it wasn't enough to beat the standard deduction, TurboTax forced me into a path where I HAD to pay for premium to support itemized deductions, even though doing so would mean nothing in the end.

There was no back button to this. I had to restart the entire process. I went with Credit Karma after this, and because I heard a lot about it online. I was pleased with the results for being free. I'll use them again probably."
AskReddit,fg7qect,t3_exbcj3,1580598851.0,"Not everyone can obtain a diagnosis. It's especially hard for women, since doctors still only see it as a something that can only be detected in childhood and mostly in boys. Self-diagnosis is valid.

Listen to autistic voices. Follow #ActuallyAutistic online. Avoid Autism Speaks, anti-vaxxers, or anyone claiming a cure. These groups want to minimize autistic voices and basically help myths around it to grow. Like it only affecting children, or that being autistic means the end of the world.

It's possible some autistics may not want to be autistic. But these things usually come from the disgruntled parent thinking their child is a burden. If you aren't ready to have a child who's autistic, queer, disabled, etc, you aren't ready for a child, period."

Recipe if you're curious. I recommend adding more of the condiments/spices in the dressing, and drizzling much more onto the veggies and chicken.
