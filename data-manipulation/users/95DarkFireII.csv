No, because consent only matters where it makes a difference, i.e. behaviour of other people. Consent literally means ""to feel together"".

Consent does not apply to the sun since the sun is not a person.

> In this situation, the baby would be like the disease, not the person giving you the disease, because like the disease, the baby would be the one inside your body, which isn't consensual.

That is not what I said. I said that natural processes, like conception, do not require consent, because they happen on their own according to the laws of nature.

But if another person illegally **causes** a natural process to take place, we commonly consider that natural process illegal as well.

Think about it. If someone became infected with a virus on their own (no foul play or intent), would it make sense if they complained ""I was infected without my consent""?

And this is where we disagree. Because these rules are very nice between equal, grown up humans. But an unborn human has no choice but to depend on the mother.

But a healthy embryo/fetus is usually not about to die, so comparing them to braindead/dying people makes no sense.

My point remains: Whether someone is human or not depends on their biology/DNA and ability to grow into a human body, not their individual physical state."
TheRightCantMeme,ffi08sx,t1_ffhtkm6,1579961079.0,"> I don’t think that agreeing to sex is also agreeing to pregnancy, but even if it was, no one has the right to force a woman to continue to use her body (in a fashion that is extremely invasive and taxing) in a way she doesn’t want.

First of all, people can be held responsible for their actions, including sex, which is why men have to pay child support. If I throw a stone at someone and they (predictably) die, I cannot get out of it by saying that I didn't consent into the injury, only the throw.

However, because of the greater burden placed on females (not everyone with an uterus is a woman) during pregnancy, the deserve the chance to ""get out"" by abortion within an acceptable timeframe, or if there are medical reason or other circumstances (rape/incest).

> This is what we call bodily autonomy. The individual always rules their own person. 

This is a right and good idea in itself, but all freedoms can be infringed within reason by the rights of others or public interest. Abortion is such a case, because no individual can have the unregulated power over life and death of any human lifeform (except themselves, if of sound mind).

Finally, that was not what talking about. I merely pointed out that the concept of ""consent"" can only apply to actions taken by people, not natural processes.

You can apply the question of consent to the impregnation (sex/medicalfertilization), but not to the biological process of conception."

""Consent"" only applies to human behaviour. It determines whether an action performed by a person towards another person is acceptable or not.

Consent does not apply to the laws of nature. If you are get sunburned, is the sun ""evil"" because it burned you without consent?

I am not saying that an unwanted pregnancy has to be a good thing, I am saying  that the whole consent of ""consent"" cannot be applied to pregnancy, since it is a natural process.

However, if a person willfully caused you to become pregnant, it would be possible to apply the question of consent on that impregnation."

EDIT: I think you are confusing ""being human"" and ""being allowed to kill a human""

To clarify my point: Euthanasia is only done when death is inevitable, so killing the person will only shorten their death. But they are still 100% human, even though they are braindead or dying.

Context: *The Black Templars of the Helsreach Crusade have been fighting the overwhelming numbers of Greenskins on Armageddon for a month under the leadership of Reclusiarch Grimaldus. 25 Templars are dead, and noone of the rest expect to survive the Crusade. Many Progenoid Glands (Geneseed) have been lost or destroyed in battle.*

*Nerovar (""Nero"") is the Apothecary of the crusade and carries the burden of catalogueing the demise of every single brother and their Geneseed. The last death was Cador, as member of their command squad and a close friend. Nerovar has not taken it well, especially after Priamus the swordsman insisted on telling him that Cador died in a bad way (stabbed in the back).*
