shiba,fftkbdd,t1_fftjdg7,1580222776.0,Thanks :) We are currently getting her used to her new leash.
shiba,ffteysl,t3_ev3ku5,1580218609.0,Looks like there’s Husky in there. Beautiful!
shiba,fftewyj,t3_ev5odh,1580218565.0,"Some of you may worry she’s overweight, and you are right. She is a rescue from a shelter and came to us like this. We are doing lots of walks/play and cutting back on treats. Will post AFTER pic in about 6 months!"
sanfrancisco,fftdvpf,t3_ev1a0w,1580217663.0,Holy shit.
aww,ffjm15k,t3_etzh1e,1580001349.0,I heard that possums have very short life span.
nextfuckinglevel,ffeqrr5,t1_ffepker,1579860868.0,Americans would not buy this. This is otherworldly.
shiba,ff06zls,t1_feyuwsg,1579465827.0,They didn’t have too much info on the previous owners but apparently she was surrendered with a GSD and he got adopted out first. She had been at the shelter only two weeks before she came to us. We are starting her on a diet starting today.... she’s a bit overweight.
shiba,feymdjs,t1_feyb9ll,1579447546.0,She’s very well behaved and calm. Seems she was taken care of well. Our resident dog puts her in her place even though she’s half her weight.
shiba,fey7v01,t1_fewlbe4,1579441929.0,"She’s from a rescue group in VT. They say she’s 5 y.o. Owners surrendered her with another dog, but she seems to be in great shape (a little overweight)"
shiba,fey7p14,t1_fewu080,1579441864.0,I did find her through petfinder!
shiba,few6fj0,t1_fekt7ov,1579405952.0,How old is your Shiba? Mine stopped playing like this after 3 years old.
datingoverthirty,feqt7yz,t1_fep7ijq,1579345738.0,"She must love to cuddle with her dog, though?"
datingoverthirty,feqoqyg,t3_eqebr0,1579344331.0,It is often said that when someone annoys you intensely it is because you’re seeing a side of yourself in that person or a side of someone in your past who has affected you negatively.
aww,feln6i8,t3_eptgza,1579226185.0,Sounds like you created a monster.
rawpetfood,fekrbx2,t1_fekq580,1579206000.0,"I was given the same spiel from a vet in the form of articles and studies, etc.... then, he told me the best food to give my dog is Purina Dog Chow Complete. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I went home and re-read the ingredients over and over.  I did find that one vet did a study on the safety and efficacy of raw feeding in the UK. The reason why we are lacking scientific studies on raw is because there hasn’t been money put into research. If these companies want to keep selling their food, they will continue to fund and improve studies for their food. I don’t understand the whole comparing raw feeders to anti-vaxxers point but I would rather feed my dog natural foods than something with preservatives and artificial coloring like Dog chow."
shiba,fekcrn2,t3_epiv1x,1579197333.0,They love to put their chin on places. I love it!
Eyebleach,fek250a,t3_epl8pb,1579190993.0,I do this to my dog as well. I hope she likes it too.
newhampshire,fek1y57,t1_fek0roc,1579190876.0,"Yes, I believe so. We are renters so don’t have much choice in the heating other than supplementing with a space heater. Thanks for the info!"
rawpetfood,fejurjj,t3_epi3ov,1579186318.0,"Didn't doctors across the country over-prescribe opioids and contribute to the national crisis?  
Isn't there a problem with obesity in this country because we eat all the manufactured foods created by big corporations?  
Industries tells us to do things or not do things to benefit financially.   
I have been feeding my dog raw for 10+ years. I make sure to practice proper hygiene.   
She is in great health and people often ask me if she's still a puppy.

Please do your own research."
aww,fejsyym,t3_epjbyk,1579185096.0,Marley?
aww,fejsrwz,t3_epjf71,1579184957.0,Fät.
Whatcouldgowrong,fejrni2,t3_epjk60,1579184143.0,He’s lucky to have escaped that unscathed.
bayarea,feiuyru,t3_ep60if,1579147916.0,Damn it. Why didn’t I think to not pay the red light fine when I could’ve gotten away with it. Kicking myself.
newhampshire,feimxqf,t1_feigklg,1579142285.0,The place we moved into was already equipped with k1 kerosene oil heaters so we are using them. They do a pretty good job of heating the entire house.
