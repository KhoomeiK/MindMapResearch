scifiwriting,fdetc87,t1_fdereh4,1578346178.0,"In reality, I think that like humans they would come to recognize the intrinsic value in each other and, since they wouldn't have anything physical to serve as an enabler for tribalism like skin or ancestry, probably more naturally tend towards good old-fashioned getting along. Additionally, and I haven't thought about this before, the resources they would fight for would be computational. Instead of land, water, oil, or minerals they would compete for internet bandwidth allocation and computational resources. Some AI would also be disparately inferior in intelligence. For example, countries like America and China would continue to be leaders in this space. So a Chinese or American AI, even with the same exact software, would be ""smarter"" because its brain would just be bigger. However, that sort of an eventuality - standardized AI software packages from different entities being scalable according to end-user needs - would also mean that many hobbyists could also run their own AI. This is something we see today with hobbyist compute clusters; if we reach a point where ""real AI"" is just something somebody who's merely fairly wealthy can get, we could be seeing all sorts of things happen. Because centrally-run AI groups would be rather homogeneous internally, but single AI, potentially cutoff from the internet for varying periods of time, might develop very different and unique personalities according to their human user. Idk, this is just kind of train of thought speculation about this stuff. I'm really excited to see where this all goes, especially once memristors or something similar allow very organic-like physical neural nets to host these brains."

What kind(s) of government are the rebels fighting for, are there competing factions? How does the system destroyer work? What are the rules for the magic? Spaceships, space battles, laser guns, majority being poor... these are all so generic and inherent that worrying about them is frankly kind of stupid. I get that you don't want to be a copycat but spaceships are inherent to spacefaring; battles are inevitable in any space, air, or sea; and lasers are just such a common idea (also blasters in Star Wars are plasma weapons not lasers.)

**TLDR** my advice is to focus on the questions I asked above, figure out more questions to ask along those lines, and keep answering until you have something that's representative of your creativity and your ideas. You can do this, you just need the patience to sit down and question and question and question until you're sick of it, then question some more. Curiosity is the beginning of creativity."

Elephants on the other hand have slower metabolisms and live longer. It has to do with reproduction errors. The faster you reproduce cells the more likely you are to get errors in a given period of time you're measuring. So like, take me for another example, I've always had a fast metabolism and heal pretty quickly, but it's coming at a cost in that things are already starting to kind of slow down. So a species who could regenerate extremely rapidly would likely see some point at which statistically their bodies just rapidly break down and they die quickly.
