Bill loaned Bob a rather expensive collectible item to be used as a bit of background in a photo.  Bob used the item and then gave ito as a gift to someone who admired it during the specific use.  Bill had absolutely not given Bob permission to give away the collectible and, in fact, had a rather extensive collection of his own with this as a prized centerpiece of the display in his home of said collection.  Luckily for Bill, he had not only records of the purchase but details photos of the item including two very minor condition issues which served to be sufficiently unique so as to identify it.

After the ""Bob knows nothing of any loan of an item form Bill"" argument failed miserably due to an email from Bob requesting the loan of the item surfaced, the defense argued as you have, that the intent was simply unclear criminally.  The judge's instructions to us as a jury were that giving the property to another as a gift absolutely counted as intent for the purposes of the statute.  One simply does not gift something to another that they don't intend as a permanent gift!

I see no difference between that instance and the facts at hand in this post.  The only difference I can see is there's some paperwork which may make it a more solid case!

One does not surrender a dog to a shelter claiming one owns the dog unless one *intends* that to be a permanent thing.  When one knows the dog is owned by one's roomie, the intent is ***clearly*** to permanently deprive the roomie of the dog.  In fact, if the jerk who surrendered the dog had simply said, ""my roomie is out of town and my circumstances have suddenly changed but I can't leave a dog alone in a house"", the shelter surely would have cared for the dog while trying to contact the owner.

An 18 month old should generally be getting 14 hours sleep out of every 24.  Obviously that's not going to happen all the time but that's the recommendation for that age.  So, yeah, a majority should overlap but there's still quite a bit where it wouldn't.

> Listen, I get that every kid and every family is different. And parenting is hard is fuck so I'm not here to judge. I'm just finding it hard to make the math work given all the needs that go into making a family and household work. For me personally if I'm doing the bare minimum (cooking/dishwashing/showering) outside of child-maintenance I can only get in 3-4 hours in one day, max.

That's where it comes down to every family is different, though.  I'm able to get in 12 hours a day with ease, personally, and have been since my kids were much younger.  A good chunk of that is because I'm self employed and my work is sporadic.  So there will be days where I don't work atr all and others where I don't have time to game at all.  Add in a disability which severely restricts my mobility and 12 hours really isn't all that uncommon for me even when I've had to feed the family, clean the kitchen, do the vacuuming, shower, and do laundry.  Heck, a good chunk of dishes and laundry is set it and walk away, for that matter.

My wife's also disabled and while she contributes somewhat, it isn't much at all in the last 2 years for various medical reasons.  There are days where her gaming time exceeds my own significantly.  Not because she's lazy but because she overdid it the day before and has to recover.

Keep in mind a kid at 18 months is probably sleeping for 11 or 12 hours at a shot with another nap or two for another 2 - 3 hours.  Even if /u/Amorphica gets 8 hours of sleep but otherwise plays games when the kiddo's sleeping that leaves half of the 12 hours open right there.  There's absolutely no reason a toddler at 18 months old can't play by themselves, with reasonable (but not helicopter-y) supervision for another 6 hours a day.

Kids do not need constant supervision, despite what so many will tell you nowadays.  In fact according to child development experts, which my wife is, children *need* independent play or they won't develop coping skills for minor difficulties.  Ever seen a 9 year old frustrated they can't do something the first time?  That's the sort of thing that develops if you don't let kids learn to be somewhat autonomous.

There can be legitimate concerns about visual development but we don't have hard numbers on that yet, which is why the limits seem so low compared to older kids and adults.

Once the kids get older it's important to recognize a huge amount of socialization now happens purely online.  My 16yo, for example, can spend several hours a day playing games with his school friends.  That's on top of hanging out in person for several hours doing stuff like badminton or the like.

A lot of folks complain about that amount of time spent online but keep in mind this replaces the old phone call time we'd spend in earlier generations.  Nobody used to blink at a kid spending 5 hours a day on the phone, assuming nobody else in the house needed ity.  Heck, there'd often be separate lines because of that!  There is little functional difference except they're usually doing some sort of goal oriented task these days as well as just chatting.

To be clear, she said the original post describes a situation she'd likely have been compelled to report as abuse if she knew you all personally.  It was really that egregious.

First, and foremost, your wife is unqualified to be adding worksheets for the kids even if it weren't age inappropriate, which it most definitely is at 7 and 9.  If the school is giving them homework, that's plenty.

Continue with the family therapy and supplement it with a parenting class.  Also consider a separate therapist for the kids.  They haven't been able to develop their own communication tools properly so they're almost certainly in need of some help there.

Then, once things settle down and are stable to the point where your therapy team feels adding activity wouldn't be harmful on its own (there's almost certainly some trauma from this which will need to be worked through) a maximum of two activities per child is considered acceptable.  Not two per day, two per *week*.  Even two per week would be marginally excessive for the norm, mind you.

I also ended up not on a second date, let alone anything long term, with someone whose dietary preferences were in such conflict with my own they were unsustainable for the long haul.

Yet both those things (religious and diet) are things I managed to work out fine with others.  By way of example, while I am not Christian, my wife is Catholic and it doesn't cause issues in our relationship.  Similarly the dietary requirements of my family aren't quite in line with my own due to food allergies yet I managed to make accommodations which have led to a successful relationship.

Knowing now what I discovered then, I would *absolutely* know I'm simply incompatible with someone who objects to even cooking their food in the same kitchen as I do mine because I eat meat and she doesn't.  I also wouldn't likely bother dating someone in certain sects of Christianity because I've found ladies who belong to them simply not to be suitable for me nor I them in the long term.

I'm not overly worried about grime or anything, as anyone who sees my home could attest, but holy crap is that just one of the most disgusting things I've seen yet as a public ""monument"" or the like."
badwomensanatomy,ff56288,t1_ff4zk2c,1579581257.0,"As someone who grew up at a beach, that line pisses me off.  Not because it's untrue but because it made me identify with a whiny fuckwit of a character for a moment."

MadeMeSmile,ff4yk3n,t1_ff4wgby,1579575547.0,"> The most likely explanation is that the vet was pretending to be puzzled rather than explain that your cat is actually stressed.

That'd be my guess as well.  I opted not to pursue veterinary school years back after a volunteer steint at a shelter showed me I couldn't handle the emotional downsides well.  Regardless, one of the things a vet told me when asking for advice was to a successful veterinarian always pays as much attention to the needs of the humans as the animals while still putting the needs of the animal first."
ChoosingBeggars,ff4x1bb,t1_ff4jjzq,1579574491.0,"Depends on the city too, in fact.  Seattle passed stronger worker protections than Washington State's a while back now.  You'd have thought the sky would fall to hear business's response to it.  The crazy thing is doing things right results in happy workers and amazing productivity, IME.  My current business doesn't need any but when I had employees I always made sure to pay attention to worker needs on scheduling, among other things.  My employees **loved** that job and it was just a shitty retail/warehouse thing.

Edit: on the city, not in the city.  LOL"

Hunting is a lot of fun.  I have nearly as much fun seeing scenery and doing stranger events on the way there as anything else.  :)"

WAlitics,ff1hguj,t1_ff1gn6v,1579479293.0,I'm well aware but others have said essentially the same thing unironically.  I figured it was worth pointing out to lurkers that it's not a reasonable assumption to make.
AndroidTV,ff1gbox,t3_eqyswv,1579478777.0,"I've used mine for over a year now.  I was initially concerned about the lack of Ethernet but have been pleasantly surprised to find it a non-issue for us.  My router's rather close to the TV, however, so YMMV as is always the case with WiFi.

I've not had major issues with mine.  The worst that happened is now and again early on it decided it wanted to pair the remote again.  That's only happened 3 or 4 times in the last year so not a huge issue.  I paid about $40 for mine here in the US and feel that was a heck of a deal."
WAlitics,ff1e21b,t1_ff01p56,1579477999.0,"> we know he can't afford a new office chair.

No, we don't.  We only know he didn't want to pay for one.  When I did security consulting some years back there was a write up from a retailer of luxury goods and clothing I read which said something like 60% of shoplifters had cash in their pocket sufficient to pay for the thing they tried to steal.  While I agree that doesn't *necessarily* mean that wasn't cash they needed for rent or the like, it's still a heck of an enlightening statistic, especially considering the store's target audience."
bestoflegaladvice,fexfoio,t1_fexe54d,1579430224.0,"Oh, I don't know.  I think there's a reasonable basis for making that assumption in most cases.  It does seem to have gone a little far, to be sure, but in most cases why would you pay on a loan if you don't believe you owe the money?"
bestoflegaladvice,fex6h5q,t1_few2c4f,1579425324.0,"If it isn't liquid, it isn't cash.  It might be in a CD they can't cash in at short notice on a holiday weekend, I suppose, but if it's in any sort of normal account, they should be able to access it."
