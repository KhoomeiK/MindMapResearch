I do think it's worth mentioning that there are many people who are bright and high 'achievers' but dont have great social skills/relations and who aren't necessarily happy on the inside but channel their time and vast energy into intense pursuits/work/training that give them psychological relief by allowing them to forget themselves and any life problems by focusing on work (ie ""workaholics""). I would consider this dysfunctional but others who highly value great wealth or fame or prestige might think ""good for them"" (true) but not know the full picture as to what's driving this achievement.  personally I think a balance is healthy;  if there's no time for family (see OP picture, trust me that guy has NO family time) I see an unhealthy person. No time for unstructured thinking/ dreaming? unhealthy imho. Anyway besides the fact that this guy's careers are done out of service to country etc since they actually are not getting wealthy at those jobs btw, I see major red flags in the over-the-top adrenaline focus time commitment required.  like someone running away from themself who is also bright and talented.
