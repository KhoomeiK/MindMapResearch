offmychest,ffxpqh9,t3_evq1mc,1580329987.0,I’m really sorry for your loss. I hope you are able to find comfort in friends and other family. It takes a long time to get through losing someone and honestly there is no such thing as getting over it. No one can replace your parents. You just kind of learn to live with it and create new support systems.
offmychest,ffxpi3w,t3_evrjx0,1580329854.0,Please end this toxic relationship. This is way beyond her just being pretty. She is using you. Not saying there is anything wrong with playing the dating game (wing man/woman) but putting you in danger physically and emotionally is NOT normal.

If you want a healthy marriage and sex life keep the communication lines open in a positive way, go on dates, do nice things for her, be a team. Women connect through emotional attachment, keep treating her like you’re best friends.

Don’t allow whoever your ex-girlfriend was to rob you of a healthy marriage. The ex cheated on you, don’t punish your wife for it.

From the day you get married to the day you divorce, everything you guys acquire is community property. 

It depends on the state you live in but if you were to, for example, get married and get a divorce a year from now. The court would still consider whatever you had before marriage as separate property."

I was afraid to vent about anything in my life to my sister. Like sisters do. I thought, She had cancer, what do I have to be complaining about? I was having a horrible day and when I opened up to her about it, she thanked me. She said none of her conversations felt real anymore. Everyone was trying to be sensitive to what she was going through but they were actually just alienating her from feeling normal.

I work in the legal field (specifically family law and domestic violence) and I have seen non-abusive parents lose their children for failing to protect them. This is really serious. While she didn’t physically harm him, Emotional abuse is equally damaging. The fact that you are not surprised by her outburst and even refer to her rage as “she has always been like this”... it says A LOT about the situation. 

Please get some counseling, get out, and file for custody of your son. She should be supervised around him unless you are 100% certain she wouldn’t harm him emotionally or physically. 

It is horribly sad that most men are not validated when they are being abused and I wish so much this stigma didn’t exist.
