I know the term “red flag” gets thrown around here a lot, but it’s really scary that your current husband thinks his grown daughter is entitled to a dime of your late daughter’s money. That’s some kind of sick rationale, and it almost makes him more of an AH than your step-daughter, because he should know better. But clearly the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree: beware. I’m sorry for your loss."

AmItheAsshole,fe67i4b,t3_ensbqt,1578883524.0,"NTA Spencer is old enough, and has been in the Deaf community long enough to make his own decisions about it at this point. It sounds to me from what little you’ve shared with us like he understands the big issues in the community, and he’s made a mature decision based on his experiences with them. 

Nothing he’s doing right now is a permanent decision; I would guess he can transfer back to a Deaf/HoH school if he wants to, and he’s not going to marry this girl he’s interested in now. Almost every experience in life can be learned from, so I really don’t see the problem."

AmItheAsshole,fe5h2oy,t3_eno5q8,1578869372.0,"NTA Um, what? No, seriously. What? What kind of pill? A SEX pill?? WTH, man? I’m a big girl, and yes...I have sex...what’s your point, dude? Would you rather I get pregnant and get an abortion? Just curious. LMAO. You should have asked him and made him even more uncomfortable. It would have been hilarious."
