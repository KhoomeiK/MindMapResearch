Because this is a place to learn about a wide variety of things, not just one. So if you see someone giving bad/situational/partial advice on something you're already knowledgeable about, you should try to help the people here that are also trying to learn, but aren't yet knowledgeable. In many cases, people are just instantly sharing an image guide that they found elsewhere & didn't create or check into before posting. I don't think that's the case here, just to be clear though.

The roll technique here is stated to prevent wrinkles, when in fact it's one of the worst options for creating wrinkles. Even if you do a single hard fold (thought of as a bad option), you only deal with a single line wrinkle that you can easily get out at any hotel with the complimentary iron & board/steamer. A hanging luggage bag is even better, which is why I recommended it. The posted option is literally the worst solution I'm aware of for wrinkles.

If we as a planet truly wanted to make a huge impact until we can reverse climate change damage without spending many resources, there would be a 1 child limit going forward & abortions would be universally legalized to reduce unwanted pregnancies. If people still want more than 1 child, there could be a large carbon tax to offset the damage from the kid or adoption of existing children uses what already exists.

Gaming4Gamers,fdsx3i9,t3_emz7cc,1578709069.0,"Without an idea of what your price range is, I can only give this advice: Avoid gaming chairs like the plague. 

What you want is a quality office chair with ergonomics & all sorts of adjustments to customize how it supports you. They are designed for people to sit comfortably for 8-10 hours daily for years without having it impact their health. Gaming chairs are designed to look cool at all cost, so they can charge more for a lesser chair.

If you are a larger gamer, you can even get office chairs in ""big & tall"" designs that will be spacious & hold up for a decade of use.

If you live in an area with a surplus dealer, you can even get your hands on the really expensive office chairs for half price or less just because a business relocated or ended their equipment rental contract. Look for Herman Miller stuff. It's top quality."
