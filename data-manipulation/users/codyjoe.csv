conspiracy,ff8s3i2,t3_es5s1v,1579693899.0,Hillary is why so many of us went Trump. I was a bernie supporter to begin with in 2015-16 but once he was out I went for Trump. Hillary works for corporate America.

todayilearned,fejgrdq,t1_feiss60,1579173499.0,TIL there is actually only one functional one left and its being used by the last person who needs one. He has a hard time finding parts for it too. (Hes old he could be dead by now but he was alive last I heard)

I don’t think I would with someone I truly loved, but maybe thats because I understand what true love is, true love is when you love someone no matter what.....Eva Braun stayed with the most vile and evil man in the world because she loved him she looked past the other things which I think we all do if we truly love the person."

todayilearned,fcsr1u4,t1_fcrdcrk,1577922941.0,Moral knights on their high horses out in force. You know most the time the police end up keeping it. Especially if its large sums like suitcases full of cash.
todayilearned,fcrdcrk,t1_fcqn69o,1577900311.0,I have always wondered why people turn money in that has no connection to a person. Because turning into the police is not something id do with it....even when I was little I knew “keep your mouth shut” when you find money or win money either way its better to just keep it to yourself.

technology,fcpkmlk,t1_fcjylyc,1577866411.0,Yes like the ones that allowed the banks to get a several billion dollar bailout? That half of which went to the ceo’s in bonuses. Laws are not made to protect the people their made to protect the corporations dont be silly.
todayilearned,fckys6k,t3_egs3na,1577736090.0,"I almost jumped off that bridge......it was a hard time in my life and I was feeling pretty worthless and honestly its beautiful scenery, its a better way to go out than a gun or other means in which your family or friends will find your body. Most bodies are never found after they jump from the bridge."
todayilearned,fckxw59,t3_egsy12,1577735545.0,"My dad found a baby bunny that had been abandoned by its mom while mowing, i had it for about a week till i let it out to run around one day and my dog thought it was a toy killed it in one bite.

todayilearned,fckwhgv,t1_fcar09i,1577734691.0,Yeah but we have Geiger counters now. I think their more effective then a glowing cat that would probably die after a few times being “exposed”
todayilearned,fckw2iw,t3_egx77r,1577734435.0,"As far as I know (i could be wrong its been a long time since I seen a kids bop commercial) but they only use songs that are already popular, kinda like now only they have children sing the songs also normally toning down vulgar lyrics to make rap songs more kid friendly.  But they don’t create their own content that I know of any success it has are only due to the success of the songs they covered."

todayilearned,fckv8lp,t1_fcd3ru9,1577733924.0,"“Putting to sleep” I have never liked that term, the first time I heard it when I was small thought it meant just that the dog was going to the vet because it needed sleep or something, well the dog never came home. A sad way to find out the dog wasn’t “put to sleep”! I think the word euthanasia is better, or just saying ending its suffering."

todayilearned,fcjzwx3,t1_fchf5ll,1577712124.0,Realistically another country like Russia or China could also release an EMP which would have much the same effect only there would be no warning. Probably something more to worry about. Although I feel like this would still kill many people even with warning lots of people have pacemakers.

todayilearned,fcjzk15,t3_ehay4b,1577711740.0,Eventually they will just fence it in and give tours to future generations because it will probably be the only nature tract thats left open space and nature is becoming less and less as population grows.
politics,fcjxgzh,t3_ehbo63,1577709320.0,Where was Snowden’s protection? This is fake news as whistleblower protections only apply in corporate matters not political. Especially does not protect a whistleblower thats committed treason.
movies,fcjw81i,t3_eh8vv5,1577707736.0,Cats is to big to fail! We need to bail them out! Maybe congress will decide to give them a few truckloads filled with pallets of our hard earned tax dollars. (Just as smart as bailing out the banks who in turn took half the money and gave it to the CEO’s in bonuses)
technology,fcjw3qh,t3_ehewfm,1577707578.0,Yes we need more laws in the land of the “free” we need the government to tell us what to do like our mommies and daddies.

gatekeeping,fbrhy94,t1_fbrf98k,1577043053.0,"lol unless they have a neckbeard and play video games......you only want to build friendships with attractive guys. The funny thing about this, and women. I also have female friends (that I dont sleep with and dont want to) they are not attractive but guess what im still friends with them maybe they have intentions idk but i still stay friends with them regardless of their looks thats what real friendship is. Not being friends with some guy cuz he is attractive or rich which is why most women choose to have lots of “guy friends”"
