piercing,ff8yp59,t3_es8xso,1579700286.0,"I'm 39, and have had various facial piercings over the last 20 years or so.  Mostly my dad thinks they're cute.

My mom has always disliked them, but after awhile either just learned to ignore them or just didn't notice them.  When I got my nose re-pierced after having been face-hole-free for years, she didn't even notice, i had to point it out.  I've had my ears stretched to a 2g after having a 4g for probably 3 years, and she just noticed those the other day.

I got my septum done about two weeks ago, and she WILL notice that, and she'll hate it, but she also hated my Rosie the Riveter tattoo when I got it, and now if she can see it she'll squeeze the mouth on it and make her talk, so you never know."
CICO,ff8y10c,t3_es5lgw,1579699735.0,"I like cronometer for tracking, but there are lots of different apps that can help.

A food scale is really useful, you can get them pretty cheap.  It can be overwhelming at first if you've never done it, so you have to look everything up, but it gets easy after a few weeks once you're used to it!"
fatlogic,fekapgp,t1_fek2uhb,1579196115.0,"Exactly!  I do laundry, and all our clothes are clean, then suddenly a few days later I have piles of dirty clothes again.  Clearly, the answer is just not doing laundry at all."
piercing,feiiv8a,t3_ep8dm0,1579139550.0,"I got mine done a week ago, and for me I'd say it was actually, literally painless.  I felt the needle go through, and it was an odd sensation, but not pain.  The piercer said my eyes would water, but I didn't even get that.  My nostril was definitely more painful, and stepping on a lego is significantly worse!

As for pain after, I had a tiny bit of soreness later that day and after that only some stinging if I happened to bop it on something, or forgot about it and rubbed my nose.

She showed me how to flip it up before I left the shop.  I flip it up for sleeping so it doesn't get moved around in my sleep, but leave it down the rest of the time."
fatlogic,feac9r3,t3_en8h4h,1578946915.0,"I just found out there's a kickboxing gym 15 minutes from my house!  It didn't come up when I was trying to google gyms in the area, I found out about it from a recent post in the progress pics subreddit, the OP mentioned the gym she goes to and it sounded cool so I looked it up and there's one local!

One big plus for me is that the ""classes"" are run in circuits that start every three minutes, so I don't have to be there for a specific class time.  It's great for me because I like the structure of having classes/group workouts, but my schedule can be a bit unpredictable so I end up not being able to go to regular classes, I just end up missing them."
fatlogic,feaaf6n,t1_fe5d9r8,1578946267.0,"My mom had that done, she too snored like a bear with a headcold but also had sleep apnea.  She said it was incredibly painful, and if she had to do it over she wouldn't have done it.  She still snores, too.  Not as loud as she did before she had it, but it didn't fix the problem completely either."
fatlogic,fdrq1k1,t1_fdqnbqq,1578688025.0,"Help Vampires!  Never heard that before, it's great.  There are always tons of those on weight loss subs/message boards.  Years ago, when Weight Watchers still had message boards, they were everywhere.  The type that couldn't eat a snack without asking a question about it, they wanted answers but never wanted to be told how to find the answers for themselves.  And if you tried to show them how to help themselves, you were ""mean""."
fatlogic,fdrpkr9,t1_fdqo933,1578687762.0,"People who compulsively lie like this never seem to actually be able to make any of their lies believable.  They'll make up a degree, but not in anything they're actually knowledgeable about.  They run the fastest (but they can't show you, for reasons), they eat the least but are still overweight, they parent the hardest but couldn't tell you what grade their kids are in."
fatlogic,fdrilly,t3_ems7pb,1578685085.0,"I gained about 3 lbs over the course of the holidays, so I'm annoyed at myself.  I'm also laughing at myself a bit, because I always used to internally roll my eyes at someone saying ""OMG, 3 lbs!"" when I was overweight (which was most of my life).  I finally understand it!  I'm 5'4"" and in the healthy weight range, 3 lbs is the difference between tight pants and pants that fit well, or feeling comfortable in a fitted t-shirt.  I can feel the difference!  On the rave side of things, I'm thin enough that 3 lbs makes a noticeable difference to me.

Well, back on the wagon.  I'm now trying to decide if I want to join a gym or make myself a program to do at home.  A gym is money, and takes more time since I have to go there, but I also find it hard to get motivated to work out at home."
fatlogic,fdkgfiu,t3_ekgr6e,1578503337.0,"Why not both?  ONE reason I work out is because I like how it makes me look, and my husband certainly appreciates it, and frankly I've noticed a few random strangers checking me out, which feels weird because I'm a near-40 year old mom.

But, I also work out because I like how it makes me feel.  I have more energy for my active job, so I can lift and climb things without asking for help.  And when my toddler yells ""run wiff me!"", which she's been doing every day after dinner lately, I can chase her around the house for as long as she wants, sometimes with my 60-lb 9 year old on my back."

fatlogic,fcv61mz,t3_eizw2r,1577995384.0,"The times when I'm too busy to exercise (just coming off a few 80 hour work weeks, done with that for now, though!), I realize just how much it helps me, both mentally and physically.  When I work out, I have more energy, I'm calmer, less anxious, and happier in general.

But yeah, thanks for hoping I'll stop exercising, just because you don't like it.  You're basically wishing worse mental health on me.  Appreciate it, really!

Also, it takes like 5 minutes to count calories, and at this point I don't even bother every day."
gallbladders,fcq3iys,t3_eifyyq,1577877941.0,"Sounds exactly like my first gallbladder attack, including the pain of course subsiding the second the ambulance arrived only to start back up again in the ambulance.  They didn't diagnose it as gallbladder at the time, they were looking for something in my lungs/chest/heart area, but I had another attack a month or so later and the doctor found what he called ""piles of stones"" in my gallbladder on the ultrasound.

You might have had a stone/stones that passed and that's why there were no stones by the time they did they ultrasound."
fatlogic,fc72ijs,t1_fc0p1eo,1577495801.0,"Yeah, I wear a 32D and buy pretty much exclusively online, I don't remember the last time I got a bra in person.

Even if a store has bands that go below a 34, they're never above a B cup at that band size.  The D cups mostly start at a 38 band at best."
fatlogic,fc6wvvj,t1_fc5g6pi,1577491577.0,"We had a cat we nicknamed Starvin’ Marvin.  He was diabetic and lived at the vet before we adopted him, and they said he’d drown out the dogs in the morning yowling for his breakfast.  He’d steal anything, including hot peppers and the rind to a quarter pound of brie cheese.  With the peppers, he kept picking them up, putting them down, and yelling at me because he knew they were good but didn’t understand why he didn’t like them.

After we got him, he remained diabetic but we got his insulin down to about a tenth of what it was when we got him because we kept his diet really controlled.  Except for the snack thievery."

fatlogic,fbnoh0e,t3_edvvsl,1577000874.0,"After a rough day of 11 hours on my feet at work, after which my car (which I just had fixed last week) broke down so my husband had to come get me, we stopped and got Wendy's on the way home instead of cooking.

Was it tasty?  Yes.  Did it make me feel good?  Yes, I was hungry and I also didn't have to clean up after cooking a meal just in time to go back to bed and do it all again today.

But that doesn't make it good for me, or something I should do often.  I don't regret it, but I'm not doing it again today, either."
