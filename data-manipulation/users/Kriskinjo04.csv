AskReddit,ff7x58p,t3_ergjyj,1579660457.0,"I was manning the fitting room on a particular mundane Tuesday when this lady came in.

Obviously she seemed rather exhausted and upset as she had a baby (probably 6/7 months), toddler, a 5/6 year old and this very elderly lady who didn’t seem all there.

She had a bunch of dark dress clothes to try on and looked ten seconds from crying as the baby started to fuss and the elderly lady she was with was talking and trying to walk off in a random direction.

Turns out she’s a recently widowed wife of a marine. 
The elderly lady she’s with is her husbands mom who suffers from Alzheimer's and doesn’t realize her son is dead.
I doubt if even the kids know he’s dead but here she is, trying to hold it together and find them funeral clothes.

I feel for her and because the women’s handicap room is occupied and the men’s fitting room is empty I let her take her family into the men’s handicap room so she can keep MIL from wandering off and the kids in sight.


She’s short so it’s not like she can see or be seen on the men’s side and the door for the handicap room is extra tall/wide.

I let her know if she needs help zipping up a dress or tag teaming the kids I’m happy to help and she seems somewhat relieved before closing/locking the door.

Not even 2 minutes in the Asshole appears.
Dresses like he’s trying to convince people he’s Important (tm) and deserves Respect (tm) at all times.
Like Veron Dursley but younger.

This guy is well over 6ft, fat and just looks like the kind of guy that would loudly complain about his waitress not laughing at his gross ass attempts at flirtation and then not tip her despite her excellent service.

He had 5 items and was a dick when I asked him how many items he had.

“Why do you have to ask?! I’m not a shoplifter! Can’t you use your eyes and *SEE*?!”

He grabs his number and finds a room.
It’s not until one of the kids squeal, as kids will do, in the handicap room that Asshole starts to complain.

“Why are there KIDS on the MENS fitting room?!”

Then he hears the mom scolding them to stay quiet and then at her MIL for trying to jiggle the door handle.

“ A *WOMAN*!? THERES A WOMAN IN THE MENS FITTING ROOM!?”

His bitch ass comes out half dressed to yell at me for letting a woman in the men’s fitting room and that how she could be peeping Tom.

Really.
That distraught petite 5ft widow with her 3 kids and elderly MIL would *definitely* check out your lard ass.
*REALLY*

So still half dressed and leaving all his shit on the floor of the room he looks for the one male associate on the floor, assumes he’s the store manager and all but herds him to the fitting room to “discipline” me for letting a woman and children into the men’s side.

“I shouldn’t have to hear women or children in the men’s fitting room!”

My male coworker was like, “you’d still hear them regardless of where you are” and that of course, pissed him off more and demanded corporate’s number.

He took down my name and my coworkers (still assuming he was the manager because he was a dude) and vowed to get us fired.

He still leaves everything on the floor of the fitting room and is still not properly dressed in our store.

Cue the widow coming out of the in literal tears and saying how sorry she is about all this.

She ends up slumped on the fitting room floor in tears while the 5/6 year old is is messing with the baby, toddler is screaming and the MIL is now trying to remove her dress and touch the fitting room mirror.

I do my best to console her and tell my coworker to get the actual manager.

My manager assures her neither of us will lose our jobs and Asshole is just a prick.
She says if you want to be sure tho just leave us your contact info and a statement and we’ll send it to corporate before he can even call.

It took us another 30 minutes of comforting her in the men’s handicap room which again, was devoid of men for the foreseeable rest of the night, we helped her pick out the dress clothes most likely to fit the kids/MIL without trying them on, gave her a discount on her total for her troubles and helped her get the kids/MIL to the van with her purchases.

I sadly never saw her again but the Asshole *did* make a call to corporate and despite the evidence indicating that there was no way that she could have looked at him it was ruled that we could no longer under any circumstances have the opposite gender in the fitting rooms.

And the Asshole did come back.
He was always snotty as fuck asking me if I let any peeping women in the men’s room again and “not to eye him” when I cleared the fitting rooms of debris.

I hated him so damn much because now people who did need their partners help to dress because of an apparatus in their chest or being wheelchair bound were forced to either settle on a strangers help (me) or suffer by themselves.

If I met that fucker in the streets today I would take great pleasure in telling him off for what he did to that poor woman and if I could get away with it break his legs."

4. Go to Comic Con or your states version of it. Why? Because cool people go there and it’s fun
5. Don’t lead/enter reeking of desperation
6. Learn to read social cues and if you can’t register them get a wingman
7. Take things casual (aka don’t start planning how many kids you’re going to have in 2.5 years)
8. Just be yourself because no one on Gods green earth expects you to be a prefect specimen of the human race and we all have flaws
9. Also pet a dog because petting dogs lowers stress and why wouldn’t you pet a dog?"

Generally speaking, you should call the cops every time so that way there’s a report proving this happened on [x] day with their customer but if you didn’t still take pictures because both insurance companies are going to want them.

Keep all receipts and paperwork from the doctor you saw. Let them know you’ve been in an accident so it will be documented and looked for in tests and keep calling her insurance company to push the case along.
