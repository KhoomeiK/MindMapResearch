It’s just when there are no cars in that lane, and people just hop in doing 40 MPH and drive down the entire length.

People using bike lanes on W Bayou as extra turning spacing when taking curves. People using bike lanes on Johnston to turn into S College. People using the turning lane as a personal highway to reach the light quicker, only to be stuck and not able to even turn when they get there.

PopCornTime,ff6ista,t1_ff6baqh,1579628104.0,"Look, I have no idea where I went hostile. Literally the only thing I can think that can be perceived as “hostile” is when I was trying to give you an idea of what I was clicking and dragging without having to post a photo. Maybe you took the “don’t know how familiar you are” comment in a different way than it was intended, if so my bad. I probably could have phrased it better. 

I also never said Popcorntime was broken. I said it wasn’t working for me, and was asking for help as to find out how or why it was occurring. I’m reading back through and I can’t pinpoint where you would get that idea. Maybe reading into things too much?

Let’s just squash this. I’ll apologize for calling you a dick. It’s just very irritating having someone tell you you don’t know how to copy paste or drag."

PopCornTime,ff6a8ce,t1_ff5tp66,1579622750.0,"I may have misread what it was specifically mentioning, to be honest, about the trackers. It was an older thread that came up when I searched here before posting.

I’m using PIA, which I believe uses TCP. I’m not home at the moment to check what port number. I did notice that when I switched to a different server (Denver-Houston), it seemed to resolve the torrent quicker on the first try. Is it possible it’s a problem with PIA?

Thanks for the help!"

PopCornTime,ff4rant,t1_ff4bkll,1579570551.0,"First of all, it’s not repetition. It’s just you being a dick, but I digress.


I’ve used Popcorntime for a long time. I’ve been using these sites, and torrenting for even longer. I’m aware of how these sites work. As for the pictures, I literally just grabbed two screen shots of a random torrent, not the exact ones I’m downloading. I’m running Adblock. There are no pop-ups. No re-directs. 

Hell, if you want to check it yourself, feel free to search for S1 Ep 4 of Titans. Last time I checked, it had around 400 seeders on the site. Give it a shot. 

Thanks for your effort.

Broaddus has a good onion ring, ya know? Solid batter, thicc, and with a good sauce.

Walk-ons has some damn good skinny shoe string ones, like Popeyes used to have. It’s good shit. 

Bloomin Onion? I think maybe only Outback has those, though I may be experimenting with them soon at my place."

Programs do experience faults, however, as is evidenced by the [multitudes](https://www.reddit.com/r/PopCornTime/comments/4ed9g6/issues_with_magnet_linking_in_beta_39/) of [trouble ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PopCornTime/comments/3y8m6s/magnet_links_stuck_at_resolving_and_movies_stuck/)shooting posts on this subreddit. 

I'm not sure why you only took half of my comment about their websites to quote. Did you bother reading it? It wasn't suggesting you are not familiar, it was giving you an idea of what I am trying to use. 

I'm sensing sort of a snarky attitude coming through your comments, so let's go ahead and chill out. Unless I am not seeing another icon to drag or copy, then this isn't user error. It takes multiple attempts to resolve before finally getting the video playing. Ive been able to get 2 episodes after about 8-10 tries each. That surely doesn't sound like user error."
PopCornTime,ff3lq3t,t1_ff1v9bg,1579543731.0,"I don’t believe so. It used to work all the time. I’m not sure how familiar you are with the KAT or 1337x website layout, but essentially what I would be grabbing is the magnet icon (which if you right click and copy gives you a magnet link address), which is right next to the main download torrent button

I managed to get a link to work from 1337x, but that was the only one thus far. Doing my research throughout this sub suggests that the trackers the links I am using may not be supported by popcorntime, so that may be something I’m doing wrong. 

I’ve gone ahead and installed at qtbitorrent jist in case I still have trouble.

Thank you for your help!"
