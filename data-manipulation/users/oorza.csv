My point was, it doesn't matter.  The differences between the tools these days are so minor as to not be relevant to everyone using them.  Sure there are faster ways to edit text in Vim than IDEA, but IDEA has better debugging/refactoring support.  At the end of the day, if your text editing/input speed has a measurable effect on your job performance, you should probably find a more mentally challenging job.  I spend much, much more of my time planning code, reading code, or reviewing code than I do writing or debugging code."
