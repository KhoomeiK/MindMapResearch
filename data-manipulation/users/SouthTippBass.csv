Theres loads of fun to be had until it just abruptly stops. At least Ground Zero was a finished product, even if it is only one small map. I had more fun replaying that one map over an over, completing every mission and unlocking everything than I had in PP.

So, to answer your question, if you didnt enjoy GZ, you probably wont enjoy PP. It's more of the same, with more toys, larger maps and an unfinished story."
