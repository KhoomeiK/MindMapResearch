smuggling,fgi818l,t1_ff2j3kb,1580810459.0,"Cruise security isn't super tight in my experience. If it's just personal, should be fine just having it in a backpack or luggage. If it's pills or something that can be put in a capsule like MDMA just put em in with regular meds in a sunday-saturday pill box. If it's something that might smell like weed or blow or something, then vacuum seal it, wash your hands, seal it again and then clean it in bleach, rubbing alcohol etc and hide it in your luggage like in a can safe or something. If it's alcohol or liquid, you can buy bladders on Amazon and other sites that are specifically made for smuggling booze onto cruise ships. I def don't own any tho, and Ive certainly never done any of these things, so I can't say that they've worked for me every single time. But I can say they've never failed me, since I've never tried."

The smallest government, after all, is an absolute monarchy. Feudalism allowed some checks and balances, but only for the benefit of nobility. Representative parliamentary systems made subversive collusion toward some exclusively beneficial endeavor much more difficult to accomplish quietly. So I say big government. Let's get oversight comittees for the oversight committees, and give em some teeth.

I was thinking the other day, I'm not sure anyone would be able to convince me that any person should be allowed to have a net worth higher than 1 billion dollars. 999 million? Fine. But there is no social or economic benefit to any one person hqving a net worth of over 1 billion. Not even really for that person either, but especially not for any of the 8 billion others. I'm disgusted by the idea of one person controlling tens or hundreds of billions of dollars. It's absolutely disgusting. It means your 5th yacht, or 9th fish tank, or your super small dick status is more important than literal human lives.

Institutions that function through a diverse framework of individuals, each one operating with their own unique interests, aspirations, morality, personality, financial stability, and so on.

The diffusion of responsibility among a collective, with people who might be more worried about a paycheck than giving a judge a what-for, just for the sake of their principles. The Holocaust happened - in part - because of that same diffusion of responsibility being weighed against the gravity of individual cost, allowing people to justify perverting or abandoning their moral principles under the logic that one Nazi refusing orders (or one young cop giving a citation to a judge) won't change anything, won't stop or even slow down any systemic injustice, but it very well may affect my paycheck, my future, my family... So why should I lose *my* paycheck, or fuck up *my* life, if it doesn't matter? 

Diffusion of responsibility, when weighed against one's personal cost, is a steep uphill battle. It's why problems become so deeply ingrained in the first place; tolerated by ppl who feel powerless because individually, they are. It applies to voting, or labor strikes, or a slave rebellion, the individual cost outweighs the chance of success, because success requires organized collective action, as well as trust in your compatriots that they will also follow thru and not succumb to the complacent and familiar safety of an inadequate status quo"
