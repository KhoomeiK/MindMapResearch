leagueoflegends,ffpsisn,t1_ffp8yai,1580104112.0,"you don't buy any of those three items as a midlane mage first back against AD assassins. You buy seeker's, take barrier, and then watch them cry."
leagueoflegends,ffpqerr,t1_ffocw7g,1580102082.0,Dude he just didn't push any advantages at all. Didn't seem to be willing to take any fucking risks.
leagueoflegends,ffpqcud,t1_ffot5me,1580102034.0,"It was just kind of a shitshow all around. I can't believe bjerg left in that blue fight, and then he had to w back over again (of course doing no damage). Dardoch was playing his fucking soul out early on but TSM just didn't do anything with it."
leagueoflegends,ffpqam8,t1_ffogpxh,1580101975.0,yikes that is pretty true.
leagueoflegends,ffpkk4v,t1_ffp7omf,1580097291.0,Yeah i coulsnt remember the exact specifics its been a long time
leagueoflegends,ffp7elr,t1_ffoehtk,1580088098.0,True for ADCs since at least graves. Maybe stopping a hot minute for lucian

In short, get over yourself."
leagueoflegends,ffi2c0z,t1_ffhz9ci,1579963017.0,What you building on him bro? Ive spent the last few months grinding out Viktor. I am finding a kot of auccess eith Dun's build.
leagueoflegends,ffg5c0h,t1_fffz0l4,1579898788.0,"Good times dude. Suxking teams dick in champ select so the guy stuck playing support would pixk taric or leona and not int. ""When we get level 2 we go in immediately."" It was enough to get me to like 1700 elo playing those three champions."
leagueoflegends,ffg4z0l,t1_fffo40j,1579898567.0,They are going to sandbag this split. And by sandbag i mean just put little effort into it.
leagueoflegends,ffg1hxe,t1_ffdjj29,1579896420.0,Yo wtf why would you disrespect The General by omitting his title?
akalimains,fffzcmd,t1_ffez4ks,1579895102.0,"Oof brother I feel you. Flashing in for the teamfight ult (maybe with a Nunu empiring in a bush somewhere). The q was so satisfying to hit. They reworked a lot of my old champions. Graves, Poppy, Vlad (lesser), yorick, sion, Fiora, Xerath (though I quite like new xerath I must say)."

todayilearned,fejyb7y,t1_fejsgic,1579188617.0,"I don't think its the one thing standing between man and savagery, if that is what you are asking. It is more complex than that. But 6 is a group insomuch that it is a web of relationships tying them together. Once you get too many people that ceases to be the case."
AskReddit,fejs9b2,t1_feiw69r,1579184588.0,I think if you cant use a PC pc people look like wizards. What they dont know is we all learned by hitting buttons until the problem went away.
todayilearned,fejqp5s,t1_fejiste,1579183440.0,You are not wrong and yet 6 is very different from the number in Lord of the Flies
dndnext,feefm74,t1_fed9khj,1579032762.0,"I have played two original Oriental adventures campaigns. I have only played through one module however (i cant even remember the name but it had to deal with Rakastas, cousins to Rakshasas.) Compared to material in 1e I wouldn't suggest a party be a mix pf PHB and OA material. You could definitely party in either setting with any party of characters and have it work."

todayilearned,fe3jctw,t1_fe3g13d,1578849743.0,"In the article linked further up. I will admit though that I agree with you. Police probably shouldnt be allowed ""ruses."""
dndnext,fe3ctr8,t1_fe23m3f,1578848120.0,I sure do miss the concept of name level. Yoh could avoid this problem entirely with it.
Competitiveoverwatch,fe3bsn6,t1_fe05wz9,1578847876.0,You might end up with 5 orissas that dont have fortify though lmao.
leagueoflegends,fe0ewl7,t1_fe0dn9m,1578812189.0,Yeah. There might be some match ups for w second but i dont know.

leagueoflegends,fdx6710,t1_fdvgn4u,1578765698.0,It was nerfed but it ia still disgusting man. Your level 1/2 damage is disgusting and then you just shove and roam.

leagueoflegends,fdc66lc,t1_fdbsndx,1578267883.0,Nah bro i was going LC/hexcore/ludens into lichbane but i tried the double rod build that was posted in the Viktor guide awhile ago and honestly besides the fact that i had to adjust to not having ludens mana it doesn't really feel like it hinders me that much.
Stellaris,fdbriv4,t1_fdbawgv,1578260886.0,It wasnt even for a huge part od the company IIRC. Like 15% or something.
AskHistorians,fdbkw0a,t1_fdbkn3i,1578258351.0,Thank you sir.
AskHistorians,fdbjvfs,t1_fdbdp7k,1578258092.0,Is there anywhere i could find the notes of those notaries? That sounds morbidly fascinating.
Competitiveoverwatch,fdbi68k,t1_fdb96r5,1578257601.0,"I dont think that that metric has anything to do with the health of the league. For investors (and this is the primary concern) success is measured on RoI. So in this sense, hyper inflating the buy in prices actually _negatively_ impacts the ""success"" of the league. There is almost no chance that anyone who bought into season 2 of the OWL is ever going to get their investment money back, much less turn a profit.

If you consider voicing these facts ""overly critical"" then I just do not know what to say."

leagueoflegends,fdb2qvw,t1_fdasz2t,1578253112.0,Yeah but you really dont need the mana anyways.
leagueoflegends,fdb2mvn,t1_fdakk01,1578253070.0,Ah. You know i have been playing for a long time so the fact that i have to do that doesnt even faze me even though you dont have to do it as much on other characters.
leagueoflegends,fdakaah,t1_fd9muck,1578246955.0,This is baffling to me. Do you just miss your lasers or something? What do you build?
leagueoflegends,fdak2yw,t1_fd5lg9d,1578246907.0,I have barely even noticed it even going dcap rush. If you want infinite mana why not go ludens.
leagueoflegends,fdah1ro,t1_fd812tf,1578246044.0,I just hit gold 1 and i think i am basically challenger.

leagueoflegends,fcxzzcj,t1_fcxyhon,1578072746.0,"Well that's what getting your shit wrecked in is for, learning what to do past ten minutes. It sounds like it would be a good experience for him."
leagueoflegends,fcxzkq6,t1_fcxzhjq,1578072660.0,"It might be a good experience for him, then, in that case. I bet dlift could teach him a lot about playing well with comms."
leagueoflegends,fcxxn41,t1_fcxw9pz,1578071937.0,I do not know much about him - do you think this wpuld happen with proven players like Doublelift or world champions Impact and corejj?
leagueoflegends,fcxwrrb,t3_ejg1kq,1578071619.0,"Not exactly - I have been playing and have played all of the champions enough to ""learn"" them. I took a break in 2016 to play overwatch though and only came back earlier of this year. I have played all the new champions but i havent touched rework poppy at all and have only played reworked sion once. There are a lot of champions that have gotten ""soft"" reworks that I havent played like Heimer, but I dont know if that counts since I played a lot of heimer back in the day."

AskReddit,fcxrlbc,t1_fcw5r83,1578069483.0,"The first Dune had my eyes glued to the page. It really doesnt waste any time before ""digging in"" to the story, if that makes sense."
politics,fcu354m,t3_ein079,1577971136.0,Yeah this is actually really difficult to figure out. What finally convinced me is that he hasn't said anything about living in a commune.
Competitiveoverwatch,fct7m2p,t1_fcsk6ti,1577935002.0,Yeah this game has nothing like listen loco.
asoiaf,fcr93dp,t1_fcqqe01,1577898555.0,"Like the other guy said, if you didnt like Mistborn i would still give Stormlight a try."
Competitiveoverwatch,fco5bka,t1_fco2144,1577824364.0,Yeah Im not saying Monte isn't partially responsible. But Riot definitely seemed biased against him after the payment ordeal.
Competitiveoverwatch,fco52rh,t1_fco36dl,1577824232.0,His business partner was a bad guy.
Competitiveoverwatch,fco4zuz,t1_fco35k1,1577824189.0,Yeah Ill agree to that. RIP.
Competitiveoverwatch,fcnzjop,t1_fcnucgd,1577821404.0,Ah they made him sell his team with no evidence and even announced publically that he had to sell it trashing the price. Real scumbag move.
askscience,fcnu3a7,t3_ei0z8c,1577818434.0,You should take this to /r/askhistorians instead.
