I’m currently recovering from anorexia nervosa and eating out makes me unbearably anxious because of the calories, I have to ask someone else to pick for me.

bulimia,fdztub1,t1_fdzg36t,1578795648.0,"we’re on the bulimia subreddit — binging followed by purging is extremely harmful which is why instead of encouraging people to eat, and therefore binge, we encourage normal eating patterns and enjoying in moderation. if OP eats all the chocolates, chances are they will feel the need to either eat more and then go purge, or just purge the chocolate. sorry this is long but yeah that really fucks up your body"
