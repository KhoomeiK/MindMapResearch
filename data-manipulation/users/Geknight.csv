BadCycling,feyc7zz,t1_fewlpk0,1579443629.0,"That part makes it look like the truck posted alongside the cyclist, then turned right in front of him.  Not the cyclists fault."
startrek,feploj1,t1_fep2wa9,1579323781.0,All of you are brilliant.
paralegal,fepkzhk,t1_fepgxp1,1579323247.0,"Fee earner, meaning you bill your time.  If you work more, then the firm earns more, meaning your ot is justified.  In any case, you should be paid for the time you work, even if you get approval afterwards."
paralegal,fepgvlj,t3_eqb422,1579320172.0,If you are a fee earner then overtime should be easier to get approved.
facepalm,feivhck,t1_feiug80,1579148321.0,r/iamverysmart and don’t get it.
facepalm,feiv4jz,t1_feir19q,1579148042.0,Gotcha.  Didn’t realize you were just stating your own realization.

or so I would like you to think..."
facepalm,feim3gw,t1_feikd3y,1579141725.0,And now the world knows my shame
facepalm,fehglmw,t1_fehghkp,1579116115.0,Done.

risa,fdt4998,t3_em3r9h,1578711714.0,Stonetoss is a nazi.
freefolk,fdqoc2w,t3_eml01k,1578671349.0,FUCK.  I got chills.
TheRightCantMeme,fdougea,t3_eme1r1,1578613138.0,"Yup, they are the only two."
BadCycling,fdobki2,t1_fdo9ych,1578602216.0,"You can’t tell from the video whether the bike or the truck reached the intersection first.  The truck could have come up behind the bike, or the bike could have come up along side the truck.  In either case, the bike is right by the truck’s mirror."
BadCycling,fdnnte3,t3_emcc7r,1578589632.0,How is this supposed to be bad cycling?  The guy is riding legally and the truck turns in front of him and literally runs him over.

startrek,fdkqxij,t1_fdkpvtv,1578509298.0,Got it.  I’m going to have to review all this before Picard comes out.
startrek,fdkp831,t3_elta9h,1578508283.0,"Wait, this article says that Romulus was destroyed... meaning they are merging the timelines?  What about all the times they mention and go to Romulus in TNG and DS9?"

PublicFreakout,fcunvn2,t1_fculjz7,1577984986.0,"Yeah, but shitty drivers are everywhere.  I ride my bike all over the city with no fear (just caution)"
PublicFreakout,fcuk98t,t1_fctdx79,1577982896.0,"Yes, but I find it really frustrating when people say they won’t even go to the city for whatever reason, then say they are from St. Louis.  I’m not trying to start anything and I know I’m getting downvoted, but the city has a lot of great stuff.  Come hang out with us and let’s have some fun, I promise you won’t be shot as soon as you are in the city limits."
PublicFreakout,fctbxum,t1_fcsv874,1577938501.0,So you don’t actually live in St. Louis then?
food,fckrnad,t3_ehmanl,1577731708.0,"There are at least 4 places in my city that say they have hot chicken, and none of them are even remotely spicy.  Such disappointment."
Civilization6,fbxti6e,t1_fbxdqg1,1577200092.0,"You need to use a builder to build a pasture on the horses.  Builders are needed to gain pretty much any resource, unless you build a city right on top of one."
