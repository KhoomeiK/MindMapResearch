Mordhau,ffgd2sz,t3_eteiwz,1579903551.0,That would be nice just a few hours ago I retreat back after a fight and had a teammate stab me right in the stomach with his spear. Honestly it was hilarious because he dadass looked at me and than decided to stab. I couldn't even be mad because full plate makes it quite hard as there isn't a lot of color other than a tiny bit on the gothic skirt.

shittyfoodporn,fe9ztpq,t1_fe9vom3,1578942935.0,"You need about 250ml of neutral oil, 4-5 dried chilies (I like Thai chilis but add whatever you want though fruitier sweeter chilies tend to work better), 3-4 garlic cloves lightly smashed and peeled and about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.

Heat everything on verry low heat in a small saucepan for about 20-30 minutes. The garlic shouldn't take any color while you are heating so really low heat. This is just to help with the extraction of flavors and make it shelf stable. Transfer too clean bottle/jar (whatever fits you pinterest/Instagram profile). Put in pantry or fridge and use over the course of 2-3 months to fry things in it or as topping. Use on fried rice, pizza, instant ramen, vegetables, meat,...

WTF,fe87vur,t1_fe85h9i,1578923564.0,Thanks for the insight that there. My native language is German and the German translation for heart attack (Herzinfarkt) explicitly means full or partial obstruction of coronary arteries. I have worked about 2 years as an EMT now and did a course on cardiovascular diseases like two weeks ago and never heard the German word used for something else. Good to know it can mean something else in English.
SwordOrSheath,fe83v87,t1_fe7i8ij,1578922222.0,Tell them a second person also said that
WTF,fe7xx91,t1_fe7tajx,1578920396.0,"Heart attacks aren't related to blood loss. Heart attacks happen when coronary arteries get partially or fully blocked by blood cloths, fat, cholesterol or other things which leads to parts of the heart not beeing supplied with oxygen. Injuries aren't really a cause for heart attacks, lifestyle, diet and genetics are the most contributing factors for heart attacks.

Edit: decided to add to this comment to make a few corrections other people pointed out as to not misinform with my comment. 
-Blood loss can cause a type of heart attack (I misstaded this due to a language barrier)
-heart attacks are mostly caused by stress or phisical exercises (even as little as pressing harder on the toilet) if contributing factors are met
-the type of heart attack I was referring to can also be caused by injuries due to stress and additional strain on the heart when loosing blood"

Second im glad that I seam to be doing some things right like listening to audio books on commutes and trying to learn new things. Also doing things that are different, like working as a volunteery EMT which is definitely new and exciting every day I do it. 

You are right it's crazy how quick things change and it just seams to get faster. Especially since I'm currently at university studding something technical. That field is definitely fast paced. I mean I can remember the time when landlines (though the wireless ones with a base station) were still around and people just started using the internet. Now that I'm basically at the source of new technology it's actually a bit scary. But I'm also happy that it's faster paced now, it seems like I will never run out things to learn and I hope this will keep me occupied enough so life never becomes just routine."

unpopularopinion,fcrxqau,t1_fcqzv54,1577908066.0,"Depends on how you are out with. I usually celabrate with friends who know how much they can drink, and nobody gets like black out drunk + all of them are nice, chill people and stay that way even when drunk.

Sure the American system sucks but there are systems that work and proof people can change. If justice would be the way some redditors promote we would basically be off a lot worse. Like medival chopping of hands torture worse. That doesn't do anything. If you aren't happy because you feel certain crimes should have harsher or longer punishments make an effort to change the law not scream murder. Also treating people as monsters because they did something bad will keep them monsters because what else could they do, treating them as humans however hard it may be because of what they did may actually make them humans and thy will realize their mistakes."
toastme,fcoqrf2,t3_ei4aw2,1577839050.0,Dude 15 days sober is awesome. Alcohol withdrawal is one of the worst (one of the only drugs where withdrawal can actually kill you). I can't even imagine how shitty you have felt the past two weeks and you are amazing for powering through that. That takes some serious dedication but once you started it just gets easier so keep on it. I have a feeling you are as badass as you look so you can do it. I also spend my first new years without drinking since I'm legally allowed to (just 5 years but yea) and I'm pretty much going to be awake for the next 4 h anyway since I spend it volunteering as an EMT so if you need anything just say something.
toastme,fcoqb3c,t1_fcomrn8,1577838719.0,Not defending alcohol per se but there are some that taste good. Maybe not the cheap ones you drink to get a buzz but I drink a good wine/ gin/ whisky/ beer definitely for the taste. Pure alcohol tastes like shit but in combination with other flavors it can be pleasant much in the same way if you ate a spoon full of ground nutmeg it doesn't taste good but it adds a nice flavor if used correctly. But to each their own
AskReddit,fcnipr9,t3_ehxmpw,1577812485.0,"Well rope bondage/ shibari. Did it a lot with my ex, a few other friends that were interested and sometimes on myself. Quite often not even in a sexual aspect. I see it more as building a sculpture with the human body. I love to think about new ties, how the ropes connect, where they settle on the body, how they react under tension and what the limitations of the body are. The challenge of visuaalizing all of that when designing them on paper. One time me and my ex even did a photoshoot with a friend of her which was a lot of fun, playing with lighting and some editing (mainly just lighting, contrast, color correction) to make the combination look the best. I find it super interesting and beautiful but still it isn't something you bring up at a family dinner even if you don't think about it in a sexual way."

Basically you get two or more temporary piercings (mostly on the shoulders, the skinny there is kinda loose and doesn't have as much nerve endings so it doesn't hurt as much) and get suspended by them using rope. The chance of the skin tearing is really low since it's actually quite strong. In the video you can see that the connection between the pully system and the rope connecting the hooks in his back broke rather than the actual skin. It has loose connections to a native American ritual called the sun dance.

Source: I'm weird as hell and fascinated by everything involving pain, injuries and such so I kinda stumbled on this by accident."
HadToHurt,fciu40q,t3_ehe8qj,1577669851.0,Well at least now you feel how much you should appreciate that gift.

witcher,fcage3w,t1_fcac797,1577568768.0,Okay so I was summing up one evening I recently had during uni and got to about 28 units (as far as I can remember at least).... Then I read further and saw you shouldn't have more than 14 units a week and even that spread over several days..... Well farewell liver you had a challenging life
witcher,fc8kbjj,t1_fc8jxvf,1577536709.0,"I started because I used to read a lot but didn't have time due to uni and other activities and that's how I got to enjoy books again during things like driving, cooking, walking, ect. I basicly always have one going when I can."
witcher,fc8j8yc,t1_fc8cubr,1577536088.0,Oh ok must have forgot. I just binge listened to them all on audible in like 6 months and missed a lot I think
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc83yja,t1_fc5xxqs,1577526331.0,"Dude like I don't even have to do anything (though occasionally night shifts and finals have done their part) my sleep schedule is just so fucked up one day I can't sleep till 4 am and have to get up at 7 guess what yea I'm fucking tired. Other day falling asleep at 12 but waking up at 4 for some reason guess what, tired. Sleeping for 10h, yes also tired for no reason.

Though there are also the days where I'm productive with 3h of sleep so I guess that's a plus"
TIHI,fc82j12,t3_eg9dqt,1577525198.0,I literally just upvoted every comment of you too because this is fucking amazing and one upvote just for the post doesn't do it justice
NoahGetTheBoat,fc820kf,t1_fc81lvq,1577524790.0,Well I was talking about linking the source. Seems like the hentai fits right in. Also have a upvote fellow fucked up lurker
NoahGetTheBoat,fc81hnz,t3_egod0t,1577524388.0,Well r/guro would love this
NoahGetTheBoat,fc81fo7,t1_fc80jaw,1577524341.0,Thank God I'm not the only one who f or some reason needed to see that.
witcher,fc7zj7x,t1_fc7qyb3,1577522834.0,"Well that's how it is in the show. The books don't really explain why magicians can't bare a child. Though yennefer still would like to be able though and is verry direct about her own choices, which would qualify as feminism. On the other hand she doesn't extend that view beyond her own personal and suggests in a ideal world women should be there just to bare children. Just as complex of a character as anyone else."
facepalm,fc568kb,t1_fc3h3dc,1577445329.0,Add to that my confusion because there is another way of saying large numbers common in Europe where 1 mil x 1000 isn't a billion but a milliard and a billion is 1mil x 1mil which would already be a trillion in the base 1000 system.
bisexual,fc312ev,t1_fc2q1do,1577379030.0,If you like the show and the games the books are on audible diceded to listen to them because why not and half a year later I have the entire saga plus the prequels done. Also there is a pen and paper rpg of the witcher which is quite nice.
bisexual,fc2yxlr,t1_fc2srlp,1577377648.0,"Well that's kind of his main thing. Being hot, playing music, sleeping around, getting in trouble and being geralt's best friend."
HumansBeingBros,fc0sd06,t1_fc0ed1b,1577298521.0,"Where I live we don't have Santa but something else called the ""Christkind"" and a few years ago my little brother who was 7 or 8 at the time wanted my sister to set her phone up with video so he could see it. My sister set it up and then cut it so one moment the Christmas tree was dark and the other all candles burning, presents under the tree and all. It was so nice to see how he wondered what happened and to this day, he is almost 10 now he still believes. It's beautiful to keep that magic up."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fbw54hy,t1_fbvzic5,1577141193.0,"Austria by far not the wonderland it sounds like but it's quite cool to have free education, Healthcare and plesent cops, there are even a few that volunteer as EMT or firefighter in their time off."
