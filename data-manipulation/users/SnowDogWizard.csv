elderscrollsonline,fetle3q,t3_eqhay4,1579376557.0,"You could just buy the Greymoor pre-order and it will give the base game, Morrowind, Summerset, and Elsweyr. You will also get the pre order bonuses too."
dogs,fetgpmv,t1_fetdlsh,1579375248.0,"Get another vet! You don't need a vet degree to know that doesn't make logical sense. Do you expect to cough blood when you speak loudly? No, so don't fall for that excuse."
elderscrollsonline,feq25br,t1_feot759,1579336427.0,The biggest? When did they say that?
elderscrollsonline,femh99j,t3_epul79,1579255440.0,Werewolves are going to have a part in the dark heart of Skyrim. Let's hope they bring some changes to the werewolves.
dogs,feioz82,t3_ep51hq,1579143646.0,"It took about 4 months to bond with my pup Koko. I was honestly frustrated with her at first cause she just would not listen and would always nip at people... eventually she started being more affectionate and trainable. I love my Koko now more than ever, she is a sweet spirited pup."
dogs,fcz0fgv,t3_ejmgju,1578091134.0,I don't think you need to be willing to sell your companion. I just think you can turn that suggestion into a business. You can be a trainer or breeder that trains & sells well-trained pups to good homes.
EarthPorn,fcuih00,t3_eixaql,1577981736.0,I've only been to Germany for 2 days & I wish everyday to go back to travel that beautiful country.
dogs,fcglhq8,t3_eh2zqc,1577641364.0,"Your sister is definitely an entitled parent. Where exactly is all this happening? Your mom's place, your own place, or your sister's place? Whoever's home it is then that is who has final say over house rules. If its your place, I suggest setting up house rules that the child & your sister must follow. Enforcing house rules is not abuse or aggression it is plain ol' discipline."
Edmonton,fc7nhpb,t1_fc6ml9b,1577513361.0,"That type of carelessness costs people their lives. It is simply one incident away from involuntary manslaughter. Please, OP do report it to management."
dogs,fc1325s,t3_effz12,1577306840.0,Advice on here besides basic training is terrible. A lot of Redditors on r/dogs also seem to be the spiritual successor to entitled parents when it comes to dogs.
elderscrollsonline,fbirxzz,t1_fbilkn9,1576911556.0,but you certainly would make a good one lol
