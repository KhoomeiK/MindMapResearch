Healthyhooha,fgui5os,t1_fgtz3wm,1581121401.0,"> but they've always seemed like they would be really messy?

I find them less messy than a tampon. Though, if you're from the US or another place were tampons have applicators, you might have to used to touching your vagina more than before, because the cup does need to placed correctly, so you have to get in there. 

Since using the cup, I have not had a spill, have not have a leak where an errant string acts as a blood wick or where even a huge night pad lets blood run down my crack or similar. There is also a LOT less discomfort in general. I had similar problems with tampons , either because they dried everything out too much if the blood flow isn't strong enough (since it sucks up *all* moisture that touches it, not just blood) or because there wasn't enough blood and I had to get it up there anyway. A bit of lube helped with that, but dryness was an issue every period and it was very uncomfortable.

My loo doesn't have a sink, that's separate with the bathtub, so I actually only wipe the cup out with TP before putting it back in. I get a few pieces off the TP roll beforehand, then I can use the other to get the cup out and empty it (that is basically done at the same time, I don't lift it and then lower it back to the bowl). Give it a moment to empty, since it's not just blood in there but thicker stuff, it needs a moment to slide out sometimes.

Then I wipe it off and reinsert it, still with the same hand, so the other one is clean and can be used for pulling up pants and opening doors.

I figure the risk is low, since any problems usually come from blood that's been sitting too long and usually also in a spongy warm environment (with the tampons that cause toxic shock), and what isn't wiped off is an extremely low amount and similar to what the vagina self-cleans without trouble. If your usual TP is too linty because it's the thin US kind, bring those 10-packs with tissues used to blow your nose with (I seem to remember the US has those, too).

You may need to find the right cup, and if your cervix sits low during menstruation, you might feel the tiny grip thing poking at your entrance. If that's the case, you can just cut it off, the cup will sit close enough for your fingers to still reach.

I was *so* glad after I made the switch to the cup, because my periods have become such a non-issue. No more smells, or having some blood on your skin still, or fear of leaks, which all came with using pads! No more pain from drying out through tampons! No more needing to dispose of blood-filled spongy things that both also can start to smell! The cup really is a great invention."

But the fifties were very much a ""let's leave the war behind us""-decade, and people born a bit later than that already wouldn't have gained much insight. If anything, that is probably the generation were rumours like that would've been spread and fought over. But today, that's not something that is happening.

The part of where they don't say anything about the other who do drugs is a bit unclear – are you in a group situation? Or was that in a general sense? 

If it's a group thing, it may be that for other patients, those may not yet be in a situation where their drug use can even be approached as a problem, and the therapists are still working on even keeping them safe and stable in a general sense before that issue can be approached. They have to assess each patient individually, and adjust their care accordingly. Maybe you are functioning on a higher level already, and so, because drug use *is* a problem, and does need to be addressed, they try to work with you on the things they regard as workable problems, and challenge you more.

The people who look suave put on a specific kind of mask, and might need it to keep themselves together. If that intersects with them being the kind of people who have (as yet unchallenged) drug problems, then they remain unchallenged not because the therapists can't see through them, but because they might be patients who are currently too fragile and might crash completely if anyone tried to work with them on stopping or reducing drug consumption.

I very much understand how that could be super irritating for someone who does get challenged. Is there any therapist or counselor you could talk to that about? Because your anger might prevent you from accepting their care and impact your own therapy. It can be as simple as saying ""hey, why do you not talk to other people about their drug use, but keep needling me? That does not feel good, and I feel singled out and picked on."""
AskWomenOver30,fgqq72w,t3_ezs6jo,1581029169.0,"You don't assume by default that a relationship is non-monogamous. Doubly so if STI-checks were done specifically to facilitate unprotected sex.

This was him making a unilateral decision and waiting out for how long it would go undiscovered, and a plan (even if not completely formulated in his mind) to see if he can keep you when you find out, or not.

There are states and countries where unprotected sex against people's will is counted as sexual assault, and seeing how you only agreed to unprotected sex after STI-tests and under the assumption that he wouldn't do anything to change that STI-status after the fact (like by fucking other people without your knowledge), he is clearly edging if not outright stepping over that line.

That's exactly why it's a violation of privacy, and HIPAA-relevant. Discussing you with another therapist is not the same as using information another patient gave another therapist and then talking about it with you, *especially* if the other patient is so easily identifiable. And vice versa; never should it be possible for your mom to know that a certain information originated with you. The clause you signed also doesn't necessarily mean that ""discussing you"" is the same as ""identifying the person they are discussing by name"", though for details on that, a therapist in the US would have to weigh in. But what they did was in fact something you could've reported them on. The rules are so tight that a therapist isn't even allowed to confirm that they know a person you know (let alone that they are seeing them as a patient), even if you already know they know them because that person is your friend and told you.

It shows her grow from a kid singer to this big star, and all the while how the pressure of media and public gets to her and how people will say anything they want to make a controversy and earn money from it. 

The second half was especially interesting, because there it shows what happened when Kanye West grabbed that Mic from her and the aftermath, and how she had no control at all while being maligned all the time – by him just as much as by other people. He's nothing but a bully, and people blindly followed his lead. She was just ~~17~~ [edit: 19] when he originally did that, and ~~18~~ when he made that song where he called her a bitch [edit: he did that 6.5 years later, after half-heartedly making nice before, and then proceeded to invent her consent to said track and its publication, going so far as to have his wife publish a heavily edited video of the time when they supposedly had a conversation about her allowing it, and then unleashing fan hate when she pointed out that nothing in the video actually had her say that, or showed her knowing he'd be calling her a bitch in it. [Here's a timeline](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8355768/taylor-swift-kanye-west-interrupts-vma-relationship-timeline), I really don't care enough to rehash it all]. The documentary shows how deeply she was rattled by it all, and how it took years for her to deal with it and all that followed.

Towards the end, she also has a long bit where she talks about how there is so much pressure on female stars especially, and that they have to reinvent themselves constantly where male stars can just stay the same. And how each reinvention needs to be just interesting enough, but not too weird, comforting to the public but still challenging enough, and how easy it is to completely lose yourself in that process. And also how hard it can be to find your own voice and to dare to show anything that is a truly personal stance and might upset people. In the last third, they show how she begins to take a political stance, and how big a step that was and how much consideration she needed to have for backlash (which did come). but also how it had become unbearable to not speak out for what she believes is important (like women's rights and gay rights).

Taylor Swift was never among the music I sought out or a person I thought about (not into the whole celebrity-worhsip), but I was impressed by how reflective and intelligent she was throughout. The documentary only uses herself speaking as the main voice overlay, so it's very personal and could've gone very wrong, too.

It also was the person I do those courses with who directed me towards getting therapy in addition to it, because he thought it would be helpful for me to enter into therapy with a motherly figure to work through certain family issues that have to do with my mother, and to have support that is both taking place regularly and also completely payed for by health insurance (since money is an issue for me). I still see him, too, because both systems for me complement each other very well for me personally.

The body work helped me be free of a lot of pain I was holding in various parts of my body, and especially helped me realize and then let go how much tension I was holding all the time in my upper body especially. I'm not saying it was easy; it's hard in a different way than therapy by talking, but you still do it by finding and working through emotions that for the longest time, you've been holding. Part of it is talking, but a lot of it is feeling stuff. But it works great for me, especially because I usually have a habit of intellectualizing everything and avoiding painful emotions that way.

What is important is that, like with therapy, you find a professional, ethical person that matches well with you to do it with. The guy I go to follows similar rules as a therapist does concerning confidentiality, has good boundaries, has no interest in binding you to him or make you dependent on his guidance (the main goal is always to leave your power with yourself and get you to a place where you can rely on yourself, instead of needing to lean on others or get their approval), and has a clear structure he follows that makes sure that after a session ends, the client is well and grounded with themselves again.

It *immensely* sucks that your mother was not able to give you what you needed and deserved. You should've had it so much better. But this also can't be changed (I know, Captain Obvious here). The kind of transference you experience is super painful right now, but it will get better, and avoiding the pain would not heal it but simply make sure it stays part of your life. Only by allowing your therapist to model that kind of mother, and help you through it and that way let you experience the care of a mother figure, will help the pain get less and, eventually let you be your own carer. But first comes the experience of being worth such caring and consideration. And then, slowly, you will be able to provide the same care and consideration out of yourself for yourself, and find ways to let the people you have in your world provide it. Right now, that can't work, because that field in your inner landscape has never been tended to, and it's overgrown with gnarly bushes and wild vegetation, so there is no room for more delicate flowers. 

Staying with your therapist, living through the pain and transference, but experiencing her care, will help creating the space in you to find and accept that kind of love and care in your life outside of therapy.

To get closer to being able to have a part of yourself taking on that care, it might also be helpful to look into inner child work. We have all the younger versions of ourselves in us, and often the pain and anger and feelings of abandonment and not being loved enough come from an earlier time in our life, and in a way need to go back to and heal it there, with that younger version of us, before we can move on with our adult self."

If what you go through makes you unable to properly help people with certain things, I'd expect you to refer them out, but only if those issues are actually a hindrance, not simply because they exist. That could go for eating disorders just as much as for grief or marital problems or whatever.

You either can do your work well or not, but that is for you, the professional, to figure out and act upon, not for me. I trust in your capacity to do so and would have no hangup as long as you and your control mechanisms think you're fine to keep doing your work.

I do not, however, want to hear about it, or about any insecurities you may have regarding that. I need that Chinese wall between your life and mine, where you share only what is beneficial to me and the therapeutic outcome (or things that are neutral, I'm fine with sharing for the sake of us both being a fully three dimensional person), or what I need to know because it will be unavoidable and affect therapy, like my therapist being seriously ill.

Shit like this is what leads to cases where someone ends up near raped/intrusively groped, or proper raped by someone who claims that they didn't say no, so it must've been ok.

He didn't need any bad intentions, he was already doing bad things by pressing his near-naked body to someone else's near naked body, from behind, in a generally vulnerable situation, without for a second checking if any of this was ok or wanted. That is not an accident, that is pure intent. What he got, he deserved, and that would've held true even if your aim had been better.

germany,fgbootv,t3_expo82,1580664396.0,"Your only real option is to get back with TK and pay what you owe. All insurances offer arrangements to pay in installments though, by adding extra amounts to your regular fee. I once was in a similar situation where I had my student insurance go on although I'd finished university (not intentionally, I just didn't have it on my radar), and they eventually found out. It's not fun, but will enable you to get insurance and continue your studies.

I'm not sure what you mean with not being able to reach an agreement due to being unemployed, employment or not only is a factor for the amount of the insurance fee, not for if they insure you or not. I was self-employed at the time (still am actually), so didn't have an employer in the classic sense either. And you're not unemployed, you're a student. Being unemployed is a different thing since it usually involves the job center etc.

Your problems will only get bigger if you don't manage to re-register as a student. 
Trying to get another insurance, then keeping the debt with the Krankenkasse and ignoring it is also not a good idea, because afaik they charge an enormous interest.

Edit: I just saw below that you already had to pay 2k to unblock your account, and now you say you also still have to pay 1k. That math doesn't make sense at all, even with fees it could never get to that amount for the time period you give. It would however make sense if you failed to provide proof to them that you were a registered student, as in that case they simply charge the fee for voluntary insurance (meaning the kind where no employer contributes half, so you pay both halves of an insurance premium that is based on an assumed minimum income, leading to insurance costs of about €300). If that is the case, your very first step is to provide them with back documentation that you were a student, since there is also a time limit for how long you can do that after the fact. At some point, the assumed income becomes the set one, and no delayed proof is going to change the set rate anymore, even if you were an enrolled student.

If you can, find a native German speaker and have them read through all the letters you received. And I mean *all* of them, this is not the time to hold shit back out of shame. I have the impression that you not only completely ignored the things you had to take care of in general, but then also only partly understood the letters you received. The student union at your university should be able to help you there if there is no friend that can do it.

As an incentive, consider that if what I think happened is true, your insurance fee for the time period could potentially get adjusted, and since the 2k they already took would be too much, any part of it that is too much would get reimbursed. About 1k. Meaning you'd be already set for a year of normal insurance fees at €90. 

I have no idea though if that is truly what happened, but you have no choice but cleaning up the mess anyway. So get on doing that."

Even with the new laws, Berlin landlords can freely do modernizations that lead to increases of up to 50cent/sqm, and more expensive ones after getting approval. It also still allows for doing several modernizations in a row, each one coming with their own increase. So factually, there is no true limit on raising rent for having done modernizations.

In Germany, anything that is part of the lease contract is something the landlord is then responsible for maintaining. So if they have a kitchen in, that means if a fridge breaks or a sink leaks, they have to take care of it.

Sometimes, when someone knows the previous renter, they can buy it from them (called ""Abstand"") or, if it makes the other renter's life easier to not bother with it, they can agree to leave it. But if they don't know each other, anyone leaving a flat has to leave it empty, so rarely if ever will the landlord allow them to leave a kitchen even if the next renter might benefit from it.

It's not that difficult to get at least a basic kitchen though, and I certainly wouldn't skip a cheap and otherwise suitable apartment over that. You can check on Ebay Kleinanzeigen, there are often whole kitchens, kitchenettes or kitchen elements for very little money or for free, if you're quick enough. Similar with Facebook groups, many cities now have ""free your stuff"", ""zu verschenken"", ""Flohmarkt"" and other groups where you often find kitchen things and other stuff to furnish a flat.

When people have to clean out apartments for deceased relatives or two people move in together, there often are kitchens people want to get rid of or other things. It may not be new and fashionable (though often enough, it's Ikea, so nice enough), but you will likely find what you need quite soon.

Absolutely did. The other part of that ambush was that they got a small boy as well as the grandpa of the family that was taking care of him (orphaned a little while earlier because of a bombing) that had been running out to get him. Or maybe that had been a day or two before, it's been a while since she told the story. The only time she did, though in general she's a big story teller. She and her sister both survived, though her sister got injured a bit more.  
Later, after the war when soldiers of the armed forces were put in the villages, some of them also went around and horrifically gang-raped some of the women.

On the other side of my family, my grandpa has similar stories. When he was 14, he escaped a similar air attack by a hair because he managed to jump into a ditch just in time when he heard them come. Someone else further down the road got shot. The air planes would make a sport of randomly picking off people that happened to be walking or driving down below, it didn't matter if kids, old people or whatever.  
At 16, when he tried to find a way home during a break in his mandatory service (all the boys of I think 15 and above at least in his area were pulled out of school and put into mandatory military service in often distant areas, he was put with the Flak) a truck passed him by and offered a ride, which he didn't take for some reason I don't remember. Some time later, after another air raid had come through, he passed that same truck burning out at the side of the road.

And right after the war ended, the incoming US soldiers went through the town and rounded up all the men they found out on the street 18 and over that they could suspect of being soldiers in some way. He was on the road somewhere and when they went after him, he managed to get away and climbed up the side of a farm house and got into the attic. He said he hid in some compartment next to the chimney stack that had a door (I'm a bit hazy on the details there). He heard the soldiers come into the house and the farm owner being commanded to help search the house, and apparently the farmer came up with a soldier, opened that little door, looked blankly at my grandpa and closed it again without saying anything while the soldier checked the rest of the attic. My grandpa stayed in there for hours, and went out only when it was dark. Turns out the men that were rounded up were all put into some courtyard and simply shot.

She complains because she likes to complain, not because you are a bad daughter that just hasn't been able to remove all the complaint-worthy things.

Be open as much as you can, but don't beat yourself up if things don't come out right, if you clam up, if you forget something you wanted to mention, etc. The therapeutic relationship is built on trust, and that is something that needs to grow.

Especially the first session is mainly one where both of you are getting the lay of the land, so to speak. They will ask about your background, what brings you there, and similar things. There'll also be some, or a lot (it differs) taking of data and an explanation by the therapist of how they work, what their ground rules are especially around cancellation and the light, and other more organizational matters. The first session likely won't feel much like therapy yet, it's more of a getting to know each other.

But the most important thing, again, is that there's nothing for you to mess up. 

You're entering into a process, one that will ebb and flow, feel painful at times and hopeful at others, where you feel sometimes close and sometimes distant to your therapist, where at times you'll feel tempted to quit either because it feels too hard or like nothing is changing, and sometimes both of those at once. The important thing is to stick with it, and also to try and accept the therapist's input and suggestions. You will feel resistance at times or wonder if something they suggest isn't useless, so why do it. Give them a chance, they see and know things about you you yourself aren't aware of. 

Therapy is most successful if the patient also puts work in it, but that means just doing the best you can, and if that sometimes just is showing up and then crying the whole time for three sessions in a row, or having something big you can't get out, all that is fine and part of the process. Try to communicate those issues – more often than not the advice people receive here when they wonder about something here is ""talk to your therapist"". Even small issues are important, sometimes they are the tiny thread that eventually helps unravel something huge. They need to know the things you are grappling with, be it something about yourself or something regarding them and your connection to them.

If you come with documentation, a normal GP will usually simply continue your medication at least for the first prescription, or as long as it takes you to find an endocrinologist or get an appointment with the Nuklearmedizin at a hospital (they also are qualified to care for thyroid issues). GPs also can check for your TSH, though not all of them are willing to also do ft4 and ft3 with the bloodwork and will insist a specialist check those levels. That's because the insurance companies quite have their thumb on the GPs for any costs that aren't ""necessary"", and the GPs deal with that differently. Some GPs even can do the ultrasound part.

TalkTherapy,ffey6z5,t1_ffemyjv,1579870134.0,"> It's hard to directly ask for help. I feel like a burden or that I'm attention seeking when asking for help.

This is a very understandable problem, and something I also struggle with. I think that often though, the other side isn't truly aware of that, and doesn't realize that the fact we reached out *at all* is, in itself, already a sign of how bad a state we are in, and that we really do need help no matter how the message itself is phrased. And I agree with u/tidalwhoo, the words as such weren't really showing what you were actually struggling with. So from their side, your therapist may have waited to see if you were in a bad way, or just already seeking contact at a point where there was some emotional discomfort but no actual emergency.

People on here frequently write of messaging with their therapist, but I'm not sure how normal that is to happen in general, and actually doubt is a normal m/o for most therapists. And consequently I expect that therapists would usually try to limit text contact and only react when they are absolutely sure it's necessary, but try not to encourage a regular kind of exchange thing. Boundaries are important, as is for a client learning to calm themselves down without the aid of a therapist. Being open for regular chit chat and continually touching base as a therapist isn't, in the long run, truly helpful for the client to achieve emotional self-sufficiency and independence. I know that isn't what you were after at all, but from the therapists side that is what they have to keep in mind and balance with the immediate needs of patients, and may lead to not respond to vague and, on the face of it, not that alarming sounding messages.

Since your therapist did agree to be there when you really, really need them, it might be helpful to agree on a prepared message that you can safe somewhere and only send off in an emergency (that way, you also wouldn't have to struggle with typing something out in the moment), so there is no way for them to misunderstand your need, or maybe a keyword to include if you'd rather write on the spot, so there still is no doubt what you need even if you choose wording that otherwise make the message seem less alarming than your actual emotional situation is."

It must've felt amazing to realize after meeting him that you truly have grown past him, and that while you still value the time you had together, being with him is not what you desire anymore at all. 

Not gonna lie, when you wrote about meeting him I was worried for a second it might have rattled you and led to giving him another chance, and I was very happy that's not what happened. I'm also not surprised in the least that the new relationship ended once the new shiny thing wasn't so new and shiny anymore, and that he also realized that, oh, he actually still was into you after all, he just fucked it up big time. 

I'll quote my previous comment for a moment:  
> In choosing her, he actually showed quite clearly just how superficial that ""new"" choice was, because he went for obvious similarities + excitement of new relationship. That's not what someone does who was completely done with where he was before and who he was with, but what someone does who actually liked all that but couldn't get over the hump of actually having to work on the relationship and stick with it through a time that felt felt for a while (partly by his own doing – being overworked and away a lot just isn't helpful for feeling a spark). I'm not writing that to say he's going to become unhappy and will eventually come back – nor should you take him back if it does happen – but to make clearer that the lack wasn't in you but in him.

By getting back with him, you'd likely have set yourself up for a repetition of your previous experience, with him becoming dissatisfied again after a period of excitement and contentment. Huge kudos to you for working on yourself and making sure you can live your best live, and one that's worthy of you, instead of falling back into old patterns. It's not easy, and you did it!

In being that partner, you very much am part of them being able to do what they do. You may not make art yourself anymore, but you are a facilitator of art being created, and that is no small thing. Whatever your partner creates, you are in some way part of what gives him the freedom to do so. You didn't make the thing, but without you, it probably wouldn't have been made.

Iirc the Hemnes it's not the same in one important aspect though, and that's the second set of slats being under the main ones in the Hemnes. That's important both breathability. 

With the slats interlocking so tightly in the way you built that bed, the mattress has no breathing room, it's like a mattress put on the floor in that regard. That leads to a bad sleeping environment and most importantly usually also to mold. We sweat out between half a liter and two liters of moisture each night (about 1/8 to half a gallon), and that moisture needs to go somewhere. There's a reason why futon beds that rest directly on the floor need to be rolled up each day, it's not just for space issues.

It's annoying extra work, but I'd really suggest to remove a number of slats per frame, at least 3-4 if not more, and affix them again with more distance. 

You could also make it so that the two frames in your design are separated similarly to the ones of the Hemnes. Maybe by putting some support under the bed frame head and foot part, and have the second frame be under it instead of interlocked. Then when you want to use it, you pull it out, hook it into the lengthwise beam you put it as support by means of two right-angle metal bits you affix to the top and bottom most slat, and put two supports of the same height you used on the main bed frame under the two feet. That would probably be easier than trying to rebuild both sets of slats with a bigger distance. Pretty simple actually, once you got over the fact that you're not completely finished yet :) and much better than sleeping on a moldy mattress. Should be a cinch for you, you did really nice work with your original design (and much respect for giving it a go at all)."

TalkTherapy,fez83jd,t1_feyvnao,1579454674.0,"> Therapists don’t “abandon” clients. Are you 6 years old? There is no abandonment and this gets thrown around here SO often! You can completely take care of yourself! He isn’t “leaving you”, he’s moving on to whatever he has to do in his adult life.

What the hell?! Feelings of abandonment are a real thing, and it's normal for them to come up in this kind of situation. I have no idea why you think it's ok to shame someone for having them, and for trying to be open about them here. And yes, for patients it can indeed feel like the therapist is leaving them, *especially* if said therapist was so foolhardy as to promise to never do that. 

It's also normal that during therapy, younger parts of us make an appearance, but that's not someone being childish, but quite the opposite – it's *supposed* to be able to happen, and therapy is supposed to be a safe space to facilitate that. We need to be able to access those early feeling that have left deep grooves in the fabric of our personalities, to be able to understand and, over time, change how they influenced our way of perceiving the world and interacting with it.

> What if you moved to a different state and had to quit therapy and your t had a tantrum about it and accused you of abandoning him? Looks pretty foolish, right? Perspective is SO important in how we move on.

Oi, could you be any more condescending? You're also comparing two things that are absolutely not the same, and not comparable. The client-therapist relationship is uneven by nature, with the therapist *always* in the caretaker position, and the client *always* in the position of being taken care of. If it's not like that, the relationship needs adjustment and usually it comes down to the therapist having issues with countertransference that need to be taken care of through supervision. It's not a client's task to take care of their therapist, ever, and with that comes the freedom for a client to be allowed to brake off therapy at any time. So yes, a therapist getting upset about that would be odd, but not because no one in the therapist-client relationship is supposed to get upset, but because the *therapist* isn't supposed to get upset (at least not in a way visible to the patient), and if they do, they need to get supervision and make their way through it. 

But on the reverse, a client getting upset about something the therapist does actually *is part of the process*. Things like this are *meant* to happen, and then be taken up by the therapist to look at them, calmly, together with the client, to find where in the past the point lies where the deeper pain that got triggered came from.

> Perspective is SO important in how we move on. You can be angry with him OR you can open up about the hurt you feel and how it’s making you feel like a kid again and address that shit in a healthy way to start to heal it.

Perspective comes with distance. Before you can get that distance, you need to live through the feelings and then figure out their roots. Aka what's happening in therapy. There is no ""OR"" there, they can and should be both angry with their therapist AND be open about it, so they can (at least partly, before the therapist has moved on) work through it.


For the case of the OP, there is a child part that is indeed being abandoned by the person that has stepped into a caretaker-role; their therapist. To tell them to just pull themselves together means telling them that they should be able to just step out of the client role and deal with, and ignore that this is just not the kind of relationship they have with a therapist. This is not a favourite hairdresser or baker closing up shop and moving away, but someone who stepped deeply into their soul and took on the role of the one person that should always be there, always be reliable, always accountable. Someone a client can throw (almost) anything at, and the therapist remains cheerfully neutral and unflappable anyway. Someone safe. And a client getting upset when that important reliable person suddenly turns out to not be that dependable after all, that they feel abandoned, is a completely understandable thing.

This is not fun info, but please have your GP do blood tests for both fasting sugars and a glucose tolerance test. If you get jittery and nauseous, that likely means your body can't handle the insulin spike well, and insulin resistance can over time turn into full blown diabetes. But the earlier you catch it, the easier it is to avoid that happening.

The glucose tolerance test checks for the actual reaction under a sugar load, while the fasting sugars may still be fine, that's why you're better of having both in a case like yours. 

In younger people, doctors sometimes neglect to check for that, I'm your age and likely had a resistance since my teens. For me (I'm a woman) it led to PCOS.

Basically, as long as something isn't painful, itchy, swollen, smells weird in a new way, or appears very suddenly without explanation (which it doesn't sound like in your case), you can assume it's all fine.
