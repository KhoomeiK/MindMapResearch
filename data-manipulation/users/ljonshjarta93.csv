nothingeverhappens,ffodbt5,t1_ffo98tn,1580076530.0,I used to work with kids that age when I was 18-22. Not at a school and it was volunteer work but still.
rarepuppers,ffo39az,t1_ffnzrzv,1580073625.0,"It's true. Additionally, many breeders schedule *elective* c-sections in advanse. I've seen this video before and iirc that was the case with this dog. I could go on all day about this stuff but am going out in a couple of mins. Can continue this later if anyone is interested. I also recommend watching the BBC documentary *pedigree dogs exposed* and the follow up *pedigree dogs exposed - three years on*."
nothingeverhappens,ffo1hsm,t1_ffnxixh,1580073179.0,"Yes, but it should be very easy to figure out that this is someone who works at a school or something like that. That is if you have more than one working braincel."
nextfuckinglevel,ffo0vnv,t3_eubgkz,1580072997.0,I really wish I could do flyball with my girl. She could totally run that fast but she *sucks* at fetching. She would definitely drop the ball half way back (on purpose) and just stand there and bark at me until *I* went to get it myself. We are thinking about doing agility instead.

fatpeoplestories,ffezsvg,t1_fbdp3sz,1579871643.0,Or putting the snacks in like raisin containers or other packaging from healthy snacks. She probably wouldn't even look inside.

AmItheAsshole,ffampa1,t3_esjhx2,1579739556.0,"YTA - do you think your mom doesn't care about her fosterchild?? If she didn't care she wouldn't have taken her in. That's why she would probably be extremely sad to see you exclude her. She *loves* her fosterchild whether you like it or not and having such an important photo of her fosterdaughter and her other kids together would probably mean the world to her. This day is about your *mom*, not you. 

Plus, your fostersister has most likely had a very difficult life. The way you talk about her is honestly disgusting. You sound like an entitled bitch."

fatlogic,ffab9cs,t3_erxxgo,1579731517.0,"I had a heart sonar yesterday and had to take off my shirt for it. Yes, it made me a bit uncomfortable but it would never occur to me to ask a medical proffessional if I could leave my shirt on, let alone demand it. They see all kinds of bodies every day and they are so used to it that they probably don't think about it at all. Like in this instance, she was probably more interested in what my heart looked like than the outside lol"

sadcringe,ff9agto,t1_ff91prm,1579708531.0,Vegan here. This is either satire or this person is completely insane. I think the former is more likely. Most vegans agree that cats should not be on a plant based diet. Those few who disagree still make sure their cats get synthetic taurine (taurine is afaik the only thing cats cannot get from plants and it is absolutely essential for them to live). All the vegan cat owners I know give their cats a meat/fish based diet.
fatlogic,ff5or3j,t3_erdeb4,1579603680.0,"This person should try swimming regularly. Swimming is good exercise and puts no pressure on the joints.

JusticeServed,ff1zl3x,t1_ff1yp68,1579489883.0,"You seem to care an awful lot about this ""idiot"". Do the two of you have some kind of tragic backstory? 'Cause it's kind of weird that you don't care at all about anyone else the driver could have hurt if the cyclist did nothing but you care so much about the cyclist that you feel like he shouldn't have stopped this ""maniac"" (your words, not mine) long enough for police (whom he called) to arrive because it was ""too risky""..."
JusticeServed,ff1yj9u,t1_ff1ya13,1579489131.0,"Ah, so just because someone is standing in front of your car it is okay to hit them on purpose? Gotcha.

He was probably risking it to keep other people safe. Something that you would clearly never do. Well, it's a good thing there are at least some people in the world who care about others (like the cyclist)"
JusticeServed,ff1yavh,t1_ff1y65u,1579488970.0,You are saying that nobody should have done anything. That IS defending the driver's actions.
JusticeServed,ff1l9av,t1_ff0l64o,1579481004.0,I agree. I'm not a furry myself but have known a couple. They're just like everyone else really.

Also, do you not realise that the driver could have seriously hurt someone driving on a lane that isn't supposed to have any cars? Is that just fine and dandy? Should we all just let people do that if we're not police officers? What about driving on the sidewalk or in a public park or at a town square? Should we let people do that too?"

NeckbeardNests,fenf1pw,t1_fen3ylb,1579283296.0,"I doubt they will care enough about your trash to look in it. Besides, at least where I live the workers don't actually put the garbage in the truck manually. They roll the bin to the truck and attach it to a robot arm thingy and that thing empties the bin, then the worker rolls the bin back.
I think your anxiety is making you overthink this. Just throw them out, you'll feel so much better. If you don't think you can do it that way, just empty them into the toilet first and then throw the bottles away (I don't think you should recycle them because it could be a health hazard)

Good luck at dealing with this and getting your mental illnesses under control. It's not gonna be easy by any means but you are important and you deserve to be happy. Keep working on yourself and you will reach a good place in your life."

fatlogic,fen9om5,t1_fem8gkm,1579280005.0,"I used MFP for a while after I changed my diet to check my protein intake, not to loose weight."
fatlogic,fen9c2p,t3_eppxr0,1579279792.0,Both being overweight AND underweight can cause heart issues. But overweight people are more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes.
fatlogic,fen92ao,t3_eppewe,1579279628.0,"Many people seem to not understand the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 is genetic so sugar intake is not what causes it. Type 2 is diet related. 
I have insulin resistance (pre diabetes) too but when I asked my doctor if I should cut down on sugar/carbs she told me not to worry about it since my blood sugar levels were fine. I live on a healthy diet though and am not overweight anymore. But someone who lives on junk food should watch out for sugar and fat intake and/or take preemptive medicine.

As for the not trusting doctors thing, I do get that. I had *several* doctors misdiagnose my spinal damage as a ""mental illness"". The condition I have is both progressive and completely preventable with medical intervention. It took me six months and many many hospital visits to get a diagnosis and when I finally did it was mostly a coincidense. If they had taken me seriously from the start I might still be able to walk.

So yeah, even though I do generally speaking trust doctors as a group, there are many doctors who are simply put arrogant assholes and some people have genuine reasons not to trust them."
