Of what I know, for more symbolism like this, watch the doorways and openings that Rey and Luke both use. Almost all of them are very yonic, to the extent that it shows their ""rebirth"" or new beginnings. The opening to the tree containing the Jedi texts, the split in the rock inside the temple where Luke/Rey speak about the Jedi failures, and the busted open doorway on Crait are all very vagina-esque."

Sounds like a crazy reach, I know. But if you look at the alien and compare it to the underlying muscular structure of the vagina, they're almost completely identical.

>You are the one that is somehow tying stone statues to racism and slavery.

Lies. The statues and monuments were largely created and placed by the organization Daughters of the Confederacy, which has a history of whitewashing the Confederacy, opposing racial inequality, and perpetuating the image of content enslaved blacks and benevolent white enslavers.

False equivalence. Destroying a statue is not erasing history. History books and museum exhibits are history, statues that blindly idolize and whitewash the past are not.

What parts the traitorous Confederacy are you proud of? Why do you consider *that* part of your culture and heritage, to the expense of literally anything else?

>According to people like you, no families from the Confederacy should've ever been sad that their sons were killed in a war.

Another false equivalence. The Germans didn't build statues to the Nazis no matter how many parents might have been sad their sons died while systematically killing Jews. We shouldn't have built and placed statues for racist traitors, *especially* during the time of the Civil Rights Act. The timing alone makes it very clear that these statues were not about history, they were about black submission.
