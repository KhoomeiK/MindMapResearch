Echoing others: you did the research yourself before hand but didn't include him in it at all. One of THE most important things in marriage is communication.

I have 3 children. My eldest I was there to see be birthed, but my 2nd and 3rd kiddos my wife and I had a long discussion about how our oldest was born. Birth was messy, long, and stressful and so when my 2nd was about to be born my wife and I spoke and agreed that this time I was to stand by her head and not look directly down there because it made her feel uncomfortable and vulnerable.

I obliged because we talked about it beforehand. You literally posted how you had known this prior to the incident and then sprung it on him last moment and embarrassed him by having him thrown out.

I'm sorry you feel bad now, but you reap what you sew. I do not at all blame your husband for mentioning divorce and feeling entirely embarassed and alienated from an occasion that (given he's not a shit person) any father would be excited for. Even after my 2nd and 3rd I was still excited just to hold my wife's hand and share in the tears of joy as that little face entered the world and I can't imagine being treated by my wife the way you treated him... 

Hate to say it but that probably killed your marriage."

This related well to me because an ex of mine got quite lazy near the end of our relationship. I clung so hard to wanting to help her get her shit together and she would...for 2 weeks at a time and then she was back to her old self.

That was 3.5 years ago and now I'm in a relationship with somebody is who self-sufficient, driven, and passionate about her life goals. It makes a world of difference to be with somebody who isn't sucking the life out of you.

You already are paying your own way through life and clearly don't need his help. My therapist/life coach also gave me a bit of advice that really helped and I want to leave for you:

There is nothing wrong with you being invested in your own happiness no matter how hard it might be to let go of somebody you love. There are 7.2 billion people on this planet and if that person in your life now isn't the right fit... Well, there's literally billions of others out there who you could meet that might be of a similar mindset as you. So focus on yourself and your happiness no matter how much it hurts to see him go at first."

aww,ff53phi,t3_erp36r,1579579375.0,"So a bit of backstory on miss Tiki.

I found her at the Texads ADL shelter. I was originally looking at a Doberman but his energy levels were crazy high which didn't fit my lifestyle as a dog groomer.

I came across miss Tiki. She was docile, sweet, and licked my face as if I was the only person to ever see her.

The ADL encourages walking the dog around campus and playing in their enclosed spaces to see how they act and if they fit you.

Tiki thought I was taking her on a trip across the world. She ran, fetched, jumped, and ran circles around me with her toy.

Shortly after I decided, with zero hesitation, she was the one for me.

Once we got home it took her a bit to trust me. At first she was pooping in a corner. Slowly I let her sleep on the bed with me after a few nights. 

The 4th night she just snuggled up right next to me and she stole my heart.

After a bunch of trial and error I found she knew: sit, shake, kennel, outside, and look. She now is my biggest fan. The crazy thing? She knows grounding. When I stress out, yell, or cry...she nuzzles up on my lap and suddenly The world doesn't seem so bad.

I'm lucky. Very. So to those worried about shelter dogs... Just know there is one out there for you."

Also, remember it's your marriage, your life, and the two of you have all the right in the world to do whatever you feel is best for you two.

My first marriage was partially ruined due to my MIL intrusive behavior. She disciplined my boys in her own way despite what my ex-wife and I had already had set.

It caused a ton of problems and instead of putting our collective feet down we ignored it and it got worse.

My 2 closest friends in 2017 had a baby who was a 3 month old premie. After weeks in the NICU their newborn son died. His heart just...stopped.

She also had heath complications so she was still in the hospital. They finally had gotten to the point they felt they could relax and were having a little romantic steak dinner in the hospital room. 45min into their first chance to relax and a doctor walks in to tell them the news.

Just to give an idea of the kind of people they are: They both are the epitome of extroverted ""life of the party"" type people with endless energy and optimism....

After that day nobody heard from them or saw them for 2 months. Many of us stopped by their house, called, left gift baskets and food on their porch. Anything to make their lives easier. 

I finally got a call one day from her husband asking if I could pick them up at a state park cause their car was dead. I was super happy they were okay and just glad they didn't go off and kill themselves.

When I picked them up they both looked like they had been stranded on an island for years. They smelled, clothes were dirty, and they both were just silent the entire 45min drive home. To this day they aren't the same people I once knew... That outgoing shine in their eyes is gone.

If you can't afford what you're aiming for you need to lower the bar a bit. Don't plan a $40k dollar wedding if your budget involves asking or expecting others to help you pay. If you can't afford it, then postpone the wedding and either save your money or reevaluate your spending."

I joined the Army after high school and had a gf of 3 years. As soon as I shipped out for training my girlfriend was devastated, but she had college to prepare for. 

In basic training everything was great. We wrote letters back and forth and everything seemed perfect. (She even sent me a nude I had to hide from everyone). It took me 9 months before I made it home only to find out she had been cheating on me for 6 of those months. She said she felt lonely and that college was such a new experience she felt confused.

You're young and between you being in the military and her starting college both of your world's are about to change. You'll be a different person when you finish training and she will be as well once she starts to experience college life.

Again, you're very mature to realize your lives are going in different directions and for that I commend you!!! Just be honest with her and if the two of you weren't meant to be together your relationship will find it's way back. Goodluck brother and welcome to the U.S. Military!

Entitled selfish women who think they contribute just as much to the military as their husbands and thus throw fits when they don't get what they want.

I was in my 3rd year in the Army. I was a Specialist (E-4) and I was walking into the PX (it's like a mall on post for any foreigners or non-military) and a lady was walking out. I held the door open for her and after she walked out she doubled back and said ""excuse me...""


So I turned ""yes ma'am?""
Her: ""I didn't get a salute""
Me: ""ma'am? Um, saluting isn't required if the other person isn't in uniform..""
Her: ""My husband is Lieutenant Colonel Whatever you'd do best to salute me.""
I straight up ignored her and walked in as she kept yelling after me. My first 2 months in a real unit and one of my Sergeants told me the post I was on was full of entitled bitches who liked to do that and to ignore them. I didn't believe him until then.

 Now that I'm out and did my time sometimes I go back on post to shop or get cheap gas. If I ever see or hear some dependa doing this to a lower enlisted I step in because they only do it to lower enlisted who don't know any better. If she tried that on a 1sgt or CSM they'd laugh in her face."

I apologize on behalf of all Texans. I'm an athiest, and while most people don't ever criticise me, there are still a lot of old school jackasses here who think their way is the only way and everyone else is trash.

As conservative as this state is, most of us are tolerant these days, but again there are still some assholes.

To answer you question: you did not react harshly. You stood up for yourself and your beliefs and you did exactly what you should've. Never be guilt tripped into living how you want. We only have one life to live, don't spend it with people who will try to suppress your lifestyle and criticize your choices."

For all you know they coulda just been avoiding going into a house, apartment, or movie theater. Also, one of those kids coulda been sober. Can't just damn them all on an assumption or our system would be wildly unfair."

Edit: also, most companies don't do ""door to door"" anymore. That shit ended in the 90s. With the internet and delivery service, nobody sends people out to knock on doors for that exact reason: it's suspect. 
We had a group of people in Texas trying to do that for a vacuum company called Kirby. When they knocked I asked them to wait a minute. Called kirby and found out you have to ask for an in-house demo and they dont just show up. Called the cops and reported their plate numbers after they sped off thanks to my 3 outdoor security cams."
aww,fcfvpfo,t3_eh5pxh,1577634195.0,I just woke up and already my eyes are watering...all this damn dust. *sniff*
