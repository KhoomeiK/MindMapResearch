You're so right, no two bipolars are alike, as no two brains are alike.  The neurology of the human mind is one of the most complex areas of study that I can think of.  And I guess 4-5 hours of sleep isn't a ton - I got 6 hours last night, yay!

I'm hypomanic at the moment - been really active, expansive, making lots of social plans, talking tons.  I'm taking my medication and really trying to have a relatively consistent bedtime.  My mood state probably contributed to the length of my post.

Thanks again, and take care."
bipolar2,fexcjyf,t1_ferufsr,1579428668.0,"Thank you so much for your comment.  A lot of what you said really resonates with me.

When I was in my teens and early 20's, I did overly identify with my bipolar disorder as a part of who I was as a person.

More recently, I pursued a proper diagnosis to satiate my curiosity on the subject.   I have an analytical mind, and am a sucker for puzzles. 

When the psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar II, I reached out and shook his hand, thanking him profusely.  After 16 years of feeling intermittently euphoric and hopeless, I finally felt heard.  

He didn't talk down to me, and seemed to recognize that I, for a non-professional, had a fair amount of knowledge of abnormal psychology (I studied it in university, and have since made it my independent area of study ). I left the appointment feeling much less preoccupied with the puzzle that is my mind.

Now that a month and a half has passed; however, an inkling of doubt has taken hold.  My diagnosed OCD is probably also contributing to my obsessive self-analysis.

 I'm hypomanic too, which is probably why I made such a long, rambling post in the first place.  Take care, and thanks again for responding."

addiction,feksacv,t1_fek4v2l,1579206558.0,"I don't honestly see myself ever being unmedicated in the future, as I am so non-functional without my medication that I would likely have to be permanently hospitalized.  

My tricyclic antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic have allowed me to live in an apartment on disability, and still feel human.  The risk of going psychotic is too scary.

A few days ago, I accidentally missed a part of one dose.  Within a day, I dissociated, accidentally almost burnt the apartment down, had two breakdowns, and picked a fight so hurtful with my closest friend that I almost lost them.  I ended the next day with suicidal ideation and a panic attack so bad that I vomited.   I'm recovering now, but boy was that awful.

Cocaine was my biggest and worst demon; I 'only' did meth for the four months before my current ten months of sobriety.  Stimulants, particularly meth, would make me feel level-headed and 'tied-together'.  Before either of those substances, I did a lot of MDMA.  

The first time I did MDMA, I didn't feel 'high' in the traditional sense; just calm, collected, and finally in control.  All those little gestures and words that never came easily to me, suddenly did.  I was complete.  Until it wore off.  And as Hamlet says, 'Ah, there's the rub'.

During my meth use, I had not yet been diagnosed with ADHD, but I should have suspected it.   I would often do a line of it, quickly get sleepy, and have a nap.  This was a paradoxical reaction to stimulants, but it took away none of the drug class's potential for harm.

I'm a 32-year-old woman who used to excel in school, although it took so much effort that it almost killed me.  The ADHD diagnosis was therefore delayed, yet explained so much, and helped me realize that I'm not lazy or stupid.

I had just escaped from many years of abuse when I relapsed.  I was more manic then depressed at the time, yet cared little for my life.  A mixed state, perhaps.  For the first time in ages, no one was controlling me, but the abuse had destabilized me so severely, that I didn't know which end was up.

I definitely relate to the idea of neurodivergence, yet at the same time completely acknowledge that I am mentally ill.   These diagnostic terms are at best approximations for issues that we as humans are only beginning to understand, but they are helpful approximations.  Mental illnesses tend to come in groups, and I've actually encountered a fair few internet folk with many of the same diagnoses.

Hope this helps."
bipolar,fekpylb,t3_epjz11,1579205191.0,"This reminds me of the insomniac delerium that mania and mixed states can cause.  When you see the same image over and over in your mind's eye, moving into itself repeatedly, if that makes sense."

addiction,fejctrp,t3_epetls,1579167649.0,"I abused drugs partly due to my bipolar II disorder, ADHD, PTSD, OCD, and GAD - all professionally diagnosed.  I developed severe anxiety by the time I was 5, but my abusive and neglectful home environment prevented me from getting any help until I was 16, when I had to fight my mother to let me see a doctor.

I don't know what it's like to not feel anxiety and restlessness in every part of my body, 24/7/365.  In my using past, I nearly always chose stimulants, as they affect my adhd-brain in a paradoxical manner.  I would feel 'tied together', focused, and calm, when I used.

Currently, I'm at 10 months clean of meth and crack, 9 months clean of coke, and 5 months clean of ephedrine.  I still consume massive amounts of caffeine, I vape nicotine, and I vape sativa weed (the more energizing variety of cannabis, which is legal where I live).   

I am not sober by some people's definition, but I was able to go 7 years without hard drugs while using the above soft ones, until my recent relapse.  Therefore, I believe this method of harm reduction could work for me again.

bipolar2,fecqiyq,t3_eofh5b,1578980930.0,"Most of the materia that I've read only specifies that one must have mania/hypomania to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  The very first recorded incident of mania will result in a bipolar diagnosis, even if there is no evidence of a depressed episode in the person's past.

It is supsected; however, that the small subgroup of people with bipolar disorder who do not experience depressive episodes will eventually experience one down the road, or already do experience them, yet have such minor ones that it does not occur to them to consult a professional.  

A third possibility is that these people suffer from more mixed episodes, with elements of both mania and depression, owhich can manifest as the irritability that you described.

So it's entirely possible to have bipolar disorder and experience your symptoms.  I've been learning a lot recently about the many faces of the notorious mixed state.  To use an analogy, if depression is 'blue' and mania is 'red', there are myriad shades of 'purple'."

I didn't want to be 'the other' in society - a crazy person, to put it bluntly.

I started developing most of my bipolar II symptoms when I was 15-16, only a few years after I had, through shame and terror over being 'found out' as a mentally ill person, managed to vastly reduce my OCD symptoms on my own.  

Then my mood disorder reared its ugly head.  After a recent assessment with a psychiatrist, however, I now suspect that I may have had childhood bipolar disorder.  At the very least I have a hyperthymic personality.  Oh, and ADHD, GAD, and PTSD too!  Keeps life interesting, I suppose."

I'm hoping this goes away over time - I'm on a new prescription medication for anxiety and adhd (not a stimulant), and it's reducing my sweating, probably because it's helping reduce my nightmares that I get from ptsd.  I hope this helps!"
bipolar2,fdj6osv,t1_fdh02uz,1578459967.0,"I hear ya, I too find it hard to reconcile my image of 'healthy' me with the me in reality.  I've been mentally ill since I was five, so in a way, I don't have many memories of the 'healthy' me, just two years - but boy were they a vivid and awesome two years!  Now, 30 years later, maybe I can pick up where the 4-year-old me stopped growing healthily.  Thank you for your good point, and take care."
AskPsychiatry,fdj59k2,t3_elkfvm,1578458819.0,"Just a quick note to say that I'm following - I'm a 32-year-old woman in Canada with many of the same issues that you mentioned.  I'm not a professional, but very curious as to what one might say to advise you."

May I ask pattern what your rapid cycling takes?  I have seasonal highs and lows; but, within them, my swings are usually every few hours.  I felt blissed out early this morning, then fatigued, then irritable, and now I'm up again.  

Speaking longer-term, I have 'reverse' seasonal depression, in that I feel hypomanic in winter, and an awful mixed state/depression in summer.  Here in the northwest Canadian prairies, the light and heat difference is quite extreme depending on the season - I often say to my close friends that my city's weather is bipolar (and I can say that, mental illness street cred!)

Your husband sounds like an amazing fellow - how wonderful that he sees your sparkling personality shining through your illness.  Take care."
bipolar2,fdgdaae,t1_fdg33zk,1578391260.0,"I agree - I've been diagnosed with bipolar II and OCD - it's an awful mix.  OCD tends to worsen if not addressed and treated, so I'd recommend making an appointment with a psychologist or psychiatrist as soon as you can.

Now that I'm on the right meds, I've reached the point where my OCD only mildly interferes with my life, and I used to wash my hands for 4 or more hours a day.  There is an escape from the frustration it brings.  Good luck and take care."

psychologyresearch,fdewpma,t3_eksf99,1578348187.0,"Hey, really interesting survey, although it shook me up a little.  I'm in remission from anorexia and bulimia, and didn't realize how many low-key symptoms I still have.  

The one question that I had difficulty with was whether I currently suffered from an eating disorder - I put 'yes', but I wish there had been a 'slight yes' or 'slight no' option."
sociopath,fddssi2,t1_fdd9a2u,1578323059.0,"Interesting - do you happen to know any articles or papers that discuss this?  I really enjoy reading this kind of material.

I do have a non-violent history, and have never been arrested for any of my non-violent crimes (mostly picking up hard drugs for years, clean now).  It was only a year ago that, at age 32, I looked up the definition of empathy, and was immediately puzzled.  'People *feel* other people's feelings?', I asked myself at the time, not quite believing what I read.

I do feel empathy for animals; however.  My hypothesis for why this mental discrepancy exists is the abuse and neglect I underwent as a small child.  I believe that I 'shut off' my empathy 'switch' in my brain when it came to relating to humans, as I quickly learned that it was unsafe for me to do so.  Animals never harmed me, so I must have 'kept it on' for them.

I do believe that I'm on this particular spectrum of aspd traits, although I'm not sure that I meet the current definition of it.  I recently read a research paper about the concept of the 'fearful psychopath', which is a term for those people possessing both antisocial and anxious traits, who were uncovered in assessments of the study's sample size.  I look forward to the findings being more widely discussed by the psychological community."

Writing blurbs on reddit and making memes with imgflip to then post on instagram have lead to some really interesting conversations.  And a pet can be nice, if you like animals.
