You are uneasy at this man's presence but have no other option them to wait the storm out till morning. You follow him to a shack that seems worn and has seen many rains. It seems fitting for a old seafaring man like him. Nets and other sea shanties adorn the walls.

^tick ^tick ^tick goes the old battered grandfather clock before chiming the late hour. Before falling silent the old man clears his throat.

""Would you like to hear a legend of the town? It should kill some time at this hour. I won't sleep till dawn anyway"" 

You nod and accept the hot drink warming your cold hands around the tin mug. It was probably gonna be a tall tale. 

""Now not everyone believes it's a legend, some people think there is some truth to the story, others dislike the entire thing. But all have had at least once seen this legend."" 
His voice is crusty, you take a sip of the brew given. It tastes nothing like coffee or anything your used to. You try not to sputter and force it down. Your reaction however makes the man laugh. 

"" I guess I should have lessened the whiskey in yours. Not many can handle the drink."" He takes the drink from your hands and pours it into his own cup before handing you a fresh bit. 

""There, should be lesser now. No whiskey."" 

With a tentive eye you take a sip. It's less harsh and more sweet. Like honey mixed with flowers. Tea maybe? Whatever it is the scent is pleasent. He waits for you to take a few more sips and eat some of the biscuit in front of you. 

"" the legend of the town. They say there's a mermaid. One powerful enough to cause seas to storm. Some say there's a group. Either way, it only storms until the story is told to the newcomer,"" he coughs and clears his throat,"" once a long time ago there was a woman on this island who was made of ocean and sea foam. The one thing all the stories agree on was her eyes of storm. They flashed like silver lightning. But was scorned by many for her unusual beauty. She had always been that way. She had skin paler then death. But sung like the wind. You see these where different times. Much darker times. They thought her as a witch and branded her as such. She was a innocent soul. Much like you and I. One day a huge storm rolled in and brought a stranger from a shipwreck. She saw him and nursed him back to health. Away from the prying eyes of the people. She fell in love with the stranger. All was good for a while. They together lived as partners if not lovers. Till one day the people found out. And killed him. Being devastated, she threw herself into the ocean to drown. Only she ended up morphing into a half fish that looks for her lost lover. But causes a storm when theres some one who washes ashore trapping them here.in hopes that they be the man she loved. Some say they had a child other say she drowned it with her. I'm sorry there isn't much detail to the story."" 

""That's fine, I've been chasing stories for years. But why do you think they killed him?"" 

""Rumors say he had a child with another woman, or left her behind but the townsfolk killed him to hurt her. No one knows really.""

He shrugs and looks out the window. You do as well. But see a woman bobbing out in the distance. She dives under and a tail fin flips up. 

Maybe the story is true. Maybe there are mermaids after all.. *"
