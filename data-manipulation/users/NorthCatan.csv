gaming,ffhgjdt,t1_ffhbl0g,1579934280.0,"As long as there are people who own one console and not the others there will always be console wars.

 I am fortunate enough to have a ps4 pro, xbox one x, and a nintendo switch and to me they are just machines, the only thing I care about and might give loyalty to is the developers of great games.

I like the Ps4 for it's single player exclusives, xbox for multiplayer games and multiplatform games, and switch for couch coop games. People who pledge loyalty to one console and renounce others due to loyalty are simply missing out on a different gaming experience. If it is a matter of spending that's another matter entirely, but it's silly when people renounce something when they hardly know a thing about the various platforms.

Tldr: being bias makes you miss out on gaming experiences."

worldnews,fffkgka,t1_ffenup1,1579885902.0,"I'm not an expert, but the lockdown seems the best option at the moment to prevent people from travelling, but as others have said they need to provide people with more information and regularly do so, and do everything they can to assure them that all the necessary staff and resources are available. That said it seems the CCP so far has done the opposite if news reports and first hand reports are to be believed, for there are videos circulating of hospitals severely full and resources running out, not just in hospitals but in grocery stores. Given that it is the state's duty to prepared in such an event hopefully they have thorough logistical measures for locking the cities down and taking care of its citizens. From what I understand developing a cure can take months and if the state doesn't help fully in a time like this most people won't be able to survive months when everyone is trying to get food and stock up on it."
worldnews,fffjguo,t1_ffeu9s8,1579885278.0,"I can already see them making a decision along the lines of announcing to the public that stores have restocked then everyone rushing to the store for supplies and inevitably speeding up the spread of the virus. Dependency on others to procure food is convenient but definitely a negative in scenarios like this where simply going to the store is taking a big risk, hopefully they can figure out a safe solution on providing food to the people and not increasing further spread of the virus."

worldnews,ffejqzt,t3_et48zi,1579850883.0,"The article has a photo of empty shelves in a grocery store. I think hunger will be a major issue for those in the cities that are locked down and there might be rioting and violence when it comes to attaining food products when the stores restock and the supply will be limited and the demand very high as people will hoard food. People have been reporting that some retailers have been hiking prices too which is terrible, but predictable."
worldnews,ffejabs,t3_et5ms8,1579850316.0,I was listening to global news and they interviewed a virologist and he made a good argument on why lockdowns and such have a negative consequence to them. The consequence being that it creates fear in the population and leads people to keeping their medical ailment secret instead of reporting it and getting aid. The virologist also pointed out how when previous epidemics were rampant such as the spanish flu people didn't take the proper procedures due to fear of alienation or persecution and was one of the reasons it became so rampant. Hopefully this generation is more educated and we can get through this without it becoming a serious global pandemic.
