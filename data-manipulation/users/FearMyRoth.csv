Whatever you were dealing with was **NOT** GHB. GHB exists as a waxy sodium salt and an active dose is about 2 grams; think a few squares of a Hershey's chocolate bar. Even that amount mixed with alcohol is actually not all that unpleasant -many would mix these on purpose. You need maybe double that with a profound amount of alcohol to cause the vomiting I mentioned - the passing out would be more from being black out drunk than anything else. Once dissolved in a liquid context, the volume needed to be added to a drink for an active dose would be as large as 4 or so ounces and, yes, it would be like adding a few tsp of salt to a drink. We used to mix pure GHB into orange juice using a microwave and the taste was unbearable in even \~200mL of liquid. You'd hold your nose as you drank it. 

All of this is easily verifiable on sites like erowid along with the fairly facile synthesis of the drug itself. Shame it's so hard to find these days, it was a rather pleasant if inconvenient alternative to drinking."

This has more to do with simple geographic and climatic facts than anything else. Canada is a far more urban society than the USA.

It's simply unrealistic to expect rural infrastructure in Canada to support the massive majority of the country where almost nobody lives. 

You seem to be working from a series of personal anecdotes instead of evidence that supports the experiences of the actual populations of these countries.
