motorcycles,ffetp7k,t1_ffetnbs,1579865058.0,I agree with you too definitely could be waived if the US wants to. But most of my replies here we’re about people saying diplomatic immunity as a concept is bullshit. As a concept is really important to how nations interact
motorcycles,ffetkji,t1_ffet78g,1579864887.0,Well I’m not sure what happen in this picture case I’m trying to talk more about the global reasons to have diplomatic immunity
motorcycles,ffet78q,t1_ffeslpn,1579864385.0,DI applies to dependents.  You could arrest someone's teenager to get to them. Same with spouses.
motorcycles,ffeswg4,t1_ffesu5z,1579863971.0,So what. You could harass or intimidate the diplomats by attacking his or her family that’s why family members have diplomatic immunity
motorcycles,ffeslvc,t1_ffesk02,1579863560.0,And they released him in about a day....
motorcycles,ffesi7n,t1_ffesbh7,1579863414.0,Exactly.  Someone else studied International Relations :-)
motorcycles,ffesgsw,t1_ffese1w,1579863360.0,"Again, you are looking at is from a very simple viewpoint.

What happens when Russia creates a fake traffic accident, with a 'death' and they use that to arrest a UK diplomat?  That is why DI exists.  You must accept the good with the bad."
motorcycles,ffes03g,t1_ffertle,1579862693.0,"That is not the point. DI is for big things, not simple.  Let's say Russia wants to jail (and then torture and extract info) from a UK diplomat in Moscow. They 'set up' a fake traffic accident where someone is killed.  While this is obviously not the case in this tragic accident, if you start making exceptions to DI between the US and the UK, Russia, China, Iran, etc will do the same to our diplomats. Nothing happens in a vacuum."
motorcycles,fferw00,t3_et88vn,1579862525.0,"Try to understand why DI exists. This is a sad case, but you don't upend centuries of diplomatic process for one family, as sad as it is.

DI protects UK, American, etc diplomats (and their families) so they can do their job and not fear unjust arrest or harassment. For example, you are a defense attache for the UK in China and you (staying within the rules for such job) legally observe a military parade or look outside a ship building facility.  Without DI, the Chinese could arrest you, or arrest your spouse.  Trust me Russia and China would do this in a second, they already harass Western Diplomats. 

So in this case it seems harsh, but there is no way it will be violated by the US and the UK is cutting off it's nose to spite it's face here. Look at the history of the UK and the shit pulled by their diplomats, starting coup d'etats (Iran, 1950s)."
motorcycles,fferp4w,t1_ffepwhb,1579862241.0,"Wrong, It is the cornerstone of international relations. Try to see the Forrest through the Tree. DI exists to protect all diplomats from persecution and harassment. The UK knows this very well. For example, if you have UK diplomat attending a democracy event in Russia, without DI he could be arrested and harassed."
