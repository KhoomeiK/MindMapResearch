holdmyfeedingtube,ffgpro7,t1_ffgkv1l,1579911957.0,"It's kinda doomed either way. You either get mods who started the sub and don't have the time or energy to constantly refresh new and delete this shit or you get power user mods who are absolutely atrocious people. Reddit is fundamentally flawed because it preys on the same dopamine response that twitter/facebook do with fake internet points that even when ultimately meaningless leads your average-below average knuckle dragger to post this shit in every sub that it loosely applies to for some of those points. Pretty much every sub with a good concept is destined to either become overly censored, overly politicized, flooded with loosely-related cross-posts, or a meme cesspit. I don't think there really is an answer to solving it."

Servers like KR don't have this problem because duo queuing is looked down on and streaming isn't the end game of getting higher ranked.

leagueoflegends,fejiy9z,t1_fei5oh9,1579176263.0,"""Duhhh NA would never organically produce viable talent if it weren't flooded with imports hurrrr""

The OG c9 5 being officially gone takes that story out with them. What was even more special was that none of those players were ever considered particularly impressive enough for top teams to pick up (except turtle way back before the LCS run). Most of them were members of orbit, a team that barely made it onto the main stage and fizzled out in quarters. Meteos, 1 of the 2 non-orbit members was pretty much a complete nobody and sneaky (the other non orbit) had played really only online tourneys. That squad went on to produce the most internationally successful team in NA's history, even if they imported later on the full domestic squad was no joke. Makes me sad to see that we never had another and never will due to the corporate nature of esports today. 

So to me it really signifies the death of hope for true domestic talent. Unfortunate parallels to starcraft."

Clicked through studies continue to see nothing suggesting a long-term timeframe. Love when people with clearly no agenda link the same 12 studies to every point trying to pull a gotcha.
