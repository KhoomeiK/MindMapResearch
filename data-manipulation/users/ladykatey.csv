HistoricalCostuming,fffmv9g,t3_et9c3k,1579887377.0,"There are a huge range of garments classified as “corsets,” so it’s hard to make generalized statements for or against them."
foodhacks,ffeecbr,t3_et1igp,1579844849.0,"Muffin pan quiches with vegetables in them. Frozen vegetables work fine with eggs, since a softer texture harmonizes with the egg texture better. So think a bag of frozen mixed diced peppers and onions, and a bag of frozen spinach, and a dozen eggs, and some seasonings and some cheese, you can make a dozen servings of breakfast/snack/lunch that tastes good room temp or warmed up. Just remember to use a good amount of spray (or oil rubbed on with a paper towel) on the pans."
foodhacks,ffedxq9,t1_ffecz7r,1579844451.0,"These kind of things: https://www.amazon.com/Axe-Sickle-Silicone-Insulation-Resistant/dp/B01M3P777X/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=silicone+pinch+grip&qid=1579844178&s=home-garden&sr=1-12

They're also good for opening small jars when you need a better grip.


I suppose the ultimate version of this hack would be to use a smaller stainless steel mixing bowl that can sit over the top of the pan, so the steam melts the butter, and then you can put the drained pasta and cheesy powder in the bowl, and also eat out of the bowl."
foodhacks,ffediyx,t1_ffebxod,1579844050.0,"Looking closer at the noodles I think you're right and this hack is pretty good. You do have to wash that glass measuring cup now, but I guess that's a little easier than a cheesey-sauced pan."

sewing,ffat48p,t3_eshr5q,1579743869.0,"Go by the bust measurement, in a style like this the hipmeasurement is useless. I’d ask to see the back of the envelope, there are probably other measurements given like waist and bodice length. And maybe info about ease. It would be good to know if the bodice is boned or if you are expected to wear a girdle under it, because then the size would be based on your girdled measurements."

AskReddit,ffaorrs,t1_ff8ycad,1579740958.0,I think “Fast-casual” has contributed too. Why pay $14 for a sit down burger as fries  at Ruby Tuesdays when you can get one just as good at Five Guys for $11 and bus your own table?

AskReddit,ff8i7tv,t3_es8u7f,1579679651.0,"I started off in this particular hobby almost 4 years ago. Made a lot of friends, and had a lot of good times. Even started thinking about taking on admin roles. But over the past month a new drama started and an old drama has been reignited. I'm hesitant to take sides, because THIS IS WHAT I DO ON WEEKENDS FOR FUN. Am I an asshole for not being willing to spend my free time on hobby politics? Or how do I stay interested in the hobby in general while these bullshit debates are going on?"

In bed just looking at my phone, I’ll doze off until 1 am and then get up and be awake and sew with the tv on for a few hours and then back for another nap I guess before work? It’s awful.
