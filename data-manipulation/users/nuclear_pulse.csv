fatlogic,ff7n7eu,t1_ff7mefb,1579653576.0,I definitely don't. And I have not reached out to this person because I don't want to send the signal that it's acceptable to treat me (or anyone else) that way. I think I am more upset over the idea that he isn't who I thought he was.
fatlogic,ff7jedl,t3_ervuu1,1579650949.0,"I am late, so not sure if anyone will actually read this, but.....

I am one week out from being stood up by a guy I really like. I am still eating like an asshole. I even know why. My self worth has taken a little hit and it's hard to make good choices when you are struggling with how to value yourself. Been trying to focus on how happy I am that I can finally exercise the way I want after fighting for a year to get a nerve injury healed. I love the me who is strong and dances and hikes and lifts weights. That girl deserves a person who makes good choices for themselves. That girl is the same one I am now, even if it's hard to remember sometimes."
fatlogic,ff5u6dj,t3_ere8ar,1579610367.0,"Who knew that size is a relative thing?

Speaking of, relative to a healthy weight person you are big."
My600lbLife,ff32q8f,t1_fd521lu,1579532146.0,"My mother works in the healthcare field and told me about a relatively new procedure that might be of interest. RF skin therapy encourages collagen production and can tighten skin. It won't be quite as effective as skin surgery, but it's less risky, a bit cheaper, and might give him enough of an improvement to be happy with."
My600lbLife,ff30x0j,t1_fep2fnn,1579530719.0,This will forever be my favorite exchange on this show.
fatlogic,ff2ufmg,t1_ff2grgq,1579524593.0,"You just have to plan. I spend an hour and a half in the car every day getting to and from work. But I also generally get my steps in between I make a point to get up and walk a little bit every so often at work. I can generally get 10,000 steps this way. In addition, i make time for the gym 5-7 days a week.

It's worth it to me because i don't want to live in the middle of the city where i work."
fatlogic,feomk2p,t1_feo14fz,1579302208.0,"This. I've had one bad experience. Most of the men I keep in my life are phenomenal people. While I appreciate the original commenter's sympathy, I definitely didn't want to bash men in this post. :/"
fatlogic,fendrrr,t3_epwfvv,1579282517.0,You can count macros with zero intention of losing weight.
fatlogic,fend08p,t1_fen83k2,1579282056.0,"That's what I keep telling myself. My confidence is a little dinged, but I value myself and my time too much to find behavior like that acceptable. I wouldn't have really even been that upset if he'd told me no or cancelled. It's the fact that he told me yes, changed his mind, and then didn't think it was worth letting me know. Fuck that."
fatlogic,fen0s0p,t3_eq1ksj,1579274406.0,"So. I got stood up on Tuesday night by a guy I really like and that I thought liked me too. I have definitely been sadness eating since then. I've been trying to keep it at maintenance at least, but it's still not a good thing to be doing. It just sucks to feel like you are forgettable and unimportant and to wonder if maybe he wouldn't have done that if I were thinner.

Gotta move on and get back on it I guess."
fatlogic,fe7mkwz,t1_fe5cgp6,1578916543.0,"I was just about to say this exact thing. Math is fun and a 5,000 calorie per day deficit just doesn't add up."
fatlogic,fcxylrx,t3_ejgni9,1578072305.0,"Rant: I compete in Highland Games. There's about a 30/70 split between people are are a bit overweight (crossover with other strengths like strongman), understand effective training and eating, and are generally athletic vs people who are just fat and not especially athletic at all. The second group tends to use the first group as justification. ""These people are also heavy, but look how strong they are!""  This is especially true in the women's division. Sis, the top amateur woman maybe has a BMI around 28 and trains religously. Not the same thing as your 350 lb ass unable to spin to throw weights or you'll destroy your knee. You are not ""all muscle."" You do not eat the same as the lighter, stronger women. You do not train the same. My sport is killing itself because we're all so freaking fat.

Rave: I spent the entirety of last year messing around. No consistency with eating or training, largely compounded by an injury that took most of the year to sort out, and I am up 10 lbs. I feel good, my injury is healed, and I'm feeling more motivation to get going than I have in a long time. I've done really well the last three days. Gym and diet on point. I somehow managed to beat my squat PR that I set more than a year ago before I got hurt (175 lbs for 3!!!) despite how inconsistent my training has been. I can do this!"
fatlogic,fcunyas,t3_ej0fld,1577985027.0,"Just want to clear up that I like Lizzo. Not really shading her necessarily, but she has a lot of FA/HAES fans that are using her as a beacon of fat glory in a pretty unhealthy way."
fatlogic,f87xghj,t1_f86x2t0,1574344545.0,That's actually a thing for some very specific (and isolated) parts of the modern feminist movement.
