And especially with my more extroverted friends I tend to get tired if them quickly. I have one or two friends I can only really tolerate talking to once or twice a month. Nothing against then, I love then and they're good people. Its just too much for me to handle for longer periods of time. 

There's nothing wrong with enjoying being by yourself. Sometimes you're your best company. If you feel yourself getting annoyed try letting them know that you're just not really feeling it today and need some space and that you'll talk when you're feeling better. Some people might pry, but most should be pretty understanding about it.

If you find a good group of friends they'll let you talk to them on your own terms instead of forcing you to be interactive."

People saying it demonizes mental illness. It uses mental illness to justify bad deeds. It shows mental ill people that acting on their illness is a good thing. It shows the general public that mental illness is dangerous and should be feared.

mentalhealth,fek24qa,t1_fejna9k,1579190988.0,"This is one of the few cases I'm ok with mental illness being demonized like this. Because he wasn't made a demon solely because of his mental illness. He started as a human in the movie, and we watched his descent as he was mocked for his struggles, stripped of his resources, and kicked while he was down until he gave into becoming the demon we perceive him to be. We actually get to see why this kind of demonization in the media is a bad thing. We get to see how it can affect people and make horrible situations even worse.

I appreciate how they humanized the villain. They didn't justisfy his actions. They weren't saying he was right for doing what he did. They just explained how he got there. He was still evil, and vile and clearly the bad guy, but I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if just a single person actually cared."

Cats are surprisingly social animals. While they are independent individuals they also enjoy being a part of a group, and groups all have their own ways of communicating and interacting. Those are the things cats mimic usually in an attempt to communicate or integrate with the family.

You may find that cats raised by other cats don't speak as much. Well verbally at least. That's because cats don't use meows to communicate with each other often and instead use body language. Cats raised by humans however are much more likely to screm when they want or need something because that's how humans communicate.

I inadverdently taught my cat a human specific meow. When she was a kitten everytime I communicated with her or wanted her attention I would scream ""Meowwooooooooo."" It was a joke because my dog never talks so I was going to ""teach our kitten to howl"" ...and it worked. That was the only way she would speak until she met other cats.

Itll help long term, but if she has incredibly long nails doing it only this way without them being trimmed a good bit first will take quite a long time to get them down to a reasonable length.

This includes cats, raccoons, foxes, spiders, some deer and snakes, but also a multitude of other animals."

mentalhealth,fc7dqaz,t3_egisf7,1577504408.0,"Same here my dude. My name in high school was ""The Overachiever"" everyone expected me to go to medical school and become some kind of a doctor or follow in my brothers footsteps and be a nurse. I never wanted any of that, I've been suicidal since a disturbingly young age, and only did my best because I thought if could just leave my parents things could get better.

When I went to college, things weren't so bad to start. I'd gotten a handle on my social anxiety which I didn't even know was a thing. I was away enough from my parents that I could actually enjoy myself for once. My professors were cool, my classes were fun, I was excelling and making friends. But then shit went sideways.

Next thing I knew, I never left my dorm anymore. I only ever ate on weekends when my mother or her friend dragged me out for dinner. I was falling apart and there was nothing I could do about it anymore. I went from a 4.0 GPA being on the deans list and fast passing myself to graduating Summa Cum Laude to being put on academic suspension because I had failed all of my classes with a 0.2.

My parents forced me to go back at the local junior college instead, but that just made things worse. I ended up dropping out all together, ran away from home, became a disgrace to my family, and every time I see my parents I can see how embarrassed they are to associate with me. Its always ""when are you going back to school"" ""You should take classes again"" ""When are you coming home?"" ""You can't keep doing this."" I hate it. I feel like a failure. I could have been so much better, but instead I've spent the past 5 years of my life picking up the pieces.

All of that said though, dropping out and running away was the best decision I've ever made. I was lucky enough to find the help I needed and the people to support me through the hardest time of my life. I'm doing so much better now. Some days I can even take care of myself just fine. I have a full time office job with benefits that pays more than even some of my friends that did graduate. I plan on going back and getting my degree eventually, but for right now I'm focusing on getting myself better.

Its ok to feel like your going no where, or that you'll never get anywhere. That's what the journey feels like. It took me 5 years to learn that you never really know if you've moved forward until you're far enough to look back at where you've started. Even then, I'm no where 100% ok yet. Its a process, but do keep in mind that it can be hard to find a treatment that works for you especially when it comes to mental health. Just like how not all meds work for everyone. If you haven't already, talk to your treatment team about other options.

I hope you the best"
