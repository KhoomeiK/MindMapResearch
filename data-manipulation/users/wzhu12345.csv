Remember that there is no secret formula for happiness. Just because your life looks fine from the outside doesn’t mean you’re *supposed* to be happy. No one is supposed to be happy. You’re not expected to have a gf either, and you shouldn’t expect a gf to instantly make you instantly happier. You could try to focus more on your personal connections and relationships, but remember that deep, emotional, fulfilling connections can take time."
SuicideWatch,ff0zwij,t3_er3dfa,1579473888.0,"Have you tried counseling? If you’re having thoughts like this, you could try going to a therapist. Remember, a lot of people are struggling through similar thoughts even though they may also look fine on the outside. You’re not alone."
SuicideWatch,ff0yu73,t3_er3dw1,1579473626.0,Try to spend time with her tonight. Make sure she’s not lonely and not about to do something dangerous.
SuicideWatch,ff0yh1y,t3_er3g2j,1579473504.0,"Could you try hanging out with your sisters friends or your brothers friends? Try not to overthink whether you’re coming across as too weak or unconfident. Just try to be yourself when you meet people. Most people appreciate a nice person. If they try to use you, then those aren’t the people you want to be friends with. Maybe try talking to your gf more about your insecurities. She might be very understanding, and opening up could help you guys get closer."
SuicideWatch,fex7ugb,t1_fex71ue,1579426434.0,"It can be hard to find the right friends. If those past friends ignored you and your depression, then, as you said, those aren't really your friends. And it can be easy to blame yourself when that happens, but you really shouldn't. But also keep in mind that friendship is a two-way relationship, and you should make sure to support and care for your friends as much as you want them to support and care for you. In fact, caring for someone else can be one of the most rewarding and fulfilling things you can do."
SuicideWatch,fex77pt,t3_eqtk3l,1579425819.0,"No one is ""supposed to be happy."" If you feel depressed, then you feel depressed. Don't let anyone, including yourself, trivialize your feelings. There is no secret formula for happiness. Just because you have everything that you thought would make you happen doesn't mean that you're supposed to be happy. Talk to your wife or your parents about your feelings. They care about you. Your wife doesn't want to be ""free of your shit."" She wants you to be happy."
SuicideWatch,fex6sbl,t3_eqtrel,1579425540.0,Your friends are your friends because they love you and care about you. Don't be afraid to open up to them. They will listen. Remember that many people share your thoughts. That might include some of your friends.
SuicideWatch,fex6i3e,t3_eqtt3d,1579425339.0,"Don't disillusion yourself with false expectations. 16 is an impossibly difficult time of your life. No one is ""thriving"" at 16. High school is hard. Although it might seem like everyone is living their best life, most people are struggling too. I struggled with loneliness a lot and I still do. Having lots of friends and going to parties is not expected at all. Quality over quantity. Those 3 to 4 people are really all you need. Talk to them because they care about you. Talk to your family because they care about you. Although you might not feel loved, trust me when I say that the people in your life love you, and you should tell them how you're feeling. And remember: death is PERMANENT."
SuicideWatch,fex5u1u,t3_eqtvod,1579424948.0,"You are not a burden to your friends and family. Don't let your mind trick you. You family and friends love you, and they want to help you. Reach out to them. Tell them how you're feeling."
SuicideWatch,fex51yv,t3_eqrqrm,1579424515.0,"You deserve to be loved. Everyone deserves to be loved. The path to self-love is difficult, but it's one we all have to take before things get better. Don't fall into the self-hate. Don't do it."
