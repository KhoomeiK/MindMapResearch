roblox,ff8amak,t3_es5v4o,1579671031.0,"Pretty much every genre would be positively affected by VR. Militaries and fighting games like PF? Now you have to realistically reload your gun, deal with recoil, and aim down sights. Roleplay? Now we don't have to think of everything a player would want to do and simply make an interactable environment and interact with others (hopefully with ample moderation, seeing as some people would use this to do, well, you know.) just to name one situation. VR is widely sought-after and enjoyed because, in my mind, it gives you much more freedom to interact with the world around you and, in some cases, it feels like you're actually there.   


With that being said, however, I don't believe that Roblox VR could ever become giant. This is because the vast majority of Roblox players either don't care/know about VR, can't get one for a host of reasons, including Roblox mostly being marketed to children.  


All & all, I believe Roblox VR is an excellent idea but is sadly on the wrong type of platform. The optimal situation for a similar thing where players build VR experiences for other players like in Roblox would be a game, or rather an engine, as is more suitable to call Roblox, where it is marketed to adults, preferably wealthier and a studio environment specifically designed for VR, as well as frameworks such as avatars also designed with such intent.
