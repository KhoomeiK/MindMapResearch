For one the argument that yes the medical transition is literally the difference. Maybe that's your point of view that it's a small part of transition but for me my medical transition is almost everything to me. My transition is literally a binary decision I've made to do as much as I can along a certain path. This is significant and comes with its own experiences that are unique.

Also medical transition is fucking huge, it is multiple surgeries ideally, a lot of money, it's years of planning and effort and struggle and calls to insurance and tears. I'm tired of it being downplayed as something small and inconsequential. It's literally the driving force behind my entire life for the past 5 years. This is a difference. Acknowledging that difference is fine.

Buck puts this difference into a difference of labels. just as binary doesn't mean superior to non-binary, in the nomenclature Buck uses transsexual does not mean superior to transgender, it literally is just a more specific phrase he uses to refer to his understanding of his experience.
