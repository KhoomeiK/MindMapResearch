television,fg711en,t1_fg6mm0g,1580581489.0,"Breaking Bad had different directors quite often. Clearly Vince Gilligan is an incredibly talented director, but some of Breaking Bad's best episodes came from other directors. Rian Johnson directed a few, including the episodes ""Ozymandias"" and ""Fly"". Im pretty sure Bryan Cranston directed an episode as well."

aww,ffraxvk,t1_ffqxo32,1580154262.0,"When I was 8 my dad remarried and we moved into my stepmom's house. I brought my cat, but my stepmom was allergic, so the cat had to stay outdoors. The cat didn't like that, so she ended up spending a lot of time at our next door neighbor's home. Our neighbor ended up adopting it, which was fine since we could never let her indoors. I still saw her fairly often, so it was all good.

It's almost 22 years later, and the cat is still there, living the good life."
movies,ffgin53,t3_ethnz0,1579907098.0,"I just watched it again for the third time a couple weeks ago. Everyone's performances are fantastic in it, but Hugh Jackman is absolutely phenomenal. His anger and pain is expressed so perfectly, so deeply, it's unbelievable. One of the darkest and most emotional movies I've ever seen. Every time I watch it I feel so emotionally drained at the end, but it's so good.

Also, I totally forgot Denis Villeneuve directed it! He's one of the few directors I will go out of my way to see everything they make. He's brilliant."
