AskDocs,ffvxoma,t3_evhu49,1580276482.0,"1. If your dr tells your mom anything about your health without your consent REPORT THEM.

2. You can tell you are pregnant IF your doctor orders a blood test beta hcg. They can not run a blood test without an order. They could do a urine test but I doubt they would do that.

3. That's too early for you to have pregnancy symptoms

4. Go buy some pregnancy tests. I personally found that they all worked for me. All of them even dollar store tests but not everyone has found that. Buy a couple. 

If you are pregnant - just based on a couple of estimations with the info you provided. It would be very early. In approximately week 3 (but week 1 and week 2 don't actually really exist, week 3 is when implantation happens). It could take a few days for you to test positive. 

But it doesn't seem like you have a 28 day cycle so the math will be a little off. And even if you have a regular cycle things can vary every once in awhile."

Not sure which justno sub it was but someone thought/said their SO drugged them, while they were on a cruise with their SO family etc etc. And people tore that person apart. I mean - I hope what happened isn't true there but if it is. We really did a disservice to the OP

I understand that.

I'm sorry you're going through that

Just remember this adult man, was being much more childish than you. He purposely destroyed your property. That isn't something he should have ever done. And he was proud of it. He has likely done this to other people. Hopefully your actions have caused him to reevaluate his need to torment children - teens. 

He isn't a good person. And I personally, can not blame you for what happened to him. What you have written here and before. He deserved this.

You tried. He did not. The only person who had the right to destroy your bike, is you. Just remember that.

Not everyone is this malicious but this ""man"" is. There is something wrong with him for him to do these things.


But watch your back for retaliation from him or his son. If this incident didn't set him straight. He will essentially let it fuel him, like fire, as he thinks of a way to settle the score."

I'm not sure about tampons. But recently I had a miscarriage and they said if you go through more than 2 pads an hour for more than 2 hours go to the er

Long story short - I hemorrhaged and like you it was fine when I was sitting/laying but standing up it essentially all came out. 


How long has that amount of bleeding been happening?"

AskDocs,fftcwhe,t3_ev38zn,1580216772.0,"How heavy is the bleeding? How often are you changing tampons at this point. Do you take birth control pills?

It's possible the tampon essentially acted like a cork and now you're basically emptying out... 

If you take tylenol for cramping that can mask a fever

Advil, naproxen and aspirin can as well.

You should go see your doctor, or even just call them and see what they think. 

Just incase you did get an infection. It could be a different one than the one that causes TSS."

CautiousBB,ffs9j6h,t1_ffs6v6z,1580176444.0,"That's why I mentioned numbers. USA and Canada sometimes measure things differently. Like blood glucose is hugely different between our countries.

I got 1 iron transfusion in an attempt to avoid a blood transfusion but next day my hgb went from 70 to 67 so I got a blood transfusion 

Brought it it up 81 the next day and was able to leave the hospital. 

2 weeks later(last week) my hgb was up to 109 so that's a lot better. And my other numbers are a mess but I have no idea what they were in the hospital.

Don't recommend that experience to anyone"
CautiousBB,ffs61f3,t3_eux2f3,1580174020.0,"Talk to your doctor about it

There are reasons to take baby aspirin while pregnant.

When I was pregnant - I have high blood pressure and have since I was 14. I was told to start taking 2 baby aspirin by my OB. And if/when I get pregnant again. To start talking it as soon as I know.

It is used to help prevent preeclampsia which certain people are at higher risk for (like already having high bp)

My OB and 2 other OBs confirmed this during my miscarriage when discussing current meds. 

BUT IT CAN INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE so don't just take it unless the dr tells you. It is ""safe"" in smaller doses. But too high of a dose can cause problems. I was on BP meds - I can't go off them and it increased my bp a bit on meds.

Oh edit:  I was told to take it for the entire pregnancy - I'm not sure what we will do in a second pregnancy because omg did I ever hemorrhage during the miscarriage. 
(Canadian in case numbers are different) My hemoglobin went from 128 to 67 (these were the only numbers I was given during the hospital stay)"

We waited about a week. After everything. It was something we kind of needed and it had been awhile. I was still bleeding a little.
It was fine, and good for me. And he didn't have any issue. But only had sex 1x. And then waited until the 2 weeks was up before having sex again

But I'm not saying you should do it. You are at risk for infection.  That was about 2 weeks ago. Everything is fine now it seems and no issues after. But that's my experience."

Temping is the only way to confirm that you ovulated but opks are decent they show a progression and you can assume you ovulated."

Today I called my dr to schedule a pap because it's been a few years since I had one. And she didn't want to do it while pregnant. Just incase I miscarried. Not that paps cause miscarriage just that, it would be one of those things that might sit in the back of my head. 
Making the appointment made me cry. I didn't feel upset before calling.
