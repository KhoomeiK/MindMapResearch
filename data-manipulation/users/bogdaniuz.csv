todayilearned,ffvgtzy,t1_ffvamle,1580263792.0,"I assume you're talking about your experience but to share some of mine H1-b is not  only used for some blatant exploitation of poor immigrants who can't do better.

In my country, IT sector is fairly thriving and everyone working here is making a shitton of money. Like a good back-end devloper earns around 3-4k usd a month when the average salary in the country is 400-500 usd depending on the city.

Many of the companies here are actually subsidiaries of the American businesses though, so they offer h1-b visas for the employees who want to have an opportunity to work in the United States to stack their CV or just for experience or a marginally larger pay.

I am saying that these are kind of people who are more likely to move back to their own country if they are going to take a lot of shit and abuse in the US branch. So it's not all that one-sided

However, it is true, that they offer those visas cause usually h1-b guys are willing to work for less than American devs"

Art,ffpoc5e,t1_ffpnib0,1580100234.0,"I mean, people grieve over the deaths of fictional characters, how's that any different?

Besides, ""Celebrity"" is kind of a monolithic descriptor. I'd assume that for many people Kobe was not just a good NBA player, but he was someone to look up to, an inspiration in sport and in other parts of life. Hell, perhaps some people had been more personally touched by them (maybe they directly benefited from his philanthropic foundation, etc.) and his death was like a loss of a sliver of their own life.

I understand that there might be people who might attempt to relate to the tragedy for some personal clout, but, honestly, I think that gatekeeping emotions or telling people that they should not grieve or that they should grieve in some more appropriate manner is a fairly pointless endeavor."

Games,ffafig7,t1_ffacntd,1579734536.0,"Perhaps we're arguing semantics but I don't think that that what makes a person mythical or not, does it? 

For me, mythical characters, creatures, etc. are always closely related to the dubious historical origins. That is, it is either really hard to prove that such person or event existed (e.g Trojan War and the character of Achilles) or something like that could not have existed at all (mythical creatures like Chimera, Pegasus, etc.) 

As far as I understand, with Guan Yu we have some historical records which prove that he did in fact exist (please correct me on this one if I'm wrong). So, I just believe that deification does not make a person a myth, but that might just be splitting hairs. Like Tsar Nicholas II is deified in Russian Orthodox tradition but we don't really call him a myth.

---

All in all the bigger issue for me here is that even if we accept that Guan Yu can be considered a mythical character, he is the one who existed in distinct chronological period. So it just makes me curious about the timeline (as in relation to real time) in which Hades takes place because the answer to that question can create many interesting discussions about the plot points and the rules of the game's universe."

Games,ff9b6s6,t1_ff7le7f,1579708981.0,"My main issue with Guan Yu spear is that he's not mythical figure but a historical one.

So unless some time fuckery is implied (as in Guan Yu is yet to be born in Hades world but also he is already born because Fates are predetermined), that means that Hades takes place in AD, which creates some interesting questions and implications.

Like Iliad was allegedly written by homer in 6-7 centuries BC, which means that Trojan War took place even earlier than that. So the current state of Achiles and Patrocles relationship in the game becomes interesting given that they had been going at it for more than 600 years? Or the time just flows and is perceived differently when you're dead or something."

I have to say, this has been one of the best gaming experiences I've had in 2019. Not only I like this style of music, but this game has been oddly...emotional? The plot is very loose and is told mainly through symbolisms and loose threads here and there but after playing through the game for three times, I cannot help but shed a tear each time I am playing through the finale. 

I guess it touches me on some kind of subliminal level, that story of a heartbreak and recovering from it, which is told in such beautiful and mesmerizing way. Queen Latifah's narration is just sweet icing on the cake.

Also, sidenote: I wish that album mode (which you unlock after first completion) would have been available from the start. That is definitely the way that the game should be enjoyed, as I felt that separation into stages (with some of them being overtly short) just pulls you out of the moment in an unspectacular way"
