AskReddit,ffi3qps,t3_etripo,1579964215.0,"My dad cheated and left my mom and me (when I was 11) to go live with his new SO (across the country). He left right after we sold our home, so that left my mom with no home, a bunch of furniture, and me. He also tried to go to court to take my mom's money and made her life a living hell. He constantly tried to avoid paying for my child support and he would disrespect my mom in different ways (tell others her secrets and just say she was a bad wife).

Ever since I matured enough to realize the depth of the situation, I grew extremely loyal to my mom and cut contact with my dad and his side of the family (grandparents, aunt, and uncle never called after the incident anyways). My mom worked her ass off to make sure I live a comfortable and amazing life with a single parent. Her and I went through hard times together and came our stronger and loving each other more. I'm extremely thankful for having such a phenomenal mom, and couldn't care less about my father."
