TheExpanse,ffc2s2v,t1_ffbll4l,1579790107.0,"This theory doesn't hold up because the ringbuilders tried this strategy and it didn't save them. They shut down their own network to try and come up with a new strategy or technology that would allow them to defeat the goths and eventually rebuild their network, but they were killed before they could do so."

>!“We’re in a lot of trouble, aren’t we?” Holden asked, breathless.

>!“Nah,” Miller said, rotating the robot to test the air in every direction with its tentacles. “This is just initial material sorting and reclamation. Not even to the processing center.”

>!“You could park a battleship in this room.”

>!“It’s not for show,” Miller said, then the robot began scuttling toward a distant wall. “This is the point of this planet.”

>!“Huh,” Holden said. He found he was missing all of his other words. “Huh.”

>!“Yeah. So, as far I can figure it, there are minerals native to this system that are fairly rare, galactically speaking.”

>!“Lithium.”

>!“That’s one,” Miller agreed. “This planet is a gas station. Process the ore, refine it, send it down to the power plants, then beam the collected energy out.”

>!“To where?”

>!“To wherever. There are lots of worlds like this one, and they all fed the grid. Not the rings, though. I still don’t know how they powered those.”

>!The robot moved with machine speed toward a distant wall, and a section of the structure slid away. It left an opening the size of a repair shuttle, and more lighted machinery beyond. Some of the giant devices were moving with articulations more biological than mechanical. They pulsed, contracted, rippled. Nothing so prosaic and common as a gear or a wheel in sight.

>!“Are we moving through a fusion reactor right now?” Holden asked, Naomi’s question about radiation exposure on his mind.

>!“Nope. This is just ore processing. The reactors are all in that chain of islands on the other side of the world. These guys built for flexibility and redundancy.”

>!“You know,” Holden said, “one of the geologists told me this planet has been heavily modified. All of that was done just to turn it into a power station?”

>!“Why not? They didn’t need it for anything else. Not a particularly good planet, rare metals aside. And be glad they did. You think you can have an underground rail system last two billion years on any planet with tectonic action?”

>!Holden was quiet for a moment, riding the Miller-bot through the material refining plant as it throbbed around him. “It’s too much,” he finally said. “That level of control over your environment is too much. I can’t get my brain around it. What could kill these guys?”

>!“Something worse.”"

You take a 5-10% hit in frames, but have just as many cores, PCI-E 4.0, a cooler CPU, and increased speed in things like rendering and multitasking."
TheExpanse,femxlbv,t3_epycn7,1579272234.0,"Ships won't spent a lot of time at 1 g, they'll usually travel at .3g or lower to both make the journey more pleasant, and to reduce reaction mass use.

The formula for delta V in a Brachistochrone trajectory is 2 * sqrt(distance * acceleration). 

To travel 1 au (150m km) at 1g, your ship needs to have a delta V of 2 * sqrt (150000000000*9.8) = 2424871.13m/s

To travel the same distance at .3g, your delta V is 2 * sqrt (150000000000*3.26) = 1398570.7m/s. Significantly reduced."
facepalm,fejrdvf,t1_fejoj1s,1579183947.0,"Humans use base 10 for a lot more things than just distance, weight, and volume. It makes sense to standardize it. Halving or doubling is easier in imperial, but the real strength of metric is it's conversion.

If you have 357 oz, how many gallons do you have? Well I know that there are 128 oz in a gallon, and a simple multiple of 128 is 256. That leaves 357-256 = 101 oz of a remainder. So 2 gallons 101 oz. But 101 oz is still a lot, so I can convert those to pints. I know 5*16 = 96, so we have 2 gallons, 5 pints, 5 oz.

If I have 3576ml of water, how many liters do I have? 3.576L, or 3L & 576ml. It's so much easier to convert between values of the same measurement."
facepalm,fejql53,t1_fejm88l,1579183352.0,"I'm going to chalk that up to proximity to the united states. A lot of our goods and products come from there, so naturally they'll have imperial measurements listed first and foremost. Of course they include metric in brackets, but if the recipe you look up online uses Fahrenheit and ounces, your ingredient comes in imperial measurements like 1lb bags of sugar, and your measuring cups only do intervals of 50ml but also go to 1/8th of a cup, you're going to default to think in imperial for baking."

Now, it was the geographical heart of Luna’s largest metropolis, though you wouldn’t have been able to tell that from space. Luna boasted very few actual domes. The constant rain of micro-meteors turned a dome into a randomly firing atmosphere ejection port.

> Posthuman. It was a word that came up in the media every five or six years, and it meant different things every time. Neural regrowth hormone? Posthuman. Sex robots with inbuilt pseudo intelligence? Posthuman. Self-optimizing network routing? Posthuman. It was a word from advertising copy, breathless and empty, and all he’d ever thought it really meant was that the people using it had a limited imagination about what exactly humans were capable of.

Tiamat's Wrath:
>They were silent and perfectly still. Duarte looked up, his attention caught by something that made him smile like a child seeing a dragonfly, and his hands rose aimlessly. Trejo put the scanner down on the bed, turned, and walked quietly out of the room, pulling Elvi along with him. Ilich followed, and then Kelly, shutting the door behind them. They were all pale. The State Building was shaking under them, tremors that matched Elvi’s heartbeat. She fought to breathe.

>   “All right,” Ilich said. “Okay. That happened. That just happened.”

>  “Major Okoye?” Trejo said. His normally dark face was pale and gray.

Babylon's Ashes:
>   This was how they’d end now. A long, desperate race to see who ran out of PDC rounds or torpedoes first. Who had allies near enough to complicate the situation. But before any of that, there was the braking threshold. The point of no return at which they wouldn’t have enough reaction mass left to match the thrust they’d already pumped into their vector. They’d be trapped in a desperately long orbit, at the mercy of whoever came for them.

  That was her hard deadline.

>The formaldehyde taste in her mouth was heavy and chemical. They were out of PDC range, but that was only convention. PDC rounds didn’t magically evaporate or slow down. Every tungsten slug that hadn’t hit its target in battle was still out there in the black somewhere, speeding on as fast as the moment it had left the barrel. It was only the overwhelming vastness of space that kept every ship out there from being holed at random.

There are no 'takers' because the the terraforming project is so massive that they can't afford anyone to coast off the government. We also learn that on mars, job placement by the government after graduation is common. Better hope you like atmospheric chemistry, cause that's where they're sending you.
