AskReddit,ffyofgl,t1_ffyhflc,1580351261.0,Exactly. Legacy format is hella expensive to play so the 10k thing is eh
AskReddit,ffycer0,t1_ffxa9m8,1580343092.0,"Whitening toothpastes are more abrasive so it wouldn't be wise to use it for too long.  I always recommend patients to use a prescription strength fluoride toothpaste prior to whitening. Or use something that has a low abrasive index like arm n hammer toothpaste or Sensodyne. Also, please remember that Sensodyne only works if you leave it on the tooth. Spit but don't rinse it off."
AskReddit,ffwpzos,t1_ffvq7pa,1580308178.0,"It can cause sensitivity, yes. My dentist always wants me to promote whitening but I am very against it since it causes sensitivity. Do you want white teeth and to feel electrocuted everytime air touches your teeth? I think it demineralizes your enamel or something. It does expose your teeth's dentinal tubes. I'm sorry I'm not explaining well I'm very sleep deprived."

TwoXChromosomes,ffem9e9,t3_et1e9b,1579854152.0,"What the fuck kind of person calls you out on your rape?! I do think those two are VERY  separate terms. And no, it is no one's right or business to correct you!!! What the damn hell. I'm flabbergasted that someone had the gall to attempt to correct you on your rape and losing your virginity. And it is very brave of you to even post a question about this. I would not have the balls to do so. Fuck the people who try to correct you on when you lost your virginity."

AskReddit,fcupmug,t3_eixc75,1577985976.0,Met my fiancee on okcupid 4 years ago. We clicked instantly. Had the same interests and similar views on things. We dated for 6 months before moving in together. I had been single for 5 years prior to that and did online dating for about 3. He was on there for maybe a month. I thought it was pretty fun
