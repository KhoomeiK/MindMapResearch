Indeed, many so-called skeptics aren’t interested in doing scientific work where they have to present evidence that is new or different from the current understanding. That’s especially surprising because the physical theory of greenhouse warming can be written down on paper, and the radiative transfer calculations needed to back them up are computationally cheap.

(By the way, all of these things exist for CO2-induced global warming.)

Damnthatsinteresting,feherz7,t1_feg5lga,1579115047.0,"There was never such a consensus. There were a few papers suggesting it.

People are often unaware that global warming has been studied since the 1800s. The original proposal that carbon dioxide emissions would warm the planet dates to the 19th century work of Svante Arrhenius. The modern understanding of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect in a stratified atmosphere dates to the 1930s. (As a climate scientist, the latter work is more important. The earlier debate between Arrhenius and Angstrom was based on flawed physics.)

By the 1960s, global-scale climate models showed how the CO2 greenhouse effect interacted with water vapor to amplify global warming. That’s when we started to realize there was a serious problem. Finally, the first real consensus on global warming emerged with the 1979 Charney Report. 

People seldom realize that the global warming consensus took about a century to emerge, and there was opposition all along the way. Many climate scientists have been skeptical. The last gasp of genuine skepticism by climate scientists was a 2001 proposal by Richard Lindzen that clouds could stop climate change, but even he acknowledged that there had to be *some* CO2 warming, and satellite observations of clouds quickly put his theory that to rest. Now we just debate how strong global warming will be, and the evidence on that point is even scarier than it was 10 years ago."

However, the US Census itself has a particular goal - determining total population for various government purposes - and is outlined in the Constitution. The Census must provide the most accurate count possible, along with a minimal set of demographic data. Adding an extraneous question on citizenship may impede that accurate count, as it may discourage people from answering, either from fear or from the simple perception that the census requirement doesn't apply to non-citizens."

A demand curve is typically inelastic because a relatively fixed number of goods are demanded by people with little option to leave the market. For example, if a certain number of people have job offers in an area or have family they must stay close to, then the demand for housing there will be highly inelastic. If their jobs or family don’t move, they will be highly resistant to moving away.
