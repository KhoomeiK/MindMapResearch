politics,ffbyd4v,t1_ffbwx26,1579786686.0,"Ah yes, the old “Democrats are the party of the KKK” canard. Not sure which century you’re in but that flipped more than 50 years ago when the Democrats passed the Civil Rights Act. Lyndon Johnson famously said that the Democrats have lost the south for a generation after he signed it. And he was right, the Republicans have had racist white voters on lock ever since. That’s why the Republican president said that “there are fine people on both sides” when a Nazi murdered a woman at their racist “Unite the Right” rally. 

But what this case is about is religious privilege, not religious freedom. It’s about the breaking down of the first amendment by the conservative court. It’s about taking tax money from our secular government and using it to fund religion. State funded religion. Be careful what you wish for, because when demographics flip and you’ve destroyed the wall between religion and government under the guise of “religious freedom”, you’re going to be unhappy being under the thumb of someone else’s superstitions. In this country you have religious freedom. You can worship or not worship in any way you see fit. You also have the right to free K-12 education. A secular education. If you want your kids to have a religious education then take them to church. If your “truth” is so weak that you’re afraid it will break down if it isn’t constantly reinforced every minute of every day, then you have the right to pay to send your child to a religious school, a madrasa or whatever. Go for it. But your religion doesn’t belong in our public schools and our tax dollars shouldn’t be spent on your madrasas or wherever you want your kids to go for religious learning. We already subsidize your church, maybe that should go away instead of y’all grabbing even more welfare."
