AskAnAmerican,ffii0qw,t3_etrk7x,1579974343.0,"Absolutely! I can't imagine having one and not parking in it, living anywhere with snow or rain or very strong sun. The elements can damage the car and add time to a getting-ready-to-leave routine. Extra junk can be culled or stored in the attic or a shed if it's absolutely necessary. The only thing I can see using a garage for if not car parking is a gym."

I lived in a trailer and never knew anyone who actually had one but they were in the soap operas and movies and I still want one today and think about how I could pull it off in my foyer or office where a glass block partition belongs, for all eternity."

I’d much rather hang out with Jasmine than Blake but that’s not because Blake’s lifestyle is at all bad or because Jasmine seems fun. He seems to have a very safe and bland life for a “music producer”; he just likes to go out with friends. Jasmine and I prefer staying in, doing workouts,  and having fewer people around. I relate better to her even though she’s boring."

HomeImprovement,fey5jm4,t3_elwckt,1579441076.0,I have the same godawful texture throughout my house. We got some water damage from the room in two upstairs rooms and will be replacing the ceiling in those soon after the steel roof goes on at the end of the month. Now I know what is possible for the downstairs if I get inspired.

The best thing we can do as consumers is don’t place bad orders, e.g. if you place an order, pick it up. The best thing we can do as employees is make the orders right on the first try. The best thing we can do as managers is have employee-take-home policies to prevent waste. The best thing we can do as people is support well-structured initiatives to help homeless."

SuddenlyGay,feii202,t1_feihf0j,1579139016.0,"There was a YouTube recording of someone arguing with their cell provider about a quoted rate outside the country of something like  .025 when it was supposed to be 0.25 and he refused to pay because no matter how far up the chain he got, they just kept quoting the rate wrong. Maybe someone can find that and share here. It’s a really good reminder that decimals matter."
