Battlefield,fdfsd8p,t1_fdfqlvd,1578369011.0,"I think giving the revive a timer (ex, takes about a half a second to revive someone in BFV) vs a cooldown (the syringe has a two second cooldown after being used twice in BF1) becomes more practical in a firefight. Yes, you could perform revives at a greater distance, but only a couple of times. In the BFV system you go close enough to someone and attract to them. 

The only drawback I can think of is that the downed person can't move, so if they die to a sniper or machine gunner you get put directly in their line of fire. I've killed plenty of people that way"
