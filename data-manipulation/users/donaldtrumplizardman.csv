fatlogic,fffs77s,t1_fffrgno,1579890649.0,"I think the first thing to do is accept that you will need to make a change that will last a lifetime. That way you can start making small changes that will last longer than trying to restrict yourself right away. Calculate the amount of calories you eat in a day, then trying eating 500-1000 calories less than that for the next week or two. Decrease until you get to the point you want to be at. If you suddenly start depriving yourself, of course you’re going to be hungry. As well, you risk going in the opposite direction and instead of your eating being disordered because you’re bingeing, it’ll be disordered cause you don’t eat enough. 

As for knowing when to stop, you really have to have willpower. I know that seems obvious, but sometimes you really just have to put yourself through something you don’t like until you don’t feel that way yet. Also, I would recommend maybe seeing a therapist because eating until you literally hurt or feel sick is often a form of self harm (coming from someone who goes to therapy and is recovering from a binge eating disorder)"

fatlogic,ff6ee0p,t1_ff4depi,1579625380.0,"Personally, I always had huge, unrealistic, hard-to-sustain goals.

I know to get where I want it’s going to take years, not months. 

The way I figure it is if I lose a pound a week, after a year I’ll have lost 52 lbs. idk if I need to actually lose that much, but my point is that with weight and obesity it’s about the long game. Not how much you can lose in a month or two. Small, simple changes over a long period of time are more realistic than expecting yourself to go from 3000 calories/day to 1200/day. Also, just get rid of soda. If you drink 24 oz/day in one month you’ve consumed FIVE POUNDS of refined sugar. Plus after a couple months without it, it’ll be fucking NASTY when you actually drink it. 

TL;DR: small, simple changes over a long period of time is more realistic and will build healthier habits. Also get rid of soda. Easiest way to cut out hella sugar."

fatlogic,ff6aupd,t1_ff69u2l,1579623148.0,"Hi! I am someone who takes seroquel and has for about 6 years for bipolar disorder. It absolutely increases your appetite after you take it. You aren’t even hungry, your appetite just increases. However, when i first took it, it was so strong that I feel like I always just passed tf out after like 15-30 minutes. I also took vyvanse in the morning so I hadn’t eaten all day. Therefore eating at night with the seroquel didn’t make me gain weight since I hadn’t eaten all day. 
I myself used the “it’s my medicine” excuse to binge a little at night, but it’s definitely controllable and I’ve been doing better to not eat just because the medication wants me to. It might be stronger at first but a good way to get around it might be to make some more healthy snacks before you take it, that way when you get a craving you’re eating carrots rather than pop tarts. 
Seroquel legitimately saved my life and I will sing it’s praises forever. You just gotta be careful and be honest with yourself. Also, if you’re feeling better you might not overeat due to emotional eating.
