photoclass2020,fgnh08h,t1_fgnclx1,1580944690.0,"There are a few variables here

1. Is your camera ISO invariant? This means that shooting at ISO 400 is the same as shooting at ISO 200 and increasing the exposure 1 stop in lightroom. In this case, just shoot at the aperture and shutter you want and leave your camera at base ISO.

2. Is your picture losing values you cant recover? Let's say you're shooting a sunset. If you blow out the highlights, sometimes you cant get that data back, no matter what. Likewise, if you under expose, your darks have such a low SNR the data is lost in noise.

In short, use the light meter as a good guideline, but dont hassle over small changes as long as your not losing data.

This is also a good reason to use auto modes. In your example, you really only care about aperture, so just use Aperture priority and dont worry about chasing the exposure meter."

Yall ever wonder what would happen if there was gravel, or an animal around the corner? The correct speed isnt determined by the curve, its determined by the weakest link in the chain of riding.

to react to an obstruction. Considering it takes 0.2 seconds to mentally react, you now have 0.23 seconds to identify the correct course of action, and physically move your bike to do it. (Youd be dead)

And if he had to stop, which takes about 200 ft at 60mph with a highly skilled rider, he would have had to omnisciently know about the obstruction 160 feet before seeing it. (Dead again)
