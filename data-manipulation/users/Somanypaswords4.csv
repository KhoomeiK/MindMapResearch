My history teacher basically lead me wrong in this one. If we have a military then people don't need the right to guns..., that makes no sense considering the entire text...

20+ years I was uncomfortable with that conclusion, but moving to a rural area with other militia groups opened up my eyes to the idea that what if the military is not going to follow the constitution, then the revolution is repeated to avoid tyranny... makes more sense."

It is already in 2A, so why leave it to the idiots to change the rules at state levels? Concealed carry should be universal for example. 

But 10A is a gray area? 

Would like informative discussion. My position is, and please show reference to the contrary, is Bernie doesn't believe buybacks are constitutional, so he is not going to take any guns more than the existing patchwork of unconstitutional laws, along with background checks and red flag laws. 

A note on those last two; they are not going away. They already exist in some way or another, and as long as a few people are actually benefiting from the war on guns with legitimate arrests or threats, that's all it takes. 

Ofcourse that means universal regulation, too.
