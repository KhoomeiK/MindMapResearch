Then there's the Eastern European mentality of being incredibly selfish. Rarely are the family parking spots occupied by actual families. Or you wait for a parking spot and someone steals it. Brake checking. Every weekend it's something.  Here the mentality is you do whatever you want, and if you get away with it then it's because others are naive. It's a level of selfishness that is hard to imagine for most Americans. I'm not saying the USA is paradise but I will say it's less annoying driving in the USA in terms of aggression.
