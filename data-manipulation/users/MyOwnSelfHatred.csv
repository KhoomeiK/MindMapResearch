cats,ff21wld,t1_ff21smr,1579491576.0,Oh yeah. It was a VERY BIG decision to make this purchase. I made 4 payments over 4 months. I save a lot of money on litter though so it is slowly paying for itself.

cats,ff21nea,t1_ff21hc7,1579491385.0,"I watched or read like 50 reviews before I got it. Lol. 

For pain, I've read and heard amazing things about an assisi loop. Never used it, but worth mentioning. :)"
cats,ff21aii,t3_er79d3,1579491118.0,"I have the LitterRobot and despite it's steep price, it is the best thing I've ever bought for my girls. It only took about 12 hours for me to be completely sold on my purchase. 

It could very likely be an issue for cats with mobility issues though. I bought the step entry for it, but it still has a pretty aggressive ledge to go over. May be worth a little look though. It takes basic clumping litter and I change out the line every 1.5 weeks with two cats. 

They do sell refurbished ones on their website on rare occasions that a person returns it. 

All I know is that not only do I love the convenience, but the girls love having a clean box basically every time they go in it."

childfree,fez0htw,t1_feyz2ti,1579452747.0,"THAT'S WHAT I SAID! Keep a blanket in the diaper bag. Also, the bathroom floor is probably cleaned/disinfected more often than the changing table."
childfree,feyfkcu,t1_fexn65k,1579444832.0,"Ugh. That's horrible! I've been to places that will get on your case about setting your beer down on the ledge of the pool table. 

Anyone that openly exposes others to possible bacteria or disease is OUT. That is so unsanitary!"
childfree,feyf4we,t1_fex5ehp,1579444664.0,"Absolutely! People hate me for having that thought process. How about I get a 50% discount off of goods and services if I have to tolerate a child disrupting my fun? 

There are a lot of places I have never gone back to because I just don't want to put up with children. There are plenty of places that are CENTERED around kids (ex - ChuckECheese). Go there!"
childfree,feyeolm,t1_fewne8x,1579444463.0,I don't plan to go back. I was the only woman in the group that despises children so I had to bite my tongue. There are much better places to be.
childfree,feyeee6,t1_fewa9rh,1579444349.0,I have also never thought of that and will not be using it anymore. Ugh!
cats,femtu9w,t3_epxhjg,1579269427.0,He's really enjoying his purrrm.
DecidingToBeBetter,fdyy31k,t3_en33ml,1578784714.0,"I'm 28, never married, no kids and finally going to school full-time for my degree starting Monday. I have felt very behind the curve for years. Never happy. I went military straight out of HS which delayed the rest of my plans. 

I will advise that you should continue to live in an easier financial situation until you figure out what you'd like your next step to be. Also, the military is NOT a fallback. You don't get to just not do it anymore so that is a decision you need to be absolutely certain about before you do it. 

Best of luck and you got this! Sacrifices are hard and sometimes they need to be made for progress."
childfree,fdywvkx,t3_enbzby,1578784342.0,I envy your tact. I would have said some choice things to her. Watching my mouth is not my greatest strength.
AskReddit,fdyvmg6,t3_en7n9i,1578784026.0,Jonah Hill. Absolutely worthless.
lyftdrivers,fdyq02s,t3_en9qzt,1578782418.0,"EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Not even lying, every time I have committed to a scheduled pick-up, I will head that way near time and they will send the ""Oops, something went wrong"" to me. Fuck no, it didn't. Guaranteed you offered it to someone else! Crap like that is why I spend most of my time working for Uber instead."
dating_advice,fc1xug7,t3_efplkj,1577333088.0,"Ah darling, you are doing the right thing by focusing on you and your success first. I (28F) am returning to college full time for the first time in close to 10 years because it clicked that I need to figure out my life and the things that I want before I can be happy enough and settled enough with myself to think of anything else. Believe me, I thought I would be married and possibly with kids by now and every guy I date I do so with the intent of that happening, but buckle down, enjoy your early 20s and make that personal success happen. You got this and you got you. As an outsider looking in, I am crazy proud of what you have done so far! Once you've attained this goal, you'll figure out the next step."
