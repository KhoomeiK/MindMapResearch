The US has far more of these than the UK does. They apparently have 14 submarines with 25 SLBMs each. Far more than sufficient to destroy every major settlement on the planet (and, of course, the Russians would presumably be ""helping out"").

Maybe let's not have a nuclear war, eh what?"
todayilearned,fe80v8w,t1_fe7vdu0,1578921114.0,"The UK nuclear deterrent is [Vanguard class submarines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard-class_submarine).

According to the Wikipedia page, one of those carries up to 16 [missiles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGM-133_Trident_II), but each missile flies up into space and then breaks apart into 8 independently targetable nukes. You can simulate one of those nukes on the nukemap by selecting the ""trident D5"" preset.

One submarine can therefore launch 128 of those. And the UK has four of these submarines (of which at least two are out on patrol at any time).

... And the US has far more weapons than that..."

ZeroWaste,fd7djso,t1_fd6s46p,1578202800.0,"There are two separate issues: energy consumption, and where the material ends up.

The cardboard isn't going to end up clogging the oceans or something. Although the plastic may need less energy to produce, it's just a more problematic material to have around in the first place.

Crucially, you can generate energy ""nicely"" with renewables or such. There is no way for infrastructure development to make the non-recyclable single use plastic OK."
