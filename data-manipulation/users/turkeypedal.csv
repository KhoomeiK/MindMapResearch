QContent,ffcqbhh,t1_ffcl3sw,1579804992.0,"Helping someone do something unethical is itself unethical. So what you are saying is that Roko has an ethical obligation to do something unethical. That's a contradiction. 

That's a bit abstract, so maybe a more realistic example would help. Ryan has promised Matt she would help him get money for his operation. Rob also knows Yancy, a former bank thief who is itching for a reason to try again. Rob, of course, believe robbing banks is wrong. Rob would not be ethically obligated to tell Matt about Yancy and let him decide if he wants Yancy to rob a bank for him.

Just change the names and you have the same thing here. Roko is not ethically obligated to tell May about Yay and let her decide if she wants to let them do unethical things to get money. 

Heck, I'll be more specific. Yay almost certainly stole their money. They have no ethics beyond ""don't modify an AI's mind."" They have the computational resources to crack any level of encryption. And there's tons of money out there that is only protected by the encryption a computer uses.

television,ffborzp,t1_ffblnvn,1579776169.0,"I typed ""whoopi goldberg bernie sanders"" into Google. I found no recent Whoopi Goldberg comments about him.

The closest I did find were other people on the View saying they believed Warren over Sanders on whether the latter told her that a woman could not win the presidency. Goldberg just said she was over Sanders now. 

But even if she did agree with Warren, believing one person in a he-said/she-said situation does not mean someone is spreading lies and disinformation. They find Warren more persuasive on the issue than Sanders. 

Personally, I assume he said something similar, but not quite the same, and this is how Warren took it. I don't care either way, because I know Sanders isn't a misogynist, so, even if he did say it, he just would have meant that he thought that there were enough misogynists in America that it would make it difficult for a woman to be elected. 

If you don't think misogyny played at least some role in people electing Trump over Clinton, I have a bridge to sell ya. The percentage may have been small, but Clinton also lost by a very small percentage. Plus I heard tons of misogynist things about Clinton then. 

I have no doubt that, if Warren gets the nomination, the same shit will come out again. She will be ""shrill"" despite her low speaking voice. There will be pins saying ""don't be a pussy."" She'll be called a lesbian, a man hater. People will comment about how unattractive she is, about how she doesn't smile enough, call her a bitch, say she's emasculating, and so on--stuff they don't do to male politicians. (Yes, people comment about Trump being out of shape or old, but no one judges him by whether they want to fuck him.)

I would never say it's impossible. But I do think that any woman who runs for president will have to get even more supporters to make up for the misogynists who would vote against her. 

On the other hand, she would likely get a boost from other people for  running to be the first female president. And maybe that boost would be enough--though it clearly wasn't for Clinton."

QContent,ffbkqyy,t1_ffb72fo,1579770026.0,"What do you have in mind that Roko could do? About the only ethical thing that seems like it would be useful in this situation would be money, and Yay's lack of morality and the amount of money Yay had in such a short time suggests they did something unethical to get it. They don't currently have it, so they'd have to do something unethical to get it back. 

Plus, well, Roko isn't the one with the power. Yay is. Yay would be driving. Anything Roko told Yay to do, Yay could wind up doing something unethical to achieve it. That's the whole problem with amoral AI--they may do what you ask, but in a way you would not approve of. This is a problem AI researchers in the real world deal with. 

I do have one idea: maybe just use Yay's vast computational resources to come up with ideas. Sure, a lot of them might not be moral, but maybe they'd stumble upon a good one. As long as Roko is the one actually implementing the ideas, she could make sure it was done in an ethical way.

The problem women had with blunt guys wasn't that they were blunt, but that all they wanted was sex, when they wanted more. So guys started pretending to want more as well, when all they were really after was sex. So it started to become refreshing when a guy would just admit he was after sex rather than pretend to care. At least the women who were not into casual sex could shut them down. 

Another issue with ""nice guys"" is that they went too far. They would just be extra nice and never say what they wanted. Some people have this idea that being nice means always being indirect. There is a balance, where you are nice, but you also make your intentions known. 

Finally, there are people who think being nice means being a doormat. Confidence and assertiveness are attractive qualities. Acting like you're too scared to ask someone out isn't. And that is what a lot of nice guys do--they never actually ask her out, and wonder why she considers them as just friends.

videos,fejchl0,t1_feiwpww,1579167134.0,"The main issue there is that it mistakes symptoms for cause. Not fitting stereotypes doesn't mean someone is trans, but it can be what clued a trans person into that fact.

It's as if these cis women are taking the trans man's statement about himself and taking that as some sort of indictment of them. That they are really men. And the irony is that they then get upset about this because that idea makes them feel very bad. They just got the smallest of taste of what gender dysphoria feels like. 

And that's the answer. The trans person doesn't just not fit gender stereotypes. They feel a gender dysphoria, and these gender stereotypes make it worse. 

No middle ground is needed. Just stop assuming the stereotypes are what makes a trans person trans. Stop assuming stereotypes define gender. And stop asking trans people how they figured out they were trans and then assuming that is what made them trans.

It's not as if people can just go transition on their own. They go to a specialist who deals with these sorts of things. These specialists have ways of telling the difference between different stuff. And they know how to try out different things to see if they help. 

Before medical transitioning is even offered, there will be a small trial of dressing differently and seeing if that helps. There will be trying out the transition, dressing like the other gender. There will then be a 1-2 year period where the person has to spend most of their time living as trans.

And, even then, they aren't going to turn it on max right away. They'll see if blocking a little testosterone seems to help a trans woman, or if adding it helps the trans man. 

It's a long and tested procedure from the medical community. They make sure it's not just a phase or that something else is wrong.

videos,fej9j7x,t1_feiom4g,1579162835.0,"There are two responses I can give, both of which are correct:

How do you know you're a man? You've never experienced what being a woman feels like, so how would you know that you're not a woman? 

The answer is pretty simple: you don't feel any discomfort when you think of yourself s a man. If someone calls you ""he"" or otherwise assumes you are a man, it feels right--so right you don't even really notice. 

Such is not the case for a trans person. When a trans woman thinks of herself as a man, she feels discomfort. When people refer to her as male, she feels discomfort. It feels wrong, and she does notice. 

Of course, that discomfort could be something else. That's why there is a trial period. She tries out looking like a woman, getting people to refer to her as a woman, and thinking of herself as a woman. Does that ease the discomfort? The traditional period is 2 years before you even consider hormones, let alone anything more permanent. 

They try it, and it works. It alleviates their gender dysphoria. And, well, since the whole concept is in the mind anyways, if you feel better, you are better. If a trans woman feels that being a woman feels as obviously true as you feeling like you're a man, then that's what they are--a woman. 

You're right--feeling like a man just feels normal to you. That's because you are a man. It doesn't feel like anything. If it feels wrong, but then, when you try being a woman, that feels right, then then you are a woman.

Edit: Unfortunately, the question I replied to was asked in bad faith. The reply below will show that the poster does not think trans people are real--that gender is just what your genitals are, and that trnas people have some deep seated ""real problem"" other than, you know, having been in the wrong body.

You didn't think ""oh, I'm cis"" when someone referred to you as the gender you were assigned at birth and it didn't bother you. 

It's just that, when you heard those terms, you knew what you were. Straight described you, but gay, bi, ace, etc. didn't. Trans didn't describe you, so you must be cisgender. You likely don't remember a specific time that happened.

Sure, maybe they'll take clips from a video or something, but that's not going to be representative of a community. And, most of the time, context is lost in the clip anyways.

videos,fej63jw,t1_feitths,1579158408.0,"If you are curious about something, that inherently means you don't have enough information to decide what is true or not. To be opinionated means that you've already made up your mind. These two ideas are in conflict. 

This is not to say that you can't have a tentative opinion. You may have a small amount of information, and have some idea of what your opinion is, but want more information. However, those who tentatively disagree won't argue vociferously that you are wrong, because they don't know if you're wrong. 

It's not about submissiveness. It's about determining if the person you are responding to is on the up-and-up. Did they accurately represent themselves? If so, great. Even if you say flat out you disagree, then that's a debate we can have from that position. 

The problem arises when someone claims to be curious, but actually is completely opposed to everything you say. Unlike the sincerely curious person who will ask more questions, still trying to work out all the information, the opposition will instead use whatever they can to try and discredit you. Most often they use rhetorical tricks that, while you can argue against, create the aesthetic that they are right and make it difficult. 

Furthermore, arguing with people who have made up their minds without the facts is often a waste of time. Unless you can quickly get them to realize that they didn't actually logically come to their conclusion, you're sunk. Said people can be convinced, but it won't happen in some online argument with a stranger. It takes concentrated effort. You can't logically argue someone out of an opinion they didn't logically come to in the first place. 

And trying to do so is a waste of time. Time is finite, and my time is better spend arguing with people with whom there is some chance of changing their mind than an opinionated person who makes it clear in their first few replies that they are not actually interested in changing their mind. 

In an ideal world, I could keep on arguing with them forever, hoping that something I'd say would break through. But, in this world, I will just give them the information, give them a chance, and then end the conversation to go talk to someone who is actually genuinely curious.
