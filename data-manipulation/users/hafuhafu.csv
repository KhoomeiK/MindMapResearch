Does the US do literally anything to combat the insane incarceration rate and piss-poor recidivism rate of its inmates? Hell no.

Our prisons, the prisons in the United States of America, are absolute shitholes comparable to war-torn third world countries.

You want to argue that ""Jamal"" is always going to commit crimes and is always going to go to prison? Well in the US of A, yeah, that's going to happen, because we offer literally nothing to rehabilitate or prevent criminal conduct.

The United States of America literally profits off of incarcerations because the state literally pays for them, using our tax dollars, to operate. The more people they incarcerate, the more money they get. All that money, yours and my tax dollars, get pocketed by the owners and bureaucrats while they literally invest the lowest possible denomination into containing criminals.

""Jamal"" committing crimes and re-offending is literally by design, and your hard earned American dollars is being used to line the pockets of people who are trying to guarantee that the status-quo maintains.

What are you talking about? There are identifiable cause and effects in play to why a certain group of people behave or function, and we can easily identify who the oppressors are in a relationship of cultures.

We literally have the data right now of what the underlying issues are, and conservatives tend to dismiss the notion that racism, poverty, and a lack of education are the primary contributors of these issues.

If anyone is washing their hands of the problem, it's those people dismissing data in favor of asserting the racist notion that ""That's just the way those people are."""

>How about we start to take a look at the cultures that produce so much violence rather than make excuses for it?

A culture is a product of it's environment. Like blacks in America, Aboriginals had to co-exist with European/American settlements. So we can probably make the assessment that their culture was influenced either 'not at all' or 'negatively', because of racist/elitist sentiments by the latter.

Europeans had a tendency to have a less than stellar human rights record when colonizing new regions.

From my understanding of Australia compared to the US, the cost of living is higher down there, and the resources to support and educate the under-privilege and impoverish is far less invested in.

Again, I think it comes down to a cost-analysis. Is it cheaper to incarcerate or uplift the underclass citizens of your country? If it's the former, then what's the real objection to them being arrested? Seeing as it's the latter though ([more government support](https://www.education.gov.au/what-government-doing-support-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-students)), I think that Australia is becoming privy to the notional that they attributed to the epidemic of crime and incarceration of Aboriginals."

The game has an average playtime among owners of between 6-12 hours **total**. You are a part of the minority. If playtime doesn't matter, then don't bring it up, but since you did don't deny the fact you represent the incredible minority distribution of the player base.

>Maybe you should subscribe to the PZ subreddit  
>  
>If you feel the game needs to go in a different direction maybe you shouldn't be sharing this with a stranger but on the actual PZ forum itself if you're trying to leave constructive feedback?

I used to post/lurk on the actually Indiestone forums, but gave up when they continued to cater the game towards the most diehard survival fans, adding more minute features while leaving the larger aspects of the game unpolished.

Besides, all I did was espouse my summative counter-points to the OPs statement, but you wanted to have a deeper discussion on the game, so here we are. We're both in it.

>As for what you consider a 'worthwhile direction' couldn't be less clear.

Worthwhile direction is focusing on completing the game, not adding minutia while simultaneously upgrading LUA, models and animations. They have even stated that because they decided to make these changes halfway through development, they had to go back and rework everything else they already did. They essentially wasted several years of work because of it, and only prolonged their development cycle. That is not an effective or productive method of development.

>You seem to indicate that because I personally haven't had criticism for the game here that I will always vehemently defend it. That's incorrect.  
>  
>Also, your assertion that anyone who doesn't is somehow a drooling fan who loves the game and cannot be objective about its shortcomings is speculative at best.

I believe that sunk-cost fallacy is a real thing, and if your happy and content with the game as is, as someone with almost 1000 hours played, that's a terrible sign. Your experience in the game at those levels should afford you more relevant insight to the game's development and the staffs efforts. If you're just happy with the game as is, the developers see that as indicative to just keep doing what they're doing, which is mismanaging priorities and constant delaying benchmarks.

&#x200B;

And just to throw this out there because you seem so adamant that single player is the inferior game mode to multiplayer, last I checked, multiplayer is still a pain in the ass to coordinate. After 7 years of development, they still haven't given players the ease of access to play with one another, or improve stability. They're too busy trying to build the rest of the game."

I think you are being too dismissive of the other fans who feel like the game is not heading in a productive or worthwhile direction.
