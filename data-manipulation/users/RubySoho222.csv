LifeProTips,fff79io,t3_et2txr,1579877496.0,Thank you for this!!!!
SuicideBereavement,fff6098,t3_etao3y,1579876591.0,"I’m sorry for your pain. I have a thing with judging people who make grieving people their emotional dumping ground. I think they’re insensitive and self centered. Don’t they have other people with the emotional space to vent to? You’re not a bad person for feeling this way, especially so soon after your loss. My “best friend” thought 4 days after my brothers suicide would be a good time to dump all her marriage problems on me over a 2 hour conversation. It was draining. It’s been 5 months and she’s never asked how I’m doing but won’t hesitate to tell me her issues. We don’t talk much anymore. 

Please don’t focus on whether you’re a good or bad person right now, you’re trying to survive the unthinkable. There’s a page on Instagram and Facebook called “Refuge in Grief” and it’s helped me so much. She is the author of a book called “It’s okay not to be okay” Megan Devine."

SuicideBereavement,fff1i34,t3_et8gbr,1579873115.0,"I’m so sorry for your pain and dealing with people like that. I got the same messages and I just deleted those people from my life. I’m from a small town and everyone knows the details of my brothers suicide because of his wife. Now people blame my mom. At a time when privacy is so important for the grieving process, people’s intentions are cruel. I hope you can find some peace through this. If you need someone to talk to you can message me."
relationship_advice,ffevwz6,t1_ffegoy0,1579867781.0,"At least this thread gave me some comic relief. Working the streets is a symptom of an addiction. Addiction makes you do things you wouldn’t do in a sober state in order to obtain more of the substance you’re addicted too. Your body is so addicted you can’t stop without experiencing  physical withdrawals that can kill you. Ever heard of a medical detox from an addicting substance? Probably not because it would cost thousands of dollars to attend for a week in the states and I’m under the impression y’all don’t give too many shits about drug addicts, unless they or their parents have money. 

What kind of weed are you guys smoking down there? Does it take away your ability to speak or your motor skills? Is it similar to a K-hole? Where you think people can’t clean their house whilst being stoned? What do you say about people who use for medicinal purposes? Can you use cocaine, alcohol, heroine in the same manner? So many questions. 

OPs husbands seems like a dick with his reactions to her. 100%. His weed smoking is posing a problem within his relationship. Doesn’t make him an addict. Neither do unconstitutional laws such as mandatory drug testing. He’s just a dick and selfish. Yet we have one side of the relationship from her point of view. 

It’s interesting to me how many people marry and have children with people they know they aren’t compatible with. Like having a kid is going to magically change someone? Would she have married him if he likes to indulge in shooting up? Doubtful. Now she doesn’t know what to do about her choice to bring a kid into the world with him. Hard truths. 

I’m confused though by your country’s views on things. Like calling pot heads drug addicts but also having the legal ability to buy a 40oz of liquor and a gun on the same street corner. Priorities......"
relationship_advice,ffd4qpo,t1_ffd21u3,1579813389.0,"Maybe we have differing views. My sister is an actual drug addict. 

Can you become dependent on weed? Most certainly. But you’re not out working the streets for a joint. You’re not going through withdrawals that can stop your heart if you stop for the day. Irritability from jonesing for a joint hardly constitutes an addiction. It’s a dependency.

Ruined their lives by becoming sex workers? By stealing from family and friends? Or are they just lazy and unmotivated and the pot is a good excuse."
