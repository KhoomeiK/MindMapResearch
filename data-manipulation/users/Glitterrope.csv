Lupe has that relaxed vibe about his music and it is definitely more consistent. However, Lupe's trash album, Tetsuo and Youth, destroyed the fantastic albums before it and was easily the point we can look at when discussing when he fell off because to me, it was BAAAAD.

It looked fantastic (visually) and the guns were pretty good. For me it was the entire feel of the game as well as the bugs and the irksome mechanics that snubbed both Medic and Support classes. 

I jumped back to BF1 fairly quick after I gave BF V a full open-minded try. I'm certain it has changed since I last played it, but I'm not going back to it even when BF1 finally croaks"

No, I read your post and it's no different. It's the exact same thing in the show as in the book.

Personally, I'm tired of this pretentiousness around books. Books aren't above being tossed off my shelf. If I don't want a book, just like any other object, it's getting tossed. In the case of books, that means donation. To act like books are somehow above contributing to clutter is nonsense. They ARE just objects at the end of the day. I have a Bookshelf full and will be getting another in the near future. Until then, if I don't have space, a book I don't care about is getting tossed in favor of that one if I like it. 

If you're a book hoarder and you're happy being a book hoarder, then more power to you.

I did the reviews on my computer, but outside of the internet on like a word document that I just kept in my files offline. Then I swapped a bit to writing it

It not only got we writing, but it get me out of my comfort zone as well, engaging in entertainment that I most definitely wouldn't have engaged in before if only because it added a new entry to my reviews. I engage in all of it mindfully as well instead of just tuning it all out.

It brings me no joy to show everyone what I do. My handwriting is atrocious so I keep it to myself. The enjoyment is purely mine and at the end of the day, that's what matters. Enjoyment is what makes it worth it, regardless of if you're publishing it for the viewing pleasure of others.

books,femsu07,t1_fekxp2g,1579268616.0,"Imagine having a mentality of ""I can treat this material like trash because kids these days are willing to accept trash."" The BEST of pretty much anything made for the YA audience is also appreciated by adults for being good work. How to Train your Dragon, Pokemon, Harry Potter, Divergent, The Neverending Story, Avatar the Last Airbender, Teen Titans, a Series of Unfortunate Events, Ready Player One, The Lorax, The Grinch, Spongebob, Warrior Cats, Redwall, The Tales of Despereaux, I can go on and on. Just because the kid or YA audience is the target demographic doesn't meant that it should be trash.

To assume that children will dislike something that's not dumbed down is to literally insult the intelligence of your audience

And no, YA is NOT held to a lower standard. It's held to the same standard as adult books. There are just some things in adult books that one shouldn't be put in YA and kids (aka sex).

&#x200B;

> Taylor leaves aside the issue of why women appear to read so much more fiction than men do – and in a sense, fair enough. She can’t cover everything, and her book isn’t called “Why Women Read Fiction and Men Don’t.” But I was disturbed by what felt to me like an acceptance of a “feminised” culture of reading.

Wouldn't it makes more sense to do this though? It seems like it would make more sense and one could get a more accurate reason instead of basically speculating the reason why and hooking it back to ""Patriarchy is why women read.""

If you're looking for the reason why women read fiction, it would pay to look at how the sexes differ in their reasons for reading fiction to ensure that it's not a reason as simple as ""I just like reading.""

books,fek4857,t3_epjpdd,1579192263.0,"Good luck passing this kind of law and good luck even more enforcing it. Besides the obvious erotica, what makes a book ""age appropriate?"" I remember reading the book ""Asking For It"" about a girl who was raped and it was about her coping along with seeking justice and her life in the aftermath with the media sensationalizing the whole thing. It's an obvious commentary on society's views and Media's approach towards rape. Given that it's also made recently (Sep 2015), it definitely had me too in mind

The book has definite realities to it and to keep these teens from being able to discuss horrid realities that actually happen to some of them is not only doing them a MASSIVE disservice but, in the case of stuff like rape, it undermines the point of #metoo.

One of my favorite books of all time is the Tales of Despereaux. In that book besides a cute mouse holding a needle as a sword......... lies a terrible death of a character and the physical/emotional/verbal abuse of one of the girls in the book, who got smacked to the point where she was partially deaf. Memory is hazy, but I think she also had a meltdown at some point in the book. Was the book age appropriate? The writing style certainly was because me at that age could understand. I love that book

What makes a theme age-appropriate? Should both of those books be considered ""adult"" because abuse and rape are both ""adult"" things to discuss? What about suicide and substance abuse? Should suicide and substance abuse put the book in adult territory because they're both ""adult"" things to talk about? How are we to grow and learn about the world? How are we supposed to reach the conclusion that, as painful as it can be, it's still worth living?
