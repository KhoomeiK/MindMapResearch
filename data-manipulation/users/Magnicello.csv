Plus I don't think anybody is saying it's a meritocratic system, because a pure meritocracy is a bad thing. It'd leave those who can't work for themselves behind. Companies today have pension funds for retirees."
BoJackHorseman,fg1mlm5,t1_fg1ktls,1580429828.0," You're downplaying the actual reasons why startups fail. Just google ""Why startups fail"" and you'll get the myriad of reasons why they go out of business within 5 years. There's also so many startups that have made it. If they're offered a buyout then that's a success story. Musk himself started with Zip2, sold it, built PayPal then sold that again. Now he's found himself a niche he's a.) passionate about and b.) he could compete in. 


It's really easy to make generalizations about things we only see from our perspective. It takes much more to see that the world is really a much more complex place than we make it to be."

Have you ever been a CEO of any company? Or even just a team leader in any competitive area in general? Because I don't think you realize how much it takes to go from a single company to be a conglomerate. How many right decisions you have to make to get to that level of success. It all comes back to the idea that you're downplaying the abilities of people who made the most out of their situations, both rich and poor."

BoJackHorseman,ffzmhsj,t1_ffzjuc0,1580385964.0,Do you have a source that those stories are untruthful? Because it's incredibly offensive to discredit the hard work and the sheer shit people crawled had to crawl through to get out of poverty.
BoJackHorseman,ffzmfcb,t1_ffzja78,1580385888.0,"The problem is that people blame capitalism for that as a whole when it's actually just unbridled capitalism, same way communism is supposed to be this perfect system when the times it was applied it failed miserably, same way thinking Black people=criminals, when in actuality it's an extremely complex issue. It's all faulty generalizations."

BoJackHorseman,ffzisj2,t1_ffzasq7,1580381260.0,This feels Kafkaesque as hell. The Trial much? What do YOU think it's about?
BoJackHorseman,ffzipan,t1_ffzgxvv,1580381134.0,I wholeheartedly agree. There are some seriously fucked up practices that some companies do. That's why capitalism needs to be tempered with socialistic principles like a social safety net and worker unions. It's a stretch but ideally everyone would have a stake in some investment instrument as well.
BoJackHorseman,ffza00a,t1_ffz9nud,1580369012.0,"No I do. It's a simplistic ""capitalism is evil"" story. My problem is that the public made this happen. Let's use the vertical integration part of the video as an example: Why didn't the public bring their business to Whitewhale's competitors? It's because Whitewhale was bringing the cheapest gas to the market.


It's the public that turned Whitewhale into the giant that it is today. A business just gives the public what it wants. Demonizing them when you made them in the first place is childish and hilarious. 


Also did you know BoJack was produced and distributed by companies? Fuck capitalism for actualizing BoJack Horseman, right?"
BoJackHorseman,ffz9g9b,t1_ffz8mh6,1580368331.0,"Is it really fucked up to save up money, sacrifice having a comfortable lifestyle, take the risk of starting a business (which could lead to being bankrupt) and if you succeeded, which is very unlikely in the first place, reap the rewards?


I think you may be seeing it from a narrow point of view. The system that's supposedly so fucked up allowed the very demonization of that system to take place, from their own pocket nonetheless, after all."
BoJackHorseman,ffz7ibq,t1_ffz3tge,1580366395.0,"Did his father also inherit it from his own father though? I mean it's gotta start somewhere. Someone along the line sacrificed their lifestyle and actually got the whole thing rolling.

Survivorship bias makes it easy to see those who succeeded and resent them, while ignoring those whose businesses actually failed, which is like more than half of all startups by their 5th year."

Although, actual people hustling out there don't really care for the ""global poor"" because they themselves are already having a hard time. If you're criticizing people who join the military to get out of poverty, you should also criticize people who do commit crimes to get ahead. The moral argument is a double- edged sword."

Actually Liberia is a country in Africa founded in the belief that freed Black people would fare better and be more prosperous there. It's an absolute shithole now because of multiple civil wars but the idea of a country for freed Black people existed. 

I understand the wealth divide. It obviously exists in the Philippines too. My point is there are those who face the same issues as everyone but manage to get themselves out of it. 


I understand systemic racism exists in the US but are white supremacy beliefs held by most Americans? Don't people get along normally? The mean world syndrome is a legit thing."

Does this really matter? I'm from a country where my ancestors have been colonized twice, by the Spanish and the Americans, and occupied by the Japanese.
