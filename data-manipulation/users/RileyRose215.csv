Then learn the best shades, colors,tricks, etc, to enhance your features.  There are tons of good makeup tutorials on Youtube that discuss literally every aspect of makeup ...how to apply correctly, explore different looks for different occasions, etc.  The same could be applied to clothing.  Most women have positive and negative things that clothes can either accentuate of exaggerate.  Find clothes that are flattering and fun to wear:)  Also, don't neglect things like your eye brows and nails."
transgender_support,ffd4rq0,t3_esk3hc,1579813405.0,"As far as your hair, you can go for something on the androgynous side and style it in more of a feminine way when you can.  Sorry, I don't know what the laws regarding hrt are in the UK.  When I started hrt, I had to wait until I was 16 and needed a parent's consent.  If you are able to find hrt without your parents, possibly illegally, you may risk your health, and at some point they will know that something is up anyway. So not sure you want to go that route.  Take heart in knowing that most of us feared the same as you do.  The fear of getting masculine characteristics can cause a lot of stress in our lives, but look to some of the beautiful women who transitioned later in life as inspiration.  There are always things you can do, down the road to 'enhance' your outward femininity and you will never lose your feminine heart and soul.

Oh and by the way,  you should have counseling, if not required, before you start hrt."

ask_transgender,ffd1lju,t3_escnzn,1579811620.0,"I don't think you need to feel like you don't belong.  I know cis women that have masculine interests, aren't into 'girly' things, etc.  Even if there weren't, what's wrong with being unique?  I would think that being yourself would be the most comfortable thing.  By the way, I also know feminine guys that are interested in things like beauty, decorating, women's fashion, etc...both straight and gay.  I think this is a point in time when both men and women are more just being themselves, not letting society tell us what we should look like, what things we should like, etc.  I think all this leaves you being part of the human race and that's group you belong to.  So, enjoy doing the things that you like, hang out with who you like, wear what you want and be happy."

ask_transgender,ffd09kt,t3_esws2k,1579810880.0,"As far as things like hair and eye color, skin type, etc. I took more after my mother.  Both sides of my family seem to be on the smaller side, not many tall people, male of female, in my family and they mostly seem to be on the ""thin"" side and shortish.  I think that did improve my transition. However, I also seemed to inherit a rather angular facial structure and somewhat large forehead from my father's side so I don't think those features improved my transition.  I guess what I'm saying is that I resemble both in some ways and yes, it affected my transition, some good, some undesirable."

It sounds like she would be open to that.  On the other hand, there is a chance that she will be reserved about telling you.  I know that in my cause, I find it difficult to actually say, feeling like no matter what I say, it might come off as 'slutty' and I don't want to turn off someone that might otherwise be serious.   I think there are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to transwomen and sex.  In the end, it's good to discuss it such things as not every woman, cis or transgender, is the same."

We all have names that kind of ring a bell for us, that we like on other people, etc.  Example, for a lot of transomen have friends, or celebrities whose names sound elegant or cute, or glamorous.  There are so many choices. You'll might to pick something that says something about your personality or is related to something you love. Since you will live with it the rest of your life, take you time.  There's no hurry.  When you think of something that you like, let it sink in for a while.  Maybe take a break from thinking about it and just go back to it here and there to see if you still are comfortable with it."
ask_transgender,fej7hcj,t3_epccx7,1579160127.0,"Almost 13 yrs and couldn't imagine life any other way.  At that time, I was somewhat young to transition and my life before was a constant struggle to express myself as I needed to.  I had some very understanding and supportive family, but my father and I were never close.  After transitioning and with time, my relationship with my father has improved somewhat and I'm hopeful that will continue to grow.  Before coming out, I basically had to present as male in school and public in general.  That was the source of much anxiety and depression.  Afterward, I was so much happier, at peace and comfortable with my self.  I felt like me and there's no better way to feel.  I have a job that I love.  Friends that I love and my relationship with family, for the most part, is wonderful.  The only negative thing in my life, post transition is that I find romantic relationships hard to maintain.  However, being yourself is the most important thing...at least for me it is."

ask_transgender,fehpjio,t3_ep6fed,1579121303.0,"That's really something that comes up...in different forms...a lot. I usually answer cis people by asking them, how did they know what gender they are?  In my earliest memories,  (I am mtf) I thought I was a girl...just like the other girls... and had no idea of what I was in for in the coming years.  I couldn't understand at first, why people were saying.. no, you're a boy.  I then started to learn what is considered to be the real different between being born male and being born female.  Before I can remember, I obviously related to the females in my life and knew I was the same as them, actually knew it.   That is what is most difficult to put into words...I just knew it. This is the case with many, although from talking with others and researching this, I found that it's not always the case.  For some, there is a uncertainty, confusion, suppression of feeling,etc.

After writing all this, I reread it and felt like I didn't really write or explain it well at all.  I think I made the main point tho, hope it helps."
ask_transgender,fehn0yp,t3_ep3wt9,1579119851.0,"I think that some don't have less sex drive than before and others do.  While mine did decrease some,  it was also kind of 'reborn' in a different way...more emotional and intimacy driven than before.  It's not a bad thing in my case, it's just different.  I guess the bottom line is that it does for some..maybe most."
transgender_support,fehlirt,t3_ep5vyy,1579118980.0,"You will need a parents consent to start at 16.  As far as I know, doctors still will require a letter from you psychologist.  Have you talked about hrt with him/her?   Your insurance may or may not cover it, so look into that too.  Good luck!"

TransSpace,feepaxu,t3_eopuix,1579038377.0,"Unless you wait for a coincidence where it comes up and you get to see how your family reacts, you're going to have to find a way to broach the subject.   There are some very successful transwomen celebrities now, maybe you could just ask, say,  your mother what she thinks of one.  For instance,  Orange is the New Black,  where one of the actresses is a transwoman.  Does anyone in your family watch it?  Maybe you could just say, hey what do you think of that?  The same with Supergirl who has  Nicole Maines, another transwoman.  Something like that is the only thing I can think of beside taking a chance and just opening up to someone in your family. I hate to say it, since it obviously stresses you out, but in the end, that is what you might have to do.  You could also seek counseling through an lgbt center and discuss the best way to do that."
transgender_support,feemt74,t3_eofc8k,1579036937.0,"First, there's no rule that says you have to have grs.  Some people, for many reasons, live as the gender they identify as without surgery...especially bottom surgery.  Also, you don't have to identify as either gender.  Some just choose to identify and live as non binary or gender fluid, etc.  I think what qualifies you as male comes from inside anyway, not how other people see you, or how you appear on the outside.  Gender surgery or just living as transgender if more about a need for your outside to match your inside.  In the end, you decide how much you need that.  Anyone that is questioning thier birth gender to a strong degree would benefit from counseling with someone experienced in gender identity.  Good luck in your journey to understand yourself more."
transgender_support,feem0u4,t3_eoiqhs,1579036476.0,"I think it can be kind of an affirmation to others, so in that way yes. Also there seems to be many people that do struggle with the question of are they transgender or not, so I would think that exploring, learning and being diagnosed would be a relief.  It is good that you want to talk to someone about your feelings.  Is there an LGBT center near you that offers either counseling or referrals?  Sometimes they can offer or arrange such services according to you ability to pay or in some cases for free.  Do some research to see if there are services available in your area...and good luck!"
transgender_support,feekrj3,t3_eodo8y,1579035743.0,"Well when you mentioned that it was during a family emergency, so she was apparently under a lot of stress.  I know it's hard, but sometimes we just have to give those in our life, a break.  It sounds like she's trying and was just frustrated at the time.  When someone is emotionally exhausted,  sometimes they get to a point of just saying... I don't care.  It doesn't mean that they actually feel that way.  Remember, even when someone if very supportive, understanding, etc, they still will never be able to fully relate to being transgender and sometimes we need to have the patience that we expect from others."
transgender_support,feejjwu,t3_eoobvm,1579035042.0,"I think there are different reasons that someone might be confused about their gender identity.  I also don't know for sure if you HAVE to have dreams of being the opposite gender to be transgender.  Possibly some people are their birth assigned gender in dreams because they are suppressing their feelings.  I really can't say though.  I could only tell you what it was like for me.  I have discussed different aspects of being transgender with other transpeople and have sometimes been surprised at how their experiences differed from mine...so I don't think any one of us can tell you.   I think if you have questioned your identity and are confused, it's best to get counseling by someone with experience in the matter....someone qualified....to help you explore your feelings. Good luck!"

It's nice to see someone like that educating others who have less awareness of what transgender people feel and go through.  He gave rational explanations, he countered misconceptions and I think said many things that we would say when we're trying to talk to cis people.  I wish this kind of discussion would happen more...and parents could especially benefit from it."

I'm just saying that most transgender women aren't usually interested in doing that and in many if not most cases, are unable to do that.   I think that misconception comes from the many crossdressers who frequent transender related sites, forums, etc.  Also from porn videos.  You didn't answer my question about your spouse, discussing bedroom roles before she told you that she was mtf.  I just brought it up because it should always be mentioned that is a dangerous thing to do and i would discourage any young transwomen from doing that.

There is only one person you can be and that's the person you are.  I'm not clear, from what you wrote, how you identify and wonder if you have need to explore that more?  If 'packing' is a step toward transitioning,   you will have to discuss it with him at some point.  You said that you have been together for 7 years, but didn't say whether you love him or not.  It's a very complicated issue that many of us have gone through.  Unfortunately, I don't think that there is an easy or specific answer that anyone else can give you.  I can only tell you that I understand that feeling of being trapped between being who I needed to be and losing someone.

The one thing that we as a community have been fighting is society's stereo typical views of transgender women as sex workers, porn actresses for example...while we can do anything that anyone else can do.  I recently saw a ad on television where a young girl says...''girl power' at the end.  Well what we are seeing now, because of girls like Josie Totah is 'transgirl power'.

ask_transgender,fdxq6pp,t3_en9qsi,1578771705.0,"I came out my last year in high school and it was basically a positive experience.  I just wanted to fit in as much as possible, but I can tell you that the coming out process can increase anxiety levels, gender dysphoria, and at times, a fear of not being safe.  Being a 'normal' student, can be hard for transgender students.  I didn't expect special treatment from teachers and actually I feared that, as much as I feared negative treatment.  I didn't want to give other kids another reason to be hostile toward me...still, an occasional kind word, a gesture of support didn't hurt.   I guess like most of society, some teachers will be better at dealing with this issue than others.  I guess, all I can say is treat them as you would other students the best you can while understanding what they are going through.  I'm sure there is counseling available, but in my case, there wasn't anyone that had experience in dealing with transgender issues.  Is there s protocol at your school for teachers addressing this?

Maybe you should just talk to her about it and explain that since you were such good friends, you'd like her there.  On the other hand, asking a woman to a traditionally all male party, might give her the idea that you don't accept her as a woman.  I think if it were me, my femininity might be a bit threatened, but I'd also understand that it's coming from your heart.  Everyone is different though, so talking to her first is probably the best thing to do."

TransSpace,fdrsuj1,t3_emsaxl,1578689201.0,"What you said about 'feeling yourself' is something you need to explore more.  How do you think of yourself?  Do you see yourself as a woman?  Do you see yourself living your life as a woman and think that you would be happier doing so?  These questions aren't easily answered for some.  Society, the people in our lives, etc pressure us to fit into norms that most don't or even can't.  That can influence our feelings and the way we see ourselves.  What you've shared probably would probably ring true to many, both transwomen, and  feminine guys. Gender identity is a spectrum and not everyone fits neatly at one end or the other.  I know of people that transitioned and are completely happy and comfortable living as women, and also I know a couple that felt it was a mistake and de-transitioned.  I also know of very feminine guys that enjoy many of the things associated with being woman, femininity, makeup, clothing, traditionally female interests, etc.    I think the only advice I could give you is to find a therapist, counselor, etc that is experienced with gender identity, dysphoria, etc.  Someone that can help guide you to understanding yourself more.

I don't know any girls that have much more than I do.  There is always breast augmentation.  The reason for transitioning is more than just boob size.  There are a lot of beautiful cis women with small breasts and I don't think that makes most feel any less of a woman, or it shouldn't."

They probably have read about, or seen youtube videos of people 'de-transitioning' and feel like it justifies their anti-transgender mentality.  The truth is that transitioning is not for everyone and some do reverse back to their birth assigned gender, but the majority are happier living as transwomen/men.  I'm afraid it's part of being transgender.   What we all need to do it explore ourselves and live the lives we need to live."

Good luck and hope you find someone that you are comfortable talking with."
ask_transgender,fdg83j5,t3_ekw0mu,1578383996.0,"Transitioning is not for everyone.  It can and does affect every aspect of your life. If you have doubts then you should seriously consider stopping and getting counseling to explore your feelings more.  The reason i say to consider stopping is that as you said, some effects of hrt are irreversible.  Most of the girls i  know are very happy living their lives as women, but there are a few that decide that it's not for them and take steps to reverse their transition.  I strongly recommend counseling before  you make a decision.  Good luck, I wish you the best!"

Are you saying that you want to have a female body and 'fashion' meaning a woman's wardrobe, but intend to live as a male?  I'm just asking because there is more to being a woman than her body and wardrobe.  Taking hormones and especially having srs is a life commitment and should be treated as very serious.  My advice would be to find counseling, maybe through a LGBT center or something like that.  They usually charge on a person's ability to pay."

ask_transgender,fdbzngo,t3_ekgz2e,1578264377.0,"Unfortunately it's true.  Well you think we would find more support from a minority that has been the subject of much discrimination...which is why we're included in the lgbt spectrum.  However, while I grew up in the gay community, I do see a difference.  Most of the lgbt community is based on sexual preference while we are a sub community based on gender identity, so there is a difference that I often thought about when I was growing up.  In the end a lot of people look for others that they can look down on and feel superior to, so I guess that is we, the trans-community.  Having said that, not all of the gay community discriminates against trans-people.  I still feel more accepted and safe in gay related surroundings than I do in most of the straight, cis world."
