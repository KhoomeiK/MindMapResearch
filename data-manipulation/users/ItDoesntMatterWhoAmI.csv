Im sure not thinking properly right now but nothing sounds better than this at the moment"
offmychest,fcn75pz,t1_fcl4urr,1577805033.0,u know I dont hate myself or feel annoyed by myself. I just cant live like this and it makes me sad because there's nothing I can do about it. took no step forward in past 3 years and being stuck in hell. I planned it earlier today to go to mountains before midnight all alone and do it in peace and darkness so there wont be any chance that someone take me to hospital before I completely die
