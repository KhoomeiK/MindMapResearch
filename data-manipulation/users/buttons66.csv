puppy101,ffr0a01,t3_eund8n,1580147625.0,"Give this pup a chance. You didn't say how old it is. Puppies are babies. They don't come with knowledge already downloaded into them . Even if this pup is older you have to teach it to be house broke. If under three months, you are going to have accidents daily. They have little control over the call at nature. Calling it to you right now doesn't mean anything to the pup. Use it's name and watch, until when you say it the pup looks at you. This may take up to three weeks. Be patient and work on things slowly at first and don't expect perfection. Enjoy the next month of the cuddly puppy. You will miss it in about six months. You just won't miss cleaning up the messes."
doggrooming,ffqxl42,t3_euomsm,1580145919.0,"They don't want them sedated because they will be calm, and POW panic. If the dog thrashes around it may get hurt. The groomer may get hurt. And if the dog is a biter it just may turn and bite with no warning from a calm state. ( Not saying yours would, but I have seen it happen. A groomer alone in the shop could be seriously hurt.) Also is that Xanax prescribed for the dogs?  If not don't use it."
dogs,ffqlw8l,t1_ffppnon,1580138097.0,Yes they can. They don't have to lock. And some locks last as little as two minutes.
Pets,ffmf6z0,t3_eu31a8,1580053735.0,"We had a black lab that would lunge and bark at people. He loved to see them jump. He would quietly wait for them to get close and BOO. He thought it was funny. You could tell by how he acted after. He only did it when we were not near if he was left in the back of the pick up. Or at home, but only to the one neighbor. Very friendly otherwise. He had manners, no jumping on people, but every once in a while."

puppy101,ffi4fjj,t3_etq2ae,1579964785.0,"Most people go by the size of the pups feet as to how big they will get. So having the thicker bone structure and being a puppy, so to them he looks like he will be of monster size when grown. And to most people who are not around large dogs, anything over 35 pounds is of monster size."
AskVet,ffi3eu5,t3_etisud,1579963936.0,The eggs as you know by now the raw eggs won't hurt her. My dogs and cats get to clean up dropped eggs. It is a treat to them. People used to feed them regularly to their pets for a shiny coat.
bestoflegaladvice,fffj5oo,t3_et53be,1579885089.0,"The dog is stolen. Report it as such.
 Police will have to do something then. This happened here locally. Local shelter was capturing cats and stealing dogs ( or at least taking in lost pets that were actually stolen ) and refusing to give them back. Then telling the owner that they spayed/neutered the animal because their vet lied to them about it being done. Local vets hate this place. But the community thinks it is awesome."

puppy101,ffcbjyf,t3_estn5o,1579795894.0,"The potty problem is probably because it isn't home. Some dogs prefer to go in familiar places. And some get used to one kind of surface.  ( Know anyone who can only poop at home?) It may take a bit to get the pup comfortable to go were ever you are. Be patient. And taking the dog with you since you obviously can is great. But once it gets warmer your going to have to leave the pup at home. I don't know if you leave the car for any period of time, but even leaving the car running with the air on,, if the car stopped running the car will over heat in minutes. A husky in the car in winter will be happy. Just watch for destructive behavior. And make plans for the future when you can't take the dog with you now."

doggrooming,ff9s5u3,t1_ff9f78f,1579720027.0,"Could have been head, which is what I read at first glance. But in grooming that is very possible. My first grooming job was at the owners house. She had washed her hair and had it in curlers. She was washing the first dog and squeezed the anals. It went right into her hair."
doggrooming,ff9bety,t1_ff8dzj8,1579709124.0,"My K9 ll is 28 years old and still going strong. I just looked at the three and it looks interesting. They both have two moters so you can soften the speed for sensitive areas, and power up for the body. Circuited is the same thing, so while looking for deals don't pass on them if a better deal.  ( Think GMC vs Chevy. Same factory, just different sticker slapped on it)"
puppy101,ff96b1d,t3_esbyyg,1579705863.0,"The "" potty training twice "" is from teaching them to use a peep pad, but then teaching to go outside. It is easier to just potty train to go outside.  I can see using pee pads for small dogs if you live in an apartment and it is not convenient to quickly get outside, and you plan on using them for the life of the dog."
puppy101,ff956he,t3_esc02l,1579705104.0,Slicker brush and comb. I've seen mention of YouTube videos that show you how to line brush your dog. Or find a groomer who will show you. This time of the year they have a little extra time. I like the round slickers for getting into more angles easier.
doggrooming,ff94e2y,t3_escs52,1579704567.0,"Aahh. The three P's. Peed on, pooped on and puked on.  They usually come in threes also."
germanshorthairs,ff03u1s,t1_fezmhyd,1579464866.0,She has never hurt the cat. She just wants to chase them.  They are notorious for the the leash pulling. Start with one command a week once you get her/him home. And find a trainer and enter classes asap. You will have a well trained dog before adolescence starts. Don't miss daily training just because the dog knows the commands and you both are bored. They will backslide and do as they please given a little slack. You'll hear about enforced naps. If nothing else enforce quiet time an hour before your bed time. Or the dog will be wired. Ours really wasn't as bad as the horror stories I was told. Except for the above mentioned dragging everything outside.
insaneparents,feyl09y,t1_fey2ka8,1579446981.0,"You can usually tell here on the states also. Land lines usually have local exchanges. But even if I put my cell number on something even marked cell. I still get asked if they can ""speak to buttons66 please."" Doctor offices and businesses do this as professional manners. You don't assume that the person who answered the phone is the one you are looking for unless you know them. We have had people call answering an ad and they even check to make sure they are talking to said person. The ""may I speak to so n so"" is and should be very much a thing.  Anyone in the house could answer."
insaneparents,fevrghn,t1_feug246,1579400636.0,"Why? If it is a land line, anyone in the house could pick up."
dogs,fevmik9,t1_fevgnvk,1579399115.0,Butter is good. I don't blame him. Mine doesn't hide it. Just eats it. Or the bunch of bananas. Or the bread. We put up a baby gate. And even though my husband doesn't like it I pulled out the butter bell.  If you regularly leave your butter out ( as we do) get a butter bell. Your butter will stay soft and covered. It will stay fresh up to a month if you put water in the cup. No air gets to it.
sewhelp,fet3iqg,t3_eqihzg,1579371465.0,"You could also get stick on guides, or use a wide rubber band. Painters tape. I'm having trouble remembering the other ideas o found. I have trouble sewing a straight line also. The rubber band idea works if you have one. I've tried it. I bought guides that are in two pieces. You can use for a straight stitch, or a curved one depending on how you place them on the machine. The backing is sticky, but easily repositioned.  Can't find mine right now but bought it at Joann's."
puppy101,feo1ywz,t1_fen273a,1579294093.0,"Processed food is bad for us and them. You can lighten up a little on the food restrictions. Just stick with as close to raw as you can. Obviously cook the meat. But a bite of fruit or veggies is ok too. I will share steamed veggies with my pups, or give raw before I steam them. And they all demand I share apples and bananas. I bought a bunch last month and they disappeared. Husband found the skins behind the front door behind his muck Boots. Pup had stolen them. Apple wedge in the Kong is great."
puppy101,feo09kg,t1_femu9tv,1579293394.0,"I think this was more that most people didn't train the dog to also release the toy when told. If the dog wasn't taught to stop when told it may turn into a real battle and destroy something it shouldn't have. Or you end up with no socks. It's cute and easy to play tug of war with a puppy and let it win, but if the dog is not trained that tug of war could end up as aggression."
Pets,fenvuy4,t3_eq4exm,1579291701.0,Maybe use a piece of thin board such as luan to cover the bottom of the couch. You can also get sticky tape to put anywhere the cats are scratching that you don't want them to.  ( Made just for this. Won't damage the furniture when removed)   Spray bottle. Hitting them doesn't work so don't bother.
Pets,felz762,t3_epuovs,1579234749.0,"You need to find him a new home. Dalmatians don't always do well with children under 5. Once your child becomes mobile (if not before) this dog is going to go after him/her. This happened to a family member. Though their dog showed no aggression before. Was good with kids. Just not the one living in his home.  If the vet can't find a medical reason for this, he needs to be rehomed. This is not your fault. The safety of everyone is more important. Including his. Because if he seriously hurts one of the other dogs, you or your child the results and guilt will be ten times worse. Knowing he is homed and happy will be be bitter sweet, but preferable. Again this is not your fault."
puppy101,fek49q0,t1_fej2hfh,1579192290.0,"That probably would work for the best.  I know when I was working 10 - 13 hour days, I had no energy to deal with the pup. But my husband could. At least the dog is outside and can run around and not inside and having to behave quietly. I have no problem crating but I have never had to crate my pets daily for long periods of time. Most of my dogs wouldn't mind laying around all day at all once they were more than a year or two. You also may want to try a puzzle or snuffle matt to feed her. I never thought they were all that, but our pup is so energetic and I'm not. She loved it. And now the old dog we took in likes it too. It surprised me how excited a 16 year old dog could get over it. He is usually quiet and undemanding. Even when he hides during thunderstorms. Your dog will be fine."
puppy101,fej1vn6,t3_epd84l,1579153874.0,"Were does she stay while you are at work?  Inside or outside?  Do you live in the city or country?  If she can run around outside while you are gone, and she likes to play ball, a tug ball may help. Our pup stays occupied for off and on all day with hers.  Sort of like a heavy duty fishing rod with a ball. But she believes the ball is life. 
I had a rott Shepard for 13 years. Was a wonderful dog. I miss him. I would love to have another."
puppy101,fej13ei,t1_fehzv16,1579153118.0,"Yeah. Enjoy the bell ringing after she connects the dots. Mine constantly rings it. But we have learned if she needs to go out or if she just wants out. If she needs to go, after the second time she rings it she will come give us a hard stare. It is nice if you you get busy and forget to let them out. Do you still have her on a food and water schedule? This will help you to know when she will most likely need to go. Persistence will pay off. It just may take a while. Everyone learns at a different speed."
ProRevenge,fehb84p,t1_fegvol3,1579112975.0,"Kindergarten was just becoming more the norm than an option at that time.  Basically it was mostly socializing the kids. We learned songs, games, colors, numbers and the alphabet.  We all went to kindergarten, but I know of some who didn't."
dogs,feh2cp2,t3_ep4081,1579107688.0,She may become irritable.  Imagine most of the quirks women get when they have their period. Same for dogs.  DON'T LEAVE UNATTENDED. Two seconds outside without you there could result in puppies in two months. Know people this happened to. Ran inside to get the phone. Never saw the other dog. Was very surprised two months later. My female hung out in her crate most of the time. Kept any mess contained.  Depending on how much she bleeds you may want restrict were she goes in the house.
Dogtraining,feh161l,t3_ep3rk5,1579106978.0,Have you taken the dog to a vet?  At this point you love the dog you had.  You fear the dog you have now.
dogs,fegy6u6,t3_ep3aj7,1579105159.0,Depending on the size I will feed three meals up to four to six months. Fazing out the third meal after three to four  months. Two meals after that until seven months to a year.  But you can leave them on two meals if you want or if it is a breed that has a high chance of bloating. I think the whole multiple meals a day are because babies eat small frequent meals. Adults can handle one larger meal a day. Two meals a day for a 5 month old is fine. Most of a feeding schedule is personal preference really.
ProRevenge,fegvd8v,t1_fegtk67,1579103375.0,And before 1970 kindergarten was optional.

DogCare,fe8vgur,t1_fe8a04d,1578931481.0,They will be fine. But on the plus side will probably not want to stay outside long. Out to potty and back in. You won't have to stay outside long at night to wait for them to potty.
declutter,fe8ua4l,t1_fe8h37u,1578930989.0,"And to break it down a little more, start with the smallest room or closet. Then start from the left or right of the door and go around the room."
GSP,fdplaut,t1_fdpbvvl,1578631793.0,"Three meals for a puppy under six months is common. I always went with three meals til six months, for dogs who will be considered big (40+ pounds) give or take then two for a while and one meal after a year. This may be out dated, but but doesn't hurt. You just adjust the amounts for the age and weight of the pup as it grows. This pup is 3 months. We recently changed brands and our 10 month old gained and filled out. She wasn't overly thin and looked good, but in a summer way. It's winter, and I like the fact I don't see ribs when she moves. She is still very sleek, but looks good."

GSP,fdo41g3,t3_embkys,1578598504.0,"Our GSP never ate quickly. And we have had dogs that would leave food to munch on through the day. You may be giving him more than he wants at a time. My husband started giving ours twice what she needed per day. Then panicked when she wouldn't eat after two days of that. Just because he is under weight doesn't mean he is going to eat like there is no tommorow. Give three meals. If the bag says 2 cups, split that 2 cups into three meals. Don't add extra. But give treats. If he was normal weight, you would want to figure in the treats with the 2 cups."
dogs,fdg4929,t1_fdfx6vu,1578379419.0,They may not have had permission to walk the dog.  Children do things they are told not to. But at that age should have had better supervision so they couldn't do it.
dehydrating,fdg3r1m,t3_el61bg,1578378885.0,Keep the garlic as is. Powder it as needed. It will hold it's flavor better. Same with onions. And open a window when drying onions. FYI

Pets,fcy3gsb,t3_ejhk66,1578074265.0,"This is probably what a lot of new mother's feel after they get home with their baby. You just need to learn to adjust to the situation of a small life being dependant on you. If you do not have help for your anxiety and mental health already, please get it. Cat are usually easy to get along with as they understand not wanting to be bothered and attitudes. But also know when you need it. You wanted the pet for many good reasons. Look at those reasons and work through the feelings you are having. Bounce reasons off a friend and see how many of your concerns are poo pood. If you give it time on two months you will wonder why you ever considered giving it up."

You wouldn't need anything as strong as an essential oil anyway. That would make it to easy.  Anise is the doggy equalivant to catnip for cats. I have a recipe for dog treats that contain anise. Didn't notice it affecting the older dogs but they loved them. (Of course they eat anything I hand them) Haven't made them for the pup. May be a good idea to mellow her out."

doggrooming,fcmg8ep,t3_ehuuzt,1577774095.0,I recommend everything everyone has said. Plus find a groomer you can talk to and get tips from them.They will gladly show you anything you want when it comes to keeping the dog brushed out. Anything to make their job easier when you do bring it to them. Also the dryer will as lulupink16 said pay for itself. Use your imagination and you you will find many uses for it besides dog drying.

Pets,fcm6qia,t3_ehx4dv,1577765671.0,Those dogs did not need to draw blood to hurt that small of a dog. Check her gums to make sure she is not in shock. Feel her over gently and see how she reacts. If you think she may be hurt call or go to the vet.
