Edmonds would be a strong choice as well. I hate the guy - but he had a great career, hit the long ball and won some series.

But, when it comes down to it, I will tell you - Edmonds. Kenny grew up in East Chicage and Torii in Arkansas. Edmonds grew up in Fullerton, CA - I would rather grow up there."

ockytop,fdohwgb,t1_fdnaabd,1578605479.0,"A lot of DC is transient - so tons of Vols all over the place. If you need some recommendations on things to do the r/washingtondc sub is helpful.

The food scene is getting better, still not NYC amazing but you can find some good hole-in-the-wall places. A litteri at Union Market if you want one of the best italian subs in the city. 

Pizza here sucks. 

Tons of try-hards but the people are really nice. ""What do you do"" or ""who do you work for"" is basically the way of saying ""hello, how are you"" around here. It's a northern city with a southern work ethic.

U street, Adam's Morgan are great places for nightlife if you're young. H street and Eastern Market if you're just a bit older. Union Market is DC's attempt at something like Terminal Market in Philly. Chinatown if you can find what was left of it, a basketball/hockey game or a fuddrucker's with mandarin lettering on the outside. Georgetown is a great place to boutique shop or eat at night - pricey though (be warned, you will want to kill yourself wading through throngs of students on small sidewalks). Georgetown is actually nice but in the middle of nowhere even though it's in the city. Northern Virginia is fine - more cookie cutter pre-fab city but less expensive to live. Maryland is basically the same. 

Metro is usually fine, but people will complain about it incessantly - uber is a godsend considering how the metro lines are laid out. Call the orange line the ""orange crush"" (you'll get it if you need go take it in the mornings) or say the red line is awful and you will fit right in.

Bbq sucks here, so don't have any illusions about that. People will tell you Hill Country is ""good"" but it's just mediocre at best and awful at worst. Take advantage of the city's museums, don't fly into dullas if you can avoid it, SE is not a place you want to get stranded, Capitol Hill doesn't have roaming street gangs anymore, you WILL take seeing the washington monument and national mall for granted, then you will randomly look at them again and realize how amazing it is to see them, russia house probably is bugged by the FSB.
