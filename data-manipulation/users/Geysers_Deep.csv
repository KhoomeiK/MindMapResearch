depression,fessqka,t3_eq1xd4,1579368634.0,Maybe if you weren't so proud of your brain for having such an awareness...
depression,fe9nf63,t3_en2qbu,1578939727.0,"I was just like that, now I'm not."
depression,fe9mqvu,t3_eo7kg2,1578939488.0,You don't need a reason to get depressed. It happens biologically too. I'm sure every doctor is aware of that. So please just go see a doctor.
depression,fe7t2fx,t3_eo2nrq,1578918962.0,"Let me say this, noone could do any better than you did in your life when you had depression. It seems like your family can't quite handle it when they don't look sacred. If they don't allow you seeing a doctor, maybe you could try Ginseng which is a herb, not a medicine, so that they probably won't realise what's going on. It works everytime I take it and gives me the energy that I need. Just don't forget to keep it as a secret."
depression,fe7ntpb,t3_enljcj,1578917178.0,"I don't wanna sound like a rude person, but sometimes all you can do is getting dirty, as noone was created as perfect. It's not humane to try to keep your being sacred. So please go see a physician whenever you can, you don't wanna deal with a disease when you can heal it. You can also IM me because I had almost every kind of mental disease and I'm at a point where I should clean only the superficial remains of them."
depression,fe6owol,t3_eno7v3,1578898680.0,"Simply going to church and praying doesn't give much results. There are many topics to consider before turning into a whole-hearted believer, which only then you can expect answers for your prayers, as the first one to consider is loving God no matter what. It was hard for me to do that because there are so much wrong going on in the world and I was partially hesitant to accept these hardships, but then I learned that God doesn't give us burden beyond our ability to cope with and many more.

There are more information in the Bible to perfect your faith so that God will want to help you around depression (not that He doesn't do it right now). If you don't wanna read the Bible, you can check out the articles around any issue. Two years younger me would probably think that I'm messing around with him, but there have been so many things that I came across to help me rid of my depression."
depression,fe3ggte,t3_enpkpp,1578849058.0,"There are many causes of depression that I don't understand why doctors miss out on those. I'll just paste my list to get over depression:

	• Try every kind of medications other than SSRI's if you already tried them, including dopamine boosters for increased energy. Because you maybe supressing a disease by being depressed too.
	• Exercise regularly. It makes you feel energetic and eases the pain.
	• If you don't feel energetic, lack of vitamins and minerals, and protein might be the problem.
	• Get immersed in spiritualism, but sound ones only. If you're a Christian, just reading the Bible puts you into a different mindset, which helps you to view events in a different way.
	• Have you watched the movie ""Inside Out"" ? Take their advice seriously. Listen to dramatic or sad soundtracks and you won't believe what just happened."
depression,fe3f17o,t3_enpmmu,1578848719.0,"I think you should start with listening to music like you did, but the sad ones only. You should set your emotions free so that they don't bother you anymore. Just skip the ones with lyrics, they probably won't have a relevance with your distress."
depression,fe367n4,t3_enp4k1,1578846355.0,"I'll just copy+paste this list of mine:

	• Try every kind of medications other than SSRI's if you already tried them, including dopamine boosters for increased energy. Because you maybe supressing a disease by being depressed too.

depression,fe349ul,t3_enp68o,1578845808.0,"Besides seeing your doctor, I would listen to sad music, but not with the lyrics. You have to process your emotions that way."
depression_help,fe1zvbj,t3_enlsbn,1578832883.0,"This is rather unconventional, but listening to music about your feelings, just for the vibes, can help you release your emotions."
depression,fe1ivaw,t3_enlgfp,1578826996.0,"Assuming you're gonna start using drugs, dramatic kinda music helps people release their emotions, as it does for me too."
depression,fe1gvx3,t3_enlgrg,1578826380.0,"Maybe try some drugs against uneasiness, like Atarax or Akineton."
depression,fe1g5yx,t3_enlic8,1578826152.0,Maybe drugs against uneasiness rather than depression will help you better. Once it's gone other diseases seem to be resolved by themselves. Trying Akineton and Atarax made things much easier for me. I don't know why so many doctors rely on only 1 kind of a drug.
depression,fe1ef2z,t3_enljcj,1578825572.0,I think it's the uneasiness feeling that you're trying to escape. It must be feeling like you're not doing the right thing to the unwanted side of your brain. Akineton and Atarax helped me around this issue but I don't know how they differ.
depression,fe0uw1d,t3_enjto6,1578818963.0,"If you're willing to commit, I've got a list of what best worked for me during my years long depression:

	• Try every kind of medications other than SSRI's if you already tried them, including dopamine boosters for increased energy, drugs for bipolar disorder, uneasiness and anti-psychotics (they're not just good for paranoia), because you maybe supressing a disease by getting depressed. 
	• Exercise regularly. It makes you feel energetic and eases the pain.
	• If you don't feel energetic, lack of vitamins and minerals, and protein might be the problem.

Christianity,fe0tosy,t3_enjuj3,1578818560.0,"God doesn't wanna stress you either, He doesn't give a burden to someone that he can't yet handle. So pressuring yourself to not sin is a misstep, just build your strength gradually."
depression,fe0rww9,t1_fe0mf0r,1578817918.0,"Ginseng isn't a drug, it's just an herb so you can order it online. It really helps with depression. When you can go out, I'll suggest you more of useful things, just IM me. I overcame almost every mental disease so I'll probably have an answer."
depression,fe0h06d,t3_enjwl2,1578813300.0,"Seems like you tried some kind of drugs. But out of all the drugs I used, Efexor was the chosen one for me."
depression,fe0glyp,t3_enjypm,1578813122.0,Perhaps you can buy some pills on the internet if you can. If they don't sell drugs I suggest taking the herb Ginseng which gives you energy.
depression,fe0gbls,t3_enjzuj,1578812972.0,"Doctors usually ignore this, but getting your nerves alive is sometimes your best bet. Piracetam, which I only took because of trying something different helped me to come back to myself after years of living numbly."
depression,fe0fnot,t3_enk101,1578812623.0,The drug Piracetam might help you to get to yourself. It brings your nerves alive.
depression,fe0f7eq,t3_enk1ag,1578812375.0,Actually it seems like more of a numbness rather than depression that you're having. The drug Piracetam made it vanish from me. I'm certainly gonna increase the dosage when I get over the side effects because it just gives you life.
depression,fe0ei1u,t3_enk1au,1578811893.0,"You're just quoting from my previous self. I think it's uneasiness that messes things around. Using Atarax or Akineton might help. I they don't, I have some other ideas which could help. IM me if you'd like."
depression,fe0e2nd,t3_enk1ov,1578811480.0,"It could be some kind of uneasiness that you might have, like I did before. Atarax and Akineton are two drugs that make you feel at ease in different ways."
depression,fe0duuq,t3_enk1v7,1578811238.0,"Well that brings us into a well-known answer, that you have to change your mindset with spiritualism. It was scientifically proven that getting involved in spiritual activities, sound ones of course, make you feel like a new person. If you are a Christian, only reading the Bible can change your attitudes, which happened to be for me. Start slow if you want to, but in the end I guarentee it will change how you feel."

depression,fdna8m2,t3_emahw3,1578581357.0,This could be due to some kind of uneasiness. You might never be having peace wherever you are. Atarax or Akineton helped me with this issue in different ways.
depression,fdjvlst,t3_elqwy9,1578488962.0,"I guess I was depressed to supress my psychotic feelings. Now that my depression is improved, when I try to quit my antipsychotics, I get restless again. I have no complaint though, I can take them forever since it's gonna help with my psychosis."
depression,fdgn48b,t3_el7p7n,1578402840.0,"All I can do is giving you this analogy: Don't live in your body, but live on your body, like it's a vehicle for your soul. You might miss some superficial feelings, but it's gonna be a much better life than you're having right now."
depression,fde7r4w,t3_ekwigy,1578333029.0,"You need a dopamine enhancing drug for energy. Doctors, for some reason send you off with SSRI's which make you confident but not energetic. The best one that worked for me was Efexor. Hope this helps."
depression,fde5ab6,t3_ekwoa3,1578331489.0,"I almost cried reading this, cause I was in that situation too. During those years I tried everything and I wanna list them all which works the best:

	• Try every kind of medications other than SSRI's if you already tried them, including dopamine boosters for increased energy, drugs for bipolar and anti-psychotics (they're not just good for paranoia), as there are many causes of depression. And for anger Seroquel would be your best bet.

depression,fde3shn,t3_ekwp82,1578330544.0,"Those SSRI kind of drugs just make you feel more confident, but what you need is actually dopamine increasing drugs like Efexor which improves your energy levels. Also exercise makes you more energetic too. I need both in order to feel good. So please ask your doctor about it."
depression,fda6yh7,t3_ekexd1,1578242444.0,Awkwardness maybe caused by uneasiness. Akineton really helped me to relax around that issue.
