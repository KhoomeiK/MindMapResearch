* The FCO and/or Dominic Raab should elaborate as to why they have changed their advice and raised it to this level

* If you have chosen to live in another country, and marry another nationality, there is *always* the risk of becoming a prisoner of geography if you don't get the visa or immigration paperwork for spouses and children.

If you want to learn more about it and what is covered, [you can read this from Stonewall](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/harassment-workplace).

Some ideas about what I would do...

* Try to make notes of specific racist and homophobic comments made, and in what location and context.


* Until you can set up a meeting with your manager to discuss it, document every single further time something is said that you feel falls under the scope


* When speaking with his manager, make it clear you haven't discussed this with your boss already, nor anyone else at the company and you would like to have anonymity when it is discussed by the both of them 

* Find out what steps will be taken to address this issue and in what sort of timeline.

* If your boss takes it badly and takes it out on you... Document it. Document everything. If you feel your have to resign for a hostile workplace, you can apply for constructive dismissal.

Any large organisation should have HR measures in place to stop this sort of employee in their tracks - discuss their issues, try to change their behaviour, even send them on a sensitivity course.

If it's a smaller business, they might not have this sort of thing in place but it absolutely doesn't mean they should take you less seriously.

The only sort of ""toxic"" part of that sub and r/cats is the occasional vitriol against people who let their cats outside, and it seems to usually be Americans who make that comment. Yes I get there's wild animals in the US who will take cats, but for a lot of other countries, letting your cat outside is 100% normal and low risk.

I was recently involved in the rescue of a cat who showed up in my compound. He was super loving and friendly, even tried jumping on a delivery guys scooter to go home with him. He'd been spayed and was just a lovely boy.

Me and a few others trawled the lost pet groups in our area, and we took him to the vet, no chip. There's also a history of pets being dumped so we were not sure if he was lost, or deliberately abandoned.

We boarded him at the vet - we also all have our own cats so can't have him at our homes - and one of us went to see him every day and spent a good hour or two stroking him and playing with him.

We put up found cat posters, me and another girl even spent three days following up on a lead that an Aussie guy had lost a similar looking cat months ago - no one could remember any contact info, or find the lost poster but a few people gave a rough idea where he lived so we went door to door knocking with the poster, spoke to security guards and community leaders. We posted him online and loads of people shared it.

No one ever came forward.

We found him a foster home after being boarded at the vet for a week, and we gave him all his jabs and a microchip.

His foster eventually ended up adopting him but she knows one day someone might to claim him as their cat, but I am completely satisfied we did everything we could to find the owner at the time.  Unless they were completely useless, anyone in our area would've seen the found posters some how."

SVU,fg56jn8,t3_ew68hp,1580519519.0,"I would say it's because the character has become a shell of what she was at the beginning.

First off I have to say, the shows been going two decades, things were different back then. It's not perfect now, but definitely then there was still a certain attitude to women in the work place, strong women, career focused women etc 

And then of course the attitude to female rape victims - what were you wearing? Prostitutes can't be victims etc etc.

The character of Olivia Benson was a beacon of light. She was a role model to women across the globe. She was strong, independent, overcame a lot of personal issues and was still successful. She wasn't perfect, but she was a fantastic advocate.

You could even say the character has done a lot to shape attitudes in the US to sex crimes, and inspired many victims to have the courage to report their assault. 

The character was well written, and most importantly, the show was about SVU. Not about her. She was an integral part but it wasn't all about her.

Now?

It's like a different person. The show itself is more like a soap opera for a start. But now they've made the character a mouthpiece for the writers (and probably for MH) social justice causes rather than writing good police procedural cases.

And because the writing isn't as good, it's all a bit cringe and sycophantic. It's unnatural conversation when they drop in their comments about what the cause of the day is.

They've made it the Olivia show rather than a crime show. They've destroyed the character and made her holier than thou and everyone usually agrees with every decision she makes.

They use too much of her and personal life as plot device. Yes I know they did before with her brother but these past few seasons it's become so prevalent. And its just lazy lazy writing. It's a team of writers who seem to listen to the crazy fans on twitter and make episodes about their own political causes rather than writing a decent crime show.

Someone here the other day wrote that they wish SVU went back to how it was and I agree.

It needs to be more ""real"". It needs to have dead victims, it needs to have injustice, it needs to show that you can be a victim, do everything right, and you still don't get a guilty verdict. This is the reality of the law system."
