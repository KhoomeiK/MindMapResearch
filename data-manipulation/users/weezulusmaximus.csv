bodybuilding,fgo9dc7,t1_fgo5lha,1580963061.0,Well I mean I wouldn’t kick him outta bed for eating crackers. But he is a bit short.
aww,fghslub,t1_fgh7cun,1580792676.0,I don’t often hijack my way into the top comments but omg!! This is the best part of parenting. Watching these things become real people. And her reaction! I got this...no wait I need you...nope I got this! That was a mini emotional roller coaster for me.
interestingasfuck,ffsegh9,t1_ffschlj,1580179729.0,Or would you get rocketed backward?
aww,ffrpqlq,t3_eupxdq,1580163091.0,You probably invited it to dinner and he’s wondering why you won’t open the door. Rude
AmItheAsshole,ffrmndt,t3_euoks9,1580161197.0,Jeezus dude. Yes YTA and a disgusting one at that. I was SHOCKED when you said you were 32. I can only imagine what the house looked like with you and your roommates. You need your mommy to take care of you.
AmItheAsshole,ffrkaql,t1_ffqo7bn,1580159771.0,"What the fuck?!? You don’t actually believe that. You can’t be that dumb. You know why he doesn’t hide this from you?  Its not because HE is stupid. He knows you won’t fucking leave. He can go to this annual conference and do whatever the hell he wants. And if you think he didn’t fuck a hooker? Well I’m sure he did. I’d bet $1300 he did. And before anyone accuses me of victim blaming just stop right there. Cuz girlfriend you were the victim the first time. After you let it slide a second time that’s on you. He’s going to do it this time too and you know what? You’re going to be watching the accounts and statements wondering and if you don’t see anything you’ll still wonder where did he get the money because you know deep down he did relapse and he did go on a drug, alcohol and nasty hooker bender. I’m going to go with ESH because you’re setting up your poor daughter to repeat this cycle of codependency. Do better by her. That’s our fucking job as parents. To set the example. Set that bar higher."
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffr5vfi,t1_ffr5m21,1580151126.0,Lol you misunderstood me. I have no pitchfork. I was referring to the others downvoting me for a joke. Honestly I wouldn’t care if someone was judging me. Others opinions of me are none of my business.
memes,ffr0hk7,t3_eumpya,1580147754.0,"But really, why take that chance. YEET!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffr01wq,t3_euei4j,1580147483.0,Looks like I hurt some feelings lol
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffqybe4,t1_ffqpjv8,1580146378.0,Baby led “weening” is just that. Weening them from milk. At that age they also will put literally anything in their mouths. So it’s no wonder most parents have a decent amount of success with it. Toddlers are a whole new ballgame. They have likes and dislikes and a mind of their own. It’s almost like they’re real people. I just like to laugh at the “weeners” smugness. My kid eats just fine. I just take into consideration that a 2 year olds tastebuds are totally different than mine.
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffpqv79,t1_ffppo5l,1580102509.0,Those are super yum. You can add chia seeds to soak up extra moisture if you take out the protein powder.
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffpq29f,t1_ffppxn9,1580101760.0,It amazes me how many people don’t get jokes.
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffpoy6s,t1_ffpfavg,1580100757.0,Oh! You mean if I just tell my 2 year old “this is dinner” he’ll just eat it?? Holy shit. Why didn’t I think of that.
PublicFreakout,ffnni64,t3_eu6ncf,1580068187.0,I’m disappointed no one tackled her and or physically tossed her off the bus.

Roseville,ffczc8f,t3_er1on4,1579810365.0,"How does the homeless drastically spiking NOT point to the decline of a city? When you have to maneuver through junkies to get in to Trader Joe’s. It wasn’t like this years ago. I stand by my original statement. Roseville is an overpriced, overrated shithole in decline. Cirby and Riverside someone got stabbed by a a crazy homeless person with a butterknife. And ya know what? I know more than one person in that area that has watched the deterioration over the years where they now have more than one tweaker for a neighbor causing problems. But yeah it’s a great place to live lol."
Roseville,ff9h4du,t1_ff9gjd5,1579712897.0,You haven’t noticed our homeless population explode or the dramatic increase in mental illness wandering around? The police do a good job of keeping a lid on news stories but the crime rate is up too. You could google stats if you wanted to.
AmItheAsshole,ff6qnt5,t3_erskit,1579632859.0,How dare you put up a fence to keep my kids out of your yard?!?! Hah! NTA. So not the asshole
Botchedsurgeries,ff6q1kn,t1_ff6otum,1579632493.0,Yes that’s it. I’m “jelly” lol. Nah. I can afford this Walmart eye lift but I lack the body dysmorphia required to want to fuck up my pretty face. I can afford a reputable surgeon if needed.
Roseville,ff49gii,t3_er1on4,1579558447.0,You guys can down vote me all day long but it doesn’t make me wrong lol. Roseville is and has been going downhill for years.
bodybuilding,ff3d7ue,t3_er8rdp,1579538783.0,Guys I don’t care about the public announce. It was a joke. You all must be vegans.
bodybuilding,ff336ro,t1_ff2scry,1579532494.0,And we all know if you don’t talk about being vegan you’re no vegan at all!
Botchedsurgeries,ff20rps,t1_ff19y9y,1579490739.0,Obviously you’re not a cat though so....It’ll probably look just as dumb
Roseville,ff0fngx,t3_er1on4,1579468437.0,"Maidu area you may find something for that price. Stay away from old Roseville. There’s a lot of tweakers and homeless wandering around. West Park is nice but I doubt you’ll find anything for $400k. There is some new construction going up around Fiddyment and Baseline. That’s still a nice area as long as you stay on the Roseville side and not Antelope. 
Roseville is overrated and has gone downhill a lot in the 20yrs I’ve been here."
Roseville,felpgwt,t3_epefs2,1579227755.0,Hands down 4 Sisters.
worldpolitics,fecx8uz,t1_fecx7du,1578988295.0,Congrats. You missed the point entirely.
Whatcouldgowrong,fecvasl,t1_feauhmr,1578986035.0,I too was disappointed
worldpolitics,fecutz3,t3_eo5hvn,1578985499.0,"Obama golfed through his entire useless, race bating term in beautiful Hawaii. Politicians will always enjoy the perks of office. They ALL do."
BoneAppleTea,fecumcb,t1_fecud29,1578985258.0,Maybe you should figure out how to use it. Then it won’t be sitting around being “ extra”
aww,fecu32i,t3_eodytg,1578984653.0,I don’t know man. That white one looks a bit stage 5 clinger.
BoneAppleTea,fectwk1,t1_fecqjc9,1578984447.0,I’m sorry it’s only an inch.
AmItheAsshole,fdtnpgr,t3_emwxhd,1578719425.0,"He’s a “chef” and his specialty is lasagna?? Did you mean line cook at Olive Garden?
