It’s not the responsibility of the guest to account for your cost of living/inflation issues outside of their already expected tip (and even then, if they don’t want to tip...more power to them).  They’re already footing the increase in menu cost which is also an increase in tip (if tipping by percentage).  You also expect them to pay an additional arbitrary amount?  

Seeing as most of the states in the country also agree it isn’t the responsibility of the owners to cover your cost of living/inflation - it only leaves one person to cover your CoL/inflation issues:  YOU. 

If you want to make more money take more tables, give better service, work in a place with higher volume/menu prices.  

That’s how you make more money in the restaurant business.  

This is one of the only industries in the world where your ability to make money *scales directly* with how long and hard you’re willing (and able) to work.  Your income isn’t measured in hours worked, it’s measured completely in sales.  

I only have 24 years experience in the restaurant industry - so take this how you will."
