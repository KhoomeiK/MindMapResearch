college,ffgoakx,t3_etiwwi,1579910919.0,"Idk if it’s a public university thing or what but professors requiring attendance so far has been the rule rather than the exception. I have one professor this semester who takes attendance but doesn’t penalize us for absences since “it’s your time and money”, but everyone else takes points off our grade after a certain number of missed absences"

college,fff797p,t1_ffdyvmm,1579877490.0,"I think in most cases people who opt for this degree weren’t planning it from the start of their college career, it’s more for people who for various reasons might need a bachelors degree as a qualification for grad school, career advancement etc. but don’t have enough credits in any one area for a specialized degree"

I think lots of people feel this way though? I certainly do and I’m not ace"
GenderCynical,ffaza5y,t1_ff577m1,1579747954.0,Furries *aren’t* inherently a bad thing and I get a lot of furries are lgbt but that in itself shouldn’t really be a reason to include them in the acronym anymore than straight kinksters and polyamorous people.

In this context she’s probably referring to the jojo character

Edit: still supports your point though cuz she’s not the kind of character terfs like to stereotype trans women as emulating (like l*lis or catgirls or whatever)"

firefox,fehwud9,t1_feh1av2,1579125449.0,The new ff logo looks way more aesthetic on my desktop than this version tbh. None of the logos were bad but this version looks more like an over designed college freshman’s work imho. Idk if the hate of flat color logos is a reddit only thing but I do think there could be a correlation since it seems like redditors also like to circlejerk about how much they hate minimalist and abstract art.

GenderCynical,fdqknyj,t1_fdodve1,1578668975.0,"Ouch that’s unfortunate :( but yeah hopefully not common and even less so as methods improve. Also like, being fucking compassionate to trans women should be motivation in itself for a normal person, but apparently cis women who have had pelvic prolapse or intersex ppl require similar procedures, the more shit I see on this sub the more TERFs sound indistinguishable from incels and tradwives. It’s truly a reactionary movement disguising itself as progressive"
GenderCynical,fdobozh,t1_fdmspmv,1578602277.0,"I know very little abt the specifics of SRS but saying a trans woman’s vagina would taste like poop legit sounds like something a 5 year old would say. Like even if you used mucous membranes from the colon it’s not like you shit out of your vagina lmfao

Edit: also I totally forgot but has she never heard of ppl eating ass.... like if it tastes bad that has more to do with ur partner’s hygiene than their anatomy"
GenderCynical,fddyakm,t1_fdby1md,1578326915.0,"No I get what you mean. 

I don’t think any woman has any obligation to “like” men, be friends with men, center their communities and activism around men, etc. a lot of women simply just have been traumatized by men or don’t get along with them.

But TERFs (and even some people who aren’t TERFs) have this gender essentialist attitude that all men are by nature violent and oppressive and like.. if you’re a white woman, especially if you don’t experience transmisogyny, you have to recognize that it really isn’t ALL men who pose a substantial threat to you. An upper middle class, college educated etc. white woman wields way more power and influence in our society than a working class black man. Yes even if he is cishet. And black and brown men are inevitably going to be disproportionately demonized for their sexuality than white men. Like idk if I’m wording this in the smartest way but a lot of gender essentialism and/or female/lesbian separatism is not only transphobic but also rooted in white supremacy and homophobia."
GenderCynical,fddxhjp,t1_fdb2jpn,1578326360.0,"> Issue is applying the analysis only to sex work. Sex workers sell their body. So does everyone else in the working class. It's what our whole class has to do.

Yeah this. I stock shelves in a store, I don’t see how that’s not selling my body but sex work is"
GenderCynical,fddx50h,t1_fdcjw08,1578326127.0,"Whether or not sex work should or shouldn’t exist is an irrelevant question. The reality is that it does exist and is not likely to disappear anytime soon, so how can we ensure sex workers’ rights and safety? This is what I don’t get about a lot of leftist discourse... we can talk all day about how things ought to be in an ideal world, but what are we actually going to do right now?"
