subaru,fflxjfv,t1_ffiw6qo,1580045450.0,It was easier to design and print rather than keep looking on the internet. Just couldn't find them.
subaru,ffi8hwj,t3_etsefh,1579967821.0,I pulled a worn out transmission from my car and want to sell it for parts. This should keep it nice and clean inside for the next guy. I believe the older transmissions use a 30mm seal and it would be easy to resize this to the correct dimensions.
facepalm,fffao4l,t1_fff0are,1579879775.0,Look like a bigger cousin of the Blue Crabs we have on the east coast US.
Fixxit,ff9ok9d,t1_ff9hzh7,1579717351.0,"The relay or solenoid could wear during extreme low battery starting conditions. If the battery voltage sag by the starter draw is enough to release the solenoid, it can flap rapidly and cause a clatter. The flapping causes arcing and rapidly degrades the contact surfaces by introducing pitting and carbon buildup. This reduces the current that reaches the starter. In your video, the relay or solenoid is not flapping which is good. Or if the flapping happened in the past, that could also cause current drop at the solenoid and the battery still have plenty of capacity to keep the solenoid closed."
Fixxit,ff9enfa,t3_esb0rb,1579711375.0,"I doubt it, but another possibility is a burned starter solenoid or relay. Battery is likely the culprit though."
Fixxit,feuxe21,t1_fes2aze,1579390919.0,"Eh not really in need of a replacement if it's a steel sleeve cylinder. Check it with a magnet and if it's magnetic, ask your local motorcycle mechanic about local machine shops that can bore the cylinder and tell you what size piston to get. I've had great results rebuilding 3 different bikes and having the cylinder bored by a guy on eBay in New York. He's the cheapest on there. It would be faster if i had a competent machine shop nearby but I can't seem to find one that anybody recommends for cylinder work."

Fixxit,fekjame,t1_fejo5ve,1579201221.0,"If grinding a slot, be sure to use a manual impact driver. Whack it with a hammer real good and it should work those loose. With medium to large size Allen and Torx bolts, I've had better luck with welding a nut on. Let the bolt cool a while before lossening. Heat the surrounding area if it doesn't want to budge."

Art,fdfgxt0,t1_fdf9w01,1578361440.0,"You can just buy a decent cheap printer for $200. My friend bought an Ender 3 pro and had no idea how to use it, so I set up Octoprint on an old computer and hooked it all up so i can print over the internet from home. Now I'm taking the plunge and challenging myself to get good prints out of the $100 total piece of shit TronXY X1. I bought it fully expecting it to not print in it's original form. Should be interesting when it arrives next week."

blackmagicfuckery,fct2ugw,t1_fcsy1q6,1577931428.0,"Quality printer is going to cost over $300, a standard printer will cost around $200. As a beginner, if you don't know how to disassemble mechanical things and make them work properly, then get something with Auto Bed Leveling, and if you plan on doing large prints, something with a Filament Runout Sensor so it will pause when the spool runs out. Find something as small as you think you can go and with a glass bed surface, even if you have to buy the glass separately. Ender 3 is popular because it's so damn simple but it lacks many beginner friendly features i mentioned above. If you love to modify computers and other electronics, it's great. Not terribly difficult to add those features."
