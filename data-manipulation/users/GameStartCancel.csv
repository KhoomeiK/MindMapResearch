Stoicism,ffoo6nb,t1_ffoj13x,1580079827.0,"This would be a huge exception. But you are right, exceptions still exist. In those situations, we need to be exceptionally strong, to choose the right actions. Whatever happens in life, independent of how cruel the situation is, we must act, or react to the situation. The mice, defeating the lion, has nothing to do with his emotions. It remains that inner stillness helps you to choose the right actions, but in those exceptional situations it's exceptionally hard to remain calm."
