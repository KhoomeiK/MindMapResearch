ADHD,ffkmtsc,t3_etwpu5,1580025353.0,"Is it definitely not possible to follow her around for a week or two? Not to bark at her but to guide her through and also see where she keeps getting stuck? Maybe if it's the same things every time you could just check on her at those points to make sure she made it. There's one point in my morning that I screw up almost every day and I'm late almost every day just because of that one failure. I get stuck.

Could you set it up so everything is as easy as possible (like set up the night before) and amp her up to do it quickly, then when she gets done she can relax with a preferred activity until it's time to go? Like find some way to make forward movement more rewarding than whatever she's doing now?

When i was that age I just couldn't do it on my own. My mom would tell me to get dressed and get me started, then when she came back much later I'd just be sitting there staring at my sock. Every time. Like right now I've been trying to take the garbage out for about 36 hours. Have you heard of body doubles? It can make a big difference for some people, especially if they just need a nudge to stop daydreaming."
mentalhealth,ffklhqt,t3_eti547,1580024737.0,Apple slices or baby carrots and peanut butter. They travel really well. Mixed nuts or trail mix. It depends on your situation but things like canned beans/chili or oatmeal packets can be good as well. I used to do PBJs for most meals
ADHD,ffkl6oe,t3_etxlte,1580024591.0,"Environmental engineering and natural interruptions are the only things I've really had work. Like I mean if the power flickers and the computer shuts off, then I'm set free. Or if I set things up intentionally so stuff like that will happen. I'll literally almost pee my pants before i stop doing something interesting. Sometimes i don't even want to keep doing it it's just feeding some reward system. I just sit there getting more and more miserable wishing I would stop. Not helpful but it's better not to be the only one"

I use LaCroix bottles for water because they're $1, they're recyclable, they hold a liter and it's not heartbreaking when I forget them under the seat of my car and then I'm afraid to drink out of them later.

ADHD,ffkh92l,t3_eu1qyf,1580022729.0,"It feels impossible to almost everyone at first. I think people often get discouraged because no one is there to say it's part of meditation to be frustrated and think you're doing it wrong. Lots of meditation guides suck as well so it's harder to get a feel for it. I know it can be harder for us to stay on task but getting off task is a huge part of (mindfulness) meditation. I mean that getting off-task is a required part of meditation, not a failed attempt. Mindfulness meditation is when you try to stay mindful but your mind wanders so you start over. If you don't get off task then you can't learn to redirect yourself

Here's a guided meditation from kabat-zinn. It's pretty slow so it might not be for everyone. His recordings have been good for me because he makes it really clear that this kind of distractibility is normal and it takes practice to get good at coming back. Just like you wouldn't expect to be great at playing an instrument the first or second or third time. We're really hard on ourselves https://youtu.be/SkAMaCZtXUI"
ADHD,ffkfe1q,t1_ffk75li,1580021863.0,"I was going to say something similar--DSPD is associated with autism and ADHD. I've had it since I was in my late teens. There is treatment but whether it works depends on a lot of factors (like whether you're insensitive to melatonin or just don't make enough at the ""right"" times) and there may be side effects to playing with your hormones. The treatment (low dose melatonin and controlling light) kind of works for me but it also causes a severe drop in productivity because my natural go-time is still late night."
aspergirls,ffgrb9d,t3_etfz6z,1579913068.0,"I have the same issues. 

There's an expectation and complexity arc that goes with growing up and moving deeper into the workforce. So even if your skills stay the same you might feel worse about them if people (including yourself) are placing increased demands on you. I think my skills have gotten better but my ability to cope is in the basement because I have too much responsibility. I'm trying to find a way to change my responsibilities by changing jobs or going on at least short term disability. 

My skills have gotten better because I've watched a million videos and read a ton on all this stuff, especially things designed for ADHDers and autistic people. Like in the past I was ALWAYS late to appointments because I'd try to leave 45 minutes before an appointment that was 45 minutes away. So I started putting an earlier time in my calendar and tried not to look at anything official that would tell me the right time. People say you should leave 2-3x the travel time before an appointment so I try to do that. (I'm still late just not ALWAYS.)

I try to have clocks everywhere, and make a formal structure for what to do when, so when I see it's 5, my brain will think of all the stuff I wrote down by 5 o'clock. Otherwise 5 is abstract. It means nothing.

The thing I learned about planners is that they don't work for me unless they hold EVERYTHING AT ALL TIMES FOR EVERYTHING. Like I used to make a list of stuff I needed done before bed and put it up on the cupboard door where it was easy to see, so then I wouldn't look at my planner because I was focused on the cupboard list. NO! THE LIST GOES IN THE PLANNER! lol. Like you keep checking the planner because that's where everything useful is. I use clips to hold sections together so I don't end up flipping through irrelevant old crap. I'd really suggest putting anything you know you'll want to look at later in the planner, and then you'll keep checking in with it. This is one reason I use a small binder instead of a notebook.

We get good at being super efficient at putting out fires, which usually means tunnel vision on certain tasks but which can mean ignoring important stuff that isn't on fire. So like in the past I'd have a planner with important stuff in it but I'd put urgent stuff in my phone, so I'd know I didn't *really* need to check the planner, so I wouldn't compete any ""less urgent"" tasks that I didn't set an alarm for. I still set alarms but I've changed my mindset so I know the planner is the important part. Like on a task alarm I might put ""look at schedule"" instead of ""start chores"" or whatever. A lot of times the hard way is better. Like if you don't want to copy a task over and over then maybe it isn't worth doing so you should cross it off instead of putting it into an app and ignoring it. I fought this idea for many, many years.

Also I use a lot of bullet journal techniques (especially the iterative diy page layout), but for me at least it would be totally absurd to use a notebook. I have to use a binder or other loose-leaf binding. If you're bad at time management and tend to hyperfocus or drift off then it's basically sabotage to have a system where you have to flip through old stuff all the time to find needed references. 

I know this is ridiculously long but... Two of the biggest things are 1) if you're autistic and getting overwhelmed then you may have hit a limit you need to respect rather than trying to push through it. Like if you're doing too much, your mind and body may be rebelling because it's just too much regardless of management tactics. That's where I'm at. Realistically I have to have several hours every day to recover from my job, which makes a lot of stuff nearly impossible to get done. I've beat myself up over it for years but it's not something I can control if I don't change jobs

2) It may be hard to get things done because they aren't really that important or you're trying to do way too much for the amount of time you have. Lots of NT people say there should just be like 3 things on your daily list. Maybe if you track the amount of time you spend on things you usually do it would help you see where there are openings or where you could adjust your habits

Sorry it's so long but I am working through some stuff lol. Good luck!"

Sometimes I get so agitated or depressed from sleep deprivation that I start to consider doing something drastic, but at some point I realized I could usually attribute that stuck feeling to sleep issues and that made it a lot easier to say ""This feeling is temporary. You need to go to sleep. When you wake up it will be easier to figure out. Don't freak out yet."" Then I can make it until I can take a nap. In mindfulness identifying emotions and thoughts is a way to deal with them too. It can be really helpful. Even when I'm just grouchy it makes it easier to deal with if I can tell people and myself that I'm irritable.
