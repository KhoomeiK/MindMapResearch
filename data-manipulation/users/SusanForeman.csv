However, the majority of those make poor decisions, which lead to poor diet habits, which lead to poor nutrition and obesity.

**To answer OP's question**: You don't get fat without eating a lot, and often, of low-quality, high sugary foods. Once you start that kind of diet, it's extremely difficult to get off that diet because other foods taste bland, aren't filling, and are more expensive."

I would recommend a movie that fits in with his tastes - is he more of a classic literature kind of reader or modern book reader? How about an Audrey Hepburn film? Or an Alfred Hitchcock movie? 

If his distaste for films are the flashes and crashes of modern cinema, keep the recommendations slow and warm for him. Something more recent - Grand Budapest Hotel was quite enjoyable, or if adventure is more his style, can't go wrong with Indiana Jones. Raiders, of course.

Really it comes down to the genre - what does he enjoy in a story, and see if that translates to an enjoyment on the screen as well."
