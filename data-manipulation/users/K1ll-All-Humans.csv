He is anti-blacks, anti-hispanics, anti-women, anti-immigrants, anti-liberals, anti-non-christians, anti-science, anti-peace...

He's basically anti everything that doesn't describe him.  An old white racist conservative."

I am absolutely amazed that one Republican senator did.  Romney found a spine somewhere.  I don't know who's spine that was, but he found it."

The world would be a better place if they committed mass suicide, and part of me is still  holding out hope that a country wide repeat of Jonestown will be Trump's endgame.  Most of his followers would drink that arsenic kool-aid if Trump asked them to, and that would make America great again."

\- Donald Trump

&#x200B;

People with preexisting medical conditions are only covered now because of the ACA, which was passed by Obama and congressional Democrats.

Trump has been trying to dismantle the ACA for 3 years.  It will collapse soon due to the loss of the individual mandate, which Trump helped get rid of.   When the ACA goes, so do the protections for pre-existing conditions.  There is no other law that exists or is even proposed that keeps those protections.

The man is actively trying to take away pre-existing condition coverage while telling people he's protecting it.  And people are cheering him for it.  This is just fucking asinine."

politics,fgmzbdg,t1_fgmbn7p,1580934783.0,"Rush received the Freedom Medal for his contributions towards:

* Arguing that black people are genetically predisposed to be criminals.
* Arguing that women are less intelligent than men.
* Arguing that a woman's duty is to stay home and be pretty.
* Denying that the genocide of native Americans ever happened.
* Showing America that unions are scum and that the working class should shut up and take whats given to them.
* Arguing that science can't be real if you believe in god.
* Advocating for the use of nuclear weapons.

Don't act surprised.  These things are Republican virtues.

PoliticalHumor,fgmw8nx,t1_fgmficb,1580933221.0,"McKinley and Garfield both died of infection after being shot.   Garfield's was especially horrific.  His surgeons basically butchered  him trying to get the bullets out (he was shot twice).   He spent almost  3 months in agonizing pain before finally dying from infection.  His  last words were ""This pain, this pain.""

I like to bring that one up whenever Trump claims to be the worst treated president ever."
