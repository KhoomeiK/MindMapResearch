Showerthoughts,fghnt26,t1_fghmyx7,1580789130.0,"Online payment infrastructure is still wonky, honestly.  

A few years ago, when I was at college, I could use a BoA debit card online to pay my utilities.  It would fail roughly 15% of the time.  If I took the same debit card into their office and let them process it through their online kiosks (using the exact same website), there was a 0% fail rate.  

I would receive notification via e-mail either way that the payment was processed and approved, and online payments would kick out at the bank level despite being processed by the same systems.  As far as I know from newer students, that glitch is still in place.  

A simple call to the bank would fix it, but it was tedious to check to ensure the funds were actually deducted from the bank and then that they were processed properly.  (This was mostly because the processing time varied between 3 and 7 days.)

I wonder if it's just me or if the whole fucking world is going to end up putting a bounty on anyone with a kid growing in their gut.  Not like I can fucking ask, either.

Be funny if that's how the human race dies out:  people killing off all the preggers before they've got a chance to actually pop the kid off.  We go the way of the motherfucking T-Rex just because assholes want a fat bank account that won't mean shit to anyone in a few decades after people are too scared to actually have kids.

Not like you can run too easily once you hit the third trimester and the land of swollen ankles.  Double the pay for a single kill without having to fight for it?  Shit, people will probably be fighting to headshot women as they're puking up their guts once they're sure it's morning sickness.  Maybe they'll stake out Planned Parenthood or obstetrician offices.

Only the really sick fucks go after babies.  More go after toddlers, and teenagers are fucked if they aren't cold-blooded killers themselves.  But pregnant women?  Who really gives a damn?  It's just another bitch kept from breeding bastards if she's not wearing a ring.  If she is, her husband is a piece of shit that shouldn't be breeding to begin with.

You obtained poison and give it to them.  Their trust drops, or they leave the party.  Give them a knife, and they start daydreaming about stabbing your enemies.  Their regard for you increases.  


Giant Squid plushies give them the best stat increase because it reminds them of their dungeon dorms.  

...Except that one hard-ass Slytherin you can recruit.  They get quiet and homesick and leave your party at 2AM.  You find them three months later teaching Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts and drinking way too much firewhisky at night while talking about their friend who drowned from being Stunned and falling into the Black Lake during the Battle of Hogwarts.  The Giant Squid had fished them out but was too late."
harrypotter,ff8eofz,t1_ff7ox9j,1579675277.0,"As my mom was forcibly put in a nursing home with dementia, paranoia, Alzheimer's, and psychosis...this is 100% accurate.

You learn what to avoid and how to fake whatever keeps you from being treated worse.  As an example, for me, it was suppressing my emotions when my mother was near and training myself to forcibly flip my emotional state to almost manic happiness around other people so that everything seemed to be okay.

Abusers tend to isolate their ""toys"".  They are jealous and want to avoid suspicion.  (This was 75% of the forced happiness thing)  They keep you from having access to people and strip you of every dime they can so you are reliant on pleasing them for social interaction.  This also has a bonus benefit for the abuser--they can control who you interact with far easier.

Harry's generosity throughout the series and how he wants to repay kindness by giving people things (and a rather prevalent desire to share his wealth with the Weasleys) is partly a side effect of this.  He is naturally a generous person, but this is amplified by his neglect.  

Your view of yourself is so far in the gutter that you feel you have to constantly offer more than just yourself, that your companionship isn't enough to sustain a friendship on its own...or that human kindness is something you have to pay for because you've always had to trade *something* for it.

Self-reliance is a necessity under a trying home environment.  It allows you to survive and to avoid harmful attention.  Asking for help is taught to be a weakness and is punished.  Even if you find someone you trust and know is there for you, you shy away from asking for assistance because you feel that (1) you're abusing their friendship or that (2) you are a burden to them.  In your mind, your friends should get the better end of the bargain *always* because they are kind to you.  


Harry is *such* a well written character in this regard."
