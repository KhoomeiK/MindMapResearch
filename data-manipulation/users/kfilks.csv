AmItheAsshole,feiu6aw,t3_epa98w,1579147306.0,"NTA - fuck that mansplainer. Also if it ever got brought up to HR I would say he directly asked you ""how do you know...???"", Well chucklehead, I know because I had one... "". You just answered the question and if he didn't want an answer he shouldn't have asked. Also, he shouldn't have been talking about it in the first place if he didn't want to have a conversation about it."
dogs,fef6ttp,t3_eomrod,1579049555.0,"Totally agree- I will say though, people who are not 'a dog person' can still be great pet parents (in the right situation). I love my dog, live and breathe for my dog, take him just about everywhere with me and think he's the greatest blessing in my life but I don't really like other people's dogs at all. Don't even think they're cute generally, so I wouldn't consider myself a dog person. However, I also did my research before getting a dog and understood all that came with a puppy and was more than willing to take it on - best decision I ever made!"

AmItheAsshole,fe3sdxq,t3_eno5q8,1578852423.0,"NTA - First of all, it's rude to even inquire about your medication and he should mind his own fucking business.

AmItheAsshole,fcqsdot,t3_eifwhn,1577891463.0,"NTA - You didn't make a big deal of it, and everyone has the right to choose what they eat.

dogs,fc7b1zu,t3_egbn40,1577502296.0,"My thoughts on this are that if you know you'll be put in the place to possibly make the decision of paying a ton of money (that you possibly can't afford) or not caring for your dog, then perhaps you should be able to afford pet insurance so you won't be put in that predicament. I don't think it's saying that you need to have 10 grand to drop on a dog, but moreso that you should make smart financial decisions when it comes to getting a pet."

Otherwise I do what others suggested- stick to grabbing drinks (or tea if that's your thing), be casually upfront about your preferences and let the other person eat what they want at nicer places if they're a 'foodie' or whatever. Hopefully they won't pressure you to eat, but honestly if someone can't respect your eating habits then the probably aren't the one for you!"
