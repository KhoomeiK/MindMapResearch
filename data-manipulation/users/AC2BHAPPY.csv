Gotta say, your hella lucky it didn't blow up. It might take 4 or 5 refills to help clean it all up. I've heard you can add in Marcel mystery oil to the crankcase or seafoam, but that's up to you.

AskMechanics,ffb6fmf,t1_ffb2g09,1579753046.0,"I think what would help a lot is if you had the actual codes. Go to AutoZone or oreillys and have them scan your car. Write down those codes and when we have those we can help pinpoint issues.

As for low battery output... Check and make sure the terminals are tight. The battery strictly starts your car and sends a very very small amount of electricity to other sensors and units in your car while the car is not running. It's your alternator that actually powers everything electrically once your vehicles engine is running. Perhaps if the battery is old it might not have the same juice it used to have, but if it starts your car I would say it's still good."

Lookup a picture of an EGR valve, they're very distinct looking. If you can idle your car for a moment, squeeze the diaphragm on the EGR and your car should stutter or stall. Otherwise if it's easy to take off (usually 2 bolts), just take it off and inspect that the diaphragm is in good condition and everything can move freely."

AskMechanics,ffb1frc,t3_eslfb1,1579749409.0,"One possible culprit could be a vacuum leak. Blow smoke through your vacuum lines through the brake booster and see if smoke comes out anywhere.

I think an EGR valve malfunction can cause stalling and idling issues too, so make sure it's all in working order. 

If your timing chain is loose or busted I think that's a mandatory fix. It can be done at home, but it's not the easiest job.

I hope it's not your fuel injectors because those can sometime be super expensive, even if your doing the replacement yourself. For my old ass truck it's 100 bucks per injector, and they're not very easy to get to."
