It's a fairly safe debt investment in my view.

The Future group is well structured. And they'll be using the funds for their business activities. Spoke to a couple of managers too.

I'm not going to sit here and pretend like I know what the truth is. But if I had to hazard a guess, it seemed more like a case of women throwing themselves on someone rich looking for a payday.

Now, obviously most women aren't like this. But you have to admit that some women do pursue such abhorrent tactics."

I agree with you. I'm sure nothing compares.
