My guess is related to how complex the ""social reinforcement"" factor is. Whether other people react, over react, ignore... social reinforcement is almost impossible to avoid. Some people very much want no attention, others want to communicate and be noticed (though it's stigma to call self harm ""attention seeking"").

>As the gatekeepers of social media are wrestling with how to police this  trend, some suicide-prevention experts see a window of opportunity.  Typically, suicide memers aren’t mocking suicidal thoughts; they’re commiserating and *bonding*  over being suicidal. Morbid memes, these experts believe, may be a foot  in the door to one of the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach  populations: socially isolated young people.  
>  
>...  
>  
>“The very people we’re trying to reach, the youth—we’re telling them  they can’t talk about suicide the way they talk about it,” \[a suicidologist\] says.  “When you read the threads on these memes, people find them helpful.  They don’t feel alone. It’s a way for them to anonymously communicate  their inner pain in a way that’s artistic, super clever, and that people  who are struggling identify with.”  
>  
>\[The suicidologist\]  believes that decades of an effective “gag rule” on suicide stifled  conversation and perpetuated stigma—and that while the younger  generations are more willing to talk, there’s still a vestigial wariness  among listeners that the very act of discussing suicide could make  their friends *worse*.

.

>Online communities can reduce social isolation by providing individuals with a place to meet and receive support from others experiencing similar problems. The supportiveness of such online communities can lead to life-affirming experiences, even on websites advocating for suicide. Niezen suggested that negative effects arise from hostile environments where users post inflammatory responses intended to upset or ridicule others.
