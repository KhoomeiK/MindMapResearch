Again only starting s2 but so far she's been attracted to hella mailmen, Chidi, the monk dude (for like a minute), pretty openly flirted with Tahani and was somewhat into the lawyer woman from the 'middle place' upon seeing her. None of them were subtle or ambiguously hinted at, which is nice."

Do you mean bad weird or just regular weird? Because again, e.g being gay can be 'weird' to think about if you're straight, but there's nothing negative about it. Same with this. Bi people are also probably much more common than you realise btw"
bisexual,ffgiqyh,t1_fffmq7x,1579907170.0,"The consent is implied. It also wouldn't be nearly as funny a tweet if it said ""I FUCK WHOEVER'S PRETTY AFTER GETTING THEIR CONTINUED AND CLEAR CONSENT."" In fact you'd probably wonder why they had to clarify the consent part... and then here we are. Mostly it's just a dumb amusing tweet"

OnePunchMan,fffy7ww,t1_fffobxu,1579894401.0,"Always nice to see someone learning from a measured discussion on the internet :)

And yeah I think that's the main point. I could truly see where you were coming from (even if it might not be the most necessary place to say it) but if someone's abrasive about something, even if they're right, people tend not to listen to them. The way to change a receptive person's mind is, imo, with measured words and good logic. I do make it a point myself not to be heteronormative as much as I can too, because being seen as existant is nice, and you did remind me a bit of that. So thanks for that at least"

OnePunchMan,fffae9m,t1_ffepe18,1579879602.0,"bruh. I'm bi and I got the point... not everything that doesn't go out of its way to include bi people is bi erasure. They could've said ""people that like that"" or ""people that like men"" and been more correct than they are, but this is a colloquial conversation about something we all got the point on. The phrase is also kinda clunky so people are gonna be resistant to adopt it, even if they know about bi erasure. Maybe if they said ""women and gay men"" it'd be in order to nudge them in the right direction but this seems like splitting hairs over something mostly arbitrary."
replications,fff35pg,t3_esyg6y,1579874443.0,"This replication is pretty innacurate. The colours are all over the place without blending into each other, there's no drifting, and the double vision looks more like a dissociative effect than any amount of LSD.

TenseiSlime,fff2fo2,t1_ffel8fk,1579873875.0,"Because she's a popular character from a recently-aired anime, and is Actually An Ancient Dragon That Just Coincidentally Looks And Acts Like A Child™ so people (including the show's creators) draw them in often sexually suggestive ways.

comics,fff25jt,t1_fff162y,1579873649.0,"The thing is though, it's specifically the depression causing their perceived laziness through a lack of motivation, caused by a lack of reward chemicals even when they do something good for them. Many people actually do manage to overcome the 'laziness' part of their depression and lead normal-looking lives from the outside, but that doesn't change the fact that it's not their fault they're 'lazy' in the first place. It seems you understand that, but the solution isn't working to get less lazy, though that *will* help- the solution is treating the root issue, which is depression. 

Mostly what I'm saying is you've got the root issue wrong; it's the depression, and *then* all the personality/motivation/whatever issues. There are always edge cases and people who 'just toughed it out and did xyz', but that's never practically applicable to everyone. If something is in someone's best interest and they have every reason to do it and they're not, there's always a good reason for it. I think the only 'laziness' that should be discourage here is not getting help for their root issue, which will in turn help all the connected issues. And even then it's a struggle for most, because brains are complicated and mental health aid is underfunded and drugs don't work for some and not nearly enough people have access to drugs + therapy, which is by far the most effective method for treating this disorder."
comics,ffezihg,t1_ffeufue,1579871379.0,"They're incorrectly assessing their life, the world and themself, yes, but that's because their brain chemistry's all bonked up. For example, imagine you produce a tenth supply of a neurotypical person's 'joy neurotransmitter'. Everyone else can feel it, and you can sometimes, but it would take a ridiculous amount of effort for you to feel the heights of joy that others do. You can live your life, but you're missing something.

I've never been depressed, but I think that analogy can be loosely applied to depression; you can live your life (depending on how bad your chemical imbalance is) but your brain literally experiences things differently. You can go through the exact same situation as someone else, but feel a tenth as much... or an overwhelming amount of anxiety or despair or something else, brains are complicated. Now imagine an overabundance of 'joy'. You'd feel great about everything, right? No matter what happens. It'd make sense for this to go in the opposite direction.

Depression sometimes has an inciting incident, sometimes doesn't. Some people just *get* depression from much less than another might, through no one's fault but their genes. In those cases what's the 'real issue'? It can be caused by something like a death of a loved one or some depth of sadness, but it isn't just extreme sadness. If it were your argument would be much more correct, but fixing the worldly problem that caused it won't fix their depression, because depression by definition is a brain that doesn't see the world 'properly'. Overwhelming despair and/or apathy through no fault of their own but with people *telling them* it's their fault tends to encourage bad habits and laziness... both of which make it hard for people to seek help. Even disregarding that lack of motivation is one of the main symptoms of depression because your brain produces less motivation.

DISCLAIMER: I'm just a random internet layman, don't take this at face value. Some of it's probably wrong but I think the general sentiment's there"

Drugs,ffc3ord,t1_ff9k7ua,1579790762.0,"Hey, just wanna let you know that neither DXM nor meth release serotonin, and the only risk of serotonin syndrome here is with repeated high dosages of DXM in the same day. Meth doesn't add to or take away from that risk; it works on dopamine, but that does N O T mean either is any good for you (And I think it's still neurotoxic). DXM is kinda neutral until abused, which you appear to be doing, at which point it's quite unhealthy. Meth is... meth. Not worth it. And yeah, audio hallucinations are possible- even likely- on both substances, and it's not unheard of for the nature of one's hallucinations to suddenly change. HOWEVER, you're probably also going down a rabbit hole that'll make these hallucinations more frequent and intense, so imo you should do everything in your power to quit while you're ahead. Good luck"

replications,ffbq72k,t3_es88og,1579778209.0,"This isn't very accurate imo. The 'swirling' in the foreground and background is too exaggerated without the accompanying colour shifting and it's too random vs a psychedelic's somewhat uniform drifting. Kinda looks like a smudge tool was taken to the image. Also is that a patch of copy-pasted void on the ground? I do like the mirroring and fractalisation in this, but its issues (mainly lack of colour or accurate drifting) hold it back."
