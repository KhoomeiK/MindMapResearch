Warhammer40k,fexsfxk,t3_eqvh1c,1579435423.0,"I got the three Primaris Space Marines and some paints for Christmas and have spent the intervening time acquiring tools and a magnifying lamp.

I made the mistake of painting each part individually before assembly, which made that a bit tricky. I also forgot to shade but I’m not sure it looks too bad.

I think the highlight lines are a little thin but I wasn’t sure how many edges to do so kept it simple. I also tried to highlight the Blathazar Gold with Gehennas Gold but don’t think it made much difference, as far as I can see anyway.

The head is a daunting prospect.

I find myself fighting the bristles on the paintbrush and also struggling to get a consistent paint thickness/thinness. I do use a wet palette but I think it’s my paint-fu which is lacking.

Should I use ‘ardcoat or stormshield to prep for the decals?"
