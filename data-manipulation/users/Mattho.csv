What I mean is that when I connect (or to be fair used to connect, my current phone doesn't do this), the phone detects that I probably need to sign in and decides to notify me and asks me if I want to sign in to the network. Now, this is where the trouble begins. When I click on the ""Sign in"" button, the OS tries to open google's https homepage in a web view. Of course the underlying browser won't display it - as the certificate is missing or does not match the domain. Now I have to close this, open a browser, and use a different - non-ssl url.

I don't see how using Google's homepage as an attempt to get me to the sign in page is not the fault of the OS.

By the way, it often isn't a redirect. The router just responds with the sign in as a content. But even when there is a redirect, it would get blocked as that's still an invalid response."

Like zero effort from the system to actually let me sign in.
