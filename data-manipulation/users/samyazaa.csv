tifu,feszh3w,t3_eqf0gs,1579370460.0,Yahhhh there’s a reason bing has so many memes about it. Like for instance I think I saw a meme where user googles how to get help with depression or suicide and google gives the suicide hotline numberor something. Then same user types it in on bing and bing gives different options about how to kill yourself. Just stick to google search or at least search engines that don’t have memes depicting how unfiltered they are.

science,fdrop8b,t3_emtrov,1578687475.0,"Growing up my dad had rifles in the garage unloaded but with ammo nearby in boxes where we could’ve easily loaded them. Unlocked. I never rly did anything with the guns. When I was 12 I went and held them and looked at them but I knew how to load them already and where the trigger was and what not to do with it because when I was 10 we went to a farm and he taught me how to shoot a pistol and then he taught me the force behind a shotgun when we shot skeet. I wasn’t really anxious to pick up a rifle for a while after that. They bought me a cheap bow and some arrows to shoot at a foam block in the garage. Was fun. Now my younger brother which is an adult sleeps with a shotgun under his bed and we have a 10 year old younger brother that runs around the house. We taught him about guns and he knows not to touch it. He has his nerf guns to run around and shoot his friends with in the neighborhood. I think it’s about how you are taught with guns and parents shouldn’t keep these things from you. My parents tried to keep me from things and it just made me want them more. My dad finally let me have a taste of beer and I decided I didn’t like it at 18 so I stayed away from it for a few more years. Knowledge is power. Don’t hold your kids back, keep them informed about what’s right and what’s wrong and teach them WHY they should and shouldn’t do something. Teach them why guns are dangerous and how to handle them so when they do finally pick up a gun they know not to swing it around like a moron and shoot their friends with it."

memes,fc7ixx0,t1_fc61giz,1577508881.0,The Bible Belt is still a thing. Bunch of moms listen to Facebook groups that say to raise your kid with Jesus and not let them go to public school which = Satan or something. My mom was like that sort of. She thought she was doing the best thing for me and maybe she was. Who knows. Both of my brothers and sister were homeschooled. I married a girl that was 100% homeschooled throughout life (also was in a weird church with cult like tendencies that got found out protecting child molestors but that’s a different story). If we have kids we will make sure they are in public school. I think we learned enough from our parents that churches and homeschooling is not the way. Religion is just a really old tool to control the populations.

memes,fc7hxjb,t1_fc5tgy3,1577507974.0,"It entirely depends on the private school. Mine didn’t require a dress code. Others nearby did. Teachers were kinda lax, more lax than some ppl at my old church. Everything is relative. There might also be kids that go through depression or some other struggle and might need to be homeschooled or thrown into private school for a month or a year and then thrown back into public school. Everyone is different. I just feel like I was held back because I was in private school and I was homeschooled. Social stuff has since then been more difficult for me and I sometimes feel awkward. I talk to other ppl that grew up similar to me and they say they feel the same. I think kids need adversity and need to get hurt to learn how shit is. We need a comfort blanket every now and then but that blanket isn’t always going to be there so we need those tough times where we’re getting our feelings hurt so we can improvise, adapt, and overcome bullshit."

Actually I went to private school too. We had a very good basketball team that usually beat the public schools. We also had a bunch of kids that got kicked out of public school.

This is a broken system and I’m glad it got abused to this extent because it’s all the more likely to get changed hopefully because of it.
