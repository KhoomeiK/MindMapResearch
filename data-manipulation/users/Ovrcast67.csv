Drinking a small amount will loosen you up just enough you might be able to have a therapeutic experience where you can accept your trauma around alcohol and move past it.

I'm really sorry you had to go through that with your parents and especially your mom. Most people don't get violent from alcohol though. You will just feel very open and relaxed and I usually get kind of a lovey-dovey feeling as well where I want to hug people and stuff. Idk, you aren't your mom, you're your own person, and I think it could be therapeutic for you, but there's no hurry. Maybe not on your birthday, just whenever you feel ready."
