AmItheAsshole,fevqio6,t1_fevk41g,1579400293.0,"Still a nursing fuckup then. When I delivered (3 different times) there was no ""assuming"". You get asked flat out who gets to be there and who doesn't. And those nurses are fiercely protective."
AmItheAsshole,fevq5lh,t1_fev23x5,1579400146.0,"That was the case in my hospital. I'm in the US. Nobody could come in unless *I* (actual laboring woman) allowed it. Mt husband couldn't ok it. He got a guest badge, but unless he left my side & got the guests, he wouldn't have been able to let anyone else in. It's not his call."
AmItheAsshole,fern08r,t1_feqe7pw,1579355978.0,"I've never in my life sat down to a game of cards without shuffling. How did OP not realize this was the clear and obvious solution? It seems like a little thing, but I'm leaning towards OP being the asshole for not teaching this to all his kids.

Also, do they only ever play just one game and that's it? Or does he leave with the deck for a mysteriously long time after every round? And nobody grew suspicious?"

nottheonion,feiemtz,t1_fei15t7,1579136728.0,"That sucks, that hasn't been my experience at all. I've been tons with my kids and I, because apparently we only get sick on Saturdays. Only had one instance of a problem/possible misdiagnosis on my kid, and even then my regular pedi said it was a pretty tough diagnosis since the symptoms looked like a lot of different things. I love our urgent care places."

*for anyone that's never heard it, that means we'd rat them out. 

Do it. They're hurting vulnerable kids that need someone going to bat for them. Do the right thing. The right thing is protecting children, no matter how it ends up for you. It is never right to protect an adult that is abusing children. Never."

Cooking,febx2sj,t1_fe8v15z,1578963717.0,"I did this once with chili but I had both containers out (I was cooking a couple things at once) and my husband got home.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdt32u1,t1_fdqyvhi,1578711280.0,"My best friend's brother died and I had to shop for an outfit. The experience of trying on clothes and being hassled by salespeople while I was shopping for funeral clothes was awful. Pretty sure I never wore those clothes again, either. I couldn't even look at them without being reminded of the loss. Having appropriate clothes ready to go probably would have made it easier."

femalefashionadvice,fdioikp,t1_fdidv5z,1578447498.0,"Man I finally found the perfect tiny crossbody and my whole life has improved. In my work sometimes I have to be places for 15+ hours in a day. My tiny crossbody bolds my phone, pens, and my most important papers, and I can wear it all day without feeling the weight. Backpacks would be too bulky and I'd be running into things all day trying to quickly dodge through crowds. 

That said, I have been seriously considering a nice backpack for regular work days just to be able to carry all my things in."
teaching,fdf64xo,t1_fddy4yp,1578354185.0,Yep. Knowing you have that parent to deal with again is what makes me have that look on my face. The kids are always great. They know the parent is crazy.

education,fcvnyd3,t1_fcvfps6,1578006197.0,"It's when there's a safety issue during the school day. A soft lockdown generally means lessons can continue, but there will be very little movement in the hallways. Outside doors are locked. A hard lockdown would be the lights out/hide/lock doors because there is something dangerous happening in the school. I've never been at a school that had this."

education,fcbod7y,t3_egv2db,1577589172.0,Done. I teach at a school with a huge population of students that speak very little English. Specific vocabulary lessons happen every day and I'm still not doing enough. It's so hard.
