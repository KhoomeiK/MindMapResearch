You dont think about it being icy and you might fall that first step, but if someone coming in or someone else says ""be careful"" you are more likely to take your time. And if you do fall and they say it's your fault when they didnt warn you there is an issue, but if you didnt honestly take any precautionary measures when  you were warned then it might be your fault. You were warned and knew the risk. You could have chosen to stay inside and avoid risk but you didnt. Or you could have chosen to walk slow and didnt


Additionally with this analogy is that you cant control the ice. As much as you presalt or prepare there will probably be ice out there and you have to be ready for it. The weather cant be changed but you can get tools and other things that will make it easier and safer to get through"

And were there not protests when Obama made office or Trump? A new power means change and people tend to hate change. We have our routines and like to stick to them. Addtionally, this governor has been in since August and the supplies were just discovered within the past couple weeks. Why would she not turn them over and announce what the previous administration did? Why would she not find some sort of mudslinging for future elections? Why would she not hold an investigation to find what happened and who was responsible?"

Firearms,ffey9vw,t1_ffepdn2,1579870212.0,There is actually some psychology into this too. People who tend to vote that way cant relate to facts as much but can relate to the emotions well. Because of this you want to use emotions to argue with them. While we have the ability to understand emotions it is not usually our primary fallback and we tend to use facts more. This causes some divide as we can understand them but they dont always understand us. So to really start to win a little more if you cant get through with facts try to use a little emotion
