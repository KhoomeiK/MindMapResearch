TrueOffMyChest,ff8ioke,t3_es5vqz,1579680268.0,Don’t beat yourself up OP. Most people either don’t notice or don’t care.
depression,fecyoww,t1_fecxmxj,1578990120.0,"I totally get that. Have you ever heard of the app calm harm? It’s an app to help distract from self harm and they have a lot of different activities to help cope. They also require a password to enter, just in case nosy friends or parents want to see what it is. Calm harm has helped me more than once and I always recommend to anyone who deals with self harm"
depression,fecyk14,t1_fecy0h4,1578989946.0,"Go whenever you can or whenever you’re up to it!! Even if it’s one day a week, that’s still a step in the right direction."

depression,fecy9hs,t3_eoh3q3,1578989560.0,"If you're worried about the initial conversation (which is completely understandable) maybe bring your sister as with you as support to have that discussion with your parents. If that still sounds scary, I would maybe suggest sending a text, email, or write a letter. By the way, super proud of you for wanting to actively seek help. That's literally the hardest part. You sound just like me when I was in high school. I would go straight to sleep the second I got home, eat dinner, and then fall back asleep. It sucks. Also if you feel confident and safe enough, maybe try explaining the struggles you've been going through to your friend. Maybe she can empathize and become a support system for you. I hope everything goes well, I'll be sending you good vibes. PM me if you ever need anything."
depression,fecxh8p,t3_eoh4h8,1578988575.0,I also managed to have a slip up and self harm this evening. I regret it now too. I don't really know what else to do. But just know that you're not alone.
depression,fecxed8,t3_eohg7n,1578988477.0,"I feel you. I had one of those down moments tonight. Holding out hope that when I wake up tomorrow everything will go back to normal. Life can really fucking suck sometimes but I wish you nothing but happiness OP, good luck."
depression,fecxaje,t3_eohihi,1578988349.0,Talked to internet strangers who wanted the best for me. I was shocked at how much a few strangers on reddit seemed to care about my well being. I'll never forget it.
depression,fecx60e,t3_eohjde,1578988198.0,"Maybe tell them what's up? They might already know that you seem to be down on yourself. If they are good friends, they'll want to help you and make you feel better when you hangout with them. Good luck."
depression,fecx1po,t3_eohndw,1578988056.0,"I used to be very over weight. I started going to the gym and ended up losing over 70 pounds. My self confidence has never been better. It's still not perfect, but it's nice to not completely hate myself. I'm not telling you that you need to lose weight or anything, but I think there's something about going to the gym and getting a work out in that also boosts confidence. You could probably also make a few friends when going. I always had to ask people how to use some of the equipment and most were friendly and wanted to help me."
depression,fecwmjv,t3_eohu6t,1578987553.0,"Stress can really fuck people up and I can imagine studying for O levels was extremely stressful for you. It's ok to not be happy when you're ""supposed to be happy."" Everyone deals with their own emotions differently. Don't beat yourself up."
depression,fecwh8d,t3_eoi2fp,1578987379.0,"So proud of you OP. I know we don't know each other but I'm happy you're alive. Best wishes going forward, friend."
depression,fecw5zw,t3_eoctkl,1578987015.0,"Ha, my dad did the exact same fucking shit. I told him that I was depressed and he replied with ""everyone gets depressed why does yours matter so much?"" That happened like 7 years ago but it still makes me cry when I think about it. Some people just don't understand mental illness."
depression,fecw199,t3_eofr27,1578986865.0,I care about you OP. Life can really fucking suck sometimes. Wishing you nothing but happiness.
depression,fecvtuy,t3_eoglgg,1578986631.0,"I do this too. I live in a suburb, so I try to find a quiet area or a dead end somewhere and just listen to music, collect my thoughts and take a deep breath. Surprisingly works pretty well, but only for a short period of time."
depression,fecvkm6,t1_fecs8qh,1578986340.0,"Losing weight was the hardest thing I have ever done, but also the most rewarding. If losing weight was easy, everyone would do it. I believe in you OP. I'm rooting for you."
depression,fecvart,t1_fecv2vd,1578986034.0,You're absolutely right. I think it's complete bullshit that I have to suffer from a mental illness meanwhile everyone else seem to be living happy lives. It would be nice to have just a moment of normalcy.
depression,fecv35y,t3_eogmnr,1578985792.0,"Yeah this can be a tough sub to read through. Can I suggest r/Eyebleach ? May not be life changing, but always gives me a half smile even when I'm in a deep state of depression. Good luck."
depression,fecuvnv,t3_eoguoy,1578985553.0,I just had a really rough night for absolutely no reason. You're not alone OP.
depression,fecutx2,t3_eogvbm,1578985498.0,"I feel the same way. Family members in my life like to ask what I'm going to do after college, and usually I give them some bullshit answer, but in reality I don't really see me being alive within the next 5 years. I'm honestly impressed that I made it this far. Good luck to you OP, I'll be thinking of you."
depression,fecua5k,t3_eoesye,1578984876.0,I had a rough night tonight too. You're not alone friend.
depression,fecu6hj,t3_eoh343,1578984764.0,"Hey OP. I also just recently hurt myself again after a couple months clean. Relapses happen unfortunately. Super random, but a coping skill I have found for myself are coloring books. The second I have the urge, I go over to my coloring book, pick a page and do the entire thing. By the end I usually have forgotten why I was so upset in the first place. I hope you can find happiness."
depression,fectwd2,t3_eohd92,1578984441.0,"Keep your head up OP, life fucking sucks sometimes. Wishing you luck."
depression,fecttoo,t3_eoe3rh,1578984359.0,"It will happen. I don't know when, but you will find someone who loves you. I'm not exactly in the same boat as you, but I am 21 year old virgin (almost 22) and it fucks with my head and my self esteem every day. I hate how much pressure is put on things like first kisses, first relationships, virginity, etc. I feel you OP, I hope you can find happiness."
depression,fect7vn,t3_eofe2r,1578983687.0,Wishing you happiness OP.
depression,fect4qk,t3_eogx53,1578983594.0,"I feel the same way. If there's one insecurity I have, it's that I'm 21 and still a virgin. I resent myself for it."
college,fecsvmz,t3_eods08,1578983320.0,Wishing you luck OP!!

trashy,fdeo5s2,t3_ekswn2,1578343129.0,I laughed
AmItheAsshole,fcnl7sh,t3_ei3eco,1577813668.0,"NTA. They did not “forget about you” OP, they are assholes who are using you for drinks. I had friends in high school who did shit like this to me all the time. Dropped every single one of them when I got to college and I now have friends who actually give a fuck about me. Please stop hanging out with these idiots in the new year."
ShaneDawson,fc7snhk,t3_egn7uo,1577517618.0,I don’t think so. Shane’s last two big scandals were because of jokes he made on his podcast. I would see Shane distancing himself as much as he can from a new podcast. It was my favorite content he ever put out though :(
depression,fbzcydx,t3_ef7m67,1577242571.0,"Not your fault at all OP. Sometimes miserable people feel the need to make everyone else around them miserable as well. Congrats with the new baby too, I’m sure you’ll be a great dad."
