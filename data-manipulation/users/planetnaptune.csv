namenerds,ffefqhv,t3_et13y2,1579846277.0,Female born in the 90s starts with a D. It got me spot on too!
JUSTNOMIL,ff96f1i,t3_es83fa,1579705938.0,Your mom is awesome. I strive to be like her!!
beyondthebump,ff8vt2j,t1_ff6zj2t,1579697774.0,"That is so cute. When my daughter was born she got a terrible diaper rash so the nurse said ""let's glaze the donut!"" So that's what we call it for all of them now. Lmao"
namenerds,fehw8fi,t3_ep32tl,1579125103.0,"I actually love the spelling the way you have it. I agree with you, each spelling to me seems like two completely different meanings or personalities. If I wasn't having a boy this time, I would seriously consider naming her May."
drugdetox,fedgucq,t1_fedgb45,1579011155.0,No problem. Good luck girl.
drugdetox,fedg9pc,t1_fedg7qy,1579010717.0,Also they might have some books there and prob a notebook too!
drugdetox,fedg7qy,t1_fedfxw3,1579010674.0,I wouldn't bc they will just take it. They might give you one while your there. If not at the detox then maybe at the treatment facility
drugdetox,fedfrpe,t3_eok1zl,1579010323.0,"I've been to a few detox facilities and I'm also pregnant just like you. I've been clean since 2015 so I have faith you can do this girl.

What to bring:
Toiletries- shampoo and conditioner, body wash, etc etc. I wouldn't bring makeup bc there's really no point. If alcohol is one of the first ingredients, try to find something without it or you'll be stuck with the cheap stuff they give you.

Comfy clothes- I can't stress that enough, especially being pregnant. Yoga or sweat pants, leggings. T-shirts, definitely being a comfy hoodie or two as well. Also slippers and socks and comfy slip on shoes. Some places dont allow shoe laces.

A journal to keep your thoughts in/place to vent. Don't bring pens, they will have them there. Also books if you like to read. It's very easy to get bored, and being bored just invites shitty thoughts in my opinion. 

I'll add anything else if I remember. Good luck girl. You got this."
coparenting,fe8qtm6,t3_enxyhv,1578929515.0,"As someone who grew up with parents as addicts, and as a recovering addict myself, please do what you can to help your daughter and get her away from her mother.

Is there anyway you could file an emergency custody hearing to get her fulltime? Would you keeping her full-time be something you can do? 

There's no telling what she (daughter) has seen or heard. I don't say that to scare you but it's the truth. People who are in active addiction will do unthinkable things, around children or not. You need to do what you can to get your daughter out of there. Maybe it will be a wake-up call for your ex. But your daughter does not need to be around that."
breakingmom,fe2wi5w,t3_eni8y5,1578843657.0,I read your other post when you originally posted it and have thought about it a couple times. I'm so glad you went to see her. I'm sure she feels so good right now. You did everything right IMO. Good for you Mama!!
Methadone,fdtw8v5,t1_fdrq9c2,1578723228.0,Yes I understand! I've been on it for a few years but this is my third clinic. I have 5 takehomes so I only go Monday and pick them up Tuesday. I would be super pissed if I had to start over!
Methadone,fdoc22p,t3_emdjdm,1578602458.0,"When I moved to a different state, everything switched over. I got the same amount of takehomes, but every clinic is different. So (hopefully) you won't have to start over!"
MedicalGore,fdnmyvf,t1_fdmvy72,1578589155.0,Oh wow. I'm currently 21 weeks along. I'm glad she's doing better now! I can't imagine..
namenerds,fdgdssk,t3_el5cs8,1578392011.0,"Elmina is really pretty. I like Emera too, my daughter's name is Emery so not far off!"
AskReddit,fdgd2dd,t1_fdg2w77,1578390933.0,I hope you're in a better situation now!
AskMen,fd9h6pd,t3_ek99we,1578233298.0,"We were both in bed, I was sound asleep and I woke myself up with a really loud fart. 

I was laying there, hoping to God he wasn't awake, so I start turning my head as slowly and quietly as I can and he's wide awake looking at me. 

He was like ""yeah, I heard that. It sounded like a machine gun"" 

Then we busted out laughing. Which made me fart more. Which made us laugh even harder."
Adoption,fd4juel,t3_eerllj,1578168189.0,How did it go? Did he love them?!
breakingmom,fcxfrg0,t1_fcuitfd,1578061775.0,Yeah that seems to be the better choice. I think my depression will get better alot when I leave here as well because he's the main reason I feel so low.
breakingmom,fcxfpbn,t1_fcuaf4o,1578061731.0,"There's only one DV shelter where I live but there's a regular homeless shelter as well but there's a waiting list for that one. I would prefer the DV one, even with its flaws, just bc it's all women and they specialize in this type of situation. Thank you and thanks for your reply!"
breakingmom,fcxfi72,t1_fcuaf8r,1578061579.0,I've been to the DV shelter here before so they know me and my situation very well and it's only getting worse. I think my depression will get better significantly when I leave here too. Thanks for your reply!
breakingmom,fcxfe7t,t1_fcuck7f,1578061496.0,Thank you for this. I appreciate it!
Vent,fcvh6dp,t3_ej17i1,1578002005.0,Let that shit out!
scarystories,fcp6pso,t1_fcp0vuk,1577852288.0,Holy shit. I would've had a heart attack I swear to God.
Parenting,fcof79o,t3_ei6ug6,1577830775.0,"I relate to this so much. My 3 year old daughter will bat her eyes, put her hands together (like she's praying) and say ""please mommy?"" in the sweetest voice. She knows I'll cave and that I'm a pushover and she uses it to her advantage. I gotta start sticking to my guns bc I have a 1 year old son and 1 on the way, I can't have all of them treating me like a doormat.

Good for you Mama! Keep it up!

(Also sorry for writing a novel on your post)"
AmItheAsshole,fcn99ly,t3_ehw713,1577806543.0,"NTA by any means. I say that to my kids and when me and their father were together so did he and I was not offended by it at all. I loved that he loves our children so much and your wife should feel the same way. 

Maybe therapy might do her some good? I don't feel like that's normal for her to get so upset about. Imagine how it made your daughter feel if she knew why her mom was so upset. It's not a competition on who loves who more."
breakingmom,fck9nyd,t3_ehn8aj,1577720306.0,Hopefully you can find another one for cheap again! A dog is much better than a purse and I know the babes will be so happy!! Good for you Mama!
pregnant,fcamovp,t3_egs47a,1577572295.0,This sounds so good. Now I'm not going to stop thinking about it until I eat some!
offmychest,fc91ej1,t1_fc7lblj,1577545460.0,Thank you for this!!
offmychest,fc7iv1k,t1_fc6exg6,1577508809.0,"I'm in Southeastern NC. They have a DV shelter here that I actually went to May of last year, but it wasn't a good enviorment for my daughter and I. (I was pregnant with my son and now am pregnant again.) They had bedbugs, people constantly stealing other people's things, and some of the advocates working were so rude. I need to get out of here, I just have no idea how to honestly.

Wasn't trying to post a sob sorry on your post, but it does feel good to get it out sometimes."
offmychest,fc6cnu4,t3_egcwee,1577477455.0,"I'm in this siutation myself currently. It's a feeling like no other. Constantly walking on eggshells, scared to say the 'wrong' thing, getting cussed at and called names, etc etc. But for some women, like myself, it's really hard to leave. I have no other place to go, no family or money or anything, and he uses that to his advantage. One day I will make it out. I have to.

I hope the woman you heard is better today. I will be thinking about her"
LuLaNo,fbxr4i4,t1_fbx0ft9,1577198187.0,I feel the same way about some of the ones I've seen too. To each their own! Who cares what I (or anyone else) thinks as long as you like it!
