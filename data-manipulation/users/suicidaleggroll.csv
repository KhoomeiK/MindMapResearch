gadgets,ffo6zcr,t1_ffnr4ep,1580074773.0,"Again, not a high bar.  Why are you so focused on the piddly little circuitry built into these portable devices?  They're all bad.  Yes, some are better than others, but none are very good.  You're also completely ignoring the amp itself, all of which are absolutely terrible in every device you've mentioned so far.

There are three critical parts of a headphone setup.  The DAC, which converts the digital stream to an analog waveform, the amp, which amplifies that waveform so that it can actually drive a dynamic load like a speaker, and the headphones themselves.  All three are important.  Focusing all of your effort on just a single one is an exercise in futility.  Buying the best DAC in the world won't do jack if you have a terrible amp following it and some cheap cans.  Similarly, the best amp can't do much if it's being fed by a distortion-riddled signal from a cheap DAC and feeding it to some cheap cans.  AND, last but not least, the best headphones in the world are useless if you can't drive them properly.  Cell phones, iPods, etc. are all pretty much shit when it comes to the DAC and amp in them.  Feeding any headphone that costs more than $50 off of them is a waste.

Edit: Look, I used to be in the same boat.  I refused to upgrade my phone for years because I didn't want to lose the headphone jack.  I hadn't used it to directly power headphones for a very long time (because, as I mentioned above, the amps built into phones are shit), but I did use it to feed the input of an external headphone amp regularly.  Finally I bit the bullet and bought an external DAC.  The sound quality is significantly better, and not only that, but I now have the flexibility to use any phone I want without having to worry about whether or not it has a headphone jack.  Yes it's an extra expense, but it's worth it if you care about how your music sounds, even if your phone already has a headphone jack.  And once you have one, you don't need the headphone jack anymore, opening up the door to whatever phone or other music source you like."

Let me draw out a scenario.  User uses a compromised ATM.  They swipe their card, the attacker gets the number.  The user gets an SMS with a special code, enters the code, withdraws their money, and move on with their lives.  Five months later, the attacker has loaded the card info on a reprogrammable card of their own and tries to buy $300 in prepaid Visa cards at Walmart.  The system prompts them for the 2FA code, they don’t know it, so they cancel and use somebody else’s card info they grabbed on another day from another atm.

tifu,fcvg0pv,t1_fctminm,1578001317.0,"Evolution is really very simple, it's just based on 3 observable facts:

1) There is randomness in our DNA.  Some people are tall, some are short, some have blue eyes, some brown, some dogs have white coats, some have dark coats, some cats have long hair, some have short hair.

2) These traits are often genetic, so someone who possesses this trait is more likely to pass it to their offspring than someone who doesn't.  It's not guaranteed of course, we're just talking about probabilities here.  Tall parents are more likely to have taller offspring, red-haired parents are more likely to have red-haired offspring, etc.

3) Sometimes these traits give the individual an advantage in nature.  Taller people can pick fruits from taller trees.  Faster people have an easier time outrunning predators.  Cats with larger paws don't sink into the snow as much, so it's easier to catch prey and avoid predators.  These advantages often lead to individuals surviving longer.  This means that they're more likely to reach child-bearing age, and once they do start procreating, they can survive longer in adult-hood, resulting in (on-average) more offspring than other individuals.

That's it, that's all there is.  Take these 3 rules, extrapolate over millions of years, and you get evolution.  There's really no arguing it, it happens, we can see it every day.  It happens in our pets (though instead of nature deciding what traits get to continue on vs die off, it's the breeders), it happens in humans (people today are on-average 15 cm taller than they were 200 years ago), it happens in wildlife, etc.

Some people say they believe in ""micro"" evolution (eg: humans getting taller over time) but not ""macro"" evolution (eg: primates transforming into humans (or some common ancestor splitting and transforming into both modern primates and humans)), but that's nonsense.  The only difference between ""micro"" and ""macro"" evolution is the timescale over which you look.  A few thousand years will only give you small changes, but you add up a few thousand of those small changes and now you end up with an individual that looks vastly different than their ancestors did a few million years ago.  It's also region-specific, a trait that gives an individual an advantage in one climate (eg: thicker fur in a cold climate), may be a hindrance in another, so the species ends up splitting and you get snow leopards in the mountains and regular leopards in the jungle."
