I don't know how you are even trying to debate this, other than you're a bit of a nationalist who is glorifying the old USSR and Joseph Stalin.

Berlin was split in half with the Soviets holding the entire eastern HALF of the city while the UK, France, and US held the west. This wasn't about ""the spoils"", like they were looting the city as repayment or something, it was about control of Germany and an opportunity for Stalin to take over eastern Europe. Did you see the UK, France, and US all holding their zones in west Berlin like the Soviets held the entire eastern half? Did the UK, France, and US build a freaking wall between them as well? People in East Berlin and east Germany were living under Soviet rule, and Stalin never intended to give eastern Europe back let alone eastern Berlin back to the Germans.

You are literally debating the start of the Cold War, which is entirely built upon mistrust between the Soviets and the West.

Edit: Also if you know about the Yalta conference, you should know how much mistrust there was going into that and coming out of it."

There were tesions already between the west and the Russians which is pretty well documented. Roosevelt and Churchill both were weary of Stalin and the Yalta conference was basically them giving in to Stalin's demands (including the Soviets basically occupying all of eastern Europe) in order to prevent Stalin from taking all of Germany and possibly encroaching further into western Europe. Stalin then did the 1948 blockade in a power move to sieze control of West Berlin, which led to the Berlin airlift and the Cold War was on. If you're into it Dan Carlin has some great podcasts that cover the tensions between Stalin and the West at the end of WW2 and how it led into the cold War/nuclear arms race.

It's a tough deal as a fan too, because on one hand I'd want to see them make one more run with Frankie before they let him walk, but if that's an inevtibility then the smart play is to trade him. My issue with that is we invested all these years into building this kid into a Superstar, and before he even reaches his peak age range we have to say goodbye. So what does that mean for let's say Gavin Lux, if the Dodgers deal ends up happening. How is it any different if/when he would reach his peak? Frankie is the face of the franchise and beloved across baseball. He's one of the few players you can argue has real fan draw appeal.

MLB is shifting their policy on marijuana btw following the opioid death of Tyler Skaggs, so should the NFL.

I just completely disagree with shutting him down and Ed expecting that to help get a deal done. they need to not only play him but run the offense through him, let him put up good numbers, and increase interest. He was playing pretty poorly before his outbursts, he needs to show up over the next couple weeks. He's not an unknown and that's not what I was saying. But he needs to show he's not on a steep decline...and tonight they are feeding him and he's producing, which is a good start.

By the way running the offense through Love doesn't hinder the young players. The offense should have been running through him to begin with. Sexton ball hogging doesn't make him better, no matter of Love is here or not. This team needs to do a better job of moving the ball and distributing. Our guards are at the very bottom of the league in assists right now. That's isn't Kevin Love's fault."
clevelandcavs,fdi25s2,t1_fdht3g9,1578434391.0,"If that were the case, that teams have already seen Love at his best, he'd already be gone. It's been no secret that he wants to be traded (he said he'd prefer going to Portland) and the Cavs have been trying for a month+ now. Sitting him may keep him healthy, but it also does nothing to showcase his ability. If he wants to be traded he needs to start going off, and the team needs to alter the rotation so he's not on the court with Sexton so much. Run the offense through Love for a month and being Sexton off the bench, stagger their minutes as much as possible. We'll still need to eat a huge portion of his salary but any contender needs to see Love rejuvenated to make a deal. Otherwise it looks like you're getting a headcase who is depressed and acting out. An apology doesn't erase all that, playing well will."

If the first stat didn't catch your attention, the second should have. The one thing we had working this year was Chubb, then eventually Chubb and Hunt. Play action boots would have been called more often if we had pretty much any other coaching staff, even if you want to discount the success rate.

It isn't like everything else was also working and therefore this is a meaningless stat.
