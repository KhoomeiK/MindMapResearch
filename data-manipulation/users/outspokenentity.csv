politics,ffacrg2,t3_esifcd,1579732484.0,It's really sucky how this information gets so little notice by most people. No one really seems to care.

books,ff9lu27,t3_es26sk,1579715707.0,"It is a great series. I found the second book a bit silly on the sex part, especialyl when he finds the sex fairy and she teaches him how to be a man, it was pretty ridiculous, but ok, fine."

relationship_advice,ff97s7y,t1_ff86620,1579706827.0,"Well, for one, I'm not a man, for two, there's nothing wrong with porn, and for three, surprise!!! The internet is full of porn."
relationship_advice,ff81xsu,t1_ff7xlmm,1579663855.0,"As a purveyor of adult content, sometimes it'll just pop up in a subreddit or something or maybe someone posts an NSFW in one of my discord messages or something."

relationship_advice,ff7dxj8,t3_erzhdn,1579647321.0,"I wouldn't say anything, it's probably just porn or something. You'll just start a big fight over it."
relationship_advice,ff7dfvz,t1_ff7c5ff,1579646996.0,"That's kinda what I thought too. Not really worth making a big deal out of the name part, but why he felt the need to lie about the reasoning is kinda odd. Seems really dumb."
relationship_advice,ff7d94r,t3_erxa9n,1579646870.0,"Huh that's odd. There's always the chance he really does just happen to like his ex's name and that's why he chose to change his name to hers even though they didn't end up together. If you're uncomfortable with it, change your name! I probably wouldn't suggest trashing your whole marriage over it though. A lot of couples have different last names now."

phoenix,fep3itz,t1_feos7iq,1579311322.0,Ok... so fuck the doctor who didn't notice she was pregnant. Her personal doctor is probably not the guy that manages the place. You're just spreading blame around where it isn't due.
phoenix,feorfbh,t1_feoqvpa,1579304407.0,Underfunded care homes are not a symptom of bad management; they are a symptom of our broken healthcare system.
science,feoqzps,t3_eq3eo7,1579304283.0,"Is this why people are so stupid these days, and shit like populism is spreading across the globe?"
phoenix,feooi5t,t1_feobo19,1579303075.0,"I disagree. If an employee of a business commits a crime, it is not the responsibility of the management or the business owner that the employee committed a crime. You can run your business well, you can manage your business well, but if an employee commits a crime it's still on the employee. The only way management or the business entity should or could be held responsible is if they knew about the behavior and looked the other way. I admit I don't know all the details of the case, but I have not heard anyone say management was involved in any way, shape or form."
news,feo01pb,t3_eq1u06,1579293275.0,I hope the family sues and gets paid.
phoenix,fenxkfr,t3_eq19ii,1579292299.0,"Not defending the events, but why would there need to be a change in management? The management didn't rape the victim from what I understand. You can't hold everyone in the entire vicinity responsible for something one person did. I know people like to spread the blame around as wide as possible whenever anything bad happens, but you can't hold everyone else responsible for one thing an unrelated person did."
politics,fenpksm,t1_fenkabt,1579288980.0,"Its 2 real people, diamond and silk are their internet personalities. They are simply terrible people, simply put; if you're black and experience racism it's not really happening it's just your own insecurities and lack of know-how holding you back aka. personal responsibility aka. all you gotta do is pull yourself up by your bootstraps!!"
nottheonion,fenk3g0,t3_eq2q8i,1579286393.0,Damn I feel bad for his wife. She has that guy as her husband. Not a great way to start a marriage.

politics,fenerfr,t3_eq0ftc,1579283120.0,Now why would Trumpers be afraid of being investigated?? I wonder what they could be doing behind the scenes to make them so fearful. HMMMMMM.
politics,femz6sm,t1_femqcef,1579273333.0,Diamond and Silk are two of the most ignorant disgusting human beings I have ever seen on TV.
arizonapolitics,femygql,t1_felo12r,1579272841.0,"It was basically stolen because McCain was MIA for the last two terms due to his illness. He ran for re-election in 2016 and should not have because he announced his illness and died promptly afterwards. He basically his that knowledge from the public until after the election, knowing it would secure the seat for a Republican for another term. If he had made it public he was ill, he probably would not have been re-elected, and in all honesty he should have let the public know he was ill before running again. What a shady move that was!"
arizonapolitics,femy42z,t1_felbrb8,1579272598.0,NOBODY should hold a senate seat for 3/4ths of their lives. That's fucking ridiculous. McCain was negligent as a senator for most of his last decade in that seat. He was worthless and only there to vote when he needed to.
politics,feknqcg,t1_fekjqyp,1579203865.0,"> nfluence to destroy the party so that a new party can be built that is free of the corrupting influence of all this money

I think that's pretty far-fetched. I mean, that's basically the GOP's pipe dream right there; let the dnc eat itself alive while they reign supreme. not a smart move."
politics,fekija2,t1_fekg85g,1579200767.0,That's a good point
