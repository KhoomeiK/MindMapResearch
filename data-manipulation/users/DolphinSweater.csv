I remember nothing about the comedy other than it got 0 laughs. I DO remember meeting him and paying like 10 bucks for a signed headshot which we hung in our college living room and made a sort of shrine to. My friend asked him if he's just here to bang college girls, and he pointed to some lady and just said, ""Well, that's my wife, so no"". It was awkward, then we left."

They're not short videos, but they cover topics like how to fully renovate a bathroom, and how to build a deck, how to lay laminate flooring. It's like the opposite of ""The rest of the fucking owl"" shit. He goes through every step, and explains what he's doing and why he's doing it and how you can do it yourself. And there's no filler garbage. He's got an hour long video on how to paint your kitchen cabinets, and it's all good info. I watched a 2.5 hour video of him installing a shower, and now I'm thinking, hey, my shower could actually use a redo, I think I could pull that off."

unpopularopinion,feoh4tr,t3_eq2knz,1579300014.0,"Back in college there were a group of homless guys that lived behind the parking lot where I left my car, I'd see them almost every day. They'd say things like ""Hey man, I'm watching your car for you."" Yada yada yada, I'd give them a few bucks here and there, whatever. But there was a liquor store right across the street too. So every once and awhile I'd toss them a few beers from the case I just bought. That graduated to me asking them what they actually wanted and grabbing that for them every once in awhile, to occasionally, I'd sit with them and have a few beers together. They were all actually very nice guys. All Vietnam vets, one had a prostetic arm. I like to think we were on friendly terms, but I know they were probably just humoring a dumb kid willing to buy them beer. But it was interesting at least. When I told them I was graduating and leaving town, they all gave me a hug and said they'd miss me. But yeah, I didn't mind actaully buying the beer for them, it was a few bucks out of my budget here and there, I've never missed it. If it made their day any better, it was worth it to me."

I had slowed to a stop at this point and was just watching. 

It somehow went through all oncoming traffic and to the other side. Which was a new car dealership and slammed into a brand new truck.

Whatcouldgowrong,fcpgp9e,t1_fcp0ted,1577863240.0,"I'm raised Catholic (now atheist), and I lived in Germany for 5 years. I think what a lot of Europeans see in the US is the Evangelicals. Catholics in America don't make a lot of noise on anything other than abortion. From my experience, being catholic in America is like being Jewish in America, it's more of a culture. There are a lot of Catholics that don't go to church and fuck and party and whatnot, but if you ask them, sure, they're Catholic. It's something you're born as. Whereas in Europe, because most people aren't religious, if you're Catholic, that means you're CATHOLIC. 

Also there are comparatively few Catholics in the US compared to other Christians."
Whatcouldgowrong,fcpg9dy,t1_fcoxh6x,1577862655.0,"I think you have Catholics confused with Evangelicals. Catholics never preach that non-catholics will ""burn in hell"" simply for being non-catholic. You have to commit a mortal sin, to go to hell in Catholicism. There are a lot of rules about that sort of thing. And they're not really anti-gay either. I mean, they're not like for it specifically, but they're not really against it. I've never been to a Catholic mass where they even mentioned it.

It's also walking distance to Forest Park which is awesome, as well as the Loop which is a pretty student-oriented street full of restaurants and entertainment. You'll pay the ""student tax"" for living there though. The Central West End is on the other end of Forest Park from Wash U, and it's more upscale ""city living"", this is where a lot of young professionals live. There are a ton of other cool neighborhoods as well if you're willing to go a bit further from campus. Soulard is funky, it's our old ""French Quarter"", South Grand, and Cherokee Street are a bit more hipster. A bit more dangerous though, especially Cherokee. Tower Grove is a good neighborhood, and it's near Tower Grove Park, which is a great park. Shaw is nice too, a bit more ""residential"". There's also ""The Grove"" which has a lot of cool bars and restaurants, it's a pretty LGBT friendly area if that's important to you. Dogtown is cool, it's a bit nearer than the others, just south of Forest Park. I would suggest any of those neighborhoods. But my top ones for you would be Debaliviere, The Grove, and Shaw.

We don't have river access in the city, and you should absolutely not swim in the Mississippi! What we do have is easy access to the Ozarks. There are tons of small rivers, like the Meramac within an hours drive that you can swim, float, and camp on. 

While you're here, go to the Zoo in forest park, it's free. Go to the City Museum downtown (google it), check out our many wonderful breweries if that's your thing. There's a ton of info out there already on stuff to do in St. Louis, and a lot of it's free."
