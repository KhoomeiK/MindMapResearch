TrueOffMyChest,ff4l0y0,t1_ff4kkz3,1579566177.0,"The older ones have part time jobs. They have to buy their own clothes if they want new (ages 16-18). I get they can pay for some stuff but they have to buy all their personal needs stuff too. Shampoo, deodorant, etc. The one that has seizures has to pay his own medicine co-pays so he has his medicine. I could go on and on. And oh- the mom homeschools all the kids because public schools will teach them things, socially, they shouldn’t be learning. Can you imagine trying to teach 11 kids all in one day? The variances in age alone seems like you couldn’t cover everything."
TrueOffMyChest,ff4ko9v,t1_ff4kd1a,1579565934.0,Chop it off. Loranna Bobbit style.
TrueOffMyChest,ff4kjg7,t1_ff4gp7l,1579565840.0,The eldest daughter met someone from a visiting church who lived in another state. They had a long distance courtship and engagement. She married him and got the hell out of her dads house. She doesn’t want kids because she had to take care of her siblings most of her life (19 yrs old at time of marriage).  The other older girls don’t want kids either.
TrueOffMyChest,ff4kd22,t1_ff4ezts,1579565715.0,"No. That’s preventing birth. They do not believe in that. My issue is, with both husband and wife having health problems, who is going to take care of these kids if they die. The wife had serious complications with a birth. Got knocked up twice after. She doesn’t want more kids but won’t go against her husband and his beliefs. I asked her, “ doesn’t he care about your health?”  His response was if it’s Gods plan for her to leave this Earth, than so be it. ????? Idiot. It would serve him right to be left with all those kids. I told her she should tell the dr to tie her tubes when he’s in there, with the last birth. She wouldn’t do it. I told her that the dr can’t discuss her medical stuff with her husband if she doesn’t want to share it. She still wouldn’t do it."
TrueOffMyChest,ff4jumv,t1_ff4ih5f,1579565358.0,Right on.
TrueOffMyChest,ff49gvh,t3_erk74k,1579558453.0,"There is a minister at my local church who has 11 kids. He doesn’t believe in birth control because it’s Gods will if he is to have more children. His wife was told not to have anymore children 2 kids ago, he has had a heart attack and has severe medical issues. He barely works. She barely works. They make the older kids take care of the younger ones. All the kids are dressed poorly (oversized shoes or coats that don’t button). They survive off donations from other people. They are constantly using the church van because theirs breaks down all the time and now the church van is on its last leg. The church has a very small congregation, and he’s always asking for help from them to pay their electric bill. One child needs seizure medicine and he was going without it because they couldn’t afford the co-pay. Another broke his glasses. They couldn’t afford that either and his eyes were starting to cross so an additional collection plate was passed around for that. The list goes on and on. I agree with you 100%. Quit having children you can’t afford then impose on other people. What are we supposed to say, “sorry you can’t eat today”."
TrueOffMyChest,ff47cs6,t1_ff449bu,1579557139.0,"I think she feels she needs a change. Which she probably does. She is very concerned for her daughter and being with her will make her feel better. I think I’m being selfish. 

She knows she can come back. She has options here. I just don’t think she will leave if her daughter doesn’t. You are right tho, she need to make her own choices."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff438fo,t1_ff42768,1579554569.0,Who will watch the baby when she wants to go out and party?
UnsentLetters,ff3vspz,t1_ff3unw6,1579549938.0,That’s very magnanimous of you. Of course the heart wants what the heart wants. Unfortunately your head and heart aren’t always on the same page. Wanting someone else’s happiness at the expense of your is very selfless. It’s a normal reaction to go after what you want but not at some else’s expense. You never know what the future holds but definitely move forward with your life. You never know what the future holds for you.
UnsentLetters,ff3qvun,t3_erglyd,1579546903.0,"Please don’t take this the wrong way. This letter sounds exactly like a letter my daughters ex would have wrote. He has verbally said basically everything you did. My daughter was hurt beyond repair. She put him first for 7 years. For the last 1 1/2 yrs, he was “figuring himself out” while dating other girls, but telling my daughter that she was his future. He needed this time. Bullshit. He wanted her waiting while he sowed his wild oats. I’m not saying you did these things but if you truly love this person, and she gave you multiple chances, and you still screwed up, let her go. If she has moved on and is now happy, don’t disrupt her happiness. If she gave you many chances, and you ignored them, and she has now moved on, it is selfish to ask her to give all that up for yet another chance. Learn from your mistakes, be better for the next person in your life, but leave her alone. I’m sorry if this seems rude or unfeeling but I watched the devastation from the other end, and it is gut wrenching and horrible. I hope you feel better and happiness finds you once again."
toastme,ff3itq4,t1_ff2xemv,1579541958.0,Yes. So perfectly said.
toastme,ff3is5p,t3_erd9ey,1579541931.0,"Listen....boys come and go. No one wants to hear this when they are going thru it but you WILL meet someone better for you. As far as the job, when one door closes, God opens a window. It could be for the best. It may make you look for something better for you. That’s a lot of stuff to happen all at one time but you can do this !!!!  Hopefully you have a good support system. Lean on them in times of need. Life is giving you a kick in the bit right now and it means good things are out there awaiting you."
TrueOffMyChest,ff3d13a,t1_ff38bsu,1579538693.0,"Yeah. Cuz pussy is the most Important thing. Go tell a priest that. I feel so sorry for anyone that had to grow up in your household.

The word “retard” is used as an insult. As being a moron or imbecile. The correct phrase is developmentally disabled. Mental retardation is a clinical term. The use of retard was medically used years ago to lump a bunch of people that had all sorts of problems. Now, they have correct terms as someone that has cognitive problems, ADHD, ADD, etc.  Learn it. Use it."
UnsentLetters,ff31tx1,t3_erdhbl,1579531453.0,I’m sure they feel the same for you. This was such a poignant post. Good friends are hard to come by. I’m sure their new spouse will become your friend too.

As far as the makeup, she’s on tv and has her picture taken a lot. I’m sure when the cameras aren’t at her house, she isn’t in full makeup. I don’t understand why everyone hates on her. She’s a mom of three, seems to be doing a good job, is married and has a nice supportive husband who loves her and treats her oldest daughter like his own, thank God because real dad sucks. She’s trying to promote her businesses, like many people do on social media platforms. If you don’t like it, scroll on by. Here’s a TM doing well and still people got to bash on her. I’m ready for the downvotes. I don’t care."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff2x946,t3_er1bws,1579527522.0,Classic Jenelle. Thank God for Barb. The o my issue I have is all the screaming and dysfunction in front of Jace. Barb should have emancipated Jenelle and kicked her out. Jenelles selfishness stands out here so vividly.

TrueOffMyChest,ff2wjqh,t1_ff2w3bf,1579526832.0,"You are messed up man. Handicapped people probably form the most attachments to people. Just because they can’t verbalize doesn’t mean there is no attachments. As far as being able to have sex? What the hell does that mean?? You have to decide Life is life or you can choose. No gray areas buddy

Edit: please stop using the word retarded. That’s not appropriate in this day and age."

YoungAndPregnant,ff2w49i,t1_ff2nlsw,1579526399.0,"I know. The mom is probably terrified that her ignorant daughters will leave with her innocent grandchildren and she will have no control over what happens to them. Steph is by no means the answer to this situation but I think she has admitted to her own mistakes and is trying. The way these girls talk about getting high, partying and getting drunk and Rachel admitted to sleeping with “possible baby daddy” just to get her boyfriend jealous,  all this in front of Steph, her mom. Steph just sat their and listened while eating French fries while they were out to eat, like she was one of her girlfriends. The fuck if I would ever admit all that stuff (I wouldn’t do it anyway) in front of my mother. This girl is 17. Wtf. Where is CPS?"
TrueOffMyChest,ff2vl44,t3_er5d2z,1579525844.0,"Sorry but your friends and family sound jealous that you are looking better. They should be more supportive. And it isn’t just about the looks. You said you are felling better and in less pain. That alone should be reason enough to hype you up. Every time someone says something snarky, just grin and bear it because deep down, they were wishing it were them."
YoungAndPregnant,ff2vcrm,t3_er8fkj,1579525603.0,"Most teens are not ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood. This does not surprise me at all. It’s such a touchy situation but I am a believer if you are a parent, and you believe your teen is sexually actively, get them on birth control immediately. I’ll probably get downvoted because people may think you are giving permission or your blessing if you do this but kids are going to have sex anyway."
UnsentLetters,ff2uybr,t3_er7s70,1579525173.0,"Your feelings are total valid. Not only are you feeling empathetic toward the young woman and her family that were effected in this horrific crime, it happened close to where you live. Your home is supposed to be your sanctuary and if you are feeling unsafe now, that’s totally understandable. Maybe taking self defense classes or another way to make you feel in charge of your self will make you feel better."
TrueOffMyChest,ff2uhmz,t1_ff1b3yl,1579524655.0,"Ok. I get it now. Abortion is ok if it’s going to cost us taxpayers too much money to care for a child if they someday end up in a facility or if they keep having health problems because, hey, they are just retarded anyway (your words not mine). You are one messed up individual. You can’t say abortion is ok for these reasons (rape, major health issues) or abortion is wrong. Who decides how severely handicapped you have to be to be able to abort. Sometimes the severity of a defect isn’t known until after the child is born. Then what? What if the child is really bad? Do you kill it then?"
TrueOffMyChest,ff2u780,t3_eqzv8h,1579524330.0,Forget. It’s like talking to a wall. Anti-abortion people have their stance on pro-life and you will never get through to them. I gave up the above idiot too.

TrueOffMyChest,ff0pq36,t1_ff0pd2u,1579471127.0,So it’s ok with you to abort a child if they have a birth defect?  I love how you can separate your feelings.
TrueOffMyChest,ff0o7iw,t1_ff0m0n8,1579470706.0,"Wrong. Very wrong. Being a woman, who has given birth, I know the joys and struggles of having children. It is my greatest joy. I chose to get pregnant. But if I had gotten pregnant in a time in my life when I wasn’t ready, well I can’t say what I would do. She could also regret deciding to have it. It’s HER choice. 

How would you feel about abortion if she were raped? Would it be ok then or should she still have it? What if she got pregnant, but her life could be compromised because of the birth, should she have to have the child?"

TrueOffMyChest,fesvwvt,t1_fep2t56,1579369568.0,I think you just have to give yourself some time. Trust is hard to give when you’ve been abused. Try not to  distrust others because of what you’ve been through. It’s hard because your guard can be up but also have to realize that trust should be given freely until someone doesn’t deserve it. You’ll be ok.

I have (2) 23 yr old kids at home and a husband. 1- in school still, the other child recently started their career job. I always do for everyone in my family before myself. It’s a mom thing I guess. Very recently started saying no more often to friends and family. I’m always the one people can rely on and go to. Putting yourself last all the time makes you disconnect from your feelings because you are always worried and thinking of your loved ones before yourself. I’m getting better about things and starting to put my needs higher on my priority list. Do things that make you happy. Do things for you. Make yourself a priority."

She had her opportunity and it was obvious she made a good first impression but then started to appear to be rude when she kept interrupting. However I don’t think she used someone else’a champagne on purpose. I believe that was an accident. She attempted to explain and apologize. I think she was trying to be sincere. I’m not fooled by the country pumpkin attitude tho. She knows what she’s doing.

However, if he doesn’t receive the job, it could be a blessing in disguise. More responsibility does equal more pay BUT also means more stress with the additional responsibility. If your dad is 60 yrs old, he may be able to retire soon. If he is financially secure and prepared himself for retirement, it may not be in his best interest. Either way, it will be fine. It may be best not to mention that you saw his application. If he is as stoic as you say, he may not want to bow embarrassed if things don’t work out."

It will only help her make better choices. I promise."

BachelorNation,fe2isfs,t3_eng3qk,1578838816.0,"All I know is she needs to stay off Peters season. She’s probably appearing because of the franchise deems she does but she had her chance. She chose Jed and had a date with Tyler after things didn’t work out with Jed. Let Peter have his opportunity, just like Hannah had. If he comes off his season and things don’t work out, then maybe if they can try dating. He appearing and crying and such isn’t fair."
UnsentLetters,fe2hzwq,t1_fe00zu4,1578838519.0,"If it’s someone you want to spend your life with, let them help/share your burdens. Life is like a roller coaster, his and lows, dips and turns. Such as life. If this person is who you think they are, they can help and be of comfort. You would be able to see if this person can withstand the struggles of real life."
toastme,fe2gue3,t1_fe2f5s0,1578838204.0,"Probably because he knows you are nice and wonderful. I know this sounds backward but it seems like he didn’t want to hurt you or make you feel inadequate in actuality, that is what he did because you found out he was seeking other people to date. If you are a good girl, Heed my words, he will be back. Think wisely."
toastme,fe2f1z6,t1_fe1hju3,1578837693.0,He didnt want to say the real reason was he wanted to date other people. It wasn’t honest but he didn’t cheat on her. He probably thought it was better than saying he’s not interested. People break up. It happens. Life goes on.
toastme,fe2efze,t3_enh0nt,1578837462.0,"It was probably an excuse and he thought it wouldn’t hurt as much if he told you the real reason which seems to be he wants to date other people. I bet he will be want you back after he realizes how great you are and that what’s “out there” isn’t better. My daughter went through something similar. Dated someone for 5 1/2 yrs and another 1 1/2 yrs he was back and forth while he was “fixing himself” (IE: dating around). She finally put a stop to it, met someone else and old boyfriend said he loved only her and wanted her back. It’s been a year and a half and he’s still trying because she realized he isn’t better and what she has now is the best relationship. Brace yourself, he’ll be back and then you have some decisions to make."

bachelorinparadise,fdw3cxy,t3_emuwhw,1578754663.0,"I didn’t like Hannah that much when she was a contestant on the Bachelor. I liked her on her season of Bachelorette. She was very dramatic on DWTS. She didn’t take criticism very well. I don’t like that she keeps appearing on Peters season on Bachelor. Maybe it’s the franchise/show that is having her do this but I don’t think it’s fair. She had her chance and had an opportunity with Tyler (second choice on her season). It’s Peters turn to shine. Let him find love without her coming on and confusing him and making all the other girls uncomfortable. It wouldn’t be fair bringing her on because of their history. She was doing DWTS anyway so I don’t think she could do his season anyway. If Peter doesn’t find love or things don’t work out on his season, then maybe they could try again but not until after his run on the show is over."
