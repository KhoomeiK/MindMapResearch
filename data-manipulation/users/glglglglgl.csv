People consciously and unconsciously filter things through a lens - all of those people who had ""life-changing experiences"" just don't admit or recall the difficult times.

On my first day, I got a quick tour from the university's Erasmus coordinator, and then realised I hadn't written down the address of the accommodation (which I'd been at earlier that day) and got very lost on the campus - this being ten years back I didn't have a good smartphone - and there were a number of times in the first few months I was trying to figure out how to get sent home without quitting (because I couldn't afford to pay back any of the Erasmus loan) - but I stuck with it, mostly by choice and a little bit of shame/stubbornness, and by the end I was managing to function in French, even surviving an appointment with a non-English speaking doctor.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is, the start is difficult. But, it does get easier. One suggestion is to look for local meetup groups; especially language ones, as people are quite forgiving at those, as many of them will have been where you are.
