MakeNewFriendsHere,ff3c5r7,t3_er6eiv,1579538251.0,"Ex- cutter( for the most part) , I have my slips when I think I have no other coping options. Usually it’s to shut down having to feel whatever emotion I want to stay buried. It makes me feel calm and in control. So giving yourself permission to feel hurt/frustrated etc over what happened may help. Going through that with someone who you cared about can feel like such a betrayal. There’s a ton of emotions ( anger, disappointment, sadness , loss etc) that come up in a situation like that. That’s normal and although it’s uncomfortable as hell letting yourself feel all these valid things could give you the release of cutting but with healing coming about rather then more hurt. Easier said then done of course."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fco7kvo,t3_ei42nv,1577825614.0,This book is so good! I read it before the show and I’m so glad I did. Also lucky for you if you like the book there’s a new one out that she recently published that follows this one and gives it closure.
