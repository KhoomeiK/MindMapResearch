They are subject to harassment by family, friends, and strangers.  They have to defend their membership in the LGBTQIA+ community from aphobes on the internet."
TrueOffMyChest,fffpey1,t1_fffhqbf,1579888927.0,"Demisexuality is not just ""having standards"".  As a Demisexual, I have not experienced sexual attraction in over 15 years.  I have only felt it 3 times in my life.  Other than that I am asexual.  

Here is an example of how it works.  I worked with my friend Sherry and one day she brought her ex Bob to hang out with us.  Upon meeting him I thought ""Bob is kind of ugly, which doesn't make sense because Sherry is pretty cute and I don't understand how they ended up together."" Over the next 6 months or so, I got to know Bob really well.  We hung out almost every day.  I fell in love with him.  Then my inner dialog changed to ""Bob is hot AF.  I wonder if he would ever want to become intimate.  Why would Sherry ever let him go?""

It has nothing to do with how people look.  The things that suck are people constantly asking when you are going to date someone, why you don't have a boyfriend, etc.  The whole dating world is set up for you to look at someone and determine if you find them attractive and want to go out.  But I don't get that first part.  Dating apps use pictures, but everyone looks the same to me.  My only hope is that I fall in love with a friend again someday and I get lucky and they reciprocate the attraction.  It has never happened to me, but I hear it has happened to other Demisexual, so maybe there is hope?"

For me, that doesn't mean that I don't think about sex or even that I wouldn't have sex.  It means that there isn't anyone I want to have sex with.  It just doesn't occur to me.

I heard someone on one of these subs describe attraction as getting a ""pants feeling"", which I find funny and probably accurate.

For me, that doesn't mean that I don't think about sex or even that I wouldn't have sex.  It means that there isn't anyone I want to have sex with.  It just doesn't occur to me.
