ancientrome,feg55tw,t1_fef99ng,1579077405.0,"Yeah. It was a matter of a Commander is not very conservative or literally Rome is on fire. That gives you an impression, how harsh this siege was when Ceaser was almost literally running to help them. It was a funny story. Ceaser burnt some villages, built a fortified camp and sent cavalry ahead. When they found Gouls they broke almost immediately and was chased to the camps, where Roman legionnaires pretended to be panicking on the walls. Gouls were like what a cowards and they brought their entire army and demanded surrender. In response Romans opened their 4 Gates and killed most of the Gouls and set one the run the rest. One can only imagine Ceaser on the walls ""Surrender? Boys what do you say?"" Btw we were told that in Commander of the siege I think he was called Quintus. Don't quote me on that. I am not sure. For sure I know he didn't sleep for 3 days straight and was dragged by his officers to the tent to get some sleep. Each one of the legionnaires suffered some kind of injury and operated on minimal amount of sleep. Quintus wrote a letter to his brother describing the siege and in response he was told to stop whining. xD What a fucking guy."

ancientrome,fdmpwvf,t1_fdmmz0p,1578559967.0,"That's all true, but you have to understand, that reading wasn't as useful as today. Now a days you have internet, books and other stuff. Today literacy is required to function in our society. During times of Rome it was as popular as swimming not because they couldn't make schools mandatory and reading with them. Roman society was very cast like divided. Education was different and depended on where you were born. Now ask yourself a question. Would you spend your time to learn to read as a highway worker. You haven't read a book your entire life. Your father was a construction worker, he built houses, he thought you stuff. You sometimes see some written words, but it's not a big deal. In pub you can simply ask how much drink costs and no one thinks you are worse because of that. It's a pub for workers. Sometimes engineer, that is above you comes in to drink with you and chat about stuff. Now imagine. As this man would you spend your whatever free time you have to learn to read. It wouldn't be easy. You would basically have to find someone to teach you and how useful would it actually be for you."

Technologically we went ahead, but recognize 2 things. Technology and advancement in civilization are two different things. Caveman and the Inks had more or less similar technology, but you won't argue inks were far more advanced. They had empire with roads, word traveled at speed of their fastest runners, they had clean water distribution system and they had no idea what a wheel is. Incredibly advanced civilization.
