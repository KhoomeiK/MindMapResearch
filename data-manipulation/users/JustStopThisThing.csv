offmychest,ffht7hr,t3_etpbir,1579952672.0,Are you ok though? This post feels like you are going to kill yourself or something.
offmychest,ffhss0c,t3_etpenk,1579952036.0,"Yeah I'm feeling bad too. I thought I am close with this friend of mine and consider him as one of my best friend. But I guess he doesn't think the same. Oh well. 

Do you celebrate Chinese New Year? I don't but man, I love moon cakes. So damn delicious."

lonely,fezdmep,t3_eqx1lm,1579456241.0,What does your username stands for?
offmychest,fezb6j0,t1_feza02a,1579455596.0,"Nah, I do that too sometimes. Good luck on the exam."
offmychest,fe6go8g,t1_fe6gicb,1578890338.0,Nah. I read it back and I realize I read it wrong. Sorry about that. You're right.
offmychest,fe6fto3,t3_enyv65,1578889610.0,"That is so rude. I guess he's bored of her. But even if that girl was just a friend or whatever, you do not give out personal information without asking its owner first."
offmychest,fe6flso,t3_enyezx,1578889426.0,Sounds like you want to have that deep conversation with someone. I think you can achieve this by finding the right friend. But it is someting that is very hard to do all the time because this kind of conversation can be very exausting.
offmychest,fe6fdk2,t3_enymg9,1578889236.0,"Same. I just try to take one day at a time though. But its hard when you have no ambition or goals in life. Not to mention that even if I have one, it is something mundane, like getting better at cooking or whatever and not something that is life changing like getting better paid jobs. I guess I still don't know what I want to do with my life."
offmychest,fe6f0om,t3_enxo4s,1578888945.0,Happy birthday my dude! I hope you have a good day today.
offmychest,fe6emyj,t3_enuuap,1578888631.0,Good for you dude. I have always have respect for people in sales cause I sure as hell can't pull it off. Congrats!
offmychest,fe6eino,t1_fe6cti2,1578888536.0,What do you mean? I don't see anything wrong with it. Some people are just more emotional than others.
offmychest,fe6e5yc,t3_enr7lk,1578888252.0,"Me too, man. Although I did feel a little scared everytime before reading it, because they could be angry messages or jokes that I didn't get. And then, I don't know what to reply back lol."

MenGetRapedToo,fdjujlk,t3_ekorqa,1578487965.0,"Oh man, you know I actually came from your post a month ago on /r/askgaybros and..well, shit man, this sucks. I'm so sorry this happen to you. 

About your mom yeah maybe she feel guilty about all of this and she didn't know what to do about it, so she distance herself from you. But who knows? I mean its a lot to take in you know, after something this terrible happen to her own son.

I think you should just ask her straight forward why is she being distant. Is it because she feels guilty about what happen? If you just can't say all of this face to face, just call her. I don't really recommend texting though. Oh and I also don't recommend that you ask her if your dad also did something to her. I mean if something did happen, when she is ready, she will tell you. Just say that you will be there for her and you hope she will be there for you too. And do ask your mom to go to therapy. 

I know it is easier to say all of this, especially when you don't know what her answer will be but...this is all you can do at this moment. If you are still afraid to ask her, its fine. Just try to focus on yourself first. 

My heart goes out to you dude. 
I hope everything turns out well for you and your loved ones."
depression,fdjmje0,t1_fdjk3yi,1578478097.0,Thanks. I hope you are able to find ways to make you feel better too.
depression,fdjk1rz,t1_fdjjp8y,1578474489.0,"Yeah, I don't think it really is willpower. I mean I already over do it until I didn't eat for days. (But I am able to eat and do something today, so yay me!) 

Oh and maybe if you can, you can call your bank to disable online transaction from your card. Maybe that way, you can buy less stuff?"
depression,fdixxcg,t3_eljo33,1578453569.0,"Everytime I want to buy for myself impulsely or eating my heart out, I will tell myself that the happiness of doing these things are not going to last and might make me hate myself more, so might as well don't."

Btw, not to be rude or anything but as a non english speaker, using they for non binary in sentences, really confuse me. People really need to add other pronoun for non binary in their language. Like sometimes I don't know if they were referring to themselves or multiple people and the example can clearly be seen in OP's post. I will be having an even harder time to understand if this happen during a conversation."
offmychest,fcyp8jj,t1_fcylexc,1578084307.0,"Goddamn, that username."
offmychest,fcpvxtg,t1_fcpveun,1577873303.0,Its good dude. It feel cathartic to make your own ice cream. Or at least that's what its like for me.
offmychest,fcpvbuc,t3_eicw1v,1577872917.0,Now why don't you buy an ice cream machine. I heard it is another best thing ever.
askgaybros,fcpv2uk,t1_fcptd6g,1577872757.0,If you let me hold your hand while we're doing it. Maybe.

depression,fcjri4v,t1_fchu05s,1577700988.0,"I'm so happy for you! And its good that you believe in this one rather than the opposite of it that can send you to the deep ends. For me, I'm still trying to implement the optimistic part into my life and I'll know I'll get there someday."
depression,fcjrbap,t1_fchaf7s,1577700709.0,That's okay dude. I am also searching for reasons to live myself. I hope you will find yours too.
