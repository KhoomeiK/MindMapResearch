AskReddit,ff10xv1,t1_ff0bjb6,1579474146.0,I don't actually soak my feet in pee water LMAO. I just pee in the shower. I'm just saying that it's more healthy than unhealthy to do that.
AskReddit,ff0b2a1,t1_ff00pr3,1579467063.0,The funny thing is that standing in your own pee is somewhat healthy as urine is decently effective at killing foot and toenail fungus.
AskReddit,ff0ayu1,t1_ff050nr,1579467020.0,Its actually funny because urine kills foot fungus and it's actually a good habit to pee in the shower and have your feet soaking in pee water.

WTF you sound so annoying and exhausting to deal with. I wouldn't be surprised if you're the problem. Learn to take a joke. Anyone who has to specify they are beautiful and full of empathy is probably  neither of those things."
Showerthoughts,fdz2vog,t1_fdydcz3,1578786110.0,I don't think it was as bad as people imply it was but it definitely wasn't anywhere close to the genius that was season 1.
Showerthoughts,fdy3ryj,t1_fdxscxv,1578775782.0,It is hands down the best sci fi show created to date you're about to be like how the fuck have I never heard of this shit before after you get hooked midway through season 1. Then you have 3 more glorious seasons ahead of you with more to come. I'm jealous of you.
Christianity,fd3kvph,t1_fd3ddvx,1578159254.0,Imagine believing this deranged shit unironically LMAO
aww,fcom376,t1_fcoief9,1577835656.0,In all honesty you sound overly triggered.. hope the new year alleviates that for you
aww,fcod1sp,t1_fco1po8,1577829260.0,Yea me farming free karma makes me angry. You got me.
aww,fco339x,t1_fco2rcf,1577823155.0,They are exactly the same man but sure. Yes he is technically telling the truth if you choose to warp his words in such a way to mean that. But warping his words into your technical truth is just as slimy of a mechanic as the lie. That doesn't make it any better.
aww,fco2ro8,t1_fcnzmh7,1577822987.0,"I'll just repeat this again because you people actually think I care. This is just free low effort repeatable karma that actually that takes 0 effort. I'm just doing exactly what this OP did, except not stealing content. If you think I actually care about ""Reddit justice"" you are highly mistaken. Reddit cares about Reddit justice and Im just playing to Reddit's tendency to upvote people who call out people who steal content. I simply see a free easy karma opportunity that takes 5 seconds so I take it. Not really that weird. If you choose to extrapolate that I care about OP reposting that's on you. Seeing a free easy karma opportunity and abusing it isn't really that odd. That's what most of Reddit users do."
aww,fco28pb,t1_fcnz7bi,1577822734.0,"Nah it's just free low effort repeatable karma that actually that takes 0 effort. I'm just doing exactly what this OP did, except not stealing content.

aww,fco1yui,t1_fco0x81,1577822605.0,"You are misunderstanding what OP's intentions are. Like the other dude said, if you walk out of a movie and someone says ""hey glad you liked it please check out my next one"", that is 100% implying that he made the first one. He is making it purposefully ambiguous no shit. That doesn't mean he isn't implying that he made this shit. You didn't even see the comment from him before writing your comment. Stop trying to save face dude. Backing up people who steal content isn't really a great look."
aww,fcnyno9,t1_fcny4s5,1577820982.0,Thank you. The fact that people are actually defending this monkey of an OP is fucking hilarious to me.
aww,fcnwsbi,t1_fcnwno0,1577820004.0,You can literally follow users on Reddit dumbass. Where the fuck have you been? You probably just don't have the new Reddit profile enabled. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist lmao.
aww,fcnw5q0,t1_fcnvxao,1577819643.0,"Ok except he literally says this in another comment. It has just gotten so many downvotes it's now hidden:

&nbsp;

'You should follow me too then coz I have another one coming soon ;)'

&nbsp;

That literally implies he made this himself. Using the example from u/Dontkillmejay, if you walk out of a movie and some dumbass says ""glad you liked it, follow me because I have another one coming out soon"", that is outright implying that that person made the original. So yea you're technically just wrong buddy. Before you come to the defense of idiot reposters who claim their reposts are OC at least do yourself the favor of checking all the comments from the OP. Also, saying follow me if you're a fan of spot on captions technically implies he made these ""spot on captions"". If you're going to be so adamant about the technical truths of life at least get your technical truths accurate."

Gotham,fcbkrcj,t1_fcazng2,1577588007.0,Seconded... I love Gotham but AoS I would also put above it... Season 2+ are all fucking fantastic.
AskReddit,fc1krgu,t1_fc13z7r,1577321712.0,Candyflipping is by far the most optimal combination of drugs to connect and have the most intense intimate experience with a person. It is hands down my favorite combination of drugs. Both drugs intertwine and interact in such a way that the combination of them operates as an entirely new drug.
