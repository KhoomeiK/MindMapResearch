aspergirls,ff663sh,t3_eruhdh,1579620033.0,"I just... Really like Taylor Swift.

She's the only artist to have four albums sell 1 million pure copies in their debut week (also consecutively). She had three albums appear in the top 10 best selling albums of the last decade. If we were to only include female artists in that list, she would occupy 5 out of the top 10 positions.

She also broke the record for most entries on the hot 100 with 18 when all tracks from her Lover album charted in the same week.

She was also named billboards woman of the year twice and then capped it off by being billboards woman of the decade for her philanthropy work and her advocacy for LGBT+ and artists rights.

I just like numbers and T.S and sometimes I feel sorry about it because so many people judge for me being that way. Even here I feel a bit odd sharing cause I know shes polarising. But that's just the way my special interest went I guess when something or someone becomes a grounding tool. Can't tell you the amount of meltdowns her songs have eased or prevented."

fatlogic,fdsea3e,t1_fds585k,1578700705.0,"You're so right, it honestly feels like a betrayal considering how much I love cheesecake, but hey, I remember days where I'd eat two of those little things. Marginal improvements I guess lol."
AskReddit,fds7n8k,t3_emvveb,1578696197.0,"I personally have not been anywhere near as affected as some communities that have lost their towns and their homes, however just the air quality of where I live has made my city of 400,000 people one of the worst in the world when the smoke was at its worst. Myself and my brother had breathing problems while the smoke was at its worst. My mother was blocked in her town because the highways being closed on both ways in and out due to fire. If the wind had turned, she would have been trapped in it's path with no where to go.

Like I said, it's no where near as awful as it's been to other people, but it has affected a wider range of people than those directly in the fires path. It's awful for so many, but it has also shown some of the greatest human compassion I've seen in Australia in a long time with so many people coming together to help when it feels like those who could do more, are doing nothing. Little kids in my city had a lemonade stand that raised $1,500 for the fightfighters with the lemons and limes being donated to the children by the fruit shop they were in front of."
fatlogic,fds3ln4,t3_ems7pb,1578693753.0,"Rant: I ate 2500 calories yesterday. 1000 over goal because whoops I didn't realise that stupid teeny cheese cake was 650 calories just by itself.

Rave: At least I logged it honestly. 

Rant: I have the rest of forever to lose the last 20lb or so but God damn I want to just be at my goal weight right now so it's done and I can focus on maintaining instead. But no. Gotta get to a middle range bmi. 20lb feels like it'll take forever to lose at ~170lb compared to the 245 I started at.

Rant: OH also I had one piece of nutella toast at work yesterday. No big deal. And I used the tiniest amount of nutella to have a small scraping on the toast and my friend comes in and is all ""Don't put that away I'm gonna have some"" and she tells me how my blood sugar is gonna spike with all that nutella as she's taking an ACTUAL spoonful of nutella and eating that straight and I tell her hers is gonna spike higher now and she just says ""I took just as much as you."" In a completely serious tone. Then argued with me when I told her I had used maybe 1/4 of what she had just put in her mouth."
fatlogic,fdoaae8,t3_eltwdx,1578601591.0,"9 days into the new year and I've been at calorie count 7/9 days and under maintenance 2/9. Doesn't help that shark week decided to happen twice in one month but sure. 

It's casual Friday at work and I'm wearing a 2XL shirt cause my favourite artist was selling at 30% off and this size was all that was left instead of a medium. I used to be an 2XL and I'm positively drowning in this shirt and it's on my list of things to do to get it taken in a bit."
fatlogic,fdo6pty,t3_em9kad,1578599849.0,"I dunno, I'm not sure 'rotund' is an adjective I'd willingly like to describe myself, healthy or otherwise. But maybe that's my fatphobia jumping out."
fatlogic,fd7x1m7,t1_fd2ip1x,1578211347.0,"I can confirm the whole new people just assume that you've always been in shape. I started a new job at the end of July after having lost 80lb and when I got friendly with some of them and added them on facebook, they all were surprised and shocked to see my photos on facebook before I lost weight, one of them even saying ""I never would have believed that was you."""

1200isplenty,fcz4h0p,t1_fcxl3fu,1578093481.0,Happened to me back in July! I luckily had like 5 dresses that could pass for office wear. Guess who wore those 5 dresses on rotation for like 3 months? :)

fatlogic,fcsxypi,t3_eija9f,1577927921.0,"I got back on track on the 27th, I already dropped 4kg of the water weight, so I might have only regained 4ish kilograms since I moved interstate at the end of July. 

Also going predominantly vegetarian, so if anyone has any tips for that, I'd love to hear them. Especially if you still live with people who eat meat."

TaylorSwift,fcp77i0,t3_eia08s,1577852760.0,I did this too. It was actually really beautiful and I teared up a little since she's been with me for these past 10 (more like 12) years and how we've both grown up so much in that time.

People: It's so repetitive!

Me with a stick beating a dead horse: THATS. THE. POINT."
1200Australia,fcm9qvm,t1_fclvz9k,1577768082.0,"Essentially this. Our bodies are woefully efficient at energy management. You can eat a 2,000 calorie meal in 30 minutes and in that same amount of time you could burn a whole 200 calories on an exercise bike.

It's the worst, but watching your calories are where you're gonna see results. Weight loss is achieved 80% in the kitchen, not in the gym."
loseit,fchzvbz,t1_fcg4qvh,1577656088.0,That is some great reflection to do on Christmas no less! Way to go fellow tall lady!

1200isfineIGUESSugh,fc6prlt,t1_fc5cvb3,1577486398.0,"For me it was just the stress of moving halfway across the country for a new job, leaving my family behind and settling in there and adjusting to that new schedule. All in all it could have been a lot worse. I'm not gonna beat myself up about it because they were highly different and stressful factors I was dealing with."
