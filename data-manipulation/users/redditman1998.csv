formula1,ff9wl9v,t1_ff9uvrt,1579723087.0,This is exactly why Lewis > Schumacher. I'm glad to see Lewis take the records cos it's nice to have someone who has been a fair racer at the top.
formula1,ff8ryd7,t1_ff8rt0s,1579693729.0,"The thing is Mercedes were miles ahead at Abu Dhabi itself. This was with very limited upgrades in the second half of the season. Mercedes are still definitely the favourites this season again. Plus if Ferrari really were fucking with their engines, they might be limited this season as well."

formula1,fenv96p,t1_fenksny,1579291392.0,"I find this comparison odd.

A 4 time world champion and a veteran of the team should be handily beating a newcomer (to the team) and somone who has only spent a year on the grid.

Pretty sure no one will be making this many excuses for Hamilton if he got beaten by a relative rookie."
formula1,fehkfwo,t1_fehes01,1579118359.0,It definitely takes a certain type of genius to come to this conclusion.
formula1,fegvt66,t3_ep3suu,1579103659.0,Fuck no
formula1,feems9y,t1_fedyp43,1579036922.0,"That's cos when you perform consistently and win no matter the circumstance, you are basically entitled to do whatever the fuck you want."
formuladank,fed6x88,t1_fed6pq0,1579001769.0,"Yep. I know Vettel fans won't be happy to hear this but Vettel's only win of the season was more or less a fluke.

Cue comments claiming he did a great outlap. 

I won't deny it, but the front runners were controlling the pace and it is goddamn Singapore. Any driver in Vettel's shoes would be miles faster on a fresh set of tyres (not to mention the relatively little traffic he had on his outlap).

Also not to mention his fans making up every fucking excuse in the book to brush aside his errors that his team mate (who is only in his second season) does not make. Max and Leclerc and such a great battle for multiple laps in Silverstone but Vettel immediately went kaboom with Max and then had the audacity to blame him. The thing that gets me most is that his fans claim he is the best driver in the grid/F1 history only to go on and claim in the same breath that he needs a specific type of car to succeed. Hilarious. 

Before anyone calls me a hater, I think Vettel is a great person off track but don't like his on track attics (especially Baku 17) and I really don't think he is quite on the level of the greats in the sport."
formuladank,fed5sio,t1_fed4lwt,1579000280.0,"It was an accident, and Binotto more or less came out saying we let him win since we didn't order him to switch with Leclerc."

Good for him. Hope he is happy"
formula1,fdxn2xb,t1_fdwxnyg,1578770830.0,More like the AI was dominating when it glitched for a second and fucked up the race.
singapore,fduu1n1,t1_fdu3d1k,1578738826.0,Yes! It threw me off guard when I heard that sound as I was walking to the place I was staying
formula1,fdrhy8x,t1_fdrhsh7,1578684723.0,"Seems to be it is around the 500-600m mark. Mercedes were untouchable in France but tripped over themselves immediately at Austria.

I wonder if they have fixed those issues for this year."
formula1,fdrb31v,t3_emu5t4,1578681992.0,The three highest tracks are the three tracks Mercedes have typically struggled in. Interesting.
todayilearned,fdqejz6,t1_fdqei9a,1578664616.0,Dumb mistake. Thanks
todayilearned,fdqc5lb,t1_fdq8d3c,1578662663.0,"I once hold a Danish girl that I felt copenhagen was a bit like mini stockholm. I swear she would have murdered me then and there if she could. 

In fact, it has become my favourite thing to tell Danish people that I feel Denmark is like mini Sweden. Pretty certain I'm banned from Denmark for life."
