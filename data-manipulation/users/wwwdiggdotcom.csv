It's a racket, the Illinois government shakes down all the tourists for their money in any way they can, before the homeless can panhandle the rest. Then when you do try to go online and pay the tolls the website is down for maintenance, and if it's not down for maintenance, you better remember which toll it was that you missed, out of like 100 of them. But not the actual toll booth number, that giant number on the sign next to the toll booth? No, that's useless. You need the exact cross streets. Fuck Chicago. Fuck the entire state of Illinois."

Haven't had any warranty issues with my 6S or my XS. Much easier than calling, going through foreign tech support, hoping they believe your claim, waiting for the replacement, then shipping back your old phone, hoping they accept the claim once it arrives.

The DM would type out whatever story elements they wanted and the players would type their responses. The players selected units as their characters with unique abilities or stats, the map was very large but also very densely packed, they could only see near where their characters would see like a traditional RPG, only controlling that one unit. The DM would be able to see the entire map and control elements and structures and triggers in the map on the fly to match their quests, traps, encounters, and so forth. It was extremely advanced for its time and so much fun.

Even structures used in the game could be used as different shops or areas that could teleport you into an ""internal area"" somewhere else on the huge map that the players can't really see. Your party could ""enter a dungeon"" together and be transported to a whole new area where they could explore that dungeon, and come back out and end up in the same place in the ""overworld"" so to speak. You could walk up to structures and they could be programmed as a weapon shop and you could buy upgrades from them. God it was awesome."
