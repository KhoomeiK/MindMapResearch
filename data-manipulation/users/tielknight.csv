conspiracy,ff8pgzi,t1_ff8oumw,1579690394.0,"Yes I did, try watching it again around the 3-minute mark where the journalist mentions they were blown out of proportion and  mostly for re-education and the staffer replied that the person next to them hears the same spiel from him all the time so yes, they were.

Around the 3:40 mark the staffer states they will send republicans to those camps so yes they say exactly that so what is your excuse?"
conspiracy,ff8lfb4,t1_ff8i4jt,1579684234.0,"What are _you_ on about?  

What they said is correct, he has no spine (he apologized for his people calling Biden corrupt, which he is) and refuses to push back against his insane staffers calling lovely 'camps' like they mentioned. 

CBS has a article on him apologizing and veritas released footage of some staffers praising the gulags and wanting to send republicans and billionaires to 're-education' camps.

Ebay will still cover you sure but you'll also be funding them to continue pulling this shit."

YouShouldKnow,fek8lht,t1_fek5jqp,1579194871.0,"Bingo, the context in which that law was written is what matters here and unfortunately it keeps getting read as ""I didn't order it so this means I can keep it"".

They've posted for their products before and also apparently have 'expertise in marketing' according to their post on entrepreneur and that domain was registered [only 3 days ago](https://whois.domaintools.com/thegreenposse.ca).
