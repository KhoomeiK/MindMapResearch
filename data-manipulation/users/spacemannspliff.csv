Police are always going to be first on a scene - their cars are smaller and faster than ambulances and firetrucks and they patrol their neighborhoods, while EMS/FIRE is dispatched from base. 

You sound pretty damn naive if you think that the answer to police overreach is just having them not show up to the jobs where they're needed.

lifehacks,ffdng6a,t1_ffdjv6u,1579824609.0,"I understand your incredulity. but again, this occurred with both an iPhone and an Android.

According to the \~7 support people I spoke with and my subsequent experience, the only way to restore the phones (without visiting an AT&T store 3500mi away) was to purchase an international data plan ""just for the day"" so that they could register the devices on the UK carrier. They then had me perform an undocumented star code/SIM pin procedure (different for each device, had to be done in a certain order to unwind their system issues), then set the phones down for an hour while they pushed an OTA network settings update to each one.

Apple may have been responsible for the initial issue with the iPhone, but 100% of the following issues were failures of AT&T. Whatever they did successfully prevented a brand-new, UNLOCKED, ANDROID phone from working with any carrier other than their own outside of the US. Literally rejecting a SIM card that had worked in it a day earlier now that the AT&T SIM had claimed the device all to itself.

No, it shouldn't be possible. But it happened, and for what it's worth the reps I spoke with were apologetic and couldn't explain exactly how it happened. But the only way out was to allow them to charge me for international data. I do believe it was a bug, but it's convenient enough of a bug for me to suspect that they haven't worked very hard on fixing it. But the net effect was my devices being held hostage by the AT&T network."

lifehacks,ffdi5fv,t1_ffdfzgg,1579821367.0,"I'm aware of the issues with the flex program, but the problem with that explanation was that my iPhone was over a year old and had been purchased directly from Apple (unlocked), indicating to me that it was an improperly-managed software lock - it should have never been on that device.

But that was only half of the problem - when the US sim was removed and placed in another (android) phone for troubleshooting, that somehow updated AT&T's record of the associated IMEI and locked the SIM to the wrong phone, preventing it from being used in the iPhone.\* Both had to be reset (and special SIM pins entered) to restore them to normal.

I'm not saying that this is a typical situation, but the point is that properly ""unlocked"" devices shouldn't have issues like this.

lifehacks,ffd8uxj,t1_ffd1n9o,1579815694.0,"The bad part is the phone becomes locked as well, even if you purchased an unlocked phone.

I bought an unlocked phone specifically so I could swap SIMs around when traveling. After arriving in the UK, putting an international SIM into my week-old $1000+ phone, I learned that AT&T had locked my phone to their network. They literally installed ransomware on it, forcing me to pay for international service from them instead of using the device with the carrier of my choosing.

I spent over 6 hours (an entire night of jetlag) on the phone with AT&T support. They finally gave me some unlock codes to get it to work with the UK carrier, but still charged me for a month of International data (eventually reversed, another \~2hr call later)."

news,feh1p8l,t1_fegq841,1579107303.0,"> The proliferation of HOAs across the country are a blight. 

I agree with you. They make sense in the planned-use developments that were designed with them in mind - suburban subdivisions, gated communities, etc. 

They don't make sense in random, unincorporated areas that don't otherwise have a need for them. But they absolutely protect property values in areas where civil property law is *purposefully vague* to allow for them.

HOAs are really just a form of local government that emerged to fill the gap between ""we 9 homeowners want to sell our houses, but guy #10 just moved into the first house on the block and is using it as a slaughterhouse for his butcher shop"" and the civil court system saying ""we're not sure if that's ok, we'll need thousands of dollars and a few years to figure it out.""
