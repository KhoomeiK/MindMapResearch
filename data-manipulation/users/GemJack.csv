You've got that right.  On rare occasion I get a bit depressed and start to cherry-pick memories from the past that were pleasant and I start to miss her.  And then I  speak to her again (we have kids, can't be avoided) and within seconds feel like I can't get away fast enough.  My advice would be to focus on the treachery and betrayal, it's more in-line with the reality, and will definitely help you move on much faster."
