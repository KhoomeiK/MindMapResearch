bipolar,ffbubjq,t3_esnqu7,1579783008.0,"I’m also bipolar 1. Experience similar manic symptoms. Anxiety wise, marijuana is the only thing that works. Cocktails aside, there has to be a better way of life."
StonerThoughts,ff9r8yd,t1_ff9fgxf,1579719326.0,Nah naturally decaying teeth. It’s a family illness. Grandfather had his taken out in his twenties too. Combine that with a mental illness and poor dental hygiene you get a rotted mouth that needs to come out.
buccaneers,ff978zs,t1_ff8bt6f,1579706483.0,Been on #FuckDrewBrees for years. Glad someone else is too.
StonerThoughts,ff94ctg,t3_esbixe,1579704543.0,"I never eat when high. I barely ever get the munchies. I feel like it could be because I have no teeth, but I hate that stereotype. It speeds up your metabolism, but fight the hunger. Enjoy the high."
NoStupidQuestions,ff7vupy,t3_es3z2f,1579659578.0,Where I work only accepts debit with a pin.
NetflixBestOf,ff7vqp7,t3_es4v9p,1579659503.0,I liked Daybreak and Norseman. Daybreak was cancelled quickly but had its moments. Norseman was cool and comical.
bipolar,ff7vl2t,t3_es4xx2,1579659396.0,I’ve actually acted on my questioning while manic. Haven’t since but you can’t go around and tell other people you sucked a dick and fucked a guy in the ass and then expect them to look at you the same way. Just made me more comfortable that I like women. Sex is always something I do when manic.
jurassicworldevo,ff7n6lw,t3_es1cd0,1579653560.0,I lol’d at this.
StonerThoughts,ff6papz,t3_erxwqm,1579632047.0,Unless you have an orgy in which you’ve had sexual intercourse with everyone of the participating people’s past sex lives as well. And in some cases that could be hundreds or thousands of people. Picture that.
StonerThoughts,ff63a2a,t3_eru2ou,1579618052.0,I’m a nervous wreck not high. All over the place. Being under the influence allows me to not judge people as badly too. I catch myself being more apt to understand
bipolar,ff62a6w,t3_eruej7,1579617319.0,Feel this wholeheartedly. Never finding successful relationships to celebrate. Hooray I wasn’t manic enough to destroy my life for a year!
bipolar,ff45udi,t3_erj3a7,1579556199.0,Felt this. And trying to explain to someone who doesn’t have the illness makes it sound like you’re crazier than you are. I tried explaining my delusions to someone. Wow what an awkward hour.
StonerThoughts,ff45haw,t3_erjvna,1579555972.0,I hate sober me so much that I’m always high. Haven’t been sober in like 6 months.
bipolar,feybwf9,t3_eqsr3o,1579443470.0,"In some cases, like mine, church can be a trigger for psychotic symptoms like voices and delusions. I begin thinking of angels and demons and I become almost obsessed with the thought of it."
ComedyCemetery,fewmlpj,t1_fewmdz7,1579414801.0,Apparently you don’t friend enough girls you want to bang that annoy the hell out of you.
StonerThoughts,fewlegb,t1_fevc0d2,1579413539.0,Would also like to see the beautiful vaginas of said stars. Imagine sex scenes where you got to see them actually adjust the position.
bipolar,fevflxz,t1_fevfj98,1579396852.0,Tell me more about yourself.
bipolar,fevfauv,t1_fevcuy5,1579396734.0,Have you tried high grade cannabis?
ComedyCemetery,feunasq,t3_eqm2a7,1579388182.0,"Boomers and some Silent Generations hate the phones and think it’s going to destroy society, right?"
StonerThoughts,feum9ee,t3_eqn6ri,1579387892.0,I’d say emotion has something to play with it too. Pure awareness is a general answer but the tone of the things said could play a role too. Intelligence also playing a role.
StonerThoughts,feulfpy,t3_eqkvc6,1579387653.0,Cannabis creates people who think deeply. I don’t trust people who have never enjoyed cannabis for this reason.
StonerThoughts,fet94al,t1_fet8916,1579372889.0,Brother stepsister porn actors aren’t making you believe they’re related? Preposterous.
PaMedicalMarijuana,fes2bv3,t1_fes0j21,1579360664.0,"I should look at it this way. Just with something where my actual psychiatric doctors are against me using, and I experience symptom relief, I need someone knowledgeable. Found these rhythm cartridges that have worked wonders but that’s trial and error on expensive products."
trees,fere84n,t1_ferdx0g,1579352861.0,"After gibbing for a while though(10 year vet), the gib still has a taste. Some really shitty bud leaves an arsenic taste. While good bud(medical) still has an amazing taste. You don’t get the taste as you would from other sources, but the water plays a role. Just like glass gibs exist. Too complicated for myself to make one being a moron, but I’ve hit one before. Never got to the comfort level of saying they tasted smoother though."
Showerthoughts,fercifz,t1_feplbkl,1579352370.0,As someone who suffers from Bipolar disorder. Lithium is pretty easily understood.
trees,ferbyfa,t3_eqe0ct,1579352212.0,No water? Probably tastes like shit.
bipolar,fepo4uu,t1_fepo2xr,1579325796.0,Likewise. Another reason living in the 21st century rocks. Knowing someone else out there has a similar experience.
StonerThoughts,fepk973,t3_eqb8fa,1579322679.0,Which is why I be weary of what I’m consuming mentally versus how I’m responding mentally at any given time.
bipolar,fepk1vj,t1_fepjr3q,1579322521.0,"Came down on my own but was hospitalized eventually for another reason. Nearly killed myself between then though. I’m doing better now so at least I can talk about it sanely. As for the original point of the post though, I’ve got large gaps of shit I don’t remember. And it’s like literal parts of my life are missing and I can’t seem to remember if I was of sound mind or not. Scares ya sometimes. Makes me appreciate that Kanye song. Where he says Bipolar is my superpower."
bipolar,fepjhox,t1_fepj905,1579322100.0,Burning my clothes. Breaking windows of cars. All in all being a hellion. Sometimes I get flashbacks of it and then have a depressive period because of it. My psychotic symptoms have me thinking I’m an angel of some sort. That I’m in a spiritual fight. Religions a trigger so I stay away from that for now.
bipolar,fephupu,t1_fephqji,1579320890.0,Missing scheduled appointments due to other commitments. Our area is known for that shit and then I have to miss work.
bipolar,fephled,t3_eq8rya,1579320694.0,Felt this. Did irrational things my whole life when manic. People tell me things I’ve done and I’m like what? That’s cray cray man.
bipolar,fephghl,t3_eqazui,1579320594.0,"Stranger I don’t know...


I care about you and want to know what your damage is. Gotta be some good traits to yourself. The illness has to have some benefits. Focus on them. For me it’s manically writing. I strive to be that all the time though, so it’s a catch -22."
bipolar,fephb83,t3_eq8fp1,1579320488.0,Once handed my mom a knife and told her to kill me if she wanted to because of prednisone. Feel your pain. Get the help. Stand up for yourself about the drugs. Get the help you need. Best of luck.
bipolar,fepfzwb,t1_fep3k88,1579319550.0,Same I’m off for two days. It’s either clean the depression den or go to the dispensary to try RSO and be so high that I can’t function all day. Perfect time for a snow storm.
NoStupidQuestions,fepcb0e,t1_fepbv68,1579317021.0,Science behind this?
Showerthoughts,fepax69,t1_fep39ow,1579316094.0,Oh the ads on Facebook are going to be weird now.
PaMedicalMarijuana,fep7ugl,t1_fep74xh,1579314090.0,"Do I need more than a gram of RSO to make a decent product? Never invested edibles, so the active ingredient my liver makes will probably fuck me up. I saw the gummies but they seem too hard to make. I was hoping brownies or something similar. RSO is 75 a gram where I live."
PaMedicalMarijuana,fep56nn,t3_eq7t7q,1579312378.0,"I used to have to buy from a guy who was a heroin addict in the past or from a guy who was shot a couple years back. I’m much happier paying for convenience just wish dispensaries had more flower, not worried about price."
Showerthoughts,fep4sgh,t1_feof0mn,1579312128.0,This is the grossest thing I’ve ever heard in my life. And makes me never want to be homeless again and have to stay at some shady motels.
explainlikeimfive,fep4ofg,t3_eq6wua,1579312058.0,I’d argue piracy has led me to more artists that I would have never listened to either way. They make a lot of their money touring from what I’ve read. Which makes me wonder how non-touring artists make money.
trees,fep31ol,t1_fenbipm,1579311015.0,All I got was a life shattering conversation with myself that made me really love the drug. Then we went to Sheetz. Sheetz is pretty dope when high.
FuckedUpThoughts,feoy3zq,t3_eq5ncz,1579307904.0,I’d catch them too often. I wish I knew a serial killer so I could ask him questions though. Wouldn’t even turn the bastard in. Just want to know what his rush is.
PaMedicalMarijuana,fenh3tc,t1_fengmcl,1579284556.0,That sounds awful.
bipolar,femyb03,t3_epzq0r,1579272731.0,Feel this. So counter productive but offers a comfort.

jurassicworldevo,felwwl9,t3_epuffr,1579232985.0,The entire process is infuriating.
Piracy,felwjyd,t3_epp3jy,1579232725.0,Please stop ruining live sports piracy. It’s my favorite thing about the internet.
