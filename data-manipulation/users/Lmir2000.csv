How on earth does it make any difference if it’s intentional?"
fatlogic,ff06txy,t3_eqyzqn,1579465788.0,"I know first hand that gravity can be a real bitch. I’m 5’4 and when I weighed over 200 lbs, I started to notice that I would get tired quickly and needed to frequently sit down. Especially going to places that involved a lot of walking or standing for extended periods of time. Like outlets, malls, airports, board walks etc. And why wouldn’t that happen? That’s a lot of gd weight to carry on a 5’4 frame. Of course it’s going to take it’s toll on me. That’s one reason I wanted to lose weight. Another reason was because of the dreaded chub rub between my thighs. So yeah Karen, one reason I wanted to lose weight is for my own personal comfort. It has nothing to do with gaining other’s approval."

fatlogic,fe3g1k7,t1_fe34xqo,1578848952.0,I actually do use the scale on a tiled floor in my bathroom. Another thing worth noting is that I even tried to weigh a dumbbell several times without on changing the location of the scale (The scale still being in the bathroom) . It shows an accurate weight of the dumbbell which is 8 lbs EVERY SINGLE TIME.
fatlogic,fe2h8h9,t3_en8h4h,1578838343.0,"I don’t know what to do, I got a new digital scale for Christmas and it’s faulty af. I will weigh myself in the morning before breakfast and after I’ve gone to the bathroom and each time I step on it, it will show me a different number. Sometimes up to a three pound difference. And I always make sure it’s set on 0.0 too. It’s been doing this for an entire week. I’ve been averaging 1160 calories all week. This morning, it tells me that I’ve made progress and my weight has gone done, but when I step on it again, it shows me a 1.5-2 pound pound difference higher, and then a .5 different lower. Then, it showed me a number that was even HIGHER than last week. Oh, and another thing it does, it will switch numbers back and forth really fast until it shows me the final number. I really want to lose the rest of this gd weight, but there’s no way to know if I’ve made any progress whatsoever when the scale keeps being a little bitch. 🤬"

fatlogic,fdp37ed,t3_emav3d,1578618921.0,Sam’s club has Chinese food in the frozen section that’s lower calorie. There’s a vegetable Chow Mein  and they also have fried rice and Orange Chicken together in one box. One bag of Chow Mein is 500 and one serving of rice and one serving of chicken add up to 550. I think they’re both a close enough alternative to take out.
fatlogic,fdl5jvt,t3_eluhvm,1578517416.0,A lot of them will say that “Set point” is what largely controls weight rather than intake and expenditure and that fat people actually don’t consume more energy than thin people and “Skinny genes” and “Fat genes” exist.
fatlogic,fdfo3tn,t3_ekway9,1578366180.0,"I’ve been wondering lately, what is it like to lose/maintain weight whilst being in a relationship? I’ve never been in a relationship before and I wanted to know what’s it like?"
fatlogic,fdcbjcd,t1_fdc9vs3,1578270995.0,"As long as I’m not being derogatory, I can choose to title my posts however I want. And by the way, a lot of people on the internet type this way, usually when mocking someone or something. So it isn’t anything new.🤷‍♀️"

fatlogic,fcrienh,t3_eija9f,1577902224.0,"I just wanted to rave and express how proud I am of myself. I went to Ruby Tuesday with my family and I ordered the salad bar with my entree. In the past, when I would order the salad bar, I would repeatedly get up and grab multiple plates of salad. Even when I felt full, I would force through it regardless out of greed. This time though, I just got one plate and I didn’t even finish it. I got full enough halfway through. And when I did,  I stopped, I didn’t abuse the food and eat it purely out of greed. It feels good to not live to eat anymore. 😊"
fatlogic,fc6pr1g,t3_egc9c3,1577486386.0,"Rant-ish: I was watching one of Linda Bacon’s videos on YouTube where she gives one of her spiels. And towards the end of the video this is what she says “Of course, I’m not saying that everyone who is fat is healthy. I’m not saying that everyone is at an ideal weight. I’m not dismissing the notion that weight affects health” Even Linda fucking Bacon admits that she doesn’t deny weight affecting health. I wonder if any FAs/Thin allies have caught that."
fatlogic,fc3yg23,t1_fc3vbqr,1577401867.0,"Yeah, that’s exactly what I think. If our bodies are so hardwired to resist weight loss, then why would the law of thermodynamics even apply to humans? Why would it even be possible for energy stores to be reduced in the first place?"
fatlogic,fbybj88,t3_ef5220,1577212787.0,Fucking yes! 👏👏
