mintmobile,ff5t8w0,t3_erot7d,1579609383.0,"Customer service is the worst I’ve ever seen. I thought Sprint was bad, but Mint is much worse. Very limited hours, based on west coast time.  Even worse, they don’t speak English very well, and never seem to understand any questions beyond the most obvious ones.  

One of our phones won’t get or send MMS messages.  After half a dozen call with them over 2 weeks, we finally gave up.  They couldn’t figure out how to fix it so they insisted it must be because this phone is incompatible with their service. We point out that we have 2 of the exact same phone on Mint and the other one works perfectly, they have no response.  

What’s worse, they cancelled my son’s account for no reason, and it took 2 full days, 5 calls, and hours on hold to get them to turn it back on. They said it was because my billing option didn’t work, but it was their own credit in my account for the 3 free months. It automatically rolled into the free months on my other 3 accounts.  The customer service reps couldn’t figure out how to fix it. Neither could their technical support. It was escalated and then escalated again because they couldn’t figure out how to get it to take the credit that was already in my account. I had to insist on speaking to a supervisor and explain all of the times I was lied to, hung up on, and given incorrect information before they finally took the matter seriously. Somehow, less than an hour after that conversation, it was turned on. Before that, they just to me to wait another 24-72 hours, after already going 2 days without service. 

I cannot recommend this service."

politics,fewcco7,t1_fewagbn,1579408306.0,He committed the crimes in NY for decades. Moving to FL isn’t going to get him out of that.  They need to get Don Jr and Ivanka and Giuliani too.
politics,few7wpe,t1_few5vf8,1579406639.0,We’ll see. I think they’ll do their best. They hate him more than anyone else because they’ve known he was a conman for much longer than the rest of us.
politics,few4uk0,t1_feu9gt3,1579405390.0,"Unfortunately, the ones I know hate Trump, but still claim that he’s the lesser of 2 evils because they’ve been brainwashed into thinking Hillary is the devil.  So while they’re disgusted by trump, they’re likely to vote for him anyway because Fox News has taught them that all Democrats are evil."

mintmobile,felifh7,t1_fegn05h,1579222930.0,"I can’t get over just how bad their customer service is.  They keep telling me things that are clearly untrue,and don’t seem to have the ability or knowledge to fix anything."
mintmobile,feli9fb,t1_fegkhpp,1579222813.0,"I had to call them 3 more times to get this corrected.  The 2nd rep escalated it. The 3rd rep ignored that and started from scratch, then hung up on me after 30 minutes. The 4th one said they escalated the escalation because they still couldn’t figure out how to get the system to take the credit that was already showing in my account. At that point, I asked for a supervisor and wouldn’t let him go until he agreed to follow up on it.  It turns out the first rep was lying about their system being down the before. She couldn’t figure out how to get it working and just lied to me to get me off the phone.

I really don’t trust Mint at all anymore.  Every one of these reps tried to sell me the 12 month extension, even as they were telling me they didn’t know why my service was suspended and couldn’t figure out how to fix it.  Why would I want to extend such an unreliable service?"
