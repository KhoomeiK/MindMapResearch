Even then, I’m still in the gutters. I still feel as you feel. But I trudge on. Because I know there is something better then what I’ve had to endure.

See a therapist. Do some work. Life is not easy but it is so fucking worth it. DO NOT take your chance away at finding happiness. Someone will miss you... Someone will miss you. I’m sorry you are in so much pain. Please love yourself today and do something you would do for your best friend to yourself. See a dr. See a crystal dude. I dunno but you need to reach out."

Call them before you do something you can’t come back from.

Please, your life is worth more than you think it is."

Don’t worry about what people think of you.

Taking a martial art like jiu jitsu may not cure your feminine charm but it will make you more confident in your daily life."

Guitar,ff0htv6,t1_ff0h9xx,1579468998.0,"Really, a half hour lesson once a week would suffice. Just make sure you practice everyday what they give you. It’s not the time spent with teacher that matters it’s you making a point of putting what they give you into practice."

Guitar,ff0ebdn,t3_er1ip7,1579468067.0,"I don’t recommend teaching yourself. Get a decent teacher. You will grow leaps and bounds with a dedicated teacher rather than focusing on a bunch of YouTube content. I’m not saying it can’t be done. It’s just a difference of hitting the ground running  vs crawling.

There are things a teacher will do for you that the internet just can’t. Teach you proper technique, guide your practice time, show you how to learn, hold you accountable for progression. 

Your money will be well invested with a teacher. If it’s a good teacher, than it will show even more when 6 months down the road you are surpassing someone who learned how to play fast on youtube."

AskMen,ff0agll,t3_er1x1x,1579466898.0,Foreplay is a bigger part of the picture than just intercourse. Sex should be fun. Communication should take a seat in the room. there’s nothing wrong with being a beginner. the clitoris is not a toggle switch. The penis is not just a rubbing stick. good head is an art form and is not a one size fits all stimulant. Different strokes will please different folks. Pay attention to your partner and you both will reap the rewards.

dating_advice,fevnn7j,t3_eqq5cr,1579399417.0,Just tell her you’d like to take her to dinner. And then tell her your intentions on a walk after dinner. I find being forthright and direct is always appreciated.
musicproduction,fevnfm8,t3_eqjm9c,1579399331.0,I know the 2015s had some issues with keyboards and screens so be weary. The duos are okay but still a quad will be ideal for daw.

musicproduction,fet0ujv,t3_eqjm9c,1579370813.0,"I use a budget 2013 iMac for ableton that was reasonably Spec’d when it came out 7 years ago. I’ve got 16 gb of ram and a quad core CPU. 

My experience with Mac before 2014 is that they’re usually built pretty solid but they are definitely prone to be obsolete within a short amount of time I am currently looking to upgrade to a 6 or 8 core depending on sale prices or what I can find for cheap. And I am even looking to walk away from macOS in favor of upgradeability later down the road.

Your question is fair tho. IMHO I think you should look for the best cpu you can get for the money rather than the type of computer it is. Try to look for something with an 8th generation intel i7 8750 and if you can’t afford that at the very least a decent quad core intel. VRAM won’t matter so that will drastically lower the price of whatever you can  your hands on.

8gb of ram is good 16gb would be better.

plenty of I/O for connectivity

Put your money into the cpu. the latest amd ryzen computers are even worth a look if you’d like to take a look at some of the newer stuff if you’re worried about longevity."

musictheory,fdm4bbz,t1_fdm37xf,1578539468.0,"If there are two notes being played at the same time at any point in “traditional Arabic music” that is a harmony. It may not be harmonious to a western scale but the definition of a harmony is: the combination of simultaneously sounded musical notes to produce chords and chord progressions having a pleasing effect. Again, this may not be pleasing to a western scale but it is pleasing to someone while there is a mention of non uniformed progression I’m sure that the musicians will get into some kind of “groove” for lack of a better term.

I never defined silence as music. I said absence of rhythm or having a lack of rhythm. You defined silence as music, I did not. Silence can be used in music for tension or other uses defined by the artist. But I never mentioned silence as anything other than something lacking; harmony, rhythm, and melody.

And every sound does have a pitch. At least in the earths atmosphere. even when there is a lack of atmosphere you can still get a radio frequency from something out in the universe which can then be put to pitch. although we can only hear roughly 20 Hz to 20 kHz which in the grand scheme of things is not much. 

So in essence. What is silence?"
musictheory,fdlx1mz,t1_fdlo8k0,1578534547.0,What genre doesn’t have harmony? A rhythm no matter how “lacking” is still a rhythm (Not to be confused with tempo.) If it can be construed to a measure you have a rhythm. Silence is the absence of all 3 elements so it negates your point all together.

musictheory,fdlaflz,t3_elzavo,1578519856.0,While your ideas are thought provoking. They don’t add to the conversation of music being comprised of those 3 elements being wrong. A melody that you can remember even if it’s abstract. Dissonance can still be construed as harmony. And the abscense of a rhythm could still be considered a rhythm. I personally don’t see whAt your argument is arguing. Can you share some context?
