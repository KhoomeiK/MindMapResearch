The one thing that keeps me from freaking out and beating the shit out of someone in frustration is focalin. No deep breathing, no freaking out. It’s a chemical imbalance in my brain.

AskReddit,ffcjfft,t1_ffcdwd7,1579800743.0,As someone in Realestate I’ve seen people that have no business being in it because of this mindset. It’s more than just showing a house and having people magically sign a piece of paper to get the house. On the other hand I’ve seen people with no degree make 1m+ a year. It all depends on the person. If you are a go getter and can learn quickly I’d second this opinion.

Honestly I would take the kit. It had a 427 side Oiler and straight cut gears. The guy tracked the thing. He drove it to the gas station, around town, didn’t have to worry about it.
