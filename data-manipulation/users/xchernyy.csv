Also, you say ""women"" because obv women have to carry the child. However raising the kiddo is nothing a women has to do, men can do it just fine so i really don't see why women can't be the ones making the money and men stay at home with kids. I know that this is still ""new"" somehow but i also see it's changing so i'll just hope the change continues. :) Minds will follow and this women-ish thinking of needing a man to bring home money and provide stability will eventually vanish and the ones who want a career will hava a career and the ones who don't won't, regardless of gender."

FriendshipAdvice,femahmf,t3_epth39,1579245990.0,"Hi, i think this discussion is not about the n-word. You wouldn't come very far if you try to explain to her why she shouldn't say it in privat. IMO you should just ask her why she uses this word. Like, why does she even WANT to use it if she knows the origins and history of both people of color and the language we use to talk about them? That's the issue. Compare her to you - you are aware of the ugly racism and you just don't want to use this word. So, eather she is not aware and that's why she is using it and an educational discussion could help. Or she is aware and she wants to use it anyway because she doesn't give a f**** and because she is racist. Tbh this drunk-conversation makes me think it's the latter. Reverse-racism is pretty tough sh*t when you think it through. Good luck anyway."

Just please believe me when i tell you there are people out there who don't give a fuck about awkwardness, lack of social skills, autism, anxiety, whatever.

In the end it's you who lived your life, not me, so i don't want to tell anything about your life. I'd just like anyone in your situation to maybe reconsider the type of people you try to get liked by, the people that you are surrounded by or even the people who taught you what it means to be ""nice, kind, considerate and respectful"". Like, look at this post. You saying ""damn i'm weird and i'm trying to be good to people but nobody likes me"" and just look how many kind answers you get. We are all f\*\*\*ing real people here, you know? We exist. And i myself would tell you everthing i just wrote down to your face and have a cup of coffee with you so maybe you could reconsider declaring yourself not worthy of friendship."

Most people here will probably ignore the gender pay gap and existing dificulties for women in male dominated areas or simply downvote your post but that doesn't make them right. I would say you check out each company online (at least the ones you'd really like to work for) and listen to your gut. Some even explicitly mention that they want to encourage women to ""be an  engineer"" or whatever. If the higher staff is listed online you can check out if there are women. Even then i would probably find a space not that prominent to put it on your resume.
