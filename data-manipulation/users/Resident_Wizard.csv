IllegalLifeProTips,ffewfsq,t1_ffe42jh,1579868349.0,So did your father come back from the dead?

Reddit has turned into an ironic meta of complaining about this sites historical references. (I guess technically this post would fall into that category r/selfawarewolves)"
baseball,ffea3m3,t1_ffe0y6c,1579840925.0,The MLB might be the worst ran major sport. The NFL fucks up *a lot* but they at least evolve to try and do the right thing for the future of the game. Baseball seems to have some crazy *don't ask don't tell* policy when it comes to cheating. And they somehow still haven't figured out automatic strikes and balls even though the technology has been around for well over a decade.
baseball,ffe9sey,t1_ffe82jl,1579840658.0,Can you explain to me how me sitting through less pitching changes doesn't increase pace of play for the length of the game? The game time is shorter with a relatively similar amount of pitches being thrown.
Competitiveoverwatch,ffbv4bk,t1_ffbs4l8,1579783792.0,They do. The post above is about the vocal minority.

This is just straight bullshit. If you cheat there are literally no negative ramifications."
