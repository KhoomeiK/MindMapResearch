news,ffoioza,t3_eubjfc,1580078037.0,"So Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash. Also there were 5 other people on board who don’t have names because they aren’t important enough to mention.

Oh wait, his daughter died, so we better mention her because she is more important than the other people on board, you know for being born to a famous basketball player. 

And before anyone says “you are so full of it who will care when you die? He is famous!” It was helicopter crash. Near LA. You could be a nobody and if you die in a helicopter crash near LA, it’s probably news worthy to mention your name.

Cheaper shoes scuff and scratch easier and look like shit in about a month of consistent wear. The soles wear out way faster and they can’t be restored. They do not feel as good and it’s extremely obvious to spot a cheap pair of shoes vs. a quality pair. 

To circumvent wearing nice shoes in snow, rain etc. you can either carry them inside and put them on, or get a pair of shoe covers to wear outside. The shoe covers look stupid as hell, but it beats ruining shoes."

Without getting into too much detail about the actual equipment, he was about 3-4 feet off the ground on a piece of equipment and slipped and his foot got stuck in between an open space and a bar, sort of catching or “locking” his foot in the space.

He then proceeded to fall backwards and ended up about 90 degrees sideways, snap. He was suspended in mid air with his leg caught hanging there stuck by his foot. With his femur snapped. You could literally hear it crack. The guys had to lift him back up to take him out. It was fucked up."

They don’t fit as snug/nice or may rub.

Once you get to $400-500 plus, these things drastically decrease if not all disappear. I started only wearing $400+ dress shoes and I will never go back. You have to take care of them too though. Clean, polish, shoe trees, keep them out of water etc."
