I grew up in one of the best public school districts in California, if not the nation - Palo Alto.   Yet when I moved to a small town in Wisconsin, I was impressed with our public schools - the facilities were good, the teachers were lively and engaged and not there just passing time, and they had done an early intervention with ECE for our LD son who didn't really speak until he was 4 years old.  Sure, the offerings are limited when you only have \~100 students per grade level, but we certainly had the basics and more.

What really stood out was when the middle school needed to be replaced, the old one was a firetrap and was very outdated, and not ADA compliant.  In Wisconsin, first there has to be a meeting of the electors to approve putting the bond measure on the ballot.  Around 200 people showed up in the gym of the high school for this meeting.  I saw a lot of silver hair, and I thought this was going to be difficult to get passed since they didn't have children in the school.  I was wrong.  The measure was approved to be put on the ballot by a vote of 195-5.  Those were the grandparents, and they cared enough to tax themselves so their grandkids could have a better education.

The penultimate paragrpah was edited each time to reflect the other senators other than the one I was writing to:

Dear Senator \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Although   I'm not one of your immediate constituents, I am asking that you   consider taking my issues under your wing since much of the Senate   leadership isn't going to.  I am writing as one of your greater   constituents - an American citizen - to ask that you help assure all   Americans that we get a fair impeachment trial in the US Senate.

The   steps to assure a fair trail will occur when the rules for the trial   are adopted.  I strongly believe the following key points need to be   addressed in the rules making process to make sure this doesn't turn out   to be a sham and a shame on the Constitution:

1. All   witnesses called by the prosecution should be compelled to testify.    Chief Justice Roberts should only deny witness subpoenas based on   relevancy to prevent this serious matter from being turned into a circus   of misdirection.  If necessary, Chief Justice Roberts should be  allowed  to grant immunity from prosecution based on the testimony  given.
2. Chief   Justice Roberts shall be authorized to remove Senator jurors who are   challenged on the basis that they are not going to decide the case based  on the evidence presented, such as Sens. McConnell and Graham (based  on  their documented pre-trial statements); have inherent conflicts such  as  McConnell (wife is Secretary of Transportation); or are potential   witnesses (Ron Johnson).
3. That   the votes to convict and remove and prohibit from running for office   again be conducted by secret ballot.  We allow juries in criminal trials  this privilege to protect their safety, it appears it may be necessary   for the political and possibly physical safety of Senators.

Without  these basic fairness principles, the country is going to be further divided.  We need to do the impeachment in a manner that provides a result that can be accepted as the ending the framers of the Constitution, our founding fathers, and all those who have helped shape American democracy for the past 243 years would expect to see.

Please work with the Democrats, and encourage other specific Republicans - Sens. Collins, Alexander, Roberts, Enzi, Murkowski and Romney - who may be inclined to join with you to make the rules of the impeachment trial reflect the gravity of the issues at hand.

Thank you from one of your ""greater constituents""-

On December 17, acting Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan  stated that 93 miles of new wall has been built during the Trump  administration; according to CBP figures, at least 90 miles of that  replaced existing structures.  [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_wall)

Considering that the border is over 1,900 miles long, and 1,300 miles are still unwalled, I think it will take a long time before the wall is built.  At the rate of one net mile of wall per year, it will take 1,300 years.  

And Mexico is not paying for it."
