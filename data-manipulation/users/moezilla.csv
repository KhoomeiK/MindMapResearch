-make/upgrade/equip nomadic shoes asap also the monacle item in the top of the accessories list ( forgot the its name). Later the portable container ( also a good basket when you can max it).


-never waste more than one day making an item, and register everything.


-marion and Odelia are bonus characters (originally plus or dlc) you don't need to raise their friendship lvl for events, so don't waste time with them early game


-sometimes on the L1 menu you'll get (info) about strong enemies appearing on certain maps, I think these are supposed to get you more exp. When you go to the map it'll use one day, after you beat the monster you can  also kill all the other monsters on the map without wasting a second day to get more exp, just keep an eye on your ""time blocks"" you might even have some extra time to gather once or twice.


I made a few mistakes but still beat the main story with 10 months to spare at max lvl.

As an artist I could draw two stick figures having sex and claim the characters portrayed are underage, and thats child pornography in Canada. Alternatively I could draw two people with adult features having sex but someone else could decide that the characters look underage and that would also be child pornography, I could be charged with production of child pornography.


However the laws are rarely enforced and for a long time people only got charged for possession of ""virtual child pornography"" if they also had real child pornography (to add to the count I suppose?), Recently however that isn't the case anymore, I remember a case where a guy in Edmonton  got arrested for having only manga, and no actual child pornography. Another man in Quebec was arrested for watching hentai videos, but no actual child pornography.
