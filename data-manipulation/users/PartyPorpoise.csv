bookscirclejerk,ffyg2s2,t1_ffwwmna,1580345577.0,"Personally I think it would be beneficial to assign science non-fiction books. Lots of schools already do this with history, so why not assign something like *Cosmos* or *Last Chance to See*? Admittedly I am very biased towards science non-fiction, ha ha. But I do think books like that could help kids see science as more personal and relevant, as opposed to being some cold, unfeeling thing that only people in labs really need to know."
bookscirclejerk,ffyequ9,t1_ffy9tvt,1580344668.0,"Yeah, I was really surprised with how few books we read in high school. I wonder what the reasoning for the shift to short stories is. Maybe it has to do with time management. Like, I'm wondering if teachers don't want to deal with trying to get kids to read outside of school, so all reading assignments have to be done in class, and that makes it difficult to assign a lot of books. Not to mention the extra expense of getting class sets of books, especially if the kids take the books outside of class."
bookscirclejerk,ffyen7t,t1_ffy5ugj,1580344601.0,"What often happens is that students like that coast for a while, then when they hit a point where the material starts to become challenging (high school or college) and you can't get an A doing the bare minimum. The kids who have been able to coast never developed the discipline to study and their grades start to slip.

I also suspect that a lot of ""gifted"" elementary and middle school kids are really just early bloomers. They average out when they get older."

Sure, a few assignments were a little dull (I don’t wanna fucking hear anyone bitch about reading Shakespeare when my school assigned Salt: A World History!) but because of my mad skillz, I finished those assignments quickly and spent the rest of the class reading whatever I wanted. (or drawing) That’s why I don’t believe anyone who says that they failed school because it was too easy for them and they got bored. They just don’t want to consider that they might not be the intelligent intellectuals that they want to identify as."
bookscirclejerk,ffwmtmb,t1_ffw9kzb,1580305788.0,"Because when you’re in elementary school, people are happy to see you reading anything since the emphasis is more on the ability to read. Any book is gonna help with that. But when you get older, the focus shifts to analysis and people don’t understand why they don’t get praised for reading just anything."
Teachers,ffvn9qr,t3_evf7du,1580268144.0,"As a sub... It would be helpful if teachers left notes on whether certain students are allowed to leave early, or if it's okay for them to go to other classrooms to do work. At my high school, that wasn't a thing, but at many of the schools I sub at, it's commonplace. (I do sometimes get notes or calls from other teachers about it so I know it's not just the students BSing me) If it's a school or class where the students do their work and aren't prone to skipping class I usually give them the okay, but it's a lot harder to make a judgement when I'm at a school with a severe truancy problem and I can't get ahold of the other teacher because these also happen to be the schools that don't include a phone directory in the sub folder.

Also, if you have difficult classes, please try to avoid having subs administer tests! As a sub, I have to pick my battles, but on test days, I know I have to hold the students to a higher standard and monitor them more carefully. If you must have a test on a sub day, please be explicit on whether the students are allowed to use notes or textbooks, and other rules like that.

I hope I'm not coming off as whiny, but test days at some of these schools can be so stressful for a sub..."

For just an extra dollar or two, I can get a package of chicken breasts and some zucchini and yellow squash, and that lasts me at least three meals. (I already have vegetable oil and seasoning at home so I'm not factoring that in, but those are inexpensive too)"

But when I did, it turned out that I didn't gain a single pound! Guess all of that walking made up for those extra calories. (swimming in the Mediterranean helped too, lol) I'd kill to live in a place where I could do all of my daily stuff from walking and public transportation. (in a reasonable amount of time)"
todayilearned,ffs86kt,t1_ffrrdx9,1580175516.0,"A few years ago I did some volunteer work for an organization that did kayak nature tours. I mostly helped out with middle school field trips. One day, we got a group of low income kids from the city. All but two of the kids were full on obese. (one seemed healthy, maybe a little overweight, another looked underweight) Not chubby, not even overweight, they were so big that I can confidently say that they were obese. Because of poverty and city living, they didn't go out to play much. (also they had terrible diets) They struggled SO MUCH with the kayaking, they had shockingly little stamina, strength, energy or coordination. We only went about half the distance that we normally did for that age group because they just couldn't go very far. The only kid who did well was the only one who was at a healthy weight/maybe a little overweight.

Almost every kid just brought big bags of chips for lunch (I assumed that was because it was a field trip, yay, special occasion treat, but according to the teacher they ate like that every day!) and their teacher also told us that several of them were pre-diabetic. Again, this was a class of middle school children. If they're already dealing with major health and mobility issues before they even hit high school, what will their health look like when they're 20? 30? Shoot, are some of them gonna die of obesity-related issues before 40?"
