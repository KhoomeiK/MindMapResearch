minnesota,ffbig8p,t1_ffa938n,1579766797.0,"Other breweries are making a whole lot more product so they can take advantage of economies of scale that small-scale operations just don't get. For example, it costs a lot less per gallon of product delivered to maintain a fleet of delivery trucks than a single van because it makes more sense to do things like hire your own mechanics rather than pay a shop, by parts wholesale from the manufacturer rather than getting them at a retail auto parts store or through a dealership, but a small brewer might not move enough product to justify more than a van. So now their overhead per keg sold is higher, even though total overhead is lower."

AskReddit,ffapowz,t1_ffamzf5,1579741574.0,"There was actually a whole thing about this, and you've caught on to something here - they *did* do something different.  For one thing, they owned their store locations whereas Blockbuster leased.  So if a blockbuster store couldn't pay their rent they'd have to shut down, but once the payments were paid out on a Family Video store then a huge chunk of their overhead just went away, and they also had an asset they could borrow on (like taking out a home equity loan on your home).

Related to that, because they owned the stores they could do structural changes.  They partnered with a pizza chain when they realized they didn't need as much floorspace as they had, remodeled their stores to cut about 2000 square feet out of their stores and convert that to a pizza place that their partner then opened a franchise in, then they did movie/pizza combos - get a pizza, get a free movie rental!
