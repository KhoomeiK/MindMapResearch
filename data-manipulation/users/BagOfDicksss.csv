NoStupidQuestions,fewwlun,t3_eqgp33,1579420621.0,My two semester experience studying abroad in the UK was a million times better than my entire undergrad study in the US. I just honestly felt like the UK had a much more hands on approach and also made me more interested in the material by being much more relaxed on testing and assignments whereas the amount of pressure and stress from testing and assignments in the US is just overwhelming.

AskReddit,fe5d62f,t1_fe2me8b,1578867926.0,"This is beautiful advice as I just graduated and truly don’t know what to do. I feel like I can finally breathe but I also feel like I have nothing to do with anyone. I want to start my career but don’t know what jobs to apply for. I want to make friends but don’t know how. I am going to try and find new hobbies and go from there now that I actually have some time and hopefully soon, some money!"

orthodontics,fe0ac0v,t1_fdzt83i,1578807620.0,I’ve see the two other orthodontists and they both seem to have way better advice. It just sucks to have to go through the process of paying for braces again.
depression,fdz10rp,t3_en7336,1578785589.0,For me there is just always so much to do all of the time that I get overwhelmed trying to figure out which to prioritize so I just end up not doing anything at all
depression,fdrgqsd,t1_fdquehj,1578684289.0,You truly think I can maintain a relationship without letting him know what my mental state is? He knows how depressed I am. Neither one of us know how to deal with it. It’s easier said than done to “be there for someone”
askwomenadvice,fdqk2fo,t3_emqf5b,1578668572.0,Ditch his ass. You deserve way better. I likely would’ve reacted the same way. It’s easy to just say that you’ll be busy rather than drag you on for hours.
