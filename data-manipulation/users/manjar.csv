TwoXChromosomes,fdprupj,t1_fdprfgz,1578638079.0,"Oh, I agree. I actually find these “he wouldn’t be able to survive without you!” comments really troubling. They support the notion that men legitimately need to be mothered by women. They don’t. They would survive, and if they don’t survive gracefully, that’s on them. And if they want to be more comfortable, then they need to go through the normal process of learning to take care of themselves that human adults are expected to go through. Of course, there are those with actual disabilities that need certain kinds of support. But the idea that men in general need their domestic work done for them is preposterous. Can you imagine if women in general also held this attitude about themselves?"
TwoXChromosomes,fdprb8g,t1_fdp41rf,1578637518.0,"Dumping one’s share of domestic responsibilities onto one’s partner is not clueless. It is extremely selfish and self-serving. Any adult can see this. These same people would never tolerate it if, say, someone at work or a platonic roommate dumped their allotment of shared responsibilities onto them.
