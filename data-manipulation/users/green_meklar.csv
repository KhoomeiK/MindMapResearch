The benefit is that people get to enjoy life more.

Do you enjoy life *because* you're eating food or wearing clothes? Certainly *not* getting to eat food or wear clothes would make your life very miserable.

todayilearned,ffsrlcy,t1_ffnnh4f,1580189950.0,">Why would you expect worker wages to go up?

Because, like I said, each worker would be carrying a larger amount of absolute production power with him to allocate to one company or another. The employers would presumably be willing to pay correspondingly more in order to secure that production power.

If you're an employer, and there's a worker being employed by one of your competitors, and he's being paid way less than his actual labor output, you and he both have an incentive to make a deal where he works for you instead and gets paid a higher wage. Both his revenue and your revenue would go up; only your competitor's revenue would go down. Then, having done this, your competitors finds themselves in the same position, and so on. This effect tends to push wages up to the actual level of labor output.

>You can see where productivity money goes when you look at C level salaries and compare their inflation to that of the average worker's inflation.

I'm aware of where the revenue is *going,* the question here is about where the revenue is *coming from.* What makes you think it's coming from increased labor productivity?

For instance, looking at your first link:

>https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/

>>Data are for compensation (wages and benefits) of production/nonsupervisory workers in the private sector and net productivity of the total economy. “Net productivity” is the growth of output of goods and services less depreciation per hour worked.

It was. It didn't work very well. There are very good reasons why that system of organization didn't last, and why attempts to go back to it have consistently ended in failure.

>I don't think capital was generally shared back then?

That seems to have been the way they did things. They didn't have natural-language writing systems, so we have no written accounts of what they thought their own mode of economic organization was like. But the artifacts and ruins that we can find indicate that they were doing something like that.

You can't really have sharing *without* these rules. If you don't call that 'sharing', that seems like a very narrow conception of 'sharing'.

Well, the idea is that having a large scope of decision-making in one's workplace is something that most workers voluntarily forego as part of their employment contract, in return for a higher wage. It's unreasonable to expect the best of both worlds, because having to incorporate the (possibly bad) decisions of every worker into running the entire production operation poses a genuine risk of making things generally less efficient, as compared to putting those decisions in the hands of dedicated experts. If you imagine trying to *run* a production operation, and what's involved in that, and how you would respond if a worker said they thought it was important that they get to make the sorts of decisions that you specifically hired experts to make, there's obviously a real tradeoff there that won't just magically go away. And at the end of the day, when you present that tradeoff to workers, they almost always choose to receive a higher wage from a more efficient (and reliable) production operation than to take part in the higher-level decision-making for that production operation. That's okay, it's not anti-freedom.

The first person I met mentioned that 'there's been a major terrorist attack in the States', which was the first thing I heard about the event. I didn't have a TV at the time (and of course online video was not really a thing yet), but I heard enough over the radio to understand that terrorists had hijacked several airliners simultaneously, and crashed two of them into the World Trade Center towers in New York City as a suicide attack, knocking them down. At first it was ambiguous how many airliners had actually been hijacked, because pretty much any airliner deviating at all from its original flight plan was considered a possible threat, and I recall the number eight being thrown around as a rough upper bound. Around late morning and early afternoon I was out with some friends playing softball at a field near their home, there was some discussion of the morning events but mostly we just concentrated on the game. Afterwards we all went back to their place to watch the news on their big flatscreen TV (a more uncommon piece of equipment back in 2001 than it is now), where I first saw actual images and video of what had happened. Every single channel was turned to coverage of the event, all the ads and other news stories were pretty much canceled wholesale throughout the day. (Even several days later, the story was still dominating most of the news channels' broadcast time, and other stories would get maybe a few minutes of half-hearted coverage before the broadcast turned back to 9/11.) The towers had already been down for several hours at that point, but the TV broadcasts kept replaying footage from the morning, cut in with news announcers talking about the event, and some up-to-date footage of the still-smoking New York skyline and the damage to the Pentagon. We did get to watch the collapse of Building 7 in close to real time. By the end of the day it seemed to be commonly understood that there were either four or five hijacked airliners. I'm not sure where the five figure came from, I think there may have been an unrelated crash the same morning which was initially lumped in with the attacks. On that day, I think everyone just referred to the event as 'the attack', and I forget when I first started hearing it referred to as 'the September 11 attack' or '9/11'. I knew the choice of '9/11' was brilliant as soon as I heard it, because the 911 telephone number was already conceptually linked to emergencies, disasters, high tension, etc, which mirrored the sense of shock, vulnerability and morbid fascination that everyone was feeling on that day. At first there was little public knowledge about who had performed the attacks or why, and I remember somebody saying on that day that 'Al-Qaida say they didn't do it, but they support whoever did' (which was the first time I remember hearing about Al-Qaida in any context). It took at least some days or weeks before the eyes of the world became focused on Al-Qaida as the instigators of the 9/11 attacks and the prime villains of the era.

At the time, I understood that the attack was a significant event and would feature prominently in the history books, but I didn't foresee just how much it would impact the public consciousness and the course of international relations in the following decade. Perhaps not on that day, but soon afterwards, I remember an older person saying that 9/11 would be the defining event for Generation Y and their cultural era, in the same sense that the Kennedy assassination was considered the defining event for the boomers and *their* cultural era. This definitely played out more strongly and deeply than I anticipated. I remember hearing George Bush and other prominent public figures declaring that 'the terrorists shall not break our spirit' and 'if we let ourselves fear them, they win', but within a few years it was obvious that the terrorists *had* won, that the fear *was* real and the course of history was bending accordingly. Obviously by now we've had an entire generation growing up since 9/11 and we can see its stain gradually extending across history, even as new cultural shifts come along (such as post-2008 economic anxiety and the rise of Donald Trump) and blend together with it, taking society in new directions. What is clear is that the innocence and optimism of the 1990s has never really recovered.

For me personally, it did somewhat change my outlook on humanity. At the time, I linked the concept of suicide attacks (especially those carried out with airplanes) primarily with the japanese kamikaze tactics of World War 2. And although I found even that idea horrifying, the context there was very different, a question of a military force adopting a specific desperate technique against another military force, *knowing* that soldiers' lives were going to be sacrificed anyway and choosing to do it in a manner that might increase their effectiveness. Moreover, it was something confined to history, not really a part of the modern world. I do remember having read in a newspaper at least one story of a muslim suicide bomber blowing up a bus in Israel, which I also found deeply disturbing, but I thought that was kind of a one-off event that only crazy people would do. 9/11 was different, a large-scale, modern-day suicide attack deliberately carried out on civilians, outside a military context, by people who must have planned their own deaths for months in advance and even trained as pilots anticipating that their final act would be to fly an airplane into the side of an office building. The notion of people in modern times being able to think those thoughts and make those decisions was sickening, but also eye-opening, expanding my view of the variety of beliefs and mindsets people have, and the horrors that are possible once people are convinced that they are instruments of God's will."

This doesn't make sense. If labor productivity were up, we would expect wages to be up as well, because a worker would be taking a larger chunk of production with them when they move companies and the companies would want to secure this for themselves by making better offers.

Labor productivity? Oh, quite a lot.

Remember, productivity is something that applies to both labor and land. Concentrating workers in smaller spaces decreases labor productivity, but increases land productivity. Ideally, you want to balance out the density of workers at the point where adding more workers would cause labor productivity to decrease faster than land productivity increases, but taking away workers would cause land productivity to decrease faster than labor productivity increases.

Of course, there's only so much land in the world, whereas the quantity of workers is constantly going up. Therefore, this 'balance point' is gradually shifting in the direction of higher worker density over time. In the future, land productivity will be very high and labor productivity will be very low, and so maximizing the efficiency with which land is used will be extremely important and maximizing the efficiency with which labor is used will be of virtually no importance."

Contrary to all the (wrong) economics you've probably learned throughout your life, maximizing worker productivity is not actually all that important to companies. The open-plan offices achieve two other goals which are much more important. First, they maximize the productivity of *land,* by cramming more workers onto the same floor area. In a world where the economy is shifting from being labor-dominated to being land-dominated, this is a more effective way for the company to save costs.

No, it doesn't. You weren't going to earn more there anyway. All you could do there is capture more *unearned* revenue from the natural world. That's what landowners do, they don't earn, they capture. (At least in their capacity as landowners.)

>Therefore, why would anyone bother to do business in the best location possible if they won’t earn more for it?

Because it's better than the other available locations.

Don't forget: The thing about 'earning more' refers to generally collecting a higher rate of wages/profit from one's investments of labor/capital. In general, labor and capital are mobile enough that the rate of return on each tends to be about the same between high-value and low-value land. However, this does not apply to *specific business sectors.* 100% LVT does not imply that a cabbage farm will be just as lucrative in the middle of Manhattan as it will in the middle of Wyoming, or that a movie theater is just as financially sustainable in the mongolian grassland as it is in the middle of Tokyo. Some businesses (like movie theaters) need high density, while others (like cabbage farms) can't afford high density. People don't run movie theaters in the city in order to capture more rent, they do it because that's the only place where labor and capital can be efficiently used for that particular sort of business; and at the same time, the reason cabbage farmers live in rural areas isn't that they are somehow capturing more rent there, it's that their particular skills are not useful anywhere else."

It doesn't.

>If no, then how does that person ""climb the ladder?""

Maybe they don't.

First, the idea here is not some sort of social-mobility priority where we need to give everybody a chance to become a billionaire. The idea is just to keep people from descending into economic destitution. The insurance would not come with the statistical expectation that anyone with a terrible disability *would* have become a billionaire in the absence of that disability. Obviously that's not realistic or reasonable.

Second, there are limits to what could be justified even under the insurance. Some people are born with genetic disorders so disastrous that it's infeasible or unreasonable to even try to keep them alive. We don't want to end up in a situation where a large proportion of our civilization's effort and resources are being put towards incredibly expensive infrastructure for maintaining the lives of a very small proportion of people.

I don't see how you figure that. If they're spending less, they'll tend to compete with each other, pushing prices down, so that they also end up taking in less.

If the planning system is that efficient, then people in a free market would voluntarily choose to hire the planning system to advise them on their economic decisions.
