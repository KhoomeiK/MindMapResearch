getdisciplined,fgjkmoc,t1_fgig0b4,1580845993.0,"Something that created a change for me was loving-kindness meditations. If you search this term on YouTube you will likely find several options. I know there is a dedicated loving-kindness meditation on the Calm App as well. This may also sound ""butterflies and rainbows"" as OP termed, but that's not my experience. It's a practice of feeling those positive emotions for others and perhaps more importantly; ourselves. (and who wouldn't want that!) The change and learning comes through continual practice so I try to focus on this type of intent as often as I can. It has certainly made a difference in my life."
getdisciplined,fgj044r,t1_fgiwtbv,1580834438.0,"Oh! That's a great differentiation! That really helps clear things up for me.

This is what I *feel* (attitude) when I am expressing compassion although from the outside it doesn't *look* (action) like I am doing anything differently. That's brilliant.

Thanks a lot for this post. Do you have any additional resources (books, podcasts, etc) you would recommend on this topic?"
getdisciplined,fgivs5h,t1_fgiq4hv,1580831976.0,"I wonder if people have different interpretations of the definition of compassion?

I had a similar discussion through another forum about this exact topic. Those opposed seemed to think I was advocating they let others walk all over them; they shouldn't speak up and voice their opinion or stand for what's right; they should just side with what their opposers say - but that's not the sentiment at all. It seems some assume compassion is a form of weakness, although it is actually a strength. The same can be said for concepts like vulnerability, surrender and acceptance. It's as if these words have a cultural meaning that isn't representative of their proper definition given further understanding and context."
videography,fgfu383,t1_fge3m74,1580747631.0,"I think you nailed it. We've all probably had those text conversations where you perceive someone being snarky or short with you; I have several friends this way. In person, they're pleasant and communicate just fine.

Spoken language is separate from written language in the context of social growth. Think of the outgoing party person who struggles writing and conversely the lonely shy type who can convey great emotion with their words in the form of books and poems.

Honing each skill requires introspection and contextual social evaluation. I just don't believe some people have been introduced to this perspective or practice it. This isn't due to stupidity by an means; I would argue most societies don't promote these values. That and social skills are often thought to be inherent to an individual, as if they were heredity. They are a skill - meaning they can be learned and cultivated over time; no different from playing the guitar or gaining confidence."
veganfitness,fgfqri5,t1_fgff26v,1580745489.0,"May I reiterate your point to see if I understand?

The concern is that Clean Label Project *may* be fudging some data in order to create a ""need"" for a product to be evaluated to ensure it doesn't contain ""harmful ingredients"" using scare tactics. Then they profit off selling their logo, i.e. ""certification"" to companies that wan't to prove they have ""clean"" products so they don't lose sales due to the scare tactics they generated in the first place?

That could be a legitimate need, but the skepticism stems from the company not publishing their data, therefor not allowing any outside eyes to review and confirm if their findings are credible?"
getdisciplined,fehbhzk,t3_ep0q9u,1579113142.0,"I find that audio books are a great practice of focused awareness. Bonus points if you're listening to books about mindfulness ;).

Sit in a meditative type posture, chair or otherwise (alert, straight back, head unsupported so you don't fall asleep), close your eyes, throw in your headphones and just listen. The material should ideally be engaging enough that it draws your full attention while at the same time you are eliminating the sights and sounds of the outside world. I just did this for 30 minutes this last night, about an hour before bed. I also focused on a mindful practice similar to what you've suggested and I woke up more refreshed and alert than I've been in weeks!"
Woodworkingplans,fedo9n8,t1_fec11v6,1579016293.0,Haha. I certainly agree with you but it sounds like that's OP's only option :(
3Dprinting,feb0my5,t1_fddml4p,1578954245.0,"I'm have similar issues, but not nearly as bad as OP. I did notice that the screws holding the arms to the extruder had loosened. I first saw this mentioned in this video - [https://youtu.be/Td8ErHFV1QM?t=64](https://youtu.be/Td8ErHFV1QM?t=64)

Once I tightened those it improved but still far from perfect. Please let me know if you find any resolution and I will do the same :)"
drawing,fear9dg,t3_eo953z,1578951519.0,"That's kind of my experience! I used to love drawing as a kid. I mean, it was my *thing*. I fell out of it around high school and never really picked it back up; although I have ventured into other forms of creativity over the years. What got you back in?"
Woodworkingplans,fealqcb,t1_feahzc2,1578950161.0,"Here's how I would do it with a 4x4 from Home Depot -

1. Find the straightest, highest quality (without knots, dents, sap, etc) 4x4 you can find.
2. Use the miter saw to cut rough cubes from the 4x4. It doesn't have to be perfect at this point. You wouldn't want to run a full 4x4 through your table saw because it's heavy, difficult to control and is highly unlikely to be perfectly straight so these all risk you putting pressure between the blade and the fence (i.e. kickback).
3. Set the ""cube"" in-between the fence and the blade of your table saw. Remove the wood cube and tap the fence in about 1/16th - 1/8th of an inch, just enough to remove the round edge. Less is more here and multiple passes would be cleaner and safer. Raise the blade about half way (\~2 in) and pass the block through once. This will leave an ""overhang"" of wood on the top above the blade. Flip it over to make another pass to remove this ""overhang"" of wood.
4. Tap the fence in again and remove the other parallel sides rounded edge using the same technique -  your freshly cut side should now be up against the fence. After you finish this second side, keep the fence distance where it is for the next step.
5. Turn the block 90 degrees. Again, run the block through against the fence, flip it over and run it though, again removing the overhang. You should now have a cube. It may require some sanding to remove any left-over saw marks.

I found this more difficult than expected to describe haha, hopefully that made sense!"
Woodworkingplans,feago0z,t3_eoa10d,1578948557.0,"You could run a 4x4 through either a planer, a jointer or even a table saw to square them up! Then it would be a matter of creating the cubes with a miter saw or a crosscut sled on your table saw."
Ayurveda,fe8ucc5,t3_eny3ag,1578931018.0,Thanks so much being brave and openly talking about these issues. Please continue to share your journey as I am sure it can help so many other people. I wish you health and happiness!
selfimprovement,fby865p,t1_fby0do6,1577210433.0,"Don't sweat it, I'd wouldn't want to see your positive energy wasted on these types of attitudes. Based on their post history they're (likely) either a troll or a very angry and sad person. I find it best to send them best intentions and ignore them :\\"
