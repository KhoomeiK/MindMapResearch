You’re saying ‘oh but they have to spend money on rebuilding’ that’s like a worst case scenario for them, if they have a choice they’ll want to stay in the place they’ve grown up with their communities around them, especially since going and finding a completely new place to live and get a whole new profession.
You sound very out of touch here, I’d advise you to actually do some research into the people you’re actively condemning."
unpopularopinion,ffpgymg,t1_ffjsk83,1580094795.0,It’s a pretty funny unpopular opinion on a sub literally for that. How about you stop being a bitter sorts fan and move on.
unpopularopinion,ffpggxh,t3_euhoke,1580094450.0,"And what exactly is wrong with not settling? Sorry you’re tired at age fucking 19 but most people want a relationship that’ll actually continue being fullfilling.
Also, the reason the divorce rate is so high is because of marrying young and/or leaving abusive relationships, so..."
unpopularopinion,ffpfkq2,t3_euay6s,1580093817.0,"I disagree entirely...
You’re entire argument is based on the fact that having a lot of sex is ‘immoral’ somehow, because you’re using someone else’s body... 
but the whole point is it’s consensual? At the end of the day, it’s just 2 people (or more if that’s your thing) having a good time together. Why is that such an awful thing? I think you need to properly think about why two consenting adults enjoying an activity together makes you so mad honestly. 
And ‘especially women?’ Seriously?? You realise women can enjoy sex, and it doesnt make them bad people, and to somehow think women who sleep around as much as men are somehow worse is SUCH a double standard and is honestly really gross."
unpopularopinion,ffpf3af,t3_eug5rx,1580093467.0,"Well here’s my opinion on this:
I’m an atheist. I believe that life, and more specifically human consciousness, is just a happy accident. It doesn’t have any inherent meaning to it, it just is a thing that exists in this weird-ass universe. 
So you could make the argument you’re making, if there’s no big reward at the end for being a good person, why bother?
Well, I’d argue it’s because we should value the lives we have. Yeah our time on Earth is short, but really that should make it worth MORE, not less. Why spend you’re time being a selfish assholes, bring negatives into other people’s very short times alive, when you could actually enjoy it, and bring joy to others as well. You aren’t gonna do that by committing crimes and hurting people. That’s just going to make you and happy and whoops life is over and you pretty much wasted it. 
Yeah, being good and kind doesn’t get you some amazing heaven. An eternal afterlife of bliss and happiness. But as an atheist I try to uphold those ideals anyway because I just cannot justify wasting something as weird and crazy and amazing as consciousness just being cruel and uncaring. Yeah life doesn’t have any inherent meaning, or point, but the point is you’re supposed to go and make one!
Sorry, I hope that made sense this post just made me think quite a bit so this all came out a bit stream-of-consciousness esque. This is something I think about quite a lot."
unpopularopinion,ffpd9pk,t1_ffp6iet,1580092158.0,"I mean... it’s actually less hygienic to shave it, the hair is there for a reason, it protects the genitalia from infection so...
I’m not really agreeing or disagreeing with the main post, just saying the myth that it’s more hygienic to shave is pretty fake."
unpopularopinion,ff8z29m,t3_es5f89,1579700580.0,"I’m sorry, I just feel this is one of the most gross and entitled things I’ve ever read lmao. I guess that makes it unpopular?"
agedlikemilk,femsjzm,t3_dzzjjl,1579268392.0,"It’s so wild, I was born in 2001 and somehow never heard of the time when everyone thought the computers were all gonna die until a few weeks ago at New Years. I was just asking my dad about how cool it must have been to celebrate the millennium, and he mentioned how (at least with the people he was with) it was kinda overshadowed by people terrified about Y2K. And apparently the actual one could happen in 2038 or something according to him so that’s fun. Still don’t really know what it is, something about computers counting time I think."
todayilearned,felp7jf,t3_eppa70,1579227576.0,"This is a brilliant idea. I honestly don’t know what to say to those who ‘opt out’ of organ donation. Like, it’s one thing if you aren’t really made aware of how you can opt in. It’s another thing making the express choice to not donate organs after death. I just... I can’t with you people. Have you not a shred of empathy for other people in your body?? The amount of bullshit I’m seeing on this thread is honestly painful. 
To everyone saying touting conspiracy theories about the government stealing your organs, whining about body ownership or giving the whole medicine neutrality argument (ignoring the fact that every time they get an organ they have to do a whole cost benefit analysis to decide which patient deserves the organ the most anyway. The 20 year old alcoholic? The 60 year old marathon runner? The 3 year old with a terminal illness?) and I’m just like... 
there are so many people out there who’s life would be forever changed by this. Maybe they’ve been on dialysis for years, have an illness that’s ruined their life, or just got into an accident. But doing this one thing would be giving them a fucking miracle. It would probably be the best thing a lot of people do with their lives, donating the organ and helping someone. 
And it’s so fucking EASY. It requires literally no sacrifice! You’re DEAD for fucks sake! And people still opt out! So don’t tell me I’m not allowed to be so very fucking angry at these people, that actively choose to have their legacy be them being selfish assholes. 
So yeah. They should go to the bottom of the list. Fuck it, they shouldn’t even be on the list. You don’t wanna donate, right back at you motherfucker."
todayilearned,feln9d8,t1_felkw8s,1579226240.0,But you’re... dead? You can’t feel pain? What are you on...
todayilearned,feln5v1,t1_felih4i,1579226173.0,"Lol you miss that the whole process of organ donation is deciding who needs help. They get an organ and then have a choice to make over who deserves it. May as well put this policy into the mix as well, only receive if you’re willing to give."
todayilearned,felmqjh,t1_felcfcl,1579225882.0,"Well yeah but then you just have to think of the thousands of people with a disease of an organ that’s ruining their lives, whose life would be saved by getting your kidney/heart/lung/liver, most people who want organs aren’t super wealthy billionaires, just ordinary people who want their lives back. Imo it’s incredibly selfish to not be an organ donor."
