edit 2: Damn I'm dumb, in Europe we use 220 standard and 400 volt for heavier work.  So my comparison may be off. I know that 400 welds better than 220 with heavier work.

Maybe try to make a portfolio of your welds or school welding projects. And apply directly to companies as much as possible, this because recruitment agencies  often have no idea about the actual work and aren't necessarily capable of judging you potential.

One persons  needs this amount to sustain itself.... every resource beyond that..... how the hell does this need explanation. And no, I do not think the absolute minimum is necessary for sustainability  . I believe it all depends on a simple equation:  


Planet capacity  **÷**  population + prosperity level = max population for stability. How in the fuck is this hard to understand?"

What still bothers me is that next year we will have the same thing, Droughts around the world, Hurricanes smashing into coasts, monsoons drowning Asia, and yet humanity as an entity will continue on it's current path.   


It's a huge shame that the good of the individual cannot become the good of the group.  Hope I'm proven wrong in the next twenty years."
todayilearned,fde65wa,t1_fde1j0w,1578332037.0,"You completely missed my premise. We shouldn't relinquish our excess wealth and prosperity FOR African people. It's about stabilizing levels of world wide consumption to prevent future shortages (to the best of our abilities. If we as a species want ourselves and our progeny to have any semblance of the prosperity we enjoy now (in the west) we all have to either sacrifice excess wealth now, or reduce the world population very quickly.    


What I'm saying is that every person on this earth shares responsibility for the trajectory of human existence. I believe it is very clear that our current trajectory leads to disaster for all. And that the west is a major contributor to this.  


The position of vhemt would be, either we peacefully reduce population or it will come through the structures we have created in this world, violently. I am not a member of vhemt, purely because I don't think the universe would be better without people (and many vhemt members truly believe this although definitely not all), But I do see it as a tool to make people think about population and consumption.   


I like how I misunderstand economics in your view, all the while our economic systems completely ignore earth system science for short term financial gain and stability. We will all feel the pain of our collective overconfidence in the future, that's assuming you are not in eg. Australia at the moment and  feeling it now.  


tl;dr: It's not what others have now, but what we all may have in the future."

And it's worth mentioning that when considering resources used an american uses equal to 10(+ a little) Africans and a European for about 6. so 10.000 less Americans born is equal to 100.000 less Afrikaans born. The true solution is relinquishing excess wealth and prosperity and to settle for less now so our future holds more."

The private sector funds only that research which may give them gains (generally). This also leads to a lat least some research being skewed to seem more useful than it is, simply to maintain bonds with commercial sources of said funds.  


I was (and still am) a huge proponent of furthering science, but the more I talk with friends who are active in the research world, the more I see how the trajectory of the scientific community is forced into directions that worry me. I believe that commercial funding of science is something to avoid whenever possible, but with budget cuts in governmental scientific funds it seems that many institutions are forced towards it."
