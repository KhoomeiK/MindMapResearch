demisexuality,ffk2cd1,t3_et6tpv,1580013654.0,I've dated and been with people ive had absolutely no sexual attraction for. out of the ones i have been with only 3 did i actually really find myself sexually attracted to. From now im probably only going to date people i have these feelings for because its a lot of people that have shown interest in me. But im not interested in any of them at all. .. Im barely interested in people. I wish there was someone other than my past partner i had feelings for...... lol...
Asexual,ffii037,t3_es6gm9,1579974331.0,Hi this is unrelated but you kind of helped me kind of figure out how to describe myself to others because I can relate to some of what you said in your post.
FondantHate,fekhmfi,t1_fekfxar,1579200221.0,i'd like to know as well.
SuicideWatch,fejxyv7,t1_fejo29a,1579188400.0,"I feel this way too, I've been trying to tell myself that its worth it to stay alive to try to do this. Or do that. But I hate my family. I hate my life and I would rather be dead. But if I commit to it I want a method that would end it all for sure. I dont want to be hospitalized or something of the like."
SuicideWatch,fcyaikp,t3_ejjdgq,1578077156.0,"I relate too much to this because I honestly felt that way too, hell i still feel that way honestly. I recently graduated college and realized now I have to work to support myself and get by and live. And its not like i wasnt working before or anything. But just working my life away to pay student loans and keep a roof over my head sounds like it sucks. I dont think i was prepared for that. I didnt have any job offers after i graduated. And I didnt have any passions or anything i wanted to do before coming to college either. So i definitely can understand your struggle. I know you said you have a year left so best of luck to you with the remainder of your year. I hope it treats you well. And its ok to be scared, college is scary as hell. So is life. I just hope you're able to make the best decision for you, whatever that may be."
SuicideWatch,fcsnqz9,t3_eipdrl,1577920592.0,I ask myself the same everyday.
SuicideWatch,fcsafn2,t1_fcs7yu6,1577913773.0,"i appreciate that you can relate and its ok that youre unsure about how to talk to people who deal with feelings similar to mine. im really just posting how i feel on reddit cause its one of the few places where its really safe for me to. like when ive brought it up irl with friends or others theyd try to use religion or like other people to make me feel guilty about it. and ive always kind of hated that. like if you want just give them my things, hell ill give them my things. i know other people are suffering and if i can donate them money and things to help, i will/would. but ive hated the notion that like people use that to make you feel bad about how you feel. like your feelings are invalidated or something. or that you shouldnt feel this way because x person is going through x thing and theyre not feeling the same way as you, so you shouldnt feel how you feel. its been done so often and i hate it."
SuicideWatch,fcryefu,t1_fcrwwep,1577908332.0,"I appreciate that, thank you. I'll PM you if thats ok."
SuicideWatch,fcqvcbv,t3_eijac9,1577892763.0,"I can relate to how you feel for most of these things. I kind of get what you mean. Like i get the whole family friends would miss you, but like you said i kind of want them to. I feel like i dont matter now, so id matter more in death. When my mom passed a lot of people who didnt talk to her when she was alive came to her funeral. And she received like way more support than she ever had when she was alive."
SuicideWatch,fam8gka,t1_fam8b1o,1576198095.0,"yes please, i'd love to talk."
