nfl,feiwtun,t1_feivjdg,1579149387.0,"Well Maddow isn't really the star of the show in this clip, that would be Lev Parnas claiming Trump, pence, barr, nunes, and more all knew everything about the bribery to get Biden's name smeared to help trump win the election, and that he's willing to testify to that in front of congress. Which is pretty huge news and very damaging to the (false) narrative the trump camp has been spinning around these events.  

with regards to iran, the reason I dislike trump's actions here are because he doesn't and can't justify what he did. The justifications his people give seem false. There was an 'imminent' threat, but they don't know where, or when? That doesn't sound imminent. And if there *was* an imminent threat, that means they didn't notify any of those embassies, which is exactly what they accused hillary of doing in benghazi, by-the-by. 

Can killing a man such as Soleimani reduce terrorism? Yes, probably. Can taking action such as we did *increase* terrorism? Also yes. The whole thing just smacks of a president posturing to draw attention away from his impeachment, and potentially starting a war is just not worth that. 

In my opinion, Trump has mishandled Iran severely. We had a nuclear treaty, with inspectors to keep an eye on things. Now we have nothing--no assurance the Iranians aren't making nukes. And that's just what they need--we don't unilaterally assassinate the top men of countries with nukes. And all that treaty was costing us was some money that the US owed Iran anyway, for weapons we sold to them and never delivered. 

Do I think the Iranian people deserve better than the theocracy they suffer under? Absolutely. Do I think it's worth doing another middle eastern war because Trump knows he's fucked on this impeachment thing? Hell no. We need to be more careful when considering big moves like *assassinating* people. And from what I understand, when the generals presented trump with a list of options for responding to the death of that contractor, they didn't expect trump to pick this assassination because it was too extreme, and included it on the list in order to make the other options appear more reasonable.  And now that choice got all those people on that jet liner killed. Let's hope that's where it stops."
