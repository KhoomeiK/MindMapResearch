In “Daughter of Autolycus” (Series 4) it’s the summer of 1953 (the Pelagius cross is a gift to Queen Elizabeth II for her coronation).

Since then there have been two Christmas specials which should push series 6 into 1955.

HOWEVER, in “The Two Deaths of Hercule Flambeau” (the series 6 finale) the date is June 1953.

EDIT: “The Queen Bee” (Series 8 Episode 2) is set at the end of June 1953. Which would effectively render the entirety of series 7 to occur within the span of less than 3 weeks, which is incredibly unlikely. “The Scales of Justice” (Series 8 Episode 3) takes place in July & September 1953."
