AskTrumpSupporters,fft3y42,t1_ffq23i9,1580205809.0,"The only people in the tax cut bill that had a tax increase were people in the highest bracket.

The tax cut included all sorts of compromises with the leftists to raise some taxes, remove deductions.  The result of even the watered down tax cut was an increase, not decrease, in federal revenue.

Increased revenue does not cause a deficit.  

Even pretending your claim is true - tax cuts result in lower revenue - doesn't lead to tax cuts caused higher deficits. Spending creates deficits.

Gotta love how you try to blame spending on Trump.  ""We'll cut spending later"" - he said that because Congress would not cut spending.  GEOTUS saved that fight for later.  That doesn't change the fact that he wants to cut spending and tried multiple times to cut spending.

Leftists spend more and more, shriek whenever spending cuts are proposed, shriek that we shouldn't cut spending, then try to blame deficits on the people who want to and tried to cut spending or on tax cuts that increased revenue.

""“Page, who had previously been an informant and witness for the United States in a federal espionage case against a Russian intelligence official, was targeted by the Obama FBI as a Russian spy helping Putin to steal the election from Hillary Clinton in 2016,” The Federalist reported. “According to the IG report, before the FBI and DOJ went to the FISA Court to apply for a warrant to spy on Page, an unnamed U.S. intelligence agency had told the FBI that Carter Page had previously assisted that agency’s efforts against Russian spies. Although exculpatory information about potential spy targets is required in spy warrant applications, Obama’s FBI and DOJ deliberately withheld that information from the spy court in order to paint Page in the worst possible light.”""

""“Ahead of an application to renew the spy warrant in 2017, a top FBI lawyer doctored evidence from the unnamed agency which confirmed that contrary to FBI claims that he was a Russian spy, Page had in fact assisted the United States in its efforts to counter Russian operations,” The Federalist added. “An e-mail from the agency that clearly stated Page was ‘a source’ for them was doctored by Kevin Clinesmith, a top FBI national security lawyer, to give the opposite impression to the federal spy court.”""

He was the mastermind behind the Benghazi attack.  He supplied and trained and created the strategies/tactics for terrorists in Iraq who were responsible for 600+ U.S. soldiers and thousands of Iraqi citizens killed.

According to federal court documents, Arbabsiar traveled repeatedly to Tehran to meet with an associate of Soleimani’s to receive orders and money and ultimately recruited a Mexican drug dealer to carry out the barbarous plot the Iranians proposed: to kill al-Jubeir while he was lunching at the upscale restaurant at the Watergate Hotel.

If successful, the bombing could have killed more than a hundred people in the heart of the US capitol, but Soleimani reportedly wasn’t worried about the collateral damage. As I wrote at the time, the only reason the plot failed was very good luck (as far as the FBI was concerned). Arbabsiar chose the wrong Mexican to carry out the hit, one who happened to be an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

In recent years, Soleimani has traveled repeatedly to Syria to supervise the construction of a network of military and intelligence bases Iran planned to use to expand its presence on Israel’s borders. Israeli fighter jets reportedly narrowly missed him during a 2015 strike on an Iranian base in Aleppo province. Shortly after that attack, he told an Iranian Internet news service, “Martyrdom is what I seek in mountains and valleys but isn’t granted yet.”"

"" As Paul Homewood [pointed](https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2019/12/24/are-australian-wildfires-due-to-climate-change/) out last month, there has been no significant long-term decrease in rainfall or increase in temperatures in the affected regions.  Yes, it has been dry in New South Wales (where most of the worst fires are), but there have been several years, especially pre-1960, when it was drier:""  


"" The same applies to temperature. Yes, this has been a hot spring in New South Wales. But there have been times when it has been much hotter — making a nonsense of all stories in the Australian media about temperatures being the hottest evah: ""  


"" So, to be clear, there is zero evidence of any change in climatic conditions that might have increased the likelihood or severity of these bush fires. This is not — repeat **NOT** — a man-made climate change story, and anyone who claims otherwise is either a gullible idiot or a lying charlatan. ""

""There is, nonetheless, good reason to believe that the stupidity and irresponsibility of man is at least partly to blame for this disaster — just not quite in the way that the left-liberal MSM and the green wankerati would have you believe.""

""**Man-made culprit #1**: all the firebugs who have been deliberately starting fires in New South Wales, Queensland, and elsewhere. You won’t be surprised that their involvement has had very little coverage in the left-liberal MSM.""    


Did you know people are starting fires there?  ""*Figures obtained by AAP reveal 98 people – 31 adults and 67 juveniles – have been dealt with by Queensland police for deliberately setting fires.""*

&#x200B;

*""* **Man-made culprit #2:** well-meaning idiots who don’t understand that unless you manage forested areas with controlled burns, you’re going to end up with out-of-control wildfires. ""    


Did you know controlled burns have been stopped by activists and environmentalists?  Some of the activists think the controlled burns contribute to climate change.  


Are you aware leftist climate change zealots in the Australian government have been passing legislation that stops controlled burns, removes dams which makes it harder to get water to fight fires - causing them to spread; stops road maintenance which makes it harder to move around to fight the fires; made it illegal to cut down trees, which is a key tactic in stopping the spread of wild fires?  


"" **Liam Sheahan is an Australian fireman who in 2002 was fined $50,000 – and paid another $50,000 in costs – for illegally clearing the trees round his home in rural Victoria. In 2009 he was vindicated when his property was only one left standing after bushfires destroyed his town.** ""  


"" **And let’s just repeat one more time:** Australia’s bush fires have nothing whatsoever to do with climate change. There is no evidence at all to support this claim; it is clearly contradicted by the temperature and rainfall record. The people who claim otherwise, especially those trying to make political capital out of the disaster by twisting the facts to suit their narrative, are either offensively ignorant or nauseatingly unconscionable. In my next article — because why not? This is the year when I get Medieval on the greenies’ collective arse — I shall name a few names. """
