photography,fed9btb,t1_feaq4rp,1579004503.0,"It depends entirely on what your goal is. For me, the goal is to produce an aesthetically pleasing picture, not to represent reality. The digital representation of the light captured from a scene onto a camera sensor is one of the raw materials I use to produce that picture, in that regard it's no different than the paint used by a painter. Photoshop is then used as a tool to create the final picture using the raw material, like a painter uses a brush to apply paint to the canvas and transform it into an image.

> They walk past it every day etc. And therefore they care about the accuracy of the photo

Even if you intend to document a place or moment, a photo does not represent the reality of it, it cannot do that. A photo is flat, a camera sensor is not an eye, the camera doesn't capture the sound, the smell, the chill of the wind on a cold day, the thickness of the air on a hot humid day, etc.  

At best, a photo is a rendition of the photographers impression of that moment. You can change the colours to be warmer in order to represent the hot pressing humidity of that moment, or cool them down if it was a cold day. Maybe it was a bright sunny day, but due to whatever events happened that day there was a sad, depressed mood and you change the color grading to reflect that. 

My point is: even if you're set out to document reality, a 'fake' picture with changed colours may do a better job of that than just the plain unmodified image from the camera. A clinical image doesn't necessarily capture how the photographer experienced that moment."

I guess it's for the same reason you don't have electric kettles: the fact you use 110v instead of 230v. The lower voltage makes it impractical to use devices that use a lot of power because the current would be too high. Deep fryers use similar amounts of power as electric kettles (usually 2000-3000 watt) and both would require a custom outlet in a typical US home.
