Fitness,ffurisu,t3_euwh9f,1580247973.0,"Unfortunately, the benefits of exercise do not get banked like how your extra calories can be deposited as fat to be used later on when you need it. If you work out heavily like twice a week, very hard, but am sedentary most of the other days, then it’s not great for you. Evidence of this is supported by studies into exercise and type 2 diabetes development. Moving throughout the day appears to have benefits to health. It doesn’t mean you have to be working out, but being in motion, activating your muscles in any way seems to be beneficial."

That killed 37,000 people and 21 million were infected. Now, let’s say this coronavirus is allowed to run amok and it now infects the same exact number of people, 21 million. If the mortality rate stays about the same and let’s say it ends up being 3.4%, the number of deaths would be 740,000. Now let’s say this scales similarly to China, a population about 4x the population of the US. That would be about 2.9 million dead per year. Can you imagine a major US city worth of people getting wiped out per year by a cold virus? That’s what an uncontrolled novel coronavirus implies and why it’s important to freak out about. SARS was bad at a mortality rate of 9.5% and MERS was  at 34.4%. Imagine the death toll from those if it was uncontrolled."

science,ffjalwf,t1_ffj4f67,1579994299.0,"To be fair China did much of the innovation early on in history and were leaps and bounds ahead of the west. It is just that recently, WWII and post WWII, America was the one to leap forward. Now we understand the framework of the culture that has lead and continues to lead innovation but it’s not exclusive to America. It can be learned and is currently being taught through books, classes and is widely spread information. Once that is adopted by China, combined with their doggedness and hard work it’s possible they will surge back to become the dominant empire.

I feel that the reddit attitude to China is that of arrogance. “Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is.” The arrogant European nations were once the dominant players and colonized the world. Now they are so much weaker or non existent like the Ottoman Empire. As the west is mired with infighting amongst itself, China is pressing forward, united in their cause for progress. It was argued that once people are more educated and rich, they’ll want a democracy and authoritarian regimes cannot last. China is proving that theory wrong especially in the case of the internet. Look how much weaker America is now with social media. Will the democracy experiment last? What a time to be alive."

No radio telescope with infinite power would be able to distinguish signal from noise because such a transmission is too weak. The point with dark forest theory is that with near infinite time, some civilization should have been able to develop an ability to communicate intergalactically through advanced technologies. If a civilization advanced as quickly on a trajectory like ours which appears to be logarithmic, it is unimaginable what would be achieved in millions or billions of years. If that is the case, then it is not unreasonable to think that they do not want to be found because once you’ve reached that point of technology, you will also realize how easy it is to be overwhelmed and sniffed out by a bigger badder civilization."

Also, even if you were capable of sending a strong enough signal, you would only know the direction of where the signal came from but not how far. To know the location, you will need a signal and response. Civilizations that haphazardly send and respond to signals get wiped out.

So what would it take for humanity to focus all of our resources for a common goal of intergalactic survival? The death of the planet.

Velo,felkh4p,t3_epjfkb,1579224340.0,"I would base your decision on what tires you plan on running. 28mm tires balloon up to 30-32mm depending on what internal rim width. 26mm balloons up to 28-30mm. You'll want to stick to the general rule of 105 and base your rim width decisions on that. If you want to run 28mm tires, I recommend something like the [All Road 50](https://novemberbicycles.com/collections/all-road-disc-wheels/products/all-road-50-disc-white-industries-shimano-sram-drive). It's what I run on the allez sprint disc. That particular offering is a light bicycle falcon pro 50 rim and the carbon layup process leaves a super sexy finish.

If you are looking to achieve 28-30mm true tire width, the CL50s are a great choice. You're paying a bit for the roval brand though. You can achieve the same performance with handbuilt wheels for cheaper.
