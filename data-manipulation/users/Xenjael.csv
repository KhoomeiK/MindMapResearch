Philippines,ffiws7m,t1_ffhi38h,1579984606.0,But couldn't you open the business in another country and then sell to filipino customer base? I feel like you can get through that red tape over time depending how you approach it rather than all at once.

Philippines,ffiwkyl,t3_etldp5,1579984460.0,"Im a western entrepreneur and do AI dev, have already formed a start up, first year in, and do business development for another cybersecurity start up that has already achieved initial industry adoption. My thoughts are when I get married in the next few years, and move to the Philippines, in time and still work remotely, what I could perhaps bring to the table for the country in its industrial sector. I am very interested in the space industry, but also permaculture, which I think the philippines has a lot of potential opportunity to develop in.

Like how to set up fog nets for additional water generation/supply, implementing machine learning with some of the farming, or solar implementation. Lot of volcanoes, so there should be some opportunity with producing electricity geothermally, and 5g global wifi will be a thing soon with starlink, so the infrastructure needed for data industry adoption is just around the corner in my opinion.

Your reply to me talking about talent was to try to shift this to a pretty bigoted view that countries not as well off as yours are less talented, or gifted.

Only you're talking about success, you might want to read what the definition of strawman is- because my argument is talent has nothing to do with opportunity. My friend was able to do paint having never done so prior- he had that talent whether he ever had that paint and to express himself, and before that he had in music.

I saw the same thing post 9-11 at the airports, in DC, NYC. I actually felt safe for once, I didn't worry about a police officer robbing me, or harassing me just because I was X minority, or worried about getting killed just because an officer decided he had a bad day. Which I think are legitimate fears for a lot of people in 2020.

Until you find something better than what the US has- I'd rather put my chances in military assuming their duties than trust a unionized force of trigger happy highwaymen. Because thats what the USA effectively has now.

I'd rather trust our fates to an AI I know we can see the programming of and make sure its as bias free as possible.

Because you know what the two most common questions are I get asked as an American abroad?

What's wrong with our president, and what the fucks up with our police. Foreigners love playing clips of our police shooting someone black and asking why they are like that.

There is no solution to this without a huge overhaul. If you don't like the above ideas, fire every officer in waves, sub in military short term, and retrain a new police force entirely. Like how long are folk just going to let police get away with murder in the USA before they say enough is enough."
news,ff6593u,t1_ff64s2s,1579619446.0,"Can think of a few systems being tested-

AI tracking with automatic fines, you shut them out of all public services if arrested, and geotrack them so physical forces can pick them up. Depending on how you lock them out- ie if they cross a street their face and name flashes up for their listed crime, you don't even need a police force thats big to respond. System itself would isolate them for recovery.

Another one is to sub out police with actual military- this means there is no longer a vested interest in them producing revenue for the city. We did this post 9/11 and I had no issues with soldiers on every street corner in DC- better cops that could just arrest you for w/e racist reason they had on their mind.

Removing elections to appoint officials to sheriff is another.

Theres a bunch of ways if someone breaks the law you could lock them out and scoop them up easily. 

You could have an AI track someone with a drone, good luck beating out a swarm when every place youve ever even remotely been to is being cased out.

That being said you are right, it is a mish mash. For example, in the chung do kwan school I had, we had folk doing legendary breaking with up to 7 inches of concrete without spacers. Wacky stuff, like barely moving the hand and cracking the 1inch slab. After awhile I was able to backwork that to effectively live hands in hapkido- where you splay the hand to hyperextend the tendons and then relax to say relieve or deliver a fast enough strike to deaden the area hit (numbness). I created a discord server, and after awhile someone from the kenjutsu community pointed out they had the same technique, but it was utilized at the end of throws to give extra ommpf for the impact. Looking at chung do kwan, and his kenjutsu style, the only points of commonality between either is there was some back history with kempo, or more specifically, someone went back to learning cma, either in china itself and reimporting those CMA based techniques (as was the case in the kenjutsu style of this dudes kashima school) or was reintroduced with tae kwon do.

&#x200B;

Kempo basically harkens back to shaolin arts, so I tracked down someone who had been a monk with the primary shaolin group in china where they live there and pray and train and whatnot and repeated the above to him- his explanation was the technique itself doesn't exist in shaolin as we use it, but comes from a defensive technique.

&#x200B;

So that's a freaking mess to try to figure out what the heck this technique was.  And while its great to have it now, it clearly drifted from its original purpose between shaolin kempo and kenjutsu, and shaolin to quanfa to tang soo do to chung do kwan.

But its funny, I've been asking this question, and after grilling our CMA community, and the other 4th dans on the server, as well as the 3rd, we could find a definitive answer.

taekwondo,feft0ig,t1_feds2ql,1579064304.0,"That's an interesting thing you point out there- Ki is a japanese idea where you express energy from the self internally to resonate with the external.

&#x200B;

Chi is similar, but it is solely about the internal with yourself. This is sort of why kiai are so much more prevalent with a theory behind them in many CMA.

I think the question this asks is what is the actual focus of the intent? No one has ever directed me concerning that specifically."
taekwondo,fefswf9,t1_fed6f14,1579064208.0,"Thank you! I enjoy this kind of stuff. I had the pleasure to train with Clarence Murray in the early 2000s and I really enjoyed his approach. While not tkd, a shorin guy, he would take all the techniques from our poomsae, and develop 2-3 applications with each, from striking to grappling. I still teach his application of chumbi, though I doubt anyone would use it. I'm just a big believer in finding utility even in the things others would argue (or are documented) as for aesthetics."

I work corporate- its so weird to me to think women have dress codes like that in the 21st century. I mean, don't they cause sprains a lot? Should get hazard pay if theres a dress code."

AmItheAsshole,fe7d7o7,t1_fe6xm31,1578912956.0,"Well, I just hope everyone finds running in heels comical. Anytime someone uses it outside of its place I reckon its somewhat humorous, like trying to hammer a nail with a brick, or iron your shirt with college textbooks.

To be honest I'm not 100% sure what heels are used for- am 5'4"" so like, women just dont both usually XD. But having worn them, well, I can't see them being useful for running? It takes practice."
AmItheAsshole,fe6wq05,t1_fe6wlhy,1578906812.0,"Perhaps, but isn't that like saying the straight perspective when it comes to queer is irrelevant? I mean I definitely feel you when its solely about inter queer culture, but at least pertaining to OP, this seems to me about her son's entreatment of hetero culture.

I think in that regard the straight perspective is kind of relevant, cause the entire issue in a sense is she is supportive, but feels as if her background is being degraded."

Im not trying to get into the whole gay culture vs hetero vs sexism and whatnot, but reading what you wrote reminded me a bit of my experiences dressing in drag, so I made the comment because of that."

I feel you on the recap meetings, but you can do that with emails to reconfirm points from the recording of the meeting, which also documents things to corroborate the notes. Its cybersecurity and so much NDA and things shift very urgently after significant pauses that its just easier than reconvening about the same issue unless theres been some change."
