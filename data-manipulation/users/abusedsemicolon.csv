I have an ileostomy and have had a J pouch constructed. Iâ€™m still deciding if I want the second surgery. I just felt like I should throw in some balance because you seem to be getting only anti-j pouch comments. We both have a lot to think about!

Personally Iâ€™m leaning toward going for the pouch because the ostomy is causing me a lot of issues and Iâ€™ve only had it for five weeks. Iâ€™m not sure I can deal with it for life. In my case it seems to be a lesser-of-two-evils choice, honestly!"

ostomy,fefs1h2,t1_fefnnxv,1579063502.0,"Thanks so much for the response! Iâ€™ll reach out to Coloplast and see if theyâ€™ll send me some convex wafers. Iâ€™ve been making the wafer as small as I can without restricting the stoma; the main issue there seems to be that my stoma is not quite circular, and itâ€™s hard to get the right shape. Thatâ€™s part of why I tried the barrier rings, but they just puff up and ruin the seal. I always applied the ring to the skin, not the wafer, because I could get the shape better that way. 

I do use the marshmallow trick already, it works like a charm!

Unfortunately there is simply no way that I can change the wafer every time it stings. I donâ€™t have enough supplies for that and I cannot afford to buy enough supplies to change my system *that* often. At the moment if it burns and Iâ€™m at home, I jump in the shower and try to rinse it as well as possible and get the stool out from the little valley between the wafer and the stoma. It usually helps for a bit. 

I do have an ostomy belt, but Iâ€™ll have to play around with the fit and see what I can do. My stoma is level with the top of my pelvis, so the belt tends to ride up to my waist where itâ€™s most narrow and loses tension. I spend a lot of time holding the flange with my hand to get more pressure."

ostomy,fe36l20,t1_fe33s72,1578846489.0,"From what Iâ€™ve read, the success rate isnâ€™t that good, pouchitis is common (especially since I have mine for ulcerative colitis), and for the first few months thereâ€™s no guarantee of continence. Basically it sounds like going back to a colitis flare. I think one site said something like 25% of people end up wearing pads or diapers at all times. I just donâ€™t want to deal with that like I had to for the past four years straight. 

On the ostomy side, Iâ€™m having a lot of issues with skin irritation and I donâ€™t know I can stand it for my whole life. Thereâ€™s a high hernia risk and a high blockage risk. I donâ€™t like the idea of needing regular supply deliveries in case I donâ€™t have such good insurance once I graduate. Basically having the bag is higher maintenance. Also sneezing hurts like a bitch. 

TL;DR I want the j pouch for convenience, but Iâ€™m worried that it will be like having colitis all over again. Overall my life has greatly improved with the bag and I havenâ€™t had any issues with insecurity/body image because of it or anything. (Iâ€™m 24F)"
ostomy,fe32lk8,t3_enovik,1578845292.0,"I just had the j pouch creation + temp ileo done last month. My surgeon said I can keep it basically however long I want (though I understand success rate for the j pouch goes down if you wait *too* long), or I could choose to have it made into a permanent one. I was set on a j pouch before the surgery, but at the moment Iâ€™m not actually sure anymore. 

All that to say, you potentially have a sort of third option. Maybe see what he thinks about doing the j pouch route for now if you want more time to decide, since for me it can still easily go either way. A week isnâ€™t very long to pick something so big. The downside of that is that if you do end up choosing a permanent ostomy, youâ€™d be having two surgeries instead of one. Personally I loved having surgery, but Iâ€™m weird (and have good insurance).

E: Iâ€™m not saying you shouldnâ€™t decide now if you know what you want, just saying personally I had months to decide and Iâ€™m still not sure lol. Iâ€™m interested to see what others who have already decided say."

An organized hospital would make me feel much more at ease, and it sounds like your GI knows the guyâ€”if theyâ€™ve worked together before, youâ€™ll have a better time. I donâ€™t really think rankings and pedigree are all that reliable because a lot of the time those things can be pay-to-play."

No gridding or parking for me, it takes too long. (Side note: non-stitchers always remark that I â€œmust have sooooo much patienceâ€ and itâ€™s just not true at all. Lol) I basically do two things:

1. I highlight the pattern pages as I go to keep track of my progress. If itâ€™s a pattern I think Iâ€™ll do again or on glossy paper, I make a photocopy to highlight. I also change highlighters with each page so I donâ€™t get sick of the color. 

2. I start in the center of the piece and work outward, finishing each page before moving on. That way I can have it centered on the fabric and not have to pay as much attention to leaving borders. I do as much block color as I can, choosing the most frequent colors first as I work outward. Sometimes I have to stop a color and come back to it if the jump is too far. Once the entire page is within a few squares of a completed stitch, I do whichever color I feel like doing at the time. 

Some people say going page by page makes page lines, but with confetti-heavy pieces Iâ€™ve never noticed such a thing. I do preemptively combat it a little by burying start and end tails in the stitches from a neighboring page or working slightly ahead on a few colors in the shaded â€œthese squares are on the next page, donâ€™t double-stitchâ€ areas most patterns have. That seems to be sufficient, if itâ€™s even necessary at all."
