LifeProTips,febmt77,t1_feaid4l,1578960528.0,Then I'd vote for people that champion social programs.
LifeProTips,fea7flq,t1_fea74hf,1578945241.0,True shit. My parents taught me to never go grocery shopping hungry. It's the difference between coming home with bags full of snacks vice bags full of meals.

Blackfellas,fe3bhsb,t1_fe0roau,1578847765.0,But we knew this already.

Blackfellas,fdzxwym,t3_encd63,1578798505.0,"I know this sub has UK black folk that worry about this, because it's more important to your day-to-day life. But why do American black folk care what's happening over there? Let them handle their business.

Downvote all day. I don't get why black folk in general are worried about the monarchy."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdpl7xg,t1_fdoe3k5,1578631726.0,Too young to have that real GRIT face. It just comes off as an uninterested pre-teen.
worldnews,fdoqlq7,t1_fdo7mu7,1578610639.0,Was it a missile? That could have been an engine blowout as well.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdjg35r,t1_fdivy5m,1578469287.0,and THIS is related to why I don't believe in ghosts. How in the hell are there not millions of native and black ghosts wandering around and haunting the shit out of descendants of settlers and slave owners until they repair their ancestral damage?
aww,fdj9rmb,t3_ellck2,1578462603.0,"My younger brother and I used to beat the hell out of each other playing video games - black eyes, bloody lips, yelling, etc. It got so bad our parents banned us from playing the same game with each other for months. 

But let one of us ruin something, and the other was always there to help glue the statue back together, clean the spot on the carpet in that room we're not supposed to be in, pull the dent out of dad's car, etc. 

We were the epitome of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend."""

Futurology,fdiutk8,t3_elbf2s,1578451530.0,BRUH do we really need to be researching 30x powerful weed at this point? The legal stuff I buy now is already powerful enough. Then again I like keeping a low weed tolerance so my shit lasts longer.
Blackfellas,fdinpei,t1_fdinc4h,1578446983.0,"Thanks. Sounds like the show is keeping pace with the latest star trek movies. Basically action movies in space. I liked the movies as blockbusters, but they didn't feel like Star Trek. 

Maybe I'll like discovery if I know I'm watching an action show that happens to be called Star Trek"
Blackfellas,fdina87,t1_fdin23i,1578446714.0,"Hell yes on Orville. If the acting is good on Discovery, I might be able to stomach some bad plot."
Blackfellas,fdin83e,t1_fdimumd,1578446676.0,Huh. Yet another reason to give DS9 a second chance.
Blackfellas,fdimztg,t1_fdimh5g,1578446530.0,"Sisko was dope from the little I did see of DS9, that show just never hooked me. That Bajoran Jesus line has me curious to give it another look though. And I didn't even know Janeway went man-up against the Borg... I may have to reevaluate watching that series too. 

And Scott Bakula is a personal favorite from Quantum Leap, but even he couldn't save that show, lol"
Blackfellas,fdim1wp,t1_fdij88d,1578445920.0,"Sidenote, how is Discovery? I wanted it to get a couple seasons down before I started, because I hate getting into shows then they get cancelled on me."
Blackfellas,fdik429,t1_fdij88d,1578444689.0,"I get it, and I definitely see the argument for colonialism in ST, but I also think that's a great storyline to play nowadays, almost retconned. When we see the klingons in TNG, they're not necessarily cool with the federation, but they're not necessarily bitter enemies either. They eventually joined if I remember correctly. Yeah you had extremists on both sides drumming up conflict, but the klingons understood bigger threats (the Borg, Romulans). 

Hell, at least when the federation colonializes, they actually bring trade and goods to folks. 

Anyone, feel free to correct me - I was really only down with TNG, haha. Picard is the best Star Trek commanding officer, fight me."
Blackfellas,fdici4y,t1_fdhxmhm,1578439799.0,Ironic because Star Trek's whole deal is about discovering that differences between races (species) and finding common ground.
graphic_design,fdhbtf9,t1_fdg5o1n,1578419577.0,"I know they're not wrong, I said the kerning could be adjusted. Don't make up silly stories about what you saw though. It's totally fine to say ""adjust the kerning"""

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdg2zgg,t1_fdfrtbw,1578378095.0,That scene legit stuck with me to this day. I didn't have to be alright at a lot of things -- I could be really good at a few things.

graphic_design,fdfhj36,t1_fdffaox,1578361833.0,"I don't get it. your eyes skipped over 2 whole, bold letters and a space, and squashed it all together. THEN, the word 'heroin' made sense to you in what was clearly a shoe ad based on well-known ninja turtle colors?

Adjusting kerning is a good call, but too often on this sub i see absolutely ridiculous mindbends to make a point."
OldSchoolCool,fdfagje,t1_fdfa43n,1578357092.0,"I believe I'm decently well-versed.

I lived in Japan for 2 years. In that time, I traveled to Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam,Thailand, Cambodia, and American territories the Philippines and Guam. I've been around many different Asian nationalities, and the worst I've ever got called out loud was ""gaijin"" by drunk middle-aged Japanese guys. And even then, we weren't sure if he was talking about me, or my white friend next to me.

Never, in my time over there, was I ever harassed or pulled over because I was black. Would you like to know how many times that has happened to me over here?

And what about you? How much time have you spent in Asian countries as a black person?"
OldSchoolCool,fdf7juc,t1_fdf7emr,1578355130.0,"How many police shootings or lynchings have Asians committed on black people? Without googling, I'm willing to bet less than America has."
