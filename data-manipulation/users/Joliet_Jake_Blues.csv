He was not allowed to live in a home with other children, was eventually put into foster care and was placed on a sex registry that was made public when he turned 18. He struggled to graduate from high school, and was shunned because of his registration status. And when he enrolled in college, he said, campus police followed him everywhere. He dropped out. Now 26, the report says, Jacob’s life continues to be defined and limited by a conviction at age 11.](https://publicintegrity.org/education/report-details-lives-ruined-for-children-put-on-sex-offender-registries/)"
