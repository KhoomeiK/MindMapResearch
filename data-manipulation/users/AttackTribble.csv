scifi,ffbwj7h,t3_ess5bz,1579785102.0,"Season one wasn't the best, it's true. It gets steadily better, IMHO, until the end of season four. The studios screwed the show's creator over, making him think there wasn't going to be a season five until the last minute so he crammed the rest of his entire story arc into season four, then they gave him a season five which he kind of struggled to fill properly and it suffered as a result. Season four's going to kick your ass though.

It's a pity, there's a couple of loose ends he could have used in season five that he didn't, I think because he thought he was going to be able to make movies out of them. He ended up doing books about some of them though.

You might like to look up Babylon 5: Crusade, but sadly the studios screwed him on that one too. Put it in a terrible time slot so it got bad ratings, demanded he add sex to improve the ratings, he said no and cancelled it himself early.

Do *not* bother with 'Babylon 5: Legend Of The Rangers' though. Trust me on this. There's a reason that pilot never got picked up."
