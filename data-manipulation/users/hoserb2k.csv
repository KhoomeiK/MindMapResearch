selfhosted,ff1xkh4,t3_er4kqz,1579488468.0,"Maybe not the answer you want, and also maybe something that will work for you. I've looked at this a lot and my conclusion was that it's not really viable to self host something like this for the following reason: the heart of a music recommendation system is data not software. The actual deep learning pipeline that recommends songs and generates novel playlists is not particularly novel or hart to implement (though it's not super easy either), there are several projects on github right now that can recommend songs for you today - if you bring your own data. 

The magic sauce that google and spotify have is a large base of users from which they can analyze played songs, compare with other users and make recommendations. They also have a catalog of most recorded music and virtually all new music in the traditional market. 

No matter what, you'll need a 3rd party source of data, if for nothing else than you need to feed in new music data when songs get released. My compremise is this: Spotify has great recommendations and playlists, better than google IMO. I use an [unofficial api](https://github.com/zmb3/spotify)  to create playlists and recommendations which can be downloaded from spotify directly if you pay for a sub or sent to [lidarr](https://github.com/lidarr/Lidarr) to get it from the internet. It's all my MP3s and my player, but the song track data and playlists/recommendations come from spotify.

If you really want to host it completely yourself, you could look at a fully complete project like [this](https://github.com/Allianzcortex/MusicRecommenderSystem)."

IAmA,fev65ir,t1_fev3i65,1579393500.0,"> My understanding is that a new car MSRP and price is much less flexible than when buying a used car.

Not necessarily. It's complicated, but the short version is car makers know the internet exists and ideas like ""MSRP"", ""Invoice Price"" ""Cost to Dealer"" mean a lot less than they used to. Depending on the maker, there can be significant post-sales ""incentives"" (money given to the dealer by the manufacturer for the sale of a new car) to the point that the dealer can take a ""loss"" on a new car and still make money. 

Used cars can be (in the right situation) vastly more profitable todealer than new, depends mostly on how you finance it but other factors too.   

The golden rule of buying a car is always be nice but remember that a car dealer is not a charity and is never going to try to lose money.  Try to figure out how much money they are making off you, and what is the lowest number they will accept. Look around on the internet and talk to as many dealers as you can about the same car and you will probably do as well as you can."

We all tried to tell adults (doctors, police pastors) and we all got told that our parents were our parents and to respect them. The girl that got raped was even admonished by the police for being so bad to her uncle to say such a thing.

Children have almost zero power and if you parents want to abuse you, the essentially have free reign to do it. I think most parents have good intentions but there needs to be better protections in the system against the bad actors we know are out there. An expectation if the Doctor has a credible reason to believe telling the parents would harm the child combined with a mandatory report to child protective services.

edit: Most of the time, almost all the time the healthcare provider should absolutely tell the parents of a child, but they should also have a way out in some circumstances, such as if the child tells you they fear abuse or harm if their parents find out. This may technically exist now I’n in some form of legislation but haven’t seen any evidence that it’s sufficient.

CatsAndDogsBFF,fendwsf,t3_epp1tw,1579282602.0,"Hey, you sound like you're going through a stressful time. I know what that is like! I've managed to do something like what you've said your trying to do. First, and this is the most important thing - When working with living creatures, you must always keep in mind that these are beings with independent thoughts and feelings. Just like humans you can try to persuade, convince or even force (do not recommend) but there's no simple list things you can do to make your dogs and cat like each other. It may not happen and that's ok! Just do your best to observe your animals reactions to training and adjust like you would interacting with a person. That said, lots of dogs and cats can coexist and even be friends. here's some of what worked for me. I'm NOT a professional and all animals are different.

1 - The best piece of general animal handling advice I've ever received came from an experienced zookeeper. It's simple and applies to every animal - ""Make every interaction positive."" Overall your plan of attack for getting cat and dogs to coexist is to **gradually** engineer very short, very separated interactions with cat and dogs and to keep them positive.

 2 - Separation: Stage one of this is pretty much the situation you are in now. Dogs and cat are fully separated. No possibility of physical contact, and If your cat seems like it's still in distress you  may even go farther and add visual barriers like a temporary bedsheet. The key is to get the cat to feel safe and protected and for the dogs to know they can't interact with the cat yet.  

3 - SLOW SLOW introductions: You mentioned you tried to introduce cat and dogs, and the dogs got very excited. This is normal. What you need to do is engineer situations where the cat can learn that the dogs won't hurt it, and the dogs to learn it can't treat a cat like a human or another dog. Work with one dog at a time, and if they are too excited, a great tactic is exercise the pup until it's tired! The dog will love it and critically make it more docile and less excitable. 

When you start this, the animals should still be physically separated. Play with the cat (or treat, or whatever the cat likes) on one side of the baby fence and let your dogs see it. Play or train with your dogs around your cat, always making sure that they can't reach each other. Give them treats and praise or whatever makes them happy while you are doing this, you want the cat and dog to associate this with positive feelings.

The next level is usually something like keeping the dog on a leash and bringing it near the cat. ""Near"" might just mean the same room or even just walking past an open door. We are teaching the cat that the dog will not hurt it, and teaching the dog not to play with the cat like it would with a dog or human. Again, if the dog is very excitable you may need to give it some hard exercise before meeting cat so it's nice and tired. Give treats and praise the dog for good behavior, likewise to the cat

The final level is unleashed but supervised interaction. Again, praise treat and positive interaction is key. This may be a fast process, it may be slow and take a ton of time but the TLDR is slowly slowly have them interact with each other, starting with little interactions at a distance and work up.

This may seem like a lot, but keep in mind animal training generally works best in SHORT repetitive interactions. Short is good, short keeps animals from getting bored or too worried. A few 5 minute training sessions in a day will be more effective than a single long training session and you can do it whenever you have a few minutes. Be patient and you can do this!"

badscience,fej8202,t1_feijfbs,1579160866.0,"Lived there for a couple of years, this is just my opinion. 

I wouldn’t say that Russians are any more or less dishonest than anyone else, but it’s critical to keep the conditions in which Russians are living in mind. Politically the country is much less stable than in most places in the west, economically conditions are much worse than most places in the west.  

Academic leadership is much more likely to be the result of political patronage or money than merit so in many cases, oversight and operational implementation of the academic publishing process is lacking in quality  or corrupt. Because the economy is so crummy, positions that require publishing papers are relatively more valuable and the incentive to cheat is higher.
