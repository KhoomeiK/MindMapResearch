Regular, army approved gang rapes of everyone they could get they're hands on, regardless of age, as long as they were women. They nazi's were pretty genocidal, but the russians and Japanese occupied, molested, and murdered any women they could on masse. The germans also did some raping, but the big difference is they never got explicit orders to do that."

evangelion,fg2brfs,t1_fg1ip1o,1580442043.0,So basically the ending and the movie are the same thing. The movie is what is literally happening in the world while shinji is having his little break down in the film. The end of the film and the end of the show (where he learns to accept himself) happen at the same moment. Theres also a theory that the rebuilds are sequels building off this moment instead of direct remakes of the series.

That said, we DO have the technology for massive fleet ships, since we know bigger ships like the drifters hauler and massive space cruises exist (one of rasputin lore tabs describes a conundrum he had to solve, whether to save a damaged fighter ship or a cruise filled with people). Plus we know from the taken king that dead orbit also had a huge fleet of ships they had to move away from Saturn. Maybe one day we'll be able to get one. Or at least see one.

They kept some of the new-type trope alive using more mechanical, rather than biological, explanations, the suits looked nice, and the fights were pretty epic. The characters were a nice blend of serious, often being very murderous and angry during battle, but reverted back to just kind of being kids and teens during down time. Most gundam series I've noticed also try to be vaguely political, so seeing this one deal with corruption and child soldiers was interesting."
