dogs,fezanlg,t1_fevw1lu,1579455406.0,"If he ate it right away, I’d probably never know. The first few times I found it while cleaning and I just sort of scratched my head.. Why and how the hell did butter get in the sofa??! Then I noticed teeth marks in it. I showed it to him, and he did the “guilty dog” thing (turned his head and refused to make eye contact). Busted."
dogs,feyyrqp,t1_feya795,1579452149.0,This. Exactly.
dogs,feyyd91,t1_fexd553,1579451989.0,I just spit coffee laughing at this!!
dogs,fewwzlh,t1_fewqpod,1579420784.0,The salt content is an interesting theory! Thank you!!
dogs,fewwpyq,t1_fewcrbq,1579420669.0,Hahaha! I thought the same thing when I read that. It reminded me of the “do not leave children unattended” signs at the zoo!
dogs,fewq002,t1_fewmtoz,1579417764.0,I wondered if he was missing something from his diet. When I brought it up to our vet he just shrugged it off though. And then it wasn’t an issue for so long that I didn’t even think about it anymore. Until today!
dogs,fewl7oa,t1_fewjix3,1579413352.0,"As odd as this may sound, I have never considered putting butter in the cabinet until after I made this post!"
dogs,fewkvsj,t1_fewjerv,1579413028.0,I can totally relate to that. Baked goods are safest in (or near) my bed!
dogs,fewklaw,t1_fewg223,1579412750.0,I actually just heard about these today from this post. I’m going to look into that!
dogs,fewkj7d,t1_fewfl77,1579412696.0,"Yes! The same thing for us! Once we figured it out, we were pretty diligent about where we kept the butter- until today apparently!"
dogs,few89k1,t1_few7uo0,1579406796.0,"Nah. My husband used to think the same thing. It’s good for a few days at room temp though. Although- even when my dog doesn’t steal it, it doesn’t last long enough to go bad."
dogs,few7qo6,t1_few1ux5,1579406554.0,Haha! My dog just eats those whole!
dogs,few7c66,t1_few6y4w,1579406382.0,That is too funny!!!
dogs,few5jgc,t1_few43xl,1579405713.0,lol at the photo of my dog next to the butter!! That’s probably the best advice yet:
dogs,fevzlol,t1_fevx1wf,1579403482.0,"Well- regarding his regular access to butter- in the 4 years we’ve had him, he’s probably gotten ahold of 5-6 sticks. Also, did I mention we live in Wisconsin?! Lol"
dogs,fevqnqw,t1_fevo3yf,1579400346.0,"Under any other circumstance that would be funny. But I live in Wisconsin, and we take out butter seriously. We put it on our counters in these things called butter dishes. And we use it on just about everything, including our coffee."
dogs,fevhsb0,t1_fevhl4g,1579397627.0,"Don’t be sorry lol- it’s funny, and endearing and alarming all at once."
dogs,fevgnvk,t1_fevfqxa,1579397169.0,Lol it’s just so bizarre! Why butter? And why hide it??
dogs,fevgja9,t1_fevfr13,1579397116.0,Not asking how to avoid it. Just curious if anyone else has experienced this- or knows why he would be doing it.
dogs,fevgd0q,t1_fevfhd5,1579397040.0,"I hadn’t thought of that. JK. Yes, I had thought of that. We have 4 kids, busy life, occasionally someone leaves the butter dish on the counter."
