sugarfree,ffc9vsu,t1_ffc2g84,1579794843.0,"Those are so good. On a flight back from Switzerland to the US, I ate an entire package and when we landed I was so swollen. Get back on the wagon. You can do it!"
sugarfree,ffc8vot,t3_essyxx,1579794206.0,I'm starting day 3. I finally feel less bloated. I'm going to fast today then continue on.

AskAnAmerican,ffb0vu1,t3_eshnrz,1579749037.0,"Pretty rare actually unless you act/drive completely crazy. I haven't talked to a police officer other than at work (I'm a Public Librarian and they cruise the library occasionally) in over two decades. But, I'm also a middle-aged, middle class, white woman. I also follow the laws."

sugarfree,ffaraut,t3_esd1it,1579742659.0,Something that has really helped me as well is yummy hot tea. They make so many delicious flavors and hot drinks really fill me up. I don't eat past 8 then I'll start drinking hot tea and I don't even crave a sugary snack.
