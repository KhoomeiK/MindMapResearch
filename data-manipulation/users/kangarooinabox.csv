coolguides,ffcay9x,t1_ffc6ssm,1579795513.0,Ah okay that makes more sense. Out of curiosity what do you guys do if the suspect is known to be wearing body armor? Do you proceed with the same rounds or bring new ammo/guns to deal with the situation?

coolguides,ffby91h,t1_ffapzjj,1579786588.0,Kind of a weird question but why don't they issue something like the extreme penetrator or defence instead of a hollowpoint? Wouldn't it do much less damage to the person is you do have to shoot them? And I'm assuming it would also penetrate better if they were wearing body armor?
