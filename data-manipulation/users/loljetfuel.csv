Even coming from a point of view that slaughtering animals for food is immoral, calling it _genocide_ of all things is incredibly disrespectful to the victims and survivors of genocide attempts."
gadgets,ffeanf0,t1_ffdzxc1,1579841405.0,"This assumes ppi is pixels per _square_ inch, when it is not -- it's pixels per _linear_ inch. A 1-inch square at 14k-ppi would have 196,000,000 pixels. I [explained what that should mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/esya6k/mojo_visions_ar_contacts_put_14k_pixelsperinch/ffea6sd/) elsewhere in thread; TLDR: about 3.8 megapixels for a round display of average pupil size.

Now, they _could be_ doing a marketing thing of claiming ppi when it's really total pixels or pixels per square inch. I wouldn't be surprised. But a claim of ""14000 ppi"" is a claim of a very high-resolution display."
