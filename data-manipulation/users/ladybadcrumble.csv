ATBGE,fffnitr,t1_ffflqit,1579887773.0,"No, it's fine. I obviously feel similarly about enjoying the ""awful"" aesthetic otherwise I wouldn't have been subscribed in the first place. Idk if it was always like this, but the comment section has seemed more and more like cringe subreddit comment sections with people gleefully piling on value judgments to things they don't like.

At this point I'm inspired by the people out there living their ATBGE lives and have been striving to be more unafraid and authentic to myself. I think the negative comments drag people down and make them feel like they need to conform or else they will get the same treatment. 

I actually started following a lot of the artists that were featured on here so I don't need this place for my dose of ""interesting things I've never seen before"" any more. 

Thank you for continuing to talk with me. I quickly looked at your reddit profile and saw that we've both been around for a similar amount of time. I'm glad that you're defending the subreddit. I think I'm giving up and unsubscribing."
ATBGE,fffk0y1,t1_fffhq1i,1579885628.0,">Plenty of people would display a small ceramic sculpture of a crumpled soda can made of human skin. Some people enjoy their Mercedes covered in classic green astro turf.

Those seem like someone's art projects to me and impossible to class as good or bad taste out of context.  A few years ago I probably would have but I think this discussion is showing me that my taste has changed. I care less about whether it's ""good"" or ""awful"" and more about whether it's boring or not. Honestly I don't think I fit this sub anymore.

I never meant to imply that anyone is a peasant or low-class for not getting runway fashion. The last couple arguments I got into here were with people saying that black hairstyles are in bad taste even though they weren't able to point to any reasons except ""ghetto"". I think I'm just tired of people passing taste judgements on things that are perceived to be feminine or non-white or lower class."
ATBGE,fffgbtz,t1_fff9jrp,1579883345.0,"Okay, I'll be sure to let Jean-Paul Gaultier know that your ruling has come down on his taste and it is bad.

Ugly art is art too. I guarantee that there are people out there who would want to wear this as is (even though that is not a qualification for something being in good or poor taste??? Plenty of people wear terrible stuff). Ugly things are not necessarily in bad taste. I'd say this is camp, not awful taste.

It is a statement and to me it's about how some people fetishize the artificial side of femininity and also about how the artificial side can be FUN. I personally like the inflatable dress but find the sex doll part to be garish. It is almost certainly that way on purpose as his audience is mostly other fashion designers. It's deep-fried fashion.

You don't have to feel the same way but please remember that you don't have the only perspective. The sandbagging on runway fashion/ art on reddit is unreal.

EDIT: TLDR: Runway fashion is meant to be examined, discussed, and criticized. Just saying, ""this is awful"" or ""this is good"" is super boring and very anti-art."
ATBGE,fff2md8,t1_fff06uc,1579874023.0,"> But concept cars could probably be produced if it weren't for the economics. Many people are disappointed when a production car doesn't look like its concept. The same isn't true for fashion - clothing....

Lots of people are disappointed when the fashion available in stores isn't the same as runway. I think your perspective is not as universal as you think. There are people out there with different interests than yours. 

Spend some time looking in the fashion subreddits and you will find people who are passionate about fashion in the same way you are passionate about cars.

Here's a few. You'll find there are MANY fashion subreddits that are highly active with scheduled events. Female fashion advice in particular has dozens of saved content about recent season collections and analyses of past seasons.

cwru,ffe9gas,t1_ffds0r2,1579840372.0,"Funny that you say comp sci. I went to case way back and originally was trying to get my comp sci degree. I hated almost every minute of it and still occasionally think about how much I wish I had spent my time and money elsewhere.

Anyway, my life is good now but I wish I didn't have so much debt holding me down from case because things would be better. My suggestion: if you don't like going to school there and you feel like every day you are struggling to meet other people's expectations, please stop. 

I know plenty of people who have taken a year off and come back to school refocused and refreshed. I personally ended up working for a year in retail after quitting the job I got right after graduation. I pursued a second bachelors in a field I was more suited towards and at this point I had a stronger self-identity and couldn't be pushed around so easily. I took classes at community college and a state school and have been working for a decent company with flexible hours for 2 years now. 

I knew a lot of people at case who just didn't mesh with the school, just like myself. Idk if it helps to feel not alone but I bet there are still a lot of people struggling there. People make college out to be like this amazing fun or meaningful time, but for me it was intensely painful. I was in an abusive relationship, I was isolated from and lost my best friend, I was sexually assaulted, my mental health was at an all time low. No one wants to talk about this stuff but it's happening to lots of students.

Does case still have a therapy program for students? Even just someone to talk to who isn't in charge of your grades could be nice. Let me know if you need anything. I'm not the most prompt responder but I promise I will get back to you."

I recently moved back to my old home town to try to make things better here. The things you say do make a difference. Not enough people are listening but it's still a difference.

Really been feeling the defeat hard for the past year or so. I've been climbing out of it but slip back in every once in a while. Rn I'm working for a company that makes automation equipment. Was talking the other day about how I wish I had gone into crafts or a trade instead. The reality is that I get joy from making things that reduce the need for work. I would feel selfish if I just did crafts. It just sucks that companies use our equipment to make higher profits for themselves and reinvest and make *more* shitty stuff quicker instead of raising wages and lowering hours. It sucks it sucks it sucks.

A few times my coworkers and I will leave work early and go get some drinks and we always drink a little too much. Last time we somehow started talking about how what we make *should* be reducing the need for work and making production more efficient. Not everyone wants to hear about the collapse. I always feel bad talking about it to my one coworker who is a very sweet kind of sheltered man my own age. He has a young daughter, maybe 2, he thinks about her all the time. His phone is always covered in notes about her feeding routine, tracking her toilet training, words to practice with her.

I keep trying to find a job where I can be more effective instead of just yelling into the void. I wonder if what I'm doing will have any effect or if I should just cut my losses, stop trying to pay off my debt, and be happy at home with my dogs and learn pottery and more about house building. That's the selfish option, though, where I stop contributing to a larger cause. 

Anyway, thank you. It makes me feel like maybe there is some third option. Always trying to live a more honest life. I don't want for it to be too late."

OpenDogTraining,ff6dx9q,t3_er8dis,1579625089.0,"Sounds like a win to me! If part of teaching boundaries has included asking him to get off of your bed and onto his, or even just rewarded him for being on his bed, he is almost certainly seeing it as ""his"" place to be comfy. A new baby is a big deal and you are being a great dog owner by preparing him for it.

Abundance of caution: It really doesn't sound like it in this case, but whenever a dog's behavior changes seemingly unprompted it can also be a sign of a health issue. Consider if he's been lethargic, had a lack of appetite, anything that is out of the ordinary. Again, I really don't think this is the issue, but dogs in pain will often try to hide their pain and can do this by creating distance from owners. Again, just being super cautious."

One thing I realize is that I was stronger then than I thought. You are too. It just took all of my strength to survive and I didn't have any left to pursue my own identity.

In my opinion, I don't think it's a great idea to address the whining and crying directly. I like for my dogs to have an outlet when they are feeling anxious or anticipatory (exception is barking at random people/ dogs). My reactive dog also has a lot of feelings to express when we are around other dogs. He used to be very loud all the time; passing dogs, holding a down around dogs, seeing a dog from the car window. As we worked through his reactivity he also reduced his whining which was a nice indicator of progress. Still yodels when waiting to be let in at daycare, though.

I was told by my trainer that if it bothered me, a bonker would be the best way to correct for it directly. We used e-collar for all obedience needs, but the bonker was supposed to be tied directly to the whining. Idk much about it but could be worth looking into.

So like, put purse on, ignore dog until calm then give him some attention as a reward. Do that a bunch until he's not even worried about the purse and then add on the step of walking towards the door. It may take different amounts of time at each step but it will be worth it. Also you may have to make chunks smaller, like if it's too much to put on your purse and he isn't calming down, you can just hold it with one hand. 

It's funny what dogs notice. Like mine would stop worrying if I had a garbage bag in my hand because he knew I'd come right back in. Laundry baskets were no good because no telling if I was using the downstairs washer or the laundromat. 

I'd also keep him in the pen sometimes when you are just at home so he associates it with being a cool place to relax. Maybe keep a special stinky treat in there that he can only have inside the xpen.  You can also try feeding him his regular meals in the xpen so that it starts to feel safe."

Leave treats in hiding spots around the house so he can sniff them out and be more independent in the house. Do ""duration downstays"" on a mat or bed while you are around or doing chores so that he learns he can be fine if not within sight. Break up your leaving routine if he anticipates your departure. Like, coat on, shoes on, sit on the couch for 15 minutes. Or leave without your coat and no goodbye. Come back in before he barks or whines.

Wanted to add, muzzle training can do a lot for a dog. The less a dog is allowed to rehearse using his mouth to make other dogs go away, the less he will try. With enough peaceful encounters the dog may learn that other dogs are not a threat and will be less anxious.

My own dog used to be muzzled at all times when around other dogs. We used a baskerville muzzle but now there are really nice biothane ones that don't look so scary. I also like the effect that they had on unknowledgable people. It made a bubble of space around us on the sidewalk and the braver people would actually ask if he was alright to pet. He always loved people, just not trusting of strange dogs while on leash. He eventually learned to relax around other dogs while off-leash but the muzzle kept everyone safe."

OpenDogTraining,fekd5bz,t1_fej6asw,1579197557.0,"Woah, your roommate's suggestion is not helpful and could actually be dangerous. You shouldn't do that at all. If he wants to restrict his dog's ability to mouth he can look into a basket muzzle that will be protective but still allow the dog to open it's mouth. Using a forceful method is not necessarily the worst thing EXCEPT that you are right that this dog could overpower you. If he is ever able to rehearse overpowering you it will just become a new game to him and as effective as the word ""no"".

Something you can do is control the reward that the dog gets from mouthing on you. Pulling your arm away is a good start but it sounds like the dog is being mouthy because he enjoys the interaction that he gets from you. It's exciting for him when you get loud and look at him and maybe move your arms/hands real fast. In his mind it is a great reward.

If he really is driven by attention, as many dogs are, you can get the behavior to lessen by pulling your arm away and completely turning around and ignoring the dog until he is calm. Become totally boring. Don't leave fingers in his view because DOGS LOVE HANDS. They are exciting and wiggly and smell like whatever you've been touching. If he's sitting with you on the couch or your bed when he does this, he needs to get off of the couch or bed unless he can be calm (a great reason to teach a ""place"" command). At this point it sounds like the dog just doesn't know this is not a good way to play with you.

I have no issue with balanced training methods but I wouldn't go into any involved training regimen until both you and your roommate are on the same page. Try getting your roommate on board with teaching a single behavior with you before getting more complicated."

Didn't want to panic but she had already been stopped up for a full day and seemed nervous and lethargic.

My dog was certainly fear aggressive and even had a bite history. I just wanted to post this to show that it is possible because I know it gets hard sometimes. 

It did cost a lot in terms of resources and time to get my boy to this state of being relaxed around other dogs but it likely wasn't necessary to go as far as I did for my pup to have a happy life. Every dog-owner set of needs is different so I always go with a philosophy of ""whatever works"". My dog does still occasionally growl or want to pull towards passing dogs when leashed so he isn't some zen master either. We are always working :)"

Edit: wanted to add to this because I've been thinking about it. Also because it might not be obvious or a source of insecurity to anyone who is new to living as a woman: 

It is also cool if it's fun for you to sit with your ankles together like a prim and proper lady because it makes you feel feminine. Like any gender norm, most of the harm comes from being oppressed and policed into conforming. Some ladies like to sit legs together, some legs apart, most do a little of both depending on how they are feeling. 

When I'm feeling femme I like getting dressed up, crossing my legs at the ankles, holding my wine glass with my wrist splayed out, and imagining I'm a 1930s film star. Earlier that day I was probably sitting with my knees a full foot apart in traditional gamer posture chugging through spreadsheets.

OpenDogTraining,fedlshm,t1_fed8vo0,1579014673.0,"This works, btw. I did it unintentionally while working through his separation anxiety when I had to take him with me everywhere. My dog doesn't whine for any of our short distance drives anymore because it's just as likely that I'm going to sit with him for 15 minutes while my partner is in the grocery store as it is that we are going to my sister's for him to run in the backyard.

However, if we are in the car for more than 30 minutes he is pretty sure we are going to daycare or the lakeside park and then the songs begin! It doesn't bother me so much plus we are pretty strict with his behavior so I think it's fine for him to have an outlet.

IAmA,fedgcyg,t1_febs8q9,1579010788.0,"Just because you mentioned hospitality and needing to know how to refer to people, another place people trip up is what trans men and trans women are. You can think of ""trans"" as a descriptor like ""Asian"" or ""blonde"". Trans women are women who happen to be trans. They differ from cis women in that they have transitioned into living as women rather than being raised as women. Same thing goes for trans men. It's surprising to some people but there are about as many trans men as trans women.

Like someone said down below, individuals in the trans community have preferences on terminology for how they identify themselves. You'll find a lot of the previous generation of trans people preferring distinctions like transsexual or transvestite while a lot of trans people now are offended by that because they associate those terms with slurs. Best to follow an individual's lead and be okay with being corrected if you mess up.

Edit: Just in case people don't know the kind of resistance that trans people are up against, somehow my low-level double-nested comment attracted the attention of a transphobe. I'm guessing based on the user name that they ascribe to the ""gender critical"" theory. They often use a chromosomal argument thus the 2 ""x""s. It's a shame to see femininity weaponized like this. I also have a suspicion that they are not actually the ""radfem"" that their username would suggest. Based on a few of their other posts they seem like a far right ideologist who finds it beneficial to be perceived as a harmful part of the feminist movement. 

So my tiny comment was enough that this person felt it needed a harmful response. Imagine the kind of reaction that they have to actual trans people living their lives. It's complicated and it sucks and it's just part of the trans experience that most cis people will never have to encounter."

AskReddit,fecq858,t1_fecg0g6,1578980647.0,"Does your maleness end at your biology? If your genitalia stopped functioning, would you still be male? Are there ways that you dress, talk to people, interact with the world that are part of your gender identity? (what I'm getting at is that people don't necessarily have to see your male genitalia or your chromosomes to perceive you as male). I feel like people have differing thoughts about this. I'm not trying to confront you about this but it's an interesting distinction. Biological sex can be a part of how we think about our gender, but it's not the only thing. 

I definitely get that understanding trans identity is harder than respecting or tolerating it. It can be challenging when it's someone close to you. My partner came out to me a few years back which is what set me on the path to really trying to understand. I feel like I learn something new every few months as I keep reading and talking to people. 

If the person in your family is expressing themselves as the gender that they say they are, they are gender conforming. Also it's possible to be a non gender conforming trans person as well. There is a lot about gender that most cis people never have to think about because our understanding is built into our culture. I'd definitely advise finding literature by trans people because the terminology can get confusing. I'll recommend *Whipping Girl* again or philosophytube's YouTube videos about transphobia (not saying you are transphobic, but he goes into a really interesting explanation of tolerance vs understanding). 

Start off with with some basics about the differences between sex and gender and go from there if interested."
AskReddit,fecf6hl,t1_fecarj0,1578972461.0,"So this is a common switch-up that happens often; dysmorphia is feeling anxiety due to thoughts that some aspect of your body's appearance is incorrect (like thighs that are perfectly normal seeming fat) and is usually associated with something like anorexia. People with dysmorphia cannot be ""cured"" with changing their appearance because they will always feel like that part is not good enough. 

Gender dysphoria is the constant discomfort that you feel when society doesn't recognize you as the gender you are. It can be successfully treated with transitioning to the correct gender. Many trans people report their dysphoria getting so bad that at some point it seems like their only options are to transition or die. Gender dysphoria is also not required to discover that you are trans. 

I always like to recommend the book *whipping girl* to people who have questions about trans women. It is written by a biologist who is also a trans woman. It is thorough and gives wonderful explanations for why certain things that seem unfamiliar or confusing to cis people (anyone who is assigned a gender at birth that matches their gender) are the way they are for trans people. It also goes over why there is so much misinformation about trans women in particular and why we seem to obsess over them instead of trans men.

You are also doing a good thing by asking questions of actual trans people. One thing that helped me to really understand the identity part of it (i.e. how do they know they are men or women?) is to stop over thinking it. If a trans man says that they are a man it's true because they are a man. 

We can come up with all kinds of philosophical arguments but gender/sex is so complicated that it can't be reduced to just biology or roles in society or femininity/masculinity. The reality is that men and women aren't opposites, they have differences but it's not the same as flipping all the switches one way or the other.

It can also be helpful to be introspective and think about your own gender. Why do you consider yourself a man or woman (besides what it says on your birth certificate)? Doing this openly can be kind of frightening and bring up insecurities but I found after doing this that I was more secure in my gender than ever and also more able to sympathize with those who *know* that they are a gender even if society doesn't see them that way.

Oh, just remembered another good one, and be honest! If someone offered you one million dollars, would you change your current gender? I wouldn't even though it would solve a lot of financial problems and make it a lot easier to fit in at work. It would be pretty hard to trick or coerce someone into transitioning."
AskReddit,fecc5ro,t1_febzy8g,1578970522.0,"Another way you can think about the word ""trans"" is that it is a descriptor like ""Asian"" or ""blonde"" or ""cis"". ""Trans women"" is considered more polite than ""transwomen"" because they are women who happen to be trans and are not in a different gender category. It also helps to answer your first question. Trans women are women and trans men are men. 

If you are interested in this sort of thing there is a great book that was written by a biologist and trans woman called *Whipping Girl*. She focuses on all of the parts of the trans experience that the media doesn't obsess over. She also does a thorough explanation of why there is so much misinformation in statistics about trans women as opposed to trans men."
AskHistorians,fec7l80,t1_fean0g6,1578968032.0,Thank you very much for this explanation. I was lucky to know my immigrant great grandfather who came from Wales at age 8 with 3 of his older brothers. Because of his accent everyone knew him as Scotty and even at the age of 92 he and my great grandmother referred to him that way though his given name was Morlais. He would always speak Welsh to us when we were little to make us laugh. He was a wonderful singer as well and just a few notes would have my mom tearing up. I don't know much about his younger days but I do know that his dad saved money for his boys to emigrate so that they would not have to be coal miners.

She's very small and sometimes wedges herself into positions that are really uncomfortable for me on the couch. If I pick her up from a comfy space too often I will be treated to a growl. The way I was told to deal with it by my trainer was to:

a) Stop picking her up so much. Lots of small dogs learn to HATE hands reaching towards them because they know it's about to get very intrusive. Ask her to move instead by using any of her place or recall commands.

b) If you are picking her up and she does growl, don't continue to move her. Let her protect herself from being handled with a growl but also tell her that she has to move with a command.

You're absolutely right that the belly-band growl was probably just regular dog stuff. You could try calling him over to you next time so that he's not annoyed at being messed around with while trying to relax.
