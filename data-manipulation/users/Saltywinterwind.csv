AskAstrologers,ffiov11,t1_ffi56vx,1579979042.0,"Maybe you can help me out. I relate to a lot of your Virgo energy as a Virgo suns and Virgo rising but as a Scorpio moon, I do a lot of what you said. I have a hard time opening up to people because I am so suspicious of them and  let my thoughts get the best of me a lot. Haha I live in hypothetical scenarios and I hate it. I balance over sharing too much because of my loving Virgo side and not sharing at all because of my Scorpio side. It comes off as really bad to people when I connect to very easily then ghost cause I need space. I don’t know maybe you could help cause I relate a lot to Virgo’s but then they don’t seem to get it when I need space or don’t want to go all out."

bipolar,ffhccgj,t1_ffhc0nl,1579929703.0,Go give them a hug if you can or tell them you love them. My sister is one of my rocks and idk if I’d be here if it wasn’t for her. She helps me so much without even knowing sometimes. Always make sure to tell them how much they mean to you. I’m glad you found a way to get healthier copping mechanisms:)
