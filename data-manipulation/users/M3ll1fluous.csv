You’re human and anyone who invalidates you’re feelings and struggles is simply wrong. I know how horrible it feels for the people you trust the most to disregard you because they don’t understand you. But the fact is that not everyone will be able to understand. That doesn’t mean that they don’t love you or care about you. And it doesn’t mean that people are not capable of loving you. I promise that there are times in which it will get better, even for just a little a while, and there will be people that will see past your sadness and will love you despite of it. There’s always hope for the future, no matter how bleak it may seem now, and you never know what little bits of happiness await you there."

It’s a fast-paced, suspenseful sci-fi trilogy that I think most can enjoy. I wasn’t really a sci-fi fan, but the engaging plot and high-stakes action helped me fly through these books."

Remember that you have a future and you never know what unexpected happiness will reach you there. There are times where you will feel horrible and experience terrible sadness, but you have to remember that there are also days in which you will feel better. Recognizing that you will not always feel this way and that there is always hope for a better day is important. There are people that love you and people that will love you that need you here."
offmychest,fdtv1gc,t3_en3cpy,1578722679.0,"I think that often times people with depression try to bury their feelings and hide their depression from those they love, including their friends and family. I don’t know if this is the case with you, but it’s possible that maybe they just aren’t taking you seriously because to them you have always seemed like a normal person. They could also be uncomfortable with the topic as there is still a stigma related to mental health."

Still, I assure you that you’ll find people that will connect with you. More extroverted kids will often be the ones to first start conversations in table groups, and becoming friends can arise from simply answering their questions, listening to their concerns, laughing at their jokes, etc. It might take a while to become comfortable with people, but eventually you will make friends. You just have to make sure to push yourself to contribute even a little to conversations at school, and eventually you’ll get better at socializing. Also, if you feel like your social anxiety is too great to do that, I would recommend consulting a mental health professional or therapist to help find a solution."
