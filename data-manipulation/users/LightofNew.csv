Charismatic 

Understands that being a general asshole will make it much harder to do the really ""evil"" things. 

Evil is objective, but most commonly it is doing something with such a self interest that you would allow misfortune onto others to achieve that goal. However, you also understand that things get done better as a team. 

Pick a goal, need it, want it, make a good reason for wanting it so bad that nothing would stop you. Then create a ""story"" around that need. Something that will eventually lead down a dark path but you desguise it as something positive, and remember it's possible you're lying to yourself as well. Now bring others to your cause, convince them that you are after the best thing.

- Constitution (health)

- Intellengence (knowing about the world)

- Wisdom (knowing what's around you)

- Charisma (Imposing yourself on the world)

-

Ability Scores range from 1 - 20

They sometimes go above 20 but that's not important. 

-

For game mechanics, dice rolls are only affected by a certain amount. These values are ability modifiers  Every time an ability SCORE increases to the next even number, the score goes up. 

- 10 = 0

- 12 = 1

- 14 = 2

- 16 = 3

- 18 = 4

- 20 = 5

Modifiers can also go negative. 8 and 9 will give you a -1 modifier. 

These modifiers affect accuracy, damage, and ability checks.

15 is really the lowest check you should make, anything below that is a waist of time. 

20 is when something is difficult. The average person couldn't do this. 

25 is a benchmark of skill and talent. Don't be afraid to give your players checks of 25 when they want to do something. If they have the skill points they can make the check. If not, then no one else can make it either.

The wizard can know any number of spells, ranging from their level + Int all the way up to every spell in their class. They only need to see a spell written down somewhere to copy it. 

Then, they can choose a number of spells equal to their lvl + Int that they can use on that day. During that day, if they take a short rest, they can reagin spell slots equal to 1/2 their level ROUNDED UP.

Wizards are objectively better in this way, if you are the type of person who wants a tool for every job and knows your DM will plan tricks and traps that you can solve then pick the wizard

Because of this I HIGHLY recommend that you switch the sorcerer's spell slots for spell points. The conversion rate is the same as Font of Magic without the value drop. Add your normal sorcery points to the total number of spell points and use this pool to cast both spells and meta-magic"
