I understand that there is some underlying reason for doing things a particular way, I just wish I didn't have to guess what is going to happen when I go. I mean, if you Google ""Wells Fargo money order"" it says you can buy up to $1,000. I'd bought money orders from them pretty much exclusively until then, but the branch I went to that particular time didn't sell them.

Existentialism,fdhhprx,t3_eleja9,1578422882.0,"I have to disagree about ""existence precedes essence"" not being a basic tenet of existentialism. Hegel having criticized it does not make it so that what Sartre, Camus, and Kierkegaard have had to say is now thrown out the window (I'm most familiar with those three).

I reject your assertion that >""there is no way a man *should* be"" is only valid if you accept that purpose is solely derived from objective truths.

 if we rephrase the statement Hume-ishly, the statement is: there is no ought, there only is. so what I'm hearing *you* say is that ""the statement 'there is no ""ought,"" there only ""is""' is false because it implies that there has to be an 'ought' for 'is' to have meaning."" and that doesnt make sense. in less confusing words, ""there is no way a man *should* be"" doesnt seek to assert anything about meaning, it only seeks to describe the human condition.

While I agree that""there's no way a person *should* be"" is probably postmodernism-flavored (incredulity towards metanarratives, there is no universal binding idea), I understand how whoever would have came to that conclusion starting from existentialism. if existence precedes essence, or as may prefer, essence emerges from existence, then there is no objective standard to be beholden to, only a subjective standard that becomes important only after it becomes important to you. ""there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.""

personally though I think the idea hits the nail on the head. Kierkegaard would agree by saying God made us completely free, and so there is no life outside the one we create with our choices. Camus would probably call it despair, that is, having to live life as if there were a way a person *should* be while knowing that there is no such way."

AskReddit,fdb26cp,t1_fd6dn73,1578252889.0,"I agree that it can give you an insight into how someone, or a group of someones, may act. but those things are bad predictors on how someone will *be,* like their personality. you can put two individuals in the same environment and it will produce two different kinds of people. 

so OP's question is can the gender of my friend predict the trajectory of the relationship, and i say no. gender, and everything else like race religion economic standing can probably predict what you spend your time doing, who with, what you buy, what you watch, etc., but the only way to say what kind of person it will produce is to get to know the product."

AskReddit,fd3xwmd,t1_fd3lpmz,1578162596.0,"not as such, no. at a young age everyone is trying to figure out who they are, what they're about, and where they fit into the world. a lot of who you are is dictated by other people. so I think it's more about wanting to fit in than it is about genuine differences based on gender.

for example, if a boy wanted to get into makeup, he might find it difficult bc of what his parents might think and what his friends might think, and the confusing things he might think about himself. nobody wants to be the odd one out. so he might find himself adhering to what is considered ""normal."" one day this boy meets a guy or girl who becomes a good friend. he might feel comfortable confiding that he has always been interested in makeup."
AskReddit,fd3ij10,t3_ejvb6p,1578158642.0,"so OP is a kid trying to grapple with the ins and outs of heterogendered relationships. you asked the question bc you wanted to know, so now actually listen to the answers instead of insisting everyone is wrong.

friends talk to each other about everything regardless of gender. when people do bad things, it is because of who they are as people, not because of anything else. any differences between my male friends and my female friends can be traced back to the individual. save yourself some grief and get to understand that the only way to set realistic expectations about people is by knowing them. nothing else -- not race, gender, religion, etc., can give you an insight into how a person will be."
