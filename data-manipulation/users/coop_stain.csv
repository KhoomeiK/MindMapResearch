skiing,ffc4uls,t1_ffc1vy4,1579791562.0,"You’re leaning your whole body into the hill  to make the turn instead of rolling your edges and pressuring your outside ski. This makes you super unstable and additionally can cause pretty much instant loss of edge pressure on anything harder than soft stuff. Additionally it looks like you were hanging out in the back seat. In an ideal world your shoulders will be matching the slope of the hill, a majority of your weight will be on your outside ski, and you’ll have hard shin pressure to help drive the skis even more. It’s a more stable and athletic position."

JoeRogan,ff1z375,t1_feph1wn,1579489520.0,That would actually be fantastic. Biden never got in front of camera in his life without saying something stupid. 2+ hours with promoter or edits would be sure to be hilarious at some point or another.

JoeRogan,ff1v69l,t1_fevzwbg,1579486893.0,Proof? Everything I can find about NLP says it’s literal bullshit being pedaled by hypnotherapists.
