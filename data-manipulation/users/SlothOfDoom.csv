funny,ffalzta,t1_ffak1c6,1579739079.0,"Not as well (no matter what the manufacturers claims).   Some work better than others but skunk spray is full of thioacetates and thiols which contain  lot of sulfur.

For skunks I usually recommend around a litre of peroxide and a quartrer cup of baking soda (will bind to the sulfur molocules to help get rid of them) mixed with  a couple of drops of Dawn dish soap. 

After that mess is cleaned up an enzyme cleaner with an added scent will help with the leftover.

Skunk spray is one of the worst things to get rid of (that an average person is likely to encounter)."
