With the Undercity destroyed in the lore, and Teldrassil a burning husk, I'd like to see Blizz rework the two BC capitals to be up to date graphically, with new areas, the ability to fly in them, and to function as the Hub for that faction on that continent. 

I'd love to see a non-broken Exodar that's hovering above Azuremyst. There could be a selection of shops in front of of the ship as it sits in a berth perhaps, ready to fly at a moment's notice. And a big Night Elf area with trees as they no longer can live in their own capital and have since moved here. 

For Silvermoon, all updated textures and a restructuring to the large scarred area on its west side. Make it into a haven for their Forsaken allies, perhaps. 

Both newly reprised capitals would need connection to the southern parts of their relative continents. We can put ships in the harbors of both. Portals too. And even some blimps for Silvermoon if they allow the Goblins to build some."

I can understand wanting to relax and play Skyrim on your Switch after years of playing it on a PC (the Switch is an Alla round great console and I love it's portability), but PS4 *and* Xbox One? They don't offer much of a difference besides some minor graphical fidelity changes, and neither looks better than the PC version (but they do both offer the option to relax on a couch with a controller, rather than sit in a chair with a KB&M)."
ElderScrolls,ffc3k9y,t1_ffbhqy6,1579790673.0,"Black Marsh and Valenwood contain elements that are just as unique as Morrowind's environment and the relevant cultures of the Argonians and Bosmer would be exceptionally great to explore from the player's point of view. 

But they can't be done right now. I don't have much faith in BGS pulling off either province in its totality. For one, the scale of their games is too small. Including an entire province is silly and they should focus on sections of a province instead so there can actually be a decent size to the cities and the regions around them (capital cities are the size of small villages in Skyrim, with about 20-30 people in them).

Secondly, I believe it would be difficult to include certain elements from each province with the current engine. Falinesti is a giant tree that shifts its position every season. That means they'd have to render the thing moving to a new location after so many months have passed in game. That's probably too much for Creation Engine (but I would absolutely love it if they pulled it off). Other games have done something similar, but I do no know if the current engine can really handle something like that in this Open World setting (I'd have to sit down and speak with someone better versed in the limitations of Creation Engine and how finicky it is).

Furthermore, the density of both provinces is another issue. The entirety of Valenwood is within Elder Scrolls Online, and while it is pretty to look at, it is just a collection of simple jungle maps that we've seen in other media. Now, these jungles fairly pretty to look at, but they're seemingly generic as well. Falinesti is not in the game (for lore reasons, it conveniently disapeared) and a lot of the Bosmer's culture is downplayed because the game is an MMO and doesn't spend much time with the same systems that a singleplayer TES game would (the Wilderking is a neat story that feels incredibly shallow when compared to Morrowind's stories we experience in the eponymous game title).

Black Marsh has two regions in ESO. Murkmire is probably the closest we'll ever come to seeing proper Argonian landscape, but even it misses the mark because of it's size and technical limitations of being an MMO designed for both PC and Console (and console hardware will always require limits be placed on games). There's so much more that would need to be included but that's very likely out of scope for such a small release.

Now I'm not saying I hate these areas either. I particularly enjoyed my sampling of Valenwood in ESO, even though it lacked much depth and the characters spouted exposition to aid in me being immersed. And Murkmire, as I said before, is probably a step in the right direction as it feels hostile to walk around in and includes a lot of Argonian culture (it most likely had more care taken in creating it as it was released far after launch and contains a lot of new assets that players hadn't seen yet).

Anyways I'm rambling a little. I'd love for BGS to create either of these but I don't see it happening until after TES VI, when they have a better idea of how to include more of these complex features. And there's an incredible story behind each race and province in the game. The redguards are not just dark-skinned humans living in a desert. Their story is one of my favorites and would easily be interesting to a player as long as they aren't ruined by their relevant game being too streamlined in order to attract more casual RPG players."

ElderScrolls,ffa9rzx,t1_ff9wed7,1579730663.0,"Black Marsh cannot currently be done by BGS. Numerous features would have to be cut. ESO added Murkmire and while it's got some seriously good stuff in it, it still isn't the black Marsh of the lore. But it's definitely a step in the right direction. I think the tech of the Creation Engine would need some work before they could tackle it. Possibly after they create TES VI and learn how to better adapt their software to what their fans have been asking for (and iron out all those gamebryo ""bugs"" that have been around since Morrowind)."

ElderScrolls,ff9bpgk,t1_ff99l54,1579709315.0,"We can easily top Vikings. They're incredibly mainstream. Folks will want something different. 

I think you need to read further into every race's lore. Skyrim was a butchered version of what it was supposed to be. They ignored half of the nordic lore. Hammerfell would be amazing because of the Nedic ruins, the left-handed elves, the three major ""houses"" that control the province, the desert landscapes, the mountainous regions, the islands off the coast, the entire story of Yokuda and the remnants of an ancient society. 

Every race has an amazing background. Even the imperials (the Slave Rebellion with St. Alessia is a very interesting read with time-travelling knights, *maybe*). If Bethesda pulls it together they can create an amazing game from any region."

The thing is, it's difficult to know ahead of time what will stick with people. ""I was there when Cayde died."" We all were. And it sucked and I *still* don't know why Bungie killed off their poster boy. But that isn't something I really look back at and go ""I'm glad I was there during that time"" because it wasn't a surprise. 

The loot cave in D1 is another fun little example. So is rhe Age of Triumph in D1. So much crazy cool loot to be released as a celebration of the franchise before the sequel hits (and my god what a flop *that launch* turned out to be). 

Actually the Age of Triumph is a fairly good example. We'll never hit that high ever again at this rate. Cosmetics are all locked behind a pay wall and the in-game loot is either mediocre looking or not worth grinding for (bad stats, bad affinity, RNG).

At this point I'm rambling anf getting upset with tbr sorry state of this game. I'll finish by saying that I don't think we should expect anything to blow us away anymore with this dev team. Whatever love some of the devs have (and there are some great people on this team), it's not being utilized correctly, if at all.
