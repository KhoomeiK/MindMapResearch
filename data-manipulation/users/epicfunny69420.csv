devo,ffb85lb,t1_ffb743p,1579754629.0,"Recent interviews, he talks about how he was such a driving force for the band and that he was really the musical spearhead that kept the band going. He's also pretty happy to talk about Jerry's involvement in the later albums he discredits. I'm sure Mark is a decent guy but he seems pretty bent on maintaining that DEVO would not have existed without him, but Bob Lewis (the lost member) says that Jerry was the true driving force behind the band. 


Jerry never gave up on promoting the band and would even forgo food in order to buy more tape to record demos on, while Bob Lewis (who brought the idea of de-evolution to Mark and Jerry) would quit saying he didn't see the band going anywhere. This was in late '76 - early '77 iirc.


Anyhow, if you look at older interviews with Mark (before Total Devo when he started doing movies and TV) he seems very open in crediting the band as a joint venture between two or more artists rather than a project he developed and brought hired help to work with."

lazzo was also known to flat out cancel shows he personally didn't like but were doing fine in ratings and beloved by [as] fans (metalocalypse, aqua teen, moral orel, superjail) and order new seasons of shows no one cares about (robot chicken, jellies, squidbillies)


lazzo never accepted pitches from women as ""they couldn't handle conflict"" until very recently when the shows Three Busy Debras and Birdgirl were put into production


he also stole the idea for the series Infomercials from David Cross, who pitched a similar pilot called Paid Programming. after David called him out lazzo decided to respond by calling him a snowflake that couldn't handle a coincidence (even though lazzo created the series after seeing the pilot)


however he is essentially the reason for adult swim's existence today and his close work with the channel up until a month ago is pretty admirable, he's probably the only person at WarnerMedia who actually gave a shit about their job on the level of executive and creative (he was a producer on Samurai Jack) and having created low-budget programming for cartoon network previously, he knew exactly what production entailed unlike other suits who worked at the network like Dave Snyder and Christina Miller."

>When Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the U.S. release of Princess Mononoke, director Hayao Miyazaki was reported to have sent him a samurai sword in the mail. Attached to the blade was a stark message: ""No cuts."" Miyazaki commented on the incident: ""Actually, my producer did that. Although I did go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts. I defeated him."" Weinstein has always insisted that such editing was done in the interest of creating the most financially viable film. ""I'm not cutting for fun,"" he said in an interview. ""I'm cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies."""
