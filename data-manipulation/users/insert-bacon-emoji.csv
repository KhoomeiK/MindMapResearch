AskReddit,ffgdkei,t3_et88ky,1579903858.0,"tl:dr- I'm the reason a socially awkward geek got expelled. At least according to his friends.

In my defense, I *did* tell him to back off more times than was fair. I was in this fairly nerdy club early in college. I'm too embarrassed to say what, but it as chock full of man-children who didn't know how to react around women. I stopped going to meetings because they were all fucking weird and I wasn't all that appreciative of the attention. If that makes me a bitch, I don't care. I am dumbing down a lot here. 

This one guy didn't get the hint. He got my number because we had the same class at different times, so we could ask each other for stuff the other might have missed. It was innocent stuff at first like he wanted to know why I wasn't at the club. At first, I told him I had to study and eventually I straight up told him I quit. Then he wanted to hang out. Then he started sending me blurry pictures from across the quad/ library/ through a window when I was in dropping a class. The semester ended, and we stopped having anything to talk about. 

Except, he kept it up. I just figured he was lonely, but I tried to set some ground rules. Like, maybe don't sneak my picture from across the lawn. We could still be ""friends"" but he needed to dial down on the stalking. This didn't go according to plan. He even stepped it up a notch. He'd LOUDLY greet me BY NAME from across the cafeteria. Like, sure, I have no reputation here but for the Love of God PLEASE don't have these people associating me with you guys. PLEASE. He resumed texting me pictures. He learned from a couple of friends parts of my schedule, so he could meet me in the hall and offer to carry my stuff. I tried to be soft. I tried to be nice. I explained that I really didn't need his help, and I wasn't in the mood to date. I shouldn't have chosen that word, because it made it worse. 

He lost his fucking mind. He'd stalk me across campus. Send me volumes of texts about the beautiful future I'd ruined. He had his friends pass on notes and gifts. They'd beg me on his behalf to reconsider. I remember the day it boiled over. I entered the cafeteria, and not only did he scream my name from across the cafeteria, but he ran over and tried to hug me. Full stop, I almost hit him. I shoved him back, instead, and told him to leave me alone. That pissed him off. He got right on my heels, towering over me, and telling me how I was an ungrateful bitch and all sorts of shit. Like if I came to a sudden stop, he was bowling me over. I finally turned around, shoved his ass on the ground and screamed something like, ""Leave me the fuck alone, you creepy piece of shit! Do I need to kick your fucking ass to get my point across? I'm never going to be interested in you, you fucking asshole. So leave me the fuck alone!"". I stormed out of the dining hall. 

Well guess who invited himself to my booth at dinner, had his friends crowd me in, and tried to force me to agree to terms. Guess who almost also got stabbed with a fork, until one of the cafeteria workers came over and told the group to disperse? Yeah. So I went to Public Safety after dinner, and filed a restraining order, marking it on his permanent file that he was a creepy asshole who doesn't understand the word No. He violated the No Contact order in less than a week, by screaming from the game room loft (Our dining hall was pretty cool, at the time), ""Fuck you, you fucking bitch! I'm gonna make you pay!"". In front of like 30 witnesses, and a member of Public Safety.  

I understand that was the last straw in a semester-long clusterfuck. I wasn't the only girl he was harassing, but I was the one who got him expelled. Because he was under a very strict No Contact order. This includes profanity and obvious threats. But his friends didn't see it that way. See, according to these equally socially doomed trolls, I should have just slept with him and possibly married him, because as women we're only allowed to be sexual objects, and a man is allowed to act like a toddler around us. Yeah right. Before I dropped out, half of them had been expelled for similar instances. The club was disbanded the same semester I dropped out, for, if I remember right, pornographic materials. See they'd get together and watch an episode of some previously voted on (fuck it, no one's reading this far) Anime, in one of the lecture halls with the theater seating and the big projector screen. Well, according to the rumor that gained the most traction, they got caught watching some hentai and had turned this into more of an XXX club than anything."

AskReddit,fen0vse,t3_eptxb3,1579274473.0,"This was only ""disturbing"" to my aunt, but my family and I saw it coming from a mile away. My divorced former Uncle, man of the cloth, and father to two boys (my cousins), was Elton John gay. I mean, very feminine and flamboyant. Funny thing is, when I was a real little kid, I used to think he *was* Elton John, even though he was very closeted around anyone with connections to his ex-wife (who he was still close with). I think little old me had a bit of a Spidey sense, for this stuff. Which is why my aunt must never find out that, \*gasp\* both me and her youngest are most definitely gay. We'd put her in the grave. I love her, but she's old fashioned. 

Anyway, it'll came out at the funeral. His long time boyfriend came to his funeral, and outed him in a speech, in his old church, in front of his entire former congregation and family. Though, to be honest, I don't think it's what Uncle G would have wanted. Funny thing is, we visited Historic Williamsburg \[Virginia\] a few years ago. We were on our way to Richmond for a show. We ended up at the historic church not far from the old Governor's Mansion. My Mom shared in not so quiet whispers that this was Uncle G's first church. Much to our surprise, a couple of old ladies *at the church* on this random ass Saturday on the hottest day of the year, were just tickled to met the late Pastor G's extended family. This had been long before he'd gotten married, had kids, and divorced, so *long* before even *I* was born. Still, they spoke of him like we'd just missed him. They told us how he'd been absolutely handsome. They'd all taken turns bringing him meals, and every eligible girl was being thrown his way. I want to think they'd heard about his disaster of a funeral, his outing, and hadn't given a damn. Though, I do remember my Mom having to break it to them that he was no longer with us. 

The funny thing here is, we hung around the graveyard like ghouls for about an hour. Because my Dad has a weird thing with graves, and he was hunting for a few historical people. Plus, it was like 20 degrees cooler in the roof of intertwined branches from centuries of close grouped tress. We only left because people were getting hungry, but I remember this. We could see everyone entering and exiting the church, my sister & I, because we got bored and parked ourselves on a bench. As we were leaving, my Mom dragged us back inside for some pictures she forgot to grab, and maybe some with those sweet ladies (like E would know, care or see any of it, but whatever). They were gone. The only people in the church was a tour group, and bossy lady who snapped at us for taking pictures. I don't remember seeing those ladies leave. 

Oh there I go getting all emotional again. I wish Uncle G had lived about a decade longer. I wish he had been comfortable in his own skin, to come out to his family, Good old southern values be damned to Hell. I like to think E would have eventually come around. It's not like she could have divorced him twice. I think she knows my secret, even though I swore both my sister and mother to secrecy (I know I'll spiral if I out myself and somehow get rejected by anyone in my family). I think he would have been the bridge, if anyone had trouble excepting me for me. Like they had no trouble loving him for decades, so they can love me."

I mean, we've been fed the Jedi side of the story (with a few cutaways to see the Sith/Empire undercutting everything) for decades. I mean, as a child, the first time I remember meeting the Fetts was in a movie theater watching *Attack of the Clones.* Of course I'm going to hate Jengo Fett. He was trying to kill Obi Wan (My Mom still has a huge crush on everything Ewan McGregor)! I was like 6, I didn't form my own opinions on much. Then we sat down and watched the original trilogy, and after probably about 100,000 questions we finally meet Boba Fett. 

'Cept he's all grown up, and ""working for the Empire"" or the Hutts. Again, this is from a 6 year olds point of view. I never get into *Clone Wars* (which, lets be real, with that one sided bias, wouldn't have changed my opinion much). I grow up. I watch the movies on repeat. All I know is laughing my ass off when Boba gets yeeted into the Sarlacc Pitt. I grow up. 

The new trilogy comes out. I start to see the Empire has a few points. I mean the Empire. Fuck this prissy First Order bullshit.  In fact, fuck everyone in this new trilogy (Except Poe and Finn. I want that TV show). After Last Jedi, I'm so done with everything *Star Wars*. *Rogue One* and *Solo* do nothing to change my opinion (This is a *Star Wars* household, and you **WILL** see the latest movie, even if its by gunpoint). I have to be tricked into going to see *Rise of Skywalker*. I get picked up from work by my sister, and she asks where I want to go grab dinner.

I see a cute girl in the long line for tickets/ snacks. My gay ass is too shy to try to score some digits, and I don't have the looks to be handed them for free. So I look for something to compliment. She's wearing a t-shirt with an adorable Baby Yoda. I compliment her. She gets excited and asks if I've seen *The Mandalorian* yet. The what now? I suffer through shitty Episode 9, though I do cry myself silly over >!Rey hearing the voices of Past Jedi!<, because hey nostalgia. I am also very tired. I go home. Entire family wants to discuss shitty movie. I do not want to pick a fight. I activate *Disney Plus*, which I had been meaning to do for Disney movies. *The Mandalorian* is on the banner.

I mean, the first time I remember meeting Jenga Fett, he was set to go toe to toe with Obi Wan. Who we were supposed to see him as the bad guy, even though the two (Mandalorian/ Jedi) have been enemies for centuries. Being an innocent child with no idea that I'd be willing to burn down a theme park over a little womp rat, of course I've seen them (The Fetts) as the enemies.

TheMandalorianTV,fejqjha,t1_fej8izp,1579183316.0,"You have a fair point. I mean, we have to wonder who that was at the end of Episode 5, standing over the dead hunters body. There's some kind of prevailing theory that Boba Fett not only survived, but somehow managed to escape the Sarlacc Pit, and thus that was him. They clearly wanted to keep their identity a secret, it is Tatooine, and he'd be a great recurring villain. If they immediantly treat him as such. 

Though, the part of my soul that lives and breathes drama, wouldn't mind seeing something like; Din finds Boba, or vice versa. With so few Mandalorians left and perhaps his legacy lost to the times, he convinces Din to trust him. Sending die hard fans into a frothy riot. It'd be like the 101 times the demon Crowley sided with Team Free Will (and that's the last time I will talk about that cursed show). The number of times I nearly had an anyresum ... my point is it'd be great drama.

Edit: I meant to add, but got distracted trying to find the perfect insult for Boba Fett. He and his father sided with the fucking Empire. Which has now wiped out the Mandalorian TWICE. He never has and never can pretend to be a Mandalorian, so help me. 

Now as for Luke Skywalker, I love him. I do. But if those assholes plan on sticking to the same timeline they established in the latest trilogy, Skywalker is putting together a new Jedi school of force-sensitive.

Like there's so many times you can visit the children's museum before people get whinny. So of course he was getting all defensive and ranting about how the oldest, hardcore fans were hard to please (because he'd been a wild child, overgrown teenager, skating, pranks, immature shit). Then she finds out, while vlogging, that she's pregnant. So she takes over the vlog channel completely. With those clickbaited ""What do my friends think of me being pregnant?"" ""Gender Reveal Scavenger Hunt!"" and just ugh. Then, of course, the kid almost dies in labor because they *have* to have it home to mix things up. Which they have to make into a clickbait video. Though they did take some time off while Mom & baby recovered. Then they released on social media this promise to post 'weekly updates'. which turned into short little videos once a week. No big updates. Just stupid stuff like, ""Should we keep this kitten my daughter bonded with?"" or ""Oh my God I saw a spider!"". Then, of course, their views fell through the basement. So they tried to make this huge conspiracy thing. They had this safe that came with the house that was embedded in the floor of their closet. The code was supposedly scratched into a beam on the floor of the FROG. The safe only contained a VHS that said, ""Don't Watch"". The video was set up in their attic, and it was hours of nothing, but right before the tape ended a ball started bouncing or something. It was fucking stupid. They were hoping to go viral. I pointed out in the comment section how obviously fake it was. I admonished the dude for his bullshit. Because he like to claim he was the first Professional YouTuber and thus he'd *never* use such tactics. Then, because I was in a fighting mood, I instigated that the children's channel was creepy and weird, because it fucking was. He replied back, her personally replied back, on his old main channel of all things, about how insulted and angry he was. Then, as if this wasn't stupid enough, his wife, supposedly, also replied, via the vlog channel but I got the feeling it was just him. Then they started talking to each other, and it was so obvious it was just him being fucking weird. Then the comment was deleted and my account reported for spam. Went back a few months ago, to see what changed. He quit YouTube. Apparently several people were ""bullying"" him and accusing him of things he hadn't done. I apparently still followed his mother-in-law on the Instagram she hardly ever uses, because I saw a picture of the kids like a month ago, flooded with comments from hangers on who wanted to know how everything was going as Kristen and Cory had dropped off the face of the planet on all public social media."

They even made a video together, which was super awkward. I watched it, hoping for an explanation as to why the huge price tag. Was he funding a new center for the strays or what? I mean I know they're based in LA but $200,000 is a *lot* of money. Nothing. It was basically the dude in the big Marshmello mask trying to pet one of the rescues and saying how much he loved dogs.

We had front row seats without paying a dime and it was fucking amazing. They had no guardrails of any kind up in those narrow, windy mountain roads, but there were crosses every half a mile. I saw a rusted out van crushed down in the valley. I remember the rainy season, because we arrived in the middle of it. I remember going into town to go shopping in the open air market, and watching a tomato bob down the river that had once been a street. Oh yeah, ***They sauce their pizzas with ketchup***. Everyone was so nice, and kept an eye on me and my equally fast and little sister. Even in the thickest crowds. My Dad could depend on people going 'Senor!' and pointing out where we'd stopped to try and pick up a kitten or something. The food was to fucking die for. There's this roadside burrito stand that I would kill to eat at again. Big as a baby, and you had to plan to get dirty eating it, but it was worth it. They had this potato family dinner dish in the market that I wish I remembered more of.  You don't pump your own gas, it's like the law or something. This one time, the guy who pumped our gas gifted us this scorpion he'd made out of twisted metal. Free of charge. Just asked my opinion of it, and handed it through the passenger window. It's around here somewhere. They really do take a siesta in the middle of the day. There were buildings collapsing to ruin all over, and no one cared. We used one next to the town funeral home, as a shortcut to the market. There was one by the gate to our apartment that I'm pretty sure functioned as a daycare, no matter the weather, even without a roof and blown out windows. This was in 2007, so they'd just launched that ""campaign"" to clean out the cops of corruption. Billboards all along the highway about who to call if you got cleaned out by a corrupt cop. I remember this place we stopped at, out in the desert. They'd never had power, so the drink cooler was some kind of joke. The bathroom was an outhouse. An honest to god outhouse. For some reason, the lot behind the outhouse was ***COVERED*** in seashells. I remember wanting to steal one, but something told me they were cursed or something silly.

AskReddit,fdh7wvx,t3_elas4p,1578417305.0,"I live in the south, but a few years we had a terrible ice storm. Everything shut down, including my job. This gave me enough time to have a complete mental breakdown about the very real possibility that I'd be driving in the snow/ ice sometime in the next 24 hours. Something I'd never done before. I turned to a comment section on Buzzfeed for relief.  The outpouring of advice was astounding. As it turned out, I did indeed have to report for work the next day. The job I had at the time was about 5 minutes from my house, and I probably would have been better of walking. I mean just in general. I was  a fat, lazy fucker. It took me half an hour to get out of my driveway and out of my neighborhood. Probably because I was going like 5 MPH and was essentially letting the Force drive me. I was a fucking disaster. Anyway, I finally make it work. The mall was deserted. Us, the grocery store, and the Chinese restaurant were the only things open. Because corporate sucks. I parked in the customer parking, because the rear employee parking was still in the shade, and better for use as a professional ice hockey rink. I almost made it in the building without making a fool of myself, but of course I wiped out  about a foot from the curb. In front of my boss, my manager, and my only other coworker who were all waiting in the lobby for me. We had like 6 customers the entire 3 hours I was at work. My boss finally took pity on me, and my new found knot and sent me home. Told me he'd finally cajoled corporate into letting him close before sunset (because they expected the roads to refreeze overnight). They'd sent a snowplow through the parking lot at some point, so I thought my luck was in the clear. Until I got to the stop light. The snow plow had essentially created a death trap, so my front tires were slowly sinking into mush. I had to miss the light, because a speeding semi blew right through the red. So I'm sitting there for lie 15 minutes, my car in park, trying to slowly rev my engine to keep the tires spinning. This, as it turns out, was a mistake. The light finally turns in my favor. No one is blowing through the red. There's one other soul, and he's across the way waiting at the red for me.  I knew it. The minute I threw it in drive, and tried to gun it through the light. I'd lost all traction. All my panic from last night, was back. I started to slide. I was heading straight for the power box that controlled the lights. I was in full panic mood. Suddenly, like in the \[Spoiler for the new *Star Wars* movie\] penultimate moment when all the force ghosts of Jedi past convince Rey that she has the power to win, I found my calm. I heard voices, several of them, all of them were telling me what to do, from the advice I'd read online. ""Turn into the slide!"" I took my foot off the gas, and started to steer. I ended up bumping into the curb, which was buried in the mush. I took a second, and then started on my way. Made it home. Cried in the car for a few undignified minutes. Fell in the carport.
