SuicideWatch,fejcbjp,t3_epeas2,1579166881.0,"My parent committed suicide. It traumatized all of us for life. He was convinced he was a burden on the family, starting with disliking his job and quitting. Then he became more and more negative, and actually was kind of a burden on my mother. He kinda drained her with his newfound negativity, but he knew how he was acting, and it drove him deeper into depression. I was too young to realize what was going on, but old enough to understand something was off. He didn't show that darker side to me and my brother. Then poof suddenly one day he killed himself, for us, so we would get better lives without him being there. But all it did was ruin my mind forever. I have been depressed for the better part of two decades, can't work, can't function properly, and wake up every time to this new universe he created. This reality where he killed himself. If he didn't commit suicide, and actually was as bad as he thought he was, I would still love him forever and beyond. Even of he lived, and became a serial rapist, I would still choose that reality over this one a billion times over. Until the fucking seas dry up I will always have wanted him not to do it.

SuicideWatch,fejb2y6,t3_epcv61,1579165024.0,"Drunken one night stands is barely sex. For me it never even filled my cravings for intimacy/sexual contact. All your left with is a drunken haze of memories with a person you barely know and maybe an STD, or the fear that you might have gotten one. In terms of going out on the town etc, I assume you are in your early to mid 20s? I just guess this because me and my group of friends was partially like how you describe your coworkers. But after turning 30 none of us want those things anymore, any one of us would rather stay at home and play games. It's only natural to want the things you want, but some of these things are not all that great. Either way, I was depressed while doing these things, and still am, and would've probably hanged myself years ago hadn't I been born in a rich country that is able to take care of me. Nothing anyone ever writes/says helps, so I don't really know why I'm writing all this stuff. I just think I read about your wants, and they are things I don't want myself, in spite of being depressed/lonely. And it's like a part of me wants to say that, if at least you don't get these things, there is a high chance you will grow out of your current needs. Or rather, grow out of feeling like they are all that matters"
