I have no compassion for anyone at all serving within the British or US military, as they're solely imperialistic entities, what the British did in Ireland the americans did in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and wanted to do in Iran. Knowingly signing up for one of these militaries I'd say does make you a bad person, you know you're being sent to other people's homes to kill and destroy, just because you're a soldier who didn't pull the trigger on innocent people doesn't mean you aren't responsible in some way for their death. 

Bloody Sunday was just one example, in Ireland we've had two days called that, we've had the black and tans, auxillaries, B- specials, internment, torture, evictions, massacres, hell over half of the people killed by the British army during the troubles were civilians. They shouldn't have been here in the first place, just as they shouldn't be in the middle east. So yes I would say my observation is applicable to the army and it's ranks as a whole .

I think in regards to more atrocities due to religion, the atrocities are already there and being committed, to pin them on religious radicalism would be simply giving an excuse for already common crimes"
atheism,fftzl4h,t1_ffty93l,1580231190.0,"I understand where you're coming from , but I'm from ireland and have seen what the (British army in this case) has done to my people. I refuse to show sympathy or compassion for the men and women that occupy their ranks because those same men and women had no issues partaking in the organisation that open fired on my people during peaceful protests. Onto the religious part however , I just doubt religious organizations infiltrating the militaries ranks could make it any worse than it already is."
atheism,fft2xc5,t3_euz2up,1580204219.0,"keep in mind tho , a lot of history , especially at that time just wasn't recorded or the records were lost, like there was absolutely nothing concrete written of Ireland until like 400 A.D. , it would be interesting to see if the events in the Bible actually took place however"
atheism,fft08ty,t3_eutqa9,1580200199.0,"To be honest, the US military has been a disgusting imperial entity for decades that's gone around and slaughtered whomever they seen fit in an attempt to seek out profit and power, but because they're ""christians"" now they're suddenly bad. They've always been bad"
SuicideWatch,fcxjgoa,t3_ejgmy7,1578064440.0,You can't do it because there's probably a hint of doubt in your mind about it OP. Cling onto that doubt and walk away from the needle it isn't worth it
