kpop,ff1nj1i,t3_er48jn,1579482130.0,"**SF9** (Youngbin)  
Without Youngbin, there isn't really a clear choice. The next three oldest are Inseong, Jaeyoon, and Dawon, also lovingly known as the chaos line. While I feel like Dawon might be able to act serious enough to be a new leader, SF9 would lose a lot of its charm that way. Juho or Rowoon might be good choices, as they're kind of in the middle of the age group, and can act serious when they need to. Rowoon is already very good at promoting the group on his own and getting attention, and Juho is very reserved and caring. Taeyang would also be a contender, but I think he might not be assertive enough with the older members if he needed to. Hwiyoung and Chani love being the maknaes too much, I think they would still good around as leader.

**Astro** (Jinjin)  
Honestly, these guys might just take the BtoB route and spin a wheel for the new leader. (if it was temporary like enlistment at least, they'd probably be more serious for a permanent change). MJ is one of the chaotic members and I think he might struggle a bit with serious part of the job, he may try to lighten the mood of a situation and accidentally make it worse. Eunwoo is a good speaker and can be serious when needed, plus he would be one of the oldest two in the group. Moonbin is a bit quieter than Eunwoo, but he would be my second pick. Rocky probably has what it takes in terms of personality and speaking, but he may have trouble with the older members taking him seriously. Sanha is just as energetic and chaotic as MJ on top of being the maknae, so I doubt the others would listen to him.

**Pentagon** (Hui)  
If Dawn was still a member, I'd say he would be among my top choices. He has good speaking and related to the other members well, the group could say together with him. Jinho is teased so much right now that I don't really see the others taking him seriously as a leader. Hongseok would probably be the best choice, he can speak well and the members don't tease him as much as they do Jinho, and Hongseok would be second oldest. Shinwon is the ""too chaotic to lead"" member here, I think the members would respect him for like 12 hours before he did something to make them lose it. Yeo One would also be a good choice, he is optimistic and would probably be well respected by the members, but I don't know if he'd be the best at speaking for them. Yanan is probably my last pick. Between his shyness and often having to take hiatuses for his health, it would be hard for him to lead. Yuto and Yanan might also have some difficulties communicating since Korean is not their native language. Yuto, Kino, and Wooseok would have the most trouble getting respect, and I doubt would want the job. Kino might be able to act the part if they absolutely needed to, but Hongseok or Yeo One would be the better fit."
