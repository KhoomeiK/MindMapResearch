instantkarma,ffm7oee,t1_ffks5sx,1580049907.0,"You’re so grandiose it’s almost narcissistic. You act like there is no police, no surveillance footage, zero security measures, and no repercussion in this world. If Captain You won’t tackle the soda thief; WHO WILL. You also presume based on my very sound reasonable choice not to have a fist fight over bubble gum that I’m a terrible person who would never do anything for anyone. Are you so high on your own righteousness that you wanna butterfly effect stealing a bag of chips. You don’t have a very grounded decision making skill set."
instantkarma,ffk5p2s,t1_ffjxrs7,1580016703.0,"That is utter nonsense. If this is a convenience store, what is the value of something being stolen? It’s worth possibly being stabbed for some minimum wage job and tackling a shoplifter? 

It’s not about getting something; it’s about not being potentially badly hurt over something of no value to anyone. That’s what cameras and police are for.  

The penalty for the shoplifter is nearly nothing if caught; it’s minor shoplifting. Yet they could be someone on drugs or mentally unstable, and could severely injure you if they have a weapon. But sure; go and tackle them for your overreacted misguided principles of saving $10 in product."
