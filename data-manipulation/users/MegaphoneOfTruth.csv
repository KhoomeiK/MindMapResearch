If you are open to suggestions (and I apologize for being presumptuous enough to suggest something), I recommend EMDR therapy and Krav Maga or some other physical activity that makes you feel good. If yoga is more your speed, cool cool. For me, I didn’t want to do yoga anymore bc intrusive thoughts and doing something very physical helped me in several ways.

I suppose being a single male would greatly diminish odds of baby appropriating. Also, baby skulls harden at about 9-18 months. Parents will need a night of sleep at some point.

If you do have children, you will disappoint them one day. It will feel terrible. If you get divorced there will be even more tricky things to navigate and odds are you won’t nail all of them. I hope your children forgive your mistakes, even if they feel hurt. We are human beings and fallible. Forgiveness is underrated. In situations of abuse, fuck that parent. It sounds like your dad made a big mistake. A hurtful and terrible one. I think you should tell him it still hurts you. That you don’t want to be angry or upset but you are. That you would like your stepdad to walk you down the aisle and you hope he can handle that and come to your wedding and be happy. If he can’t come without drama, he can stay home (like you did when he got married, although I would only add that part in your head).

Also, speaking from experience, your Dad won’t be around forever. I would hate for you to repeat his mistake and regret it one day when you look back and wish you had a picture of him next to you on one of the happiest days of your life. 

May your marriage be amazing and your life rich with happiness. Wishing your family the best.

It is totally an individual thing and I get why a group needs a defining term for the type of food they want to prep/eat, so labels are useful as well. They just don’t work for me with food and I do better without most of them (except the ingredients/nutrition info ones!). I put “intuitive eater” in quotes because that is a label as well, but it is the closest thing to how I think about food. Still happy to borrow delicious recipes from you guys!

Completely agree. I am trying to help my family be healthier by cooking and prepping nutritious and satisfying meals (still learning, though) but it doesn’t mean my husband and I didn’t order Chinese on New Year’s (for the first time in a year though, which was surprising to realize since we used to order it once a week or so).

offmychest,fcgfl0c,t3_eh0a8j,1577639413.0,"As an adopted woman with fertility struggles, I can promise you there are amazing people out there who will give this baby a fantastic life, if that’s what you choose. You get to be in control. You can place the baby and move forward with no contact. You can choose a private adoption and, in working with the adoptive couple and finding a good fit, you can ask for periodic updates and photos, or even be a part of this child’s extended family, or again, no contact. You can handle this however you think is healthiest for you two and this baby. There are all types of adoption and whatever is right for the three of you is right. No wrong way to do it, doll. 

This is obviously a huge shock and my heart truly goes out to you and your gf. I definitely recommend further immediate medical evaluations for the baby’s health as well as your girlfriend’s, and a priority therapy session to help sort your feelings, concerns, and plan your ideal outcome. You can pass along your medical histories and things like that (anonymously if you want) to assist adoptive parents. I’m getting ahead of where you are now, I am sure you are still in shock. 

If I can help in any way or you or your girlfriend need someone objective and compassionate to talk to, shoot me a message and I’ll give you my number. Wishing the very best for all of you. This is scary but I promise it can work out, no matter what decision you two make. Sending love and positivity."
AmItheAsshole,fbisfj0,t3_edcaqq,1576912151.0,"NTA. My stepson is 16 and has cerebral palsy and my stepdaughter is almost 18. I am so grateful that he is doing really well thanks to tons of therapies and techniques and excellent doctors, but he still has some conspicuous differences that can make him self-conscious. We have always focused on empathy in our family, as you are, and I think it is incredibly important for both of your kids. 

That being said, I think you need to correct your child for his impact on his brother but also sit down and ask about his feelings. I have always encouraged our oldest to talk with us privately about how her brother’s disability affects her, we want to acknowledge that is very real and exists heavily in her life. However, I would use consequences as you have in the same situation. Recognizing one’s privilege and being empathetic is the kind of human I want all the kids to be, inside and outside of our home, and I am not willing to let them accept less from themselves. 

Thirteen is a very tough age and embarrassment and shame are difficult emotions to sort. My only advice would be to speak honestly about how you feel and really listen to how both of your kids feel. You sound like a great parent."
