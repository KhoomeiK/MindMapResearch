dogs,ffiessk,t1_ffie94j,1579972153.0,"That sounds like a great plan! It seems like that's a pretty good day care, I think the issue is often with indoor facilities that are basically just one big room with a bunch of dogs, and no place for them to get away. 

You sound like a great owner, it's great that you're being proactive about preventing any possible issues. Best of luck to you and your pup!"
dogs,ffidqgk,t1_fficvz2,1579971435.0,"I don't think his reactions are over the top right now, it sounds like he was trying to communicate and the other dog was being rude, so he felt the need to escalate. You just don't want to keep putting him in a position where he feels the need to keep doing that and it becomes a habit, you know?

Many dogs don't actually enjoy day care much, especially for hours. An hour of 'testing boundaries' with another dog actually sounds super stressful. 

I always remember this one episode of 'it's me or the dog' where the owners thought their dog loved day care, but once Victoria, the trainer, observed him in that environment, she noticed his body language and actions and realised the dog was actually super anxious and unhappy there, and would much rather just stay at home and chill."
dogs,ffic8zq,t3_etsirs,1579970427.0,"Look up fear based reactivity. An anxious and scared dog might learn that 'going on the offensive', so to speak, is an effective way to keep other dogs away.

IMO you need to start managing your dog's environment better and avoid any further negative interactions with other dogs. If he seems uncomfortable, take him out of the situation."

I'm glad I didn't manage to convince them now, because it wouldn't have been a good environment for a dog. 

Having my own dog became my number one priority as I was becoming an independent adult. My boy is the absolute light of my life and I wouldn't change a thing. If it's this important to you, you might want to reconsider a few things about your life and what you want to prioritise.
