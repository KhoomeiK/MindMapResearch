pakistan,fgkc2tr,t1_fgk9vpp,1580862093.0,"Even with street fighter. FGC is such a dedicated community with so much passion and love, but stuff like the COD league get millions of dollars of investments, even though the COD esports scene is so small; whereas even the most popular fighting games are underfunded and a lot of the times players and organizers have such a hard time pulling sponsors - even though they are able to pull comparable or even higher viewer numbers than something like the COD league or even OWL."
Skookum,fgjtlo0,t1_fgjcbig,1580851146.0,This is the first thing I noticed as well. Kensingtons are great.
facepalm,fgjsu9c,t1_fgiwdk5,1580850718.0,Probably would be me. I know I haven't studied anything so it's not worth it to read any of the questions and so I just fill out the answers randomly for all the questions.
pakistan,fgjpvl7,t1_fgjp6q5,1580849045.0,"Yeah thought so. 

Man Arslan Ash deserves so much more - FGC is criminally underfunded."
pakistan,fgjn7ig,t3_eysome,1580847501.0,How much of this is just Sumail? LOL
leagueoflegends,fgi9um8,t1_fghe0bq,1580813187.0,"> Riot can never admit they missed the mark completely on Aphelios.

I'll probably get downvoted for this but Riot absolutely hit the mark with Aphelios. I can bet my left nut that he will be one of the most popular champions in the game for the next 1-2 years.

People saying that riot fucked up with him aren't remembering champion releases that broke everything the game before : Yasuo, Akali, Kaisa, Zoe, Qiyanna, Sylas etc. All became really really popular champions.

Riot didn't fuck up, they made the most popular champion of the next year."
leagueoflegends,fghcqci,t1_fggyj4o,1580781919.0,"CS public matchmaking is horrible. VAC is a meme and you will be hard pressed to find a low - mid elo competitive game without obvious aimbots or wallhacks. In higher elo they become less obvious.

Pros have to rely on third party matchmakings services to get quality anticheat functionality etc."
aviation,fgh7df9,t1_fgh5hfa,1580778419.0,"So they do have jettison capability? If so, why not just fly out a bit from populated area, jettison fuel and fly back instead of just burning through it over the course of multiple hours?

According to https://twitter.com/TomPodolec/status/1224483095547609088?s=09

They flew over quite rural / unpopulated land before going into a holding pattern."
facepalm,fgh5n99,t3_eyejvb,1580777267.0,"I mean, losing 1/3 of the world population today would probably trigger the single greatest golden age in the history of humanity. 

Maybe we shouldn't try to develop a vaccine."
leagueoflegends,fgfyl82,t1_fgflabr,1580750424.0,"I went 2-1 and hard carried one game (since I got placed low silver) but in one game my jungler was a 0/13 Jarvan and in another game, botlane was a collective 1/12 or something (teemo top hard carried that game). 

Ranked is just such a toxic environment at all levels. I realized my life was so much better without it."
leagueoflegends,fgf9e8j,t1_fgf3nzm,1580731069.0,Same. Though I relapsed last Saturday and ended up playing 3 ranked games. I think that was enough to jog my memory of why I quit in the first place :D
leagueoflegends,fgf9bev,t1_fgf0amo,1580730974.0,"Yes, C9 vs. 100T"
leagueoflegends,fge0bnk,t1_fgcuwab,1580688992.0,And then you see Zven and Caps play Senna.
DontFundMe,fgdzrl7,t1_fgdxonc,1580688733.0,"Don't think there's a bed that can be bought for $90k though. Some medical care beds I know can cost up to 15-20k USD so if it was around that, I'd believe it, but 90k is way too much for a bed."
DontFundMe,fgdwabu,t1_fgdbj58,1580687659.0,I was thinking this too. Other comments are saying they may be trying to say 'help pay the debt' and I can see it.
science,fgasg6f,t3_exme9c,1580654906.0,"So much research is being done to study how Gut bacteria affect different aspects of the human behavior, including mental health issues and even obesity. However I haven't seen any studies / research on the effects of certain foods / chemicals  etc. on the Gut bacteria.

It's so sad that most of this field is still dominated by Pseudoscience."
leagueoflegends,fga8hs0,t1_fg9p6nq,1580648165.0,If the success of Fortnite is anything to go by - A lot.
leagueoflegends,fg6a0mn,t3_ewvcps,1580560895.0,"But it's not about making people play better. It's about making sure they know how shit they are and making sure they understand it.

Flaming is about consoling yourself - not making the other person play better."
