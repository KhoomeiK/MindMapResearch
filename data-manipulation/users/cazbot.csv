DrugNerds,fdatis6,t1_fdar84p,1578249943.0,"First some terminology.  D and L amphetamine are the only two molecules which can be called amphetamine.  If amphetamine is referenced without specifying if it is a D or L isomer, it is usually safe to assume it is a mixture of the two isomers (or more specifically, a racemic mixture).  It is non-sensical to say adderall is a mix of three things - d amph, amph, and lev amph.  “Amph” _is_ the mixture of D and L amph, to use your terms.

Unlike LSD, both D and L stereoisomers (aka enantiomers) of amphetamine are pharmacologically active, but in different ways.  The wiki explains how.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall

That said, I doubt the main driver for inclusion of both isomers in Adderall has anything to do with pharmacology.  I’m speculating now, but I think that’s just how they come out using the cheapest methods of synthesis."
todayilearned,fdaae8y,t3_ekdvsr,1578243653.0,"A more important question to ask is _why_ experiments fail to be repeated.  

I’m proud to say all of my most important published studies have been reproduced by independent groups.  However, this would not have been so if I had not been communicating with these groups when problems arise.  Sometimes my papers had typos.  Sometimes I did not write a method clearly enough.  

From my own anecdotal experience these kinds of publication errors, coupled with a lack of communication with the corresponding author, are what lead to the large majority of irreproducibility.  Fabricated data are very rare.

That said, I also always reproduce my own experiments several times as a self-imposed pre-requisite of publication.  If one repetition of five fails to reproduce, I’ve usually tracked the problem down to something mundane, like an improperly prepared reagent or an accidentally transposed column on an excel sheet."

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1456449

That said I do think that at least in rats, pyruvate carboxylase fixes a fair amount of CO2 from beta-oxidation and drives gluconeogenic oxaloacete production that way.  This where the ""extra"" carbon comes from.  I've learned in humans this might not work the same way, but because of transcriptional differences in pathway regulation, not biochemistry."
Biochemistry,fc43m4r,t1_fc42q7k,1577405755.0,"Oh?  I thought the article also spoke to gluconeogenesis from acetate generally - both fat and AA?  Well it’s in the refs from the wiki too.

“Other glucogenic amino acids as well as all citric acid cycle intermediates, the latter through conversion to oxaloacetate, can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis.[8]”

Beta oxidation burns fats down to acetyl-CoA (and ketones) which drops into TCA and eventually supplies some of the oxaloacetate.  It’s only like 10% of the gluconeogenic precursors, but it does contribute nonetheless."
AskReddit,fc43ajw,t3_efun3j,1577405509.0,"I was 6 or 7.  I was playing in a patch of woods next to my house which bordered a busy street at the end of a long steep hill.  I looked up when I heard that click click click sound of a ten-speed bike coming down the hill fast, and saw some guy with his head turned all the way around, suddenly hit the sewer grate he didn’t see.

I ran up to him a few seconds after he hit the pavement.  His face under the eyes was completely bashed - just a mess of teeth and tongue and nose hair in all directions.  His eyes were as big as saucers looking at nothing, and he was breathing really ragged and gurgling.  His arms were straight to his sides, neck was at an impossible angle and his feet were twitching.

My first thought was that this guy might die at any moment, but also that I was the only one around and I had to help him somehow.  I leaned in to tell him not to worry and that I would be right back with my mom.  I waited for some kind of response for a second or two.  I didn’t get anything but more ragged gurgles, and started off running.  

Mom called 911 and then kept me away while she went to our neighbor who was a nurse.  The paramedics showed up quickly, and jumped into action for about a minute. But then they took their time loading him in the ambulance.  To this day my mom won’t admit that I was the last person to see that guy alive."

Biochemistry,fc3tdmi,t3_efyc10,1577398139.0,"Fats *can* be turned into glucose and other sugars by eukaryotes, by precisely the biochemical path that you imagine.  Why do you think they can’t?

As an example, plenty of yeasts can proliferate using fat as a sole carbon source.  If they could not convert that fat to glucose they could not make most of their structural polysaccharides, most notably their cell walls.  This causes death.  Yeast (and all other fungi) make their cell walls from chitin, which is a polysaccharide comprised of acetylglucosamine, which is made from glucose.  The Yarrowia genus is famous for its ability to use fat as a sole carbon source.

Similarly, human beings, when on a strict ketogenic diet, can convert fat to glucose, again usually to supply structural polysaccharides to various tissues."
