LeopardsAteMyFace,ffq317f,t3_etp3c5,1580117641.0,"I feel a lot of the comments in this thread belong in r/SelfAwareWolves - I hope people in this thread are aware that the right wing press and sentiment refer to a lot of people on the Left as “The Sneering Left”. 
   
I’ve always thought it was a twisted fabrication but I’m really starting to see where it comes from. If we want real social change, it’s not going to come from slagging off people who may have voted Tory but now only stand to lose from that result. 
   
It’s going to come from positive exchanges with those people, winning them over, helping them realise and spot lies and false promises, helping them understand socialist principals and why they work. Not marginalising them and making them feel further distanced from the Left.
   
Bigger picture: whether you look at election interference in the states, Vote Leave campaign, the Murdoch press or Russian trolls, the aim is to divide and conquer. The more everyone hates each other and refuses to see the other side’s point, dismisses it as unreachable, thee better it is for them to come and pick up the pieces. I advise to take a look at yourselves and question the value of being so angry at each other and ask if perhaps you have fallen for some of these tactics."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffq29in,t1_ffi6zpu,1580116417.0,"I didn’t get hoodwinked, I voted against Tories. And hold your own side? Exactly my point about tribalism. I’m afraid they’re aren’t sides, hence the Tories were able to win. A lot of people who were expected to vote Labour vote Tory instead. That’s how elections work. People get the choice. And the purpose of a lie is to deceive. So looks like the plan worked for the Tories. You and I might be angry about it but it should surely be the Tories blamed, not anonymous voters whose reasons you can only guess at."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffi00hs,t1_ffhyozo,1579960853.0,"I think desperate people in need shouldn’t be put down further. They were hoping to get what was promised by a party that lies. Not everyone follows politics, and most people have become disillusioned and think all parties lie. Some of what Labour were promising came off as sounding pie in the sky and the message was not as clear as it could have been. Tories promises were simple and clear and on point. Voters made a choice. Unfortunately we’re all going to have to watch as that choice plays out painfully.
   
   
The Left is about unity. It depends on it. To start calling those who need that unity most “dipshits” misses the point and turns politics into tribalism, rather than solutions. It’s also just a variation on looking down your nose at the poor and vulnerable.

politics,fd3060s,t3_ejx9fo,1578153454.0,Imagine having $1b. That’s mad money. Even $1m is a crazy amount. Then times $1b by 100 and Gates still has another $9b spare. Imagine. He could give that $9b away and not notice. Imagine what could be done with that wealth. He’s right. The accumulation of that much wealth in the hands of an individual is grotesque. The mere fact that it keeps accumulating shows that it far more than can be dealt with.
