veganfitness,ffuqvir,t1_ffuovus,1580247602.0,Thanks so much for that. I will definitely look at the website now. I’ve never heard of bibimbap but will look that up. Thank you again.
veganfitness,ffucvvz,t1_ffsf2cv,1580239308.0,Thanks for the time and effort brother.
veganfitness,fft2jpb,t1_ffs308f,1580203630.0,"I know it might be a bit to ask but what’s a usual lunch and dinner look like to you. Again, thank for taking the time to help."
unpopularopinion,fft2d6h,t1_ffscytt,1580203345.0,"I think this post rubbed people the wrong way!! Wether they disagree or are to scared to attempt a change. This will still be in the back of the mind!! 
If it hits negatively, that means that it’s hit a soft spot. Keep fighting the good fight mate."
unpopularopinion,ffsy52t,t1_ffsbgdf,1580197383.0,Then obviously the point of this post has completely missed you champ!!
unpopularopinion,ffsjdk6,t1_ffsbwtp,1580183139.0,Imagine thinking this was directed at them or even adding such a useless point in the first place... just imagine.
unpopularopinion,ffsbakj,t1_ffsb8hi,1580177631.0,"Nothing worth having, ever is!!"
veganfitness,ffsa04m,t1_ffs96ig,1580176768.0,"Cheers for that mate. Thank you. I’ve always had my oats, protein powder and water for breaky but I’m thinking I now need to add more to it.

I find I’m really hungry a lot and also a bit flat."
veganfitness,ffs11f8,t1_ffrkzoe,1580170533.0,"I just put a post up asking for what people’s diets look like. Can’t wait to watch this video after work..
What’s your weight roughly, if I may ask?
I’ll be trying to keep around 85-88kg.
Looking awesome my man. And thanks in advance."
ausents,ffretou,t3_eupz4x,1580156643.0,"Every.single.post these days “ItS pGr”

MuayThai,ffpp8d4,t1_ffknknl,1580101002.0,"Thank you for your kind words mate. 
Hahaha, knowing him, I’m probably doing something wrong hahaha. Love the man but he was a hardass."
MuayThai,ffpp5w8,t1_ffpbrzs,1580100941.0,You sounded like you could’ve been Aussie in one of your last messages. I’m planning a trip to the states again later this year. Hopefully I can come support one of your fights.
MuayThai,ffpp144,t1_ffo63k7,1580100826.0,"Thanks mate. Hit like a ton of bricks. We all thought he was invincible.. if you knew him(which it sounds like you did) you’ll know that wether he was a close mate or just passed by you at a show, he left such a strong impact on anyone and everyone he met.
Thanks for the kind words."
MuayThai,ffpoue7,t1_ffpbrzs,1580100665.0,"Go get it my man!! It sounds stupid but to do something, you have to eventually start doing it!! Don’t give me that hopefully hahaha. Come back and tell me how you smashed the tournament!!How long have you been training for?"

FortniteCompetitive,ffo283b,t1_ffnwref,1580073424.0,"Some of these people that comment need to carry a little plant around with them, just to replace the oxygen that they’re stealing.. 

You’re doing the right thing my man. We’re all thinking it. You’re the one that finally spoke up!!"
MuayThai,ffnul5r,t1_ffk630o,1580071037.0,"Mate. I’m so sorry to hear that. My deepest condolences to you and your family.
If you don’t mind me asking, Where are you based at brother?"
FortniteCompetitive,ffntyav,t1_ffn2ujf,1580070784.0,"I get what you’re saying brother. Most people will agree as well. There’s also a lot of people on here replying, just to have an opinion or opportunity for a slight flex(GeT bEtTeR etc)Not that’s it’s any good of an opinion either, it’s just so they can have an opinion. 
Keep fighting the good fight!!"
FortniteCompetitive,ffnsoz3,t3_eu8ogf,1580070274.0,Are you my team mate? Literally have this exact conversation daily!! He’s forever complaining about kids fighting out of zone.
MuayThai,ffk53ne,t1_ffk4nb3,1580016145.0,"You’re right brother and cheers for the kind words.
It’s something you can’t really explain and I have so much trouble understanding. You’re absolutely right and that’s all I hang onto are the lessons, words and memories. He was a great man, in every sense of that word. 
This year I’ve been getting my health back in check for a return and hopefully start honoring his memory the right way!! Perhaps learn to fight for me and not someone else.
Thank you for taking the time to message. Much love."
MuayThai,ffk3dk4,t3_eu2bl7,1580014563.0,"Three years ago my trainer passed away suddenly.
This was our last fight we had together and I’ll be forever grateful we finally got that belt TOGETHER. I’ve since fought without him. He passed a few days out from a big fight. I managed to take that win and I’ve won some amazing titles and fought in some even more amazing places since his passing.  I unfortunately don’t think I’m the same as I was with him and my career is basically non existent now.. our trainers can be so much more than that title. Azza was my father, my mentor, the one that put me in my place and my guider through every tough situation. Love your trainers people, cherish every moment(even the shittest) because it still is as shit, three years on."

offmychest,ffdnz0y,t1_ffdl7oa,1579824927.0,"This is the time for your country to shine. Trump and Hillary shouldn’t even be in question this time round but still we watch and we wait because there’s the chance that the people screw themselves over.... again.

I’m from Aus and we have a literal idiot in charge of our country. Scott Morrison is a muppet and doesn’t have a good bone in his whole body. Same is said for Hillary and Trump. I really hope the people fight for what’s right for your country.."
offmychest,ffdl1r5,t1_ffczid7,1579823138.0,"On that note, is Hillary really someone you want as your president?"
offmychest,ffd7ern,t1_ffczid7,1579814873.0,"Mate, to a certain extent, the people need to take responsibility. Nobody would even get a chance to become president without first having support from the people. You personally may have the best of intentions. Just saying that there’s a whole world watching the country as a whole."
Colts,ff86q3j,t1_ff7xbjn,1579667551.0,"That’s the spirit mate!! If only your team had that same belief and determination that you have.
P.s.. I hope you know this is all a laugh right now. Much love brother. Happy to keep the banter up though hahaha."
Colts,ff7uf1l,t1_ff7ozbc,1579658614.0,"Is it though?  It’s been a while for you boys. I understand why it’s easy for you to hang onto past achievements. Especially since it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen again. Not anytime soon at least.
66 years for the faults(I mean colts) and 20 years for the Texans!! We have plenty of time brother."
Colts,ff7o2df,t1_ff7nizf,1579654182.0,10 years ago mate. 10 years ago you did that!! 6 years ago you won the division. When’re you gonna stop living in the past hahaha. Achieved much in that time?
Colts,ff7nfm9,t1_ff7l4mr,1579653736.0,"Just again and real quick. You can talk that shit but where did you end in comparison to us?
I guess you guys should take all the wins you can get. Not having much luck on the field hahaha.
Before you say “We BeAt YoU gUyS tWiCe” we still finishes at the top of the division and where did you guys place? That’s the real question you’re dodging."
Colts,ff7kzef,t1_ff7kimf,1579652039.0,"Again, where did you guys place?! Not the journey brother but the destination. Our destination was SIGNIFICANTLY better than yours. We lost a few games but still ended up at the top of our division. Just remind me where you guys placed? It’s easy to forget the teams below us. I apologize for that."
Colts,ff7k7dx,t1_ff7d5al,1579651496.0,You guys literally sucked that hard you didn’t even get a chance to play in the playoffs hahaha. Let that sink in mate. We may have lost but you’re talking shit without even having the chance to be in the position we were. Take your salty ass elsewhere hahaha.
Colts,ff7d1zb,t1_ff2neeg,1579646736.0,Real quick mate. Did you make it to playoffs? Serious question. All good to y’all that shit but your team can’t even back it. That must suck.
GamersRiseUp,ff7c8ji,t3_erviy5,1579646166.0,"What a f*cking legend!! These people would never survive a day in Australia... I walked into work this morning and greeted “hey Cunt, what’s happening?” A word only has the meaning YOU put behind it. If you choose to find it (and nearly everything in this world) insulting, that’s what it always will be. Don’t be so delicate and let a word ruin your day."

Simmer down princess."
Colts,fewvdmy,t3_env9zz,1579420078.0,Y’all make it to playoffs or nah?! Serious question.
Whatcouldgowrong,fewur0i,t1_fewpa69,1579419796.0,Thanks mate. I was also thinking rubber bullets but thanks for clearing that up. thought maybe we’d see some blood on the shirt. I learnt a little something today about 9mm gunshots. Cheers

wwiipics,fefwttl,t1_fefgusw,1579067801.0,"Hold up one second... 

You’re trying to make it sound like war IS important. No. All of the lives lost and families/homes/lives destroyed... that’s important.
War will never be important or needed.

Should you or your friends/family have to die in someone else’s war? Hell no!!! War is not important.

About this picture though.. This speaks a million words. Biggest thing I took take away, is that we’re all human. Enemy or not, that’s a life gone and there’s nothing but respect."

Paranormal,fecgg41,t3_eof6vg,1578973318.0,"It’s so hard to think that there’s anything after life. I want to, with every part of me I want to..  

For this to happen, that would mean that every single living being EVER would have an after life?
I can’t wrap my head around the possibility that EVERY single person that’s ever lived and passed is..... where? And every person to come to pass will be there with them?
Every living being from every other planet will be there? Every living being to be on earth will be there? How will we all communicate.

I miss those I’ve lost so much. I’d give anything for there to be something afterwards for them, to see them again.. It just seems to good to be true. the time I was fortunate enough to have spent with them has to be cherished and remembered, that’s all we have.

This plagued me daily but it’s also only my individual out look on this topic."
