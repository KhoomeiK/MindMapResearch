I think it's a very pertinent question whether the founders were white supremacists regardless of whether other nations were.  In our schools we are taught that America is a fundamentally good country (American Exceptionalism), the fathers were just, liberty loving people, and the constitution, as a result, is a good, pretty much flawless document.  Analyzing ideological areas where the fathers held abhorrent views (i.e. on the inherent savagery of blacks and native americans) can help break down this mythology, and lead to some serious, substantive criticism of the constitution and America.

But yeah no, western civilization isn't uniquely evil, that's absurd.  And no serious leftist believes this.

That's not coming from a place of thinking that regimes like Iran are better than America, no serious leftist believes that, they just believe that having poles of resistance to US imperialism can allow for sovereignty, and allow alternative systems to flourish.  

For example, look at Yugoslavia, a country that a lot of democratic socialists see some good things in.  The USSR hated it because it wasn't subservient to them and allowed for worker control of factories and the use of market mechanisms, which they saw as dangerous (it should be pure state control).  The US hated it because it was socialist.  But neither imperial power (yes I believe the USSR was an imperialist nation, I think most leftists admit that too) fucked with Yugoslavia that much, because doing so would drive it closer to their enemy and potentially cause a conflict.  So having opposition to the dominant superpower led, in no small part, to the non aligned movement, which allowed alternative systems to be experimented with (to a certain extent).

What your glib post also ignores is that a lot of leftists just don't think that the US invading, killing another million + people like they did in Iraq and installing some group like the MEK ([https://theintercept.com/2017/07/07/mek-iran-rajavi-cult-saudi-gingrich-terrorists-trump/](https://theintercept.com/2017/07/07/mek-iran-rajavi-cult-saudi-gingrich-terrorists-trump/)) would be better for the Iranian people than the extremely flawed quasi-parliamentary system that exists currently (although it's undemocratic and hamstrung by a religious extremist group no leftist would support).  So believing that diplomacy is a better alternative (i.e. the kind of diplomacy that was making headway and bolstering the fortunes of the moderate Iranian government under Rouhani until Trump exploded that and ruined his credibility with the Iranian people) also doesn't equate to support for the most hardline elements of the Iranian government.

1. We have attacked Iran numerous times, so by that logic they have every right to retaliate against us.
2. A group of protesters with pro Iran leanings (not at all uncommon in a majority shiite country which just expelled our troops today because we fucked with Iran) attacked the US.  If you think that any protest group with sympathy for a country should be counted as being an attack by said country, then Iran should be justified in its retaliation against the US for the protests it's been experiencing that are occasionally violent and pro us.  Also, do you know what this protest was about?  It was about the US killing paramilitaries associated with the Iraqi state.  So if anything that aggressiveness is justified...  
If you believe the Trump admin propaganda that Iran was somehow masterminding that whole thing  without seeing any evidence of it, especially after we saw how Iraq was falsely justified, you're a gormless rube.

What negative freedoms do liblefts want to remove that libright would preserve?  Because most of the right wing bogeymen like guns, free speech, free religion, etc. that conservatives hurl at socialism aren't applicable to anarchism.  Anarchism is arguably the largest proponent of negative rights: you should be free from all coercion and hierarchy that isn't strictly socially necessary, and you should have some power over how all the necessary hierarchies function.  

If you just mean that they believe in communal ownership of capital vs private I don't see how that's any different than what capitalism does.

Because most of the right wing bogeymen like guns, free speech, free religion, etc. that conservatives hurl at socialism aren't applicable to anarchism.  Anarchism is arguably the largest proponent of negative rights: you should be free from all coercion and hierarchy that isn't strictly socially necessary, and you should have some power over how all the necessary hierarchies function.  

If you just mean that they believe in communal ownership of capital vs private I don't see how that's any different than what capitalism does.

imaginarymaps,fdaz0nu,t1_fdasekw,1578251984.0,"iirc they all had jewish ancestors but were not practicing jews (I believe all were atheists).  How people see Judaism (as a religion or as an ethnic group) has varied a lot across space and history, but I don't think any of those people saw themselves as having a particular kinship with the jews because they weren't religious.  Marx even had that famous quote about religion being ""the opium of the people"", and both Marx and Engels used some antisemitic tropes in their debates with a jew.  

Now none of this is to say that any of these thinkers were (uniquely) antisemitic (by the standards of their time, even if we see these attacks as deplorable now) or that this is some sort of original sin on what would later be known as ""Marxism"".  In fact I think if you compare Lenin's views on antisemitism to those of almost any other leader in the west and certainly in the former Russian empire you'd find that he had some of the most tolerant views on Judaism, homosexuality, etc.

I think it's interesting to realize how much the idea of Jewishness as an ethnic group and not merely a religious expression is a modern idea from around the beginning of the 20th century (Henry Ford, Protocols of the elders of zion, Naziism, certain elements in the eugenics movement, etc).  Compare for instance the persecution of the jews by christian kings and the church in the middle ages vs the holocaust.  Both were awful, clearly, but the former only killed jews who didn't convert.  There was nothing stopping someone who had all jewish ancestors converting and no longer having any connection to judaism, really.   Compare this to the logic of the nazis (and people like Henry Ford, i believe), which is that they were an inferior race and thus couldn't be a part of the new, superior german ethno-national state.  So remember too when you hear people criticize Marx and Engels for antisemitism, while it wasn't right it also wasn't the antisemitism of the nazi who thinks you're irredeemably, innately wrong, in this case it was possible that they just thought all people who held religious beliefs were morons and Marx was a chronic shitposter, just being a giant asshole to everyone who had even marginal ideological disagreements with him"
