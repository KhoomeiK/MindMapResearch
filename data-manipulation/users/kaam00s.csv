I'm being lectured about the culture of this sub by newcomers from last week with authright flair or unflaired, it's like a big joke. 

Have fun with this, this sub is the next r/GamersRiseup well see this in the next week."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflyigu,t1_fflxhdh,1580045770.0,"There is definitely more than those, I just didn't check everyone of them, just the most upvoted or downvoted who appears first. 
Why would this post attract people from r/politics? You didn't answer this question and you're just trying to diverge on numbers. 
If we go by numbers we can talk about the hundreds of people who upvoted the comment about baboons."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflxqym,t1_fflwvba,1580045501.0,"So why are you pushing the narrative if it's fake? 

The people lecturing us about ""people who ruin the sub"" Are newcomers, have you ever seen something like that before? No because everyone is welcomed to join in. Only the newcomers are against it. And these newcomers are authright pushing the narrative that left wing immigrants are invading."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflwhwu,t1_fflw1w2,1580044990.0,"The fake enemy being libleft and a "" sub immigrant"", i really wonder who made this up."

Scary immigrants with libleft opinions, everyone rally against them ! 

How does it work everytime ?"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflvqop,t1_fflvhtc,1580044764.0,"Why is it a problem if libleft join in then ? 

you said ""I don't have much of a problem with it"". 

This is not how this sub was made."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflvgt3,t1_ffltw6j,1580044632.0,"N word comments are not the only racist ones, comparing african to baboons who steal stuff (a libright did this), or comparing africans to humanoid apes (an authright wrote this), is actually far more racist ! You're obviously pushing a narrative."
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffluly6,t1_fflthlv,1580044429.0,"I'm here since the beginning, creation of flairs are like yesterday compared to that, and i've also made a lot of post here, i have top post from 7 months ago. Every ancient users here noticed the same thing, since when are we against people joining in if they flair up ? this is a takeover, whether you like it or not. But an unflaired trying to diverge attention from him, how surprising."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflu7pe,t1_fflt3x6,1580044262.0,Because it's against libleft people ? So you want to change the culture of this sub by forbidding libleft people to join ?
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffltvyd,t1_fflikgj,1580044145.0,"Wich situation, can you actually provide us source about the so called r/politics circlejerking ? 

This whole thing is a narrative pushed by actual newcomers who don't know the culture of this sub, before this we've never been against anyone joining in, the only rule is to flair up. 

You're certainly also a newcomer by reading you, nobody who's here since a year is pushing this narrative."

The post about african animals with a ton of n word using unflaired kids who made it to r/all certainly brought libleft from r/politics here /s. Totally logical !"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflqiko,t1_fflpn5a,1580042793.0,"none at all /s 

It's the direct frontpage, but every authright who ever came on reddit avoided it instinctively /s"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflpypa,t1_fflpja1,1580042673.0,"> because the sub is more tolerant now? 

What ? 

But people from libleft joining in are invaders ? you're not even honest with your narrative, why is there authright people who are here since a week lecturing us about the culture of this sub and how libleft are a danger for it ?"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflpjsc,t1_fflohbo,1580042505.0,"So tell me u/MinorityPrivilege why would it be paranoid to say that this narrative is made up ? How can a post who made r/all about african animals with a ton of unflaired people writing the n word (who flaired up since it was made) attract people from r/politics ? 

It really doesn't make any sense at all, this sub used to be mostly libleft people, they were a giant majority and everything was fine, why would newcomers from libleft be so bad ? It doesn't make any sense, especially since a quick check shows that newcomers are mostly from authright or authcenter. Really i'm asking you to be honest just this one time."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflog8t,t1_fflo376,1580042119.0,"I'm from the left you idiot, don't you see my flair ? But i'm on this sub since a year.

You on the other hand, supposedly joined reddit in january 22, or maybe you just did a secondary account to post here, who are the real invaders of the sub ? I really ask people with a brain to check this out."

If you're honest, despite being authright, you clearly noticed it aswell right ?"
dataisbeautiful,ffln1us,t1_fflilja,1580041650.0,"You're easy to influence, most newcomers are from the right wing and created a fake narrative about r/politics

PoliticalCompassMemes,fflmras,t1_ffll7j5,1580041511.0,"That's why i'll be downvoted. Don't expect this post to have more than 50% upvote. We are actually raided by authright people, I'm starting to actually believe it."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflmml1,t1_ffllchb,1580041443.0,"This is how it always works, i've seen this multiple time, i'm a boomer of the internet  lol, always the same narrative about left wing people migrating and ruining the culture of the sub. You can be sure that it's fake 100%, if we start asking for proof they will create account of libleft and post fake memes, creating themselves the ""proof"", it happened on a lot of subs. It's over, they are the senate now. You can trust me, this sub will change a lot in the next weeks. 

It already changed a lot in the last month if you were here for a long time you realised it.

Most people talking about the culture of the sub are here since less than a month if you check it."
dataisbeautiful,ffllsog,t3_eu5ljt,1580041218.0,"There was a recent invasion by authright people, who then pretend that r/politics user are invading, yet another propaganda about scary immigrants, that nobody saw, this sub used to be mostly libleft users, they were probably more than 60% at the beginning, but then a pretty racist post about ""african animals"" with a bunch of kids writing the n word made it to r/all so it attracted... people from authright, yet this sub think it attracted people from r/politics for whatever reasons. 

I really admire right wing people talent for invasion, it happened in less than a week and the narrative of the sub is now in their hands, they even state whether someone follow the culture of the sub or not despite being there for less than a month. People on the left probably should take example there, because it's really dominant. 

Source : I was there when this sub was created witch, and i made a ton of post there."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflifn9,t1_ffleoky,1580039992.0,"Also some kids who don't understand what the flair really means, like the one libleft kid drawing those ""be cool with authright"" even tho nobody attacked authright recently, and then drawing ""r/politics you are not welcome here"" drawings.

If you really didn't see the shift in population, you're a newcomer aswell or maybe you just changed your flair to shit on me.

PoliticalCompassMemes,fflepyw,t1_fflclqc,1580038756.0,"That has to be the most fake statement i've seen... the people who have an authright flair are very new, if it was people who changed their flair they would still have their ancient comments or post from months ago."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflemcz,t1_fflcxmt,1580038690.0,"Man, the worst is that they weren't here before, they invaded us this week, after the african animal thread, why would any r/politics people be attracted by this sub if the post who made r/all is a racist post ? it doesn't make any sense, they invaded us and now they are trying to make even the most ancient left wing people be considered invaders from r/politics, imagine that one of them treated me of invader, i've been here for a year...

PoliticalCompassMemes,fflefk6,t1_ffld4cb,1580038564.0,"It will be, the invaders are from authright dude, just check all the newcomers flairs, check the most upvoted thread, do you remember when libleft used to be the majority ?"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflatb6,t1_ffl8kno,1580037257.0,"Yes they are the real invaders, they came because of the African animals thread (the one who became one of the most upvoted post of the sub), a lot of unflaired people posted on it racist thing, and now you go watch it and they've all flaired up to authright. 

Perfectly knowing that they were invaders, they tried to put the light elsewhere, on a supposed libleft invasion, using the Scary immigrants propaganda is how authright always thrive."
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffl9i45,t1_ffkdr3w,1580036800.0,"Actually we've been invaded by authright and Authcenter, if you really were on this sub since a long time you'd have noticed this. 

This whole r/politics thing is a propaganda from authright, scaring us about immigrants again. 
While in reality, this sub used to be a majority of libleft, and now if you check the flairs you'll see more libright, authright and Authcenter. 

The newcomers from authright are now the ones judging if people follow the culture of the sub or not, so have fun now. Did you really see anyone from r/politics?

All I saw is that a clearly non ironically racist post about African being animal became one of the most upvoted post of this sub ever, and that people complaining about the authright invaders were downvoted to oblivion, then the authright use a reverse propaganda method. 
I've been on this sub since the beginning and used to post a lot of memes, check authright people post, most of them are here since a week or 2."
