television,ff1gw53,t1_ff0zaa4,1579479030.0,"Californians are Americans too. Each person’s vote should matter and be weighted equally. Why does the vote from 1 statesman matter/weight 4x more than the vote from another statesman? That is not democracy.

Presidential elections should be a popular vote. Not this electoral college bullshit."
ChoosingBeggars,ff0apuk,t1_ff05gjc,1579466938.0,I guarantee you a good chunk of those sob stories were fake and from people looking to turn a profit on free items. So don’t feel too bad.
news,ff08dqo,t1_fezczwg,1579466245.0,"They are also the only mammal with electroreception, which is the ability/sense (much like how we have the sense of taste, touch, smell, etc) of electroreception. Electroreception allows them to use/sense electrical impulses which they use to hunt for fish hidden under sand or navigate in the dark. Sharks have this sense too.

Imagine if humans evolved with this 6th sense. Our physical understanding of life would change, religions would change, cultures would change, maybe even language and how we communicate with others. so much would change."
BeautyGuruChatter,fewbl7g,t1_feuh4og,1579408001.0,If I saw these cloud bags at goodwill I wouldn’t buy them. They look like a kid’s messy school project. The clouds don’t even look...natural? They just look weird and tacky.
Wellthatsucks,fep2f7r,t3_eq6axj,1579310621.0,"I once had a license plate for ~8-11 yrs that read something like “6BLKMN”/“3BRNM3N” (Eg “6 black men”/“3 brown men”). It was subtly racist but conformed to my race so I didn’t really care, and you didn’t really realize it unless you really thought about it. Plus I didn’t want to bother with getting new plates.

Those prison inmates can get pretty inventive with their license plate numbers."
