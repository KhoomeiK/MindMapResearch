If I had to guess I'd say takeoff is the most frequent place of incidence since the low altitude makes the plane more susceptible to bird strikes, and the low air speed makes gliding not so great. But still great to have the option.

SS will have a lot of engines, but last time I looked into it I found the redundancy is mostly of benefit to cargo launches, as most of the engines are not even used for landing. I haven't been active lately and my memory is terrible, so correct me if im wrong, but I believe three of the center raptors on SS are critical for safe landing, where as planes don't have any specific ""critical"" engines, as they use control surfaces instead of thrust vectoring.

I do want to be optimistic about E2E, but it is by FAR the most optimistic goal from spacex. Spacex has definitely changed the game when it comes to affordability, but the haven't really shown me any reason to believe they can revolutionize safety to the required level for commercial Earth travel.

Yeah, different breeds have been bred for different uses, hence why my retriever always carries something in her mouth and why sheep dogs nip at feet and why something like a german shepherd is more prone to aggressive behaviour. Aggression is a positive trait in defensive dog.

Certain dog breeds like pitbulls, and German shepherds have natural predispositions towards being more defensive and protective, so they require less to be aggressive. 

Other breeds like wolfdogs are less obedient by nature thereby more dangerous.

Other genetic predispositions draw certain breeds into things like hunting, retrieving, farming, etc. The dogs I'm refering to are used for protection due to their predispositions. 

Do you think this line of thinking is a dangerous myth? I think the actual dangerous line of thinking is believing that giving everyone a pitbull is ok because they're perfectly safe when they are not.

Straws are just utensils like a knife or fork, plastic knifes and forks are complete ass. Getting rid of all disposables is good, if not for the environment then simply to go against the stupid consumerism that is pushed on us."

I know almost nothing about Australia but I do know in other parts of the world forest fires have very much become a necessary part of the environment."

I'm not super familiar with aussie geography but there's probably millions of people that have been inhaling this garbage. It's really sad."

personalfinance,fdqj6bl,t1_fdqg3an,1578667968.0,You must get a pretty sick deal on that dog food. Much cheaper than what we have access to over here!
personalfinance,fdqirq2,t1_fdqf0gb,1578667689.0,"I've always been a dog person, but then my parents got a cat and I realized just how.... easy they are. Honestly, my parents live in a nice neighborhood in a safe country, they could probably just crack the window open and leave the cat there for weeks. She might even be happier alone."
personalfinance,fdqibfo,t1_fdqghhz,1578667375.0,"It's an added expense, not the only expense."
personalfinance,fdqi3ql,t1_fdqgsp2,1578667226.0,"Depending on the dog, probability of never having another vet visit is extremely low. Just from my own subjective experience owning three flat coated retrievers over the last 18ish years, they will need medical attention more frequently than humans since they are a lot more physical and retarded, most dog breeds also have genetic issues which need to be dealt with from time to time, flat coats for example are prone to ingrown eye lashes which need a vet visit occasionally. Stub nose dogs like pugs can barely even breath on their own so I'm sure they have loads of vet bills."
personalfinance,fdqhm73,t1_fdqh0bh,1578666880.0,"Yeah it's down to the distinction. Our dog is a core member of our family at this point, whereas our cat spends most of her time outside, diet consists mostly of wild rodents and is very much a cold hearted creature of nature, we've already lost one cat to the wild and this cat has nearly been taken out a couple of times. She's just a wild animal whom we have the privilege of observing, and I probably wouldn't put in any significant vet bills into her, plus we get them for free from our local farmers."
