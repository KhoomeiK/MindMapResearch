It depends. If the need is there to spend everything now for survival, immediate shelter, putting out bushfires, then it needs to be spent now.

What do you even mean by this? The way I see it there are two types of people here: (1) right wingers who both disagree with her climate change argument and dont like her general attitude and (2) people who agree with climate change but just find her persona and dramatic methodology annoying. Which one are you referring to? Because if you are talking about (2), then we are not ""more fucked than we already are"" because the people who believe in climate change arent going to suddenly become climate deniers just because of a harmless but slightly annoying teenager. So suppose you are referring to type (1). Are you really suprised that right wingers who deny climate change, never listened to scientists etc are the type of people who would have listened to a dramatic teenager who says the exact opposite of what they emotionally believe in?"

I have seen and know a lot of people who agree with her overall message (as in they were always in agreement and not because of her) but just find her annoying and not a good face for climate change in general.

facepalm,ff52627,t1_ff4wlho,1579578194.0,"> How is that far too generous of an interpretation? 

Well words have meaning and if the OP used ""There's no reason for anyone"", we are entitled to assume they chose those words for the meaning it carried UNLESS its a commonly or obviously used hyperbole (eg ""Ive told you a million times""). In this case, how do you know that the OP is not being absolutely genuine? Are you absolutely sure that Tumblr is incapable of showing edgy, extreme and ""progressive"" comments like this? In fact, Tumblr is often known for extreme remarks like this. So for us to assume that this comment excludes professional and personal scenarios (which make up for probably over 50% of all social interactions we have day to day), its a big assumption.

&#x200B;

>If you're 22 and are hanging out and surfing/skateboarding with a 17 year old, that is weird. 

First of all, we are not talking about people hanging out with each other. We are talking about someone younger than 18 having a ***conversation*** with someone older than 21. Im assuming you have neither surfed or skated which is probably why you think its weird. Many kids from varying age go to their local surf beach to surf and end up hanging out or at least have conversations with people in similar age groups. Same with skateparks.

>message is so obvious

How is it so obvious? What is it about that sentence or the words used that makes it so obvious? There is nothing that makes it impossible or unlikely nor is it a commonly exaggerated sentence. If I was making an argument about a highly controversial opinion and something with significant impact to society, I would expect it to be made with precise and clear language.
