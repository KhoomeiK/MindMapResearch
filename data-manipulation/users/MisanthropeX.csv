I get it about weekly. 

I do not use delivery."

nyc,ffplwwn,t1_ffploxi,1580098305.0,"Raimi's Spider-Man is the ""first post 9/11"" film: to the point where the teaser trailer prominently featured the Twin Towers and had to be hastily edited. Awkward scenes of Spider-Man in front of the American flag when he was never really portrayed as particularly patriotic and that scene of ""New Yorkers coming together in the face of tragedy"" paint a really interesting picture of the summer immediately following 9/11."

Star Wars and Indiana Jones were respectively massive homages to serialized space opera and adventure films to the point where they have eclipsed their inspiration as the definitive and canonical examples of said media in the eyes of America, if not the world."

television,ffoz62q,t1_ffktszr,1580083572.0,"Hot take: it's not the producers' fault for casting a white woman. It's Mamoru Oshii's fault for drawing Matoko like a white woman and, overall, the anime industry's fault for drawing everyone with European features (contrast the supposedly ethnically Japanese [Sailor Venus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Sailor_Venus_01.jpg) from Sailor Moon with [Kenzo Tenma](https://static.zerochan.net/Tenma.Kenzo.full.648894.jpg) from Monster, who looks much more like a regular Japanese man."

television,ffoxn21,t1_ffjb1q5,1580083092.0,"> Please, teach me how to act like an ethnicity. 

You are aware that's like... a big part of acting right? Getting things like accents, dialects and culture-bound mannerisms down (for instance, whether shaking your head laterally means ""no"")"

AmItheAsshole,ffoobyx,t1_ffn81v9,1580079887.0,Counterpoint: No adult is going to a place like this on their own. Everyone who comes there is already a family. Kids' meals would be ordered there because they're a captive audience; if that location is heavily discounting kids' meals they're bad at fucking business and don't understand the type of establishment they're running nor their clientele.

dndnext,ffo3bti,t3_eu7xf6,1580073650.0,"If I had to hazard a guess:

Most whales are passive creatures who would be disinclined to attack human(oid)s. Most statblocks are for ""monsters"". Few games also take place underwater where you'd encounter a whale: if you were to encounter one it's likely that it wouldn't interact with you and therefore wouldn't need a statblock. 

If you absolutely needed a whale I'd say take the stats of a Brontosaurus and give it a swim speed"

RedLetterMedia,ffk5iye,t3_et1gac,1580016544.0,The original Cloverfield trailer was honestly pretty influential in the world of advertisement. We knew *nothing* about the film and the ARG was pretty new at the time.

OutOfTheLoop,ffiy4j4,t1_ffij9rg,1579985577.0,You have to understand that until relatively recently medical transitioning just wasn't possible. Crossdressing/drag/transvestitism was for a significant chunk of history the only way a trans person might even approach resembling their perceived gender.
