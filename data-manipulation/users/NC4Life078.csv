However, if they don’t allow witnesses they know that their 28-31% base will still most likely vote for them. 

The issue to me is the fact that people care more about “politics” than morals. I believe that independents are more acutely aware of this which is why an astounding 70% want to see witnesses.

They are pretty much ensuring they lose seats in any purple state. But they’ll still retain their base in the red.

As infuriating as this is I can rest easy knowing most independents will most likely vote against Trump in the upcoming election/s and both the House and the senate will turn blue giving, hopefully Bernie, the power he needs to make the necessary changes our country needs.

To sum it up:

Democrats: “Look at all the evidence of corruption, the Republicans say there’s no first hand knowledge yet they won’t agree to witness who have first hand knowledge”

Republicans: “the House should have done their job, the process is unconstitutional and the Democrats only want to impeach a president they don’t like”

I have an enormous amount of respect for Mitt Romney, I lost all respect for Cory Gardner. Susan Collins I feel is self motivated by her senate seat and I have no idea who the other Repub is. 

All this time I thought, how could the Republicans defend such corruption? How could they say: There’s no witness’ when people are trying to line up to testify? 

To me this isn’t about politics, this is about abuse of power, it would be no different than if it were a Democrat. Trust me, I have a hatred for the Clinton’s. 

And if the Republicans want to defend that abuse without hearing from key witness to make an informed decision than they all need voted out.

I love our country, but, a lot of these politicians are rotten to the core and only serve those with $ or themselves.

It was an interesting question Mitt and the 2 other senators had asked about duel motives. If it benefits you “and the country” is it considered “corrupt”? I think the issue is, it’s easy to construe how it “benefits the country” and someone like Trump probably sincerely believes him getting re-elected is a benefit to the country so a “Quid Pro Quo” is nothing more than foreign policy.

Furthermore Ukraine are our allies, that destroys our relationship on so many levels; not just with them but with other allies. Trump is a terrible human being and I’m sure, even without the senators saying it, they too believe so.

I quote:

“The Civil War is sometimes described as the last old fashioned, and the first modern, war. It was fought with the final generation of muzzle-loading percussion arms and artillery. These were at the apex of their development as well as other new technologies in the form of breech-loaders, repeating rifles (that used self-contained metallic cartridges) and, of course, the first Gatling guns.”

Why yes, weapons do become more effective at killing to your point, and at the pinnacle of their development at the time the founding fathers said we need to have a 2A and allow everyone to have these weapons.

When the founding fathers wrote that did they say; “We need limits”? No. Otherwise they would have wrote it at that time. It is those throughout the centuries that say their needs to be limits. Not the founding fathers. 

You then say: “No individual can be allowed to own something like a nuke, but every argument I’ve seen would allow that if taken to its logical conclusion.”

The amendment reads: “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”

Keep in mind that our US Supreme Court justices who protect the constitution have said the following regarding the 2nd Amendment:

“U.S.  Supreme Court (1939): In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a “shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length” at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.”

“U.S. Supreme Court (1997): In Miller, we determined that the Second Amendment did not guarantee a citizen’s right to possess a sawed off shotgun because that weapon had not been shown to be “ordinary military equipment” that could “contribute to the common defense.” Id., at 178. The Court did not, however, attempt to define, or otherwise construe, the substantive right protected by the Second Amendment.”

“U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (2007): The Amendment does not protect “the right of militiamen to keep and bear arms,” but rather “the right of the people.” The operative clause, properly read, protects the ownership and use of weaponry beyond that needed to preserve the state militias.”

Interestingly enough; many of these so called “Assault weapons bans” would most surely go against the Supreme Court as that could be ruled as “ordinary military equipment”

The U.S. Supreme Court has said otherwise, so to your point, no, not every argument would assume or end with that being a “logical” conclusion.

But yea keep using those fallacies in your reasoning, I’m sure it will help in continually figuring out how to give up your rights as an American and violate the constitution."

But yes, mute me, continue to live in your echo chamber because you don’t like the blatant facts that oppose your narrative. 

And guess what? 2A still stands. Fix mental health and poverty and you fix gun related violence.

If you can’t have a debate around facts, hearing both sides, I would appreciate it if “left” because there is no conversation to be had when you’re unwilling to listen."
politics,ffuw8bx,t1_ffuuiy0,1580250516.0,"Thanks for clarifying more precisely what I’ve already said. Yes, guns make suicide more lethal. There is no argument about this. 

But you also quote my point that I will stand by:

“People will kill themselves either way”.

You know what you do when you have someone who is suicidal? You have to watch them, often times with line of sight supervision. You have to take away loose fitting clothes, strings, sharp objects like knives and scissors etc. 

Why is this? Because they are at risk of suicide, and if given the opportunity, they will kill themselves if they’re suicidal. 

You can take guns away, but, those who are mentally ill will still be mentally ill and may find a bridge, a train, a car, a knife. Did you know in 2016 knives killed more people than AR-15s? 

Next, you can’t say “suicide is more culturally acceptable and that doesn’t prove your point” without actually stating any facts or debating what has been said. And actually Japan has made it their top priority years ago to combat suicide because it isn’t culturally acceptable. 

Furthermore you illicit the issue, “culture”. Despite having no guns, they kill themselves because of their *culture*. Which bring us back to, It is the people who are the issue, not the tool that’s used.

And all of these points are supported by research. Go look at the WHO, and the FBI Crime stats for 2016/2017 as that’s where my points are coming from.

Japan has like 14.3 suicides per 100,000 and the U.S. has like 13.6."
politics,ffuu5o6,t1_ffutsmk,1580249392.0,"Exactly, just another reason to keep supporting the 2A, very good point."
politics,ffuser4,t1_ffureb3,1580248471.0,"Of course. Just because I’m a gun owner and a strong advocate for the 2nd amendment does not mean I am against all regulations. There are specific things that could be done that would hopefully increase safety of our country without infringing on gun rights.

I do believe having adequate gun storage would prevent unauthorized access. If you’re worried about getting it out quickly during a home invasion, get a biometric safe, they’re cheaper than most guns.

But to say “take the guns”, “guns are the issue” is nothing more than a fallacy. It’s people that are the issue, and having a safe can prevent unauthorized access from people who shouldn’t have a gun.

But just like the amendment itself, their is a limit to what some may consider “safe storage”. It’s in the details that could then become the issue, people who aren’t familiar with guns may ask for ammo to be stored in a safe location away from the gun itself. In this case I will be the first to say no.

Just because I support the 2A doesn’t mean I don’t support other things.

And/ or give tax deductions and/ or credits for safe storage. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

Edit: I missed your other point regarding suicide. People will kill themselves either way. Japan with strict regulations on guns still has a higher suicidal rate than the US. Again it is the people and the culture that is the issue, not the guns. Guns are a tool. Lastly, yes, guns make it easier to follow through with suicide, but, hell some countries actually allow assisted suicide. Imagine if we did, how would this go down? Maybe it would maybe it wouldn’t. But we can’t negate how our policies around certain concepts play a large role in other areas."

Speed limits are in place because with the increased in speed there is a higher risk of death.

Furthermore, you entirely missed my point and cherry picked one sentence. Keyword, “my gun” a gun is nothing more than a tool, just like a knife, or a car. If I put a gun in an empty room and ensure it’s locked up and no one has any access to it, guess what? The gun will have done nothing more than sit there. Why? Because again it is not the gun, it is the person behind it. That is the issue, not the gun itself."

You say my statement is untrue? How about you do your own research:

https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91834&page=1

You then contradict yourself and say yes, but, it isn’t about race. In which case you’re missing the point entirely. If it’s about supply and demand; white babies are in less supply than black babies they have to increase the cost of white babies so that demand is lowered. Now, what does that tell you if white babies are so much in demand that the price for one is $30,000 and for a black baby it’s $4,000? How much more blatant does it have to be?

Next, just to think, because you’re white, you have a higher chance of being adopted, white privilege.

We could however then focus on the fact that there are more black babies to begin with than white babies (Despite only being 13.9% of the population) Why do you think this is? Better access to healthcare and contraceptives like birth control and the ability to be able to afford the cost of abortion, single mothers unable to raise their children because the lack of familial support and resources etc. the list goes on.
