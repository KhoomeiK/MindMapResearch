Please also consider that as an indie artist making music is now 50% of the job. You also need to endlessly engage the audience, create ads, shoot and edit videos, both candid and proper concept video clips for the songs, plan campaigns. It’s a massive expense of time, effort and resources and it doesn’t even involve “sitting down with a guitar” like someone else said around here.

You’re hurling high speed towards a totalitarian dictatorship. Your only hope of that not happening is to vote someone on the other side of the spectrum. 

You are so far off right that it’s impossible for the new government to substantially subvert the state of things. In other words you’d need  12 years of hardcore left wing legislation with complete acceptance from the house and the senate to end up with a quasi communist government, and that would be a mistake too.

I'm telling you why you should vote left at the next election:
The political spectrum is not a line that goes from left to right, it is a horseshoe and at the top of both sides you have totalitarism.
You guys are hurling towards the top of the right side and are a few bad decison away from a proper regime, with an untrustworthy character at the helm.
If you were to vote for a marxist (which BTW you don't have, your far left would have been considered center left a few years ago), at this specific moment you'd end up slighly left of the center.
I think the smart way to go would be to vote left and rebalance the situation and then use the following election to push it towards your preference. It's kinda like driving a train - you don't get an immediate reaction but simply counteract or second the inertia"

The real threat with google and FB is not that they collect your browsing patterns, etc. 
Their main source of income is scanning your communication looking for buzzwords that allegedly can help them target you with better ads. 

Unfortunately, if you use gmail for your communication you give them a wealth of info about yourself that their AI can scan and store. 

Example:

You had a heart attack and you’re mentioning that to your friend on an email. Now the system has that bit of info about you. 

In a couple years from now you want to buy health insurance from a provider. When they say they are running background checks what they are doing is buying bundles of data about you. The content of your communication can then influence the availability or price of that product.

Now think about all the info you are putting out there in your day to day communication and how all the little pieces give away more than you’d say yourself. WhatsApp is another culprit of that.

Ever since I made the switch, my life hasn’t changed much, but if anything I’m trying to limit what I can and try to not put all my eggs in one basket if that makes sense.
