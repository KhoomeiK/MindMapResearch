AskReddit,ff20xq9,t3_er742d,1579490860.0,"What a coward I was for never asking out the girl I liked since 3rd grade. Spent 3rd, 4th, half a semester in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade in the same school and never told her. Then we happened to be on the same field trip in 9th grade though we were in different schools. 11th and 12th grade she worked at the grocery store two blocks from my home. 
A friend who also knew her since elementary school tried to ask her out and she said her husband would not like that. But she turned to me and called me by my name. I felt good. And after I returned from basic training I saw her working at a grocery store near a different friend's house. The last time I saw her my friend and I were doing a beer run and she was pregnant.
Last night I had a dream where I wasn't a coward and let her know how I felt about her as a kid. Then in middle school she left the guy she dated then for me. I went to her high school and we were just happy. Really painful."

BoJackHorseman,few3094,t1_few0n6t,1579404734.0,"I always felt that it was because he always got away with it. Remember how he said in S5 that he was ok and found a way around by limiting the amount of alcohol but that failed. It took the rock bottom of him physically assaulting Gina. Even worse was that he didn't remember doing it. 
IRL it sucks that Tom Cruise shamed her just because his crazy ass religion works the way it does. One way that I've heard a celebrity attempt to stay sober is how the Texas Rangers had Josh Hamilton shadowed by an employed person to help him avoid the bad choices. It worked until of course it didn't."

The only reason I remember saying Bin Laden was because the year before my World History teacher covered terrorist acts and the WTC parking garage bombing was a part of that but he said Bin Laden had a part in that,  which apparently may be wrong. Also covered were the Ok City bombing and 96 Olympic scare. I remember thinking to myself at least shit like that won't happen anymore..."
