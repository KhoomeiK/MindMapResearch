Not as confident then, luckily i avoided too many fights.

Scariest part was of the late game was when I came to a bottleneck at a stairs room and an Aerodactyl used agility on itself and like 3 other pokemon. One more step forward and I'd have been fucked. That's what killed the last of my Attract pp."

MysteryDungeon,ffaqrog,t3_esfi5c,1579742297.0,"Need to get rid of linked moves too, they make the game too easy. You can kill Rayquaza with a level \~30-35 Skitty with Tailwhip/Tackle/Doubleslap and Attract and a bit of luck (Scary Face = game over). I get that Attract is/was broken as hell and is being addressed but that combo does WAY too much damage at the cost of a bit of belly and unless you get slowed, you can get in two link rotations for every one hit from him before renewing Attract and going twice again. 

At the very least have some sort of cool-down on them or possibly increased PP usage à la pressure to force you to dedicate more space in your toolbox for Max Elixirs to sustain them, or make it so the link breaks automatically if a Max Elixir is used and get rid of Link Boxes/make them rare as ginseng to reconcile that.

Also fix the broken wonder mail system, its basically built in cheat codes.

Perhaps have these in a hardcore mode for experienced gamers?
