wikipedia,fdly4om,t1_fdkxyc8,1578535278.0,"The problem with this logic is that the existence of unicorns can also be proved, because we also have an idea of what their evidence would look like - horses with a horn on its head. So we can't really say that something doesn't exist if we can't prove existence or non-existence. We can only say that we cannot know."

Some episodes were finished using the artists' cash. Just Google the problems with Toei. Besides, it doesn't need to be as stunning as a 13 episode season, but this has been consistently low quality for the size of one piece. It's wasted potential."
