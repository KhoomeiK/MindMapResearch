However, he did ask multiple times. And, afterward, he felt guilty because he probably wasn't sure himself if what he just did was rape or not.

'One thing led to another' is also not how people usually describe somebody forcing themselves on them.

And then there's the couldn't be arsed angle.  One could look at that and say that if you didn't care enough to say no, that that's basically consent.  Of course, this is also probably the wrong train of thought -- a major symptom of abuse IS coldness/apathy.

Honestly.  It sounds like he tried to be decent, both in the moment and afterward.

It sounds like this is a grey area.

It sounds like he is AS confused and upset as you are.

Showerthoughts,fgxg3uh,t3_f0s76t,1581172386.0,"...proving my complaint that there's not enough good sf being produced lately.

Sci Fi is meant to be based upon what is being discovered and theorized today, and in the near future...famous authors like Asimov, Serling and Dick got to the tops of their game by reading loads of scientific journals and keeping up with modern trends in science.

If sci Fi feels modern, or feels samey...then it's because writers and producers are out of touch with science.

It's certainly not because there's a lack of things to theorize about.

Kelly and Zach Weinersmith wrote a GREAT book called Soonish, each chapter of which could be a sci Fi novel, were the concepts explored in horrifying detail.

Sci Fi is about asking 'if x is true...then what?'. It's about exploring a universe that is different, because of some key paradigms central to the story or universe in question.

Today's series that seem to be doing it right include Black Mirror and the two recent Star Trek shows.  Stargate, Mass Effect and some aspects of Star Wars also seem sufficiently self aware.

I'm sure there are more...but it's just not as popular as it used to be.

TL;DR: Yeah, I agree, but that's mostly because as a civilization we are writing less and less sci Fi, and we don't seem to hold ourselves to the same standard of research as used to be SOP."

SO many British and Scottish folk wind up moving to Spain.  Cost of living is low, and a lot of the 'western' food is really just Indian and/or British pub fare.

I'd already spent 2 years in Scotland at that point, so it felt very familiar.  That like...mild yellow curry that the British invented because they can't handle real curry.

They put it on everything over there.  Chow mein.  French fries.  It has a comparably low cream content to 'real' curry too, so it doesn't hurt the lactose sensitive as much.

K.

Wasn't me, was a dude staying at my hotel.  We were in Ibitza, me, my boyfriend, his sister, their best friend.  We were coming back from a club.  We turned to go down an alley we had gone down a lot that week to hit up a chip n curry stall...and interrupted a hooker sucking off this guy in the alley.

Chris immediately goes ""ACCK!  SORRY!""  And we run about-face and walk away.

NOT TEN SECONDS LATER the dude in question comes running past us, his pants still around his ankles.  Chris' sister starts laughing, we turn, and the prostitute is already standing, one shoe has been dumped, the other shoe is in her hand like a dagger.

She lets out this, like, semi-feral cry of frustration and takes off after him, barefoot, wielding the shoe.

Dude glances back, yelps, and keeps running.

We...walked away, and got a curry and chips."

""Well, would'ja lookit that?!""  The speaker boomed.  ""I don' reckon we's got enuff fer TWO squares now, don'tcha think, ya'll?""

Simultaneously, all the girl-bots turned to face us, each playing a clip that giggled mischievously.  At precisely the same moment, every boy-bot turned to face us, each screaming an identical ""YEEHAW!"".  Hairs I did not know I had stood on end as my lungs turned to stone in my chest.  Somehow, I was feeling the complete terror of impending death AND the humiliation of one's first highschool dance, both at the same time.  As the lady-bots took a step toward me that was at once maternal and homicidal, this sensation took hold and spread roots of anxiety that throttled my heart, freezing me whole.

""C'mon, ya'll.  Don be shy!""  The speaker bellowed at us as one of the robots, dressed in the hooped wire skirt, closed a vice-like hand over my arm and steered me toward the centre of the room.  Around me, I could see Captain Knoss, as well as officers Erasmus and Morias, being similarly marched forward, into the square formation.  None of us were a match for the robots' strength, and in short order we found ourselves arranged in facing couples:  myself and a girl-bot facing the Captain with another girl-bot; Erasmus and Morias on either side, facing each other, both held in place by a boy-bot.  The other robots had taken up positions around the sides of the room and were clapping along to the speakers system, which appeared to be playing a gentle, twelve-second loop of somebody melodically saying ""oom-pah"".  On my right, staring straight ahead, the girl-bots' knees were bending as she bounced, down, up, down, up.  I would have needed the jaws of life to separate the robot's hand from mine, and yet its grip was delicate, aware of my every finger.  Erasmus was struggling frantically against the boy-bot, who stared ahead blankly, knees pistoning up and down, plastic smile immovable.  Knoss was...very focussed, looked as though one of his eyes could pop out.  Morias looked like she was going to pass out.  She leaned forward, hissing at me.

""What's going on?!""  she asked, from the right side of the shape.  I pursed my lips.  Some...thing about this was sickeningly familiar to me.  The coupled dancing.  The use of geometric shape and stilted movement.  The awful clash of loud clothing and irritating music.  The...whatever-it-was stirred against something dark and repressed inside of me.  Something from history class, pushed aside and forgotten because of how awful--my train of thought reached its conclusion at the exact same time as Captain Knoss.  We spoke in twin breaths, hardly daring to believe it.
