weddingplanning,ffeig1f,t3_et3tul,1579849309.0,We got married before the wedding for insurance and financial purposes with the added bonus of having a small intimate moment just the two of us (we have huge families and the wedding will be 200+ guests). My fiance's parents know and understand. I haven't told my parents because I know they would be very upset not to have taken part of the elopement.
weddingplanning,ffeiazo,t3_esuvne,1579849146.0,We're doing a modified head table with out family at long tables adjacent to either side of the sweetheart. All the other tables are round so it's still a place of honor while FH and I get our own table.

DIYweddings,ffam6jt,t3_eselqy,1579739207.0,You could buy the guitar pick hole puncher and make some out of a thinner plastic. Or purchase light picks for more bendability!
weddingplanning,ffam1w0,t3_esg9tc,1579739119.0,They all look fabulous but I think the simpler designs look phenomenal because they don't take away from the caplet and your beautiful face! Personal favorite is the middle and that cool fringe that seems to pull together the whole look!

beginnerfitness,ff2aeie,t3_er8c13,1579498618.0,"Make sure to do exercises that target different muscles in your arms. If you do all biceps work, for example, you will wear out quickly.

Also, by the end of your reps it should be hard but not so hard that you lose your form. If that happens, lower your weight. Lower weights and more reps will help you more than poor form and too much weight."

nursing,feyr53k,t3_eqsgcx,1579449597.0,Would it be less obvious to have a check box on the urine cup and a sign that indicates to read the instructions printed on the cup? I guess no one will actually read the cup though...
aww,fer0wcf,t1_fepgza0,1579348350.0,"In his prime, mine was 18 but in his old age, closer to 9/10. It's like humans where you lose muscle mass, etc."
weddingplanning,fer0pyl,t1_feq59sl,1579348271.0,This is only the second dress she tried on? I'm not even sure because she hasn't ever gone with me. And never gave her any requirements other than it's a formal wedding. I wanted her to find something she felt comfortable in but I never dreamed that she would pick something so similar to my gown.
weddingplanning,felvh3a,t1_felk5pb,1579231948.0,"I agree. I don't want to force her, but she won't change it unless I'm extremely firm. So here I am in this awkward situation."
weddingplanning,felvcjf,t1_felqxqf,1579231856.0,"That's my issue exactly. The silhouette the same would be fine! Or as someone mentioned in a comment, something that distinguished it like lace, etc."
weddingplanning,felv5lm,t1_felowqj,1579231719.0,"My Dad texted that there is lace on the top but I can't see it. I purposely put my bridal party in sequins to make a contrast between the simple classic look of my dress. She had tried on a gold dress too and said it ""wasn't mother of the bride enough"" so why this is alright I don't understand."
weddingplanning,feluyjm,t1_felr3gd,1579231579.0,"I have had my dress since October. She picked this out today. My father said ""I like the connection between mother and daughter..."". I think I'm more hurt by the fact that everyone is breezing over my feelings than the dress."

aww,fedo6pg,t1_fedn7rw,1579016242.0,"I was adopted through the State. I don't have legal rights to anything other than ""non-identifiable"" information (hair color, partial name, age, etc) of my birth parents. I would have to hire a lawyer and petition the courts with a valid reason to unseal my records. But my birth mother could find me if she wanted to. It's so frustrating."

weddingplanning,fed0q8c,t1_feclqwf,1578992863.0,"That was our initial thought as well. We did a test seal and then opened the invitation because we were worried about the seal completely tearing the flap. The texture of our invitations is a little bit slippery? It's not typical cardstock. For us, the seal either popped off or broke and left the invitation unharmed. I'd check what happens with yours before deciding!"
