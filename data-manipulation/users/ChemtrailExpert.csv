HVAC,ffb1vt5,t1_ff5sokm,1579749712.0,It wound up being a loose solder joint where the line run for the limit switches attach to the board so not too far off.  Replacing the board would have fixed it.  I’m gonna go that route because it’ll probably fail again soon if I just solder it.

HVAC,ff4fijv,t1_ff4ddlz,1579562378.0,I actually removed the part and tested on ohms because I had started seeing the control board led indicate an open limit switch when I knew the switch was physically closed.  I wasn’t sure if these are truly on/off switches or if they increase resistance as they heat up so I was experimenting a bit.
HVAC,ff4dcmh,t1_ff4cjtp,1579560937.0,"Whatever the failure is, it’s intermittent because I have it running with the original parts again..  it’s usually gone about 12 hours or so before it starts barking about open limit switches again.

HVAC,ff4cjtp,t1_ff4b58s,1579560421.0,"I used a multimeter..  

I also just completed the circuit with a fuse instead of an aux limit switch.  It’s still saying the limit is open.  The primary is on the same wire run as the auxillary from the control board, so it might be that but that’s gonna be a PITA to take out and check plus it seems way more important in preventing me from burning the house down so I’m gonna call a pro."
HVAC,ff4am8a,t1_ff47c8u,1579559177.0,"Yeah, I kept doing anything superficial I can.  The tstat wasn’t sending signal so I fixed that so now things are starting up.  the board is still saying the aux limit is popped.  I tested the switch and current is going through so I don’t see how it can be the issue.   this is beyond any skill set I have.  Gonna have an hvac guy out.  Really curious to figure out what it ends up being though."
