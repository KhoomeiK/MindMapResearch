PersonalFinanceCanada,ffiseei,t1_ffirq5q,1579981533.0,"Food under $4 only gets charged 5%. If it’s over $4, then you’re charged the full 13% HST.

So if you’re buying a $2 coffee, the total is $2.10.
A $3 muffin comes out to $3.15, so $5.25 in total.

But if you purchase the coffee and muffin together, it’s 5, plus HST= $5.65 in total."

fountainpens,fffrwob,t1_fffr58q,1579890469.0,"Ah, that makes sense. I’m not charged VAT since it’s leaving Europe, but our own customs are sometimes hit-or-miss whether they charge duty or not.

But even with VAT, Cult Pens have great prices and fabulous service."
fountainpens,fffqm80,t3_ete1at,1579889674.0,"I’ve had fantastic service from CultPens in the UK. Shipping is free if you go over £70, I think.

If you’re outside of the UK they won’t charge you VAT, so it’s even cheaper (though your own customs might charge you duty, so it might not make a difference).

My orders shipped out from them the very next day, and arrived in Canada in about 2 days. All for free. I’d recommend them any day.

Edit: check out the Diamine inks they sell, too. They’re ridiculously cheap."

It was the first one I bought about 6 years ago. It was about $8, and I kept going back to it in the store, wondering if I really should be spending that much on a pen, knowing I could get a bunch of free ones at work.

6 years later and we all know how that story ends."

TCK,ffaaf60,t3_esiu5u,1579731032.0,"Hi clairestreaks. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit of reverse culture shock. You sound like you’ve had a good experience living in many places, though, and you’re old enough to remember, so I don’t think you’ll be losing that part of your identity or become “ignorant”. 

I’m much older; in fact my own child is older than you, but I was also a TCK growing up and I’ve never lost that part of my identity. 

And yes, I do get some people asking where “X country” is, from time to time. Or asking what state it’s in. You’re still young though, so lots of time to keep traveling the world on your own too, someday, perhaps."

And as the others have said, this smells of love bombing for sure. Also check out /r/narcissisticabuse Loads of good advice there.

And finally, if he is a narc, it is NOT advisable to get marriage counselling. Narcissists are able to manipulate things their way, and you end up victimized all over again.
