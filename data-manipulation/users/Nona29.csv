TheMaskedSinger,fgugyu4,t3_f09xkk,1581120552.0,"The Fox, The Butterfly, and The Bee are my fave costumes. 

I haven't been impressed by Season 3 costumes yet. I'll wait to see the remaining groups perform"
TheMaskedSinger,fgugby9,t1_fgsu6zb,1581120102.0,The only costume that looks up to par so far is the White Tiger. Last season had some really nice costumes
ProdigalSon,fgl2x76,t3_eu3m2p,1580880346.0,It's a procedural you should not take too seriously...i love it!
ProdigalSon,fgl2fgj,t3_eybsba,1580879923.0,"She is a lot like her character in Scandal with the deep overdramatic voice changes and at first I was a little annoyed by her character.  

But now I'm totally into it and everyone really. One of the few shows where I like most, if not all, of the characters

I think the mother plays off well with Malcolm."
ProdigalSon,fgl23ue,t3_eye4ie,1580879642.0,Still loving this show. It's so bizarre and serious and yet so much fun.
ProdigalSon,fgl21fx,t1_fgka20w,1580879586.0,"Wow...I totally missed where it was going there. I knew it was something important like that but I didn't pick up the full context. 

I thought it was so cute how he reacted when he saw Dani in her dress. 

Also, she's so much taller than him. I love it!!"
ProdigalSon,fgl1ou5,t1_fghqtyj,1580879284.0,I know right...i just watched and laughed the whole way thru. I love that this show can poke fun at itself
TheMaskedSinger,fghgb9r,t3_eydw61,1580784175.0,The audience was truly wildin' out last night! I had never laughed so much at the audience before lol
MarriedAtFirstSight,fgewyho,t1_fg42wab,1580713269.0,His responses to things feel rehearsed and not genuine. I can never really tell how he genuinely feels about anything...I honestly don't think Michael was a good pick for this show
MarriedAtFirstSight,fgetiyw,t3_ey10wk,1580709459.0,"I don't know if it's a requirement but I do recall that for the last couple of seasons, the instagrams would be private. I assumed production tell them to make it private.  Once the season is over, they open their pages up and start posting freely about the show"
MarriedAtFirstSight,fgetc8x,t3_exlkgr,1580709267.0,"Yes! That look he gave her when she tried to approach him in the bathroom. The disdain was heavy lol

I would have never recovered from that full day of silent treatment and rudeness from someone I just met. 

He could have just calmly explained that he was caught off guard by waking up to the camera in his face. That it shocked him since he was coming out of his sleep and it took him a minute to realize what was going on. They could have squashed the issue quickly...

Then later on in the day, he was acting more normal when they were in front of the others. But as soon as they were back to being alone, he got nasty again.

If it took him literally all day to get over that one little thing, what's going to happen when they encounter bigger issues??"
TheMaskedSinger,fgesivr,t1_fgeo358,1580708459.0,"Yall I still can't believe he did this show... high and all! lol

But his voice is too unique to hide. And I can't believe Robin Thicke didn't hear it... they've collabed on so many songs!"
TheMaskedSinger,fgenwst,t3_exttfr,1580704372.0,This robot sounds sooo much like Lil Wayne ... but i can't even imagine him being on this show lol
cats,fg5seqj,t3_ewq9x1,1580537130.0,Omg I am seriously in love with this kitty!!!
relationships,ffyxfb8,t3_e7zyek,1580357593.0,I'm so sorry this happened to you! Did you ever hear from him again? I hope he at least gave you some closure
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffytsaw,t3_evyqti,1580354945.0,I took Austin's comments to be a definite YES.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffytntn,t3_evycow,1580354856.0,"I just think that Brandon may be quick to anger/getting upset. I wouldn't be surprised if we continue to see these types of outbursts and/or annoyances over things by him. 

If he is a truly anxious person, I can't imagine that being around a camera crew and a person who doesn't know him very well would help him cope with his anxiety.  

It's also not fair to expect Taylor to know how to handle his reactions when she doesn't understand why or what has happened to cause him to react this way."
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffysrsg,t1_ffyjxpo,1580354233.0,I'm not feeling him at all. Just doesn't seem warm or genuine and he's kinda bland.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffyrw2n,t1_ffyotk8,1580353623.0,It's good to have a balance of couples that have a real chance at romance and the other couples that bring the drama and make us come back for more ;-)
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffyrjfe,t1_ffylj3k,1580353379.0,PREACH!!! My experience as well in both personal and professional situations.
cats,ff57gr9,t3_erkg6c,1579582451.0,This is a gorgeous kitty!!!
Connecticut,fe5l19t,t1_fdzr1np,1578870805.0,I like this idea as well. Thank you!!
cats,fe0bet0,t3_engxac,1578808644.0,That's amazing! He looks so young!!!
Connecticut,fdzyuvs,t1_fdzo58t,1578799108.0,I also have not seen any store charge for paper bags.
Connecticut,fdzr8cm,t1_fdyt5vw,1578793940.0,I didn't think about those small trash bags.  I can get them cheap at the dollar store. Good thinking and thank you!
Connecticut,fdyo55p,t3_emue0c,1578781834.0,"Wow, you really attract a lot of bad drivers lol ;-)"
Connecticut,fdyn3ge,t3_emxrsp,1578781563.0,Gorgeous!!! Perfect scene for a jigsaw puzzle too ;-)
Connecticut,fdymul3,t3_encdyg,1578781471.0,"I surprisingly got used to the no ""plastic bags"" life when going out shopping fairly quickly. 

However, I'm running out of bags for disposing of my cat's 'goodies' from the litter box"
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdylwxv,t3_em36zr,1578781242.0,I know I was totally not into Austin AT ALL until wedding day. The way he did his vows and the way he acted with Jessica really made me view him differently.  I could start to see how someone could be interested and fall for him
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdyl7r7,t1_fds8b1k,1578780994.0,"When he said he had to have his xbox, I would have been done right then and there."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdyjw02,t1_fdx7u7u,1578780601.0,She was definitely more graceful than him. And some of his comments would have gotten a major side-eye from me.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdyj0ut,t3_en3pi1,1578780294.0,"Who says Taylor is perfect? She seems like a decent person who would be a good match for someone out there. I'm not sure why you felt the need to make a post like this when not much has been shown about her to be so negative towards her. 

And I think folks were mostly surprised by how Brandon came off on their wedding day. He seemed so likeable in the first episode, but on their wedding day his behavior was a bit odd and offputting. Hopefully he'll relax as they get to know each other."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdlzv5e,t3_em1bxp,1578536467.0,"Jessica and Austin's first interaction together is the exact opposite of Brandon and Taylor's. Lots of easy conversation and laughter between the two. There's hope for them! I was worried about Austin being a big momma's boy, but he has a great personality so far."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdlz5gi,t1_fdlylzu,1578535974.0,He was my least favorite until he did those vows. Go Austin! Jessica had really nice vows too. This match might actually work out.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fdlx01m,t3_em1bxp,1578534517.0,I don't know what to make of Brandon. Super Awkward! Good thing Taylor has a personality and can carry the conversation because he is not handling his business right here! lol
Connecticut,fdfkh8s,t3_ekjiu0,1578363804.0,"I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Then lived in Queens, NY for 10 years and have now been in CT for 2 1/2 years. 

I feel like I'm supposed to hate CT because folks complain so much about CT, but I don't.

I feel like I'm supposed to hate Waterbury, but the truth is...I don't.  

Waterbury has a bit of a southern way about it where folks talk to you and are friendly like I'm used to experiencing when in the South. It was a welcome change from the coldness I would get from NYC folks. I live in a super cute townhome community over on Bunker Hill and it's beautiful in my neighborhood from Spring to Fall. A true hidden gem in Waterbury. 

The problem with CT is that they have no pride in being CT folks and they don't have an identity that unites them together to help create a CT culture. 

The only thing I really dislike about CT is this ridiculous vehicle tax. That nonsense has got to go...

I do wish CT had more diverse food options, but I can travel a short distance for that purpose if needed."
