HistoryMemes,ffp8pf0,t1_ffoh50a,1580088985.0,Versaille wasn't punitive unless the treaty specifically stated that Germany had to print out currency at extreme rates with obvious results. And Germany ended up not even needed to pay off much of it in the end.

todayilearned,ffdsnnt,t1_ffdnx7t,1579827920.0,"To the Japanese both the Communists and Capitalists were just as willing to dismantle the institutions they cared about like the Emperor, especially when you consider the fact that the Commies and Cappies were actively working together at that time with stuff like the Potsdam Conference. 

Also remember by this point the Japanese only really cared about the home islands. If the US, which had a navy larger than the other navies of world combined by quite a factor and was the most experienced nation in amphibious invasions and anti-japanese tactics (such as countering kamikaze attacks), wasn't enough to scare Japan into surrendering I don't see how the Soviets, who have a barely existent navy and know bugger all about amphibious invasions, would scare them."
HistoryMemes,ffbkred,t1_ffaz7oq,1579770043.0,I mean that's sort of what I said in a kind of round-about way but not quite the same.

Sure they got fucked in the ass by them but they did fight multiple of those nations at the same time."
HistoryMemes,ffa410n,t1_ff9hht9,1579727450.0,Basically any nation can fight multiple superpowers at once. The actual impressive part is winning against them.

I mean I guess USA, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union are technically ""a very few"" nations."
HistoryMemes,ffa3sm4,t1_ff9svel,1579727318.0,It's less that the tech was crazy and more than they were so crazy desperate that they were willing to try it. The US was in a position to have easily independently developed a ballistic missile similar to the V2 (no thanks to the fact that the V2 was very much derived from Robert Goddard's work) but they didn't because they weren't in a position to really need such a thing.

WorldOfWarships,ff4fn2y,t1_ff3jkcv,1579562464.0,"I would greatly disagree with that. Even the Baltimore class would be a poor candidate to be Aegis cruisers and they weren't ships built before WW2 which were forced onto tonnages too low for them which causing structural deficiencies like the Takao class were. And I don't really imagine a ship who's hull armour is just a 102mm belt barely sticking above the waterline to be ""capable of surviving a few direct missile hits to the hull""."

ShitWehraboosSay,femgg41,t3_epwoq7,1579254223.0,Man I was *totally* going to support that guy until I realised that he wasn't shitposting.
ShitWehraboosSay,femg8me,t3_epx1wm,1579253905.0,"I don't really buy the argument that they were particularly more scared of the Communists considering that they believed that the Capitalists were equally planning/willing to dismantle basically all that they believed in/were fighting for.

In addition there was no way the Soviets were going to get troops on mainland Japan without heavy assistance from the Western Allies. Contrary to what people believe amphibious landings are ***hard*** and the Soviets have neither the equipment nor expertise to pull it off.

edit: I've heard claims that Soviets joining the war did help cause Japan to surrender as beforehand the Japanese were hopping that they could negotiate a more favourable surrender through a neutral third party that was the Soviets. Of course I have yet to see evidence given for this so probably take it with a pitch of salt unless evidence is found."
WorldOfWarships,fei4oxp,t1_fehxp6z,1579130217.0,That is true that they should adjust things via small corrections however one would expect the corrections to actually affect gameplay.

ShitWehraboosSay,fdtwd27,t3_en3qzp,1578723282.0,Pretty sure the US Army ran into Tigers a couple of times other than the train incident but it is true that such instances were very rare and massive amounts of erroneous reporting of contacts with Tiger tanks were a thing.
HistoryMemes,fdtud39,t1_fdslfrm,1578722345.0,I mean Okinawa is a pretty obvious spot if one is leapfrogging towards Japan.

HistoryMemes,fdpbkvd,t1_fdp7bml,1578624542.0,Yea the British and French shrugged so hard that they were considering bombing the bloody Soviets. Some serious shoulders they have.

todayilearned,fddhwg3,t1_fddcj0p,1578312971.0,"> The Soviet atom bomb was largely due to captured Nazi research

*If that's true the Soviets probably would had never gotten their own nuclear weapons.* 

That's probably an exaggeration but when the US bugged the room of the Nazi scientists to listen to their reactions to Hiroshima getting nuked it was pretty clear that they had a relatively poor understanding of the theory behind nuclear weapons at least compared to what progress the US had made. The high-up Soviet spies within the Manhattan Project were probably much more important.

And while the AK likely had influence from the mp44 the (potentially unintended) implication that the former was just a copy (whether it be the design or the concept) of the latter is very much incorrect. IIRC the two came to be from opposite directions with the AK being based on the idea of the SMG concept scaled up to a ""proper"" rifle and the STG being the full powered rifle concept scaled down enough to be controllable at full-auto (or the other way around)."
