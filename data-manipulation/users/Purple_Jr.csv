depression,ffi10sp,t3_etkvgj,1579961823.0,"I heard people behind my back say how ugly or just give off remarks that allude to it. Everytime I'm paired with someone in any kind of activity, they're always not making any kind of eye contact with me, and their friends laughing at the fact that they're with me. Along with that, the people I've dated have all dumped me most likely due to my looks and personality. Ugly on the outside, and a fucking disgrace on the inside. I'm 17, but... this will most likely carry over into college and just life, that's why I'm completely okay with living alone, dont want anyone to be disgusted or ashamed that they're around me."

I deserve to he shunned from society and my family, along with total solitude. Maybe then I can sort out my suicidal thoughts without attachments."
depression,fdl5ofj,t3_elqwy9,1578517476.0,"Because of the hollow body and soul I have.

A constant feeling of absolute solitude and loneliness.

If I were to hug someone, I couldn't feel their heat.

If I were to kiss someone, I cant feel the passion at all.

Whenever I talk to people, I cant hear and I cant remember what they say sometimes. 


My deteriorating body and mind also pushes me down.

My memory getting hazier and hazier.

My energy becoming lower and lower by the months.

My happiness crumpling up into nothing.

My sadness becoming numb, no longer being able to tear up and cry.

My anger over my depression fizzling out completely.

My calmness in complete overdrive; giving me no reason to be excited or afraid.

My body getting slower as I lose the reason to move, as my existence is nothing more than a pointless, painful and worthless experience.

My mind getting slower as I have no reason to live anymore.

My love for others dramatically increasing, as I see everyone above me physically and mentally deserving tons of love for their accomplishments. And everyone in worse pain than me still being able to push on, DESERVING to live.

I cant see anyone enjoying my company, as I'm the same fucking thing every single day. Constant silence and constant idiocy.

I've accepted this ""depression"" into me, I've accepted it as just who I am and nothing more. Not intrusive thoughts, just me accepting my worthlessness and shittyness.

I'm lower than everyone, lower than human.

That's why I'm depressed, and why I deserve to die."
depression,fd5ev98,t3_ejw74l,1578176923.0,"I've never connected with a post more in my life.. the only difference is that I'm 17 and feel like my life will be over before I turn 18, so hey I mean I dont need to see the embarrassment that is me graduating and immediately failing in life."
depression,fb3kc07,t1_fb3juqv,1576476145.0,"I appreciate the kind words, if I could cry I probably would right now. But i cant shake the feeling off that i dont deserve to be happy, or enjoy things. Same with my own life. I just feel so worthless y'know?

I dont want to make people mad if I fail. I want them to be happy with me. And I want them to be happy. That's why I go to these lengths. But if people think I'm a nuisance, then I dont want them to be sad or annoyed. That's why I want to be alone sometimes. Not all the time, since I just need time away from the world.

But its like, if I were to tell people I personally know about these feelings. I'd be sent to a mental hospital and be given dose after dose of anti-depressants. So I'm afraid of being sad in front of them. I dont want to be forced to be something I'm not through medicine. And at the same time I don't want the people around me to be angry or sad. It's a rigorous balancing act that I feel like is barely about to fall to the ground.

I'm just scared I guess. To reveal who I am."
