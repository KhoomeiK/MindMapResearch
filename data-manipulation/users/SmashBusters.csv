You paraphrased ""No"" since a 4 trillion dollar surplus is laughable and you have no way to defend that.

Now you have no choice but to pick up this claim:

>Trump has barely been in office for 3 years, and he said he would eliminate the debt in 8 years. Do you need to use your fingers to count how many years he still has?

And walk it out of my shop.

>Again, if you're too stupid to understand my answer, then you should consider your time obtaining that PhD a complete waste.

You made a ridiculous claim.  I tore it a new asshole.  Now you're grasping at straws saying ""y-y-y-you STUPID PHD!!!""

My PhD has contributed to humanity's understanding of the universe.  And it's landed me a job that pays more money than I ever cared for and even know what to do with.  That's all beside the much-appreciated attention and respect.
