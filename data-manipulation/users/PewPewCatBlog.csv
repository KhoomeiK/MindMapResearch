We knew we were ready since I would be finishing getting my Bachelor's degree in December, and it would be just a perfect time for us to have a kiddo. We both wanted kids all our lives, even before meeting each other and several of our friends have had issues getting pregnant in the past so we decided to try our luck. Luck has been good to us."

pregnant,ffjd3vf,t3_etshxf,1579995756.0,"I've actually started seeing a Psychotherapist recently due to issues with my immediate family. I'm only close to my brother who lives 3 states away, and am starting up a relationship with my cousin again who is 1.5 hours away. My mother continues to disappoint me and I am fully NC with my father. A recent event that triggered me to getting help was that I accidently told her the sex of my child and asked her to please not tell anyone since she's one who rattles her mouth off. 

She ended up telling my grandparents the sex of my child before I had a chance to in person, since she was mad I had not told her before then. Basically telling my grandparents how horrible of a child I am and that she's just a victim in this circumstance. I just found this out since my grandparents told my aunt the sex and how my mother told them, and she told my cousin that this had happened. Due to this and other things my mother has done in the past as well as my grandparents enabling her, as well as other unfortunate things I've lived though, I've started to see the psychotherapist, just for help dealing with my emotions now and for postpartum. I'm really hopeful that it will help."

raisedbynarcissists,ff9i7p8,t3_esayjb,1579713564.0,"I'm so sorry your NMum did that... I totally get it. I have my own NMom story too. 

When I got married a year and a half ago, I asked my NMom if she could drive me to my venue from the hotel. She cried and complained that there was no room in her car since she had my brother, his wife and her boyfriend to drive. Luckily my cousin called me after my disappointing call with my mom, and I told her my predicament of not having a ride. My cousin offered right then and there to drive me. 

Day of I got ready in the hotel (hair and makeup), and my mom comes in with her boyfriend. I told her that I would be putting my dress on at the venue several times and told her when we were leaving and where to meet us. She then disappears with her boyfriend, and I don't see her until the ceremony. Thankfully, my cousin had my aunt and my grandma with her so they were able to help me put the dress on with my photographer taking pictures. 

Turns out my mom was pre-gaming in her hotel room. Shows up to the venue drunk, thankfully they took an Uber... She didn't even drive my brother and his wife (they live out of state and didn't have a car) and they had to find a ride too. 

A few days later, I hear that my mom is crying and playing the victim that she didn't get to help me put my dress on to my grandparents and aunt who told her that we had all told her several times where it was going to be. I'm still having issues with this. 

Oh! And at the reception she was totally grinding her boyfriend in the dance floor, to the point where my bridesmaids went out on the dance floor to try to draw attention away from the ickyness of it. My side of the family was mortified. Thankfully my husband's side didn't notice."

pregnant,ff3q1c4,t3_erefgg,1579546386.0,"So I don't know if this works for everyone, but I take a prenatal probiotic daily first thing in the morning (pink stork works for me, I purchased from Amazon... I think it helps? I used to drink Kombucha since I'm lactose intolerant to help me consume dairy, but stopped due to alcohol content since I make my own), and eat a bowl of oatmeal with some cinnamon, honey and a banana (as well as my coffee with a small amount of almond milk) and try to keep up with my water intake for the day. I'll eat a can of beans here and there and veggies here and there and I haven't had any constipation issues. Currently I'm 28+5w. 

Just a warning though. I've heard eating a ton of fiber when your body isn't used to it can also back you up too. So I would slowly introduce it if you're not used to fiber. Also dairy can back you up, though I know broccoli can be insufferable without it for some."
AskWomen,fezj53q,t1_fezhbeo,1579457881.0,"Lolz me too! I'm 6.5 months pregnant with my first child, a girl, and with how bad my relationship is with my own mother, I'm looking for guidance. It's also the same for me that those who are close to their moms, my mom didn't do any of these things."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fesejlu,t3_eqharx,1579364382.0,"Isn't it crazy how we are told that just one time having sex and we would be pregnant and that's not actually how it is? After the first two months of my husband and I trying, I got super disappointed. So I just chilled out and knew it could take years. I also used an app called Flow to track my period and my ovulation days, so we just tried during the ovulation days and decided not to stress about it. I got pregnant the next month. If you're lower in weight, I would suggest gaining weight as well. And if you're trying to get pregnant, TAKE THOSE PRENATALS even if you're not pregnant yet. 

If your insurance allows it, maybe find a therapist/ counselor. I have friends who have firm beliefs that everybody should have a therapist to talk to. I'm a hypocrite and saying this and should have been doing it for years, but I finally scheduled my first appointment with a therapist to help me just manage my stress/ anxieties. 

Good luck. You've got this!"
pregnant,feowhhv,t3_eq8vb4,1579306900.0,"Seems like she's almost out of her first trimester, which is when I started to feel better. I had a lot of gas pains and nausea during my first trimester. I would suggest to not read ""what to expect when expecting"" because I've heard it causes a lot of anxiety and shows a lot of negative about pregnancy. I've read Expecting Better by Emily Oster which seemed more positive. At your next OB appointment or midwife appointment, have her write down all of her anxieties and share them with the doc. If she feels like eating something (especially with nausea) get it for her. 2nd trimester, I felt a lot better, gained my energy back and got rid of the nausea. I also just started at the beginning of a podcast called MumTalk by Emma Jaulin, which has been pretty positive and refreshing to listen to even though the first episodes were from 2018. Might possibly help her anxieties as well. I'm just now heading into my 3rd trimester."

pregnant,fedm0vi,t3_eom1ev,1579014829.0,"I think WIC and Medicaid are your two best options right now. And let them know you are pregnant. WIC doesn't have too many resources due to funding cuts from the Trump Administration, but they will give you a WIC card to get certain types of groceries. You might want to go to TRI County Health, for the food stamps program. Mostly, talk to whoever you talk to in Medicaid and ask them what kind of services are available to you during this difficult time. They should hook you up with some resources.

There might be better keynote speakers in the spring though than in the winter. You can attend the big one in the spring too if you want as well if you graduate in the winter.

How many should I theoretically have? Is this a good brand? Should I buy different inserts? Is there anything else that you all have found that I should have as a starting off first time mom?

Also, those I've talked to in my life who have babies (only 2 of my friends/family have had kiddos) both said they tried and gave up cloth diapers. For both, they said that the cloth diapers leaked non stop with the inserts. One also had issues with her kiddo breaking out in a rash. I really want to make the cloth diapers work, not only for the environmental reasons, but for financial and health reasons. I guess, what ways have you all overcome these issues, if you have had them?
