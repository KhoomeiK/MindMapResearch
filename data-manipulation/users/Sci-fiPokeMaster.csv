Their national drink is literally an alcoholic beverage.  The rhetorical mask is that of the refusal to drink but it's pretty wide spread.  It comes from some minor Sunni beliefs that were adopted by the Ottoman ruling class and it's a pretty great history, actually.  A lot is said about their secularism but that ignores the deep history of alcohol in the country.

socialism,ff3cxvc,t3_erf4nl,1579538648.0,"All economic Marxist socialism is derived from that critique.  Everything after it is either built upon it or a critical evaluation of it so roughly everyone who is a socialist does have an element of it in their ideological DNA.  

Strictly speaking he was evaluating the economy in which he existed so you have to take his words with a grain of salt and get critical of how it applies to today.  The major problem is that it butts up poorly for socialists who are more interested in pure social reform.    You have to ask questions about what you think is valuable and who owns that value.  Do you own your labor or does the collective own it?  What's the functional difference between society owning labor collectively versus a large corporation?  Does that give anyone agency or is it a other form of being an actor.  Communists, Socialists, and Anarchists debate these questions and all come to different conclusions about the answer.  

To recap, yes they do but not strictly as a set ideological position but rather some derivative of the original idea.  The exception are the classical Socialists who follow the old French masters out of the French Revolution."

Spain is your best example but even they were not considered a dominate ideological group.  The overwhelming leftist end game was a socialist state with Russian allegiance and support.  

People love to look back at some old glory days when people took up guns and fire bombed stuff but those were actions that lost public support.  Look closer in our current history.  Why not look at the protests in Canada during the America Bush presidency?  Thousands of anarchists took the streets from many countries and formed a consensus body to handle everything from food distribution to medical care on top of where to protest, what to do, and a myriad other details.  They advocated non-violent resistance and communication so that nobody could accuse them of any wrong doing or pain.  The enemy isn't some bureaucrat or the soilder, or even the cop.  They are just as much victims of the system and killing them and bombing the homes they live in isnt and hasn't made the world a better place.

Strictly speaking he was evaluating the economy in which he existed so you have to take his words with a grain of salt and get critical of how it applies to today.  The major problem is that it butts up poorly for socialists who are more interested in pure social reform.    You have to ask questions about what you think is valuable and who owns that value.  Do you own your labor or does the collective own it?  What's the functional difference between society owning labor collectively versus a large corporation?  Does that give anyone agency or is it a other form of being an actor.  Communists, Socialists, and Anarchists debate these questions and all come to different conclusions about the answer.

Not only has the Ukraine never had a truly break out successful Anarchist movement that realistically challenged Ukrainian or Russian authority they never were able to get enough public sympathy because of the killing and terror.  On the whole the track record of the militant anarchist is pretty bad save for some homies in Mexico but even they are far too zealous for their individual situation.  

Spain is your best example but even they were not considered a dominate ideological group.  The overwhelming leftist end game was a socialist state with Russian allegiance and support.  

People love to look back at some old glory days when people took up guns and fire bombed stuff but those were actions that lost public support.  Look closer in our current history.  Why not look at the protests in Canada during the America Bush presidency?  Thousands of anarchists took the streets from many countries and formed a consensus body to handle everything from food distribution to medical care on top of where to protest, what to do, and a myriad other details.  They advocated non-violent resistance and communication so that nobody could accuse them of any wrong doing or pain.  The enemy isn't some bureaucrat or the soilder, or even the cop.  They are just as much victims of the system and killing them and bombing the homes they live in isnt and hasn't made the world a better place.  The enemy is the system and if even one person is a slave then none of us is free and what good does it do for the slaves to kill each other for the good of the system."

Chavistas, Chinese authoritarians, Cuban white washers, and Russian apologists all make their home in the leftists pro-government subs.  They excuse genocide and war as meaningful exchanges as though killing and terror will breed peace.  Like trying to get a lion to mate with a lamb so you can have the best of both species without a care that the lion will obviously eat the lamb, never mind that lambs aren't even sexually mature."
