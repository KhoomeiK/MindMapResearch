The reference datasets that we use to calculate your Ancestry Composition are designed to reflect distinct, genetically similar populations that existed before transcontinental travel and migration was common (\~500 years ago). For example, if recent generations of your family lived in Latin America, you are likely to have some Native American and some Iberian genetic ancestry because most mixing between those two populations happened within the past 500 years.

If migrations from the Arabic world to central and south Asia happened thousands of years ago, can they tell the difference today between what genes are central Asian and what genes are Arabic?
