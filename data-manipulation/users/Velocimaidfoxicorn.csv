actuallesbians,ffh522f,t1_fff1t5v,1579923320.0,It's true. I don't want to create an awkward situation like that. I'd only get it off my chest if I were about to leave the job and I knew there wasn't a danger of that sort of thing.
actuallesbians,ffh4w8m,t1_ffet578,1579923194.0,"It would be really hard to stay away from her, since we work the same shift together every day. It sucks, but the reason I didn't make my move sooner is that I was still in a relationship that was making me unhappy, but I wanted to do the right thing and wait to make a move until after we broke up. And by then, of course..."

bipolar,fe6tcsd,t1_fe6rbhy,1578904515.0,Sure! That would actually be really cool! My reddit username also goes for places where I post art so it's good for giving credit.
bipolar,fe6tahd,t1_fe6s16l,1578904424.0,I appreciate that! I've been having a really rough time for the past couple months and I just needed to get this out of my head so that people around me can get an idea of what I've been going through.
bipolar,fe6l1vi,t3_enzidf,1578894446.0,"You definitely aren't the only one feeling that way. I go through the same thing every time I go depressive. I try my best to push through anyway, but what always helps me is to grab a coffee with a friend or talk with them during a break at work or something, and just that helps me feel a little less lonely and alien."
bipolar,fdmt9gx,t1_fdmmvfk,1578564691.0,I’ll have to give it a shot. Looks like the co-pay is $10 and it couldn’t hurt. I just can’t go on like this and I need to do something before I start feeling like I’m all better again.
bipolar,fdmmnq8,t1_fdmgynq,1578555805.0,My insurance actually covers Teledoc. But I was always worried it would be lower quality help from underqualified people and just for things like if you’re sick and need antibiotics or something. Is it actually possible to get on the phone with one of them and be like “hey I think I’m bipolar as fuck and I really need mood stabilizers ASAP because I think my life is falling apart” and get some solid help?
bipolar,fdmcfz0,t1_fdmbmat,1578545498.0,"I do, but I haven't seen her in almost a year. I've been prescribed antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds by a GP a few times before, but none of them really worked well. I really don't know what I need, but I could really use something to make me feel less like a lunatic and also less depressed and suicidal."
bipolar,fdmanxh,t1_fdmafb0,1578544060.0,"I've thought about checking myself into a facility like that, but I've heard it can be really costly. I'm not sure my insurance would cover such a thing. I'm also afraid of missing work and losing a whole day's pay for that."
bipolar,fdfcpvo,t3_ekz5ti,1578358605.0,"Depends on how I feel before I smoke. Even with the same strain, it can make me feel even more deeply depressed and paranoid that everyone hates me as I start to reflect on my life more intensely through a distorted lens, or I might feel like I've had ten cups of coffee and get overexcited about some grandiose plans I start making, or I'll turn into a paranoid anxious mess and feel like I'm absolutely sure someone is stalking me right outside my window because I heard a noise outside. I always hope for the best side of things, but I still use it to self-medicate too regularly."

BMSR,fb6u2m3,t3_ebmw3r,1576560467.0,"Kind of a roundabout way. Back in high school my dad took me to see Devo play, and the opening act was The Octopus Project. I fell in love with their sound and visuals immediately and the next day I was checking out their entire discography, and I noticed they did a full-album collab a few years before with this other band called Black Moth Super Rainbow. So I check their music out, and well... the rest is history. I was hooked immediately, and they've been my favorite band ever since."
