Quite a bit of muscle doesn't make you an outlier."
fatlogic,fdi215c,t1_fdhp86y,1578434327.0,Why won't you admit that you're morbidly obese? You've had your body fat measured?
EDAnonymous,fdi0t0b,t1_fdhzmf8,1578433708.0,"I do definitely think differently about people I've met in person -- but also, I have no idea what the BMI is of whoever the clearly-anorexic person is I see at my local park and sometimes at the gym I used to go to (you don't have 0 visible fat, a face and decolletage with bones sticking through, and very little muscle tone if you're a ""healthy"" weight), aside from ""severely underweight"". I certainly can't tell a 16 from a 17 in person, and would have no idea about what a 12 even looks like, and I'm not googling to find out."

I'm still torn on whether I say anything to my doc -- who is at that clinic location -- because I'm pretty sure she doesn't want a staff member triggering a patient, and it's pretty clear in my medical history that there is an ED history/ongoing issue."
EDAnonymous,fdhwgtb,t3_elfowg,1578431403.0,"Also keep in mind  that people aren't always honest. It's really easy to say on the Internet that you're whatever BMI, because it's not like anyone is going to be able to check."
