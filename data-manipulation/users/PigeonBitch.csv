Skincare_Addiction,fez6oct,t3_eqvped,1579454352.0,"Drunk elephant’s TLC framboos serum helped with mine, I get the mini size one with marula oil. Since you already have the exfoliant I would consider adding a BHA only exfoliant for the middle of the week. COSRX makes one."
Skincare_Addiction,fez5ysc,t3_eqx5gi,1579454117.0,"I would advise double cleansing, use an oil based cleanser and then a water based cleanser. You can use gentle cleansers for both of these and you don’t have to be rough with your skin."

If you really hate them you may be able to cover them a bit with makeup.
