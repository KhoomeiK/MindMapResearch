I'm sorry. I know it hurts like hell. I know you're wondering about a future alone (though odds are you will find someone else and be happy) but if I went through this twice I wouldn't survive.

CreepyWikipedia,fcmqyif,t3_ehm1fy,1577787859.0,"In April 2019 a report commissioned after Shana Grices' murder concluded that stalking and harassment offences were not being properly investigated by Sussex Police.[10] The report was by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Servicesand it said that a training programme introduced after Shana Grices' murder to help staff understand and identify stalking ""was never fully completed"".[10] Most investigating officers had received no training.[10] Not enough victims were being referred to support services and there was concern over online stalking.[10] Police forces nationally were not using forces under stalking laws to search suspects' homes, making investigations less thorough.[10] Injunctions were not being used, so victims were not being properly protected.

People in Sussex should be horrified and outraged that their police department couldn't be bothered to complete the training laid out for them even after that poor child was murdered because of their negligence. I'm livid and I don't even live in the UK. I'm not sure what sort of pressure the public can place on law enforcement there but taking action to compel the police department to complete training should be encouraged by local citizens.
