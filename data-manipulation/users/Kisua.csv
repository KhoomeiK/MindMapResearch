DnD,ffem4ed,t1_ffcgdap,1579853962.0,"Honestly, I'd be okay with that. I always want to play new characters, and have a bad habit of backseat gaming. People don't seem annoyed when I point out strategy suggestions though--it might be because I say them in funny voices."
DnD,ffem0dw,t1_ffcdig3,1579853808.0,"It might be the anxiety, and introversion. So that most people don't know how many of the people they know actually play DND. Almost like a ""we don't talk about Fight Club."""
bodyweightfitness,ffelsu3,t3_et2vgx,1579853525.0,"Hey so I am noticing a lot of people are talking about losing weight, and I 100% think that should not be pushed on him, because visibly overweight people get that enough from other people, and he will probably do better with non-judgment from you. If you don't make losing weight the goal of this, it's more likely he'll stick with it. Maybe ask him what sorts of movement he enjoys. Like hanging out in the pool (which some gyms have). That can use the whole body, while being gentle. Does he like dancing? You guys could be silly and just try to make up the silliest dance moves you can, if you feel comfortable doing that. They've found in studies that people are healthier long-term when they focus not on losing weight but on being healthy in mind and body, and finding movement they enjoy. So try to make this fun, low pressure, and gentle. Slow, steady, and enjoyable wins the race when it comes to making changes like this."

BDSMAdvice,ff6f8cm,t1_ff5wyvk,1579625901.0,"Hey can you try learning how to orgasm on your own? Can you have an out of dynamic discussion about this with him?
Until this year I could not orgasm with a partner, and I just learned how. It's still a lot more difficult that orgasming on my own, but I figured it out! It was mostly mental for me and involves a lot of fantasizing.
If it's the physical stimulation, there are toys you can use.
For me, not orgasming when I need to that badly would be a hard limit. However, I too have a high sex drive."

Yes, we are on the brink of human extinction. However, we have a *chance* if we act now to survive. Technology is advancing so fast! Can we invent a molecular 3-D printer and use the pollution in the environment to build things? Yes. Are we close yet? No, but we are getting closer every day.

It worked well for me because I would work the other days. However, night classes are not enjoyable for me, and I still don't have an answer for that one. I am a morning person and had a day that long, but earlier in the day. Bring healthy snacks with you, and sleep well. Show up to school on your days off and go to the library to study."

Millennials,fd0wimo,t1_fd0ubva,1578124719.0,"Yeah, honestly I relate to gen z more. I didn't have tv (aside from PBS) or Internet growing up though, and missed out on a lot of pop culture. I remember old computers and political events, but not pop music or cartoons. I don't know if it was because we were poor, or because my parents were early adopters of the hipster movement (an article from 2001ish described an art show they were in as hipster)."

TwoXChromosomes,fcuk6lr,t1_fct5p3a,1577982854.0,"I have been sexually assulted and not turned in the guy because of many reasons, but mainly because I am mostly certain in was a case of miscommunication, and I have him pamphlets/had conversations on consent and was 99% certain he would never do something like that again.

That said, if there is a chance of your boyfriend doing this again I would report it so that the next woman has a record to back her up. It could be the difference between life and death for someone because psychological pain is just as bad if not worse than physical.

I was broken for what felt like a long time. I have been doing the hard work of healing, and I want you to know that it does get better. I can think about what happened without having panic attacks, and have worked on the psychological repercussions I am still dealing with. The best thing to come out of this for me is understanding that people who seem good can still do shitty things, and that I do not have to put up with that just because they are good in other aspects of their life. You don't have to either."

SexPositive,fc963aw,t3_ego4gc,1577547622.0,"Penises aren't often visually beautiful or arousing to me in and of themselves. It's the person I'm with that matters more to me, and if they actually take the time to make me orgasm. Honestly, while penetration can feel nice it isn't my favorite part of sex.

Vaginas come in all different sizes, and actually need to be aroused as well and tent internally to be able to handle penetration. So what size of penis or dildo someone prefers probably depends at least partially on what ""length"" their vagina is internally--although I am sure most vaginas are statistically average size, meaning average penises (around 5ish inches erect) likely feel most comfortable physically.

I've dated people with all different size of penis. It hasn't affected things except with the guy who was largest and could not ""go to town"" without causing pain, so preferred other forms of sex than piv."

I also like to go to movies or shows alone, especially at a fancy theater. I like to go to Sephora and other places that give birthday gifts for members.
