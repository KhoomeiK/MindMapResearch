SuicideWatch,fepxskh,t1_feovdmv,1579334310.0,"Call 911. They won't arrest you, I promise. Just say you're scared for your own well being. They will place you in the hospital and then the psych ward. No charges, no anything. Just safety for yourself"
SuicideWatch,fepxm93,t1_fepxijj,1579334171.0,Being suicidal isn't a crime. You won't get charged. Please tell someone so you can be placed and given necessary medication to help you past this.
SuicideWatch,fepxijj,t3_eq89l3,1579334059.0,"Most likely you'll be sent to the hospital, and from there transported to the psych ward on a 72-hour hold at minimum. It's worth it if you're afraid. They will give you medication so you don't get sick (especially if you're an alcoholic like me, they give meds to help you detox). You won't be in any trouble. Please tell him."
