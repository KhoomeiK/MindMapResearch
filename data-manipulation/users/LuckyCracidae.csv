He went over some work stuff with me and kinda did a little subtle tap with his hand on my arm/elbow region saying “ok?” As if he was confirming I understood the “work stuff” lol. No way I felt unsafe, we were at work and he is extremely professional."
offmychest,fdi43jt,t1_fdhyn6p,1578435378.0,"He replied and asked me how my day was going. I felt hints of him wanting to join into conversations I’ve had with other people before, but he had actually later admitted that he was also shy and introverted. Lastly, after I initiated conversation, he made it a point to have a direct eye contact conversation with me about a work thing that he had never done before under similar circumstances, and slightly touched my arm as he was leaving. Slightly....barely. Haha"

I think knowing that can sometimes be a vulnerability helps me to avoid those kinds of people....but it seems they find me. Thank you for your kind words :)"

It’s weird...my friend who was giving me that confidence, and talking me up like that...that has never been a common occurrence in my life, and it’s amazing what a difference it makes. I cherish our friendship. Thank you for the kind words :)"
