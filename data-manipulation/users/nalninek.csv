Political_Revolution,fdlalok,t3_eltjmo,1578519954.0,This is gross. I’m voting for Bernie because of his views and because he doesn’t play THIS kind of low brow bullshit.
Libertarian,fdl4kg1,t1_fdl3q67,1578516938.0,Would you argue the senate working directly with the white house during an impeachment hearing is “working exactly as intended?”
Libertarian,fdl37x0,t1_fdl2h6b,1578516291.0,"Like, for example the Senate Majority Leader should not be working directly with the Whitehouse to undermine an impeachment hearing. He’s not SUPPOSED to, but apparently there are no safeguards in place to prevent it. That’s a failure of the institution and it undermines the separation of powers and the very concept of checks and balances."
Libertarian,fdl2d3b,t1_fdl1w2h,1578515874.0,"Ya but as I see it, the constitution should provide safeguards against such behavior. Men in power are greedy, if they can undermine the will of the people they will and if they have the ability to do so, thats a failure of the institution."

Libertarian,fclwnxp,t3_ehqwll,1577758282.0,"Ya, and just last year there were multiple mass shootings in Texas and their “gun culture” didn’t help one bit.

It’s almost like claiming “guns good” or “guns bad” greatly simplifies an incredibly nuanced issue and completely misses the point."
ChoosingBeggars,fclvm0e,t3_ehpd5i,1577757550.0,"Just call corporate. They always roll over on the employees and give you whatever you want.
