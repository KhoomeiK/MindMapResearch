facepalm,fgmygaq,t1_fgmttlh,1580934357.0,"It's easier to not understand the world. Its easier to think there are evil people and good people. It makes feeling good about yourself much easier when you think you can't be a bad guy. Racism is absolutely rooted in our psychology, and it is essentially impossible to fully escape. I took a test and discovered i'm mildly racist. I don't think that has to be a terrible thing because of what the world is like right now, but its absolutely something i keep an eye on to make sure i'm not upsetting people or discriminating against peoples characters.


Edit: for example, communities containing predominantly one race tend to differ culturally from the communities around them. These differences aren't directly impacted like skin color or anything like that, but are affected by the history of the people, which can be affected by skin color because of racism a la slavery etc. Cultural differences aren't a bad thing. That there are differences between groups of people, even cultural ones, can be considered a form of racism if the groups of people are divided by race, and the people you are interacting with are not definitively a part of that culture.

If you assume a person is part of a culture because of the color of their skin, that is a form of racism. Even if you aren't definitively asserting anything, and statistics are in your favor, I would consider that a mild form of racism. That doesn't have to be a terrible thing because there ARE cultural differences in the world right now, and a good number of them tend to stick to communities based on the races of the people in those communities.

I do my best to treat people kindly based on the commonalities of our cultures, and that seems to work for me.

When assessing danger, it gets a bit tricky. Where I'm from, and I don't believe my home is unique in this, some minorities are known to tend to be lower on the economic ladder. This is almost entirely not their fault, they have been disadvantaged from the start, and while individuals have shown it not impossible to escape poverty despite some level of discrimination, clearly if the solution were feasible more people would have done it. Understanding the motivations behind robbery, pickpocketing, and muggings doesn't seem terribly complex to me. People need things and become desperate, so they take it. While I haven't researched this in particular, I would be very surprised if there were not a connection between economic success and likelihood go mug someone.

Based on this information, I really don't act differently towards people. In fact, its part of my philosophy that showing fear or prejudice against another person is more likely to upset them, thus encouraging an altercation. I would be lying, however, if I said my guard didn't increase slightly around certain people, and I would be lying if I said that my guard is free from racial influence. I don't think what I do is particularly terrible because I do my best to treat people the best I can, and I don't think there is anything wrong with anyones race. In addition, there is statistics to back up generalizations made about a persons economic status, and that is what I'm concerned with. That it can coincide with race is an unfortunate result of centuries of racism and I genuinely hope that changes.

I'd also like to point out that I do not think poor people are bad in any way. It makes sense to me that people taking from others would be more likely to be people who had less to begin with, but I admit that could be an incorrect assumption. I also think that the vast majority of people, poor or otherwise, would turn to such actions.  Living in the place that I do, I am already called naive and foolish for granting so much good will to the people that I do, but I have yet to see any reason to change my views on the matter. Even if my guard does raise slightly, I still do my best to treat everyone kindly.

The thing is, that my guard raises at all is a form of racism. Every person I know would tell me to be more careful because of the socioeconomic situation surrounding me, but because it is racist to do so, and because I believe that showing fear would just upset people, I have decided not to do that. By that I mean I could probably convince myself that my friends and family are right and that I should be more scared, but I won't. I've thought a lot about this and as long as my life is not in danger, I will treat people with the kindness I think they deserve rather than the fear and anxiety that other people treat them with in order to protect themselves from a small minority of these groups.

Yes, I am mildly racist. I don't think that has to mean I'm a terrible person."

facepalm,fg32j4h,t1_fg30dnk,1580467385.0,"Please excuse my confusion. When you call someone a moron and specifically call out their inability to spell the word consensual, I assumed that that was actually the argument you were trying to make. In your reply to me, you did complain that what he said was irrelevant and not funny, but given my lack of knowledge on what was being referenced, and your failure to properly communicate the real reason you were upset, I paid more attention to your original argument. The reason I tried to make this into a discussion about intelligence is because that is what your original complaint concerned. Sure, you could be using the word moron as a generic derogatory term void of meaning, but I tend to believe people mean the things they say. If you want to complain about the relevance or appropriateness of his comment, by all means go ahead. I will likely disagree on your choice of insult, but for all I know an insult could be justified. I'd like to address your other points, so I'm sorry if it doesn't interest you. You don't have to respond.

Knowing the capital of Iran may be useless to you, but my dad grew up there, and we still have some family there, so it isn't useless to me. I think its interesting how something I see as important isn't important to you... interesting that you not valuing that knowledge doesn't make you any less intelligent. So... why is it a bad analogy?

I would argue that being able to spell consensual and sesquipedalophobia aren't completely different. They are in fact, very similar issues. The difference is magnitude. I used a long word that most people wouldn't know how to spell in order to emphasize a point, but it seems I failed. You have a standard for what people can be reasonably expected to know how to spell. That seems clear to me, and that is totally fine. I would agree that it is much more important people learn to spell consensual than sesquipedalophobia because of the difference in frequencies of their use.

 The part that I disagree with is the degradation of a person for not knowing. Rather than call them a moron for their spelling and disagreeable joke, you could mention that they spelled it wrong, and actually explain to them why you don't like their joke. As it stands, there is next to no chance you have had an impact on them, made them want to change. So if that was your goal, you failed. If your goal was to make yourself feel better, then  well, who am I to judge.

A lot of this is made moot by you clearly caring more about the content of his comment rather than his spelling, but I thought I would address what you said anyway because I enjoy discussions like this. I understand if thats not your thing, but your last comment made me less interested in how you felt about it. Resorting to name calling is more effective at agitating me than I'd care to admit, so I'm doing my best to filter out useless fluff so we can have a civil conversation. I stand by what I said about computers reducing the importance of spelling. I'm not saying its not important, just that its becoming less so, and will likely continue to do so. For the record, I'm 21. I'd be curious to know your own age, if you are willing to give that information. I don't often get to know that kind of thing, you see."
Animemes,fg2yctx,t3_ewiiqi,1580461460.0,Yeah sorry to disappoint but real chimeras are not what you think they are.
facepalm,fg2wpev,t1_fg2vuda,1580459209.0,"Yeah, i didn't get the joke, but calling someone a moron for spelling a word wrong seems a little harsh. Personally, I prefer to measure intelligence more by someone's ability to learn rather than what they already know. While I understand most people would disagree, it really seems unfair to call someone unintelligent because, for example, they were not able to afford a proper education. Even if they had the potential to easily surpass you, they would generally be considered dumb, not because of their own lack of skill but because of their circumstances.

More than that, however, not knowing how to spell a particular word is a stupid reason to call someone a moron. I mean come on. Should I call you a moron if you don't know how to spell sesquipedalophobia, or quetzalcoatlus? Or perhaps I could call you a moron for not knowing how to solve for an indefinite integral, or for not knowing what the capital of Iran is? I can get more specific if I need to.

Point being, intelligence can lie in different areas. I had to use google to correct my spelling of sesquipedalophobia, but know off the top of my head the capital of Iran is Tehran, and can perform integration with ease. Spelling is a single microcosm of knowledge that is becoming decreasingly vital with the growing presence of computers to correct us. Your standard for intelligence is way too specific to be useful."
