aww,ffeisid,t1_ffchq7r,1579849718.0,The worse part about this breed is that the reason its bred is sole because of how cute it is. Its not raised to be a 15 year long companion. Its existence is just for pictures...

AskReddit,ff5cn0c,t3_erqkdu,1579587399.0,"Puberty made me so horny. 5 years ago, was on a bus at the back seat with my friend. Bus was relatively empty and everyone in it sat at the front. Me and my friend decided to share sexual fantasies that included our female classmates. Bus stops, I got out of my seat, as I walked down the steps. I found out... we weren’t alone at the backseat! Two seats in front of us was a girl whom I talked about in my sexual fantasy. That shit still haunts me till this day"

Dogtraining,fdpqb00,t3_emk0rt,1578636470.0,"I dont have experience but, I have an idea. If you're willing, why not get another dog? It might cost more money but u'll get 2x more love and your dog wouldn't be alone anymore when you leave the house.

I have a toy poodle that is always sad when me n my family leaves the house. She would become naughty and urinate on the stairs. She only does this when we leave the house for a long time(8-10hrs?) as she is very obedient when we are home. Ever since my family adopted a dog from my mom's friend as they were migrating. My poodle stopped peeing on the stairs when we go out. Perhaps a playmate is the solution?"
