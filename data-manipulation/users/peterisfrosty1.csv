Scams,ffrs2gd,t1_ffrrxvd,1580164563.0,"Yeah I see that, I just meant is it a bad sign for these to pop up in general? As in, is it an unavoidable side effect of visiting dodgy sites or is my device in trouble? That was more my question."
Scams,ffr6kd9,t3_eupi7f,1580151548.0,Is it really bad to get these? Whenever I do I always close out of the site right away but it seems to come in waves where it’ll happen a few times a month and then not at all.
ftm,ffpv8cs,t3_eub2rn,1580106996.0,"My state has this too (WI). Other Redditors have given you info as to why (debt and all that) so I won’t reiterate that but! You can file for what’s called a confidential name change, go to an extra hearing, and worst thing they can do is tell you no and you’ll have to publish it. You can say you’re scared of transphobia at work, school, family, etc. to get it granted (if those are concerns for you). 

Also apply for a filing fee waiver. It’s worth it. My boyfriend saved $300 with it."

premed,ffotmmb,t1_ffosygu,1580081643.0,"I am not a woman, but sometimes perceived to be because I’m trans. (On hormones, just kinda fem in build/profile) I definitely know women, especially non white ones have it soooo much worse in this regard. I hear so many stories of people assuming that black female doctors are part of the kitchen staff or a nurse. Yikes. 

Speaking of PAs/NPs, I never knew there was such strong discourse about them vs. doctors. Even patients have such strong feelings about each group either way, like you said."
religiousfruitcake,ffoomc6,t1_ffoerwj,1580079989.0,I’m assuming it’s female genital mutilation but the commenters didn’t use in a grammatically correct way?
college,ffoo78w,t3_euduof,1580079833.0,Yo what the hell... I hate that. I had to use WileyPlus last semester and thankfully my teacher would change our grade if stuff like this happened.
premed,ffonqrt,t1_ffonkwf,1580079659.0,"Exactly, exactly."
premed,ffolzqj,t1_ffol85g,1580078996.0,"Yeah, it would make more sense if I already WAS a CNA though, you know? I wouldn’t get offended then because it makes sense and friends I’ve had who are becoming RNs were CNAs first! 

Well, I’ve visited several medical schools (two in state) who say that clinical hours are one of the top things they look at. Any other clinically based job is too expensive & long to be certified or pays like shit (I’m a totally independent student so I unfortunately can’t take $9 an hour)."
premed,ffdw3k2,t3_esz5a5,1579830376.0,"Yeah, to be honest I have to keep other pre meds at arms length because of this. I am already hard on myself with grades so I can’t handle anyone trying to talk down to me or act better than me. I’m the first person in my entire family to ever go to college, I ran away from home at 18 and have been independent financially, physically, and emotionally since. I don’t need to focus on the privileges most other pre meds (seem to) get. The negativity will never get me anywhere. 

During my last shadowing opportunity, I had an MS1 get super bitter that I got to watch in the OR with her, even asking in a condescending manner “have you even ever seen anything like this?” Funny thing was, I’d had the procedure myself and knew exactly what it was gonna be like, and she asked several questions about transgender patients that I knew because I am (I of course did not answer, not my place, but still.) Was she not once a pre-med shadowing? She just acted so elite and mad that I got attention from the doctors too."
relationship_advice,ffcir03,t3_esufvn,1579800336.0,"Aside from the issue you’re facing, you don’t really “pass” the MCAT so I think your wording is funny. Also, doesn’t scheduling it cost like $300? He’s spent $1800 to not take it?"
raisedbyborderlines,ff7cs3j,t3_erzdps,1579646549.0,Why does he look that way?? Super cute but I’m wondering if it’s a breed or he has a problem
college,ff7cjbz,t3_eryxub,1579646380.0,"I love learning and school but I hate the people at my school. It’s getting kinda bad, I really keep everyone away from me because 99% of people I’m around seem so insufferable. :/"
FTMMen,ff7c0wg,t1_ff7bwc7,1579646007.0,"Did you read my description? It’s a percentage discount, and then each hospital has policies regarding payment plans for the remaining balance (if there is one, lots of people can get it reduced to $0 like I did). Some allow them, some don’t, some do under the financial assistance. Everywhere is different."
FTMMen,ff5sc24,t1_ff5jglp,1579608379.0,Not even necessarily what I would consider low income. It’s both uninsured and for my hospital anyone who made under $60K.
starbucks,ff231p5,t3_er46kz,1579492447.0,"Tbh if I were you I wouldn’t work off the clock. I don’t even think Starbucks wants you to since it’s a huge liability for them if something happens and you’re not clocked in. 

I had it happen where a dude asked a question about what kinds of payment we took even though I was there just as a customer. I told him politely he could talk to any of the baristas behind bar, but he insisted on coming closer into my personal space and only asking me. And see, I’m an asshole off the clock. I’m also stubborn. So I refused to answer, again saying he could ask someone in a green apron. He loudly exclaimed “Well someone’s not getting employee of the month!!!!” 

I couldn’t care less."
