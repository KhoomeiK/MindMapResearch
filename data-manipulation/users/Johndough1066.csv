Exposure doesn't cause addiction. 

The overwhelming majority of people who take Vicodin after oral surgery never become addicted, never have a problem.

And those who do -- it's way more complicated than just the Vicodin. 

But chronic pain patients can no longer get opiate medication because of this myth.

I didn't say he wasn't the best. I said vets and dog training professionals think he is abusive to dogs.

Not according to people who should know.

So you say.

>Other then that hes well trained, sits and stays on command, comes on command even when in trouble and is a great dog. Making him wait for his food is not cruel or animal abuse. Not even close

Straw man. Cesar Milan uses abusive and outdated techniques that hurt dogs.

>I asked about the cat because I havent had a feral

If she's letting you touch her and play with her, she's not feral.

> so I reached out as I said I'm playing with her now. When she cries for attention I stop and she stop...

Some people are too emotionally fucked up to learn. 

>then she gets more attention. I shouldnt treat a cat like a dog, you're right, which is why I'm reaching out on here to ask for advice

>""Wait for your dog to sit calmly, or until she has all four feet on the floor at least, then reward her with a quiet, calm pat on the head. Jumping is a dog's way of trying to gain dominance over you...."" according to expert behaviorist Cesar Milan.

Cesar Milan?? Are you kidding? He's the last person you should be quoting when it comes to dog training and behavioral theory. 

""Professional dog trainers find Millan's methods outdated, flawed and ""unscientific and inhumane.""  Millan's detractors say that what Millan calls ""calm submission"" is actually a state of helplessness that is the result of averse dog-training techniques. A study in Applied Animal Behaviour Science said Millan has been influential in popularizing punitive techniques, but that bad behavior from dogs was caused by fear and anxiety, not a lack of the owner's alpha status.""

Cesar Milan is a freaking monster and you quote him? You inflict his training techniques on your dog?? And you want to inflict them on a freaking cat?

What is wrong with you?

Says who? I mean, other than that abuser Cesar Milan?

>Doesn't mean you live them any less. For example my dog has to SIT and wait to eat after I put the food down. I usually make him wait 30 seconds - 5 minutes

Why? What does that achieve -- other than making you feel like you have power -- over a dog!

>Same with attention. He cant bark or whine and i come running that trains him to do that whenever he wants something which leads to behavior issues.

Oh, man. I am quite sure your dog has a ton of behavior issues and that's all thanks to you and your buddy Cesar.

Why did you ask if you thought you already knew the answer?

Btw, some cats just meow a lot. It's what they do. 

>Just like dogs you don't greet then when you get home until they stop jumping all over you going crazy

Cats aren't dogs. If this cat, who has been deprived of love and affection for so long, is asking you for love and affection -- give love and affection. 

It's pretty simple. 

Oh -- and as for dogs jumping all over you -- is anyone else that happy to see you come home? If not, you might want to rethink denying genuine joy.

I mean, how would you feel if you were thrilled to see someone and they turned away?"

If she wants attention, give it to her. Jesus, she's probably been alone and without any affection for a long time. Make her feel sure. Give her all the love she needs."

Yes. A parent is supposed to protect their child from toxic people.  YTA for having your daughter live with this abusive woman.  You should have your own place with your daughter rather than expose her to this abusive woman whose behavior will scar her for life."

>I want to stop feeling so upset by her constant looking down her nose at me, 

I don't blame you. But that's how she is. If you want to stop feeling so upset by her constant criticism, you will most likely have to cut her out of your life. 

You can give her a chance if you want. You can make a clear boundary and say, ""I don't want you to criticize me. If I feel you have criticized me, I will leave."" And then you do exactly that. 

If it were me, I'd just tell her, ""I don't like the way you criticize me all the time. So I will not be spending time with you in the future.""

Then I'd just leave.

>but I feel I may have an interiority complex to her and I have spent so long just longing that she tells me she's proud of me as a sister, or just says something good about me.

She's not going to. Why? Because of HER. She isn't that kind of person. It has nothing to do with you.  She's broken. 

> Probably due to her heavy criticism over the years. I'm half tempted to cut her out.

Half tempted? How about all tempted? Do it! Make yourself happy. Cut her out of your life.

> I could cure cancer and she'd tell me I took too long to do it.

Exactly! You know it isn't you. It's her.

 >I want our relationship to be less toxic so I just want to hear people's advice.

You can't change her. Nothing you can do will change her. If you want less toxicity in your life, remove her. Go no contact.
