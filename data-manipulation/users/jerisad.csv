Rit can't be restocked in the winter in Canada because they ship on trains and it freezes, so a lot of stores start to run out this time of year. If you're desperate you might have to order online and have it shipped by plane."
dyeing,ffc5eia,t1_ffbjcv4,1579791932.0,"I was actually backwards on that- textile medium is for painting on clothes with a brush with regular acrylics, it makes it bond better to fabric and paint more smoothly (G&S brand is a good one). 

For airbrushing anything that's not specifically an airbrush paint you need airbrush medium made by Golden, it makes it so you can spray acrylics and stuff. I think with airbrush medium you could spray colorless Wildfire blacklight paint."

dyeing,ffa0goc,t3_esdlr4,1579725387.0,"No dyes are black light reactive, but I've painted costumes to react with great results with Wildfire paint. You can manually paint it on with a brush, and I imagine it would airbrush if you mixed it with textile medium. 

You could try watering it down heavily and dunking a tie dyed shirt while still tied up, it should take on the outer parts only just like the dye. If you try this please post it!"

Anyway OP- I'm not sure its possible to  ombre dye 100% polyester because of the amount of time and heat it takes for the color to grab. If it's poly I'd recommend painting it."

If it makes you feel better, artists who draw that way don't generally inhabit the realm of ""fine art"". They're generally considered illustrators which are usually seen as commercial artists, even if they sometimes do unpaid work for their own collection. Basically, it's hot women being used to sell things, and it's nothing new. It's popular on Reddit because Reddit is mostly young men (the group most targeted by advertising), not art connoisseurs. 

Fine art is pretty over hot girl art too."
dyeing,fezhvqr,t3_eqwiju,1579457515.0,"That stuff is very synthetic, usually polyester, meaning the color is added when the fiber it's made, it can't really be stripped.

Sorry it didn't get many upvotes. I think because this is a small sub, if two things get posted in the same day often the first one gets all the exposure and the second one won't make people's front pages.

If you put blue dye on red it will be purple. 

The only way to dye only half of it cleanly would be to take out the lining and the ribbing, cut the center back seam, and dye half of it. At that point you might as well buy blue fabric.

It says spouse but your parents won't actually be recorded as spouses unless you add a marriage event. It's a super heteronormative, nuclear family oriented site unfortunately, but it's free and it's run by a church so it's kind of to be expected.

It's likely that your family's name was changed from something else at some point. In the past people were largely illiterate so permanent records of their names and their spellings were left to clergy, census takers, etc. Sometimes there will be records under multiple names throughout a person's life. 

Often the change isn't large, just a letter or two usually. For example in my family  ""Hilton"" became ""Yelton"" and ""Martin"" became ""Martinez""."
