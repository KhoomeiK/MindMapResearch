sleep,fet2anu,t1_fes9jco,1579371170.0,Yeah I knew that it affects sleep quality but poor sleep is better than no sleep or tossing and turning until 5 am.  I know that the root cause of it is most likely anxiety as I have struggled with it my entire life.  My therapist wants me to meet with a doctor to start me on an SSRI so that could be the solution.  And I only take 25 mg Benadryl which is a very low dose.  I also am pretty sure melatonin and magnesium do not interfere with sleep quality
sleep,fes8sgv,t1_fes10r9,1579362618.0,"Well the only reason I used to get 10 every night is because I was smoked weed every night to help me sleep.  Now I'm quitting for mental health reasons.  When I'm not smoking weed I have insomnia.  I take magnesium, melatonin, and Benadryl every night just to get to sleep at all"
sleep,ferznip,t1_ferz0hh,1579359943.0,Yeah I was worried that that was the case because it's very hard for me to get 8 or 8.5 most of the time.  I definitely notice a difference when I sleep 7 or even 7.5 though
socialanxiety,feo7080,t3_eq5wit,1579295920.0,"I had a channel back in high school of me and some friends just being complete idiots.  Every time I watched the videos back at the time it made me hate myself because I thought I looked so awkward and just like a pathetic human.  I was worried about the same shit you worry about.  My voice, appearance, etc.  Some of them even got up to 50,000 views and it always haunted me because I just assumed everyone in the comments was making fun of me and noticing how awkward I was.  Watching the videos back now I don't see myself the same way I did.  The things I thought were ""awkward"" about myself were really just part of who I am and it just works.  And almost none of the comments were directed negatively at me.  And I didn't even get to choose which parts of the video were uploaded because I didn't edit them so I was completely vulnerable.  In other words, just do it and don't try so hard to be a certain way.  Be as vulnerable as you want.  Hell, purposely show the parts of yourself that you think is so weird"
socialanxiety,feo531c,t3_eq1sv5,1579295235.0,Holy shit so true
leaves,fekg8y4,t1_fekg307,1579199404.0,Do you get heart palpitations too?  I take a cocktail of sleep aids and still have palpitations
leaves,fekdhen,t1_fekbscr,1579197755.0,Well I'll most likely be starting an ssri soon so hopefully that helps
insomnia,feja974,t1_feja6gd,1579163837.0,It's definitely not but I've been dealing with anxiety so I assumed it's from that.  I also took fish oil at around 4 pm so maybe thats part of it?
Dermatology,feflxcs,t1_fe2lk96,1579059149.0,"I appreciate the advice.  I was unfortunately too afraid to see a doctor like you said, but instead I started dousing the thing with hydrogen peroxide everyday to prevent infection and it came clean off today.  No wound or anything.  I'm very relieved.  Next time I will probably just see a doctor instead though because this was painful and uncomfortable"
AskReddit,fednc7t,t1_fedn13w,1579015700.0,Not if your heart is literally racing for no reason
socialanxiety,fe673bh,t1_fe5tyyo,1578883265.0,Exactly.  Sometimes I'll leave a social situation feeling like I was a whole different person the whole time and I have to re-find myself.  Especially at work.  I am 100% not myself in any work setting for some reason.
socialanxiety,fe5owqe,t3_enoacq,1578872420.0,Fuuuuuuck that
Dermatology,fe2jhxv,t1_fdwlh4p,1578839115.0,Out of curiosity what does an infected skin tag look like?  I have no way of taking the floss off because it's so tight but I woke up this morning and half of it has turned purple
anhedonia,fdss8k7,t1_fdspw4t,1578707274.0,I'm no professional but I think we're very similar and I've found that the worst thing you can do is isolate yourself.  Try to connect with people as often as possible.  This is extra hard for me because I have social anxiety.  But whenever I can force myself to become more social I am able to get out of my head just for a little bit.  And I mean consecutive days of being social.  Just realize that no amount of thinking can fix your scenario right now.  If there is something going on mentally that will sort itself out.  Thinking just makes it worse
anhedonia,fdsnili,t1_fdsff2l,1578705525.0,"I don't think it's a coincidence that you have that overthinking tendency and you also have this numbing going on.  Remember that anxiety alone can manifest almost anything.  It's bizarre.  That's not to say that you never had it in the first place, but it's possible you're so fixated on it that you're manifesting it.  Of course I don't know your situation very well but that's my 2 cents"
anhedonia,fds8sio,t1_fdnk5re,1578696954.0,It honestly sounds like you're depressed and you don't realize it.  It's very common to be depressed for so long that it feels like the new normal.  Also anxiety can manifest symptoms that aren't actually there.  You should just talk to a psychiatrist about it honestly.  I was in that loop of sitting there analyzing how every little thing made me feel and it takes a toll on you.  It's just not normal.  I would try meds too.
zoloft,fds55yq,t1_fds4ome,1578694592.0,Everything worked fine I just lost interest in girls completely so really I think it was just part of the anhedonia.  I could still get off whenever I wanted I just didn't feel much joy from it.  And ever since the anxiety and depression came back I stopped smoking weed.  I think I only started because I was happy and it had been a long time since I felt any anxiety or depression.  Maybe I'll go back on Zoloft but keep it to a low dose
socialanxiety,fds22xt,t3_emxqn7,1578693153.0,"We all do man.  I don't understand why it's so socially acceptable to ask this.  Its no different from saying ""why are you so fat?"" or ""why are you short?"" Like yes we can all see that I'm not good at socializing so stfu"
socialanxiety,fds16lg,t3_emvt6o,1578692717.0,Sounds like social anxiety.  Nothing too serious.  I can relate heavily.  Zoloft basically cured me if you're looking for a medication although I eventually got side effects.  I'd just talk to a psychiatrist about it if I were you.  Therapy helps a lot too.  It's nice to be able to express your worries to someone and get confirmation that there isn't any truth to them.  The biggest cure really is just acceptance.  The times when I've been anxiety-free are also the times when I've accepted and loved myself and my weirdness.  Easier said than done though
socialanxiety,fdrz3jh,t3_emwtc1,1578691871.0,Find a hobby.  I make up for my boring shitty personality by being good at a lot of things and being a hard worker.  People look up to that and look past the other stuff
socialanxiety,fdry39i,t1_fdqdx1q,1578691382.0,I always thought I was the only one in the world who did this.  It got a lot better when I was on Zoloft but then I came off of it because of side effects.  Also when I get really drunk Im able to be myself
socialanxiety,fdpm4pt,t3_emgf84,1578632508.0,"Damn man that's quite possibly the most relatable thing I've ever read.  Been doing this since probably middle school.  I kind of feel like I noticed early on in life that my personality doesn't match that of others, so I had to build up a character that I thought people would like.  In my head I'm basically pretending I'm a different person, but to others I always wonder how I come off.  I used to record secretly record interactions with people just to see if I looked awkward in any way"
lotrmemes,fdpla4n,t1_fdkg1sn,1578631776.0,"Right?  I always leave every social interaction thinking ""welp, they think I fucking hate them."" Then I wonder why they even invite me back lol"
socialanxiety,fdk9e00,t3_elt7qg,1578499046.0,"I was the same way in high school.  I went to a huge school and they were too lazy to send letters so they just had a system that automatically called and emailed my mom when I skipped.  I went online and blocked the schools number on my mom's phone, and I hacked into my mom's email so I could delete every email about me skipping.  I strategically skipped the exact number of days I could miss without failing and barely survived.  I understand the worry though.  I knew if I told my mom how miserable school was for me she would probably make me transfer schools and she'd worry about me a lot.  Just get through it.  Things get so much better after it's done.  Focus on what makes you happy outside of school and do whatever you need to do to just get through it"
socialanxiety,fdh1tr0,t1_fdgfdxj,1578413544.0,"Same.  It was like ""I can't wait until I'm an adult so I don't have social anxiety anymore.""  Now instead it's ""I wish I was a kid so I could get away with my social anxiety again"""
socialanxiety,fdc17dr,t3_ekej18,1578265114.0,"Damn we finally have a response to ""why don't you ever talk?"". ""because I'm an NPC"""
leaves,fcy1zpx,t1_fcwn0f9,1578073674.0,About 3 and a half weeks before.  I guess what I'm really asking is will I have to go through some withdrawals again from just one time
leaves,fcwk3l1,t3_ejah1f,1578027796.0,"I take melatonin, Benadryl, and magnesium to sleep"
socialanxiety,fcwidve,t1_fcwhgvb,1578026432.0,"I know what myself is, but I'm rarely able to show that to others.  Sometimes if I spend too much time around other people it takes me a few days to find myself again because I've been stuck in that stupid act of just trying to appease them for so long"
socialanxiety,fcwi5o8,t1_fcwcyy3,1578026257.0,"How?  Each social interaction I have makes me feel worse about myself.  I can tell myself to just be myself when I hang out with someone, but as soon as I'm around them my mind goes blank and I'm forced to just resort to copying their persona."
socialanxiety,fcwhvnq,t3_ej6zp2,1578026043.0,"Sounds like me in a nutshell lol.  I don't really get the nervousness and panic attacks that are sometimes associated with social anxiety, but I do struggle with everything you just described.  I'm not sure how to fix it unfortunately.  Planning on bringing this sort of thing up to my therapist next time I see him"
socialanxiety,fcwai8o,t3_ej92zu,1578020909.0,This is all very relatable.  Best thing you can is learn to laugh at yourself.  You can't change who you are.  Also try not to dwell on bad social experiences.  When you're feeling down distract yourself with something.  For me that's working out or running.
socialanxiety,fcw6zdt,t1_fcvjvmr,1578018582.0,Exactly.  Because you know those confident people don't understand and they're probably judging you silently
socialanxiety,fcufaoq,t3_ehd5yz,1577979566.0,The best thing you can do is just try to be present in the situation and listen to what others are saying.  You have to get to a point where your words don't have to pass through a filter.  I'm really only able to do it around people I've known for years.  Also I think practice is important too
socialanxiety,fct5uq8,t1_fct3hjs,1577933659.0,"That's okay.  I was the same way most of my life until I started college.  I hid in the bathroom during lunch at school and said literally nothing to anyone.  I still go through phases where I'm convinced everyone thinks I'm a depressed loser and  I'll never be able to connect with anyone.  Focus on your own happiness.  Go for runs every day or go to the gym.  You might hate it at first but over time it'll help your self esteem tremendously.  And the best way to find friends is through hobbies.  Find a hobby you enjoy and find people who also enjoy it.  For me it was guitar.  I still rarely am able to truly be comfortable around people, but I've grown to accept that because it's part of who I am"
socialanxiety,fct2ecs,t3_eirg4c,1577931098.0,"I worry about that too.  I think ""normal"" people just don't care if people think they're weird"
socialanxiety,fct1qd5,t1_fct0xml,1577930610.0,Just take baby steps.  A lot of people start by just saying hello to strangers.  What helped me was when I started playing guitar and then found bands to play with back in high school.  I'd have panic attacks on the way to practice literally every time and one time I even puked all over my car outside a drummers house from nervousness.  I just kept forcing myself to do it though and it helped
socialanxiety,fct0yg5,t1_fcq9aej,1577930045.0,I always thought it was from social media and too much technology
socialanxiety,fcswp8q,t1_fcsvza5,1577927027.0,"You mean socializing with Co workers?  Because I can definitely relate.  I'm usually the quiet one in the corner at work and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  As for customers, that becomes easier with time as you can simply practice what to say and then say the same thing every time.  I'd try something like Postmates or ubereats to start out.  There's no interview and you can just work whenever you want.  Assuming you have a car.  If its really that debilitating don't be afraid of trying an antidepressant either"
socialanxiety,fcsw1z4,t3_eimq9g,1577926561.0,I had a similar experience last night.  Was way too anxious to have fun and people noticed.  There's no reason to feel guilty.  Someone who doesn't have anxiety cannot understand what it's like for us.  Also parties are simply not for everyone and there's nothing wrong with that
socialanxiety,fcsvimq,t3_einaop,1577926172.0,What is it that you're anxious about exactly when it comes to getting a job?
socialanxiety,fcssjh6,t1_fcss4tt,1577924020.0,Yup.  I started noticing this around high school.  It's like the personality I have around one friend can only be activated when that friend is around.  Then you get a total mindfuck when you're around 2 different friends that don't know each other and you don't know how to act whatsoever.  It's crazy how dumb the stuff we worry about really is isn't it?
socialanxiety,fcsr7zi,t1_fcspxmb,1577923063.0,Yeah that makes sense.  I ask because I was hanging out with some old high school friends the other day and I was having a great time and being the life of the party almost.  Just yesterday I was with some different friends and they said I was so quiet that I seemed sad and they were concerned about me.  It's quite frustrating honestly
socialanxiety,fcspqf8,t1_fcsplqr,1577921996.0,So do you think certain people make you feel more comfortable and certain people make you more anxious?  I feel like I'm always more comfortable around people who also have social anxiety
socialanxiety,fcqry72,t3_eicf5y,1577891275.0,I spent it embarrassing myself being socially awkward around people.  Maybe if I was alone I could've actually enjoyed new years
leaves,fcav0zo,t3_egwoht,1577577164.0,"Literally all my stoner friends say this.  They're a horrible person when they're sober and weed makes them normal.  It's just not the case.  You first start smoking weed because it enhances everything.  It makes every experience better and more fun.  After a while of smoking it every day, you're brain no longer needs the chemicals to naturally make an experience fun, so it shuts them off.  That in turn makes you a piece of shit when you initially quit.  Just give it like a few weeks or a month and you'll feel the way you feel when you're high all the time"
leaves,fcak8ra,t1_fcaiffq,1577570827.0,And then you get to go through even worse withdrawals when you come off the ssris.  So helpful
Meditation,fbb32xf,t1_fbb1vi3,1576692272.0,"Thanks for the advice.  I'm a very obsessive person, and it's hard to stop obsessing over stuff like this.  Will it become easier as I continue to meditate?"
