EDAnonymous,ffhjm3p,t1_ffhjb6q,1579938248.0,Honestly a good way to put it. Self destruction is our symptom. Self hatred our sickness.
EDAnonymous,ffhfmne,t1_ffh52c2,1579933218.0,Wait... People search for triggers? Fuck. I swear I think I'm fake as fuck for looking at anything else related to it unless it's my idea personally without being influenced. Then when I get a moment away from those thoughts I start mentally slapping myself for being a fake or a useless needy asshole who just refuses to eat. So I keep leaning towards that im faking this and that eventually I'll start eating normally again
EDAnonymous,ffhf4wv,t1_fdgqexz,1579932641.0,"Seriously? I thought I might have an issue but I keep end up eating something even though I make it through the day with restrictions. Then I eat something late night, then feel real gross about it. But I can't stopppp eating it anyways. So I thought I was just being an asshole to myself and faking it"

depression,fctmtj1,t3_eitwlf,1577949353.0,"I've had moments where cutting deeply feels right and better. A warm rush of better feelimgs or sometimes even just finally getting emotions back for a bit. Other times it feels like my reality shifted back to a normal version. Like it makes thing click or become clearer. 

And then there's been times where I know how I feel with cutting. But when I attempt to. It doesn't feel right. It's not the same. So I stop grateful that I'm not insane and I can keep holding out. 

Maybe one day it'll always feel wrong. But I can only hope that I have it under control again."
