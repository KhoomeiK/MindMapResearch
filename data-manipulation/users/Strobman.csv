neoliberal,fgq2iry,t1_fgpynoq,1581016643.0,"Here's an example.  Candidate A is an entrenched candidate with a built in following, near 100% name recognition, and a good fundraising campaign.  Candidate B is an up and comer with good policies that a majority would vote for, but has very low recognition.  If all the votes are held the same day then the established and moneyed candidate has a huge advantage.  Maybe people want to vote for candidate B but don't think he could actually win so they throw their vote behind the known candidate to not split votes, or maybe they don't even know who candidate B is.


However under the current system candidate B can use his/her limited resources to push their ideas to some early states in the hopes of racking up some wins or close 2nds and building his/her Q rating along with voters now thinking he/she now has a shot and throwing their support to said candidate.

moderatepolitics,fgh3na0,t1_fggttrj,1580775920.0,">Again, a bad look but vs Trump this is peanuts.

Just my opinion but this is a serious problem.  Trump is corrupt, has been impeached, lies, and constantly attacks anyone who crosses his path, yet none of it has touched him.  So why do you think there's a difference now?  Trump has shown he can fight in the mud (and likely enjoys it) so I don't think he'd have any problem dragging Sanders down with himself.  And in all actuality (based on his short political career) will be the one who rises out of a dirty, mudslinging fight."
moderatepolitics,fgh20ms,t1_fggvf9y,1580774810.0,">I find it silly for anyone who cheered and defended Trump would be upset by the same behavior coming from the other side.

Who cares about those people, they're going to be upset at anything the Democrats do.  We should be more worried about the centrist swing votes who don't want to vote for Trump.  And those are the people that will be pushed away from the party if they see the same shit happening in both parties."

I highly disagree with this.  He hasn't done anything that's affected his base, and if Sanders is nominated Trump will bring up any and all contradictory claims/positions Sanders has had in his political past without any fear of his attacks bouncing back to himself."
