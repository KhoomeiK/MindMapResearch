Overpopulation is definitely a problem for the human race.  The world can't sustain it.  It can handle population decline and aging (i.e. lost productivity).  Elon is thinking from an economic perspective which is barely part of the story.

worldnews,fegs6qt,t1_feg6r6i,1579101300.0,"The MAX externally was essentially the same as the NG.  The larger engines means smaller surface area under the wings which means the stall characteristics shift.  You can't increase the size of the wings because that would result in every airport that uses 737s to overhaul their infrastructure to accommodate.  That would cost trillions of dollars.  So the only option was to reduce the chance of an unintended stall by limiting the angle of attack.  Hence the MCAS software.

As far as the other aspects of the design, there only improvements and better testing methods.  The actual structure was vastly improved.  The software had a bug that went undetected through flight tests and was not frequent enough in flights to give engineers a consistent pattern to troubleshoot.  At the time of the first crash, there were about 50 to 100 MAX aircraft flying daily.  Hundreds of thousands of flight hours accumulated without issues that provided enough feedback.

I know people want there to be some grand conspiracy but the truth is much more mundane.  Engineers and management missed it.  It's rare but it happens because we're still human."
