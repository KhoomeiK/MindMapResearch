selfimprovement,ffu3r20,t3_ev1ver,1580233849.0,"It’s true this method is effective! I’d add here, don’t just use it as a rant/ vent tool but also as an inspirational tool. Record yourself when you get phases of motivation, or when you’re feeling good, and play back to yourself when you feel low. 

I talked to myself into the recorder when I was depressed for one year and it really helped to get stuff out of my system !  But I feel I plateaued and it wasn’t helping anymore, rather it was becoming an addiction. I stopped for a while. Now I use it to motivate myself. Or to record phases of happiness when my thoughts are too rapid to write."

Mindfulness,ffhg9qr,t1_ffh4ycl,1579933963.0,"Right! And to decide which one to feed, you have to know and recognise the two wolves within yourself. But earlier I WAS the bad wolf. I couldn’t even recognise the good wolf because I wasn’t the observer. Now it’s so easy for me to feed the good wolf. I am more balanced and patient. I wait and think before speaking and acting. Honestly it’s just the most amazing feeling."
PandR,ffgom62,t1_fffzy0p,1579911145.0,LITERALLY!
Mindfulness,fffbclw,t3_et8kgh,1579880209.0,"I’m in the exact situation. What I do is, i tell myself that thinking about the past, and letting it overpower me to such an extent that it affects my mood, my relationships and my work negatively, is in itself a bad decision, and if I don’t stop now, I’m gonna be thinking 2 years from now “why did I dwell so much on the past ? Why did I let the past affect me?” Then It’s easier to just let it be. 

Yes it hurts. And life could have been significantly different, maybe even better. But if I let 2018 affect my 2020, then my 2022 is gonna be the same, and I’m gonna be asking myself the same question 4,8,10 years later. So, Whatever May have happened, was it worth 10 years?? The answer is no. 

Also, it took me a LOT of time to reach this thought process. I’ve regretted SO much, driven myself crazy with guilt that I questioned my Worth and my existence, and it took me a lot of time to climb back up from that black hole. While feeling guilty of the decisions I made that led me to live this life, I lost relationships, career opportunities and my sense of self esteem. And dwelling on past mistakes made me so under confident that it resulted in more guilt. 

Guilt is the worst emotion ever. Don’t let it get hold of you. Never, I repeat- NEVER be guilty of the way your life was, or is. Never ever undermine your journey and your self by questioning the decisions you made. ACCEPT IT COMPLETELY. Accept YOURSELF completely. Be proud of your decisions even if they were the worst. By questioning yourself you seriously damage your self esteem and if you don’t respect yourself, no one else will. If you have learnt absolutely anything from the past and from your bad decisions, then it was all worth it. 

Take my word and save yourself some years."

GetMotivated,fepbm8p,t1_fenx6vi,1579316558.0,"I wasn’t being nice because I didn’t want to be alone or because I was desperate. I was being nice because no one else was being nice to me and so it was my responsibility to be the one to extend a friendship.However it didn’t work because in the end it’s about looks and this is a fact that I leaned the hard way. And when I was fit, I would be the same, extending friendship, yet get more responses from people, because of my looks."
GetMotivated,fenhtld,t1_fenfbrr,1579284997.0,"So true. Gaining weight made me feel that to fit in I would need to be more approachable and friendly. I was trying to get along with people so that they don’t leave me out because I m fat. And guess what? All that being nice led me to have zero friends. Contrary to when I was thin, when EVERYONE wanted to be with me/ talk to me/ be my friend, no matter how I behaved with them."
GetMotivated,fenhgvx,t1_fendckq,1579284778.0,100% agree with the inflammation part. And how your stress hormones are always high. These two things are the reason I started my weight loss journey. Yes it’s great to look good and to feel light and be energetic. But I really want this inflammation and stress to end.

So I’ll store all away and once i feel better, I’ll start keeping what I feel happy wearing, what feels like ‘me’; and then the rest goes. I’ll take it slow. Thanks ! :)"

careeradvice,fdmwhpu,t1_fdmr4d3,1578569014.0,"I suggest - look at the jobs you are interested in and talk to people with those jobs, ask about what skills they use and what are the real responsibilities. And then apply to those that resonate with you. One job interview should not keep you down. Keep looking for more and keep applying. Keep building your skill set. And even if an interview goes wrong, look back at it as a learning lesson. What they asked, what you answered, what you felt was lacking, what they pointed out as negative and how you can improve on everything. Talk to someone you trust who can guide you objectively on these aspects. Brush up your skills as you go along."
