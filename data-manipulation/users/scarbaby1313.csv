AmItheAsshole,ffemsyj,t3_et09ar,1579854912.0,NTA. You had a simple request. He was a jerk about it.
AmItheAsshole,ffbkteu,t3_escpo7,1579770130.0,"While I get the reasoning, I feel that's setting her up to be bullied. 
I really don't think you meant any harm but would urge you to reconsider! If that were my name I'd be pretty pissed off. 

I have a friend who's parents made her first name rhyme with her last name. She was always being made fun of. 

Suggestion.Rosalind: Originates from Latin and means 'pretty rose.' Maybe Rose for short? Honestly though I'm not sure Aurora Rose would be much better. Definitely better than Aurora Borealis. 


At least if you go with Rose you still use half the letters from borealis  
I tried to anagram the letters but nothing pretty comes out of it.  I tried to help some."
AmItheAsshole,ffbk5pc,t3_esgzvt,1579769166.0,"Are you the asshole for telling him he should continue to use protection? No

However when you said in so many words have you seen the implant, it may not exsist? was overstepping. 

I would apologize to your son. A better way to get the point across would be just telling him if he's serious about not wanting kids right now, it would be smart to use condoms still. Accidents can happen. I've never had the implant so I'm not sure if antibiotics will interfere with it.  Just tell him at the end of the day you realize that he is an adult and will do what he ultimately wants to but you reccomend a back up method."

Assistance,ffbfuge,t1_ffbeytt,1579763440.0,Thank you so much!
Dentistry,ff2et44,t1_ff2em0a,1579503161.0,That's what I thought.  I'm just really anxious right now. I have a few close by I can call. If that fails I guess it'll be an emergency dentist
u_appliance-master,fe6s2pa,t1_fe6rba2,1578902738.0,I.e clothes may smell like burning?
u_appliance-master,fe6rba2,t3_emn3di,1578901704.0,Are there any signs that lint is building up?

cats,fe0dndq,t3_engxac,1578811007.0,Happy birthday handsome!
Appliances,fdstp8l,t1_fds6gs1,1578707811.0,Alright. I'll try that. Worse case we have to buy a new dryer but we will already have the vent kit. I'll go pick up a brush to really get down in the trap. Thanks
Appliances,fdqtjld,t1_fdq7k38,1578674567.0,"It is not a ventless dryer. I'm at a loss of what to do. We can either shell out almost 1k for a ventless dryer or buy an indoor vent kit from home depot and hope the current dryer isn't going out. I can also ask the landlord if he can have someone install a vent but I doubt he will. There is no external vent hook up ðŸ˜«. I can see a spot on the back of the dryer where it's supposed to have a hose. I don't know why the last tenants ran it without a hose. 

If I knew this sooner I would have bought the vent kit. I'm afraid to run the dryer at all now even on the lowest setting. 
Maybe we go to an appliance store and buy a cheap dryer and buy an indoor vent kit? Is that safe? It has to be safer than running a dryer without a vent hose."
AmItheAsshole,fdftrnb,t3_ekzr0b,1578370006.0,"NTA. She needed to know. If I hadn't been told what was going on with me, for even a few hours after I got mine, I would have been even more convinced I was dying. 
I saw blood, I got scared, I told my mom I was dying. ðŸ˜‚ I was only 10 and we hadn't had the talk or watched the video at school yet. That was a next year video."
relationship_advice,fdfmd62,t3_el4x7p,1578365039.0,If you don't get a huge response here try /r/assistance I believe they have a survey flare. I would fill it out but my husband and I have been together since middle school (05) so I have no experience with break ups.
AmItheAsshole,fdfkmqw,t3_el4ii2,1578363903.0,"So the slow car was going the speed limit already or over?  I get that's the fast? or passing lane but if they were already going over the speed limit I am gonna say YTA. 

Edit I learned that that's normal. I take back my flashing comment."
relationship_advice,fdfizqj,t3_el4a0i,1578362818.0,"Are you interested in a bf/gf relationship with them both?  /r/polyamory may be able to help. If I'm understanding right you aren't.  There's that in case. 

Otherwise I would be truthful and hope that current bf wants to meet the friend. Just realize he may not want to"
AmItheAsshole,fdfhv45,t3_el4abe,1578362060.0,I say NTA. You are a minor. Legally he's responsible for the bill
Comcast,fdd1ea2,t1_fdd0z3n,1578290956.0,I had no idea those were a thing! Yes that would work
sex,fd0whun,t1_fd018xi,1578124711.0,So much of this
sex,fd0wai9,t3_ejrxa5,1578124628.0,Congrats. Glad it was amazing!
pickmes,fcohv9p,t3_ec0urh,1577832602.0,Where do i watch? I can't find it on hulu or crunchyroll
DeadLikeMe,fc7l8eo,t1_fc7kb34,1577511056.0,I missed that. Thanks
cats,fbnvius,t1_fbn0n19,1577003857.0,"How soon? I thought it was 3 weeks since she went into heat. Looking back it's only been 10 days. She may have just eaten too fast. 
My cat has always been antisocial and mean randomly so I can't really use those as indicators. Google says 15 days then they get morning sickness. I really hope I'm worrying for nothing."
