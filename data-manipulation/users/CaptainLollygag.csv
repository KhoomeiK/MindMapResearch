If you want any suggestions, using Aveno body wash helps a little with the dry skin, as does using olive oil as a moisturizer, or if you don't want to do that then Aveeno lotion. About once a week I use a shower brush to scrub down after I've been in the shower a few minutes, then wash and moisturize. 

I'm still dealing with scalp psoriasis, though. I color my hair so am limited as to what things I can use on my head. Coal tar helps some, T-Gel did nothing. Washing my hair just twice a week has helped the most."

To make it easy math, I start with 16 cups water with my bones and scraps, and cook it down until there's only 1 cup of liquid in the pot (after a few hours I remove the scraps and measure just the liquid, and cook down more if needed). Then I freeze that in a silicone mold tray that holds 1 Tbsp in each section. When frozen, pop those out and individually wrap them, I cut small squares of plastic wrap to wrap up the broth cubes and tape them closed. Store in a bag in the freezer. When you need broth, add 1 broth cube to 1 cup of hot water, stir and dissolve.

Love this, and agree! And I love that your family rotated through your dinnerware. I commented elsewhere in this thread that (other than my China/crystal/silver) my dishes, flatware, and glasses are an assortment of things I like and gatherings from places I've traveled to. In other words, none of it is a matching set, and I love it that way. 

At different times different pieces are my favorite. Right now my favorite fork is one I got in an airport restaurant - I didn't steal it, I asked if I could take it. I love hitting up thrift stores & antique malls wherever I go and seeing if they have any cool glasses, flatware, or dinnerware, and I buy just 1 or 2 to add to my large, mismatched collection. It's not quite a t a hoarding level, but hey, I'll probably live a few more years and will keep gathering! 

My China was hand-painted and is pretty valuable. It's gorgeous, and I've loved it since childhood, where it only came out on holidays and for fancy dinner parties. Since I inherited it, I'm very careful with it, but still use it on the regular. Since my ""dishwasher approved"" dishes are so many, I likely won't buy more China. But I'm a sucker for silver flatware, it just has a nicer mouthfeel than stainless.
