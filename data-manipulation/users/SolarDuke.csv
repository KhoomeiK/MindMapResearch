college,ffx1wh9,t1_ffwyk9m,1580315981.0,"Even with a masters in nanotechnology engineering I could get a phd in physics? My course already has a masters included
The only reason is because I feel like all the math and physics are getting secondary...
Thank you for giving me advice!"
college,ffwtmyj,t1_ffwt22p,1580310724.0,"My objective is too have get a phD even with engineering, and a lot of my subjects are equivalent to the ones in physics. All the math in nanotechnology is the same as the one in physics, but physics will still use them in later sobjects, contrary to engineering. Basically all I had until now is physics and math...and Im thinking of pursuing this path"
