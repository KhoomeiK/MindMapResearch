>If I say you are free to eat whatever you like, and you eat nothing but twinkies- that’s abusing your freedom. You freely chose, but it was societally “bad”. “Bad” is subjective, but in this context it’s usually a “why does God allow Bad” conversation to begin with. If there’s no such thing as a bad choice, then why is anyone up in arms over God allowing bad choices in the first place?  

Well here's the thing.  Some things are societally bad and some things are objectively bad.  Often but not always, a thing is societally bad *because* it is objectively bad.  I'm using 'objective' here with respect to real world outcomes such as wellness but when people say ""this is objectively bad according to god"", they're talking about what their holy book says - regardless of whether it aligns with reality or not.  
There are plenty of things that, so far as anybody knows, only cause harm and suffering and do so not out of any culpable choice made by a human actor.  It's completely fair when presented with the idea of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent god to ask the justification of these things which so readily contradict the idea.  

>Obviously there are reams of paper written on hard/soft determinism- and probably hundreds of others I have never heard of. I’m not sure it’s valuable to get bogged down in the minutia of that. I generally look at it as “free will=could have acted otherwise”.  

I don't want to get bogged down either but I think we have to give the question at least a little attention.  If the universe is deterministic then we are all just acting as we must and nobody can be ascribed blame for anything.  In practice, of course, things like discipline and punishment clearly do affect how people act in future and so we engage in them.  People are free to break laws but the society enforcing those laws will reduce our freedom in response.  It seems to me that this reduces our effective freedom to break those laws.  This may be all well and good but it's a different story when there's a god involved because then you're looking at ""you're free to do whatever you like but if I don't like it then you'll inescapably suffer for eternity"" and that's a hell of a threat.  Heh.  

>Answers creating more questions doesn’t invalidate a line of thinking, in my opinion. It just signals a depth of the topic.  

I suppose that's fair.  I just wish people would stop presenting this sort of thing (""bad things happen because you have free will"") as a full and final answer to the question when it's so clearly not."
