fatlogic,fft7jpw,t3_ev1ui1,1580211027.0,"Yes, putting schedule on how you eat is definitely *disordered* lmao."
fatlogic,fft5m3p,t3_euv44v,1580208348.0,"To be entirely fair, if you eat mostly processed crap, just eating less by enough to put you in deficit is not gonna be easy and likely to give you nutrient deficiencies (if you didn't have some already that is, in such case it might make them worse).

You need to eat properly nutritious foods to actually sustain reasonable deficits without feeling like shit all the time."
fatlogic,ffsxt6i,t3_euxqor,1580196963.0,"Close to sanity with valid observation that you can't outrun a bad diet, and then spiralling into madness.

How typical of fatlogic to take grain of truth and spin it in dumbest possible ways."

fatlogic,ffri1bz,t3_eutsyu,1580158409.0,And whatever they think intuitive eating is... is still a diet as well. Just a very crappy one.

nattyorjuice,ffqk8p8,t3_eumbiy,1580136873.0,"Insulin is anabolic hormone that tells body cells to absorb glucose from bloodstream and impacts protein synthesis as well.

Diabetics either are unable to produce it normally (type 1) or their cells fail to respond correctly to released insulin (type 2). So they are taking external substance, but they do so to make up for what their bodies are deficient at - would say that qualifies as natty."

So much for HAES

\> You can't walk around the corner without someone saying something. Trust me.

Are you a celebrity? No? Then they aren't. They don't give a shit about you at all in fact.

\> Concerning yourself with health of someone who will never actually matter to you is just silly.

How ironic coming from the mouth of person ~~concerned~~ delusional enough to think that complete strangers talk about you all the time.

\> ""I'm just worried about your health"" and other bullshit

Okay. I am not worried about YOUR health. You do you. It will have consequences down the road. Your problem, not mine. However don't spread obesity promoting BS around, affecting health of everyone gullible enough to believe that. For *some* reason we do not celebrate con men."
