interestingasfuck,ffebjn3,t1_ffe1zx1,1579842204.0,"I read somewhere that when filming Bruce Lee fighting, they had to slow down his movements because it was too unbelievable if they left it as is."
Rainbow6,ffeb33z,t1_ffd4ni8,1579841792.0,The warst part is when this happens and they are still at full health

gaming,feqqgyk,t1_feplbf3,1579344901.0,Check out guild wars 2. Way better system
gaming,feqpwhz,t1_fepuad6,1579344655.0,Don't know why you are being downvoted. Guild Wars 2 has probably the best reskinning system I have seen.
gaming,feqpmzs,t3_eq8s1b,1579344582.0,"For real though, I legitimately lose interest in a game if I can't get armor that looks good and has good stats."

facepalm,fel9qiz,t1_fekp6r1,1579217148.0,"Yeah but it is art school, ain't nobody that goes there ever going to pay off 119"
facepalm,fel9nja,t3_epktir,1579217096.0,I mean he just kinda sounds stupid as hell. Also how do you track up 119k at an art school?
Games,fefawv6,t1_fee4vle,1579052287.0,"Pretty sure doom guy is just chaotic neutral. He literally only wants to genocide demons. He doesn't care at all about rules or laws. Since the genocide is of inherently evil creatures, he isn't evil.  Since it is genocide it isn't good.  Thus neutral.  He is more like a force of nature with guns TBH"
Games,fefaa9a,t1_feeey11,1579051872.0,I prefer the fan theory that the doom slayer and link are the same person.

science,fe225yw,t1_fe1nv8y,1578833710.0,Mostly politicians and other famous people. I cannot think of a single time I have heard or read of them saying something that wound up being accurate.
TumblrInAction,fe10fue,t1_fe03xpo,1578821079.0,You mean like how they claim with a straight face that William Shakespeare was actually a black woman.
TumblrInAction,fe1082p,t3_en15fx,1578820973.0,Like the whole point of the song was that he thought that the name sue was cruel but it was that name that made him so tough.  FFS it is a great song
TumblrInAction,fe0mf3j,t1_fdrahwz,1578816041.0,"I disagree, if I am paying extra just to have it delivered, I need it delivered."
TumblrInAction,fe0m98w,t1_fds4mhc,1578815964.0,"The only times I have ever met a delivery driver anywhere other than my door was when I lived in an apartment complex that you needed a key to get to the elevators.  I have had delivery drivers tell me to meet them at the street before in my current house (super easily accessed and plenty of parking on the street)  I responded with, ""I will see you when you get to my door""  if I pay extra to get food delivered, I expect it to be delivered."
TumblrInAction,fe0l2gk,t3_emsewz,1578815339.0,"Like am I the only one that thinks that both people here are in the wrong?  Like the fat person should have put a note on the order that I am assuming he or she didn't.  But also why is the door dash guy parking in a fire lane and expecting the person to meet them in the lobby?  That seems lazy to me.  I have had door dash guys try and pull the ""meet me at the street"" move before which is what it seems like the driver is doing. At the end of the day fatso ordered food to be delivered to their door, not the lobby."

cringepics,fcfad1e,t3_eghxst,1577628008.0,It is even more disturbing when you realize that he is literally a pedophile.
cringepics,fcepvsz,t3_eh4cts,1577622718.0,"Of all the things I have read today that never happened, this never happened the most."
