CasualConversation,ffinqh8,t1_ff4zf6v,1579978276.0,I realized after that “liddle” was a bad example. Do you also say “Twenty” like “Twunny”?
matthewgood,ffi7xtp,t3_erhwxc,1579967426.0,Awesome job dude! The Ocean is one of my favourite pre-MGB tunes
matthewgood,ffi7tbg,t1_fffgxzr,1579967337.0,Sweet!
matthewgood,ffi7nsm,t1_fffch4x,1579967227.0,"My thoughts exactly. I liked the last album a lot but aside from Bullets In A Briefcase, I couldn’t get as emotionally attached to the rest of the songs. This one got me immediately"
CasualConversation,ff51obm,t1_ff4x92n,1579577823.0,I used to design my website. I was constantly changing it and putting up any sort of art I was somewhat okay at. Then Facebook came and I got lazy
CasualConversation,ff4ywbk,t1_ff4dm52,1579575785.0,"Torontonian here! There are some subtle differences. Our “out” and “about” are pretty similar to Americans especially here in southern Ontario. We do however have softer pronunciations of some words and consonants  (we pronounce “Toronto” like “Terrono”, “little” like “liddle” etc)"
CasualConversation,ff4x14z,t3_erkzt9,1579574488.0,"I feel that I’m my teenage years I was very artistic. I wrote a lot and loved designing things. The older I got though, the less artistic I’ve become...maybe a lack of imagination.

socialskills,fcnadbu,t3_ei39ma,1577807306.0,"I’d like to be able to start a conversation with someone I don’t know or know very well. With my social anxiety, I’m borderline terrified of people coming up to me and talking to me. If they do, I can wing it, but the whole time I’m silently critiquing myself (how am I coming across? Am I being boring? Am I talking about myself too much? Am I even making sense). It’s exhausting.

I’m about to go back to therapy (in 10 minutes actually!). I’m hoping I can learn a few things"
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcn9ock,t3_ei3qet,1577806825.0,"Canadian here. It may sound cheesy, but my New Years resolution is to try and really enjoy the little things that make me happy. I’ll be turning 37 and it seems like life is going by so fast. So taking a little time to stop, appreciate and take in little happy experiences is a goal I’m looking forward to"

CasualConversation,fcmapxr,t3_ehxh2q,1577768910.0,"That’s amazing! Good for you!

I have pretty bad social anxiety and I tend to discredit my own feelings and focus way too much on other’s feelings. So, if I’m anxious and I didn’t want to do something, I’d totally feel guilty and nervous that I’m offending someone. Through therapy I learned to do exactly what you are doing and you’re absolutely right - it IS so liberating"
CasualConversation,fcm9w1c,t3_ehy3fi,1577768201.0,"Good for you! Congrats.

My New Years Resolution was the same - I wanted to drop some weight. I managed to drop 22lbs and I’m feeling so much better"

CasualConversation,fckfe9d,t3_ehmme1,1577724103.0,I’m not the biggest gamer but the most recent one that I played and absolutely loved was Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom for PS4. The graphics are beautiful (hand drawn animation too!).
CasualConversation,fckegji,t3_ehm88p,1577723504.0,"Congrats on getting your smell back! 

My favourite smell is an apple pie-scented candle. It makes me want to eat the air"
