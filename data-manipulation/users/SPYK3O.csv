Sure you can put solar panels on the roof of your house or have an electric car. You currently can't really run a power grid on renewable energy, you can't power non nuclear ships, industrial trains, or jets without fossil fuels. You can't refine steel. Running power grids on solar or wind has a completely different sets of problems. They're unreliable and peak solar and wind throughout the day is hours off peak grid load. California currently has a plan to build huge facilities of batteries to make up for this, and the engineering is insane and will be insanely expensive. This doesn't even consider the environmental impact of all these electronics and batteries when they need to be thrown out. Batteries are recycled much the same way as nuclear waste, we might as well use nuclear energy. I also find it weird that technology we know is viable and clean, like nuclear energy and new natural gas technology, are considered by many to be completely off the table."
DestinyLore,ffrxn46,t3_eurtua,1580168221.0,"There's been so much speculation on this for years. Personally I think it's in Central Asia and the ""pond/ocean"" Hawthorne refers to is the Caspian Sea and/or the Black Sea, or even some new inland sea. In fact most of the arguments for South America are pretty jank at best and also all come from the period of the worst writing in Destiny (D2Y1)

I think it fits the lore and geography better than South America. Also the clear Asian influences on culture and architecture. After English, we know Chinese and Russian are commonly spoken in The Last City. Literally every restaurant uses chopsticks. We also know it has to be in the Northern Hemisphere because of the seasons and that it's definitely not in North America from Amanda's story. We know the Iron Temple is near the Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and this was also the base of operations for most Fallen on the planet.  I've come to the conclusion it's probably in the Himalayas. Maybe modern Tajikistan or [Kyrgyzstan](https://worldexpeditions.com/croppedImages/Central-Asia-_-Middle-East/Kyrgyzstan/mountains-813413-484402-1920px-16x7.jpg) I've read a lot of the lore and seen almost every argument on this. I really don't think it's in South America.

Real talk, look into the amount of light energy a place like Io gets to get an idea of the kind of life that could grow there. You see this brought up when people talk about terraforming Mars. Sure you could pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However Mars gets about 44% the sunlight that Earth gets, which limits how warm it could even get or what could grow. Mars also has no magnetosphere so if we filled the atmosphere with gas the solar wind will just blow it away, along with bombarding the surface with ionizing particles. Jupiter gets 3.7% the sunlight that Earth gets. Io also doesn't have a magnetic field, but it's largely protected by Jupiter's while also getting blasted by radiation from Jupiter lol. The surface temperature on Io is also something like -200°F. I guess the point I'm getting at is the prospect of terraforming a place like Io so creatures like humans could live would basically require magic. Not to say alien extremophiles couldn't live there off volcanic heat and eating compounds from volcanic vents. It's very possible these already really exist on Europa and/or Enceladus."
