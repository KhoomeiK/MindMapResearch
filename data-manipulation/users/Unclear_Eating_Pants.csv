I grew up a spoiled snot nosed brat, and my family had a lot of issues. My mother cheated on my father, who was probably the best man I'll ever know. My grandparents passed away just when he leaned about mom's affair. And I was in my angsty ""emo"" phase at around 12, not making anything better.

My father breaks up with my mother and I see him sitting on his bed one night, bawling his eyes out. We locked eyes, but didn't speak. I thought nothing of it and shrugged it off, going to play video games on my old ps2.

Give it a year or so, I was 13 and my emo phase had subsided. Idea recently gotten in a mini-relationship, nothing serious, but mostly just by name. Just so I didn't have to be that one kid at school with no girlfriend.

I was easing my way back into emotional response from before the phase, back around 9 when it started. I started having flashbacks one night about how much of a brat I was back then, which was my first moment of realization about how much of a jerk I was. I stole shit, cussed out family, got in fights.

Then I remembered my dad, bawling on the bed. I knew what it was about that night and didn't say anything. It actually got to the point where it started creeping up my neck, the feeling of guilt for not sitting by him, talking to him. I went downstairs and decided to tell him how I felt. I told him I was sorry for being such a punk-headed jerk and he forgave me, and I felt so whole.

Anyways, moral of the story, dont forget to better yourself. Memories don't serve as a reminder of your failures to torture you. They're there so you can look back on them for advice."

You told me blatantly that I was acting childish, and I accepted it, but didn't think much of it at the time. After a while of thinking, I realized just how childish I'd been(especially as a damn 15 year old), so I grew up. I'd started cleaning  up the house, I'd started caring for the other animals in the house without thought of self-gain, and been generally a better person. 

I honestly wasn't planning this was gonna get me my cat back, whom had been at the animal shelter the past week, but when I woke up one morning I was greeted to her sitting in my room, with my door closed.

It may have been one of the happiest days of my life, and I'd like to thank you, from the deepest, darkest crevices of my heart, for telling me I was being a brat."
