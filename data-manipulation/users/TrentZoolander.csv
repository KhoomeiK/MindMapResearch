I'm not a huge basketball fan. I know of Kobe and what he's done for basketball.

However, I also immediately think about the rape charge that he went through. Can someone clarify that situation for me. Was the rape charge a huge joke or why am I not hearing people saying anything about that? Or does his fame transcend his mistakes?

I caught a guy going through cars in Vancouver early one morning. He ran to his vehicle, a newer model BMW SUV and raced away. The cops told me the vehicle was stolen and shrugged their shoulders at the very notion of someone using a stolen $50k+ vehicle as a getaway car.  

In hind sight, I sometimes wish I would have clocked the guy when I confronted him, all things considered. I just didn't want to be the guy that accidentally hurt someone very badly, especially if they're already in a rough place in life.  
I just wanted the police to do more! You know?"

I loved the news report today about how the city spends +$100,000 per year replacing stolen garbage cans and that grocery stores can't keep shopping carts, so they just stopped buying them.  

Someone actually stole a TransLink bus this year.  

I'm glad your wallet was returned, the person that did that was likely from Saskatchewan. This doesn't happen. Vancouver is suffering from a massive theft epidemic. Businesses, parked vehicles, homes ... and the police just laugh when you call them.

I wish I could buy just pickle juice sometimes because I go through it faster than the pickles. Is making a ""just pickle juice"" a silly dream?"
