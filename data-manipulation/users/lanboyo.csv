Renaer Neverember revived the Moonstars in 1479 DR after Vajra Safahr assumed the title ""Blackstaff"".

In the month of Eleint, 1486 DR, a moon elf mage and Moonstar named Questele was primarily responsible for defending Stedd Whitehorn, the boy Chosen of Lathander. She died trying to protect him.[5]

The Moonstars became active players in Waterdeep, Candlekeep, and Myth Drannor during the Second Sundering, but went underground after the conflict passed.
