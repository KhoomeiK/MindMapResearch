facepalm,feppo8e,t1_feo3ywu,1579327150.0,"Oh firing her was the result of breaking policy.  Not because she broke an arbitrary rule to help a human in need and the company is heartless.  

I think sometimes when we read stories like this that pull at our emotions we forget that there are rules in business that need to be followed for one major reason: lawsuits. 

Imagine she got injured on the way there or something worse.  Regardless of what she might say this situation is open for all kinds of lawsuits because she’s helping a customer in an unorthodox manner and more importantly the supervisor gave her the okay.  

On top of that she has to access customer information that in your training tells you that you can be subject to termination for using in an unauthorized manner.  

As cold hearted as it sounds it’s not the companies responsibility that client X is broke.  It’s not their responsibility that client X doesn’t have friends or family they can call for help.  

But with that said most financial institutions can offer one time small loans for instances like this.  

As a manager my responsibility always is to protect my employees and to do so in a manner that supports the policies of the company that pays us. 

By going rouge these two well intentioned workers put everyones job at risk with a lawsuit.  

If you think firing her was cold blooded wait until 25% of the staff get let go after a lawsuit is settled for millions.  

Last point: when you say you wish companies would “call it like is” is extremely childish and not at all rooted in the real world of adulthood. 

Welcome to the real world where telling people like it is makes you enemy number one. 

There’s a reason companies have to have PR firms word everything they say publicly so perfectly vague. 

#lawsuits

People love to sue companies especially when they call it like it is."
