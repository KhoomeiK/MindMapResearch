ZooTycoon,fgnzedm,t1_fgnxpu2,1580956273.0,"No problem! It's really weird, no idea why it makes multiple folders, but I'm glad it worked for you 8D"
ZooTycoon,fgnir06,t1_fgn6xrt,1580945728.0,"All right! Here we go.  
For some reason, Amazon makes multiple file folders, only one can be used for modding. I don't remember what the 'Wrong' one is anymore, but the file pathway for the folder you want to mod is ' **C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Zoo Tycoon 2'**  


You can put this in your search bar, or if it's not coming up, do the following, I am on Windows 10, if that matters, but it shouldn't be different between operating systems in a way that matters:  
Open your 'This PC' area, or the area where all the folders are, it looks like [This](https://i.postimg.cc/gjVJNgv0/b12934e134.png) and click on the C drive, which I've highlighted. From here, click on program files x86, which I've highlighted [Here](https://i.postimg.cc/x140GwWR/7f305b75ea.png) 

Then, scroll down to 'Microsoft Games', as seen [Here](https://i.postimg.cc/SKCwXHqj/290d3e493c.png) 

Open that up, and you should see a list of games, including Zoo Tycoon 2, like [This](https://i.postimg.cc/Y2ZfV0QK/0a49d696f5.png)

Open that bad boy up, and paste any mods you want in there! It should look like this (you won't have all the mod files, but this is what the top folders will look like in case you're worried you have the wrong place) [Here](https://i.postimg.cc/q7W7QYZ8/4dbfdbdef3.png)

Almost done!

Now you want to make sure you always run from the launcher in that folder, or it won't work, so find the file that says 'Startup' which looks like [This](https://i.postimg.cc/Y0nZzcd7/e26358305a.png) and then right click, and create a shortcut, put that shortcut wherever you want it. This has two uses, first of all it makes sure you always launch the 'right' zoo tycoon too file, and it makes it easy to get back to the folder you want to mod. Because you can right click, and 'Open File Location' to go there instantly, like [This!](https://i.postimg.cc/B6vCcjk8/e931b47d76.png) just, ignore my renamed games.

Hopefully this helps you!"

He should definitely bring it up in therapy, try and gently remind him that therapy is there to help him feel good about himself and his life, if something is making him feel bad, he should bring it up.

1. Talk to your husband first and foremost to figure out what’s going on, clear lines of communication are important. Is it bottom dysphoria? Is the T making his sex drive wonky? (This can happen, it usually evens out after a few years) is it stress? Is it something else? 

2. If it’s bottom dysphoria there are lots of things you can try! Over clothes touching, strap ons, lots of things. Everyone is different so it may take some trial and error, and that’s okay.

3. Therapy is always an option, both for him alone and for you as a couple, remember, therapy doesn’t make you broken, it just gives you an outside party to help you think clearly and provide options! 

4. If he’s okay with pleasuring you, just not vice verse, and he doesn’t super know why or it’s just dysphoria, give it some time. He may even feel a little better after top surgery. I find my chest can be really hard to ignore during sex even on good days, so if he has bad top dysphoria this may also be hurting him, but again, open a discussion, he’ll know better than me.

5. Back to the toy thing touched upon in 2. They make toys for trans men/people with vaginas that are penetrateable, and they can be used together to get him off, if he’s having dysphoria related to wanting to be the penetrating party without a strap on (something I struggle with often) this may really really help, but again, talk to him about it because he’ll know more than me.

And I’m allowed to say that! Because of free speech I can say whatever I want about nazis being shitheads, and if a TERF tries to talk down to me? I can tell them in no uncertain terms to bend themselves over and above their whole fist up into their butthole. 

And that isn’t civil, and that isn’t respectful, and that’s good, because no, I won’t be civil or respectful to fasc or TERFS.

But if free speech had to be civil and respectful, TERFS could say whatever they wanted about me and I would have to be nice to them because they would dress their bigotry up In nice words and ‘well that’s just my opinion sweetheart’, If free speech had to be civil and respectful, I wouldn’t be able to tell nazis what I think about them.

Of course that isn’t getting into the theory that to protect freedom, you have to hypocritically quash those who would oppress others, which I agree with but don’t have time to fully unpack and discuss here without it turning into a philosophical novel.

The point is, you’re wrong, and you totally have a right to say people should be civil and respectful, but you’re categorically telling a lie about a law, and that’s less bueno."

Conservation is important to me, and I’m a huge animal welfare activist who gets a lot of hate from the community around the animals I currently work with (mice) because of my heated demands that we improve our welfare standards.

Vegans like you see things as vastly too black and white, and people suffer for it, both the disabled who are often abused by militant vegans, to the professional conservationists working with animals in captivity to preserve threatened species, to the environment that suffers due to a lack of education in a variety of agricultural ways (locally sourced meat is much better for the environment than almond milk for example)

There’s also the inherent racism of militant veganism, but that’s its own can of worms. Same with the inherent ableism.

However, it never ended up showing it to the public except for one cherry-picked section. That's possibly because the study concluded that there was no evidence that piracy affects copyrighted sales, and in the case of video games, might actually help them.

Now back to jokes

Me: I’m poor to the point where if my in laws weren’t helping me I would be out on the street despite being disabled and actively dying because our hyper capitalist society means I can’t afford basic healthcare, furthermore corporations are as a rule corrupt business oriented monarchies who do more harm than piracy does to their workers by refusing to provide good wages or healthcare as well as putting them in a position where people are expected to risk the health of themselves in order to have a chance of remaining employed, most animation companies in particular are insidious in that they outsource their labor to countries  where there are even less labor rights than in the USA so they can get away with further abusing other human beings and/or feed into a workplace culture that causes early stress related deaths, until corporations begin behaving in a way that isn’t built upon oppression I don’t feel the need to support them, and when there are good companies I go out of my way to support them however I can. Corporations are not people,  but they do abuse people and I will not be part of making them more powerful in order to consume media, if piracy weren’t possible I wouldn’t support them instead I just wouldn’t consume their work fullstop
