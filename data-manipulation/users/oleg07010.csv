funny,fczpwvl,t3_ejpkm2,1578106525.0,"I understand for anyone that did vote for him that he’s unconventional and simple. But at the end of the day being a president is not simple, it involves politics which were uncomfortable with or don’t even understand. When you keep saying that it’s everyone else around you instead of you, maybe it’s you. At the end of the day, we’re all flawed . If you’re president of United States of America that stands for democracy and all that is good in the world and you’re colluding with the foreign powers then how does that make you different from all the other minions around the world? America was meant to keep principals, standards, and democracy of the people to say when the government is doing something wrong. Instead we now pick sides instead of looking at the world objectively. We’re no different from the animals in the book of Animal Farm, where we let our leaders blind us of hypocrisy."
