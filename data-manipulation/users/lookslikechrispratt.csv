HomeNetworking,ffp2hcs,t1_ffo50aw,1580084849.0,"Either way. Bandwidth is always measured in bits. Not bytes. Storage is typically represented in Bytes instead of bits. 

So when an ISP states ""blazing speeds up to 500MB per second!"" You can always count on it being bits instead of bytes."
HomeNetworking,ffp15et,t1_ffmqk9l,1580084179.0,Sbg-6680 is docsis 3.0. It doesn't do anything over 300Mbps.  So yeah. 1 Gig let alone 200 gig will NEVER happen.

HomeNetworking,ffjq9xk,t3_etvanw,1580004211.0,"Your computer network card negotiates speed between the device it is connected to. If the cable is bad and you only connect with two pairs of wire instead of all 4 then you'll only get 100Mbps instead of 1000Mbps. Same goes for the devices in-between. 

So when you replaced the network cable between your PC and the router you eliminated the source of the fault problem and restored your speed."
