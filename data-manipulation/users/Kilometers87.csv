Then I go back to being a worthless, disgusting being and I basically forget about that experience all together.

You'll never lose the chance to commit suicide.  Postpone it by a week, and it's still going to be an option.  

I understand it can be really hard, but you seem empathetic enough to change your date for your family.  That is *so* important.  If you feel that you need to help them out, there may be something else in life that you can also find as being worthwhile.

All in all, I'd say you should play it as it goes.  It's hard to resist suicide when you feel like it, but emotions fluctuate, even
If they are always negative.  Sometimes it feels even worse than others.  Try to see where you could use the experiences you have to help others out.  There are a lot of people who feel like you, that might need to know that someone out there *really* understands what they're going through."
