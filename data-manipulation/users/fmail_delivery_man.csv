Coronavirus,fguhjv2,t1_fgscg94,1581120969.0,Does this mean that a mild winter is advantageous and that spring being around the corner in the northern hemisphere might help to reduce transmission?
Coronavirus,fguh7gj,t1_fgubmo6,1581120725.0,Could just be lack of reporting of mildly ill people.  Wondering how many people are infected in total if this is the case.
royalcaribbean,fgufy78,t1_fgslz9m,1581119835.0,Just use the elevators.  Ships are pretty friendly to people who don’t like stairs.
royalcaribbean,fgufw6y,t1_fgsfhnp,1581119797.0,"This is good advice regardless of the time of the year or circumstances.  If you see a hand washing station, use it.  Carry hand sanitizer or wipes with you and use them (even baby wipes are okay to clean up).  Don’t touch your face!!"
onebag,fgufpx8,t3_f0b3zh,1581119676.0,"You can donate your clothes that you deem as excess.  I’m sure that there are lots of people in China who would appreciate them.  Even a thrift store would benefit from the donation (as inventory for sale).  If not, ship them home."
MinimalistBeauty,fgu0cad,t3_f0be4m,1581111696.0,"I get away with just eyebrow powder, eye liner, mascara, and chapstick.  I wear a moisturizer that also has spf 25.  I’m 33.  I think the secret to minimizing acne and the potential for wrinkles for me is to avoid unnecessary face products (primer, foundation, shadows, contouring, etc).  I also stay out of the sun like 99% of the year and I don’t really drink, definitely don’t smoke, and get plenty of rest at night.  Also, hydrate."
TLCsisterwives,fgtyzbv,t3_f0gawq,1581111233.0,Oh snap
femalefashionadvice,fgqt7hc,t3_ezwjdf,1581030976.0,33.  I wear what I want.
memes,fgqmavn,t1_fgqd6jq,1581026926.0,I think that everyone is aware but it takes a while for culture to shift.  So sad to hear about someone literally giving up their life to save patients.
loseit,fgo8vqy,t3_ezizod,1580962707.0,"I only talk about my methods when someone else shows their hand first.  Then I consider their methods as other ways for me to use on my journey.  Everyone takes their own path but it helps to compare notes in case if someone else has useful information or ideas.

I do not care for negative comments or even mindless commentary bc so and so thinks they’re clever.  I find ways to shut it down by citing information to disprove misconceptions.  By the time we are talking about studies and facts, the other person wants to get away.

That or you can always leave for a bathroom break if someone pisses you off or makes you feel uncomfortable."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fgo61fg,t3_ezky6h,1580960644.0,It’s for the best.  You can’t force it if it’s not there.
AskUK,fgnuxmw,t3_ez8ak3,1580953448.0,"It depends on where you live in the US.  Probably more common in cities, stay away from rural areas...I have anyway.  As a mixed person who is in a mixed race marriage, I get a lot of stupid questions from people and/or ignorant comments or jokes.  Gets lonely sometimes.  People in the US tend to want to hang out with people who are similar to them, so I often struggle with making acquaintances."
ABoringDystopia,fgnu9w8,t1_fgnmelz,1580953043.0,"Lol I’m sure that my in laws think the same about their three 20 and 30 something children, two of whom have been married respectively for a few years now."
AskMen,fgntfdl,t1_fgm07d3,1580952517.0,This is my husband too :(
politics,fgnh1gf,t1_fgmfj9s,1580944711.0,"Don’t need the video.  When you share this link, the photo pops up as a preview.  That’s effective enough."
Coronavirus,fgnc83p,t3_ezdvsx,1580941809.0,Also a great way to early diagnose things like lung cancer/mesothelioma which presents as pneumonia or some other illness that the patient can’t seem to kick.
TLCsisterwives,fgia1j9,t1_fghnz0s,1580813462.0,"Maybe and maybe not.  His kids are an extension of himself, so both of those announcements mean something to him.  He is still a spokesperson for the family in that he gets to talk on TV about what Mariah’s engagement means/what Maddie’s kids mean to him."
trollingforababy,fgi9xgi,t1_fgha2b8,1580813297.0,Basically it’s fake advice.  I like your wording here and I intend to steal it going forward!
trollingforababy,fge3tv0,t3_extnme,1580690735.0,"Just have sex every day.  Every single day.  Can’t go wrong.  Not impossible!...

BabyBumps,fgcouts,t3_expd8p,1580674860.0,Aaaaaaand this is why I’m not telling anyone til I’m ready for the world to know.  So sorry to hear about your experience.
Coronavirus,fgcnxqx,t1_fga4zf5,1580674564.0,"Even if you got it on your hands by accident and touched a doorknob, then someone else touched the knob after you, technically that’s transmission without presenting symptoms.  I’m not an epidemiologist but I know that human hands can be filthy and that washing them regularly is just a good hygiene practice regardless if it’s flu season or not."
GYM,fgcl9x4,t3_exl54p,1580673726.0,"The person behind you in black seems familiar to me.  Wonder if it’s someone that I know.

Anyway, great work!  Keep it up."
GiftIdeas,fgckv4n,t3_expm4o,1580673596.0,I got my friend a bouquet of daisies when I saw her right after she announced on social media.
