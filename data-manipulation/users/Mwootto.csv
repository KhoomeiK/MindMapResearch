Get involved with your city’s politics and you can actually feel empowered and feel like you’re making a change. Unlike national politics, unless of course you’re extremely rich or in some other way highly influential, of course."

awardtravel,fdwpuzs,t1_fdvrhdq,1578761234.0,"Did RT fares for both. Stayed in Maria Condesa in CDMX and VRBO’d a house in PE. The Condesa neighborhood is lovely and that hotel is a really nice 16 room, adults only hotel. Customer service is fantastic and the bar downstairs is awesome. Sound carries though, so if you have loud neighbors you can easily hear them in your room. If you look up that tour guide I mentioned in another comment he can guide you to whatever type of accommodations is best for you in PE, I would make another post for hotels in both cities. Others here know more than I. 

Six weeks is more than enough time to plan, I’d think, depending on what you need to plan for. I did zero planning until the last minute."

That said, I recently did 3 days there and 4 in PE and it was a fantastic trip. Sounds like we’re similar in that I really need some do nothing beach time to really relax on a trip, as much as I love all there is to do in a city like CDMX. Leaving the city to getting on the beach in PE with a drink takes a couple hours."
