ABoringDystopia,fg046gu,t1_fg00cev,1580399829.0,"If the system is designed correctly, whether open or closed source, it wouldn't matter if an attacker knew how the authorization process worked. For example, knowing the algorithm used to do one-way encryption (aka hashing) on passwords before they're stored in the database doesn't help if they're using a good algorithm because the algorithm was designed to mitigate the issue.

Sidenote: Hashing is a way to transform data in one direction. If you run `bcrypt` on a password you turn it from `hunter2` to `$2a$10$pySg4ZDHHJsMxoFNsDTf2./e3SwjfX27gjLCHFO0r5bwTO53EyIwq`. But there's no way *mathematically* to go the other direction. So if you store the latter in your database you can quickly compare what the user provided to the value stored, so you can verify their identity without knowing their actual password.

With closed-source software you have no way to verify what algorithm they're using to hash passwords, or even if they're hashing them at all. With open source you can see what algorithm they're using. For example, prior to closing their source Reddit was using [bcrypt](https://github.com/libertysoft3/saidit/blob/6ef36f0d8417596cb9ea8a48ae00a555dc16734b/r2/r2/models/account.py#L883), which is the industry standard for password hashing these days.

Facebook, on the other hand, [uses their own internal hashing algorithm.](https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/keeping-passwords-secure/1519937431579736/) They also claim to be salting the passwords - adding a random, known string - but since their code is closed source we have no idea if they're *actually* doing it and have to take their word for it.

Nearly all of the encryption and authentication you're using on a day-to-day basis, from the TLS behind `https` to Reddit handling your login, is either open source or based on open algorithms. This is because closed-source not only has licensing fees but also because the open source versions have been vetted by thousands of industry experts because they're able to see how it's implemented and suggest fixes.

That being said, the weakest point in every single system that exists is the people using it. All the system architecture in the world won't help if the administrator doesn't change the default password."
