antiMLM,ffcvz9e,t1_ffcshvx,1579808411.0,It sounds insane to me and just impossible to maintain long term! I currently eat around 1800-2000 a day to lose weight and I'm 5'10 187lbs. I can't imagine eating 800-1200. I'm sure r/1200isplenty would disagree though.

HIIT,ffah54u,t3_esjf2i,1579735624.0,"From what I understand with my limited experience, you can't target fat loss. You lose fat by eating at a caloric deficit and with the right types of food in your diet. 

HIIT will help you maintain a caloric deficit while also boosting your cardiovascular health. Weight training and just regular exercise in general will also help with keeping you healthy and strong while improving your metabolism. 

If you want to lose fat, fix your diet first. It's hard and frustrating but it's the best way."
watchpeoplesurvive,ff97lsh,t1_ff93pef,1579706712.0,"No lmao BASICALLY I was stupid but also was at a gym that didn't have a squat rack for me to do the overhead press. So I in all my wisdom decided to clean the loaded bar to my chest to start the press. Having never done a clean in my life. 

So obviously shit got very real and I started to fall and I decided to tip the plates off (I should have just dropped the bar but I got anxious that it would cause noise). It worked in that I didn't fall but it wrenched my wrist hard to the side. Didn't even feel the sprain till later and it was pretty horrible haha."
watchpeoplesurvive,ff8y6eu,t1_ff8xs4f,1579699861.0,"I think saying catapult was an exaggeration. I'd imagine depending on the situation it MIGHT end up rising fast but in general I think it's not a hazard.

Yeah I did! It still clicks sometimes but it does not hurt or anything. Lesson - don't do a clean with a loaded bar if you've never done one in your life, lol"
watchpeoplesurvive,ff8w8q7,t1_ff8uygk,1579698163.0,"That's not how moment arms work. As soon as one side loses the weight plates, the weights on the other side cause the bar to tilt almost violently to the other side.

I'm losing weight, but not nearly as quickly as people on this sub seem to be. Is such rapid weight loss healthy? I'm not trying to be an ass, I'm genuinely curious.
