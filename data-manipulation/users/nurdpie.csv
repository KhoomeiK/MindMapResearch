bujo,ffchosi,t3_esvf8f,1579799687.0,Love it. It’s perfect! :)
AskReddit,ffazov1,t1_ffax48o,1579748227.0,Why’d you have to ruin it?
Journaling,ffabo5f,t3_eshjx0,1579731756.0,I love it! And I’m really intrigued by that leaf above it. I feel like your journaling probably has an awesome vibe.
aww,ff9wnae,t1_ff9i04r,1579723121.0,"I mean... I’ve never tried it, so I can’t deny that he isn’t telling the truth!"
bujo,ff96eh5,t3_escrsb,1579705927.0,I really like this! I always found the character sheets to be cluttered and confusing. This makes it look so much more organized and easy to read.
bulletjournal,ff8zbo6,t1_ff8ck1j,1579700792.0,"Hahaha, there’s a ‘t’ there, I swear!"
bulletjournal,ff80sx0,t1_ff7ua50,1579663023.0,"Go for it! You are not alone, haha. Minimalist spreads are great - perfect combo of functionality and visual appeal. The more I do minimal spreads, the more I feel that the simplicity and structure helps me feel more organized and calm."
bulletjournal,ff808uj,t1_ff7etne,1579662625.0,I bet it’ll look great. I’d love to see!
bulletjournal,ff7d78n,t1_ff76w1r,1579646835.0,"Haha, hey, I love colorless spreads. Nothing wrong with that at all. :)"
bulletjournal,ff74pt4,t3_es13xj,1579641079.0,I always spend so long doing collage-work or trying to draw and ending up disappointed. I tried to keep it simple this week and was pleasantly pleased with how it turned out.
bujo,ff6z0kw,t1_ff6ywuu,1579637804.0,That’s a fantastic price!
bulletjournal,ff6yede,t1_ff6mvhx,1579637441.0,I’m not OP but I have found a ruler makes it so much easier. Put a ruler on the edge and rip. Instantly straight line.
bujo,ff6y1sw,t3_eryrpj,1579637238.0,This is really visually appealing. You did a great job! I have all of mine in giant washi holder bins and it’s so hard to lift them and see everything. Your display would make it so much easier to see what you have and grab one.
