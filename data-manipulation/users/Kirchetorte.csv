Originated during Obama administration when they were convinced he was Kenyan or Muslim. The hating America bullshit? That’s a right wing echo chamber conclusion, because if you don’t like Trump, you apparently want America to be destroyed.

Fucking LOL! Yeah, the organization tormenting them in the first place, in which they only barely are taken seriously, maybe if they’re over the age of 60. The GOP, and especially their voters, don’t really care for women, and especially minorities, in their ranks. Here’s a common sense solution, though! Maybe the GOP can join the rest of us in reality, and realize it’s not 1950 anymore, and stop trying to limit people’s freedoms based off some hypocritical views on sex and religion. You damn well know they finance their daughter’s/granddaughter’s/mistress’ abortions, but according to them, “well MY case is different.” It’s a lot easier than trying to rebuild the organization, but I realize that would require the GOP to have a conscience in the first place.

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff5nly1,t1_ff4xv15,1579601956.0,"The far right are, no joke, the biggest group of bullies and hateful people in the world. They subsist off of hate for other groups of people, especially foreign and/or minorities. The US is a great example, everyone under Trump’s wing bullies and rages against everyone not in the cult. They call liberals snowflakes all the time, for getting offended or reacting to hostility.

The reality is that it’s the conservatives and the cringey meme maker here that lack awareness. Show some empathy, get some empathy. Yet they bitch and moan, and make up problems like “war on Christmas”, and have an aneurysm if you say a Happy Holidays, yet liberals are the snowflakes? This comic amounts to them saying “Well, I know I’m a raging douche to everyone who doesn’t share my views, but I didn’t expect them to fight back. Now my feelings are hurt! Oh look! An echo chamber of festering hatred, they’ll agree with me! Who needs introspection when you have validation!” Before you know, they get pulled into hating minorities, women, and LGBT

I get that there are some screwy trigger lord, SJWs out there, but just because they are loud, in no way make them the majority. Ignore them by recognizing their absurdity, same as I do when I see literal Nazis in the Republican Party. I know they aren’t the majority, just a disgraceful outlier."

Can you imagine if the same amount of liberals were THAT delusional and out of touch with reality? For example, imagine if because they are pro-gun, that we think they’d make a school-shooting army to murder children?

Enter his extra delusional and white fan base, wearing this propaganda with not a single African American in sight.

So, the difference is...whites wearing BLM merch is in support of their cause. It’s literally being an ally in a fight for POC to just survive without being shot down for being black.

SmashBrosUltimate,ff0do68,t1_feyy8g4,1579467938.0,"I’ll respectfully disagree, just because of the process in which echoes are made. Like Sakurai said, it’s a quick bonus, thrown in and that used very little time. It’s not really taking anyone else’s spot on the roster, just like Daisy, Pichu, or Richter isn’t. I mean, you can even save space on the select screen by rolling the echoes into their respective character, haha!

The hit boxes and move properties are just the bare minimum done not to make em palette swaps, and something as small as “increase speed here, increase knockback there” is enough to put them somewhere different on the tier list than their template fighter.

Lastly, if you’re not a fan of Marth, I get it feels overwhelming having 4 fights play the same. He’s like a fencing style fighter, which is kinda unique, also given he was, what, Smash’s second sword fighter ever. To say NONE of them bring anything to the table is a bit much though. I’m a huge fan of Ike, honestly, and I think they did an awesome job bringing him to life from the game. Quick Draw and Aether are real unique, I only wish his Eruption was his down B and his regular B would be like Sword Beam from Cloud’s set. Ragnell was ALWAYS a ranged sword, but either way, he’s a heavy sword fighter. Robin is also incredibly unique, occupying the mage type FE character slot, with a different consumable system for magic and Levin Sword. Corrin...I’ll kinda agree there, is really strange. I mean...different, unique, sure, but doesn’t feel fun. I also dislike the character and game they hail from.

Anyhow, at least you’re ok with Byleth, so that’s a start. I understand some disappointment, but some issuing death threats and boycotts are...well, a bit extreme."

SmashBrosUltimate,feypr2z,t1_fex4qx8,1579448905.0,"Yeah, the “everyone is here” thing came back to bite Fire Emblem pretty hard, and it’s what caused all this backlash honestly. I shouldn’t have made it sound like “I dunno why 3 Links?!?”, more like....There’s 3 Links and 4 Marths, not ideal, though people are a LOT more upset about FE. I’m still ok with keeping either Young or Toon Link going forward as the “original Smash Link”, since they’ve changed up regular Link’s move set to be in line with BotW. For the Marth A Capella, I’d be more than happy to have them as “premium costumes”.

Thanks for the vote of confidence on Ganon though! I feel like it’d give him the treatment he deserves, while we’d get to introduce a new F-Zero champion, and a villain at that!"
SmashBrosUltimate,feyong9,t1_fewtu9y,1579448395.0,"D’aww, thanks for humoring all my excited ranting, haha! I appreciate the talk we’ve had too, so thanks for that as well! I’ll catch you later, feel free to drop by to mull things over any time!"
SmashBrosUltimate,fewo7ql,t1_fewesy0,1579416816.0,"Yeah man, we demand a better Ganon! I’d even accept a totally NEW Ganon character slot even, it’s just so much wasted potential to have him just mimic Falcon. I always imagined him being able to fly for a short duration with Up B, and the only action he could take and still fly would be firing his B, his deflectable magic blast. It just makes so much sense for Ganondorf.

Honestly, the differences you notice with Marth and Roy now are the same as they were back in Melee, sweet spots, B difference and all, but Roy was still very clearly a clone. That’s just the overall point I’m making, that all clones have some small differences in hit boxes and move properties in Smash, that’s just how Smash does clone/echo fighters. For flavor, one move may be different (Chrom has Aether, Dark Pit has Electro-shock, Dark Sames uses Phazon and...floats?), but using the same rig and animations is the big decider, which those 4 use.

You know, a character that masterfully gets around all that is Wolf. Conceptually, he has the same specials as Fox/Falco. B laser gun, Down B reflector, Forward B Dash, and Up B Charge Dash. However...Literally everything is done different. All his animations and stances are unique, his A attacks, tilts, smashes, everything is completely unique. Even though his B moves share concepts, they are all handled completely different. His B does the most damage as melee range, since he hits with the gun first, then fires the laser, and it is not spammable like the other two Starfox characters. His Reflector is stronger, reflecting higher damage, and his Side B works vastly different, going at an angle, sweet spot at the end, and spikes. In other words, if someone accuses Wolf of being a clone or echo, they’ve likely never played wolf, haha!"
SmashBrosUltimate,fevdi9i,t1_feux6i8,1579396149.0,"So, as far Roy goes, he still uses the same rig and most of the animations are the same. For example, look at his and Marth’s run animation. It’s meant to mimic FE1’s awkward Marth run, and makes no sense for Roy (or Chrom, or Lucina) to have it, as they have totally different animations in their game. The only real difference is neutral A on the ground only being one hit, and the F Smash attack actually has a different animation. That’s not enough, in my opinion, which is why I liken them to Melee Ganon, who shared the same everything, but with very minor modifications. By that, I mean hit box properties, but that’s all very under-the-hood in an attempt to make echoes NOT 100% palette swaps.

Now, on to your second good point, people aren’t complaining about those other echoes simply because the characters are kinda varied and have been spread out, not to mention, are from the most worldwide popular series (Mario). Fire Emblem is pretty young as a series in the US, and a lot of people still never really played it. Couple that with the fact that a lot of the characters look similar to a degree, all use swords, and 4 of them play pretty much exactly the same, well...I understand their angst, but the need to tone it down and look at the facts that I mentioned before.

Finally, yeah, Zelda’s been my biggest disappointment. I’m ok with TWO different Links, I guess, since they changed up base Link a bunch, but 3 is...whatever, haha! New villains, like Skull Kid or Ghirahim would be amazing. Ganondorf is the BIGGEST let down though, especially after seeing how amazing K Rool turned out. I want THAT treatment for Ganondorf, where they rip his awesome moves straight from the game, in a love letter to Ganon fans everywhere! Instead, we have the same, lazy, Captain Falcon rip-off moveset, which only now did they finally change his smash attacks to something more Ganon-esque. The man’s a wizard, he should be able to fly and shoot energy blasts like ALL his games! Keep the heavy Falcon echo with Flame Choke in game, but make it a Cpt. Falcon nemesis, like Deathborne or Black Shadow."
SmashBrosUltimate,fetvojh,t1_fethozd,1579380543.0,"I still only count there being 5, in total seriousness. Marth, Ike, Robin, Corrin, and Byleth. Literally the other 3 are absolutely clones/echo fighters, barely above being a costume. Same rigs/animations/attacks, with incredibly minor differentiations and numbers. They were also last second throw-ins, meant as a quick little bonus, in each Smash they appeared. Like Mario is to Dr. Mario, and Ganon was to Falcon in Melee, they are basically “premium costumes”. That puts the number well below Pokemon and even Zelda reps."

news,fessqx1,t1_feromt9,1579368636.0,"Again, based on what? What proof? Because some shills said so? Every person with universal healthcare says the same thing, that emergency services are available immediately, but there’s a wait in non-emergency services. Also, you can “skip the line” if you layer premium insurance on top of the universal one, and even then, it’d save you thousands a year compared to what we have now. And yes, I’m counting the taxes used to maintain the system. I doubt you’re some millionaire Reddit user, so you’d actually see a decrease in healthcare costs across the board.

There’s literally no downside to insuring everyone, and taking power out of privatized healthcare will allow hospitals to finally expand and hire more ER doctors, rather than the board of directors looking for maximum profit. The healthcare barons are so mortified by this, they actually managed to fool the people it’d help most with obvious lies (like you). If you can even remember the smear campaign against Obamacare, they claimed it’d cause the collapse of society, that you’d lose all your benefits, that your fate would be decided by “death panels”, and we’d genocide the elderly. So...Where’s that apocalypse? All I see is people able to finally afford some coverage, and not be denied insurance for pre-existing conditions.

This latest wave of entitlement just proves it further, that in a game with nearly 80 fighters, the have to cry about how many reps a wildly popular series gets. Let’s ignore the absolute fact that 3 of them are essentially the same as Marth and were TOTAL throw ins based on circumstances, leaving Fire Emblem with actually 5 reps instead of “OMGZZ 10 Fire Emblemz”.

You guys gotta understand...1. No one in the Dems really gives a shit about Hilary. She’s not President, the only reason to reference her ever on our end is to highlight the insanity of conservative group-think. This was someone who was heavily investigated for the crime of being a boomer when it comes to technology, and literally nothing was found. The same type of investigation on Trump and his cronies yielded millions in recovered assets and tons of indictments and convictions, yet you all call the collusion thing a “witch hunt”. Yah, ok...

For 2., yes, there is a difference in just being acquainted and being involved with someone. So, why does Trump deny ever really knowing or being involved with Epstein, even though there’s multiple pictures, videos, and even him commenting on Epstein’s penchant for overtly younger women? Why do Trump and all his sycophants have the same canned response when all their criminal allies get exposed? That’s the point of this post, highlighting a very obvious pattern, that you can only seem to respond with “w-well, what about HILLARY?!?11?!”

That brings this to the last point, and it’s a big one! When any of the Democratic politicians are caught out with anything, a scandal or even sometimes off color comments, they become a pariah. They are basically excommunicated and forced to resign (think Anthony Weiner here). We don’t run around making fucking excuses for them, or look across the isle to find someone even worse to compare to. Frankly, it wouldn’t be hard to do so, Republicans have some awful trash-people, but none of us worship our politicians like conservatives do.

All I ask is they don’t feed lanes by going in on ganks under leveled or half health, not too strict a requirement I’d say.

That said, I will never play jungle in ranked again, purely because of the frustrating toxicity. To them, it was not only my job to win their lanes, but also solo all jungle objectives (which I did do, in most cases). If I manage getting Herald and dragons alone, one lane will always cry about not getting ganked, and if I gank lanes equal and don’t solo objectives (because heaven forbid, they may miss a tower plating to come help), I get told I have no objective control.

worldpolitics,feadex7,t1_fe9lbx0,1578947281.0,"> They arnt even hiding it, thats what makes your response so funny.

There’s zero funny about how uninformed and knee-jerk your reaction is. For linking a source, you don’t understand the material at all.

> So tell me. If the government took $1.50 from every $1 you made, how would that effect you?

That’s not a wealth tax, that’s a marginal tax. Weren’t you JUST saying that there’s a difference? Also, to keep numbers small for you, if you made 20k a year, you wouldn’t be taxed 30k under a marginal tax plan. You’d be taxed 0...Because you’re not a billionaire who’s made well over 10 million in profit. Stop trying to apply things that affect the ultra rich to regular people, that’s a transparent scare tactic by lobbyists that you obviously bought wholesale.

Now, if you want to ask me how the government taxing 70 cents of every dollar I made AFTER I hit 10 million...I’d say it wouldn’t affect me too much because I made 10 million fucking dollars already! You’re dying on a hill to protect greed that actively hurts you, like you’ll see any of that wealth some day. Oh, and don’t try to be moral and talk about “fairness” or some cop-out, because the supposedly richest and most powerful country in the world shouldn’t be losing lives to hunger, homelessness, and preventable disease, but here we are, all to protect some rich baron’s hoard. Nothing fair about that, but what do you care?

> We arnt talking about marginal tax increases here. We are talking about the wealth tax. Which has NEVER been incorporated in American history. And the countries that did try it, repealed it after it failed.

It’s an attempt to combat wealth hoarding, again, if you actually read the link. Rich individuals are just using loopholes to stay in a lower tax bracket, claiming they made under 50k, while money is sent through shells into stocks and slushes. The rich evading taxes is literally nothing new here. It’s forcing an incredibly wealthy minority to reinvest back into the country, with a 2-6% yearly tax...They literally have and make BILLIONS yearly, and you think that amount of tax is “abolishing wealth”. My lord, you people scare easy. You seriously ignore every time that the rich are taxed correctly in this country, we were in a golden age of growth and economy.

Oh, and now you want to use the “it didn’t work in other countries, it won’t work here!” defense? Funny, that one. What about universal healthcare? It works in literally every developed country in the world, but you guys claim it won’t work here, because America! Or...socialism, or whatever bullshit excuses you use. I’m not even saying I’m for the wealth tax in the link, I think a marginal tax would better suit the country, but it’s still only a proposal, by a candidate who isn’t going to win the presidency, and you treat it like the sky is falling."

What it SOUNDS like, is a massive hyperbole smear campaign raised in opposition to raising the marginal tax rate. What the people who buy those lies fail to realize is that it’s not only a tax on profit over 10 million, but it USED to be so much higher in the US, and that’s when we had our golden age economy. You know, the one boomers got to have, and constantly berate the rest of the youth as lazy for not being able to work a summer job, then be able to afford a house and college at 18. The marginal tax rate was almost 90% back then, and they’ve got you all whipped into a frenzy about raising it back to 70%.

There’s no elimination of the wealth, there’d be reigning in of their ridiculous profit and putting it back into the country that gave them their opportunity, rather than giving it to them so they can expand their operations in foreign countries or outsource labor to the Philippines and China.

What I won’t agree on, is that it’d be impossible to have an ending that would prevent the 24/7 bitch fest that this sub became. I’m no Reddit historian, but I think this sub was just a rowdy offshoot of the GoT sub, born out of fanatical love for the show that mimicked the Freefolk from it.

The last seasons and ending, were by almost all accounts...just fucking awful. It’s objectively bad writing. I could care less if my expectations were subverted, but it’s not a case of “this didn’t end exactly how I wanted, waaaah!” You don’t have to be a literary genius to smell rotten writing, and while you may be right that several outside factors played a big role, that doesn’t absolve it from having a train wreck ending. It also doesn’t fix this involuntary reaction of apathy or disappointment many feel. In the end, yeah, it sucks!

Her, Ivy, Sophitia...5 did a great job dialing it down, but the neckbeards raged about it, so they immediately backtracked for 6."

I just found out about that Iranian airliner being shot down in the 70s, all those innocent people and children dying, and Bush REFUSED to apologize?! Like, the fuck! It took 8 years for any reparations to be done too, and it was more an obligation than doing what’s right."

Unless Morde uses his flash and has proto belt, I can’t see how it’s possible to die in his Ult if you’re those 2. You can kite him indefinitely, and his Ult should be up in no time, especially with Zhonys’s or Ashe Ult. I dunno man!"
worldpolitics,fdgdurj,t1_fdgd6jo,1578392089.0,"The facts are damning enough. The accusations are just the cherry on top of the shit pie that is him, but you’re never going to see this man in court over these accusations, because of a gamed justice system. Use your critical thinking skills, as I’ve demonstrated above, to connect the dots. It’s not like I’m out here saying Mr. Rogers ran a secret slave trade sex ring based off zero evidence. I’m saying a man, who was married thrice and cheated on all of them, is chauvinistic and assaults women with impunity, based on his wealth. This same man, almost predictably, stands accused of rape from reputable sources and victims, who are being bullied into silence, of which there is also plenty of confirmed evidence and testimony, even from Cohen. 

You can maintain this “innocent until proven guilty” charade, but it’s going to get you nowhere until you realize the rules don’t apply to some people. That doesn’t mean blindly buy into hate or propaganda, but Christ, at least follow some obvious and numerous patterns to a logical conclusion. Accusation don’t often come from nowhere, there’s usually a basis for them. I’d say these ones are quite credible."
worldpolitics,fdgcegc,t1_fdgak7m,1578389944.0,"You’re not getting any of this...When your connections and money keep you above the law, of course there’s no convictions, how is that a hard thing to understand? You need to remember, we’re officially in a “post-facts” era, where concrete evidence can be “nope’d” away by people who’s beliefs override their perception of reality. This administration officially came up with “alternative facts” to get around saying they lied, I mean...Christ! 

What’s more, you said it yourself, he admitted to sexual assault. He also admitted to walking in on teen pageant dressing rooms, and it’s public record that he was accused by his ex wife of rape. How much of it is truly a stretch to believe he’s a rapist, or has committed statutory rape, when following accusations and these facts? You’re banking on a broken justice system to tell you what everyone else already knows."
