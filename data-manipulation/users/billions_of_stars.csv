But what AE has are a toggle switch on layers that look like a 3D box. When you click that your layer now have new properties. Z position and rotation.

You still can’t do anything however until you bring in a camera form the layer menu. Now when you move that camera around your layer will move in “3D”. 

It’s really better to think of sheets of layer then actual 3D. Nonetheless you can do cool stuff which is all basically old school Disney was doing. Just tons of layers and parallax movement. 

Anyhow I will say this: compares to actual 3D programs AE’s camera and 3D are absolute trash. Really not fun to work with. You use a real 3D program and you’ll want to punch AE in the dick."

nextfuckinglevel,ffpyqyv,t1_ffpy2dx,1580111317.0,"For rotoscoping, frame by frame masking of elements, you would much MUCH rather do it with Mocha and/or Silhouette.  I'm decent at Mocha but just starting to learn Silhouette.  Silhouette is made strictly for Rotoscoping.  I got the two programs on sale and it came to 2,000 if that says anything.

For masking out a single image I would likely use Photoshop and then import into After Effects unless the image was really simple, then I would just mask it out in After Effects.

The deal with rotoscoping is that the mask in After Effects are SUPER FUCKING ANNOYING to use.  The points are hard to select and it's overall just not great.  Mocha is much better.  And when you are doing a frame by frame masking and your subject is moving around in the frame you really want to be tracking the object, stabilizing it, and then masking it out.  So, with Mocha you would create a track, and then your mask you would ""link"" to that track.  The motion of your mask follows that track and then you juts focus on drawing the shape of your subjects shifting geometry.

Generally, rotoscoping is kind of like janitorial work in VFX.  You have to be patient and thoughtful in how to approach it and some shots are much harder than others.  But if you know how to do it you can do it much quicker than someone new to it."
nextfuckinglevel,ffpxyhb,t1_ffpxu6v,1580110282.0,Cool!  Glad to hear it!  It's fun to share this stuff.  I've learned pretty much everything from people online so it's encouraged me to share :)
nextfuckinglevel,ffpxjer,t1_ffpwxc4,1580109746.0,"Some people are faster than others but this took hours at least.  But there are always ways to speed things up with various plugins and what not, like for say duplicating the church parts and creating animated arrays or whatever.

But the really time consuming part is imagine you take a photograph and it's got 6 people in it and behind them is say a bunch of people in a restaurant.  And I say take this photo and with some scissors I want you to cut out two people out of the photo.

Well, you can't cut too close to the person because you will cut into to them...and you can't cut to far from the edge because they will then have a border around them from the background.

The more complex the edges of the figures the more precision is needed.  

Then, let's say your character has something obscuring him a little bit...like say someone else's arm.  Well, now you have to cut that out but now you have a hole in your character.  So, then you have to ""clone"" parts of your character to fill that gap.  

So, let's say you now have perfectly cut your figure out.  Well, now you have to start animating it.  You have to apply the puppet tool (or other means actually) and then you tweak, delete shit that doesn't work, start again, tweak more, see how it looks.  Great, you have it rigged but now you actually have to start animating it.  So you manipulate the points on the puppet mesh...but you have to time it right or it looks un-natural.  

Then you have to time those puppet pin tools to the camera you're moving in through the space.

oh, did I mention that the puppet tool doesn't like being turned into a 3d later inside of After Effects?  Well then, now you have to turn the puppet tool layer into a ""precomp"" which collapses it into a nested layer.  And now if you want to re-adjust any of those puppet tools you have to double click and go inside the precomp layer.  Want to adjust your camera again?  Well, you have to click out the precomp layer and then back into the layer with your camera.

It is just a shit ton of little things, and tons of little gotchyas and frustrations that add up.  And this doesn't include various effects that can all be keyframed and animated.  Like the rotating of the church elements, lighting effects, and whatever else.

This is a relatively simple animation I'm literally working on right now.  These are layers of trees, and grass, etc.  It gets complicated quick if you aren't super organized:

nextfuckinglevel,ffpwdax,t1_ffpu0qj,1580108308.0,"It 100% is After Effects.  How it's done:

1) Mask out the figures in either Photoshop or within After Effects. 

2) Apply the puppet tool to the figures which is why you see them covered in a polygon mesh briefly.  This is how you can warp the image to emulate them moving.  It's sort of like a stretched sheet of rubber with an image printed on it

3) then mask out a ton of the church elements

4) Turn all layers into 3d layers (2.5 3d really) and then position it all in 3d space

5) move a camera through the environment

AfterEffects,fffehzd,t1_fffcmvq,1579882203.0,"You aren’t cutting stuff up. And complexity is one of the reasons you would be compelled to use it. As stated in another comment there is a time and place for all scripts but I’ve found this one pretty useful. 

For example on this project I have various scenes represented as precomps. Inside those comps I have a series of animations that will be following a voiceover which will be inserted later.  I set markers that have in and out durations  of each animated sequence and give them a name. 

Then in the master comp I bring in the audio for that scene alongside that precomp. I “extract” the markers and they are laid out on top of the precomp also revealing the duration sliders. Then it’s a matter of aligning those markers with the audio. If the audio changes I just slide the markers around. 

Now, I haven’t used this a ton and I’m sure here are instances you would have to be thoughtful. I’m sure a greatly sped up or slowed down section might be weird but I tend to avoid setting the initial animations up with that much variation. If I make a 1 second tween it’s not going to be a big deal if it’s slowed or sped up a bit.

VIDEOENGINEERING,fe6qbvs,t1_fe6eewe,1578900435.0,I think that must’ve been the program I saw the guy using.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe16c17,t1_fe0chbc,1578823039.0,it's great!
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe1673r,t1_fe0eq12,1578823004.0,"Everyone is ""fake"" to some degree when you have a camera or mic pointing at you.  As far as I can tell Conan seems to be a decent human being."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe15veb,t1_fe06lvu,1578822865.0,I 100% recommend his podcast.  Good shit.
electronics,fe0j0di,t1_fbzb3ys,1578814159.0,What sort of leds were you using?
electronics,fe0ivo1,t1_fbzvp31,1578814097.0,The comment I was looking for.

Not sure."
AfterEffects,fdzgzdk,t3_en1ztl,1578790135.0,"I hate to be this guy, but: learn mocha. It will make your life a million times easier. The learning curve is worth it. As far as I can tell the rotobrush is garbage. It might have edge cases but I wouldn’t bother. If someone knows otherwise please let me know."
AfterEffects,fdzg6xr,t1_fdx9nun,1578789947.0,There may be no need to hop between softwares but using photoshop would make this a million times easier. The latest release of Photoshop has insane new tools for auto selection etc. I would then just use AE for animation and maybe some light masking.
AfterEffects,fdzfsec,t1_fdteh09,1578789803.0,What did you use to animate the robot?
AfterEffects,fdzeg8o,t3_enfy5u,1578789430.0,"I’ve found the rotobrush in AE to be pretty bad overall. If you’re looking for a way less aggravating process and much cleaner results I would suggest using the mocha plugin which comes with AE. 

basically you track any moving footage and then your masks follow that tracker. Then you animate your masks to maintain the shape. I just did a ton of it. 

Anyhow, with the green brush try drawing more inside the object"
boardgames,fduhiyx,t1_fduffju,1578733075.0,If it makes you feel better I think it makes the game better.  Feels like you have more options and it's fun to try to get new powers.  That being said I find that game overall kind of lame these days.
boardgames,fduh7o6,t1_fdtd84a,1578732936.0,I liked the tower the one time I played it.
Cyberpunk,fdge365,t1_fd8iv3x,1578392418.0,I just finished the latest season of the Expanse and the word cyberpunk definitely floated through my head a few times.
Cyberpunk,fdgczxa,t1_fdfz8gr,1578390829.0,"I think that a lot of cyberpunk, whether they like it or not, were somewhat fashioned by Blade Runner and probably something like Akira, etc. 

We almost need new definitions because what you described as cyberpunk should probably be a different word. The word punk also can’t be ignored, right? Punk itself has a contrarian tone built into it. 

The artwork to the card game Netrunner is sort of what I’m getting from your description and though that would definitely be described as cyberpunk it’s not early as grimy as something like Blade Runner.  

Fuck it. Let’s just call it all science fiction!"
interestingasfuck,fdg73o8,t1_fdg4anv,1578382727.0,"It's a fine line I guess.  I've always hard a hard time dealing with shows and movies that sort of break the universe they've created.  For example It's the reason I had issues with the Alien 4 film.  That movie, on its own, had some interesting concepts, but it did not at all belong in the universe already established.  I guess it kind of falls into the realm of failing to keep up the suspension of disbelief.  

It's not jumping the shark really, but it has that same vibe of ""what the fuck?  The Fonz jumping over a shark is just way too wacky for this show."""

I wish they could stick with a particular voice. The feral girl was fun and funny but didn’t fit their current style."
gaming,fdfvf1o,t1_fdftyo8,1578371252.0,That's unfortunate.
gaming,fdftjw6,t1_fdfsrwg,1578369850.0,They probably did that to force a confrontation in case all the players are too good.  YOU WILL ENJOY OUR GAME ON OUR TERMS!
gaming,fdffqa2,t1_fdfcxlm,1578360636.0,"Oh nice!  def gonna grab that. For anyone else reading this is in the 3rd pack.

EDIT: of course I already own it.  I should have known.  Also the T-shirt one is in here."
gaming,fdfc79p,t1_fdf8e9x,1578358251.0,"Drawful is great.

I also highly recommend the T-shirt war one and the Bidiots one.  Both drawing games and both really funny."
