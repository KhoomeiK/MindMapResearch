AskReddit,ff99j0q,t3_esdjf7,1579707944.0,"I used to live in Vietnam, and dog theft happened all the time. Unfortunately, 2 of my dogs fell victim. It happened 13 ish years ago when I was 10-11, and until this day, every time I think about them, I could never seem to forgive myself, I feel like I had failed to protect them and because of that, they ended up in someone's stomach, they probably died a painful death... I don't cry anymore thinking about them but the guilt is relentless."

LifeProTips,feoea90,t1_feoalm4,1579298968.0,"Do you happen to know why hospitals overpay stuff like that? It just feels like if they're such large entities, they would get better deals, no?"
LifeProTips,feodzrj,t1_feoc0yj,1579298797.0,"Wait, really? So, we would never truly find out if they up-charged something unreasonably?"

LifeProTips,feobzcm,t1_feoamzi,1579297949.0,"I'm terrified. It just feels really unethical to prey on the weak, especially when it comes to urgent situations or emergencies, during times like that patients don't actually have the opportunity or time to compare prices, which will eliminate any competition - an essential thing to keep prices low. \*sighs\*"
LifeProTips,feo8ljp,t1_fenw90a,1579296616.0,"I am terrified after reading these comments recounting people's bad experiences with the billing. It just seems so so SO unethical, most people would just glance over the bills and pay the unreasonable price. Thankfully I haven't been in any major accidents that require hospitalization, but I'm taking notes just in case!!"
LifeProTips,feo7il9,t1_fennkxy,1579296211.0,"I just want to ask - do hospitals or whoever that does the billing for them jack up the price/charge an unreasonable price for, say, Aspirin or BandAid? Do they actually do that?"
