Also no one lives at the house, but my dad goes there almost everyday to continue working on it. My mom has started saying she wants him to sell the house so I am hoping he will do it soon before I get fined anything else, but I fear I would have to wait until he is actually finished with the repairs and I dont know how long that is going to take. He is basically doing it alone."

Maybe not a week but a few days. I figured if my friend isnt talking much that they just want space so I do not bother them while they are quiet. So I am saying I just let them break the silence nowadays. Sometimes I do but not as much as before. I also find that they often stop answering in the middle of conversations which i find totally rude, but sometimes he falls asleep. If it bothers you I think you should bring it up and just ask her why she goes silent sometimes. It may have nothing to do with you."

My boyfriend usually has a higher sex drive than me, but not always. We just masturbate alone if we cannot get it from each other. Or we help each other out by putting on a show or giving oral sex. Does your boyfriend at least try to help you out when he is not in the mood like with oral/fingers etc? Has his sex drive always been much lower than yours? Its early into the relationship. You should be pretty crazy for each other still. And lastly it may honestly just be that you are not compatible suxually.

They will do so when they want. Your only options are, 1) Stick around and hope she changes, 2) Break up with her, or 3) Accept that she is a drinker and smoker. If that is not the kind of girlfriend you want you will have to break up with her. There is no point of proceeding further in the relationship if this will continue to bother you.

You could try a diaphragm tho if you havent. Its a little flexible dome shaped bowl you insert into your vagina before you have sex that covers your cervix. You should use them in conjunction with spermicides tho. I think I would only use hormonal birth control if its for a short amount of time, less than half a year but I am not completely opposed.

wemetonline,fem9iys,t1_fejeskb,1579244796.0,How did you guys make the decision to become long distance spouses? My boyfriend and I briefly talked about the idea cuz we are not sure when we will decide to get married. I had assumed he wouldnt actually be on board but he said it would pretty much be the same as it is now. I on the other hand just hate the idea of not being with my husband. It just sounds so wrong to me. His idea was to have the civil ceremony first but me not moving in yet (I think so that my parents would be on board with me traveling to and from Germany) and then having a wedding after he gets his new job and then me moving there permanently after. Are the requirements to get residency tough in the netherlands ?
wemetonline,fem8r88,t3_epg8f7,1579243908.0,"I was the one who was left behind. It was really hard. We both cried so much the night before he left, and the day of and for like months after. Its really difficult especially if you dont get to see each other often.  My boyfriend said he had tears in his eyes going through the airport and on the plane ride. I think it was especially hard because we didnt really know when we would see each other again.

offmychest,fehzbbx,t3_ep5d4a,1579126915.0,"Are YOU bisexual? If not why did you stay with your partner? I know you would like to think that a lot of people would be okay with their partner transitioning and the truth is most wouldnt, just like you werent. A lot of people would try hard like you, because they love their partner and theyd try hard to ignore the changes or try to like them, but how can you? If you simply are not attracted to the same sex this does not work! You did more than you really had to do and for what? For everyone to turn against you and call you transphobic. And then she called you a dyke... what does this mean? That she wants to be with a man? Why did she not leave you before the transition if she didnt want to be in a lesbian relationship?

What has happened to you really sucks and I am really sorry but I can assure you that you are not transphobic. Not wanting to kiss, date, or have sex with a trans person does not make you a transphobe, just like how a straight woman not wanting to do any of those things with a lesbian doesnot make you a fcking homophobe. People are so quick to slander straight people and shame us for our sexuality and preferences while they cry about how the LGBT people's sexualities are being shamed. Its okay to be straight. Its okay not to be attracted to same sex. Its okay and totally normal and EXPECTED for a straight person to no longer be attracted to their partner physically if they change it drastically in a way you never really wanted or imagined. It is ILLOGICAL to expect a straight person to become bi or to accept a sex change fully and easily. You may not have your family and friends support but know that you have mine. And in my eyes you did more than you had to, and all because you truly loved the person you fell in love with. And I think that shows that you are not a bad person and that you were a good wife."

The best way to describe it is that it feels surreal to actually be sitting together and looking at each other without a screen and actually being able to touch each other. Its like omfg this is real??? And he was exactly like he was online. I definitely suggest video chatting or facetiming first before meeting. One person on here has said they did never even seen a pic of them before their first meeting but I 100% do not recommend doing that especially cuz of your age. Its just not smart to be honest.

Our first kiss came after our first date outside on our way back to my house. You just gotta do what feels right and go with the flow. You should try not to plan a whole lot. If your bf would turn out not to be who he said he was or was just not what you thought you need an exit strategy. Always meet in public and tell your parents where youre going.

They are at a point in their lives where theyre supposed to have their stuff together and they do not. I understand that what Syngin went through was traumatizing and Tania had no right to tell him to get over it. But he does need to take responsibility and get therapy if he needs it.

Like one time my boyfriend showed me this video and the guy was older and fat and i was just like EW why would you wanna see a young woman getting it from an old guy? Apparently it was like he didnt even exist! lol

 I find that I just enjoy men enjoying sex which probably sounds confusing since there are men in straight porn, however in straight porn the men are often extremely quiet. Also the camera is focused on the woman a lot and they do all the moaning/screaming which turns me off a lot of the time. I also cant help but feeling that the girls dont actually wanna be there.

When I lost my virginity with my bf, we already kinda had a sexual relationship online for years first. So honestly in my eyes, I was already a sexual being. So having sex in person for the first time didnt make me feel very different at all.

All I can say is that the first sexual relationship you have is pretty important because it shapes how you will view sex. I also think the person you first had sex with is often the hardest person to let go of, even if they may not be good for you. Not that you need to have a ton of partners but more than likely you wont only have one in your life."

I dont want to sound rude but at times he would name,  in my opinion, very immature or strange reasons for wanting to be a woman. For example he said one reason he wants to be a woman was because there werent really a lot of sexy clothes for guys... Sometimes I dont know if I should take him seriously or not to be honest because it often sounds quite ridiculous. I also have heard that many cases of gender dysphoria in boys/men are actually because of a sort of a fetish of the female body. Im not sure if you have heard about that maybe."

She said WE CANT HAVE SEX CUZ OF MY PERIOD so i honestly think she is just being dumb to be frank. I gotta say a lot of women sure do know how to make us look bad when it comes to not being able to handle rejection of any kind. This is just nonsensical. If i tell my boyfriend too bad we cant have sex cuz my back really hurts today or whatever else, him agreeing IS NOT rejecting me, because there was no initiation of sex. Good luck man."

90DayFiance,fclw7wd,t3_ehnym2,1577757975.0,Do you think your parents were easier on you than on Mursel because you are a woman? Do you think it wouldve been worse i you were the man and your wife had 3 kids?

sex,fcczmrj,t3_egwz3z,1577604553.0,"99%? That is not true!

Have you talked to her about how this makes you feel? I will admit I was kinda like this to a way lesser degree in the beginning of my relationship. specifically the thinking what he asked for was weird. However my bf let me know it made him feel bad and that I needed to be more accepting. I think my issue really was that I was projecting my issues with my sexuality onto him. May I add I was a virgin and was sexually abused growing up. I guess at times I simply just wasnt in the mood to do whatever he asked for as well? I dont know but I yea Im not like that anymore. Also I love when my bf cums!"

LongDistance,fcaf16n,t1_fc8wbwt,1577568113.0,Dont be shy :D Im sure he wouldnt mind helping you pay for it if it means he gets to be with you for a few weeks :). I would say try to book at another time but you are a college student so your options are limited and flights to Europe are crazy expensive during the summer. I would say go for at least a 1 stop flight because the nonstop flights are more expensive. When I check flights from me to Germany depending on the date the nonstop flights are around 900-1500 and more.
LongDistance,fc80lvz,t3_eg675o,1577523677.0,"I think youre making the right choice. Honestly I feel like he is afraid of actually being close to you. He might be scared of commitment or he might be living a double life. I know that is a big accusation but you guys do not live an ocean apart from each other. He has too many excuses when you guys shhouldve already met each other. Also the fact that he refuses to let you come to him is kinda suspicious. Would honestly make sense if he was already married or something crazy like that. Honestly if you know his address I would say just go pop up and see whats up (unless you think this is unsafe then dont). 

My boyfriend honestly postponed meeting me several times because of financial issues, but he flat out told me if he didnt meet me last year I could leave him. But we did meet. Did you tell him that you will move on if this meeting doesnt happen? Maybe you should get him to send you his work schedule so you can confirm if he is actually busy. Idk something's very fishy about this guy."
LongDistance,fc7ysu6,t3_egfs9m,1577522258.0,Do you think your bf would help you pay for the ticket? Also how much would the ticket cost?
LongDistance,fc7y6y3,t3_egicl3,1577521787.0,"Its kinda hard to say if he is really catfishing you or not. But it is fishy that the videos of himself do not show his face. You could always try reverse searching the pictures he has sent you to see if they show up anywhere else, but somehow I think he really isnt catfishing you since he actually occasionally sends pictures. Is there any reason he hates pictures? Does he have some kinda mental issue? Not to be rude but I think this is pretty strange. And do you think that never facetiming your bf for lets say 2-4 more years is acceptable for you?"
LongDistance,fc7xeo9,t3_egjxgh,1577521173.0,Honestly she is being highly suspicious. I would not be surprised if something was indeed going on withh her >friend Michael. Im not sure if you should look into her messages or not tho because I fear you will find something you really dont want to see. Just get her to explain herself and confess what she has done wrong. Whether you snoop through her phone is up to you.
sex,fc7lyk5,t3_dwq5f4,1577511773.0,This makes me really sad. It sounds like these girls need a lot of help. Why have sex with someone if you uare not comfortable? Makes no sense.
sex,fc7k6gl,t1_fc7e5i9,1577510050.0,I think this is a good way off thinking about it.
sex,fc7jthw,t3_egicvn,1577509700.0,"I personally think you really shouldnt force your partner to do something they dont like. If my boyfriend actually didnt like giving oral I think I would be totally fine with giving him oral still cuz it is something I like doing. I would only have a problem if he visibly showed signs of disliking going down on me in the middle of the act or something lol. But I dont judge guys who may be a bit disgusted by the thought of going down on women, because at one point giving head sounded gross to me too. So I can understand. There are women who really just do not care to have a penis in their mouths and those who are actually disgusted by semen (to the point of vomiting to the mere thought of it. Not even exaggerating)."
relationships,fc6mofm,t1_fc5qcwx,1577484207.0,You guys need to come up with some kind of calling schedule however sometimes things spontaneously pop up and he should be understanding and supportive of you in these instances. It definitely doesnt  sound like he is. I have to be honest and say it doesnt sound like he really cares that much about you. He is too lazy to fit calling you during the work week into his schedule when it literally takes no effort. He should be happy to hear from you but overall it just sounds like you are a nuisance to him. Let him know what you need and let him know he is failing you as a boyfriend.
