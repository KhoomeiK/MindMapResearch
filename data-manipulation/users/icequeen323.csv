JUSTNOMIL,fee27rb,t3_eonf72,1579024866.0,"As someone who works for a security company, if the system is actively monitored it has a password associated with it. If JNMIL knows the password for the account she can still enter the home and have the monitoring station disregard the alarm by giving the verbal password. She can also change the user code and add a code of her own. You will need to get the system in Your name only, set a password that only you know and have a note on the account that JNMIL is not to be given any information."
