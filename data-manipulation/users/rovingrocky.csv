suggestmeabook,ffe9zu3,t1_ffe4dvp,1579840834.0,"I ran this book for a book club once. That was a mistake. You had a month to read it and no one finished it. but what was interesting is that we all read it differently. I meticulously went page-by-page reading every footnote and following it to the appendix and then solving the riddles presented in the various appendix and then going back to the place I started. I got about a quarter of the way through. Another lady read front to back without going to the appendices at all, she got about halfway through. and another person didn't even read any of the footnotes, they got 3/4 of the way through. All of us had very different insight into the story. Keep meaning to get back to it but it's a project not a book."

dogs,ffcfwsb,t1_ffc129c,1579798595.0,Yeah I see the problem with phrasing there. Um I was sort of categorizing by recipe ingredient. Focusing on the  cornerstones of putting a meal together rather than the specific nutrition from those blocks. Calcium was its own category for me because the rest naturally falls into balance via meat & veggies but my protein/veggie ingredients don't always get enough calcium in. My bad.

dogs,ffcf3eq,t1_ffbum0d,1579798095.0,"Allow me to clarify, I mean it's fine nutritionally, not that any grain free dog food is specifically well balanced. I was coming from a place where I make my own food.

I agree that anyone using ignorance in marketing food via trend is likely not focused on health. Here's an article that goes more in depth into the issue https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2018/11/dcm-update/"
