If you got snapped and blipped you would have lost 5 years and when you came back there would be so many questions like where did all your stuff go, do I still have a job? While I was gone did any friends and family who didn’t get snapped die?

So if I stayed, it would depend on who got snapped from my life. Would life get better or worse after that for 5 yeasts? Would I have gotten promoted? Was Thanos right? Would there be more resources for me?

Maybe you are wondering what’s so bad about why it’s wrong to move on from a rejection and finding someone else? In which case the wrong part is telling OP that she was the 2nd choice because that is extremely rude and insincere.

Or you were wondering why OP feels bad about saying “yes” well that’s because the guy was rude and insincere. As a person should like you for you and you alone. Not because of some “ranking”."
wow,ffbnyt0,t1_ffb63xo,1579774955.0,"Well... you could try a completely new MMORPG. Sometimes that may help.

I was very happy my first year of FFXI because I got see explore a whole new world as a whole new type of hero and meet a sever full of different people.

Then I went to WoW and pretty much the same thing happened again. I believe it’s because MMOs just give you so much to explore and it’s fun. Well the good ones apparently.

wow,ff33brj,t1_ff3107n,1579532598.0,"I don’t want to play as an ogre at the moment but I have some reason if you are curious.

For one in Warcraft lore ogres have been part of the horde longer than many other races today. So it makes sense to have ogres in WoW as Horde aligned.

It fits into the aesthetic of the Horde. Ugly but powerfully intimidating, tribal themes and lore wise can also use magic.

The /silly jokes would be hilarious!

The only drawback I can see is that we already have ogre models in game and they are quite massive. Too massive to be used for players as they would easily dwarf taurens. So a small ogre model would have to be made but I don’t know if people want that. But I think it wouldn’t be too much of a hassle.

Im sure ogres were already one of the intended races to play as but maybe they still haven’t found out how to make it work yet.

If we were talking about guns and I tried to act like a know it all without ever handling a gun and she replied “you know I carry, right” in that context she means she would know better because she has a permit and knows what she’s doing.

But if we were in an argument and she disagreed and used the same line it implies she means to use the firearm as a threat to stop me from making counter points and I should fear her.

I get it, the whole gun thing. I do. The firearm gives you power, makes you feel strong, the power to change history. To defend a life, to take a life. Power to decide who lives and who dies.

That’s why people say things like, “you will take my guns over my dead body!” It’s because without the guns you feel helpless. Because you know the truth is that without the guns you are simply... weak.
