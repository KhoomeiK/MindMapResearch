r/politics is well known for being pretty unilaterally left with little to no room for balanced discussion of right wing politics or criticism of left wing politics. As echo chambers usually go, the acceptable positions to discuss move further left and become more extreme and it seems as if the users of r/politicalcompassmemes, who are willing to meme on/laugh at all political stances, are wary of this influx of users from this sub."

People on Twitter are mad because of course the are. People on the left are mad because of the narrative that he's an ""alt-right gateway"" (despite routinely having guests from both sides of the political spectrum along with plenty of non-political figures like artists, fighters, and recently Robert Downey Jr.), and Bernie Sanders is wrong for being proud of this.
